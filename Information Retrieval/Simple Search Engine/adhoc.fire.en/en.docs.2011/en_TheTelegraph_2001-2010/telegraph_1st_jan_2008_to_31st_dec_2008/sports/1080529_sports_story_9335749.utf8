The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shaun Marsh century blows Royals away
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shaun Marsh century blows Royals away
                                  Shaun Marsh after reaching his century on Wednesday		    
	Mohali: Shaun Marsh smashed a mesmerising century to lead Kings XI Punjab to a convincing 41-run victory against Rajasthan Royals in their inconsequential IPL encounter at the PCA Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Put in to bat, the Punjab team, riding on Marshs 115-run knock reached a massive 221 for three and then restricted the visitors to 180 for seven in their quota of 20 overs.         
	Young leg spinner Piyush Chawla was the most successful bowler for the hosts with brilliant figures of three for 35. Niraj Patel (57) and Yousuf Pathan (39) did their best for the Royals but their effort was not enough to overhaul the big target.         
	Though both the teams have already made the semi-final grade, which made the match inconsequential, yet the Punjab team enter the knockout stage with the momentum.         
	It was just the third defeat, coming in absence of regular captain Shane Warne, for the Rajasthan team out of 14 matches they have played so far in the tournament.         
	Earlier, Marsh notched up his maiden IPL century as the left-handed Australian was in a furious mood and punished the rival attack, sans Warne, to all corners of the park.         
	He produced a scintillating 115-run knock off just 69 balls and his amazing century, sixth of the tournament, was studded with 11 fours and seven sixes.         
	Skipper Yuvrajs late blitzkrieg helped the team get past 200 run-mark. He hit a blazing 16-ball 49-run cameo before getting run out on the last ball of the innings. The southpaw smashed two four and half a dozen sixes, including three consecutive in Siddharth Trivedis over and shared a 80-run stand with Marsh for the second wicket.

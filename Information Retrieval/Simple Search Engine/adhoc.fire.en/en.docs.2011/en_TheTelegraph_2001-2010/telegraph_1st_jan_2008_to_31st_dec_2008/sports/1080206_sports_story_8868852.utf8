    - SANIA decision bangalore open organisers cry foul           ANIL BUDUR LULLA            Sania Mirza                                 
	Bangalore: Tennis sensation Sania Mirza seems to have sided with her career manager and opted out of the forthcoming Bangalore Open, a decision which she claimed was a result of the controversies she was courting.         
	Globosport, led by her mixed doubles partner Mahesh Bhupathi, is at loggerheads with the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association (KSLTA) after being shown the door from the prestigious WTA Tour event.         
	While Sania said her manager, Bhupathi, advised her against playing in India this year for the frequent controversies that she seemed to be getting into, the 10-time Grand Slam champion and the owner of Globosport seems to have effected a well directed snub to the Bangalore Open organisers by pulling Sania on to his side.         
	I think as an emerging player, Sania needs expert advice. All I can say is that she is not getting quality advice, KSLTA secretary Sundar Raju told The Telegraph.         
	Globosport and KSLTA have been at loggerheads for two years now on who should conduct the Bangalore Open. In the first edition, Globosport organised the event on behalf of KSLTA. We found them wanting in many areas. They failed to deliver. So we decided to manage it on our own, Raju said.         
	The third edition of the meet begins from March 3.         
	I dont really think Mahesh has given her good advice. As an emerging player she needs to listen to the right people, he said.         
	When contacted, Globosports representative said Raju was entitled to his opinion (on the wrong advice issue) but Sania had very valid reasons for opting out of playing in India.         
	Sania opted out because of the controversies and not because it was not a Mahesh Bhupathi tournament, the spokesperson said.         
	Raju clarified that he respected Bhupathi as a terrific player. But he did concede that earlier there had been an argument on who would conduct the tournament. I respect him as an individual and there are no problems between us, he added.         
	Asked if it was Bhupathis way of getting back at KSLTA by asking Sania to skip the Bangalore Open, Raju said: If thats the case, I think its a sad day for players. I wish they didnt mix business with sportsmanship.         
	Raju said Sania could have silenced her critics by letting her racket do the talking.         
	As an association, we are providing the platform. We too struggle to get top players to participate. Its very disappointing to not have your top local stars, especially as the home crowd would have made Sania push the bar especially against the William sisters. Does she not have an obligation towards her fans?         
	Sanias absence has not deterred the organisers. We are honoured that the William sisters  Serena and Venus  are both playing and its good for tennis in India and the future of the Bangalore Open. We are not losing any money or sponsorship owing to Sanias absence, another organiser said.

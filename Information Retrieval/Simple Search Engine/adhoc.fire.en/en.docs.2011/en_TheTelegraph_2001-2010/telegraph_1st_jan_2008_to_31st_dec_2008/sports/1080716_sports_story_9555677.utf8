	 Chelsea are interested in signing Real Madrids Brazilian forward Robinho  but have not offered 48m in a bid to bring him to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea have not made a 48m offer. Robinho is unhappy that Real have tried to use him in their attempt to sign Manchester Uniteds Cristiano Ronaldo.         
	72 hours to go         
	 Barcelona and Ronaldinho have given themselves 72 hours to decide upon the players future following a meeting at the Nou Camp on Monday, the Primera Liga club said. Ronaldinho and his brother and agent Roberto de Assis flew into the city on Monday to hold talks with Barcelona, with AC Milan and Manchester City the two clubs competing for the players services.         
	Lucre lure for Kaka         
	 Chelsea reputedly lodged an astronomical offer, believed to be 50 million, for Brazil star Kaka, which was promptly rejected, according to AC Milan, although Chelsea have since refuted the claims saying no such offer was ever made.         
	No contract         
	 Claude Makelele, the defensive midfielder, is considering a move to Paris Saint-Germain after being told he will not be offered a fresh one-year contract extension at Chelsea.         
	Scolaris demand         
	 Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe Scolari reportedly wants German Euro 2008 star Bastian Schweinsteiger at the London club this season. Schweinsteiger has apparently been targeted by Italian giants Juventus and Serie A champions Inter Milan, but Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is said to be preparing a 10million bid for the player.         
	Podolskis wish         
	 German striker Lukas Podolski is being linked with a move to Manchester City. It is expected that the Bayern Munich player would cost City in the region of 15million.         
	Spotlight on Senna         
	 Spains Euro 08 star Marcos Senna has become the latest name to be linked with Arsenal, although reports suggest the move is unlikely as Villarreal have slapped a 25m transfer tag on the midfielder, with Real Madrids Ruben de la Red becoming a more realistic option.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sourav is adjudged Indias top southpaw
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: A dozen years of run-making at crickets highest level has earned Sourav Ganguly the tag of the Best Left-handed Indian Batsman.         
	The honour was bestowed on the Prince of Calcutta, who will retire from international cricket after the ongoing Australia series, by the Legends Club of the Cricket Club of India, after a debate on Sourav and Indias Left-handers at the Clubs headquarters at the Brabourne Stadium on Sunday.         
	The Legends Club, a select group of former India cricketers and a few other members of the CCI, picked Ganguly from a shortlist of five, including Salim Durrani, Ajit Wadekar, Vinod Kambli and Yuvraj Singh.         
	The discussion was chaired by former India players Madahv Apte and Bapu Nadkarni. The batting skill of the players was the only criterion. Captaincy and bowling abilities were not taken into account.         
	Durrani, whom Nadkarni described as a wasted talent, and Yuvraj Singh and Kambli, due to their limited number of Test appearances, lagged behind Wadekar and Ganguly.         
	In the end, Gangulys runs and the number of matches played by him clinched the issue.

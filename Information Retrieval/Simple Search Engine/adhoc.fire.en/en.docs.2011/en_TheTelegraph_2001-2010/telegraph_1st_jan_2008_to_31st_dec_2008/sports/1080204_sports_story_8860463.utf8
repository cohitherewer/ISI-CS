                                                   Dhoni: Tie was evenly poised

 - I picked Tiwary on instinct, says captain 
   A CORRESPONDENT
              
	Brisbane: Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni defended the selection of Manoj Tiwary ahead of the more experienced Suresh Raina and Dinesh Karthik saying he went by his instincts. 
    
	Speaking to reporters after the opening game of the tri-series against Australia on Sunday was abandoned, the wicketkeeper-batsman said he picked Tiwary by instinct even though the Bengal youngster arrived in Australia only Saturday. He also outlined his vision for the 2011 World Cup saying, If we are looking for a team for the quadrennial meet, its important that we have guys who have played 80-100 ODIs by then...This is the team I wanted. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
    
	On his decision to bat first 
    
	It (the decision) was confusing. It was sticky and overcast and we expected it to swing. But it did not swing that much. We lost early wickets and Sachin Tendulkars dismissal was unfortunate. However, Gautam (Gambhir) and Rohit (Sharma) played really well. 
    
	On his thoughts about the match 
    
	The momentum was with us, though the game was evenly poised. The game could have gone either way. Our bowlers bowled well, they hit the right areas especially after the rain break, and found swing. Ishant (Sharma), as usual, was very good. 
    
	On his own innings 
    
	If I had got out cheaply, the side could have been bundled out for 150-160 runs. I see my position in the side as that of a floater. I can come low down the order and depending on the situation, you could also see me at number three. 
    
	On Tiwarys selection ahead of Raina and Karthik 
    
	I go by my instincts. I felt Manoj would do well. It was tough on him, it was his debut and he didnt have enough practice here. But that is international cricket, you have to adapt quickly at times. He was batting well and looking positive. Instinct is something you cant explain, like confidence and pressure. You feel it, you dont see it. We have to give players chances. I need to speak to him and find out about his mindset. He is a very talented batsman. 
    
	On the new look Indian team 
    
	The lack of familiarity of the Australians with India younger batsmen can work to our advantage, or backfire. It depends on the individuals, on how they take responsibility. They can either take up playing Australia and Sri Lanka as a challenge, or succumb. It is up to them to show courage and go out and perform, no matter how much we motivate them. 
    
	On his take on the younger lot 
    
	If we are looking for a team for 2011 World Cup, its important that we have guys who have played 80-100 ODIs by then... I think this is the team I wanted. Its very important to think about it from right now. As players, we all commit mistakes. Its about delaying those mistakes, and minimising them. Its about being open-minded. There are so many seniors in the side, people with 300-plus games, you must learn from them about preparation and adapting to tough situations. Its not just about practising and fitness. 
    
	On the loud jeering from the stands targeted at Harbhajan Singh 
    
	He was the lone wolf, he encouraged the whole stadium. Gilchrist and Sachin were applauded, but Harbhajan got them to sing and dance! It adds to the moment, I have no issues and he has no problem. I dont really care about the crowd so long as they dont come on to the field. And till the player gives 100 per cent on the field, I dont mind exchanges with the fans.

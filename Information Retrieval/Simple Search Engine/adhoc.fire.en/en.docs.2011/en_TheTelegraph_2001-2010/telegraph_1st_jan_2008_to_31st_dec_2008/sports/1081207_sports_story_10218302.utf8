	At Maheshtala         
	Hello, India. I didnt know I have so many fans here so far from my motherland. I didnt know the people of this country love the art called football so much. Im overwhelmed by these children. Their desire to play the game and to learn makes me happy. I couldnt have imagined that so many people of this country want to learn playing football. Argentina is very close to Fidel (Castro) and its the country of Che (Guevara). Ive brought all the love we have for you. Viva Calcutta, viva India               
	At Salt Lake Stadium         
	This is a great moment for me. Im sorry for not being able to talk to each of you separately. Im not feeling that Im not at home. This country is feeling like home. Ill never forget this visit. Ill never forget the love you have given me. I would like to thank the people who have brought me here and I would like to return here with my family

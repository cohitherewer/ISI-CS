                                                   Tsonga stole the limelight

                 
	The 2008 Australian Open was a landmark in Grand Slam history. The fortnight featured some of the best matches I had ever seen. The amazing power, accuracy and consistency, especially in the later matches, took the game to a higher level. 
    
	Twenty-year-old Novak Djokovic of Serbia, became the youngest ever to win the Australian Open, losing only one set on his way to the championship. Federer fell in the semi-finals, two steps away from his 13th Grand Slam title. It was sad to see him leave the Rod Laver Arena head bowed and crestfallen. 
    
	Djokovic won the title, but the brilliance of 22-year-old Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga stole the limelight. His infectious enthusiasm and buccaneering style lit up the fortnight as he ploughed his way through a fist full of seeds in the lower half of the draw  Andy Murray (9), Richard Gasquet (8), Mikhail Youzhny (14) and Rafael Nadal (2). It was a stunning and brilliant performance that captivated the world of tennis. 
    
	Djokovic, however, weathered Tsongas onslaught. He was like the sapling that bent backwards and survived the storm. The Serbs talent, resilience and resolve were honed to their sharpest in 2007, a year in which he fought his way into two Grand Slam semi-finals and the final of the US Open. He is now in full bloom. This year will be a big one for him. 
    
	Federers defeat also stunned the tennis world. His forehand, the spearhead of his attack, failed him for once. The viral attack before the tournament and the punishing match he won 10-8 in the fifth against stubborn never-say-die Serb Janko Tipsarevic in the round of 16 probably drained him. It was the longest fifth set in Federers career. Also, one must consider that Federer is now 26 years old with eight to 10 years of grinding tournament play behind him. Recovery time between matches will invariably slow down. 
    
	Nadals defeat at the hands of Tsonga was yet another major surprise. It was Tsongas finest hour. He overwhelmed Nadals spin with brute power, consistently hitting beyond the mercurial Spaniards reach and at times leaving him stranded yards behind the baseline with audacious, impossible drop volleys that barely bounced. It was a magical performance that had the old masters watching shaking their heads in disbelief. 
    
	Tsonga himself was so surprised by his form that he described his win over Nadal as ridiculous. Because of injuries, his game has not had the solid preparation and foundation that Djokovics game has and it may be difficult for him to maintain this level of play throughout 2008. 
    
	Seldom, if at all, can one find a world-class player who is running a successful business empire and at the same time playing at the top level of the game. Mahesh Bhupathi made light of all this and produced some scintillating tennis despite his recent back surgery, reaching the final of the mixed doubles with Sania Mirza and the semi-finals of the mens doubles with Mark Knowles of the Bahamas. 
    
	In the quarter-finals of the mens doubles the duo defeated the bouncing, chest-bumping Bryan brothers, the No. 1 seeds, in a superb match. Bhupathis backhand return, which he can hit flat or gently dip at the incoming servers feet is one of the best in the game. He has great tenacity and his powerful deep service is backed up by very good anticipation and reflexes. With 10 doubles Grand Slams titles in his kitty, Bhupathi is surely one of the greatest doubles players in the world. 
    
	The coming year promises to be an exciting year for mens tennis. One wonders if time will shuffle the pack or if Federer will successfully continue on his journey to tennis immortality.

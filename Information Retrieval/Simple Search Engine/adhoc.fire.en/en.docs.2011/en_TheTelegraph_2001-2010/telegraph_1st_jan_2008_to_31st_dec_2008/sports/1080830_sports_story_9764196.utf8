	Colombo: India suffered a humiliating 112-run loss against Sri Lanka in the rain-affected fifth and final one-dayer here on Friday. However, the visitors won the five-match series 3-2.         
	Chasing a revised target of 216 from 44 overs after the match was held up for 90 minutes due to rain, the visitors were skittled out for just 103 in 26.3 overs, after the hosts scored 227 for six in their 50 overs.         
	None of the Indian batsmen offered any resistance to Nuwan Kulasekara and Ajantha Mendis, who shared eight wickets between them.         
	Kulasekara ran through the Indian top order, claiming four for 40 from nine overs. He accounted for Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma.         
	Mendis claimed four for 10 from 4.3 overs.         
	The Indians began on a cautious note with openers Gambhir and Kohli scoring just three runs in three overs with the first and third overs, bowled by Kulasekara, being maiden overs.         
	But two fours by Gambhir off Thilan Thushara, and a huge six by Kohli off Kulasekara eased the pressure. India were 20 after the fifth over and the run rate of four was maintained till Gambhir was out off the last ball of the ninth over. He nicked a Kulasekara delivery, playing away from his body, and Kumar Sangakkara did the rest behind the stumps.         
	Kohli paid the price for playing across as he was trapped in front of the stumps nine balls after Gambhirs departure. However, he made a useful 31 off 46 balls.         
	India were in a spot of bother at 45 for two, but Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina began repairing the innings with some lusty blows.         
	Raina, however, was guilty of getting out with a poor shot. The Uttar Pradesh youngster tried to pull a not-so-short delivery and holed out at mid-off to Dilhara Fernando.         
	Rohit Sharma, who came after the 90-minute rain intervention, did not last long and was out lbw to Kulasekara for three. He was unlucky to be given out as the ball hit him outside the line of off stump.         
	Nine balls later, Ajantha Medis claimed Yuvrajs wicket off his first ball, which hit the stumps after an inside edge. That dismissal reduced India to 79 for five.         
	Hopes of a fightback went up in smoke after Dhoni lost his stumps to Dilhara in the 20th over.         
	Pathan, Zaheer Khan, R.P. Singh and Pragyan Ojha did not last long.         
	Earlier, unbeaten knocks by Thushara and Jehan Mubarak helped Sri Lanka reach 227 for six.         
	They were gasping for breath at 133 for six when the two joined hands and mauled the Indian attack with an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 78 balls.         
	The home side received a jolt in the second over when Jayasuriya perished..         
	Malinda Warnapura and Mahela Udawatte then tried hard to consolidate, but runs were hard to come by. In fact, the first 10 overs produced only 28 runs.         
	Warnapura was lucky to be dropped by Rohit at cover point, while Udawatte gained in confidence by smashing Zaheer for four.         
	The Indians got the breakthrough when Irfan Pathan induced a top edge from Warnapura. The Baroda bowlers next victim was Udawatte. R.P. Singh then joined the party with Sangakkaras wicket.         
	Jayawardene got a life of sorts as Pragyan almost caught him off his own bowling, but the Lankan skipper could not make the most of it as the Indian spinner had the last laugh.         
	Chamara Kapugedera and Mubarak then took Sri Lanka to 126 for five in 35 overs. Kapugederas innings came to an end in the 37th over.         
	Sri Lanka averaged less than four even after 40 overs, but Thusharas big hits took them to a respectable total. Mubarak, on a comeback trail, also chipped in with the odd boundary.

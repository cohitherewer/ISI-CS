The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle considers stepping down
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gayle considers stepping down
                  Chris Gayle                     
	Port of Spain: Apparently unhappy with the West Indies Cricket Boards (WICB) selection policy of experimenting with young blood in the recent series against Australia, Chris Gayle is considering to step down as West Indies captain. WICB chief executive Donald Peters said he was aware of Gayles intention to step down from captaincy though the board is yet to receive an official word from the flamboyant opener.         
	I am aware he (Gayle) is considering not making himself available for the captaincy, Peters told a daily here.         
	If Gayle decides to step down, West Indies will have to appoint a new captain for the Champions Trophy in Pakistan in September. Gayle had questioned the selection of several youngsters for the last two matches of the home ODI series Down Under, which they lost 0-5. The Caribbeans also lost the three-Test series 0-2.         
	Gayle has had mixed results as captain, winning two Tests out of five and seven ODIs out of 17. He led the Windies to two series wins in ODIs, including a victory against England last year, and against the touring Lankans recently.           (PTI)

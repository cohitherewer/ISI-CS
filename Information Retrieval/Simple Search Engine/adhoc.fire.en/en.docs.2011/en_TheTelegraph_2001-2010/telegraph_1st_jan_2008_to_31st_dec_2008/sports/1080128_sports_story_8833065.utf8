                                                AIFF make adjustments
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: All state leagues, except in Calcutta, will be played simultaneously with the I-League between September and March from the next season.         
	The Calcutta Football League will also have to fall in line and follow the pattern with the rest of the country from the 2009-10 season.         
	The AIFF core committee has also made a recommendation to play the I-League matches only on Saturdays and Sundays. The state league matches would be played in the midweek, preferably on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

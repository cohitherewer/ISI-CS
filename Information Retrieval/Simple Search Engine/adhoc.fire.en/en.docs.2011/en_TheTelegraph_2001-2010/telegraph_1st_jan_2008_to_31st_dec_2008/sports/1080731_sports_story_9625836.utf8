The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its a fair result: Houghton
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Its a fair result: Houghton
                      
	Hyderabad: India coach Bob Houghton sought to defend his teams lack lustre performance against Afghanistan, saying the 1-0 win was a fair result against an under-rated team in their first match of the AFC Challenge Cup on Wednesday.         
	Climax Lawrence saved the day for India scoring in the injury time (92nd minute) of the match but the home team failed to live up to the expectations preceding the tournament.         
	The resistance from their opponents, the lowest ranked side in the tournament at 181st in latest Fifa charts, left the Indians red-faced but Houghton would have none of it.         
	I dont think that Fifa rankings reflect the strength of the Afghan team. They are a much better team than the rankings indicate, so it is no shame that we won by 1-0 margin, he said at the post-match press conference.         
	Houghton refused to say that Indias next opponents, defending champions Tajikistan and Turkmenistan could be tougher opponents than the Afghans.         
	I cant say whether Tajikistan or Turkmenistan were better sides than the Afghans. Players from Afghanistan have moved out of the country to play outside, so they are an up and coming country, said Houghton, who watched the Tajikistan versus Turkmenistan match which ended in a goalless draw earlier in the day. He compared todays result with that against Bangladesh in the Nehru Cup last year in New Delhi.         
	We beat Bangladesh 1-0 in the group stage of the Nehru Cup and we won the tournament, so the 1-0 scoreline today was a good result, the 60-year-old Englishman added.         
	Afghan coach Yousuf Kargar was a happy man despite the loss against fancied India.           (PTI)

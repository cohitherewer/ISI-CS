                                                VRV Singh arrives
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sydney: Zaheer Khans replacement, Vikram Rajvir Singh, arrived here (via Singapore) late on Saturday.         
	Im happy to be back in the squad... My priority is to quickly settle down, the new-ball bowler told The Telegraph.         
	The last time that Singh was in the Team India dressing room was during the Bangalore Test against Pakistan.         
	Meanwhile, the two-day tour match in Canberra will probably be back to being a three-day affair. Again, this request has been made by Anil Kumble amp; Co.

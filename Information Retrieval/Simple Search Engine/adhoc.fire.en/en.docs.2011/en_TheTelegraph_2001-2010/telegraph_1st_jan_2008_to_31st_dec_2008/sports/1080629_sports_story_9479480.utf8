	Wimbledon: No slow start for Venus Williams this time.         
	After struggling in tight first sets in her opening two matches, the defending champion moved quickly to defeat Spanish qualifier Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez 6-1, 7-5 on Saturday and advance to the fourth round at Wimbledon.         
	Williams served out the match at love, finishing with a 127-mph delivery  the fastest recorded by a woman at Wimbledon  for her 11th ace.         
	Yeah, 127 is a good way to end it, said Williams, who holds the WTA Tour record at 129 mph.         
	The four-time champion was barely tested in the first set by the 101st-ranked player. But Williams was pushed to the limit in the second when Martinez Sanchez switched to an effective serve-and-volley game.         
	Also advancing to the round of 16 was No. 2-seeded Jelena Jankovic, who rallied after dropping the first set and overcame a knee injury to down 17-year-old Danish player Caroline Wozniacki 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 on Centre Court. Jankovic appeared to hyperextend her left knee while lunging for a shot in the first set and later took an injury timeout to get her knee heavily wrapped.         
	Jankovic plans to have an MRI before facing Tamarine Tanasugarn in the fourth round on Monday.         
	Williams will next face 18-year-old Russian Alisa Kleybanova, who is into the second week in her Wimbledon debut after defeating Ai Sugiyama 6-4, 6-4.         
	Jankovic is the highest-ranked player left in the womens draw after the upsets of No. 1 Ana Ivanovic and No. 3 Maria Sharapova. For a while on Saturday, she looked in danger of joining them to make it the first time in the Open era that the top three seeded women failed to make the fourth round at a Grand Slam.         
	Jankovic limped through the third set, but still dropped only two games to close out the match as Wozniacki committed unforced errors on key points.         
	French Open runner-up Dinara Safina, seeded No. 9, struggled with a thigh injury and fell to Israels Shahar Peer 7-5, 6-7 (4), 8-6 in a 3 hour, 25-minute battle.         
	Other women advancing to the round of 16 on Saturday were fifth-seeded Elena Dementieva, No. 21 Nadia Petrova and 154th-ranked Alla Kudryavtseva.         
	Mens winners included No. 8 Richard Gasquet, No. 12 Andy Murray, Janko Tipsarevic, Arnaud Clement and Rainer Schuettler. Murray, carrying Britains perennial hopes for a first home-grown male champion since 1936, served 15 aces in a 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-2 win over Tommy Haas.

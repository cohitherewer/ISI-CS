	New Delhi: His fourth top 10 finish of the season at the European Open notwithstanding, Jeev Milkha Singh slipped a rung to 79th, while Jyoti Randhawa lost seven places to be 88th in the latest golf rankings.         
	Jeev, who signed off tied 10th after his worst card of the week at Ash, England, remains the highest ranked Indian with Randhawa, who missed the cut in the European Open, the lone other Indian in the top 100 list.         
	Third Indian on the chart is US-based Arjun Atwal (189) who is playing on the Nationwide Tour to retain his PGA Tour card.         
	Indian Masters winner S.S.P. Chowrasia, who failed to make the cut in the European Open, is placed 211th.           (PTI)

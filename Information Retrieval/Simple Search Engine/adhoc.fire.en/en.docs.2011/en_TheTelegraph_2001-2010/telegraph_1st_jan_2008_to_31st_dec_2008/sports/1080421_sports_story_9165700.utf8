                                                                                                                                                                                                     Warne slams ECB policy
            League Snippets                
	 New Delhi: Spin legend Shane Warne has slammed the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for not allowing centrally contracted players to turn out in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Dimitri Mascarenhas is the only England player in the cash-rich IPL. He is not an ECB-contracted player and has signed up for Rajasthan Royals, captained by former Hampshire skipper Warne. The retired leg-spinner said the presence of England players in the IPL would only benefit the game. The IPL is a great idea. Cricketers from diverse cultures come and share the experience. This has been going on in England for quite a long time., Warne said.                 
	Pak players rsquo; routine  
	Karachi: Pakistan players taking part in the IPL have been given special programmes by the national team trainer to ensure they dont face burn out before the start of the next international season, Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik has said. Twenty20 cricket is very demanding but I think there is enough breathing space in between the IPL matches We have also been given special fitness programs by David Dwyer, Malik said.    
	Majola rsquo;s wish  
	Mumbai: Cricket South Africa (CSA) has rallied strongly behind Indian counterpart BCCI and asked the ICC for a six-week window in April-May to accommodate the IPL. I believe, however, that it is vital that the ICC creates a six-week window in the international programme each year for the IPL so that it does not encroach on any international tours, Gerald Majola, CEO of CSA, said in a release. In this way, there can be no conflict between national playing contracts and those of the tournament. An ideal time would be the last two weeks in April and the month of May, he said.    
	Munaf rsquo;s views  
	Jaipur: Rajasthan Royals Munaf Patel on Sunday said it was wrong to put the underdog tag on his team after they went down meekly to the Delhi DareDevils. Though we dont have big names except Warne we are not under pressure and neither are we underdogs., Munaf said.

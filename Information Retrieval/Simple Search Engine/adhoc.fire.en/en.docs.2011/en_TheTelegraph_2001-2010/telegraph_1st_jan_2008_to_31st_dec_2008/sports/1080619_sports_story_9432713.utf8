	Birmingham: The second limited-overs International between England and New Zealand was abandoned because of persistent rain on Wednesday and declared a no result.         
	New Zealand only needed to face six more balls to have the match at Edgbaston count, but the umpires waved the players off with the Black Caps on 127-2 after 19 overs and the covers were brought on.         
	Under the revised target using the Duckworth-Lewis system to determine rain-reduced matches, New Zealand only needed to reach 134 for two in 20 overs to win.         
	Earlier, England were 162 all out after being sent into bat by New Zealand after a four-hour-and-15 minute rain delay. The innings was originally reduced to 29, but that was lowered to 24 after a rain delay mid-innings.         
	Players took a 30 minute break between innings and New Zealands revised target, using the Duckworth-Lewis method, was 165.         
	Luke Wright scored 52 from 38 balls, including two sixes and four boundaries and England captain Paul Collingwood also boosted the score with 37. Geoff Elliott took three for 23 on his New Zealand ODI debut and Tim Southee had two wickets in two balls in the final over to finish with two for 35. Under overcast skies, blustery conditions blew a bail off at the non-strikers end as Kyle Mills strode in to deliver the first ball.         
	Kevin Pietersen only lasted 20 balls and 13 runs when Vettori caught his attempted drive off the bowling of Michael Mason.         
	In reply, New Zealand opener Jamie How tried to clip a shot from Stuart Broad to the leg side, but it went straight to Shah at short mid-wicket for 16. Ross Taylor then put on 54 runs with Brendon McCullum before he was caught by Collingwood at mid-wicket.

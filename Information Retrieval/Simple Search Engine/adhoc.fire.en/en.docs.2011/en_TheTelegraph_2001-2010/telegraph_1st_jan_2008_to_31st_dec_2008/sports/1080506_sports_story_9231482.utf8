The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB chief drops suit
                                                                                                                                                                                           PCB chief drops suit
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Nasim Ashraf on Monday withdrew his Rs 220 million defamation suit against fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar after a top government official mediated a reconciliation between them.         
	The meeting, which took place in Islamabad on Sunday night, was brokered by Rehman Malik, a top man in the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party and advisor to the prime minister on interior affairs.         
	Both Shoaib and Ashraf were present in the meeting.         
	Tafazzul Rizvi, the lawyer who filed the defamation suit in the civil court on behalf of Ashraf, said Shoaib had shown remorse for his remarks and behaviour and asked for forgiveness.         
	The lawsuit was filed in a Lahore court and was to come up for hearing on May 16.         
	Shoaib apologised to Nasim Ashraf in person and accepted that he had levelled false and baseless allegations against him in the meeting, Rizvi said.         
	The PCB chief had filed the defamation suit against Shoaib after the fast bowler alleged on a television show that he (Ashraf) had demanded money from him and other players for signing IPL contracts.         
	Ashraf has decided not to pursue the defamation suit against the pacer and it will be withdrawn since his honour and dignity stand vindicated, Rizvi said. (PTI)

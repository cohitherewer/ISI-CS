                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jhulan Goswami joins 100-wicket club

	Colombo: Jhulan Goswami added another feather to her cap by becoming the fourth bowler in the history of womens cricket to take 100 ODI wickets as India defeated Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the penultimate round match of the Asia Cup Thursday.         
	Jhulan completed the century of wickets in her 82nd ODI when she had Sri Lankas last batter Deepika Rasangika caught by Asha Rawat on the second last delivery of home teams quota of 50 overs. Sri Lanka were restricted to 123 for nine.         
	Asha and captain Mithali Raj then put on 84 runs for the unbroken third wicket partnership as India achieved victory for the loss of two wickets in 26 overs. Asha remained unbeaten on 56 that came off 71 balls and included eight fours and one six while Mithali hit five fours in her 44-ball 36.         
	The day, however, belonged to Jhulan who won the ICC Womens Cricketer of the year award at the ICC awards in Johannesburg in September last year.         
	Jhulan had entered the tournament with 96 wickets against her name and came into this match requiring two wickets to join Neetu David as the second India bowler to achieve the rare feat.         
	She claimed the wicket of Chamari Polgampola with her eighth delivery of the match but then had to bowl 51 more deliveries to pick the elusive wicket.         
	Australias Cathryn Fitzpatrick, who took 180 in her illustrious 14-year career, leads the list of most successful bowlers, followed by Neetu (135) and Clare Taylor of England (102).         
	Elsewhere, off-spinner Javeria Khan recorded stunning figures of 8.1-4-8-6 as Pakistan defeated Bangladesh by 38 runs to end its 12-match losing streak in the history of this tournament.

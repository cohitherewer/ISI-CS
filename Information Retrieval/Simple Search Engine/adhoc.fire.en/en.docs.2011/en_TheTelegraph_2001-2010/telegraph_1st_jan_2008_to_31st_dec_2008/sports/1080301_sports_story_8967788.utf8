                                                     Proteas ground Bangla to dust on Day I
                  Neil McKenzie and Graeme Smith at the end of Day I in Chittagong on Friday                     
	Chittagong: Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie put on a record opening stand as South Africa seized complete control of the second Test against Bangladesh on the opening day here on Friday.         
	The South Africa captain batted superbly for his unbeaten 223, his fourth double century in Tests while McKenzie impressed with a career-best 169.         
	Their stand was the best ever for the opening wicket for South Africa, surpassing the 368-run partnership between Smith and Herschelle Gibbs against Pakistan in Cape Town in 2003. Indias Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy hold the world record opening stand of 413.         
	At close, South Africa were cruising at 405 without loss on a placid track at the Chittagong Divisional Stadium.         
	Smith pounded the home sides bowlers, striking 31 fours and a six, while McKenzie hit 20 fours and two sixes to cap a miserable day for the hosts. The aggressive left-handed captain, who reached his 200 with a cracking four past mid-wicket, also became the first South African to notch up four double hundreds. Gary Kirsten scored three.         
	On a day of milestones, Smith also passed 5,000 runs in Tests, the fourth South African to do so.         
	This was his second double century against Bangladesh after reaching the mark in 2002 in East London.         
	McKenzie reached his third Test century and first in seven years in style, dancing down the pitch to retiring left-arm spinner Mohammed Rafique for a straight six over long-on.         
	The Bangladesh bowlers toiled through the day without luck, with the pacemen erring in line too often and the spinners unable to extract any sort of turn from the placid track.         
	Smith started off tentatively but opened up to play some enthralling cover drives.         
	McKenzie, who offered solid support to his skipper from the other end, was dropped on 131 when Rafique failed to latch on to a tough chance off his own bowling.         
	Smith was leading the side in a national record 54th Test, surpassing the mark of the late Hansie Cronje. He made his debut as Test captain in 2003.           (AFP)

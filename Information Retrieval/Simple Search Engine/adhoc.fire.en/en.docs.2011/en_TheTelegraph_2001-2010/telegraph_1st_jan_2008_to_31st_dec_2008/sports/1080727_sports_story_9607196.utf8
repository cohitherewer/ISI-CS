            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Parthiv Patel                           
	Colombo: Parthiv Patel, Team Indias No.2 wicketkeeper on the tour, was both relieved and sad when contacted by The Telegraph on Saturday evening.         
	Nobody in my family has been affected, but its shocking that serial blasts have taken place in Ahmedabad, he said.         
	Parthiv is, of course, the only Indian player based in Ahmedabad.

                                                   Mahela wary of energetic India
            A CORRESPONDENT                                Mahela Jayawardene       
	Canberra: Australia are no more dominating in one-day cricket and they are no longer unbeatable, said Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene Monday.         
	After thrashing Sri Lanka by 128 runs in Sydney, Australia faced a five-wicket loss to India on Sunday.   
	Speaking to reporters on the eve of their tri-series match against India, Jayawardene said Indias upset win over Australia had not only opened up the competition but provided another example of the chinks in the armour of Ricky Pontings on and off side.  
	The following are excerpts  
	On Indias stunning win over Australia  
	They bowled really well up front to put pressure on the Aussies and batted well under tough conditions. Australia are not dominating world cricket at the moment hellip;they are playing some good cricket but on and off. I think the rest of the world is catching up to them, especially in one-day cricket.  
	On Indias bowling attack  
	They have been bowling really well in the past few weeks. In the Tests, they showed good form. We just need to make sure that we try to combat that. In a one-day game you need to perform on that particular day. Otherwise, you can be beaten. We just need to come back strong.  
	On Indias youthful side  
	India have brought in two younger guys (Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma). There is a lot of energy in that team. The duo have to be consistent over a period of time. They are playing some very good cricket, no doubt. But thats a good opportunity for us to challenge ourselves and see where we are.  
	On their loss to Australia  
	Our batting is a bit of concern. You can have those kinds of days. That happened to the Aussies Sunday. They couldnt even get 160 with seven batsmen. We just need to forget about what happened the other day and come back strongly.   
	On their prospects in the tri-series  
	The competition is quite open now. If we can get a win tomorrow, everyone will have one win each. Here, the wicket looks a bit brown, rolled in. It looks very hard so it should be a good one-day track. We think we can win the next four or five games in a row and make the final.  
	On Tillekeratne Dilshans knee  
	He has a bit of an infection. Hopefully, he should be fine.

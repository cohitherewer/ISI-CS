The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods is back, as caddie
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Woods is back, as caddie
                  Tiger Woods                     
	San Diego: Four months after his epic US Open victory, Tiger Woods returned to Torrey Pines without a limp, and without his golf clubs.         
	Out of action since beating Rocco Mediate in a 19-hole playoff for his 14th career major, Woods came back to Torrey Pines on Monday to caddy for the winner of the Tee Off with Tiger online competition.         
	Hopping from a golf cart, Woods walked up to 59-year-old John Abel, doffed his cap and extended his right hand. I hear youre looking for a caddie. Im Tiger Woods  pleased to meet you.         
	Showing no signs of his season-ending knee surgery a week after the US Open, Woods wore a green caddies bib inscribed with Abels name as he guided him around the back nine of the South Course, where he has won six times in the Buick Invitational and once in a US Open he called his best ever.         
	Playing with torn ligaments in his left knee and a double stress fracture in his leg, Woods made a 12-foot birdie on the final hole to force an 18-hole playoff, made a 4-foot birdie on the 18th in the playoff to stay alive and finally won with a par.         
	I opened the curtains and saw the 18th green, Woods said. I was like, You know what? That is pretty cool. A different atmosphere. You can actually see. They dont have the grandstands in the way. I saw where the pin was and was thinking, You know what? I remember that putt.         
	Woods was in character from the minute he drove up to the 10th tee, on cue from a video crew that recorded every one of Abels shots. Reporters and photographers from two media outlets were allowed to watch on the 10th and 18th holes.         
	Woods drove the cart. He handed clubs to Abel, then wiped them off with a towel and put them back in the bag. He squatted to line up putts and tended the pin. He warned how fast the greens were, then chuckled as Abel five-putted the 10th for a quadruple-bogey 8.         
	Woods gave the best local advice anyone could ever hope to get on the tough course on the bluffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean.         
	It was fun, said Woods, who once caddied for former Stanford teammate Jerry Chang. This was totally cool. Ive caddied before many times. For me to be out here and to be able to do it again, its always fun. Johns a good guy. It was a fun day for me.         
	Abel, from West Berlin, New Jersey, said his round went better than expected.         
	I wasnt as nervous after maybe the third or fourth hole, he said. Nerves come into it, I dont care who you are, and these greens are unbelievable. Tiger was telling me that theyre actually 3 feet slower than what they played for the Open.         
	It was just such a hoot to play with him, said Abel, who regularly shoots in the 90s. He showed me things I never even thought about. Like when he walks into a sand trap, he feels with his feet. It was just so neat It really was.         
	As for his caddie skills, It was all good, man, joked Woods, who enjoyed seeing Abel make a 20-foot uphill par putt on 17.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clark strikes early blows
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Clark strikes early blows
                      
	Kingston: West Indies trailed Australia by 316 runs with seven first-innings wickets remaining after seamer Stuart Clark claimed the hosts top three batsmen on Day II of the first Test on Friday.         
	Clarks excellent spell of three for 18, including the prize wicket of captain Ramnaresh Sarwan, left the hosts struggling on 115 for three chasing Australias total of 431.         
	Runako Morton (23) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (25) saw West Indies through to stumps after they had struggled to 68 for three following a positive day with the ball.         
	Clark bowled Devon Smith, after the West Indies opener made a bright 32, and provided debutant wicketkeeper Brad Haddin with his first Test victim when he snapped up Sarwan who had flashed outside off-stump.         
	Clark caused further damage with a beautiful delivery moving away from Brenton Parchment, who scored just nine off 60 balls.         
	Morton and Chanderpaul got their heads down, though, and battled through to stumps but Clark said the Australians were happy.           (REUTERS)

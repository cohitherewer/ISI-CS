            A STAFF REPORTER            Ismail Addo                           
	Calcutta: City giants East Bengal will be eyeing full points when they face last years runners-up Churchill Brothers in their Round XI ONGC I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday.         
	Churchill Brothers, on the other hand ,will leave no stone unturned in shortening the gap between them and Mohun Bagan, who are now placed second on 21 points from 11 matches.         
	Churchill are now on 17 points and a win against East Bengal will take them one spot below Mohun Bagan.         
	While Churchill will look forward to grabbing the opportunities with marksman Odafe Onkeya Okolie upfront, East Bengal are likely to field their new Ghanaian recruit Ismail Addo in place of the Brazilian striker Edmilson Marques.         
	Churchill, however, will miss the services of Felix Chimaokwu (double booking) and Ogba Kalu Nnanna (groin injury). Coach Zoran Djordjevic after Sundays practice session said: East Bengal are a very good side. They will have home advantage But we will play for a win It will be a cautious approach and my boys will do everything for the win.         
	For East Bengal coach Stanley Rozario, however, things seem to be a bit difficult. With uncertainty looming large over the availability of Suley Musah, Surkumar Singh, Khelemba Singh and Nirmal Chetri  all down with injuries  Stanley will rely heavily on Sunil Chetri, Parveen Kumar, Yusif Yakubu against Churchill.         
	East Bengal, with 12 points from 10 matches, lie seventh.

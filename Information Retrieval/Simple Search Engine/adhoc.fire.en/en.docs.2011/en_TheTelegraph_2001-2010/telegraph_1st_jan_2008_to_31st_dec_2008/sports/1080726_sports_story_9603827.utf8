	ANECDOTE  
	Double nationality         
	Angelo Parisi had the peculiar honour of winning four Olympic medals between 1972 and 1984 while holding two different passports. Born in Italy but raised in London he won the bronze medal in the all categories for Britain in 1972. He then met and married a Frenchwoman, allowing him to obtain French nationality. Competing under the tricolour he became the first French Olympic judo champion, in the heavyweight division, and added a silver medal to his tally in the all categories division. In 1984, he won another silver, this time as a heavyweight.         
	EXPLOIT         
	Prior to the 1980 Games in Moscow a sensation had been caused when Nadia Comaneci became the first gymnast to be awarded a perfect ten in an Olympic event, namely the asymmetrical bars. Yet, it was only a matter of time before that honour would be conferred upon a male gymnast of similar calibre.         
	In Moscow, he showed up in the shape of the Soviet Unions 22-year-old Alexander Dityatin (long horse vault  all around competition). At last, the Soviets, who had played decisive roles in the development of Olympic, and indeed, world gymnastics, were awarded their perfect ten. The Leningrad-born gymnast would also walk away with numerous medals.         
	SUMMARY         
	While chosen to host the 1980 Olympic Games on October 23, 1974, the IOC was all too aware of the difficulties that such a choice may incur. The Olympic movement still fell prey to politics when the Games were held in Moscow, the first Eastern European city to host the Games. The boycott became apparent once more with the absence of the United States and many other countries.         
	The Soviet capital had been preparing for five years to stage the event, with Communism being assured its own quota of publicity. New stadia and sports facilities were built and those that already existed, such as the Lenin stadium, were modernised. But the same effort was applied, to the detriment of the public, outside the city. A five-storey mausoleum, used as a media centre, was erected on a site where fifty individual houses had previously stood. The domes on top of the Kremlin and many of the areas churches were totally restored.         
	Given the absence of notable competitors, above all the Americans, the competitions failed to capture the true spirit of the Games - despite the breaking of 36 world records.         
	When the final curtain fell, the overall opinion was that the Games had been mediocre. On the one hand, the American boycott more or less biased the competition, as well as provoking a dull atmosphere.         
	On the other hand, the competitors had reason, on a regular basis, to complain about certain irregularities. Favours given to the Soviet team, or advice given to local athletes, lent an unhealthy pallor to the moral and sporting appearance of the Games.

	Berlin: World No. 2 Ana Ivanovic suffered a surprise 6-2, 7-5 defeat by Elena Dementieva in the semi-finals of the German Open on Saturday. The 20-year-old Serbian, the title holder in Berlin, made far too many unforced errors and was broken five times by the Russian seventh seed.         
	Dementieva will play compatriot Dinara Safina in Sundays final. The 13th seed, who has beaten world No. 1 Justine Henin and eight-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams this week, defeated unseeded Belarussian teenager Victoria Azarenka 6-4, 6-1 in the first semi-final.         
	A former finalist at both the French and US Opens, Dementieva had won all three previous matches against Ivanovic but they had never met on clay. (Reuters)

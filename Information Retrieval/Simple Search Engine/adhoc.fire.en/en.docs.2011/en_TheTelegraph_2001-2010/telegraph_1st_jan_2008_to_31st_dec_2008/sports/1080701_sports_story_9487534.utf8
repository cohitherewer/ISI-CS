The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Id been backing Germany: Yuvi
                                                                                                                                                                                             Id been backing Germany: Yuvi
  - Presenting MoM award an unforgettable experience for India vice-captain       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Yuvraj Singh hands over the MoM trophy to Swiss forward Hakan Yakin                                 
	Karachi: There was an Indian presence, actually quite high profile at that, in one match of the just-ended Euro competition. One is, of course, talking of Team Indias ODI vice-captain Yuvraj Singh.         
	Yuvraj, it may be recalled, made the MoM presentation after the June 15 Portugal versus Switzerland face-off in Basel. The experience of watching that match in person is something he wont forget in a hurry.         
	On Monday afternoon, at the Pearl Continental here, Yuvraj took a few questions from The Telegraph on Euro 08.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Spain becoming the best in Europe after 44 years         
	Good for them... With Portugal out of the race, Id been backing Germany... It really didnt matter that the Germans had sent Portugal packing (in the quarters)... In fact, Id watched the thrilling Germany versus Turkey semi-final the other night... It had such a rousing finish (Germany winning with seconds remaining).         
	Whether he watched Sunday nights final         
	Unfortunately, no... I got the dates mixed up and, for some reason, it was in my mind that the final was tonight... (Adds laughing) Just goes to show what too much cricket can do.         
	His fascination for Portugal         
	Because their game has the Latin American touch... Has that flair which appeals... Its exciting soccer... Their approach is different.         
	Not getting to meet Cristiano Ronaldo when he went to Basel         
	It was disappointing... He was rested that day and Portugal lost the match... Given the result, I didnt ask for a one-on-one with him... Id assumed the team would be upset... Hes one of my favourites, with a remarkably high level of skill.         
	Whether he was surprised on being invited to make the presentation         
	Well, they (Carlsberg) wanted an Indian sportsman and I felt honoured... I couldnt have gone had the tri-series final gone to the reserve day... Getting to Basel had been one hell of a journey  Dhaka to Kuwait City to Frankfurt to Zurich (where his bag didnt arrive) and, from there, by road... The hour-long drive, though, was beautiful.         
	MoM Hakan Yakins reaction on getting the award from him         
	(Grins) It was an awkward moment for both of us... A bit funny too... I dont think the Swiss striker said much, probably because he wasnt fluent in English... As for me, I didnt say much either... Congratulated him, thats it... I guess most there must have wondered who I was... Some could even have thought I was from outer space!         
	The experience of watching an Euro match live         
	It was great... Absolutely great... The whole presentation, so to say, was very different from the way we do it... There was professionalism every inch of the way... Then, viewing a match in person is different from watching it on the TV... On the TV, one gets the impression that the players have much space, not so while viewing live... Everything appeared condensed... The 90 minutes went in a flash... It was a new experience for me. Id been tired because of the travelling, but it was worth it.         
	Crowd behaviour         
	It was known that Switzerland wouldnt qualify for the next stage (quarters), yet it was a full house and the way the fans still supported their team was touching.         
	The Euro match which fascinated him         
	I couldnt, obviously, watch all... The Germany-Turkey semi-final was memorable... That it got decided in the last minute (via a Philipp Lahm goal) tells its own story.         
	Whether he follows soccer in India         
	Im aware of the teams and so on, but I dont really follow it...         
	On being a passionate Manchester United fan         
	Absolutely... I try to watch as many English Premier League matches as possible and, boy, theres always a distinct buzz around Man United... Its special.         
	Finally, his favourite team  be it country or club         
	Brazil.

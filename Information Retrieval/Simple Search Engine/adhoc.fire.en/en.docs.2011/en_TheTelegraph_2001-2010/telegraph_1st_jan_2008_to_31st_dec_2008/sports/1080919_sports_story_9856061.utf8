The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo returns amid applause at Old Trafford
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ronaldo returns amid applause at Old Trafford

	There would have been times when Cristiano Ronaldo must have wondered whether he would ever see Old Trafford again as a Manchester United player. There are, sadly, too many times in which footballers have their quotes taken out of context by journalists seeking a quick fix but there were too many occasions in which Ronaldo had told interviewers: You know what my dream is, for that ever to be credible in his case. He yearned for Real Madrid.         
	And yet he has done too much not to be forgiven. When at 9.05 pm last night (GMT) he stood bouncing on his heels, 74,000 stood to applaud. His warm-ups along the touchline wearing green boots were also greeted by ovation that was almost ordained. When receiving the Ballon DOr on his home island of Madeira, Ronaldo was asked what sort of reception he expected on his return and he replied: They will, of course, love me.         
	Of course they did, 42 goals in a single season buys you some love. Eventually, he will wear the white of Madrid but not this season. Though he is a supreme professional, Ronaldo is not a man graced by modesty and you imagine there is something in his make-up that would not have minded that United had struggled in his absence.         
	In the moments when he was waiting to make his entrance, Villarreal had struck the post and a radically-altered United side appeared as bankrupt of ideas as they had the last time these sides had met in 2005. Then they had finished humiliatingly bottom of their group mainly because of an inability to find the net.         
	This season the infection has returned, although the moment Ronaldo stepped on to the pitch, the familiar passing routines that took in Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez began to appear. And the songs about him that had been such a feature of a season that had ended in rain and silverware in Moscow were chanted once more.         
	In a perfect world, Ronaldo would have headed Nanis cross into the corner of the net below the Stretford End. Perfection, however, proved elusive, although had Jonny Evans, a wonderfully-talented centre-half who has preferred to take his chances at Old Trafford rather than accept a guaranteed position at Sunderland, not struck the post, there would have been a story. The cross was Ronaldos.         
	He made his entrance into a much-changed side. Gary Neville once remarked that Sir Alex Ferguson completely loses his temper in the dressing-room perhaps three or four times a season. A glance at the team sheet suggested that Anfield last Saturday had been one such occasion. The side that had committed the unforgivable crime of showing a lack of desire against Liverpool was gutted. When Manchester United ran out to begin their defence of the European Cup, there were six absentees from the team that had failed Ferguson so miserably on Merseyside  a reminder that the ruthless surveying of his own squad for weaknesses would not cease.

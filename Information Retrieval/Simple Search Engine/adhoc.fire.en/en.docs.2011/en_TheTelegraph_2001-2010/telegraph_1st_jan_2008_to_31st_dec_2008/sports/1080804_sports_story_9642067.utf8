The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sikdar keeps up golden run
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sikdar keeps up golden run
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The third day of the 58th State Athletic meet was marred by rain and a lack of any record breaking performance. Bursts of rain at the Salt Lake Stadium delayed proceedings and the lack of spectators failed to inspire the athletes.         
	Among the track and field events, the Police Athletic Club won gold in the coveted 4x100m mens relay, beating West Bengal Police SC.         
	In the girls under-16 category, Kalyani Sikdar continued her golden run, inspiring Uttar Dinajpur DSA to a victory in the medley relay. The girl from Uttar Dinajpur had won golds in the 200m and the 400m sprint races on Saturday.         
	Later, Sikdar was on trackside, cheering cousin Sipra Sarkar who won the under-16 girls 3000m race also representing Uttar Dinajpur DSA.         
	National record holder in the under-18 and the under-20 800m category, Jhuma Khatun won the 800m womens run but failed to come close to Jyotirmoyee Sikdars meet record of 2:05.1 seconds.         
	Nikhil Roy of West Bengal Police SC won the mens long jump event but his jump of 6.88m was woefully short of the Sanjoy Rais meet record.

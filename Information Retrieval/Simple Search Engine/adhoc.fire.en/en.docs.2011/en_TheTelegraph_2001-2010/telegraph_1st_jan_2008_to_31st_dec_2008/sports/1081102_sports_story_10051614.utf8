The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumbles time is up: Dilip
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kumbles time is up: Dilip
                  Dilip Vengsarkar                     
	New Delhi: Former chairman of selection commitee Dilip Vengsarkar Saturday gave a thumbs down to Test skipper Anil Kumble and said that he doesnt forsee the leg-spinner captaining the side after the on-going series against Australia.         
	Vengsarkar said, Though Kumble has rendered a yeoman service to the Indian cricket team, his poor form suggested he should quit. Kumble has not been performing since the last six to seven Tests.         
	He has served the country for the last 18 years but he has not done anything of note in the last few matches, his time is up now, Vengsarkar added.         
	Kumble looked completely off-colour in the match and I dont see him captaining the side after the Nagpur Test, he added.         
	Vengsarkar felt that Kumble did not handle fellow leggie Amit Mishra properly in the third Test match.         
	Mishra was bowling quite well and was getting good zip but still Jumbo underbowled him, Vengsarkar said.         
	While Vengsarkar was the chairman of selectors, there were reports in the media that the seniors of the Indian team had been asked to retire or be axed. The reports, however, were denied by all concerned. (PTI)

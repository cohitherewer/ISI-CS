  - Belgian world No. 1 brings a wonderful adventure to end             Justine Henin at a media conference in Limelette on Wednesday. (AP)                           
	Limelette (Belgium): World No. 1 Justine Henin announced she was retiring from professional tennis with immediate effect on Wednesday at the age of 25.         
	Its the end of a wonderful adventure but its something I have been thinking about for a long time, the Belgian, who won 41 titles since turning professional in 1999, told a news conference.         
	Henins surprise decision came less than two weeks before the start of the French Open, a tournament she has won four times, including the last three years.         
	Henin, the winner of seven Grand Slam titles, won 10 tournaments last year, but has been in one of the worst slumps of her career this season. She was upset last week in the third round of the German Open and pulled out of this weeks Italian Open citing fatigue.         
	 I am leaving as the world number one and that is important and it is always better to go out at the top, said Henin, her voice cracking and eyes watering.         
	 I have been driving my career based on an emotion but I didnt feel that emotion anymore since (last years season-ending championships in) Madrid.         
	At Madrid I felt I had reached the climax of my career. I had thought about taking a break, but in the end I didnt think this was the right decision.         
	I decided on returning from (last weeks tournament in) Berlin to stop now. I leave without any regrets and I know it is the right decision.         
	This is the end of a childs dream. This is a definitive decision. Those who know me know it is serious. I thought long about this, Henin said at a news conference,         
	Henins retirement came a day after Swedens Annika Sorenstam winner of 10 womens golf majors  announced that she was quitting at the end of the season.         
	Last year, Belgiums Kim Clijsters  a former No. 1 player  retired at 23. She has since married and become a mother.         
	Henin, who has battled through injuries and a divorce, had a standout season in 2007, winning two Grand Slams, eight other tour titles and more than US$5 million.         
	However, after winning her home tournament in Antwerp in February, she has been on one of the worst skids of her career, failing to go beyond the quarter finals at any event.         
	Henins year began with a 4-6, 0-6 loss to Maria Sharapova in the Australian Open quarter finals in January, followed by a 2-6, 0-6 drubbing by Serena Williams at the Sony Ericsson Open in April, the worst loss for a top-ranked player in nine years.         
	At last weeks German Open, Henin lost 7-5, 3-6, 1-6 to Dinara Safina.           (AGENCIES)

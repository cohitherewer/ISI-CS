The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I try not to mix things, says Lee
                                                                                                                                                                                                     I try not to mix things, says Lee
                      
	Melbourne: Miffed with media reports linking his poor on-field form to his marriage break-up, Australian pace spearhead Brett Lee has asserted that he always keeps his personal and professional life apart.         
	I try to keep to cricket; I dont try to mix things. I take it to heart if someone puts the emotional things in, especially if stuff is written in the paper about my emotional side, so I try to stick to the cricket, Lee was quoted as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald.         
	Lee has struggled on the ongoing Test tour of India, taking just seven wickets in the concluded three Tests at an average of over 50. His poor form has been blamed on the emotional turmoil that he has gone through after separating from his wife of two years, Elizabeth Kemp.

	Bloemfontein: A much stouter batting effort by Bangladesh helped them reach 67 for three in their follow-on innings on the third day of the first Test against South Africa in Bloemfontein on Friday.         
	The teams were forced to take an early lunch after lightning stopped play.         
	Led by Zunaed Siddique, Bangladesh reduced their deficit to 221 runs after being bowled out for 153 in reply to South Africas first innings of 441 for nine declared.         
	The 21-year-old left-hander batted for 100 minutes in scoring his 27 before Jacques Kallis removed him, Siddique edging a cut to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barcelona on top as Real go down
                                                                                                                                                                                           Barcelona on top as Real go down
                              
	Madrid: Barcelona went six points clear at the top of the Primera Liga with a 3-0 win away to Sevilla on Saturday after second-placed Real Madrid lost 3-1 at Getafe.         
	Barcelonas Samuel Eto got a typical poachers goal, bursting into the area to stab a loose ball high into the net after 20 minutes of a pulsating encounter at the Sanchez Pizjuan.         
	Barcelona dominated possession but Lionel Messi was closely marshalled until the 79th minute, when he raced on to a long ball and volleyed past Andres Palop.         
	The Argentine forward scampered after another long ball to round Palop for his second goal in the final minute by which time Sevilla were down to 10 men. Brazilian striker Luis Fabiano was sent off for elbowing in the 86th.         
	Barcelona moved on to 32 points from 13 games, six ahead of Real.         
	Real were trailing from the third minute, when Jaime Gavilans run and cross from the left was met by a powerful header from Uruguayan forward Juan Albin.         
	The home side were unlucky not to be awarded a penalty just before the break but two minutes after the restart Albin broke away to surprise Iker Casillas by scoring at his near post.         
	In Serie A Mauro Camoranesi shrugged off an arm injury and driving sleet to score one goal and set up another as Juventus thrashed Reggina 4-0 to move joint-second with AC Milan in Serie A on Saturday.         
	Juventus are now three points behind leaders Inter Milan. Winger Camoranesi, who kept his right arm by his side throughout the first half before being substituted, blasted home the opener in the 28th minute after Pavel Nedved pulled the ball back following Alessandro Del Pieros backheel.         
	Amauri doubled the lead on the stroke of halftime when he prodded the ball into the net after the visiting defence failed to clear Camoranesis cross.         
	Juventus, beaten 1-0 at Inter last weekend, made it three when defender Giorgio Chiellini glanced in Marco Marchionnis free kick just past the hour and Del Piero netted his 250th Juventus goal with a penalty after a dubious foul on Sebastian Giovinco.         
	Third-from-bottom Reggina had won their last two league games but rarely threatened on a bitterly cold Turin night, Santos hitting the bar with their best chance in the first half.         
	Lecce earlier edged two points clear of the drop zone after a sweet strike from substitute Jose Castillo snatched a 1-1 draw at Catania, who went ahead through forward Michele Paoluccis angled drive on 61 minutes.

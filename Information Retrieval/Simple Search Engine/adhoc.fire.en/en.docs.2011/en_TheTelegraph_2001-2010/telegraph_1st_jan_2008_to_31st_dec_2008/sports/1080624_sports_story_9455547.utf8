The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ribery backs coach
                                                                                                                                                                                           EURO DIARY
                      
	Ribery backs coach  
	Paris: France winger Franck Ribery has backed coach Raymond Domenech, who has been widely criticised after their group stage exit from Euro 2008. I think Domenech must not go. He must keep on working with this squad, he was quoted as saying in a French magazine on Monday. If some mistakes were made, Domenech was not alone. Frankly, Id like him to stay, he added in the French daily. French media have been speculating about Domenechs future since France bowed out of Euro 2008 after finishing at the bottom of Group C with one point and one goal from three matches.  
	Frings ready         
	 Tenero: Torsten Frings has recovered sufficiently from a fractured rib and could return to the German team to face Turkey in Wednesdays Euro 2008 semifinal, coach Joachim Loew said on Monday. Im fortunate to be able to say that all 23 players trained today and are fit, Loew told the media. Torsten trained completely normally, but with a protective bandage. He said he had no major problems. He will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play, yes.         
	Donadoni defiant         
	 Baden (Austria): Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said on Monday he would not quit despite their Euro 2008 quarterfinal exit, maintaining his view that the world champions had played well in the tournament. Critics have said a woeful Italy lacked ideas and energy in Austria and Switzerland and the Italian media expect Donadoni to be sacked by the countrys soccer federation with 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi poised to return. Absolutely no, Donadoni told a news conference I dont have a reason. We only lost a game on penalties. You cant say things work when you win but dont work when you lose on penalties. We will talk and decide. It doesnt make any sense to talk about whether I deserve to carry on.         
	Demirel out         
	 Vienna: Turkey goalkeeper Volkan Demirel will miss Wednesdays Euro 2008 semi-final against Germany after organisers rejected the Turkish federations appeal against his two-match ban, Uefa said on Monday. Volkan was suspended for pushing Jan Koller during their 3-2 win over Czech Republic.         
	Late goals         
	 Basel: Late goals that have turned around matches are no accident but the result of coaches making bold use of substitutions, Uefas technical director Andy Roxburgh said on Monday. Roxburgh, who watched all 16 teams in the tournament, said other trends had also been noted such as swift counter-attacking play and ploys to defend against being caught on the break. But he added: What we are seeing in the Champions League, and also here, is people keeping their gunpowder dry. Coaches are changing things late.         
	Rosetti for final         
	 Vienna: Italian Roberto Rosetti will officiate in the final in Vienna on Sunday, Uefa said on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Johnson leads Aussies to win 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Johnson leads Aussies to win 
                      
	Australia took only 48 minutes on Day IV to wrap up New Zealands last four wickets and claim a 149-run win in the first Test at the Gabba.         
	According to cricinfo, Man of the Match Mitchell Johnson finished with his first five-wicket haul in Tests and Stuart Clark ended up with four victims as New Zealands collapsible tail lived up to its reputation and they were bundled out for 177.         
	New Zealand, who resumed the day requiring 184 runs for victory with four wickets left, lost Daniel Vettori and Ross Taylor to Johnson within 18 runs.         
	The next man out was Iain Brien, who lobbed a simple chance to Michael Clarke at 9 for 164.         
	Chris Martin was the last batsman out. He was bowled from the first straight ball he received from Johnson. The stumps rattled, Australia celebrated and it left Johnson with 5 for 39.

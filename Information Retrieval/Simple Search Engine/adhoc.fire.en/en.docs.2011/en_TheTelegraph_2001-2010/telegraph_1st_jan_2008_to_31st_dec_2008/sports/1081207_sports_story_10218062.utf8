The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Champagne days over for F1
                                                                                                                                                                                             Champagne days over for F1

	Gentlemen, Formula One is becoming unsustainable. That was the top line of a letter sent to the teams by Max Mosley, president of Formula Ones ruling body, the FIA, in July.         
	Mosley had just emerged victorious from his privacy action at the High Court in London. Champagne might have been the order of the day. He recognised that for him in his personal predicament and F1 in its financial crisis, the champagne days were over. F1 could no longer afford itself.         
	Mosley has been banging the cost-cutting drum for the past five years, introducing any number of initiatives from long-life engines to development freezes. It is a recurring theme. Twenty years ago, when F1 was last in the grip of global financial ruin and down to half a dozen teams, its creator, Bernie Ecclestone, stripped the cost out of competing overnight by introducing normally-aspirated engines to run alongside the ultra-expensive turbo monsters favoured by the big spenders.         
	Thus in 1988 March pitched up running one normally-aspirated car at a cost of $1.5 million for the season. McLaren spent $20 million to send Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost into turbo-charged wonderland. Within two years the turbos were gone and teams were flocking to the sport once more.         
	A generation later, with F1 again feeding too high on the hog, Ecclestone is required to fashion a response. Last Thursday, before news of Hondas demise broke, the teams met to discuss further cost-cutting measures to be rubber-stamped at next weeks World Council meeting. Outgoing Honda chief executive Nick Fry estimates savings of $70 million (48 million) a year in 2009.         
	That will not go far enough for Ecclestone, who wants to see an immediate end to the $500 million annual budget spent by the likes of Toyota and McLaren. Even Ferrari are feeling the pinch. Ecclestone understands that Formula One is first and foremost a sport, not a marketing exercise for motor manufacturers.         
	Investing huge sums in innovative technology that might or might not have consequences for the wider motoring industry misses the point. People tune in to watch a race. They neither see nor care about the space-age drama occurring beneath the engine cover.         
	The community of petrolheads might convince themselves of the sovereignty of drive trains and air flows over the importance of the driver, but the wider sporting public do not invest in that. The question for them is who won the race, not which car. Ecclestone and Mosley understand that and will use Hondas disappearing act to ram the message home.         
	They will get no argument from sponsors, whose millions allow teams to fund their madcap schemes in return for the global platform F1 provides. F1s pulling power is three times that of Premier League football, given the 100 million-plus Ferrari culled from Vodafone over their four-year relationship compared with the 36 million Manchester United received in the same period.         
	Dutch Insurance firm ING, the title sponsors of Renault, consider their 15-20 million-a-year deal a lump well worth paying for the increased brand awareness the association with F1 has brought. But the show cannot go on without cars on the track.         
	In 2001, after Ford had completed the purchase of Stewart Racing, Eddie Jordan used the occasion of his teams pre-season launch to remind observers of the transient nature of manufacturer involvement in F1. Come on down EJ the prophet. Ford have long since gone. Now Honda, too. Whos next? Toyota?

	Calcutta: The Hyderabad Race Club (HRC) Stewards have decided to cancel the December 14 and 15 race fixtures, according to an RCTC notification.          
	The cancellation follows the medication (vaccination) programme undertaken by HRC in the wake of the outbreak of equine influenza threat which has paralysed the sport in the other metropolis.

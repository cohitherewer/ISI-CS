  - Going back in time: some of the outstanding olympians                       
	IAN THORPE                   
	Name  Ian Thorpe
  Country  Australia
  Date of birth  1982-10-13
  Birthplace  Sydney
  Height  195 cm
  Weight  96.0 kg
  Disciplines  100m, 200m, 400m freestyle, freestyle relays
  World records  23 (18 in long-course: 200, 400, 800m freestyle, 4x100 and 4x200m freestyle relays, 5 in short-course: 200, 400m freestyle, 4x200m freestyle)
  Olympic Games (9 medals: 5 gold, 3 silver, 1 bronze)         
	Ian Thorpe, the remarkable Australian icon, has done it all: world records (23), world championship titles, Olympic golds (5) and multiple world championship victories. His exceptional strength, technique and ability made him one of the highest paid and immediately recognisable names in world sport.         
	A sign of how highly he was regarded could be seen by the wave of tributes that poured in when he surprisingly announced his retirement in November 2006 at the age of 24.         
	In fifty years from now Australians will still marvel at the feats of Ian Thorpe, was one of many compliments paid on this occasion by Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates. Although a modest man he had phenomenal drive in competition, setting himself goals which include beating his own personal best times.         
	At the world championships in Fukuoka, the Australian became the first person in history to take six world titles at a single meeting.         
	He had a phenomenal time in Manchester in 2002, winning six gold medals at the Commonwealth Games after collecting five at the Pan Pacific championships in Japan, where he is known as the Tiger Woods of swimming.    
	GARY HALL JUNIOR                   
	Name  Gary Hall Jr
  Country  United States
  Date of birth  1974-09-26
  Birthplace  Cincinnati (Ohio)
  Height  198 cm
  Weight  98.0 kg
  Discipline  50m and 100m freestyle
  World Records  3 (4x100m freestyle relay, 4x100m medley relay)
  Olympic Games (10 medals: 5 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze)         
	American sprint ace Gary Hall Jr took his Olympic medal tally to eight by the end of Sydney 2000 and finally nailed an individual gold in the 50m freestyle in a dead-heat finish with compatriot Anthony Ervin. A key member of the American team, he was also part of the 4x100 medley quartet that successfully defended their 1996 title with a world record time in Australia.         
	His impressive record also includes gold in the 1996 4x100 freestyle, three silver medals and a bronze.         
	Born in Ohio, Hall Jr is the son of Gary Hall, who successfully represented the United States at the Olympic Games of 1968, 1972 and 1976.         
	But while his father, whose medals exploits include a 200m butterfly silver at the Munich Games in 1972 (beaten by Mark Spitz), was perceived as a swimming role model and even carried the US delegations flag at Montreal (1976), Hall Jrs career has been somewhat less ideal.         
	His career was threatened after he was suspended for three months by the sports governing body, Fina, for marijuana use in 1998.         
	Diagnosed with diabetes in March of 1999, Hall Jrs Sydney prospects were looking slim until he stormed back into contention when he won the 50m at the 1999 US Summer Championships in 22.13 seconds.         
	In characteristically defiant fashion, he has used his illness as a motivating factor.    
	ALEXANDER KARELINE                   
	Name  Alexander Kareline
  Country  Russia
  Date of birth  1967-09-19
  Birthplace  Novossibirsk (USSR)
  Height  192 cm
  Weight  130.0 kg
  Sport  Wrestling (Greco-roman)
  Category  130 kg
  Olympic Games (4 medals: 3 gold, 1 silver)         
	A modern-day Hercules was born in Siberia on September 19, 1967. The giant Alexander Kareline (1.92m/130kg) forged himself one of the best honours lists in the history of wrestling, remaining unbeaten in the Greco-roman from his first European title in 1988 until the final of the Sydney Games of 2000.         
	Its easy to see why the Russian strongman was one of the most feared and respected competitors on the planet  12 European titles, nine world crowns and three Olympic gold medals provide sufficient testament to his ability, allowing Kareline to surpass illustrious compatriot Alexander Medved  the triple Olympic freestyle champion during the 1960s who also wrested eight world titles from the hands of his opponents.         
	A keen jazz and classical music fan who also loves English literature, he is as gentle about town as he was unrelenting on the mat, where he regularly left his rivals with little chance of success, notably using his favourite move, the reverse lifting hold.         
	A virtual demi-God in his native north, Karelines financial situation is as sound as his physique.    
	NAIM SULEYMANOGLOU                   
	Name  Naim Suleymanoglou
  Country  Turkey
  Date of birth  1967-01-23
  Birthplace  Kircali (Bulgaria)
  Height  149 cm
  Weight  60.0 kg
  Categories  -56 kg, -60 kg, -62 kg, - 64kg
  Olympic Games (3 medals: 3 gold)         
	Small in stature, but huge in talent, the Turkish weightlifter of Bulgarian origin Naim Suleymanoglu now forms an indelible part of the record books having won an unprecedented three straight Olympic titles.         
	Born in Bulgaria, the son of a Turkish zinc miner, Suleymanoglu opted for Turkish nationality in 1986, following an episode of internationally significant proportions.         
	As a member of the uprooted Turkish community in Bulgaria, Naim was affected by the governments decision to oppress his peoples culture and traditions. Incensed, from that moment he had only one objective: to join the country of his ancestors.         
	On his return home, his passport was taken and re-issued, complete with a Bulgarian name Naum Shalamanov. He was also falsely quoted in a newspaper saying that he was proud of his Bulgarian nationality.         
	This proved enough and, on December 13, 1986 during the Weightlifting World Cup in Melbourne, he defected with the help of the Australian Turkish community.         
	While Bulgarian authorities fumed in anger, his sports career was temporarily stopped by the International Weightlifting Federation: he was suspended for a year, reappearing at the Olympic Games in Seoul in 1988 after the Eastern boycott of the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.    
	ROBERT KORZENIOWSKI                   
	Name  Robert Korzeniowski
  Country  Poland
  Date of birth  1968-07-30
  Birthplace  Lubaczow
  Height  170 cm
  Weight  62.0 kg
  Discipline  20 km and 50 km walking
  World Records  1 (50 km walk) - 3hr 36min 03sec (Paris 27/08/2003)
  Olympic Games (4 medals: 4 gold)         
	Polands Robert Korzeniowski confirmed his domination in the often derided athletic discipline of walking when he pulled off a magnificent double at the Sydney 2000 Olympics striding to both 20km and 50km gold.         
	He thereby became the first athlete to win gold at the longer distance in two consecutive Olympics as he had enjoyed the same delight at Atlanta four years earlier.         
	He won a third world title over 50km in 2003 as he outdistanced the field on the streets of Paris and broke the tape first at the finish line in the Stade de France.         
	If that wasnt enough, no one could stop him at Athens in 2004 where he won his third Olympic title joining an elite club of four-time winners, including Emil Zatopek, Lasse Viren, Al Oerter and Carl Lewis.         
	All this was something of a turnaround as Korzeniowski had suffered bitter disappointment at Barcelona 1992, where he had to pull out of the 20km before suffering the agony of disqualification in the 50km.         
	But how the wheels of fortune turn. Korzeniowski crossed the Sydney 20km line second behind Bernardo Segura in 2000.         
	The Mexican though, soon received the shattering news that officials had disqualified him for illegal style in the home straight and were awarding gold to Korzeniowski.         
	His career has seen as many bitter lows as sweet highs.

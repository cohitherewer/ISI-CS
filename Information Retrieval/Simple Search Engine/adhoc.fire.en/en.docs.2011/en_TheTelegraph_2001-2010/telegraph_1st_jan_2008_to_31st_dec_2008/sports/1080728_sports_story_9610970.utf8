The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal makes title round
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nadal makes title round
                  Nicolas Kiefer                     
	Toronto: World No. 2 Rafael Nadal battled to a scrappy 7-6, 6-3 win over Briton Andy Murray on Saturday to set up a Toronto Masters final against resurgent German Nicolas Kiefer.         
	Nadal, playing his first event since his epic win over Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final, has made a smooth transition from grass to the North American hardcourts.         
	The Spaniards victory stretched his winning streak to 28 matches and left him on course for a fifth consecutive title following wins at Wimbledon, Queens, Roland Garros and Hamburg.         
	My only expectation is to try and play a good match in final, and if possible win the title, Nadal, who won his first career hardcourt title in Canada in 2005, told reporters. I said when I arrive here I dont think about No. 1, I dont think about the hardcourt season or U.S. Open or Olympics, I think about Toronto. Toronto is a very important tournament. Its the first big tournament on hard after the clay and grass court season, so my goal is try to play a good tournament here.         
	Standing in Nadals way is the experienced Kiefer, who outlasted in-form Frenchman Gilles Simon 6-7, 6-3, 7-6 to continue his bid for his first ATP title since 2000. In four career meetings, Murray had never beaten Nadal but appeared eager to put that right, matching the muscular Spaniard shot-for-shot during a tense opening set that failed to produce a break.         
	Nadal dominated the tie-break 7-2, after which Murray called for the trainer and had his right knee taped. The Briton continued to battle in the second set until Nadal took control, sweeping through the last three games.         
	The 31-year-old Kiefer needed all his experience and three hours to beat his 23-year-old opponent, who has had a superb start to the North American hardcourt season.         
	In doubles action, Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy crashed out with a straight-set defeat at the hands of second seeds Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic in the semifinals.         
	The seventh -seeded Indo-Czech pair went down 3-6 ,6-7 (5) to Nestor and Zimonjic.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Long way to go: Shabbir
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings 3-1 victory on Sunday has left coach Shabbir Ali happy. You cannot expect better football in these slushy conditions, he said after the match.         
	There is still a long way to go This was our first game and there is scope for lot of improvement. The defence lacks cohesion and things will improve as we play more matches, the former international said.         
	Shabbir felt the arrival of Roque Barreto and Vinoo Jones will strengthen the side from the next match. They will certainly add to our strength. But Im also happy with the way we performed on today (Sunday).         
	Shabbir was impressed by under-19 Mizoram boy Lalchhuan Awma.

                                                     Dont poach, says WI coach to IPL
                  Gayle                     
	Melbourne: West Indies coach John Dyson has urged the organisers of the Indian Premier League (IPL) not to cannibalise teams, requesting them to allow three of his key players  Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul  to play the first two Tests against Australia.         
	With West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) admitting that batting mainstays Gayle, Sarwan and Chanderpaul may miss the first two Tests against Australia owing to IPL commitments, Dyson reminded the IPL authorities their promise not to tinker with the existing international calendar.         
	It was my understanding that the IPL chiefs have said that international cricket remains the priority, and now it is up to them to keep their promise, Dyson told a local newspaper from Guyana.         
	With the amount of money involved, if an IPL franchise was to pressurise our players into completing the tournament, they would be in a very difficult situation, he said. I assume the IPL bosses have sat down and thought about the long-term future of their tournament and have considered the question of where their next generation of players will come from.         
	Its important, then, that they dont cannibalise international or domestic competitions as they stand, because they will presumably need players to come through in the future, Dyson said.         
	The coach, however, believed he would have all the players at his disposal well before the series against Australia started.         
	IPL commissioner and chairman Lalit Modi put the ball in WICBs court and said, if the players you have named have made a special arrangement with the board, we will not refuse them.

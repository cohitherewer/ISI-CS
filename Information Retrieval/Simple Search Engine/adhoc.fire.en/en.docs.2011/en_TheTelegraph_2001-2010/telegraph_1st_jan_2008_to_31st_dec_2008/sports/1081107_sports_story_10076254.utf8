                                                                                                                                                                                                       The team will miss you: Tendulkar to Sourav
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            V. V. S. Laxman, Anil Kumble, Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar at a felicitation in Nagpur on Thursday. (AFP)                           
	Nagpur: The BCCI on Thursday honoured the senior members of the team  Sachin Tendulkar (on becoming Test crickets leading run-getter), V.V.S. Laxman (on completing 100 Tests), Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly (for their service to Indian cricket)  at a felicitation also attended by some members of the Australian team among others, at the new VCA Stadium.         
	The four legends spoke on the occasion.               
	The following are excerpts               
	LAXMAN         
	It is a great honour and proud moment for me. My parents were doctors and I too wanted to become a doctor. Playing for India was a fantasy, a dream. I wanted to emulate my dad who has been a role model for me. But as destiny would have it, now I have become a better kid. I also thank my uncle who spotted the talent in me.         
	Last but not the least, I thank my wife for all the support. Being an international cricketer is tough, especially in India. I am sure, Anjali, Chetna and Dona will all agree with me. Special thanks to my teammates. Our goal is to be the No. 1 in all three forms of the game. I hope I have contributed to that and am sure we will achieve our goal.         
	TENDULKAR         
	It truly feels special. Its any childs dream to play for India, and I always grew up dreaming the same. Its been 19 years, it has been an eventful journey.         
	On Kumble         
	I remember that way back in 1988-89, I was told that he was actually a good batsman who could bowl. From there, what he has gone on to achieve in Tests is truly remarkable. The most memorable thing about him is his grit and determination. He has always been there with the team 100 per cent. In the West Indies, his jaw was broken and he still came on to bowl and got the wicket of Lara. Thats Anil for you. There couldnt have been a more committed team member.         
	On Laxman         
	I remember in 1996-97 on the South Africa tour, he was very shy. Not any more... He got hurt on the knuckles and had a fracture. He was sitting in the corner of the dressing room and crying. I went up to him and told him that he has a long way to go. Laxman! You deserve every bit of praise you are getting now. Your performances were under-rated!         
	On Sourav         
	He has had his ups and downs but he has shown the grit and determination to overcome them. There have been obstacles but he fought through them. Having been together for so long, we know each others game so well... Souravs contribution has been terrific... Occasionally, he has tried to teach me some Bengali! We will miss you. The entire team will miss you. You have been a terrific contributor         
	KUMBLE         
	Its been an emotional few days for me. I am not someone who shows his emotions, but it is tough to know that your time is up. I thank my teammates. The welcome you gave me in Delhi was overwhelming. The last three days have been tough for me. To understand what cricket means in India, the support, the messages, the words  it has been really overwhelming.         
	Eighteen years is a long time to have been part of the Indian cricket team. It is time now to give some time back to the family and kids.         
	To Laxman         
	You have been a fantastic player. Like Sachin said, I dont think you got what you deserved. The team, though, has known your worth and youre worth your weight in gold.         
	To Sourav         
	Its hard to come and watch a cricket match from the stands. So enjoy the last four days Youve been fantastic and its under you that we learnt to win Testsabroad. We cherished your batting. You had the opportunity to do everything possible on the field. All the best in your retired life! Thanks for your support.         
	To Sachin         
	Its never easy. The first paper clipping I have says Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble score centuries. He scored for West Zone and I for South Zone. We have come a long way. When you came on the international scene, the whole of India said you will break all the records. Now, you have done that. To me, they said I know to bowl leg-spin but not leg-break. Youve had the challenge to prove everybody right, I had the challenge to prove everybody wrong...         
	To Rahul Dravid         
	We have had a special bond. There have been many moments to cherish. You have been the backbone of the team. All the success the team has had is because of you         
	To Venkatesh Prasad         
	Venky, I never thought there will be a time when you will be the bowling coach and I still will be playing. When I look around, there is Chika, Dilip and Ravi, and Gary as well  they all have become coach or something, and I am still playing.         
	To Harbhajan Singh         
	I will miss you as a spin partner. I am sure you will lead the team well. You are close to a landmark. Am sure you will go on to become the highest wicket-taker for India.         
	To Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Gary Kirsten         
	With you I know this team will become No. 1.         
	SOURAV         
	It has been an immense pleasure. Sharing the dressing with Sachin, Rahul, Anil and VVS has been a dream come true. Given my background, I led an easy life. It (the game) has been a learning experience, not only for cricket but also for life. MS and Gary, you are the torchbearers of the team now. Over the past 12-13 years Ive made good friends and made some enemies, but it was all for the good of Indian cricket and, hopefully, youve enjoyed walking the path with me.

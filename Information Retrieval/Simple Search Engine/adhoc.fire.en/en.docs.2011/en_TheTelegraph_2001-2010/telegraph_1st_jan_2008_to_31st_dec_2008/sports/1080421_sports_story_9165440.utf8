The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC must make space for IPL: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ICC must make space for IPL: Dhoni
                  Dhoni                     
	Chandigarh: The International Cricket Council (ICC) would have to adjust Indian Premier League (IPL) in its calendar or else cricketers may be forced to opt for premature retirement, Indias ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Sunday. ICC needs to take this decision otherwise we may have a situation where cricketers will prefer retirement, Dhoni said before leaving for Chennai.         
	Team Indias wicketkeeper-batsman felt that the IPL would become an annual feature. Outgoing ICC CEO Malcom Speed, however, said in Mumbai recently that there was no immediate need to carve out a slot for the IPL in the Future Tours Programme. Dhoni saw nothing wrong in players making money by playing in the cash-rich league.         
	A player has to think about his future too.         
	On if young cricketers were in the danger of losing their focus with so much money, Dhoni said, players know it very well that money will flow as long they are doing well. I know these days even the young cricketers are quite mature and know that money is only a part of sport, not everything.         
	On how the IPL had rolled out, the 26-year-old Dhoni said, its going to be a huge success.         
	However, Dhoni felt it could take over a year before crowds strongly relate to the city-based concept.         
	He, however, said it was great to have players from different nations sharing the same dressing room and felt it would go a long way in strengthening bonds between players.

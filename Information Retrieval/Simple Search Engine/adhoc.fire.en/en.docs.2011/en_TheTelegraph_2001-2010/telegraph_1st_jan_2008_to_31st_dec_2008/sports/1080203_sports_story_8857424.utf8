                                                   Arsenal back at the top 

           
	London: Arsenal swapped places with champions Manchester United at the top of the Premier League on Saturday after a 3-1 victory at Manchester City preceded Uniteds 1-1 draw away at Tottenham Hotspur. 
    
	Two goals for Emmanuel Adebayor and one for Eduardo de Silva made Arsenal the first team to win at City in the league this season and put them on 60 points. 
    
	United, who could have returned to the summit with three points in a later kick-off at White Hart Lane, trailed to Dimitar Berbatovs first-half effort but levelled three minutes into stoppage time with a Michael Dawson own goal. 
    
	United are two points behind, while third-placed Chelsea are six adrift after drawing 1-1 at Portsmouth for whom deadline day signing Jermain Defoe scored on his debut. 
    
	Everton stayed fourth after a 0-0 draw at Blackburn Rovers while at the bottom end of the table there were important victories for Wigan Athletic against West Ham United and Bolton Wanderers over Reading. Bottom club Derby County drew 1-1 away with Birmingham City.

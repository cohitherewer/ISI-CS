	Noida: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia will be seen in action on Wednesday, 10 days after his stunning triumph in the Indian Masters in Delhi. He will tee up in the star-studded $400,000 SAIL Open at Jaypee Greens here.         
	The tournament is co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI).         
	I took a break after I won the Indian Masters. I wanted to have fun, said Chowrasia on Tuesday. I enjoyed my moments with caddies like Bhai, Raja and Rakesh at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. Everyone at the club was so happy after I won the title.         
	There was enough celebration and I thoroughly enjoyed the attention, he added. Now, it is time to get back to the golf course and win a few more laurels.         
	I needed time for myself and to re-think my whole career, said Chowrasia, who arrived in Delhi on Monday night and had a practice round at the Greg Norman-designed Jaypee Greens earlier on Tuesday. All the celebration back home was great, but I did manage a little bit of practice.         
	I would like to play 20 to 22 tournaments in Europe but I am not always very comfortable with the cold climate there, he said.         
	Chowrasia said that BILT group chief Gautam Thapar, who is also president of the PGTI, has agreed to sponsor him.         
	Besides Chowrasia, the tournament has attracted stars like Jyoti Randhawa, Digvijay Singh, Gaurav Ghei, Thaworn Wiratchant (Thailand ) and Hendrik Buhrmann ( South Africa ).         
	However, it received a blow by the last-minute withdrawals of Jeev Milkha Singh and Arjun Atwal. Jeev is indisposed, while Atwal is said to be recovering from an injury. Shiv Kapur, too, has cried off because of a family commitment.         
	Randhawa, however, was confident that the tournament would be keenly contested. Indian golf is seeing a big change. We have a whole lot of talented players who can win on any given day, he said.         
	Seasoned campaigners Amandeep Johl, Harmeet Kahlon, Ashok Kumar and Firoz Ali are also in the fray as are the youth brigade led by Gurbaaz Mann, Gaganjeet Bhullar, Anirban Lahiri and Ranjit Singh.         
	Chowrasia, now 7th in the European Tour Order of Merit with an earning of Euro 280,561, will have to retain his top 10 place till March in order to qualify for next months World Golf Championship.

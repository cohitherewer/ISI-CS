The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No fresh dates for 75 years function
                                                                                                                                                                                                     No fresh dates for 75 years function

	Calcutta: Despite the question mark after the terror strikes in Mumbai, Thursday will see the India-England Test series beginning on schedule (though at a different venue, Chennai), but the function to mark 75 years of Test cricket in the country has been put off indefinitely.         
	The Bombay Gymkhana staged the inaugural Test, against England (between December 15-18, 1933), and was to have hosted the celebrations on December 17, two days before the second and final Test of the latest series.         
	[England captained by Douglas Jardine, incidentally, won that first-ever Test in India by nine wickets.]         
	Mumbai, however, is not on the visitors itinerary this time and that Test has been shifted to Mohali.         
	With Mumbai not staging any Test now, the function is off. Fresh dates havent been worked out, Ratnakar Shetty, chief administrative officer of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), told The Telegraph.         
	The BCCI, though, intends releasing the souvenir brought out for the occasion at some point before or during the Mohali Test, which begins on December 19.         
	According to Shetty, former India captains have contributed special articles with the focus being on the growth and development of cricket in the country.         
	The release is likely to be a low-key affair. That would actually be in keeping with the post-Mumbai mood.

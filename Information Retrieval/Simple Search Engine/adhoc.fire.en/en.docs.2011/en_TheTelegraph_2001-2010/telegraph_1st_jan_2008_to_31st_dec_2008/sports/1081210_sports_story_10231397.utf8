The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pledge to help Mumbai victims
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pledge to help Mumbai victims
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Chennai: Englands players will donate half their match fees from the first Test against India to the families of the Mumbai terror victims.         
	Following a meeting at the team hotel, the players issued a joint statement pledging fees of around 35,000 to help those affected by the attacks two weeks ago, which killed nearly 200 people.         
	The statement, which was read by opening batsman Alastair Cook, said: The England players will donate half their match fees from the first Test to the families of those victims of the Mumbai attacks.         
	It also underlined Englands reasons for returning to India following a week of soul-searching over whether to go back in the aftermath of the attacks.         
	Their return signified the open and public statement of support for the Indian people following the tragic events in Mumbai recently, according to the statement, in which they also extended their sympathies to those affected by the attacks.         
	Cook added: We have made a massive pact this morning at our meeting when we came up with the statement that this is it and nothing else can distract us from playing cricket.         
	It was something that everyone wanted to get across because as a side we felt we wanted to do it.         
	Englands decision to resume the tour has been widely applauded, but there has still been a suggestion that the players have been motivated by Indias huge financial clout. Cook, though, insisted that the only consideration among the squad was whether the tour would be safe.         
	Everyone is entitled to their opinion and their writings, he said. We sat down and made decisions as a side through our security adviser and thats been important. All that other stuff does not affect the players.         
	Earlier, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had pledged match fees from both the Tests for a similar cause.

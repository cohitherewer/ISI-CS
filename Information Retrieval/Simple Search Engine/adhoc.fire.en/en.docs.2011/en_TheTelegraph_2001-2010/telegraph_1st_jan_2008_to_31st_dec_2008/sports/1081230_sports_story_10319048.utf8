            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta: The wait is over as the RCTC is all geared up for the New Years Day races. The sport resumes after about 10 weeks following the outbreak of equine fever which affected the Hastings stables. Although the 450-odd horse-strength in the RCTC had fully recovered last month, it took nearly another month to bring all thoroughbreds to racing fitness.           
	The afternoon promises excitement as fields in the eight-event, featuring the 1,200m RCTC New Years Trophy, race averages out at a shade under 10 runners. Incidentally, all races are trophy events and the first race starts at 12 noon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Release a technical decision: Shah Rukh
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Release a technical decision: Shah Rukh
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders owner Shah Rukh Khan said on Tuesday that the decision to release five of their contracted players  Ranadeb Bose, Sourasish Lahiri, Rohan Banerjee, Cheteswar Pujara and Yashpal Singh  by Sunday was a technical one.         
	John Buchanan feels we should concentrate on a core team. Its a technical decision. They still remain part of the team. Its not that any money will be deducted from their earnings.         
	They could have been useful if practice matches were held but there is no time for such ties.         
	So it is important to concentrate on a core group now that we are coming close to the end of the tournament. Match practice is important and they will only benefit from playing elsewhere, said Shah Rukh after arriving in the city.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Croatia aim for upset vs Austria
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Croatia aim for upset vs Austria

	Bad Tatzmannsdorf, (Austria): The time has come for Croatias strikers to end their goal drought, Ivica Olic said on Friday.         
	Croatias hit men have failed to find the net since Mladen Petric struck in the 3-2 qualifying win over England at Wembley in November, a barren sequence of four friendlies.         
	Olic and his colleagues launch their Euro 2008 campaign against co-hosts Austria in Vienna on Sunday.         
	Although our injured top scorer Eduardo da Silva is not here, I think we have enough firepower up front as all five strikers have worked hard in training and its time we delivered.         
	We will have to work hard in what is likely to be a tough match with few clear-cut chances, Olic said .         
	Striker Olic, who netted Croatias second goal against England, is hoping the team can reproduce the performance at Wembley that he said would always live in his memory.         
	We need to repeat that on Sunday and I would gladly settle for the same score line, he said.         
	We will show against the Austrians how much progress we have made in training.         
	Coach Slaven Bilic said Croatia would have to show respect for the co-hosts.         
	We will not underestimate them for one second because they have had two years to build a side capable of upsetting more heralded rivals, said Bilic.         
	It will be the first competitive meeting between the two sides. Croatia have won all three friendlies against Austria including a 4-1 drubbing the last time they clashed in Vienna in 2006.

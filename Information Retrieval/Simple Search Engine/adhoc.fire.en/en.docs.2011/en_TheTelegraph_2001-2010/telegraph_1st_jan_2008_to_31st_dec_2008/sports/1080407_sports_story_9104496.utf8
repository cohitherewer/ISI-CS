The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tigers quest to reclaim Augusta 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tigers quest to reclaim Augusta 
            Mark Reason            Tiger Woods                           
	Its madness, I tell you. Golf is a game of uncertainties, of capricious breezes and bad bounces. Its a game of too many moving body parts and paralysed brains. We drive to the course, get out of the car and a falling conker fells us like the Norsemans axe. In short golf, like life, is a game of chance.         
	Tell that to Tiger Woods. He has won seven of the last eight tournaments that he has played in. Woods, it seems, is turning golf into a game of probabilities. In some places he is odds-on to win the Masters, the shortest-priced favourite in history. Its against the laws of nature.         
	Its also against the even more irrefutable laws of PG Wodehouse: Golf, says the Oldest Member, ruminating on the terrace, acts as a corrective against sinful pride. I attribute the insane arrogance of the later Roman emperors almost entirely to the fact that, never having played golf, they never knew that strange chastening humility which is engendered by a topped chip shot. If Cleopatra had been ousted in the first round of the ladies singles, we should have heard a lot less about her proud imperiousness.         
	This year is the 20th anniversary of Sandy Lyles victory in 1988  what a load of old parochial ho-hum. Its 50 years since the coining of Amen Corner  even more ho-hum. Gary Player will break Arnies record of 50 appearances. A man who shot a scarcely credible 30 over the final nine holes in 1978 to win a third green jacket is now reduced to the role of vaudeville hack.         
	None of it really seems to matter. Why get all misty-eyed over history when theres a bloke who is making history in front of you. What really matters is who can stop Tiger from winning a fifth green jacket? Phil Mickelson can stop him. At Doral a couple of weeks ago Mickelson was on the range beating a succession of long clubs from somewhere back in his stance in order to move the ball from right to left, a key shot at Augusta. Mickelson has won two of the last four Masters, Woods has won one of the previous five.         
	Geoff Ogilvy can win. He had a couple of train wrecks last year and was still in contention for much of the tournament. Mike Weir and Zach Johnson have shown that non-bombers with a great wedge-game can prevail at Augusta. Padraig Harrington left the course last year saying: I walked away from this tournament knowing that Im capable of winning the Masters. Many of the young Brits, three of whom finished in the top 10 last year, will feel the same. Luke Donald says: Ive played well there and contended a couple of times and theres no reason why come Sunday I cant tee it up having a chance to win.         
	Even Nick Dougherty, who played a number of practice rounds at Augusta last week in order to rid himself of the wow factor, says: Id be pleased with a top 10, but I dont rule out the fact that I could feasibly win it. Its golf, after all.         
	Tiger remains unimpressed. When asked last year about the young players coming through he simply said: Who? Woods then said of Augusta: The whole idea is never to make a double bogey round this place. If you dont make doubles and you dont make three-putts usually youre going to be in contention to win the tournament.

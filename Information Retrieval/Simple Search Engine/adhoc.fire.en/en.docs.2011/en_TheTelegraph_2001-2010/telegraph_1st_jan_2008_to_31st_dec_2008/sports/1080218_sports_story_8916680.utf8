The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichung confident of AFC Cup success 
                                                     Bhaichung confident of AFC Cup success 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: After tasting success in the Nehru Cup last September, Bhaichung Bhutia is now aiming to repeat the feat in the AFC Challenge Cup to be held either in Delhi or Hyderabad in August.         
	Talking to the media during a function in the capital on Sunday, the national captain said a victory in the AFC Challenge Cup would give Indian football a big boost.         
	Nothing can be compared with the success of the national team, the ace striker said. I had said it before also. Thats the only way to popularise the game in the country, he added.         
	Club football, Bhaichung said, is very important but it doesnt stretch the imagination of general public like the national team does. The public identifies themselves with the national side.         
	Bhaichung said India should play international matches frequently. Thats the only way to improve our Fifa rankings, he felt.         
	The Mohun Bagan striker was confident that India would do well in the SAFF Cup in June and the AFC Challenge Cup at home in August.         
	Under our national coach Bob Houghton, we had prepared very well last season. This time also the federation and the coach are chalking out the right plans. You can expect good result from the national side.

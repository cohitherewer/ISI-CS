	Pak PM may meet task force  Karachi: In an attempt to put all security fears to rest, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is now planning to fix a meeting between the International Cricket Council rsquo;s (ICC) special task force and Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gillani next month.  ldquo;The task force will be meeting top-level government officials on its visit to Pakistan and if possible we will also arrange for a meeting with the Prime Minister, rdquo; PCB CEO Shafqat Naghmi was quoted as saying in a newspaper.
  The dates of the task force rsquo;s visit is yet to be finalised, but it is expected to come here in the middle of August.  
	Aussies on top  Calcutta: Australia have retained their lead at the head of the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Championship table following the annual update, according to an ICC release. Ricky Ponting and his men are two rating points clear of their nearest challengers South Africa. New Zealand are third, while India retain the fourth spot.  The only change in the teams rsquo; rankings as a result of the update sees England and Sri Lanka swapping places, says A Staff Reporter.

Bangladesh, 10. Ireland, 11. Zimbabwe, 12. Kenya.  
	Sohail rsquo;s praise  Dubai: Sohail Tanvir cannot stop praising his Rajasthan Royals skipper Shane Warne and believes Australia made a blunder by not offering Test captaincy to the spin legend. Sohail recalled how Warne lead the IPL underdogs to the title defying all odds and said the fact that Warne was never offered Australian captaincy on a long-term basis baffled him.  
	Lee rsquo;s view  Mumbai: Currently there are very few pitches in the world which aid fast bowling and this paucity needs to be met to encourage more youngsters to take up fast bowling, feels Australian Brett Lee.
  ldquo;The wickets these days are getting hard to bowl on. I say it tongue in cheek about there being no pitches in the world conducive to fast bowling, rdquo; the Australian said.  
	Expansion   Mumbai: The Mumbai Hockey Association on Thursday submitted a letter to the Maharashtra government agreeing to the stipulations laid down by the latter as a pre-condition to renew the lease of their premises which has ended.

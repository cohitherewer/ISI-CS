The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke still not sure about IPL
                                                                                                                                                                                           Clarke still not sure about IPL
                      
	Melbourne: England may have returned to India after the Mumbai terror attacks but Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke said he would have to think twice before signing for the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Clarke did not join an IPL franchise this year and is yet to make up his mind about entering the second season but said security was one of the issues he had to weigh before signing.         
	I have a lot of things to consider. Obviously I have to think about the amount of cricket we are playing, I am trying to plan a wedding as well and I have to think about what has happened there, said Clarke.

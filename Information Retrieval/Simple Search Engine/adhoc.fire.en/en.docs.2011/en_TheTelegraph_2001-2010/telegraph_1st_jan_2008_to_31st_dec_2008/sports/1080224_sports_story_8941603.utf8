The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag tipped to replace Praveen at the SCG
                                                   Sehwag tipped to replace Praveen at the SCG
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sydney: India are hoping to win their penultimate league match against Australia on Sunday and confirm a place in the finals of the tri-series. With a view to strengthening their batting, there is talk that Virender Sehwag could take Praveen Kumars place.         
	Batting remains the main concern for both the teams with majority of their famed batsmen struggling for consistency.         
	A win on Sunday will almost certainly reduce their game against Sri Lanka on Tuesday to academic interest.         
	Its very important to win the game tomorrow and seal the spot. It will take a bit of pressure off the players ahead of the last game. That also gives us the liberty to play other batsmen who may be in good nick but havent got a chance to play so far, said Mahendra Singh Dhoni as they prepared to take the world champions on the slow SCG track.         
	Australia have already secured their place in the final, collecting 22 points from six games. India, on 12 points, have a six-point lead over their sub-continent rivals with one round to go.         
	Sri Lanka need to win both their remaining matches and at the same time hope that India lose theirs to go through to the finals.         
	Sehwags return will mean India discarding their preference for five bowlers. They would revert to four frontline bowlers and expect the fifth bowlers quota to be shared by Sachin Tendulkar, Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh.         
	It is likely that Brett Lee will be back in the side on Sunday.         
	TEAMS         
	India (from): Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Robin Uthappa, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Munaf Patel, Praveen Kumar.         
	Australia (likely): Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Michael Clarke, Mike Hussey, Andrew Symonds, James Hopes, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Nathan Bracken.         
	Match starts: 8.45 am (IST)

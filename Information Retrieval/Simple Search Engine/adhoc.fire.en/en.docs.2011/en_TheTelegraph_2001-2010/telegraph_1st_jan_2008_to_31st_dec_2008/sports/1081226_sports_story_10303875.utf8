The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Age no obstacle for Vijai 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Age no obstacle for Vijai 
            LARRY DORMAN                                           Vijai Singh          
	Thousand Oaks (California): If what Vijai Singh did during the 2008 season  three victories, the FedEx Cup championship and the money title  was not proof enough that experience and persistence could still trump youth and power in professional golf, he provided some more at the Sherwood Country Club.         
	With the stage set for a final-round duel of the 20-somethings in the Chevron World Challenge, the 45-year-old Singh birdied the final hole for a closing five-under-par 67 and a one-stroke victory over Steve Stricker in the $5.75 million event.         
	Because the event, which benefits the Tiger Woods Foundation, is not an official PGA Tour tournament, the win does not add to Singhs astounding total of 22 tournament victories since turning 40. But it further proves his ability to compete at the highest level at an age once considered too advanced to do so.         
	Anthony, Camilo and Adam Scott, theres quite a few young guys, and theyre not going to stop, said Singh, whose score of 11-under-par 277 was tied for the highest winning total in the events 10-year history. The new wave of players will be stronger and better.         
	I dont know if I can keep doing this for another four, five, six years, but Im going to try.         
	Kim, who had the largest contingent of fans, might have been trying too hard to entertain them. On the final 10 holes, he had more highs and lows than a weather map. He holed a lob wedge shot for birdie at the ninth to tie for the lead, saved par at the 10th after his second shot airmailed the green, then killed his chances with back-to-back double bogeys at the 14th and 15th after moving a stroke from the lead. His consecutive birdies at the 16th and 17th were too late.         
	Singh will take away another validation that his workout regimen and ball-beating practice sessions  though not as lengthy as they once were  are keeping him and his considerable game tuned up enough to take on players half his age.         
	Theres no age limit, I dont think, Singh said. Winning this many tournaments doesnt mean its a miracle.         
	I think there will be guys out there who are going to do the same thing. Its just how many theyre going to win. Right now, Im the leader, and Im not quitting yet.

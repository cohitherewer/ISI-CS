	New Delhi: Pakistan has produced many a legendary pacer but according to Shoaib Akhtar the pace-mine has delivered its last diamond in him as he does not see any natural pacer emerging in his country after him.         
	The beleaguered fast bowler said Pakistan had given the world cricket great pacers in all these years but he fears the time has come to see a full stop.         
	Apart from Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis there have been many fast bowlers previously. But how many diamonds can you retrieve from one single mine, there has to be an end somewhere. I feel that I dont see any natural fast bowler after me, Akhtar told a television channel.         
	Akhtar, who left his job with Pakistan International Airlines to pursue his cricketing dreams, said his quest of creating a distinct identity for himself was instrumental in his becoming the fastest bowler in the world.         
	I have always believed that I should do something that will give me a distinct identity. I used to feel that I could become a faster bowler than Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. Maybe not a better bowler, but faster, yes. I had made up my mind that I would bowl the fastest ball in the 1999 World Cup, he said.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Muralidharan                           
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) pulled off a coup of sorts by roping in Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan for their forthcoming Ranji Trophy Plate group matches.         
	The Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has already given Test crickets highest wicket-taker the no objection certificate to play for Bengal.         
	The Lankan board chief executive, Duleep Mendis, has sent across a fax to us, mentioning that Murali will be available for Bengal in the upcoming first-class engagements, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya said.         
	Murali is now available to play for Bengal during the period. With his experience of 756 Test and 479 ODI wickets, Bengal cricket will benefit immensely. Further details of his availability will be known later, he added.         
	Mohinder Amarnath, who has already taken charge as consultant, recently stressed on the need to have a quality spinner in the side. The CAB president personally spoke to SLC officials and also got the necessary green signal from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	It is learnt that Murali will play around four matches in the knockout phase and will be paid on a match basis.         
	It will be decided according to the needs of the team. Its a costly affair was all Dalmiya said.         
	The arrangement is clear His obligations to the Lanka board will always come first.         
	Murali has not been included in Sri Lankas next international assignment  a four-nation Twenty20 tournament in Canada next month. The team has no other tours confirmed during the winter, but Muralis IPL team, Chennai Super Kings, will be taking part in the inaugural Champions Twenty20 League from December 3-10.         
	The BCCI has fixed Wednesday as the deadline for each state association to register one foreign cricketer for the 2008-09 season.         
	The Sunil Gavaskar-headed technical committee on August 30 decided to allow each association to select a maximum of four outstation players  one of which can be a foreigner  in their squads.         
	Bengal open their Plate league campaign against Assam in Guwahati on November 3. They will play five games in the league phase.         
	Bengal have also decided to retain Laxmi Ratan Shukla as captain for the season. While Sourav Ganguly has confirmed his availability, he has turned down a request from the CAB to lead the side.         
	The CAB president also made it clear that national selector Raja Venkat would not be co-opted into the state selection panel.

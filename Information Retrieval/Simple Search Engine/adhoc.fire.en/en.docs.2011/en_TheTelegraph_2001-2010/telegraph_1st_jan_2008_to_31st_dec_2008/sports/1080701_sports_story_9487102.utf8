The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Xavi named best
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Xavi named best
                  Xavi Hernandez                     
	Vienna: Uefa voted Xavi Hernandez player of the tournament after Spains 1-0 victory over Germany in the European Championship final and selected nine of the Spanish players in the 23-member team of Euro 2008.         
	There was no place in the squad for Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese star who scored 43 goals for Manchester United last season and is a leading candidate for Fifa player of the year, after he failed to reproduce his best form.         
	Andy Roxburgh, the former Scotland coach who is head of Uefas technical committee, said that Spains superior technical ability at the June 7-29 championship had earned the title for Luis Aragones team.         
	We have chosen Xavi because he epitomises the Spanish style of play. He was extremely influential in the whole possession, passing and penetrating kind of game that Spain played, Roxburgh said on Monday.         
	Explaining Ronaldos absence, Roxburgh said he was a member of an impressive Portugal team which reached the quarter finals, but then went out 3-2 to Germany. Ronaldo could have been included if the team had made it to the semi-finals and he had played well.

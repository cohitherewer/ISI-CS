	London: All that the Champions League aspired to be is encapsulated by Group B this season with Italian champions Inter Milan and Cypriot outsiders Anorthosis Famagusta seeking to progress with a game to spare.         
	Inter host Panathinaikos on Wednesday and will progress with a win or draw against the side they beat 2-0 in Athens in September.         
	Inter would have been through already had they beaten Anorthosis. But the Cypriots drew 3-3, could have won and are unbeaten at home in Europe for eight games.         
	Anorthosis host Werder Bremen and a home win could be enough to secure an unlikely slot in the last 16.         
	They look set to be without first choice goalkeeper Arian Beqaj. Zoltan Nagy is standing by for a first Champions League start.         
	Group C is already settled with Barcelona and Sporting through while Juventus, who have already beaten Real Madrid home and away, have also qualified from Group H.         
	The Spaniards are still second, though, and would secure a slot in the knockout phase with a win at Bate Borisov if Zenit St Petersburg fail to beat Juventus. Atletico Madrid and Liverpool have eight points at the top of Group D and will advance with at least a point at home to PSV Eindhoven and Olympique Marseille respectively.         
	It is a similar situation in Group F where Olympique Lyon and Bayern Munich have eight points.         
	Holders Manchester United and Villarreal, who meet in Spain in Group E on Tuesday, also have eight points and a draw, which would probably suit both coaches, will put both teams through and eliminate Celtic and Aalborg, who meet in Denmark.         
	Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo has flown to Spain for Tuesdays Champions League match against Villarreal despite limping out of Saturdays goalless draw with Aston Villa.         
	A statement on the Premier League champions website said Ronaldo had trained well on Monday morning after sustaining a leg injury and joined the 20-man squad for the flight to Spain.         
	However United said Gary Neville, Dimitar Berbatov, Edwin Van der Sar and Danny Welbeck would play no part in Tuesdays match.         
	Midfielder Paul Scholes, who has suffered knee ligament damage, trained on Monday but is not yet ready to play.         
	AS Romas 3-1 victory over Chelsea in the last round of games has opened up group A but last seasons runners up still lead the way and will go through with a win at Girondins Bordeaux. Roma visit CFR Cluj, who with four points are still in with an outside chance of progressing.         
	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger would gain some much-needed relief with a home win over Dynamo Kiev which would send them through with a game to spare from Group G.         
	Second-placed Porto could join them with a win at Fenerbahce. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Turkey look to avoid tie-break 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Turkey look to avoid tie-break

	Geneva: Turkey and the Czech Republic could face a penalty shootout on Sunday to qualify for a Euro 2008 quarter final clash against Croatia although both sides are determined to avoid relying on the lottery of spot kicks.         
	Under a new system introduced by tournament organisers Uefa at these finals, if the pair draw their group A match at the Stade de Geneve there will be a shootout after 90 minutes to decide who qualifies as runners-up behind Portugal.         
	The new regulation states that if two teams playing each other in the final round of group matches draw their game and are level on points, goal difference and goals scored, then their finishing position will be decided by spot kicks.         
	We will try everything to make sure the match doesnt go to penalties, Turkey goalkeeper Volkan Demirel said at a news conference on Friday.         
	Volkans teammate Arda Turan said the squad had every confidence in their goalkeeper if the scores were tied at the end of the match.         
	We all trust him to do what it takes, he told reporters at the teams training base in Nyon.         
	Czech Republic have been in three shootouts at major championships, winning every one and scoring all 20 spot kicks. Turkey have never been in a shootout at a major tournament.

	Salt Lake City: David Beckham got his famous bend back on Saturday to give the England International his first two-goal game in Major League Soccer. Beckham scored twice with trademark long-range curving kicks as the Los Angeles Galaxy came from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Real Salt Lake.         
	He had worked on his kicks several times last week because he had been off target too often. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it dont. Tonight they did, he said.         
	The first was from about 25 yards, as Beckham took a bouncing pass and had enough time to control the ball and curve a shot past the defence and Salt Lake goalkeeper Nick Rimando inside the far post.         
	The second goal didnt have quite the arc of the first, but thrilled fans just as much because they could see it coming. The Galaxy got a free kick from 29 yards out in the middle of the field, and Beckham bent it inside the left post and past Rimando, who once again couldnt dive quite far enough to stop it. Rimando later did save Salt Lake a point when he stopped Landon Donovans point-blank header.         
	It was obviously my turn to score the goals tonight instead of Landon, Beckham said.         
	Fabian Espindola and Kenny Deuchar scored early in the first half for Real Salt Lake.         
	Beckham scored in the 36th minute and 40th minute, tying the game after Real had taken a 2-0 lead. He came close to a third goal, but got upended before he could get off a shot in the second half, which the Galaxy controlled.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Steyn bowls SA closer to history
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Steyn bowls SA closer to history
  - Ponting hits valiant 99 
  -   Visitors need 153 more to win series         Simon Briggs            Dale Steyn bowled a superb spell                                 
	Melbourne: South Africa stand on the verge of a historic achievement at the MCG. Needing just 153 more runs to take this second Test, they are now strong favourites to become the first touring team to win a series in Australia since Richie Richardsons the West Indians of 1992-93.         
	After their 2-1 triumph in England last summer, Graeme Smiths men have already gone a long way to shrugging off their long-held reputation as chokers. If they can complete this run-chase  and so become the first South African side ever to win a series in Australia  that stereotype will have to be junked.         
	The success of Smiths regime is based on playing the percentages. There is something almost mechanical about the way South Africa eschew risky shots, forcing their opponents to spend long hours in the field. Australia, by contrast, batted like big-shot charlies on Monday as their second innings subsided to 247 all out.         
	The pattern of the day was set early on, when Matthew Hayden tried to blaze his way out of his form slump. He strong-armed a couple of trademark drives to the boundary, but a third attempt at intimidatory batting landed in the hands of short cover. The selectors will now have to decide whether         
	Hayden, who has just 110 runs from nine innings this Australian summer, is worth his place at Sydney.         
	By the close of play, perhaps only Mike Hussey  who was given out caught off his helmet  could claim that he had not contributed to his own dismissal. Simon Katich, Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin all fell chasing wide balls, while Andrew Symonds offered an indeterminate poke at a pitched-up outswinger.         
	The Aussies like to keep the scoreboard moving, so you have always got a chance against them, said South Africas spearhead Dale Steyn. If you can build up enough pressure, a bad shot will come along. I was gifted Michael Clarkes wicket today: it was a bad ball which he hit straight to cover.         
	South Africa would have been spraying the victory champagne Monday night had it not been for Ricky Ponting, who gave another convincing impersonation of the boy on the burning deck. As in the first innings, Ponting was a class above his teammates, driving fluently off the front-foot and crunching the occasional flick-pull whenever Morne Morkel dropped short.         
	Ponting had moved to 99 when Morkel cleverly held one back a little, enticing him into a Hayden-esque drive to short cover.         
	That extra run would have made Ponting the first man to score twin hundreds in four separate Test matches. Even so, this was still an extraordinary performance from the worlds best batsman, who continues to bat like Bradman in the face of his teams decline.         
	If Ponting was Australias lone star, Steyn took the strain for South Africa. Finding the swing that had eluded him in Perth, he maintained a teasingly full length and drew batsman after batsman into unwary drives. His figures of five for 67 came on top of the five for 87 he took in the first innings, not to mention the momentum-shifting 76 he made with the bat. The man of the match adjudicator might as well take the rest of the Test off.         
	Morkel also produced his best spells of the series in what was a superbly disciplined bowling effort from South Africa.         
	They have a very different method to the great Australian teams of recent years. Where the likes of Shane Warne and Adam Gilchrist believed in outrageous self-expression, and had the talent to pull it off, Smiths men play to a pattern and aim for total consistency.         
	A 3-0 sweep in this series would take South Africa to the top of the world rankings. And on the evidence of this match, they are only getting stronger. It sends out a scary signal to your rivals when you can whistle up a batsman as injury cover and find one as good as JP Duminy.         
	Australia went out with six overs to bowl at the end of the day, whereupon Ponting took a risk by handing Brett Lee the new ball. Lees landing foot is badly swollen, and on the verge of suffering a stress fracture, but he showed great courage by sprinting in and lifting the speed gun well over 90mph.         
	Sadly for Australia, Lees ill-fortune in this series continued as he clean-bowled Neil McKenzie with a no-ball, delivered just a couple of centimetres beyond the line. That wicket could have given Australia a much-needed boost, but instead the tourists continued to dominate as Smith produced some withering cut shots. South Africa were 30 for no wicket at stumps.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

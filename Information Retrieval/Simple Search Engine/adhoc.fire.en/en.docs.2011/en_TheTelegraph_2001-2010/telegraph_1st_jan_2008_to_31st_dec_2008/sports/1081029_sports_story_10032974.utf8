	New Delhi: India captain Anil Kumble has little doubt that India will be able to wrap up the series against Australia when the Third Test begins at the Kotla on Wednesday.         
	Addressing the media at the end of Tuesdays practice session, Kumble said the focus of his team was on playing good cricket to win the series.         
	I think we have played good cricket to get where we are before the start of this match, Kumble said.         
	As far as cricket is concerned, we have done all the good things and we are focussing on playing good cricket here so that we can beat them and win the series, he added.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On his own fitness         
	Im 100 per cent fit. Well just announce the first 12, its the same 11 as the last game and I come in.         
	The pitch         
	The Kotla wicket looks a good batting surface. I think at the end of the day its important to get the runs on the board, put pressure and get 20 wickets. I think we have the combination to do that and wed like to ensure that we get a good result here so that the series is decided and thats our approach to get a win here...         
	On playing at the Kotla         
	As a team we have some fantastic memories of Kotla and as an individual also I have achieved some personal landmarks here which I can never forget. All of us are looking forward to play the Test match at the Kotla.         
	The criticism regarding his form         
	People have their own opinions and I respect them. But if you start thinking about all that and play according to peoples opinion, you are never going to go anywhere. I have full faith in myself and the team have the confidence in me and I have confidence in my team to go there and perform.         
	The performance of the Indian openers         
	They have done a fantastic job in the series. Both Viru (Virender Sehwag) and Gautam (Gambhir) are in great form and we expect them to give us a flying start again. It happened in Mohali and we are hoping that they will score big hundreds at their home ground.         
	On the toss         
	Im not too worried about the toss. Of course the toss is important in Indian conditions but at the Kotla, it hardly matters. This is something which we dont have in our control.         
	The break between the two Test matches         
	Break is always good and I dont think there is any problem with breaks. People might look at it differently but for us those three days were important. We went back home and then we focussed on our preparations for the last three days leading to this Test match. Everyone is satisfied with the way we have prepared. The confidence we have gained in the last two Test matches has also helped us.         
	How are things going?         
	Fine. I wish all of you a happy Diwali.         
	Will Harbhajan Singh play?         
	Harbhajan is still not sure for the match. We just want to wait and see and depending on his fitness, we will take a final call on Wednesday.         
	Can Harbhajan be fit by the morning?         
	I hope he gets fit by the morning. Its a question of keeping the balance and obviously Harbhajan is a key member of the side and we are hoping he would be fit by Wednesday morning.         
	Harbhajan hardly bowled at the nets today         
	The number of balls or deliveries he bowls in the net is not the indication of whether he is fit or not. People try to assess somebodys fitness based on whether he bowls in the nets or not. The amount of cricket we play, its not important to bowl in the net to say he is okay. He still has a little bit of discomfort and at the end of the day, we still have some more time and as I mentioned he is a key member of our success and we would like to assess and give him the maximum time to take the call.

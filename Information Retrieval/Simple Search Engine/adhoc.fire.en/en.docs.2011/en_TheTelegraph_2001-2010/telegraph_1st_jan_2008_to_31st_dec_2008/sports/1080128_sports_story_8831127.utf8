The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gilchrist has changed face of the game, says Boucher
                                                Gilchrist has changed face of the game, says Boucher
                            
	Melbourne: South African Mark Boucher, who saw his world record of most dismissals by a stumper being snatched away by Adam Gilchrist, said the Australian had revolutionised the game.         
	The night before I had sent him a text message after he went past me on the (Test dismissals) list, saying, Congratulations on an incredible career, long may it continue. Boucher told a newspaper.         
	There have probably been better wicketkeepers in the game, but he revolutionised the game in terms of being a wicketkeeper-batsman, Boucher said.         
	Before he came into the game, it was okay for a keeper to be averaging between 20 and 25 if he was doing a good job with the gloves. But Gilly came in and set new standards for all of us to follow. Like Jonty Rhodes changed the face of fielding, Gilly changed the role of keeper-batsmen, he added.         
	Boucher also felt that Gilchrists legacy would stand the game in good stead.         
	Everyone would like to be like Adam Gilchrist, and turn games around by smashing the ball to all parts of the ground. There will be a lot of juniors all over the world coming into the game trying to emulate the way he has played, and that can only be a good thing, Boucher added.         
	Australias former coach John Buchanan reckons Gilchrists exit might prove a bigger loss for the team than the retirement of bowling greats Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath.         
	Former captain Steve Waugh also praised him. As my vice-captain of many years, he was often my eyes and ears and provided a conduit between players on issues in and around the side. He was a man I trusted 100 per cent and I always valued his insight and intuition during a match, Steve wrote in his column for The Daily Telegraph.         
	He was the complete package, a once-in-a-generation genius, and I feel privileged to have stood alongside him many times as our national anthem played, Steve wrote.

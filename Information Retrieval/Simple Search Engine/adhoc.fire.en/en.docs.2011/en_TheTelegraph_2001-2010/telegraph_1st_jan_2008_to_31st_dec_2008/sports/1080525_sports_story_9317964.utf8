The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal tied 43rd
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal tied 43rd
                      
	Woodmore (US): Arjun Atwal brought home a card of one-under 71 which had him tied 43rd in the $ 650,000 Melwood Prince Georges County Open .         
	The Orlando-based Indian, after his level par opening round, had a poor start and by the time he approached the fourth hole, he was two-over.         
	He then, fired an eagle on the par-five sixth hole and picked up two more shots on his way back, while dropping a bogey as well, to finish with a 36-hole total of one-under 143.         
	Meanwhile, in Virginia Water, Jyoti Randhawa raised his game just in time to hang around for a weekend action but the Indian threesome of S.S.P Chowrasia, Shiv Kapur and Jeev Milkha Singh fell by the wayside after their wayward second rounds in the BMW PGA championship.         
	Randhawas hugely improved second round of four-under 68 took his two-day total to three-under 141 and placed him tied 20th, also keeping him in the hunt for a decent finish.         
	 None of his compatriots, however, were equally lucky.         
	Overnight tied 12th, Chowrasia had a nightmarish second round of five-over 77 and his aggregate of three-over 147 was not enough to prolong his stay.         
	Overnight tied 26th, Shiv Kapur (147), too looked primed for a string finish before everything went haywire for the Delhi lad, who returned a card of four-over 76. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mourinho tipped for Inter job
                                                   Mourinho tipped for Inter job
                      
	Milan: Former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho has been installed as the Italian medias favourite for the Inter Milan job after Roberto Mancinis announcement that he was leaving at the end of season.         
	Earlier this term Italian media reports said Inter owner Massimo Moratti had held informal talks with Mourinho but the club and the Portuguese denied it.         
	Mourinho, who left Chelsea in September, did say he admired Moratti for his work at the Italian champions.         
	I respect him very much as a person that loves football and his club deeply, Mourinho told an Italian sports daily last week. However, I have never talked with him.         
	Mancini announced his decision after Tuesdays Champions League last 16 defeat.         
	The 43-year-old gave no reason, only adding that he had informed his players. Media reports said Mancini also indicated he would not manage in Italy again.         
	However, Inters Esteban Cambiasso has cast doubt on the announcement despite Mancini sounding definite. As far as I know, he said probably, so theres no need for reactions or comments in the heat of the moment, he said.         
	The coach said his decision was not because of the Liverpool defeat and media reports could only speculate about why he should want to walk away with a four-year contract remaining and Inter six points clear in Serie A.

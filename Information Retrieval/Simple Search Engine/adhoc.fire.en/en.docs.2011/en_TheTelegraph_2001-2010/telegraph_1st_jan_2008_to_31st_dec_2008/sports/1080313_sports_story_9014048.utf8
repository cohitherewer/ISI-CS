	Bangalore: The Bangalore Derby, which was cancelled following a strike by trainers on January 26 will not be re-scheduled as was rumoured in the racing circles, according to a senior Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) official.           
	The BTC stewards had taken the hard stand, about the cancellation of the Derby, after weighing all pros and cons. Their decision had shocked the trainers community which, came to terms soon after. Also, an assurance by the BTC stewards to the trainers that their grievances would be look into had paved the way for the smooth functioning of the BTC affairs. However, at no time stewards had promised the aggrieved lot that the Derby field will be re-framed.          
	Although some of the club members were in favour of re-scheduling the blue riband event, the majority of them were against such an idea, said Nirmal Prasad, secretary BTC, when contacted on Wednesday. Traditionally races once cancelled have never been re-framed, Prasad added.           
	It was the first time in the Indian horseracing history that a prestigious event like Derby was cancelled owing to trainers strike.

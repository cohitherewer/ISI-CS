The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Want to play till 2011 World Cup: Murali
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Want to play till 2011 World Cup: Murali
            A CORRESPONDENT            Anil Kumble in Colombo on Saturday                           
	Colombo: Between them, Muttiah Muralidharan (11) and Ajantha Mendis (8) took 19 wickets to send India crashing to their third heaviest Test defeat at the SSC in Colombo. While veteran Muralidharan wants to be around till the 2011 World Cup, for debutant Mendis its just a fantastic moment. This is what came up when both players appeared for the post-match news conference.               
	The following is what Muttiah Muralidharan had to say:         
	On his performance in this match         
	Last time we faced India in a Test, in that team (2001-02 at home) Sachin and Laxman werent there. I got eight wickets in the first innings and we won that match. I remember we scored 600 runs in the first innings. But this one was different because two spinners were bowling in tandem and ended up sharing 19 wickets Its more satisfying for us spinners because the wicket was a very good one. We scored a good 600 runs Our players played cautiously at the start and then went on the attack. Anil (Kumble) and Harbhajan (Singh) are dangerous, so we had our plans and played accordingly. Once you have 600 runs, following on was always going to be tough. Ajantha (Mendis) is a very talented bowler. Since we bowled very tightly, the batsman had to do something to get the runs. They committed mistakes and we capitalised on those.         
	On Ajantha Mendis         
	He is the most talented of the lot. When I started, I had just the off-spin Though I had a bigger turn. He has more variations. Thats difficult for the batsmen. If he keeps his head and keeps performing this way, he will definitely take a lot of wickets in international cricket.         
	On getting Sachins wicket         
	I bowled very well to him kept up the pressure and both times he played false shots. Thats what happens when there is pressure from both ends and wickets are falling. We have also been in that situation in the past. It happens to every cricketer in the world, including the best. We are all human.         
	On what keeps him going         
	Hunger for wickets and for financial reasons. We all need to be financially well looked after. No other job can be more beneficial than playing for Sri Lanka. Those two things, and my love of the game. If somebody says I dont play for financial gains, only for the love of the game, it is a definite lie.         
	The following is what Ajantha Mendis had to say:         
	On his fantastic debut         
	It was obviously a fantastic moment for me. To bowl alongside Murali helped me a lot, especially to get his advice all along the way. The pressure that he created gave me opportunities to pick up wickets. I am very happy with my start to international cricket.         
	On how Indian batsmen played him         
	Everyone played me well. The important thing was that we bowled in good areas and created pressure.         
	On whose wicket gave him most satisfaction         
	Its got to be Rahul Dravids wicket in the first innings.         
	How was it like playing for Sri Lanka         
	I had the senior players helping me around Especially Murali bowling from the other end and the advice that he gave me. I didnt feel the nerves because it was just another game for me.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its a double loss for South Africa
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its a double loss for South Africa
    - In Natal, the selectors picked bodi and not Pietersen             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kevin Pietersen                                 
	Calcutta: Irrespective of the result of the Test series and his own form, Kevin Pietersens leadership in the lead-up to the ongoing tour by England has assured a special place for him when one lists impact-creating captains, on and off the field, of the present times.         
	Graeme Smith has been doing a fine job, but it has actually been a double loss for South Africa, where Pietersen was born (in Pietermaritzburg, near Durban) 28 years ago.         
	The Proteas have lost a terrific batsman, one who loves to break with convention, and somebody with excellent leadership qualities.         
	Had the KwaZulu-Natal selectors not ignored Pietersen and shown a preference for left-arm spinner Goolam Bodi, in the late 1990s, the England captain could well have been with Smith and Co. in Australia instead of sweating it out in Chennai.         
	No number was specified, but the provinces couldnt field an all-Whites team... Pietersen was then seen more as an off-spinner and, for whatever reason, the KwaZulu-Natal selectors gave more opportunities to Bodi... That made Pietersen unhappy and he moved to England, former South Africa captain and Board supremo Dr Ali Bacher told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Johannesburg, he added: Thats the time the Affirmative Action Policy was being followed, across society, in South Africa... Of late, however, intention is the operative word... Nobody doubts Pietersens class as a batsman, but his anti-South Africa comments havent made him popular in the country of his birth... Of late, one has heard and read less of that, probably because the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has had a word with Pietersen...         
	Of course, as somebody who has been associated with cricket in the country, I do take pride that Pietersen learnt his basics in South Africa... I have no hesitation in placing that on record.         
	[Pietersen qualified for England, after waiting for the mandatory period, as his mother Penny is English. He began by turning out for Notts, but has since moved to Hants.]         
	Asked whether hed been impressed with Pietersens off the field leadership, specifically being able to convince the Andrew Flintoffs not to withdraw from the tour, Dr Bacher said: Sure, he had a role... But its the entire team which needs to be complimented... The ECB as well.         
	Pietersen, one learns, engaged in quiet diplomacy, the kind which would make the Foreign Office proud.         
	As somebody in the know put it: Pietersen passed the word around that hed love to have everybody with him on the tour, but wouldnt force anybody to return to India (after the terror strikes in Mumbai)... Another point he made was that absolutely nothing would be held against anybody if X or Y decided to opt out owing to misgivings over security... His strategy worked...         
	Flintoff had the strongest reservations, initially, and in the same boat was his best buddy, Steve Harmison. Once Flintoff was convinced that a stand had to be taken by seniors such as him and a message conveyed to the Mohammed Ajmals, Harmison too decided not to withdraw.         
	Pietersen gave everybody space... He made his feelings clear, about supporting Indian cricket, but didnt seek to impose them... It was quiet diplomacy... Good leadership... Much, clearly, was done behind the scenes, the gentleman in the know pointed out.         
	Kudos to Pietersen.

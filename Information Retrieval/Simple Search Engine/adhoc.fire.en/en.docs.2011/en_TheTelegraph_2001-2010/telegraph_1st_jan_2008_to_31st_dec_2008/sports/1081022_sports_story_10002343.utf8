The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aguero unlikely to start vs Reds
                                                                                                                                                                                             Aguero unlikely to start vs Reds
  - AS Roma face tough away tie against Chelsea             Rafael Benitez                           
	Madrid: Three consecutive defeats by direct rivals in the Primera Liga has left Atletico Madrid coach Javier Aguirre under pressure to get a good result against Liverpool at home in the Champions League on Wednesday.         
	Atletico top Group D with six points from two games, but even that achievement has lost some of its shine after the crowd trouble that marred their opening home game against Olympique Marseille.         
	Atletico have lost Czech Republic defender Tomas Ujfalusi to injury and are likely to field a number of squad players ahead of next weekends trip to face Villarreal in the league. Weary Argentina striker Sergio Aguero could start on the bench.         
	In contrast, Liverpool arrive full of confidence despite the absence of injured striker Fernando Torres, who misses the chance to return to his former home where he is still idolised by the fans.         
	Benitez will have one eye on Sundays league clash at Chelsea and, with six points already in the bag, could give a starting place to several squad players.         
	Meanwhile, Chelsea have another chance to show off their new expansive style on Wednesday when AS Roma visit Stamford Bridge.         
	With Roma having already lost to Cluj, Chelsea can take command of their destiny with victory against the Italians who are smarting from a 0-4 thumping by Inter Milan at the weekend and who have bad memories of recent trips to England.         
	Chelsea could have Petr Cech back in goal after he missed the Middlesbrough match with a leg injury while midfielder Joe Cole may also return. (Agencies)

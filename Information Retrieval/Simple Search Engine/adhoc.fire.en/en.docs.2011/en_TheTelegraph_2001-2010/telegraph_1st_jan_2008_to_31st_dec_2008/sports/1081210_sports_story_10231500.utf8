The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United bank on Arsenal

	Sir Alex Ferguson claims Arsene Wenger holds the key to Manchester Uniteds challenge for a hattrick of Premier League titles.         
	United, who can seal top spot in their Champions League group with a win against Danish champions Aalborg at Old Trafford on Wednesday, are six points off the pace in the title race, albeit with a game in hand.         
	Defeats at Liverpool and Arsenal, plus frustrating draws at Everton, Chelsea and Aston Villa, have left United with little room for error in the second half of the season and Fergusons men face a trip to in-form Spurs on Saturday before jetting out to Japan for the Fifa Club World Cup.         
	With their trip to the Far East forcing the postponement of the league game against Wigan (rearranged for January 14), United could fall even further behind the leaders before they return ahead of the Boxing Day trip to Stoke.         
	Ferguson is confident that his players can make up the points deficit in the new year, however, and he insists that Arsenal could play a pivotal role in deciding the outcome of the title race with Wengers team still to face Liverpool and Chelsea at the Emirates.         
	Ferguson said: This could be the tightest race in years and I expect the Big Four to take it right to the wire. In the past, it has always come down to two teams, but I dont think that will be the case this season.         
	The improvement by other teams has made it much harder to go away from home and pick up points. You saw evidence of that last season and its continued this year, even more so in fact  just look at the results Stoke and Hull enjoyed against Arsenal.                     
	We should have buried Arsenal with the chances we had in the first half. Thats football, but what we want now is for Arsenal to beat Liverpool and Chelsea. Theyve just won at Chelsea, but theyve still got to play them at home and theyve also got two games to play against Liverpool.         
	Our defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool were disappointing, but weve got the away games against our rivals out of the way and Im sure we can make up ground.         
	Ferguson will be anxious to win at Tottenham on Saturday and remain within touching distance of the leaders over the Christmas fixture period.         
	He admits that former Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp has made a huge difference at White Hart Lane. He said: Harrys obviously got great experience, but hes just used common sense. I heard him explaining how the training ground is a happy place, theres a good atmosphere in the dressing room and the players are enjoying themselves.         
	A happy dressing room means you get happy players and you can see that in the results theyve had.         
	United will travel to Japan without suspended Patrice Evra and Wayne Rooney and may also rest Cristiano Ronaldo who suffered a heavy bang on his hip on Saturday.

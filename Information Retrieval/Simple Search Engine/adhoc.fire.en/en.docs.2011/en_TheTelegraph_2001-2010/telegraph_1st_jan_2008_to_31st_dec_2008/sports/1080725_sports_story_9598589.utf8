The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India can match Lanka, says Kirsten
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India can match Lanka, says Kirsten
                      
	Colombo: With the Sri Lankan juggernaut showing no signs of slowing down, India coach Gary Kirsten now hopes to restrict the hosts within the 500-run mark and put up an equal display when his wards come to bat.         
	We will try to keep them under 500 and make sure that when we come out to bat, we display equally good batting, Kirsten said today after the seconds days play here at the Sinhalese Sports Club.         
	The wicket is good and we believe we can also score more than 500 runs, he added.         
	Captain Mahela Jayawardene, Malinda Warnapura and Thilan Samaraweera struck centuries as Sri Lanka posted a mammoth 422 for four.         
	The umpire referral system, which debuted in the match, has already been tested thrice so far, and Kirsten feels the new innovation is great for the game. (agencies)

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Murali is a chucker, insists Gilly
                      
	Sydney: Former Australia vice-captain Adam Gilchrist has called spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan a chucker and accused the Sri Lankan authorities of splitting the cricket world between white and black countries in the nineties.         
	Gilchrist, in his autobiography True Colours, has minced no words in saying Muralidharan chucks and alleged that the International Cricket Council (ICC) protected him after Sri Lankan board interpreted questioning of his bowling action as racial attack.         
	Does Murali chuck the ball? ... I thought for a few moments, and then said, cautiously: I think he does, Gilchrist said, referring to a question posed to him. Gilchrist lamented that the ICC changed the rules to accommodate Murali. (PTI)

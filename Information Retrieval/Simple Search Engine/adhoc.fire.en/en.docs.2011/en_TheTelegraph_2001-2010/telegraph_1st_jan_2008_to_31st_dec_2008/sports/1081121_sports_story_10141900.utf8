The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delayed start upsets Kevin
                                                                                                                                                                                           Delayed start upsets Kevin
                      
	Kanpur: Upset with the defeat against India via Duckworth-Lewis method in fading light, England captain Kevin Pietersen said the November 29 Guwahati tie might also see a similar end and the administrators need to make more common sense decisions to avoid such anti-climactic finishes.         
	Pietersen was particularly upset at the haze-delayed start to Thursdays match and felt the lunch break should have been truncated to get a full game.         
	Besides, he also wanted authorities to switch on the floodlights at the Green Park Stadium for a full game.         
	I knew when the decision (of delayed start) was made, there was no way the game would finish. We tried to get it sorted, we tried to get it turned around but we cannot go against the decision made by the hierarchy, a frustrated Pietersen said.         
	I think Guwahati is further north, north-east. Its an 8.30 start there but I think the sun goes down at three. Guwahati is worth trying a full game, he said, rather sarcastically.         
	Pietersens arguments, however, could not impress India coach Gary Kirsten, who said umpires could not have predicted a premature end and the Indian team had nothing to do with the entire issue.

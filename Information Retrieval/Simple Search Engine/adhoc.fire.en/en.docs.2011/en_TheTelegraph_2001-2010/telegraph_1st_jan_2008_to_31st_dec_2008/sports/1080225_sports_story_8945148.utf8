The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No excuses, says Gambhir
                                                   No excuses, says Gambhir
                      
	Sydney: Gautam Gambhir on Sunday hit his first ODI century against Australia, but the Delhi batsman rued not staying in the middle a little longer to guide his side to victory.         
	No excuses, I should have batted for a couple of overs more. I think we could have chased down the total, but Dhoni and I were out at the wrong time, said Gambhir, who hit a 119-ball 113.         
	If I had been there till the 44th over, the result could have been different, he added.         
	Gambhir said despite being were 51 for 4 at one time, they never panicked.         
	Dhoni and I thought we could chase down the total if we have wickets in hand. We thought we could bat cautiously for some time and shift gears in the last 10-12 overs if we have wickets.         
	I was a little tired and a bit cramped, but should have remained a little longer, said Gambhir, who has become the highest run-getter of the tri-series with 359 runs. (PTI)

	Churchill Brothers, who lost to Dempo 0-2 in the first leg, started on an aggressive note earning them the first scoring chance in the seventh minute but the Odafe Okolie shot hit the post.

But Climax Lawerence and Nicholau Borges were off the target, while Anthony Pereira saw his header going straight to keeper Vinay Singh. Finally, in the 45th minute Edeh Chiddi broke the deadlock diving forward to head in a Roberto Mendes Silva free kick.

    Arundel (England): The spectre of a series whitewash looms large over the Indian women rsquo;s cricket team which put up yet another pathetic batting show to concede its fourth straight defeat against England.
    After the lone Twenty20 match between the sides at Taunton was washed out, the fourth ODI here, too, was truncated to a 23-overs-a-side affair which saw the visitors hurtling to a seven-wicket defeat.
    Put into bat, Mithali Raj and her team-mates crawled to 90 for seven and despite Jhulan Goswami rsquo;s spell, Claire Taylor rsquo;s unbeaten 56 saw the hosts overhaul the target with five balls to spare, losing just three wickets.
    Opener Sulakshana Naik (28) and Jaya Sharma (13) gave India a steady, if not rollicking, start to put 27 runs before Isa Guha removed Jaya to draw first blood.
  England rsquo;s left-arm spinner Holly Colvin (3/17) then took over and ran through the Indian top order. 
    Brief scores: India 90/7 in 23 overs (S. Naik 28, J. Sharma 13; H. Colvin 3/17) lost to England 93/3 in 22.1 overs (C. Taylor 56 not out, C. Edwards 17)

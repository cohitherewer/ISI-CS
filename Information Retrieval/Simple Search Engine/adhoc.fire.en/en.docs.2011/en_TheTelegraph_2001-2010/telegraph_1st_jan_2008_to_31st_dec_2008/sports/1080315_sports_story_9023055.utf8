The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Men in red in league of their own
                                                   Men in red in league of their own
            Henry Winter                                Cesc Fabregas      
	The latest edition of Red Issue, the enjoyably splenetic Manchester United fanzine, features the usual knockabout mock-ups of a Kevin Keegan clock  the alarm bells are ringing, guaranteed sleepless nights  and a bespectacled Steven Gerrard in March 2018 musing on Liverpools title hopes  maybe next year.         
	Rather more seriously, United fans favoured reading matter focuses on where Cristiano Ronaldos future lies, mentioning his oft-expressed desire to play in Spain. The vaunted realms of Real Madrid or Barcelona and the sunnier climes of his native Iberian Peninsula would undoubtedly appeal to the Portugal international, particularly as he believes he is deliberately targeted by opponents in English football.         
	A word of advice: Now would be the worst time to quit the Premier League. Ronaldo will never find elsewhere the sort of loyal support he receives from United fans. He would also be leaping off the Premier League juggernaut just as it is threatening to crush Continental rivals and hit the front in the race for global acclaim. For once, all the hype about the worlds best league threatens to be true.         
	Ronaldo should look at the Champions League draw, which could produce an all-English final four. The last night of the Premier League proms could come in Moscow on May 21. The English are dominating the Champions League. Lofty Madrid are noticeable by their absence. Barcelona lack their usual touch of magic with Lionel Messi injured and Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry struggling to hit their breathtaking heights.                   Fernando Torres      
	In danger of becoming wallflowers at the European dance-hall they have so often ruled, the Italians send only one emissary, Roma, hardly the John Travoltas of the Beautiful Game. No AC Milan (expelled by Cesc Fabregas Arsenal). No Inter Milan (evicted by Fernando Torres Liverpool). No Juventus (embarrassed by a refereeing scandal). Serie A needs some time to lick its wounds.         
	While the Spanish and Italians draw breath, the English strike. The World Player of the Year, Milans Kaka cannot strut his marvellous talent on the European stage this season. So the Champions League cries out for new entertainers. Step forward Fabregas, Torres and Ronaldo.         
	The sight of two Spaniards and a Portuguese bearing the standard of the Premier League should shake the FA with all the clamour and clatter of a Keegan alarm clock, yet this crowd-pleasing trio should be cherished, particularly if native talent absorbs lessons.         
	Peter Crouch is as likely to become Torres as Robbie Williams is Placido Domingo, but Liverpools Englishman may acquire some hints in the striking arts simply through close proximity to the Spaniard. Ditto Theo Walcott at Arsenal by observing the hunger levels and class in the pass of Fabregas, Torres compatriot and Milans nemesis.         
	At United, Ronaldos sense of adventure, his high-speed appliance of skill to avoid a markers negative intent, and the sheer variety of his goals must serve as an inspiration to all those English prospects thrusting through the clubs Academy.         
	The myriad members of the Professional Footballers Association currently consider their vote for Player of the Year and foremost in their thoughts will be Ronaldo, Torres and Fabregas. Others deserve mention in despatches from Manchester Citys Martin Petrov to Portsmouths David James, Evertons Mikel Arteta to Aston Villas Gabby Agbonlahor and Tottenhams Robbie Keane, but the three wise men in red are in a league of their own.                   Cristiano Ronaldo      
	Torres makes a fascinating subject to observe. Watch him on the San Siro pitch against Inter, and he is devastatingly confident, collecting the ball and scoring a wonderful goal on Tuesday. Watch him in the airport a few hours later, quietly satisfying the hordes of autograph-hunters, and Torres seems genuinely shy, almost surprised by the interest in him. When set against his footballing expertise, Torres humility is even more admirable.         
	Torres is an unpretentious person off the field and ruthless matador on it. Few foreigners have settled so quickly, particularly now that Rafa Benitez has tempered his rotational urges. The striker will start and star in Europe.         
	So will Ronaldo for United. The winger has still to dominate a major club match with the authority he does for Portugal. His 2006 World Cup semi-final display against France, albeit fruitless, will linger long in the memory. But Ronaldo possesses all the attributes of pace and technique to shine in the Champions League.         
	Fabregas lacks the acceleration of Ronaldo and Torres but his passing injects speed into any attack. Arsenals playmaker has emerged from Henrys shadow, and his performance against Milan, culminating in a respectful embrace from Kaka, confirmed his class. Along with Ronaldo and Torres, Fabregas leads the charge for Champions League honours  and for PFA Player of the Year acclaim. The race for European Footballer of the Year may also become a red issue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blue beat Red by 49 runs
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Blue beat Red by 49 runs
                      
	Cuttack: The India Red middle-order crumbled at a time when they were looking to settle the issue, as India Blue, helped by a fine effort by off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, registered a 49-run win in the Challenger Series for NKP Salve Trophy at Barabati Stadium here on Thursday.         
	When it all seemed that the Red will score an easy win with Murali Vijay blazing all guns, off-spinner Ashwin brought in the turn around taking the wicket of his Tamil Nadu teammate.         
	Vijay showed that he is the newest kid on the block with a fine knock of 89. His 107 balls innings was studded with nine boundaries and two sixes.         
	With the national selectors Narendra Hirwani (Central), Surendra Bhave (West) and Raja Venkat (East)  watching from the pavilion end, Vijay completed his half-century with a towering six over mid-on. He did not stop there as the Tamil Nadu batsman followed it up with back-to-back boundaries as Siddharth Trivedi conceeded 14 runs in his sixth over. With 129 required from 26 overs, a visibly tense-looking Yuvraj Singh chose to give Trivedi a break and instead took the bowling responsibility in his hand.         
	But the duo of Manoj Tiwary and Vijay began to score important runs taking singles and doubles in the middle as they stitched 50 runs for the fifth wicket.         
	When it looked like the match is going to get over soon with runs flowing from Vijays blade, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin gave the breakthrough putting an end to the fifth wicket partnership that fetched India Red 78 runs.

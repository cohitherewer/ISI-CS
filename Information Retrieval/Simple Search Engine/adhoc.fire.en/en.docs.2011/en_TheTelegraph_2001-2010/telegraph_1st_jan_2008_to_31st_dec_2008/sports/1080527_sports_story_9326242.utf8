	Calcutta: A day after finishing their engagements in the Indian Premier League the Kolkata Knight Riders reviewed their performance.         
	Captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Buchanan were present while team owner Shah Rukh Khan joined them through a video conference from Mumbai.         
	We have learnt our lessons. We hope to make amends next year, Sourav said after the meeting. Now that we have played one season in the new format, next season we will play better, he added.         
	Buchanan said the meeting dwelt on areas where the Knight Riders had gone wrong. We will work on these areas. It has been a good learning experience for the players.         
	In another year, you will see them much more improved. Its been a learning experience for me too, he said.         
	It was learnt Buchanan might seek the services of a bowling coach next year.

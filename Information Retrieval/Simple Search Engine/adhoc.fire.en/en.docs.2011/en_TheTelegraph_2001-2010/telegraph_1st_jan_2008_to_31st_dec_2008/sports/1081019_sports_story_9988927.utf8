The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lorgat: ICC not to mediate
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lorgat: ICC not to mediate
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: The International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Haroon Lorgat on Saturday failed to shed any light on the ongoing tussle between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Indian Cricket League (ICL), and said the ICC had no plans of mediating on the issue.         
	Addressing the media here on the sidelines of the India-Australia Test, Lorgat said the ICC would act accordingly after receiving the report from the BCCI on the issue.         
	We are going through a process. I cant speculate on the outcome. We are waiting for the report from the BCCI and will act accordingly on the ICLs application for recognition, Lorgat quipped.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Premier Division of the Calcutta Football League enters the final phase on Thursday with Mohun Bagan taking on Calcutta Port Trust (CPT). The title race is wide open for the three city giants. CPT are placed fifth with 12 points from 10 games.         
	Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa is not taking any chances and has included Bhaichung Bhutia, who has recovered from the injury that had kept him away from the last couple of matches, in the squad. The India captain, however, may take the field only in the second half.         
	I am confident of wining the League. There are still three games to go and we are on top Everything is in our hands and we cannot afford to lose focus. Ive told the players to not worry about anything else and focus on their own game, said Bencharifa.         
	Im not thinking about the East Bengal or George Telegraph. We will put in our best efforts, he added.         
	The coach is also not willing to read much into their first leg draw with CPT. They are a good side It was unfortunate that despite playing well we dropped points in the first leg, the coach said.         
	Jose Ramirez Barreto, who celebrated his birthday on Wednesday, will start upfront. Ishfaq Ahmed, who like Bhutia hasnt played for the club this season, has also been included in the squad.

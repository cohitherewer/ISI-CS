                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ministry boost for IOA
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Two days after deposed IHF president KPS Gill tried to block the appointment of Pargat Singh as the manager of the Indian hockey team, the sports ministry made it clear that the IHF now has no say in matters pertaining to the game.         
	On Wednesday, Gill wrote to Pargats employers, Punjab Police, that he shouldnt be granted leave as his appointment was not cleared by the IHF. The letter initially created some confusion and Pargat had to convince his employers before he was cleared for the assignment.         
	On Friday, the new ad-hoc committee, headed by IOA president Suresh Kalmadi, received a shot in the arm when the sports ministry accepted its decision to disband the IHF.         
	IOA has informed us about the constitution of the ad-hoc. From now, we would communicate with the IOA only in all matters relating to Indian hockey, a source in the ministry said.

	Bangkok: Commonwealth Games gold medallist Akhil Kumar capped a remarkable comeback from a career threatening injury by becoming the second Indian boxer to qualify for Beijing Olympics through the Asian qualifying tournament here on Friday.
  
	The 27-year-old bantam weight pugilist, who was laid low by a wrist injury that took away more than half of his 2007 season, continued with his devastating form and advanced to the finals. Akhil out-scored his Korean opponent Ryom Chol Jin in the semi-final. Also an Asian Championship bronze medallist, Akhil will face Athens Olympics silver medallist Worapoj Petchkoom of Thailand in the final on Saturday.
  
	A.L. Lakra (57kg) is the only other Indian to have qualified for the Olympics so far .
    
	Sydney: An abrasive track made it a bumpy practice session for A1 Team India as Narain Karthikeyan drove them to an 18th-place finish ahead of the qualifying race here on Saturday. Indias rookie driver was unavailable this weekend for personal reasons, forcing Karthikeyan to take the Eastern Creek track to test the car ahead of the qualifying session. It was quite an eye opener for me. I have never raced on this track before. The surface was particularly bumpy and wore the tyres out very quickly. However, the car is looking good and I am expecting a top 10 qualifying position, Karthikeyan said. Team India was placed 18th in the second session with a lap time of 1:20.936 with a top speed of 262.1kph. 
    
	London: Williams halted a pre-season Formula One test at Barcelonas circuit de Catalunya on Friday after Japanese rookie Kazuki Nakajima crashed the teams new car into the barriers. Nakajima, who will be starting his first full season in Melbourne on March 16 after making a strong race debut in Brazil last October, was fine. Hes fine. It was related to a front wing mounting issue which will be fixed and the car will be running again on Saturday, a team spokesman said.
  
	Germanys Nico Rosberg, in the other Williams, had also been due to take part in the first day of the test but the crash forced a change of plan as the team checked his car for a similar problem.
    
	Madrid: Real Madrid centre back Christoph Metzelder may need surgery to resolve the problems he has been having with the sole of his foot and could be out for two months, coach Bernd Schuster said on Friday. Its bad news. Its a hard injury to recover from and he may need surgery. Hell be out for between six and eight weeks, Schuster said. I hope to have him back for the end of the season. Its a shame to lose him now. 
    
	Stockholm: Swedish former top 10 player Joachim Johansson announced his retirement from international competition on Friday at the age of just 25, citing his recurrent shoulder injuries as the reason. There is no other option than to quit, Johansson told a Swedish newspaper.
    
	Auckland: Olympic hockey regulars Argentina and New Zealand face a desperate last chance bid to reach Beijing in a winner-takes-all qualifying tournament starting here on Saturday. The two have the best credentials in the six-team tournament, having played in nine Olympics, with New Zealand the 1976 gold medallists, but both failed to secure a Beijing berth during the regular qualifying rounds.

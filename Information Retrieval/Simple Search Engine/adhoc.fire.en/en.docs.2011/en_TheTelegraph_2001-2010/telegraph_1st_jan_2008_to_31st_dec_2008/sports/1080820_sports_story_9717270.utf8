Usain Bolt on course | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Usain Bolt on course
                  Usain Bolt                     
	Beijing: Aided by the power of the local yam vegetable, according to his father, Jamaicas Usain Lightning Bolt breezed through another race, this time the 200 metres semi-final.         
	Bolt played for TV cameras at the block and eased up to take a sideways look at competitors before crossing the line first.         
	Thats just me, he said. I like to enjoy what I do.         
	Should he win Wednesdays final, following his world record-breaking 100m victory, Bolt will be the first man to win an Olympic double sprint since Americas Carl Lewis in 1984.         
	Next Olympics hosts Britain reached their highest gold medal tally in a century on Tuesday with four victories including one from a once-banned runner.         
	Christine Ohuruogu, who only made it to Beijing after winning an appeal against a lifetime Olympics ban, powered to gold in the womens 400m for Britains first athletics win in China.         
	Everyone always dreams about winning but you never think theres a reality to something you dream about, said the elated 24-year-old Londoner, who served a years suspension for missing three doping tests in 2006.         
	Other wins in cycling and sailing cemented Britains third place in China, with 16 golds the best since 1908 and the perfect way to fire up enthusiasm at home for the 2012 Games.         
	Hosts China are way ahead with 43 golds, their seemingly unassailable lead helping dull some of the national pain over the withdrawal through injury of track idol Liu Xiang.         
	The United States are second with 26 golds.         
	In the highest-profile race of Day 11, Rashid Ramzi gave Bahrain the first gold in their history in the mens 1,500 metres.         
	Perhaps the most moving story came from Germanys weightlifter Matthias Steiner, who won the super-heavyweight gold to lay claim to the title of worlds strongest man.         
	Choking back tears on the podium, Steiner, 25, held up and kissed a photo of his late wife, to whom he had promised Olympic success when she was dying after a car crash last year.         
	Im not the superstitious type, dont believe in higher powers, but I hope she saw me, he said after his win.         
	Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton won the mens and womens sprints, making it a remarkable eight Beijing golds on road and track for the new cycling superpower. In Qingdao, on the coast, another Briton, Paul Goodison, won the sailing Laser title.         
	Chinese leaders and people alike showered their injured Olympics 110m hurdles champion Liu with get-well messages a day after he limped forlornly off the track, depriving the hosts of what they hoped might be their greatest single moment of glory.         
	Liu, who along with basketball player Yao Ming is Chinas most idolised sportsman, surfaced on Tuesday, vowing not to quit.         
	Cuban 110m hurdles world record holder Dayron Robles blazed into the semi-finals and should win now Liu is out.         
	One man whose lungs definitely were not affected by any lingering smog was German triathlete Jan Frodeno. The 27-year-old outsider, who only took up triathlon to impress a girl, broke away from three of the sports biggest names at the end to win the swim-bike-run endurance test.         
	During the race I told myself: Boy, be greedy  its champagne or fizzy water, said the former lifeguard.                 (REUTERS)

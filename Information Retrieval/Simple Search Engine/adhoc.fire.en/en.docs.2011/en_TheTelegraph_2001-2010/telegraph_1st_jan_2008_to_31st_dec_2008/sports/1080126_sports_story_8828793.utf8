                                                   Djokovic pierces Federer defence

           
	Melbourne: Roger Federers invincibility was pierced, pummelled and finally pulled apart at Melbourne Park on Friday, the world No. 1 brutally ejected from the Australian Open semi-finals by Novak Djokovic. 
    
	The Swiss champion and top seed fell 5-7, 3-6, 6-7, ending his bid to reach an 11th consecutive Grand Slam final. Instead Djokovic will face muscular Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Sundays showpiece. 
    
	Of course, Ive created a monster, so I know I need to always win every tournament, Federer wearily told reporters. But semis is still, you know, pretty good. 
    
	Where third seed Djokovic was thunderous, Federer was ponderous. 
    
	Its unbelievable to beat the No. 1 player in the world, probably the best this court has seen, Djokovic beamed. 
    
	I was able to deal with the pressure in the best possible way. And if you do that against the best player in the world, you know, you should get the positive outcome. 
    
	This defeat was Federers first in straight sets at a Grand Slam since he lost to Gustavo Kuerten in the 2004 French Open. The holder of 12 Grand Slam crowns, his chase of Pete Samprass record 14 is now on ice until the French Open begins in May. 
    
	Djokovic was simply too strong, too steady. Where Federer inched past him in the last Grand Slam final at the US Open, the Serb was always a nose ahead this time. 
    
	Federer has failed to peak in Melbourne this year, his preparation hampered by a viral illness, and third seed Djokovic was more aggressive throughout. 
    
	Its very difficult to play against a player who is so dominant on any surface, Djokovic said. 
    
	He has been so successful in the last couple of years in Australia and he had the crowd behind him. I am amazed at the way I coped with the pressure. 
    
	Friday night marked Federers 15th straight appearance in a Grand Slam semi-final. Not once in those previous 14 has he put in such a low-key performance. 
    
	Seemingly distracted, slow off the mark and uncharacteristically cranky with the umpire he was there for the taking. It was the Swiss who grabbed the first break of the match but it was more a case of Djokovic needing to settle than Federers superiority. 
    
	From trailing 3-5, the Serb reeled off the next four games to clinch the set. 
    
	Djokovic broke for 3-1 in the second, chasing down a glanced backhand volley and flicking it down the line. He held a set point while leading 5-3 but Federer saved that with a rapier forehand down the line. Djokovic received a time warning but immediately crunched a forehand winner to bring up a second set point which he took with his fourth ace before glaring at the umpire. 
    
	Federer raced into three break points for a 2-0 lead in the third set but Djokovic saw them all off with mighty serving. Off the pace and frequently shanking shots, Federer looked in deep trouble but the pair were neck-and-neck throughout the third set. 
    
	Federer got a break point at 6-5 up but Djokovic held with a big serve to the backhand. The Swiss earned another a moment later with a piledriver forehand cross-court but again a big serve followed by a forehand winner saved the Serb. (Reuters)

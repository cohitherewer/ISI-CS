                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zidanes the best ever, says Beckham

	Madrid: Former England captain David Beckham on Sunday said that his ex-Real Madrid teammate Zinedine Zidane was the best player of all time.         
	The 33-year-old Englishman told a Spanish sports daily that it had been a dream come true to play alongside Zidane for three years at Real.         
	To train with Zidane for three years (2003-06) was a dream, confessed Beckham, who has been capped over 100 times by his country.         
	For me he is the greatest player of all time.         
	Beckham, who is now playing for Los Angeles Galaxy, also believed that the best Spanish player at the moment is Barcelonas playmaker Xavi, who inspired Spain to the Euro 2008 title last month and was judged player of the tournament.

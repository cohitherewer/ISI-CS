                                Sandeep Singh   scored a brace    
	Ipoh: India warded off a second-half resurgence by Belgium to script a 6-4 victory and keep themselves afloat in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup on Monday.         
	The Indians had a flattering 5-1 lead by half time but their opponents fought back to score three goals in the second session.         
	The young Indians managed to hold on to their lead to record their second successive win in the seven-nation meet.         
	Shivendra Singh and Sandeep Singh rammed in two goals apiece while S. V. Sunil and Diwakar Ram chipped in with a goal each.         
	Alexender de Sadeleere, Jerome Trueyns, Thomas Briels and Charles Vandewgheles were the scorers for Belgium.         
	India have now garnered six points from four matches . They lost their first two matches aga-inst New Zealand and Argentina.         
	The team started off with a flourish, scoring as many as five goals in the opening session, but seemed to lose their rhythm after the interval.         
	Belgium dominated the initial minutes before India scored their first goal through Shivendra Singh in the ninth minute.         
	India showed commendable perfection in converting the penalty corners. Four of the six goals were scored converting the short corners.         
	In the 22nd minute, young drag-flicker Diwakar Ram netted the second goal. But two minutes later De Sadeleere reduced the margin by scoring from a penalty corner.         
	Sandeep was introduced in place of Innocent Kullu after Belgium converted their first penalty corner and the experienced drag-flicker struck two valuable goals.         
	India extended the lead when Diwakars senior pro Sandeep beat the Belgian goalkeeper in 29th minute to make it 3-1.         
	In the 32nd minute, an unmarked Sunil dodged pass the opponent defenders and scored the fourth one for India from a well-organised move from the right flank.         
	Just before halftime, Sandeep banked on another penalty corner to help India go into the break with a big lead.         
	Belgium dominated proceedings in a large way in the second half and pumped in as many as three goals through True (45th), Briels (59th) and Vandewegheles (61st) to rattle the Indian camp.         
	However, Shivendra completed his brace in the 67th minute to brought cheers for his side.           (PTI)

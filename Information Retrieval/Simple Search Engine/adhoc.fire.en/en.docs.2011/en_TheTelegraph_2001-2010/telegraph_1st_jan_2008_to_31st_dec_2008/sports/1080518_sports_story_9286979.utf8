The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The IPL isnt over for the Knight Riders: SRK 
                                                                                                                                                                                             The IPL isnt over for the Knight Riders: SRK 
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -   Bollywood superstar on the way forward after the mauling in Mumbai         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan                                 
	Mumbai: The Kolkata Knight Riders rout at the Wankhede on Friday night notwithstanding, owner Shah Rukh Khan kept his appointment with The Telegraph. That, in fact, delayed his departure from the stadium. Shah Rukh, though, didnt mind.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Friday having been a bad day in office for his team         
	Im an actor first and my days shoot went off well... I had a good-shoot day... It wasnt a bad day in office for me personally...         
	The Knight Riders poor show         
	Yeah... The team got taken apart, but these things happen... Some teams do end up losing badly... Of course, its sad when that happens to your own team.         
	Whether theres more disappointment that the huge defeat occurred in Mumbai, his base         
	No... I dont have this regional issue with the team... I dont believe in that (regionalism). Whats more disappointing is that weve lost both matches to the Mumbai Indians... Its not a good thing and we shouldve been able to cover our weaknesses (after the first-leg loss, at the Eden, on April 29)... There are technical issues involved, but the bottomline is that its not nice to lose to any team.         
	His take on what went wrong         
	It was a good toss to win and even wed planned to put the opposition in... With the ball doing a lot, it had to be a low scoring match... However, theres little that you can do if the team totals no more than 67... No matter how potent your bowling, I dont think you can defend that small a total... Whats heartening is that the boys didnt give up.         
	The next match, against the Chennai Super Kings, being as early as Sunday         
	First, the players have to leave Fridays defeat behind in Mumbai... One way of dealing with such losses is to say oh shit and walk with heads down... The other way is to look ahead and get over it quickly... Theres concern in the team, yes... Having said that, weve won five and lost five... Its a 50-50 percentage and the IPL isnt over for the Knight Riders.         
	His stand at the post-match team meeting         
	Its not for me to tell the players (about cricket)... I just cheered them up and asked them to focus on Sundays match. I sat with them, reinforcing that Im with them in good times and bad.         
	The one-on-one with Shoaib Akhtar in the dressing room         
	I didnt have anything special to say, just asked him to cheer up and quickly get the defeat, embarrassing though it was, out of his system.         
	Realistically, how soon can teams and individuals recover from an awful day in office         
	Id be up for it the very next morning... Ive always maintained that triumph and disaster are imposters... You need to leave both behind very fast... If you do badly, take it like a man... Take it on your chin and fight back.         
	Whether a lot more friends from the industry turned up to cheer the Knight Riders         
	I really dont know who came and who didnt... I was in the stands for a brief while and then came and sat with the boys... Everything kept happening so quickly! (Wife) Gauri would know exactly who came.         
	Two oldies, Sanath Jayasuriya and Shaun Pollock, making the biggest impact for the Mumbai Indians in their last couple of matches         
	I think they needed time to settle down in the Twenty20 format, just like Sourav Ganguly required time... Theyve adapted themselves and its because they learn so quickly that theyre such great and classy players... They work out strategies which suit them.         
	Whether Jayasuriya and Pollock, in particular, have proved that class matters the most         
	Im 42 and Im the reigning superstar... Some people tell me Im too old to be romancing... It all boils down to how you handle stress-situations... How you adapt... Essentially, how you reinvent yourself... Obviously, the guys who didnt have much of a Twenty20 exposure have reinvented themselves and have done well in the IPL.         
	Finally, on many women (not to speak of girls) wanting to queue up for a hug from him  inspired by 85-year-old Rama Chatterjees experience at The Sonar on Wednesday         
	(Laughs) Its not possible to hug everybody, but I do try and meet as many fans as possible. Try and keep as many happy as is possible.

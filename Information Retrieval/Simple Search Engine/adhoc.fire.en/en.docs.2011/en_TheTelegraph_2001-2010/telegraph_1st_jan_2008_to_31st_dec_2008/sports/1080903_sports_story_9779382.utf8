The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Novak Djokovic feels old already at 21
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Novak Djokovic feels old already at 21
            MARK HODGKINSON IN NEW YORK                                Novak Djokovic    
	A week younger than Britains Andy Murray, and aged 21 years and three months, Novak Djokovic is starting to feel old. It has not escaped Djokovics notice that there is a new wave of teenagers on the Grand Slam scene in Croatias Marin Cilic, Argentinas Juan Martin Del Potro and Japans Kei Nishikori.         
	Another young racket-swinger is Latvias Ernests Gulbis, who turned 20 just last week. The generation behind Murray and Djokovic have started to arrive.         
	What I have been through in all these years, yes, I do feel a little old, like I played tennis all my life. But, no, its good for the sport to see new teenagers and rising stars, like Cilic, Del Potro and Nishikori. Theyre all top 10 players for the future. Im sure were going to see them in the future, Djokovic said.         
	He saw for himself what the new generation can do here at the US Open, as he needed four sets and almost four hours to beat Cilic in their third-round encounter under the lights of the Arthur Ashe Stadium  the Croatian was hitting the balls so hard that he was threatening to tear off the yellow felt. Cilic, a 19-year-old who stands at 6ft 6in, can really rip that serve. He can also move well for a big man.         
	The other young players have impressed at the final Grand Slam of the season. Gulbis, a quarter finalist at this years French Open, troubled Andy Roddick in their second-round match last week, and Del Potro and Nishikori were due to go on Louis Armstrong Stadium on Monday night to play for a place in the last eight         
	His baseline brand of tennis is at home on hardcourts, and his form in North America has been decent, as he made the semi-finals in Toronto and the Cincinnati final. On both occasions, he lost to Murray. So the balance of power between Djokovic and Murray has shifted.         
	And here comes the new generation. No longer is Djokovic the New Big Thing. The Daily Telegraph

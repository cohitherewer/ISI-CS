	After much careful consideration I have decided to step down as England Test captain effective immediately. I have made this decision with an enormous amount of pride and without any external pressure.         
	This decision has been something that has crossed my mind for some time. I had every ambition to lead the England team to the next Ashes Series but as England captain I feel Ive run out of steam.         
	I believe that the best thing for the team is to embark on a new direction under a new captain. I also believe the best thing for me is to try and get back to being best batsmen I can be. Ill still have all the experience and knowledge to pass on and I hope to be a valuable player for both my county and the England team.         
	Id like to take this opportunity to thank all the fans who have always been so supportive and have provided a huge inspiration to me as captain. A captain is only as good as his team and Ive been fortunate enough to captain some terrific players and great blokes.    
	Collingwood Statement         
	Ive made the decision to step down as Englands one-day captain as I want to give myself the best chance to perform for England and enjoy my cricket.         
	Whilst I am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain Englands one-day side, I feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for England across all forms of the game. I feel the England captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team.         
	Ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket, across all forms of the game, but Ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult. The last thing I want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the teams, which is why Ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration.         
	I will continue to make myself available to England for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in Englands future success.

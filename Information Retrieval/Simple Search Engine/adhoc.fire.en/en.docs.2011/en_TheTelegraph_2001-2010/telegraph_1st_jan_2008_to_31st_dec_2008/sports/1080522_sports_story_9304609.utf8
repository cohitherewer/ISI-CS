The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New era crown beckons Sharapova, Ivanovic
                                                                                                                                                                                                     New era crown beckons Sharapova, Ivanovic
                                Maria Sharapova    
	Paris: Seldom has the French Open got underway with so much uncertainty shrouding the womens game.Justine Henins shock retirement in last week saw the years second Grand Slam tourney loose its queen and hot favourite, the little Belgian having triumphed in Paris in four of the last five years including the last three straight.         
	Now, who would take over her tiara in Paris, is anything but clear with the top candidates, all struggling to a greater or lesser degree with a combination of injuries, loss of form and sheer fatigue.         
	In Henins absence, Maria Sharapova would inherit the top seed and just a few weeks ago, the tall Russian, who once said she was like a cow on ice when playing on clay, looked like she could mount a grave threat for the first time.         
	But her storming start in the season, including a first clay court crown at Amelia Island, was badly stalled in Rome last week when she had to pull out of her semi-final with Jelena Jankovic due to a strained calf muscle.         
	There are serious doubts, whether her fragile physical condition can withstand the two weeks of grind and grit at the Roland Garros.         
	Sharapova, who reached the semi-finals in Paris last year for the first time in five attempts, like Roger Federer says that Wimbledon would always remain her top priority, but like the Swiss, she is also desperate to win in Paris to complete a career Grand Slam.         
	I will be trying my utmost to win (French Open) this year or in the years to come as I need it to complete the set, she said.         
	There is a great tradition at the Roland Garros, the fans are so into it that sometimes they can be a bit hard to take, but its the only Grand Slam tournament with a Latin public who love to make themselves heard.         
	Im not a specialist on clay, but on the other hand you cant say its a surface that I am foreign to.         
	A lot of the youth tournaments when I was growing up in the United States were on clay and the same when I started on the secondary Indian Tennis Federation (ITF) circuits in Europe.         
	So even if I do have more problems on clay than on other surfaces, I still have some experience of playing on it, Maria said.         
	Serena Williams met a similar fate to Sharapova in Italy having to withdraw from her quarter final tie after hurting her back while training, just the latest in a long litany of injuries that regularly sidelined the former world No.1.         
	She insists that the injury should not prevent her from venturing a second French Open crown after that of 2002, but the 26-year-old, like older sister Venus, has never felt that comfortable in Paris where their power games are defused by the slow surface and their popularity has never been high.         
	All that could open the door for Italian Open champion , Jankovic and her younger compatriot, Ana Ivanovic who made the final only last year to embarrassingly collapse in a heap of nerves when faced with Henin.         
	Ivanovic would have the added incentive of knowing that a win in Paris could see her become world No.1 for the first time at the age of just 20, thus opening up a huge vista of riches and fame that could possibly rival that of 21-year-old Sharapova, whom she crushed in straight sets in last years semi-final.         
	A Grand Slam final between the two glamour girls of womens tennis, one blonde and one brunette, would be a huge draw for the tourney and would possibly set the stage for a lengthy rivalry that could underpin the sports popularity in the years to come that leaves the rest of the Russian brigade with any of 2006 runner-up Svetlana Kuznetsova, 2004 runner-up Elena Dementieva, Anna Chakvetadze or Vera Zvonareva capable of mounting a challenge.         
	. Amelie Mauresmo looks set to be in a downward spiral and would be lucky to make it past the first week, Marion Bartoli is not at her best on clay and last weeks suprise Italian Open finalist Alize Cornet is still too tender at just 18.

	New Delhi: Union sports minister M.S. Gill on Tuesday welcomed the Indian Olympic Associations (IOA) decision to disband the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), saying such a step was necessary.         
	The decision regarding the IHF, taken on Monday evening by the executive committee of the IOA, was necessary, the minister said in a statement.         
	It was a unanimous decision and in my judgement, appropriate in the given situation. I have carefully noted the composition of the new selection committee. I would hope that they work in unison and for the best interest of hockey and youth of India, he added, referring to the new selection committee comprising former Olympians.         
	In my judgement, it will also be necessary to have a compact, well chosen and efficient new administration for the IHF. I am confident the IOA will address this.         
	The minister had asked IHF chief K.P.S. Gill to step down after the bribe scandal involving secretary K Jyothikumaran.         
	Meanwhile, ousted IHF chiefs talents will be utilised when Delhi host the 2010 Commonwealth Games, IOA president Suresh Kalmadi said here on Tuesday.         
	K.P.S. Gill was a renowned police officer and has done a lot of work But we had to take the decision (to suspend IHF) in the greater interest of Indian hockey. But his talents will be utilised in Commonwealth Games, Kalmadi said.         
	Meanwhile, top players who were ignored during Gills tenure as IHF chief will be given a chance to prove their worth, according to new chairman of selection panel Aslam Sher Khan.

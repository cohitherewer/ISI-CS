	Calcutta: Leander Paes feels the chances of India winning a medal at the Beijing Olympics are very bright if Mahesh Bhupathi teams up with him.         
	The chances of our winning the medal are very bright. If you look at history, Mahesh and myself are the most experienced. We have won many Grand Slams together and were the No.1 pair in the world. No other team can be compared with us, the Davis Cup captain said at the Bengal Tennis Association (BTA) on Friday.         
	Paes said on Thursday in New Delhi that it was time for Bhupathi to cast aside differences and keep the interests of the country in mind.         
	The AITA will have a two-week conditioning camp from the last week of July in Mumbai and both players have been asked to attend.         
	Looking ahead, Paes is planning a legends meet in the city in November. Ive already spoken to a few of the greats... Pat Cash, Michael Stich, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, Martina Navratilova and Mats Wilander are among the ones Im trying for. The tournament of legends is likely to be held from November 25, Paes said on Friday.         
	He also confirmed plans to set up an academy in the city. Ive been thinking about it for the past one and a half years. I thought it was time to give something back to tennis. This is where it all started and my heart is So thats why Ive come together with the BTA to set up the Leander Paes Centre of Excellence.         
	I met state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty this afternoon and was very encouraged by his words. He has guaranteed me all help to build the academy. It will offer state-of-the-art training. It will be run under the guidance of the BTA, said Paes.         
	It is learnt that Chakraborty has promised him land in Rajarhat to set up the academy.         
	He also voiced his support for Sourav Gangulys leadership. Hes the best captain the country ever had. Im a firm believer in history. Hes a dear friend with whom I trained in 1991 Watching his comeback made me proud. Hes hard working and a true champion.

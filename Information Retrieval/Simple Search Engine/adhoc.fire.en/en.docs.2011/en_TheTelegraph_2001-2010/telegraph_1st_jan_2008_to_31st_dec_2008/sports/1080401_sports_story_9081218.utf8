	Miami: American Lindsay Davenport rolled back the years by crushing world No. 2 Ana Ivanovic 6-4, 6-2 in the Sony Ericsson Open third round on Sunday.         
	Top seed Justine Henin, Svetlana Kuznetsova and the Williams sisters all advanced safely to the fourth round but the experienced Davenport took centre stage with her victory over in-form Ivanovic.         
	The Serb, who arrived in Miami after winning the Pacific Life Open title, had no answers to the aggressive game brought to the court by world No. 33 Davenport.         
	Ivanovic is the second top-10 player Davenport has beaten since returning to the Tour last September after giving birth to her first child.         
	Davenport won 13 of 14 points at the net and cancelled out her 20 unforced errors with 20 winners.         
	The former world No. 1 led 6-4, 3-0 when it appeared that Ivanovic might fight back when she broke serve in the fourth game, but Davenport recovered the break immediately.         
	Davenport next faces No. 13 Dinara Safina, who rallied past No. 18 Sybille Bammer 4-6, 6-1, 6-0.         
	Russian third seed Kuznetsova, the 2006 champion, saved a match point before beating world No. 27 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus 1-6, 7-5, 6-0.         
	Henin dispatched Sara Errani of Italy 6-2, 6-1 in just 64 minutes, breaking the world No. 72 five times.         
	Serena Williams overcame 60 unforced errors to beat Flavia Penetta 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 after trailing the Italian 0-3 in the second set.         
	Sixth seed Venus Williams spent only 67 minutes on court, taking care of wild card Marina Erakovic of New Zealand 6-2, 6-1.         
	No. 4 Jelena Jankovic won her second match in 18 hours, beating Lucie Safarova 6-2, 6-1. Ai Sugiyama edged No. 7 Daniela Hantuchova 6-4, 6-7, 7-5.         
	Other seeded women eliminated were No. 11 Patty Schnyder, No. 22 Katarina Srebotnik and No. 24 Amelie Mauresmo.         
	On the mens side, No. 2 Rafael Nadal never faced a break point and beat Nicolas Kiefer 6-2, 6-4. Number nine James Blake outlasted 35-year-old Fabrice Santoro, 6-3, 6-7, 6-4, while No. 16 Paul-Henri Mathieu beat No. 20 Carlos Moya 7-6, 7-5. Dmitry Tursunov rallied past No. 32 Feliciano Lopez 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.

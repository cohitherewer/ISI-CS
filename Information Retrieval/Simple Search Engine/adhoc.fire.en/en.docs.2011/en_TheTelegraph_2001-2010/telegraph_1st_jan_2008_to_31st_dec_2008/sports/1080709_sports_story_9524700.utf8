  - IPL has contributed to Dhoni being fatigued, could get worse next year       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Team India Test captain Anil Kumble and selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar during the meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                 
	Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhonis decision to skip the three-Test series in Sri Lanka and Yuvraj Singhs exclusion are being talked about more, but no less significant has been the selectors move to give the vice-captaincy back to Virender Sehwag.         
	The same selection committee, headed by Dilip Vengsarkar, had removed Sehwag (a stand-in Test captain) from the No.2 position after the disastrous ODI series in South Africa some 18 months ago.         
	The beneficiary then had been V.V.S.Laxman, who was made Rahul Dravids deputy for the three-Test series there. Later, even Laxman was removed and the job went to Sachin Tendulkar. The musical chairs with the vice-captaincy continued with Dhoni (the ODI and Twenty20 captain) being appointed Anil Kumbles deputy.         
	That was last November.         
	The present selection committee (Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh, Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal are Vengsarkars colleagues) may not pick the next Test squad  for the home series against Australia  but an option for the Test captaincy it seems has been created.         
	So far, it was assumed that Dhoni would eventually get to lead in all forms.         
	Everything points to Kumble remaining the captain for as long as he plays... If Sehwag is consistent and the feedback is that hes ready for the top job, then he could be an option to succeed him... Right now, then, I wouldnt say his appointment today (Tuesday) should be seen as a stop-gap measure only, one of the selectors told The Telegraph from Mumbai.         
	At the very least, thats an interesting comment and a remarkable change in the Sehwag-script. At the start of the year, for example, he wasnt even in the Test XI.         
	For the record, Sehwag has averaged 73-plus since his Test comeback at the Waca in mid-January. The runs include a superb 151 at the Adelaide Oval and a career-best 319 at the Chepauk against South Africa, two months after that hundred.         
	Moreover, Sehwag has been consistent in ODIs too  an average in excess of 41 (which is great in limited overs cricket) since making a return in the home series against Pakistan last November.         
	Talking of Dhoni, while he has been honest about the fatigue-factor, theres no denying that the much-hailed Indian Premier League (IPL) has actually claimed him as its victim.         
	Dhonis no fool to miss out on the mega bucks, but its unfortunate that the IPL has contributed (not that it will be publicly acknowledged) to his being more than just tired mentally and physically.         
	With the 2008-09 calendar being as tight, and with nobody going to miss the IPL, theres every chance that more cricketers will opt out of national duty on account of fatigue.         
	The Board, which is promoting the IPL, needs to introspect. Its another matter whether that will actually be done.         
	Meanwhile, Yuvraj, Wasim Jaffer and Irfan Pathan have been dropped wholly because of form.         
	Nobody will dispute that Yuvraj was a failure in the two Tests that he played in Australia last season, but its also a fact that hes always on trial in the sports longest version.         
	So much so that last week, in Karachi, Yuvraj told this Reporter: Getting just one or two Tests at a time has made me insecure... Irrespective of the format, every player needs to feel secure... Otherwise, he wont be able to give off his best... Security in the mind is a critical element.         
	Over a period of almost eight years (ODI debut was in the October 2000 ICC Knockout meet in Nairobi) as an international cricketer, Yuvraj has only played 23 Tests.         
	The 24th wont come in a hurry.         
	Footnote: There could be awkward moments in the Team India dressing room if Yuvraj is retained as the No.2 in the five ODIs which follow the Tests. Sehwag, after all, will also be in that squad...

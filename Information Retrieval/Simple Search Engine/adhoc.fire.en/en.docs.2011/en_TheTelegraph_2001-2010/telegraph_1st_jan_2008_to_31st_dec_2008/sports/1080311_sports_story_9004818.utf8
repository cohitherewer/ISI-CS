            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Forty young coaches from the region will get an opportunity to enhance their skills under two former English Premier League stars with the launch of an innovative development programme  Premier Skills.         
	The coaches, in the under-35 age group, would be given training on technical and fitness aspects during the six-day programme.         
	At the launch on Monday afternoon, chief coach Warren Barton said: After the six-day programme, the trainee coaches will be given log books which they have to fill up daily. Based on their performance, there will be a four-day revisit programme in October or November when we propose to take the course to the next level.         
	The programme, run in conjunction with the British Council, also involves the All India Football Federation and ESPN-Star Sports.         
	The participants would be made well versed with the elements of football coaching such as nutrition and fitness and identifying ethical and cultural dimensions of issues faced by coaches. The trainees have been shortlisted from 300 applicants.         
	This is the second leg of the programme in the country. A total of 40 coaches from Northern India attended the camp in Delhi from February 4-9.         
	We are looking at providing career opportunities for the coaches who are part of the programme. We are talking with EPL on ensuring career prospects for the trainees, said Barton.         
	Former Jamaican international Robbie Earle would be the other leading coach.         
	The duo would be assisted by Gareth Prosser and Victor Bettinelli. Eighty Indian coaches will benefit from the programme over a period of three years.

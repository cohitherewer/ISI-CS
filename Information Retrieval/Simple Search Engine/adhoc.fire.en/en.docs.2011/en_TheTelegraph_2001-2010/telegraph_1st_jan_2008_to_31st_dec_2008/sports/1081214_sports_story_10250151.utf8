                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ebrahim to drive in F2
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Armaan Ebrahims F1 ambitions got a major boost on Saturday when he got his entry confirmed for 2009 F2 championship, a feeder series for the sports elite racing event.         
	The championship consists of 8 rounds with 16 races across Europe and will be held along with the World Touring Car Championship. The championship races are scheduled from May to November, 2009. The winner of the F2 Championship will get a Test drive with the Williams F1 team and the top 3 winners of the championship will be awarded a F1 license by the FIA.         
	The unique feature of the F2 Championship is that it is 1/4th the cost of the GP2 Series and half the cost of the World Series Renault Championship. All costs included, the championship budget comes to 250,000 GBP as compared to a GP2 budget which is in the range of 1.3 million euros.         
	Armaan who is currently undergoing a physical and mental training camp in Singapore, said: The F2 Championship is a very beneficial concept for most drivers including myself. A few months back, we wanted to try the GP2 Series or the World Series by Renault for 2009.         
	But we knew that we had only a five per cent chance to find the budgets for those championships.         
	All the 24 cars will be built by the Williams F1 Team at their factory.         
	Each driver is allowed to have his own personal engineer working with him, but he will not be able to touch the car. Work on the car can be done only by the F2 appointed staff.

	Calcutta: Viktor Laznicka of the Czech Republic and Nguyen Anh Dung of The Philippines were jointly in lead with 4 points each after the fourth round of the Calcutta Open Grandmasters Chess Tournament on Thursday.         
	Three players  Sandipan Chanda, Ziaur Rahman and Smbat Lputian  follow on 3.5 points apiece.         
	On the top board, queens were exchanged early in a Slav defence in the match between S. Arun Prasad and Viktor Laznicka. Laznicka had a passed pawn on e2 in a rook and bishop versus rook and bishop ending which tied down Prasads pieces. He resigned when one more passed pawn on the b-file became unstoppable.         
	Dung halted P. Konguvels brilliant run when he dispatched the latter in 44 moves in a Grunfeld defence. Konguvel was forced to give up a bishop to stop the menacing pawn of Nguyen. The rest was a matter of technique for the Filipino Grandmaster. Konguvel had beaten GM David Alberto and Dibyendu Barua in the 2nd and 3rd rounds, respectvely.         
	GM R.B. Ramesh won a pawn in a rook ending against Koneru Humpy and tried desperately to win a theoretical drawn endgame in what was the longest game of the tournament. Both finally agreed to split the point on the 105th move.         
	City-based Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda made short work of GM R.B. Ramesh in a Sicilian defence. Sandipan had two dangerous pawns in the centre which he utilised effectively in the middle game. Sandipan took control of the open d-file and threatened to queen his pawn on the 7th rank after which Ramesh resigned.         
	Neelotpal Das was held to a draw by N. Sudhakar Babu. Arghyadip Das stayed on course in quest of his 2nd GM norm as he beat lesser-ranked Vinay Kumar Matta in a Sicilian defence.         
	GM Barua faced little resistance from Diwakar Prasad Singh in a Giuco Piano opening. Singh was at the centre of a controversy last year for allegedly taking the help of electronic devices. He was later cleared by the All India Chess Federation after an inquiry commission. Singh who had an Elo rating of nearly 2550 last year has lost a phenomenal 200 points and is now rated at 2336.         
	The organisers, to avoid any such controversy this year, had decided to install mobile jammers but the possibility of installing them looks remote as they had not applied to the Department of Telecommunications, which is mandatory.

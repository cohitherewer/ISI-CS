	Moscow: Vera Zvonareva beat Vania King 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the first reverse singles on Sunday to give Russia an insurmountable 3-0 lead over the United States in their Fed Cup semi-final and send the holders into the final.         
	Russia will appear in their fourth final in the last five years in September when they take on Spain, who beat China in Beijing.         
	In Beijing, Spain booked their place in the final after Nuria Llagostera Vives beat Chinas Peng Shuai 6-4, 6-4, giving the five-time champions an unassailable 3-0 lead.

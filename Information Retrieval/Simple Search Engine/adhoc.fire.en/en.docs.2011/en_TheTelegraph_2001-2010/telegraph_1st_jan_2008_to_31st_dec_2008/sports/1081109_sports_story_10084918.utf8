                                                                                                                                                                                                     Karim promises fight
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa will be a cautious man when his team, sans Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto, face Churchill Brothers in their seventh round match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	With seven points from as many matches, Bagan, according to the Moroccan, will be concentrating on their own strategy rather than the opponents line-up.         
	Odafe Okolie and Felix Chimaokwu are no doubt the best strikers in the country now. But we will stick to our plan, Bencharifa, one-time Churchill Brothers coach, said. Asked whether his experience with the Goan club will be an advantage, Karim said: I dont think so. Theyre a good team and are in good touch at the moment It will be a real test but we will not give up easily.

                                            CSA finds Gibbs guilty  Durban: After being arrested and charged for drunken driving, South African batsman Herschelle Gibbs was Wednesday found guilty of misconduct by Cricket South Africa.
  Cricket SA said in a statement that Gibbs had been found guilty of breaching the cricket body rsquo;s rules and code of conduct, which stated that ldquo;participants shall not use crude or abusive language nor make offensive gestures to any other participant, official or spectator rdquo;. ldquo;Gibbs was severely reprimanded for his action and reaction following his appearance in Johannesburg today (Wednesday) before Cricket South Africa rsquo;s disciplinary commissioner, advocate Michael Kuper, SC, rdquo; the CSA statement said.  Strauss relieved  London: England batsman Andrew Strauss is looking forward to playing international cricket in a more relaxed frame of mind after securing his place in the side with a Test-best 177 in the final match of the tour of New Zealand. Strauss rsquo;s hundred in Napier last month helped provide the platform from which England were able to go on and clinch a 121-run victory and, with it, a 2-1 series win.  ldquo;The hundred gave me a fair amount of relief but more than anything a great deal of happiness to get a hundred and help England win the series, rdquo; he said.  MCC doctrine  Mumbai: In a bid to ensure that the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) is played in ldquo;true spirit rdquo;, the BCCI Wednesday announced a tie-up with the Maryleborne Cricket Club (MCC) whose doctrine will be adopted by all the eight franchisees. The ldquo;spirit of the game rdquo; doctrine prepared by the MCC will be adopted by all the team captains and the players at the inauguration function of the IPL rsquo;s first season in Bangalore on April 18, IPL rsquo;s commissioner Lalit Modi said.  ldquo;The game must be hard as well as fair...The players of IPL will be role models for youngsters. It is therefore important that the players must play in true spirit, rdquo; MCC rsquo;s secretary and CEO Keith Bradshaw said.   Razzaq support  Karachi: Discarded allrounder Abdul Razzaq Wednesday accused the PCB of targeting senior players, the latest being Shoaib Akhtar, and trying to end their international careers. ldquo;After me, now the board has targeted Shoaib Akhtar. Their next targets are Mohammed Yousuf and Shahid Afridi, rdquo; Razzaq claimed. ldquo;I had started realising after the 2007 World Cup that the senior players were in for a hard time. Soon these fears started coming true and we were all gradually shunted out, rdquo; Razzaq said.  Heroes 147/6  Calcutta: Hyderabad Heroes made 147 for six after electing to bat against Chennai Superstars in the first semi-final of the Edelweiss 20s Challenge. At the Lal Bahadur Stadium in Hyderabad, Nicky Boje (47) was the top-scorer for Heroes. Kolkata Tigers will take on Lahore Badshahs in the second semi-final.  BRIEF SCORES

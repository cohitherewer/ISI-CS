India need a good coach to start with, says Isinbayeva | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         India need a good coach to start with, says Isinbayeva
                  Yelena Isinbayeva                     
	Beijing: In the foreseeable future, Yelena Isinbayeva will keep raising the bar till she hits that vertical limit. Post-retirement, the iconic Russian pole vaulter says she wants to help the sport expand its horizon to newer pastures.         
	The greatest female pole vaulter in the games history said she would return to 2012 London Games to defend the gold medal she won here.         
	But once she calls it quits, Isinbayeva said she would love to tour India if that helps spread the game.         
	Once Im through with it all, it would be my obligation to spread the game, she said.         
	If travelling to India and interacting with the youngsters helps the cause, I would love to do that, said the Russian, who won the gold medal here bettering her previous world record with an intimidating 5.05m.         
	Isinbayeva reckons the Russian and Ukrainian dominance stems from their excellent infrastructure, good coaches and a crop of talented athletes.         
	We have a lot of good athletes back home, besides technically sound coaches. In fact, some of the other countries also have Russian coaches, said the 26-year-old athlete.         
	And she prescribes the same formula for India.         
	Its a slightly complicated sport, for which you need really good facilities. Poles are quite costly and then you need proper pit and machines as well. Having good coaches around is also very crucial.         
	India need one good coach to start it off and others would pick it from there. It has to start somewhere, said the pole-vaulter who has created 24 world records so far.         
	Asked if she felt lonely at the top with no real competition from anyone, she said she wanted it that way.         
	No complaint at all, said the Russian.         
	Asked what has been the best moment of her career so far, Isinbayeva said, Not one, but so many like my first world record, my first Olympic gold in Athens, crossing the 5m mark, and now winning the gold here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Leander criticises Prakash attitude
                                                Leander criticises Prakash attitude
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Team India in the Davis Cup doesnt seem to be a happy family.         
	On Friday, skipper Leander Paes dropped a bombshell when he accused teammate Prakash Amritraj for showing a lack of professionalism on the eve of the tie against Uzbekistan.         
	An unfit Prakash  he was suffering from an upset stomach earlier this week  was dropped from the opening day singles. Prakash, however, said he was fully fit for the tie.         
	On Friday, Paes justified Prakashs omission by saying: The team doctor saw him and Prakash was on medication.         
	People can claim whatever they want. He was not fit and it was for everyone to see. He was throwing up all over the place. He went out on Saturday night and had this Delhi Belly and was ill the next. It was unprofessional on his part to have gone out, the Indian captain said.         
	I wanted him to get adequate rest for the doubles match and be fitter on Sunday, Paes said. As a captain I need to make the calls. If the captains strategy clicks, then everyone says he was a great captain. Otherwise the captain is blamed. I hope Prakash gets fully fit for the doubles.         
	Prakash said he was fit and that he had informed the captain about it. It is the captains call. I dont want to say anything more and jeopardise the tie. I am a team man after all, he said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Holidaying fans make Vienna a party zone

	Vienna/Berlin: Hundreds of chanting and partying Spanish and German supporters gathered in Vienna, transforming the historic city centre in to a big party zone ahead of the European Championship final.         
	Police expect around 40,000 German fans and 15,000 Spanish supporters to descend on the Austrian capitals centre as Germany take on Spain.         
	Its one big street party right now  happy and loud but very peaceful, said Christian Stella from Vienna police. Transforming the citys main square around St Stephens cathedral into a sea of red and yellow, Spanish fans had kicked off their party since the early morning hours, accompanied by their own marching band.         
	The Spanish people are simply more fun, they know much better than the Germans how to party, said Maria de la Cruz Aparicio from Ciudad Real, who had no ticket for the match in the Austrian capital, but had flown with her family to Vienna to watch the match on one of the big screens in the fan zone.         
	Spain is the winner, of course, tonight and it will be absolutely fantastic, she said, standing beside a group of male Spanish fans clad in flamenco dresses and jumping up and down.         
	German supporters, mingling with their Spanish counterparts between dozens of street vendors flogging tops and scarves, begged to differ.         
	We might need a little longer to get started but you will see soon enough that this will be a great day for the Germans and a sad one for the Spanish, said Roland Braeuer from southern Germany, dressed in a Germany top.         
	Though Vienna has the tournaments biggest fan zone stretching along a tree-lined grand boulevard curving around its city centre, the square around St Stephens cathedral emerged as a main gathering point for fans in the run up to the matches. We actually wanted to do a bit of sightseeing and go down to the Danube before watching the match in the fan zone tonight, said Sylvia, who had flown in from Berlin.         
	But the atmosphere is so fantastic, I cant tear myself away from it  I have to stay here, said the 56-year-old, proudly displaying a Lukas Podolski top.         
	Meanwhile, in Berlin, fans of Germany unfurled the national flag, daubed the national colours of black, red and gold upon their faces, and readied the beer and bratwursts ahead of the Euro 2008 final.         
	Though confidence in the team was high ahead of the match, there was concern about the fitness of Michael Ballack.         
	With or without Ballack, Germanys fans will still gather in homes, public viewing areas and in restaurants and bars to watch the game. Across the country, German flags fluttered from balconies and car radio antennae. In the capital, the fabled fan mile counted thousands upon thousands of people to watch the game on large outdoor screens.         
	Spain supporters were also to be found, with many arriving at Berlins main train station to make their way to the fan mile near the iconic Brandenburg Gate. In Munich, a trainload of Germany and Spain fans left for Vienna to be part of the celebration in the Austrian capital.         
	Some businesses are planning to shut down during the game, including automakers Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG, so their workers wont miss out.         
	German political leaders predicted victory for the team, with Economy Minister Michael Glos forecasting a 4-3 win while Labour Minister Olaf Scholz said the result would be a 2-1 win over the Spanish. Guido Westerwelle, the leader of the opposition Free Democrats, was certain of a German win.         
	We will win the final, he wrote in Sundays edition of Bild. German President Horst Koehler also exuded confidence and exhorted his countrymen and women to cheer long and loud. I am sure that our team is going to succeed, he said. Our opponent is strong, but with the fire in the German teams heart, we can beat them.

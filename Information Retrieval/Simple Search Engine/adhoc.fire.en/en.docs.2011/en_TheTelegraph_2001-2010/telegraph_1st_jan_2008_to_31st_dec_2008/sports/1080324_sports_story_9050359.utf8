                                                   Warnapura lifts Lanka
                      
	Georgetown: Opener Malinda Warnapura scored his maiden Test century to lead Sri Lanka to 269 for four on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies in Georgetown, Guyana, on Saturday.         
	The 28-year-old, playing his third Test, compiled a patient 120 from 226 balls with 14 fours.         
	Fellow opener Michael Vandort provided early support with 52 as Sri Lanka started the two-match series with a 130-run opening stand.         
	Kumar Sangakkara chipped in with 50 to leave the visitors in a strong position. Captain Mahela Jayawardene was 25 not out at the close and Tillekeratne Dilshan unbeaten on 15.         
	Fast bowler Jerome Taylor was the most successful bowler, taking three for 59.         
	The opening batsmen justified Jayawardenes decision to bat first on a grassless pitch that offered little movement to the three West Indies seamers.         
	Warnapura and Vandort batted through the morning session, putting on 85 by lunch after the home team missed a chance to run out Vandort.         
	Vandort was finally dismissed after being trapped lbw by an inswinging yorker from Taylor. Warnapura had an escape on 95 when he was dropped at slip off spinner Chris Gayle.         
	The left-hander went to his hundred before falling when he gloved a short delivery from Dwayne Bravo down the leg side to keeper Dinesh Ramdin.         
	The West Indies dragged themselves back into the game when Taylor grabbed two quick wickets in the final session.         
	Sangakkara edged a full-length delivery to first slip .           (REUTERS)

	Calcutta: I-League runners-up Churchill Brothers punished Mohun Bagan in the IFA Shield opener at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Robert Lalthlamuana scored the all-important goal in the 31st minute. Mohun Bagans woes would have multiplied had not their goalkeeper, Sangram Mukherjee, produced a spectacular display, which included a penalty save.         
	The Mohun Bagan players looked tired after their I-League adventure and it was one of those days when their famed attacking duo, Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto, had their focus elsewhere.         
	Churchill, on the other hand, held the upperhand thanks to Mbayo Iyomi, Kalu N. Ogba and D. Raju. The trio held the rival defence under siege, with the slow moving Douglas da Silva, playing as a hole in the home backline, being exposed time and again to the Churchill players fast runs and quick exchanges.         
	However, it was Peter Odafe who was primarily responsible for conceding the goal. The Nigerian unnecessarily dilly-dallied with the ball after it was cleared by a diving Sangram off the feet of Kalu, allowing Mbayo to snatch it from him and back-pass to Robert. The Churchill midfielders prompt right-footer from about 25 yards went in with the goalkeeper still to gain his ground.         
	It could have been 0-2 for Mohun Bagan five minutes before the breather after Sangram tripped Kalu. But the goalkeeper brilliantly saved Chandam Singhs penalty.         
	In between, Barreto came close to scoring but Sangrams opposite, Vinay Singh, denied the Brazilian. The rest was the story of Churchills domination and Sangrams battle to save his team more blushes.

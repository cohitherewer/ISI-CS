	Anecdotes         
	Wooden leg         
	American gymnast George Eyser, who won three gold medals (parallel bars, horse vault, rope climbing), two silvers (pommel horse, combined) and a bronze (high bar), astonished the world with his success  considering that he was competing with a wooden leg, his left leg having been amputated after he was run over by a train.               
	Phantom representative         
	Albert Coray, silver medallist in the marathon, won a medal for France even though the country was not officially present. He was actually chosen to compete by the Chicago Athletic Association, with whom he won a second silver in the 4x1 mile relay event.               
	Feet in the water         
	The swimming contests were held in an artifical lake built for the International Exhibition. Races were started from a raft, with competitors sitting with their feet in the water. On a regular basis the presence of eight people on the landing stage resulted in leaking.               
	Public scattered         
	Whilst hundreds of thousands of visitors were attracted by agricultural machines or the museums concentrating on the war of Secession, scarcely two thousand spectators turned up to watch the athletics, normally the number one attraction at the Games.         
	Hahn: the Milwaukee meteor         
	The big star of the St Louis Games was home-boy Archie Hahn, who won three gold medals from his exploits in the 60m, 100m and 200m.         
	In the last named race, the Michigan University student, nicknamed the Milwaukee meteor, set a time of 21.6 sec, a new Olympic record which remained unbeaten for 28 years.         
	Born on September 14, 1880, Archibauld Archie Hahn discovered athletics at the age of 19. He was signed up by the University organisers, who spotted athletic ability in this small and thin athlete with powerful legs.         
	Hahn had already won the 60m and 200m when he lined up for the final of the 100m. In spite of a strong wind, the American broke smartly to shoot into the lead and won easily in a time of 11.0 sec, ahead of his compatriot and Louisville rival, Nathaniel Cartmell (11.2 sec).         
	The American sprinter, a forerunner of the great stars America would later produce in this discipline, also took the 100m in the intercalated Games in 1906.               
	SUMMARY         
	The Games falter once more         
	Ironically, the organisation of another International Exhibition contributed to the moving of the 1904 Games venue from Chicago to Saint-Louis, Missouri, from July 1 to November 23.         
	The decision was taken personally by Theodore Roosevelt to mark the centenary of Louisanas links with the United States.         
	But the mix of people produced a second organisational disaster after Paris. The Olympic image emerged tarnished.         
	Sparse participation         
	Saint-Louis brought together around 600 athletes, 580 of them Americans, from only a dozen countries. The long Atlantic crossing discouraged many teams from making the effort to turn up.         
	But those who did, benefitted from their fellow citizens, already on American soil, to win several medals.         
	Saint-Louis produced a local hero  Archie Hahn, who won three titles (60m, 100m and 200m) in athletics.         
	But scandal erupted: the winner of the marathon, American Fred Lorz, was disqualified for accepting a lift in a car during the race. Initially, he was hailed as a true hero at the finish. But Alice Roosevelt, the Presidents daughter, had taken a photograph of his audacious move and he was eventually disqualified. Victory was handed to his compatriot, Thomas Hicks, who was also helped on his way by two shots of strychnine and several glasses of cognac. At that time, anti-doping controls were non-existent.         
	For the very first time, winners received gold medals, with the Americans receiving the majority, winning 79 gold and 244 medals in total.         
	But, as in Paris, the Olympic Games did not really come to life. Too many categories, too spread out, too many attractions beside sport. Barely two thousand spectators followed the athletics events.

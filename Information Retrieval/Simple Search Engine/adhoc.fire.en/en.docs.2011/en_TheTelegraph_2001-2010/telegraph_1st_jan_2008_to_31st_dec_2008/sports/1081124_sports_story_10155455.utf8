  - Sehwag, Zaheer put it beyond england in rain-hit fourth one-dayer
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: India clinched the seven-match ODI series against England, beating the visitors comprehensively in the rain-truncated fourth one-dayer here late on Sunday.         
	The hosts, who were already up 3-0 in the series, won by 19 runs after setting England a steep victory target of 198 runs from 22 overs via the Duckworth-Lewis method.         
	Put into bat in what was their 700th ODI, the hosts scored 166 for four from their 22 overs.         
	The India pace battery  Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma and Munaf Patel  picked up wickets at regular interval to keep a check on England, who were in with a chance till the end courtesy a brilliant 72 from Owais Shah. Andrew Flintoff also played a useful knock of 41 but it was not enough.         
	Shah hit three sixes and nine boundaries in his 48-ball knock.         
	Zaheer was at his miserly best, giving away only 20 runs off his five overs. He took the wickets of Shah and Samit Patel.         
	Towards the end of the England innings, it appeared that Zaheer had become the de facto captain during Ishants overs. It seemed as if captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was happy to let Zaheer set the fields.         
	Heavy showers interrupted play twice leading to the loss of more than five hours playing time, but the ground staff worked hard to salvage a game.         
	Earlier, opener Virender Sehwag scored a scintillating 69 off only 57 deliveries and Gautam Gambhir, who walked in at No. 3 in this match, contributed with a useful 40.         
	Sehwag and Gambhir stitched together a 79-run second-wicket partnership. Sehwag took control after Tendulkars return, playing some breathtaking drives and pulls as he lashed nine fours and three sixes in his 57-ball knock.         
	Sehwag and Gambhir both fell to off-spinner Graeme Swann caught by James Anderson in the deep looking for quick runs. It was almost raining sixes for India during the last five overs they faced.         
	In-form Yuvraj Singh, who hit centuries in the first two games of the series, scored a quick-fire 25 not out off 11 balls. He blasted three huge sixes as India put on 60 in the last five overs following the second stoppage.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who walked in amid lot of cheer at the fall of Gambhirs wicket, scored nine off five balls. He hit the first ball he faced, from off-spinner Swann, to the upper tier of the Chinnaswamy Stadium.         
	Dhoni was bowled by Samit Patel off the penultimate delivery of the Indian innings. Yusuf Pathan hit a huge six off the only ball, the last delivery of the innings, he faced to propel India to 166 for four.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, who made a return to the ODI format after a long gap of eight months, could manage only 11. He hit two boundaries before being cleaned up by Stuart Broad.

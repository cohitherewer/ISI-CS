The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DareDevils win in a canter
                                                                                                                                                                                             DareDevils win in a canter
            JAYDEEP BASU            DareDevils captain Sehwag after being dismissed for 12                           
	New Delhi: An impressive opening ceremony that saw Akshay Kumar dishing out an extraordinary display of stunts was the only enjoyable moment for the near capacity crowd at the Kotla on Saturday night.         
	Spectators, who lustily cheered the Bollywood star as he came sliding down a cable stretched across the ground at a height of around 100ft, remained mostly silent all through the encounter that never rose above mediocrity.         
	Rajasthan Royals, who batted first after skipper Shane Warne won the toss, made a mess of things in the middle and could muster only 129 for eight in the allotted 20 overs.         
	The situation could have been worse but for two youngsters  Ravindra Jadeja (29) and Dinesh Salunke (26)  who scored some useful runs during the later stages of the innings.         
	In reply, Delhi DareDevils made a mockery of the opposition who were a depleted combination. The home team, riding the strokeplay of Gautam Gambhir and Shikhar Dhawan, reached the target in 15.1 overs and won by nine wickets.         
	Their batting was the saving grace in terms of cricket on a day which was not the best advertisement for this version of the game.         
	While in-form Gambhir scored 58 in 46 deliveries with the help of seven fours and a six, Dhawan sent the ball eight times to the fence in his 41-ball knock. They were involved in an unbeaten second-wicket partnership of 112 runs after captain Virender Sehwag was out for 12.         
	Compared to what happened in Bangalore on Friday, the Kotla match was sheer disappointment. While the quality of cricket was poor for most part of the Rajasthan innings, lack of fireworks almost reduced the show into a non-event.         
	The Jaipur side, which played like an ordinary Ranji Trophy Plate side, was undone by Glenn McGrath. The Aussie great, who came out of retirement to play in the shorter version of the game, bowled with great accuracy and penetration to keep the scoreboard in check from the very beginning.         
	While McGrath led from the front with three fine overs at the start, none of the Rajasthan Royals foreign recruits could live up to their reputation. After two openers  Taruvar Kohli and Yousuf Pathan  were dismissed cheaply, Australian Shane Watson was expected to lend some respectability to the innings. Instead, he got himself run out in a poor fashion for 21.         
	Off a Rajat Bhatia slower delivery, Watson slogged the ball over cover and it dropped into the no mans land. Watson, who tried to take a quick single, was beaten by a good throw from Shikhar Dhawan.         
	Mahroof and Rajat Bhatia were the pick of the bowlers for Delhi DareDevils. Both captured two wickets each. New Zealander Daniel Vettori got the crucial wicket of Ravidra Jadeja, who hit two four and two sixes in his 23 balls innings.

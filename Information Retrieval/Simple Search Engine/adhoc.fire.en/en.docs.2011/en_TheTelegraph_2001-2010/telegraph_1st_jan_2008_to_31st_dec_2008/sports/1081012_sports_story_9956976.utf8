The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sorting out technique helped: Johnson
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sorting out technique helped: Johnson
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: Mitchell Johnson said on Saturday that a small technical adjustment in his feet position has helped him regain the accuracy in his bowling.         
	I have been working on a few little things around my feet position at the crease Last summer I was opening up my front leg and my front arm was going out. So I have tried to work really hard at getting my front arm and front leg going towards the off stump. Thats probably helped me a little bit, said the left-arm fast bowler, who has so far taken four wickets in this Test.         
	Staying relaxed has also helped him achieve success.         
	I have not been trying to put too much pressure on myself to bowl the perfect ball every time.         
	The Aussies are already focused on winning this Test. We will try to win this Test. Thats what Ricky wants us to do, he said.         
	Johnson was pretty excited to have picked up the four big names in the Indian batting order, but it was Sachin Tendulkars scalp that gave him most satisfaction.         
	To get those big names, its pretty exciting to me Sachin was going pretty hard at the ball. The one before he hit me through third man pretty hard, so I thought about a slower ball. It did the trick.         
	Johnson felt the bowlers were too aggressive against Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan, and had to pay the price.         
	 When the tail-enders come in you probably just push a little bit too hard. To bowl to the tail-enders, you have got to be patient and bowl like you would at the top order.         
	The fast bowler was enjoying the challenge of bowling in Indian conditions.         
	Its tough work and the wickets are different to what we have back home There are a few little cracks out there that were trying to aim for. I wouldnt say its a total graveyard.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand stays in sole lead
                                                   Anand stays in sole lead
                      
	Morelia: Viswanathan Anand drew with Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine to remain in sole lead after the end of the first leg of the Morelia-Linares chess tournament.         
	The Indian played safe with white after Ivanchuk carried out a fine counterplay in the middle game.         
	Anands status as sole leader was not hampered despite the other three games ending decisively.         
	Magnus Carlsen of Norway outdid nearest rival Levon Aronian of Armenia while former world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria beat Peter Leko of Hungary. Latvian-born Spaniard Alexei Shirov got the better of Tei-mour Radjabov of Azerbaijan.         
	Anand will thus go into the Linares leg (beginning on Thursday) of this category 21 event with 4.5 points to his credit followed by Topalov and Shirov (4).         
	Another half point behind were Carlsen and Aronian with 3.5 while Radjabov and Ivanchuk are joint fifth with three points apiece. Leko is at the bottom with 2.5 points in his kitty.         
	Anand faced the Sicilian Defence from Ivanchuk who opted for a Scheveningen set up. Anand decided against trying hard once his pawn structure on the queen-side was fractured and the game was drawn after the players reached a rook and minor pieces endgame. The game lasted 31 moves.

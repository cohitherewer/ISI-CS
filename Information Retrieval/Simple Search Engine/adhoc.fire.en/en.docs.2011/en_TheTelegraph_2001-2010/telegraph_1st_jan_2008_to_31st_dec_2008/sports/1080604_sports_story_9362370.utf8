	St Johns: Brett Lee claimed two wickets before lunch as West Indies struggled to 95 for three with Australia sensing victory in the second Test at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting opted to declare his teams second innings at the overnight total of 244 for six to give West Indies a target of 372 and his bowlers the full three seasons to try and bowl the hosts out.         
	Lee, who took five wickets for five runs in a superb spell of swing bowling on Monday, got the early breakthrough with just four runs on the board as Devon Smith chopped a rising delivery to Mike Hussey at gully for a duck.         
	Fellow opener Xavier Marshall was ruled caught behind off Stuart Clark shortly after as the hosts fell to 19 for two.         
	Skipper Ramnaresh Sarwan and Runako Morton steadied things before Lee returned for a second spell and trapped Morton lbw right in front. Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who scored an unbeaten 107 in the first innings, joined Sarwan before lunch and the pair, the most experienced and prolific of the West Indies batsmen, will need to produce a long partnership if defeat is to be avoided.         
	Earlier on Day IV, Australia extended their lead to 371, after Brett Lee bowled with vigour to hand them a healthy first innings lead.         
	The Australians, chasing quick runs to set up a match-winning position for them on the last day, reached 244 for six in their second innings when stumps were drawn.         
	This followed a dramatic morning period, when Lee captured five wickets for 59 runs from 21 overs, as West Indies, replying to Australias first innings total of 479 for seven declared, were dismissed for 352 about 10 minutes before the scheduled lunch interval.         
	It was the ninth time in a Test that Lee had taken five wickets or more in an innings, and sent West Indies crashing from the comfort of 314 for four to transform the complexion of the match.         
	Lee triggered the collapse, which saw West Indies lose their last six wickets for 38 runs in the space of 68 balls.         
	His bowling completely overshadowed another epic Test hundred from long-standing West Indies left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul, whose undefeated 107 was his 19th Test hundred, second in successive matches, and the home teams top score.         
	Chanderpaul reached his milestone, when he swept Andrew Symonds for the 11th of his 12 boundaries from 236 balls in almost six hours of batting.         
	Australia then made a sound start to their second innings, when openers Mike Hussey and Phil Jaques put on 74 for the first wicket.         
	But the Aussies lost makeshift opener Hussey before tea, when he was caught behind for 40 driving loosely at a delivery from Dwayne Bravo, as the visitors reached 92 for one at the break.         
	Hussey was promoted to open the batting, after Simon Katich was forced to seek medical treatment for a bruised rib, which he sustained when he scored 113 in the australia first innings.         
	After tea, the Australians hunted quick runs, and this provided West Indies with the chance to take a few wickets along the way.         
	Jaques made a purposeful 76 and solid batting down the order ensured that Australias lead gradually increased.         
	Jaques added 89 for the second wicket with Australian captain Ricky Ponting before they were both dismissed within 13 balls of each other to leave the visitors 178 for three.         
	The final Test starts on June 12 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.           (AGENCIES)

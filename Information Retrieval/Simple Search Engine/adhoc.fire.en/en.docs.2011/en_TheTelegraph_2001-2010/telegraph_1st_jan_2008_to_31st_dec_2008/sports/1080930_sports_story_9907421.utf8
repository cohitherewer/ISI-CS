The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I just want to play well, says Sachin
                                                                                                                                                                                                     I just want to play well, says Sachin
                      
	Bangalore: Sachin Tendulkar on Monday said there was no question of relaxing after breaking Brian Laras world record of 11,953 Test runs.         
	I have to concentrate on playing well. Record etc... is okay. If you play well, and if it (record) happens, its good, the batsman, who is just 76 runs short of that milestone, told reporters.         
	He added that the team had set certain targets for the four-Test series against Ricky Pontings side, and everyone is focussing on achieving those targets.         
	Tendulkar also said that Pontings young guns cannot be taken lightly.         
	They still have a lot of players who have played a lot of first-class cricket, Tendulkar said, asked if Australia were short on experience.         
	They (new entrants) have not played international cricket but that does not mean they cannot deliver. They have played a lot of cricket, and we would like to respect that. We dont want to be caught off-guard, the former captain said.         
	With the first Test beginning here on October 9, he said the team management would have plenty of planning to do in the next three-four days.         
	Tendulkar declined to comment on the omission of Sourav Ganguly from the Rest of India squad for the recently concluded Irani Trophy, and his absence from the camp.         
	I am not in a position to comment on that. I would leave that to the captain, coach and selectors who have taken certain decisions. They have certain ideas in their mind and we need to just abide by that, he said.         
	We just like to focus on our performance. Its India vs Australia. Its not certain individuals (in the Indian team) against certain individuals in their (Australian) side. Two countries are competing against each other.         
	The batting maestro brushed aside security concerns ahead of the four-Test series against Australia, saying the Indian players were not bothered but confident that they would never be targeted at home.         
	I dont think it (security concerns) bothers us. This (India) is our homeland. In our homeland, I dont think anyone can harm us, Tendulkar told the media.           (PTI)

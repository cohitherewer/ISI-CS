The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Desperate for victory, says Moores
                                                                                                                                                                                           Desperate for victory, says Moores
                      
	Bangalore: The Duckworth-Lewis defeat in the Kanpur ODI against India has left England a frustrated and disappointed side, admitted coach Peter Moores but insisted the visitors were capable of turning things around in the do-or-die fourth one-dayer here Sunday.         
	If you lose this game, you lose the series. Its a big game, Moores, whose wards are trailing 0-3 in the seven-match series, told reporters ahead of the day-night encounter at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.         
	We have got to do it here in Bangalore. From now on, every game is final game. We need that win (tomorrow) to get belief in ourselves. We are getting close (Indias victory margin is getting reduced), he added.         
	He said the tourists were disappointed with the way things panned out in Kanpur and said his side should have scored 270 in the third one-dayer but lost key wickets at crucial junctures.         
	On the possibility of bad light forcing an anti-climax in the coming Guwahati one-dayer as well, he said the team has spoken to Match Referee Roshan Mahanama, who has promised measures, including cutting short lunch time, to ensure that a similar situation did not arise.         
	England were on a high after a thumping series victory against South Africa before going to the West Indies for the Stanford Series.         
	Since then, their performance has deteriorated and they have been totally outplayed by India so far.           (PTI)

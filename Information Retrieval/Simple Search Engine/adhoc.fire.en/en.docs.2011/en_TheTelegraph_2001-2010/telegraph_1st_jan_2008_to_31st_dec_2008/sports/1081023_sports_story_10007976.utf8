            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: For the four Bengal players in the Challenger Trophy, it will not just be a chance to showcase their talent, but also an opportunity to prove that the states relegation to the Ranji Trophy Plate group last year was just an aberration.         
	Ashok Dinda, who was included in the Rest of India squad for the Irani Trophy, will be part of the India Blue squad, led by Test discard Yuvraj Singh.         
	Manoj Tiwary and Wriddhiman Saha will turn out for India Red, captained by Subramaniam Badrinath.         
	India Green, which has Mohammed Kaif at the helm, includes allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla.         
	This meet is a big opportunity for us before the start of the Ranji season, Tiwary said. Nothing can be better than match practice. A good performance will always help us to stay in the selectors mind.         
	Moreover we have to remember that we will be playing in the Plate division this year. We have to focus on churning out good performances to put the spotlight back on us, Tiwary added.         
	Shukla, too, is raring to go. All of us are going to give of our best Weve to prove that we are up there with the best, said the Bengal captain.         
	Were not putting ourselves under any pressure Well play our natural game and try to impress the selectors, said Shukla.         
	Dinda, who has performed creditably for India A recently, is also looking to continue his good form.         
	The Challenger Trophy will be another chance to keep up the good show. Im not complacent and will only try to improve with every match.         
	The past few months have been good and Im more confident of a good show, the pacer explained.         
	Dinda along with Wriddhiman shot into prominence during the Indian Premier League in April-May. They came out with some superlative displays during the Twenty20 tournament.         
	But the Ranji Trophy campaign had proved to be disastrous with Bengal failing to keep their berth in the Elite group.

	Tiwary will do well: Sourav
 Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary may have failed in his maiden one-day International appearance in Brisbane Sunday, but former captain Sourav Ganguly feels that the right-hander would do well if given more opportunities. ldquo;Such things happen. Not everybody has a good debut. But I rsquo;m hopeful that he will do well if given proper chances, rdquo; Sourav said. ldquo;You don rsquo;t get too many practice games. One has to adjust fast. I am confident that Tiwary will also get used to the conditions quickly, rdquo; said the former India captain, who was present at the CAB Foundation Day.
 Altogether 1097 cricket lovers donated blood to commemorate the occasion.

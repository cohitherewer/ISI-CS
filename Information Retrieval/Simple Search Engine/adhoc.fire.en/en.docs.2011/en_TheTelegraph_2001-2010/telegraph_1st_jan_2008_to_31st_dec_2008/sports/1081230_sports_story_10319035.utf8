The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Balaji is too hot for Bengal
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Balaji is too hot for Bengal
            JOSEPH HOOVER            Balaji took six for 24                           
	Bangalore: Laxmipathy Balaji produced a remarkable spell of incisive fast bowling to demolish Bengal in their second innings and power Tamil Nadu into the Ranji Trophy semi-finals. The wicket had little to offer, but the smiling assassin scythed through the Bengal batting in a jiffy this morning (8-5-7-6) to finish with awe-inspiring overall figures of six for 24.         
	Bengal collapsed like a house of cards as Balaji, bowling from the far end, produced one lethal beauty after another.         
	 Ejecting skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla on his overnight score (47), Balaji castled Ritam Kundu (21), Arindam Das (3) and Sourav Sarkar (7) before luring Ashok Dinda into top-edging an intended pull.         
	Ravaged by the determined Balaji  who returned to competitive cricket last year after a crippling back injury had kept him out of the game for nearly two seasons  Bengal could scarcely add 43 to their overnight 134 for four, leaving Tamil Nadu to get 227 for an outright win from 68 overs.         
	Cashing in Bengals largesse, Tamil Nadu made the target without breaking a sweat as Murali Vijay (73) and Abhinav Mukund (31) posted 84 runs in their opening stand.         
	Subramaniam Badrinath (92 not out) and Dinesh Karthik (16 not out)  who continued to baffle with his yes-no-wait-yes-no frenzied running between the wickets  ensured there were no more hiccups as Tamil Nadu won by eight wickets. In the process, they set up a semi-final date with Uttar Pradesh (January 4-7) in Nagpur.         
	With the wicket continuing to play flat and Bengal determined to consolidate their first innings lead, Tamil Nadus hopes rested on Balajis broad shoulders. The 27-year-old, who had produced a similar spell (11.2-5-47-5) against Baroda in the league phase, responded to the distress call, having Shukla caught behind with the 17th ball of the day. Next to go was Kundu, who had his citadel rattled.         
	Arindam and Sarkar went in similar fashion, even as Rohan Banerjee despondently watched from the non-strikers end.         
	Given a soft target and the comfort of a deep batting line-up, Mukund, who took his seasons tally to 756 runs from seven matches (average 84), and Vijay batted without a care in the world.         
	They were right on top of the attack, creaming Ranadeb Bose and Dinda through the off with lan. Vijay was the more attacking of the two, punishing Dinda, who traded pace for direction.         
	However, Bengal struck in the post-lunch session when Sarkar breached Mukunds defence, the ball hitting the top of the off stump.         
	The breakthrough seemed to pep Bengal up, as Sarkar and Bose pressed for another wicket, hitting Badrinath and Vijay frequently on their pads. Bose was to be rewarded when Vijay distantly drove at him for Manoj Tiwary to gleefully accept the offer at first slip.         
	Having held sway for three days, Bengal watched listlessly as Badrinath, who grew in confidence as the day wore on, and Karthik coasted to the target.         
	It was a poor commentary on Bengal that they sought to concede runs through wides, wantonly bowling down the leg side to deprive Badrinath of a possible hundred.

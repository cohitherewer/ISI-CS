	Mysore: S. Ganapathy-trained Star Wave may be hard to beat in the nine-horse field lined up for the 2,000m Poonawalla Mysore Derby here on Sunday. The Placerville-La Bonne Vie filly not only boasts of her endurance power to negotiate the slated trip, she is also blessed with a good finishing speed. Jockey B. Prakash partners the filly, who came with an electrifying run from the rear of the field to win the Mysore 1,000 Guineas.

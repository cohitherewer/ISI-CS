                                                Sania decision pains Vijay
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Former Davis Cup captain Vijay Amritraj is disappointed that Sania Mirza will not participate in the WTA Open in Bangalore this year.         
	Its strange that such things have happened with her, Amritraj said after the Davis Cup draw here on Thursday. She is a player who is capable of figuring among the top 20 in the world.         
	Amritraj regretted that Sania decided not to play in India at a crucial juncture of her career. She was in terrific form in the Australian Open against Venus Williams.         
	At the moment she has a good chance of beating the top seeded players of the world. You have to take care of chances like that in front of the home crowd. It lifts your game. Nothing is more exciting for a player than playing in front of home crowd.         
	Sania, according to Amritraj, will have to weigh all pros and cons before taking any decision. Sania needs to make the right calls. As a sportsperson, she should not have any regrets at the end.         
	Amritraj was confident that Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi would do well at the Beijing Olympics. The two have not been playing together for sometime now. But that will not make any difference. They may be little rusty in the beginning, but they know each others game for a long time.         
	The former captain, however, said that Paes and Bhupathi will have to sort out their differences to lift their performance.         
	Mahesh and Leander had certain differences in the past. It has to be sorted out. Sitting on the opposite side of the bench wont help.

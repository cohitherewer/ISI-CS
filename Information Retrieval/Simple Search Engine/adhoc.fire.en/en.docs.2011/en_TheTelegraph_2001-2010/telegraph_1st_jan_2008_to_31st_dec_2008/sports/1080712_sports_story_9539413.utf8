	Akram slams Shoaib Malik  New Delhi: Clearly not convinced by Shoaib Malik rsquo;s leadership abilities, former captain Wasim Akram feels that the present Pakistan skipper is weak and has failed to back his players. Akram was particularly irked by Malik rsquo;s comments during the Asia Cup that he was only playing with the XI which the selectors had handed over to him. Akram said selection in Pakistan is always a politicised affair but Malik needed to put his foot down if he had some other ideas.    
	 SLC move  Colombo: Sri Lanka has allowed its cricketers to play in next year rsquo;s Indian Premier League (IPL) at the expense of their Test series against England, prompting a word of caution from ICC advising players not to fall for the lure of easy money.

	 Watson rsquo;s view   Melbourne: Australian allrounder Shane Watson says he is so desperate to keep his place in the Australian side that he would not mind ignoring security concerns to play in Pakistan for the Champions Trophy. ldquo;I rsquo;d go anywhere, I rsquo;d play anywhere, rdquo; he was quoted as saying in a Australian daily.

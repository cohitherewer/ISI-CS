	Manchester: Monty Panesar took five wickets for 31 in an England revival on the third afternoon of the second Test at Old Trafford but the Black Caps still held the advantage with a lead of 278 runs on a difficult batting pitch.         
	New Zealand reached 99 for six at tea on Sunday with Kyle Mills on four and Jacob Oram on two. Oram came in at eight because of a shoulder and neck injury, while Daniel Flynn was still recovering from being struck in the mouth.         
	Left-arm spinner Panesar, bowling from the same end that Vettori earlier claimed 5-66, bagged Jamie How (29), James Marshall (28), Brendon McCullum (0), Ross Taylor (15) with all lbw and had Vettori caught. Taylors wicket was his fifth and 100th Test victim.         
	The New Zealand batsmen battled with the increasing bounce and spitting turn that Panesar was extracting, as Englands batters had earlier experienced against Vettori.         
	James Anderson took the first wicket when he had Aaron Redmond (6) caught by Paul Collingwood at a wide second slip.         
	Vettori had earlier put New Zealamd in command after his five wickets sparked an England collapse. (Reuters)

            A STAFF REPORTER                  Tanmay Srivastava (top) and Sreevats Goswami                           
	Calcutta: An unbeaten 83 by Tanmay Srivastava helped India register a thumping 195-run win over Papua New Guinea (PNG) in their opening encounter of the ICC Under-19 World Cup at the Kinrara Oval in Malaysia Sunday, according to an ICC release.         
	The Uttar Pradesh southpaw was the backbone of the India batting as Tanmay, batting at No. 3, helped India pile up 280 for five.         
	His 76-ball knock included seven boundaries and three sixes.         
	However the start was provided by Calcutta boy Sreevats Goswami (58 off 96 balls), who put up an 100-run opening wicket partnership with Turuwar Kohli.         
	The Jalandhar-born, Kohli made 40 off 53 balls which included six hit to the fence. Wicketkeeper-batsman, Sreevats, also hit six boundaries.         
	Skipper Virat Kohli made a quick 40 from 40 balls.         
	The Delhi batsman engaged himself with a 71-run third-wicket partnership with Tanmay.         
	In reply, PNG were skittled out for 85 in 28 overs with left arm spinner Iqbal Abdulla taking three wickets from his three overs, conceding just two runs.         
	Pradeep Sangwan, Ajitesh Argal and Kohli took two wickets apiece. For Papua New Guinea, Alfred Amini top-scored with 26 from 53 balls.

	David Beckham is not surprised by his omission from the England squad and has expressed his support for Fabio Capellos policy of selecting players only on form.         
	Capello explained his decision directly to Beckham, who had been aware of his probable exclusion once LA Galaxy fail to qualify for the MLS play-offs. Beckham, who is one short of Bobby Moores England record for an outfield player of 108 caps, goes to New Zealand with LA Galaxy next month and will then have a short holiday before joining AC Milan in January.         
	His absence will be felt within a squad where he has won respect for the way he has handled the transition from captain to squad player. He cheers you on, gives you plenty of belief, said Theo Walcott.

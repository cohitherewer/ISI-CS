The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India juniors qualify for semi-finals
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India juniors qualify for semi-finals
                      
	San Luis Potosi (Mexico): Yuki Bhambri extended his winning streak and Saurabh Singh registered his first singles win to help India beat Brazil 2-1 and top Group D to qualify for the semi-finals of the Junior Davis Cup here.         
	Both Yuki and Saurabh came from behind to beat their respective opponents in the singles before the combination of Saurabh and Venkata Abhiskeh Sakleshpu lost the inconsequential doubles rubber.         
	Saurabh finally tasted victory when he overcame a bad start to beat Henrique Tsukamoto 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 to give second seeded India a good opening.         
	Yuki then sealed the issue by winning the second singles rubber, defeating Guilherme Clezar 3-6, 6-1, 6-1. (PTI)

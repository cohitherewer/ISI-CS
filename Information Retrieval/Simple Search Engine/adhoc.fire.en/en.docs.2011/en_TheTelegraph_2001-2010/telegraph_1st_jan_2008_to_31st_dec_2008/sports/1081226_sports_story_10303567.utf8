  - Ranji Quarters 
  - Bengal Vs TN
            JOSEPH HOOVER                         
	Bangalore: Tamil Nadu are oozing confidence, given their run in the 2008-09 season, on the eve of their Ranji Trophy quarter final against a resilient Bengal. They believe if they continue to play as well as they have done in the league, they certainly stand a good chance of playing the winners of the Uttar Pradesh-Gujarat tie in the semi-final.         
	Tamil Nadu are backing their confidence with strenuous work at the nets. While Bengal arrived Wednesday night and had a morning nets on a balmy Thursday morning, Tamil Nadu set shop well ahead to prepare in right earnest for what they consider to be a critical game.         
	Having batted Karnataka out of the game in the league at this venue, they know pretty well that it will be the batsmen who will decide the fate of either team in the remainder of the season.         
	And batting is one department they are heavily fortified in, more so with exceptional talent. The return of Murali Vijay, who did exceedingly well on his debut against Australia, bolsters their line-up, which has produced 13 hundreds this season.         
	So deep and strong is their batting that Tamil Nadu are set to drop opener Arun Karthik who had notched two hundreds in four games. Interestingly, Tamil Nadu have garnered a double hundred partnership in each of their games this season, wriggling out of tight situations on two occasions, against Karnataka and Baroda.         
	Clawing their way back into the Super League, Bengal would have to deconstruct Tamil Nadus batting might if they want to continue their dream run this season. But a lot will depend on how Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda and Sourav Sarkar bowl on this lifeless track, where Uttar Pradesh had effortlessly overwhelmed Karnatakas seemingly daunting first innings total of 511 a fortnight ago.         
	Bengal have decided to keep Sreevats Goswami, Iresh Saxena and Avik Mullick out of the XI.         
	Though there will be assistance for the seamers in the early part of the day, the only way to go about on this placid carpet is to bowl a wicket-to-wicket line.         
	Sunil Joshi, who bowled 53 overs while conceding 92 runs in a high scoring match against Uttar Pradesh, had a word of advice for the bowlers. Keep the ball on the stumps. If the batsman misses it, you hit. Bowl a tight line, restrict the runs and allow the batsmen to make a mistake.         
	But for the Bengal bowlers to fire, they would require their batsmen to put substantial runs on the board.         
	Considering that their batting has been plagued by inconsistency, skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Dibyendu Chakraborty, who made 82 and 49 in the Plate Cup semi-final against Goa, the hugely talented Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha and Arindam Das would have to produce big runs.         
	If they dont, it would be a walk in the park for Tamil Nadu who are keen to lay their hands on the coveted trophy.         
	TEAMS         
	Bengal (likely): Arindam Das, Rohan Banerjee, Manoj Tiwary, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha, Avik Chowdhury, Dibyendu Chakraborty, Sourav Sarkar, Ritam Kundu, Ashok Dinda, Ranadeb Bose.

	Umpires: Sudhir Asnani, K K Hariharan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Buchanan: I am not only looking   at tomorrow or the day after
                                                   Buchanan: I am not only looking   at tomorrow or the day after
  -  The coach on the challenges which lie ahead           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                                   John Buchanan      
	Calcutta: John Buchanan was about to call it a day, in Perth, when The Telegraph got through to him on Wednesday.         
	Buchanan, who had an incredibly successful tenure as the Australia coach from late 1999 to April last year, will be coaching the Calcutta outfit (which could be called Nightriders) in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Despite having had a busy day (meeting friends in the corporate world and preparing for a charitable event on Thursday), Buchanan didnt mind taking questions even at a late hour.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether he had a say in the bidding strategy adopted by Team Shah Rukh Khan         
	I did give inputs Obviously, I realised one couldnt have all the players of ones choice because of the auction Also that value for money would be a big factor.         
	The criteria he followed while giving inputs         
	Essentially, I looked at a team which could gel together and be consistent I wouldnt like to take names for obvious reasons but Id asked for experienced batsmen at the top of the order, good pace bowlers and effective spinners Bottomline is that the team has to be balanced It needs depth in batting and the presence of specialist bowlers.         
	On the 10 players (excluding icon Sourav Ganguly) bought at the auction         
	From the list youve read out, I see a nice blend of experience in the form of Ricky Ponting and Chris Gayle and lots of potential by way of somebody like Ishant Sharma The challenge will be to consistently bring the best out of them and its important for everybody to know how they should be playing.         
	Ponting not being available for the inaugural edition of the IPL         
	My understanding was different, but if thats the official line, then         
	The Calcutta captain, Sourav         
	He has loads of experience and Im looking forward to working with him and, of course, with Shah Rukh         
	On who approached him to coach Calcutta         
	The offer actually came from the IPL, on behalf of Shah Rukhs company A dialogue followed.                   
	What tempted him to again wear the coachs hat         
	(Laughs) For one, Twenty20 is an exciting format and has the potential of being played across the world Its going to grow and the window eventually given by the International Cricket Council  April-May or August-September  is going to be critical. Id love to see a Twenty20 World Series being played indoors somewhere To talk of the upcoming assignment, I have a vision and Id like to help build something permanent, by way of a team, for Calcutta We may not win in the first year or the second, but Id definitely like that to happen in the third (and final) year of my contract Indeed, Im not only looking at tomorrow or the day after. (After a pause) Im happy with the catchment area-provision and the fielding of U-22s. Its an opportunity to build a team.         
	The IPL         
	Exciting It has brought together such a diverse group of players It offers a lot for the players, for the TV audiences Id told you in Adelaide (on the eve of the last India-Australia Test) that the IPL is an interesting development and that I was keeping my eyes and ears open.         
	Whether too much money could affect the younger lot, who wouldnt even have dreamt of making millions in a matter of minutes         
	It could, yes Much will depend on how theyre managed Part of our job will be to offer advice and counsel them         
	On whether handling Shoaib Akhtar will actually be his biggest challenge         
	Look, in such a diverse group, there are bound to be players with different temperaments Shoaib brings pace to the table and thats a key element, particularly in Twenty20 cricket I dont foresee a problem as long as Shoaib understands his responsibility, the values and the culture of the team.         
	Whether hell be tempted to return to full-time coaching         
	Dont think so.         
	Finally, on whether hes finalised travel plans         
	Ive got commitments related to my company (Buchanan Success Coaching) and dont think Ill be able to come before April 12-13. When I do, though, Im going to stay till the end of the IPLs first edition.

                                                   Today, there is no place for one who isnt good in the field: Taylor
  -  Former Australia captain picks his dream ODI XI         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                       Mark Taylor    
	Brisbane: Had the Sri Lankans not turned in a superlative performance at the Gaddafi, Mark Taylor wouldve lifted the 1996 World Cup. On Tuesday, the former Australia captain, an icon of the present times, picked his dream ODI XI for the benefit of The Telegraphs readers.         
	The request had been made on Sunday, during the first finals of the tri-series, and so Taylor took his time to get it right.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the criteria adopted in choosing his dream XI         
	Youd handed me a tough assignment The reason being there have been so many such good ODI players I had to select a balanced team and had to keep in mind that today there is no place for one who isnt good in the field Not just that, you need to have a pretty good throwing arm.         
	His dream XI (in batting order)         
	ADAM GILCHRIST: Very destructive against the new ball and a quick scorer whod also keep A tremendous two-in-one cricketer capable of winning you the match in the first 15 overs.         
	SACHIN TENDULKAR: Such a very fine player I was lucky to have played quite a few matches against him and, as captain, found him the hardest to dismiss.         
	MARK WAUGH: Hes at No.3, but could be counted upon to open too Another very fine batsmen capable of hundreds He could field anywhere and bowl medium-paced stuff and off-spin Very handy and I found it impossible to leave him out.         
	SIR VIV RICHARDS: A very destructive batsmen who could hit the quicks into areas where others couldnt Plus, a magnificent fielder I remember he effected a series of run-outs in the 1975 World Cup finals.         
	BRIAN LARA: I may not have picked him in my dream Test XI, because hed always give you the chance to get him out, but Ive had to select him in this team Could adapt and use the pace of the ball very well.         
	RICKY PONTING: A No.6 hes quite low in the batting order, but hes got to be in the XI because of his fantastic record which speaks for itself Remember, hes been part of the Australian team which has won the last three World Cups. And, he captained in the last two.         
	MALCOLM MARSHALL: This was a tough one and I had to choose between Malcolm and Imran Khan Ive gone for Malcolm because he was the more intimidating bowler He was the more damaging bowler.         
	WASIM AKRAM: Hes one of the two best bowlers I faced, the other being Curtley Ambrose Akram did things with the ball which the others couldnt do He could swing the new ball and the old Also, Akram was a very useful lower-order batsman.         
	BRETT LEE: Brett gets in on the strength of his performance in ODIs over the past five years A genuine wicket-taker, a solid fieldsman and a reasonable bat.         
	SHANE WARNE: I dont need to justify his selection in any manner These days, one-day cricket is more about taking wickets and not containment and Shane would be right up there.         
	GLENN MCGRATH: Again, this was a tough one and Ambrose lost out only because Glenn was a slightly better fielder with a stronger throwing arm.         
	Whether he had difficulty leaving out some others besides Imran and Ambrose         
	(Grins) Oh, yes Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes, Michael Bevan and Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock and Muttiah Muralidharan Bevan was such a finisher, but the team Ive picked wouldnt need a Bevan to do that job Actually, had I been making this selection a decade ago, Javed Miandad wouldve definitely been in         
	Finally, his choice for the captaincy         
	Ponting He has a very fine record and has won two World Cups.

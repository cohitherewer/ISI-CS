	Ahmedabad: South Africa captain Graeme Smith believes his side has the wherewithal to take advantage of an injury-plagued Indian side in the second Test.         
	Firing a salvo at Anil Kumble amp; Co. in the ongoing psychological battle, Smith joined his coach Mickey Arthur in saying that their bowlers would pepper Virender Sehwag, who scored a majestic 319 in Chennai, with short-pitched stuff in Motera.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Plans to contain Virender Sehwag         
	As a team it is important to come up with game plans. The pitch will hopefully allow us to do that. We have the option to bowl short at him (Sehwag). We have worked out a few things and hopefully we will be able to execute them over the next five days.         
	The recent successes in the subcontinent (winning Test series in Pakistan and Bangladesh)         
	This side has done well over a period of time. There were many positives for us from the first Test and we are looking for a result here. We are confident of executing our plans. We know their game. It is a challenge to play in subcontinent, playing under different situations and conditions tests a team.         
	Neil McKenzies performance         
	Neil has been fantastic. His comeback is a lesson for South Africa. His experience will lend value to us.         
	Dependence on Makhaya Ntini         
	Ntini is experienced and is a leading fast bowler. It is important for him to lead by example. The way he got the breakthroughs in Chennai speaks a lot about him. He enjoys that role.         
	Team composition         
	We will probably go in with the same team and play only one spinner. We have prepared well and are confident. Its all about us executing our plans.         
	The wicket         
	All cricketers want to see a good wicket, one with a good balance between bat and ball. This wicket looks to be a good one with some grass cover... Looks different from Chennai. It will be difficult to say whether it plays a major role. We will have to wait for it But it will be interesting to see how the heat and other conditions are going to affect the pitch.         
	Injury concerns in the Indian camp         
	After the last game, India have a few more things to think about than us in terms of combination, in terms of the selection of bowlers. So they have to answer our challenges, to make sure we come back down to neutral. If he (Kumble) does not play you will lose a real competitor, someone who can really change a game It makes all the difference. Yuvraj Singh has proved he is a good player but he comes in with huge shoes to fill (in the place of Sachin). Well try to keep that pressure up (on him). Ishant (Sharma) has done well, but he is very new to international cricket.         
	The possibility of V.V.S. Laxman batting up the order         
	It is not easy to bat with the tail. Laxman knows that. The top-order has done well for India, but this wicket may require the lower order batsmen to play a role.

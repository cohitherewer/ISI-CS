                  Graeme Smith en route to his 62 in Dhaka on Sunday                     
	Dhaka: Skipper Graeme Smiths 20th Test half-century and five wickets for Jacques Kallis set South Africa well on the way to victory against Bangladesh at the close of play on the third day of the first Test on Sunday.         
	The visitors were 178 for four wickets, just 27 runs short of the 205 needed to win after bowling Bangladesh out for 182. Ashwell Prince was on 24 and AB de Villiers had made eight at the crease.         
	Kallis took five wickets for 30 in 14 overs as Bangladesh, resuming their second innings on 125 for four could add only 57 runs.         
	Mark Boucher reclaimed the world record for the most Test dismissals by a wicketkeeper with his 417th victim, Mushfiqur Rahim, surpassing the mark held by Australian Adam Gilchrist.         
	Boucher then added his 418th, catching Saqibul Hasan also off Kallis to wrap up the Bangladesh innings.         
	Smith made 62 runs from 104 balls for South Africa, including six boundaries, before he was trapped lbw by spinner Mohammed Rafique, who also removed Hashim Amla (46) caught by Junaid Siddiqui at slip.         
	Shahdat Hossain took the other two South African wickets, removing opener Neil McKenzie for 26, who was caught at square leg by Habibul Bashar, while Mashrafe Mortaza caught Jacques Kallis (7) off the pace bowler.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Renault may back low-cost engine
                                                                                                                                                                                             Renault may back low-cost engine
            [+uc('Tom Cary   THE DAILY TELEGRAPH')+]            Max Mosley                           
	Formula Ones war on costs is heating up. In a potentially decisive break with fellow car manufacturers on the grid, Renault are understood to have expressed an interest in plans to introduce a low-cost standard engine in the sport from 2010.         
	Although the French team declined to comment on Tuesday, a spokesman for world governing body Fia said: There has been a very positive response from the F1 teams regarding our engine proposals.         
	It would be inappropriate to comment on the reaction of any individual team, or give further details, in advance of Fridays [Fia] World Council meeting.         
	Fia president Max Mosley will meet representatives of the Formula One Teams Association to discuss the latest raft of cost-cutting ideas for implementation in 2009 and 2010.         
	Mosley, who wants see annual budgets cut by up to 80 per cent, has given teams until on Wednesday to sign up to his controversial proposals for a standard-specification Cosworth engine from 2010.         
	He insists that a deal will go ahead as long as a minimum of four teams are interested.         
	Independent teams Williams, Force India, Red Bull Racing and Toro Rosso are already believed to have informed the Fia that they are considering the option. But the addition of Renault would be a significant coup for Mosley.         
	It would also mark a significant departure for the car-maker who have supplied engines from their Viry-Chatillon base in France since they returned to F1 in 2001.         
	However, Renault have lost 82.6 per cent of their share price in the economic downturn  more than any other manufacturer  and Flavio Briatores team are now under severe pressure from their parent company to justify their involvement in the sport.         
	A dramatic reduction in costs from 2010 might be the only way of stopping Renault from following Hondas lead.         
	The Japanese car manufacturer pulled out of the sport last Friday citing the economic crisis.         
	Renault team principal Briatore declined to comment on Tuesday but he is known to favour the idea of cutting costs. The Fia have already put a freeze on engine development and, although it will not force manufacturers to run a standard engine from 2010, Mosley has confirmed that any carmakers own power unit will have its performance pegged to that of the standard engine.         
	Regarding the question of the engines, sure we need to cut the costs but for me, all this discussion about Formula One engines, already today, with frozen engines, theoretically there is no development, Briatore said last month. Already today we have no performance [gains] from the engine. If everybody follows the rules, the engine is frozen and nobody is allowed to touch the engine.         
	Renault evidently feel there is little justification in spending tens of millions of pounds on a full-scale engine programme when there is a fully competitive option for less than 6 million.         
	And where Renault has dared to tread, other manufacturers may follow.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

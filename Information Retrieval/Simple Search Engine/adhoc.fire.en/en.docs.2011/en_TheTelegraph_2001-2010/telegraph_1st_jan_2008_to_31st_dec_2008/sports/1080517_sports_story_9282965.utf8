The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I dont think of pressure: Shoaib
                                                                                                                                                                                                       I dont think of pressure: Shoaib
    - This is the best team that Ive been with after the one which reached the 1999 Cup final, says speedster           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shoaib Akhtar                                 
	Mumbai: Shoaib Akhtar was seven minutes late for the Kolkata Knight Riders bus in the early hours of last Saturday, when the team was to catch a flight for Hyderabad. On Thursday morning, though, he was some ten minutes searly.         
	Embarrassed by last weeks delay, Shoaib parked himself in the bus well in advance and began counting those who came after him He has quickly learnt to respect the teams culture, said a member of the Knight Riders management.         
	Shoaib has come to be talked about as Pakistan crickets enfant terrible, but he has been anything but a problem child during nearly a fortnights stay with the Knight Riders.         
	Ive been enjoying myself Ive been made to feel so comfortable Believe me, this is the best team that Ive been with after the one which reached the 1999 World Cup final (under Wasim Akram) That was a great bunch, this is a great bunch, Shoaib told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking in the lead-up to Friday nights face-off against the Mumbai Indians, Shoaib added: Its important for teams to recognise match-winners and to treat them as such The Knight Riders have done so, allowing me to feel absolutely at ease From (owner) Shah Rukh Khan to the captain (Sourav Ganguly) to the coach (John Buchanan) Everybody is making my stint enjoyable Of course, I cant forget the fans         
	According to Shoaib, he felt rather embarrassed when, after his stunning MoM-award winning performance at the Eden on Tuesday, fans began thanking him.         
	Grinning, he said: I felt quite embarrassed because Im being paid to get wickets and help the Knight Riders win matches Theres no need for anybody to thank me.         
	Had he been under pressure at the Eden, not having played at any level for months? No way I dont think of pressure Main pressure leta nahin hoon Just do my work... In fact, I dont even bother about the look of the wicket or the reputation of the batsmen         
	Not even the reputation of a Sachin Tendulkar? Not at all Why should I be concerned with reputations? was Shoaibs counter, as quick as one of his thunderbolts.         
	Shoaib remarked that helping the Ishant Sharmas and the Ashok Dindas was part of his unofficial brief. Ive got over a decade of international experience and, if I can help anybody, Ill gladly do so It could be Ishant or Dinda or somebody else.         
	Clearly, Shoaibs intent on returning to Pakistan with a very different image. The buzz, in any case, is that the five-year ban may actually be lifted.         
	Footnote: Shoaib did get Sachin cheaply, but got mauled by a rampaging Sanath Jayasuriya at the Wankhede. A bad day in office after a terrific one at the Eden.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hit a six and go back to pavilion 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hit a six and go back to pavilion 
                      
	 London: The cricket fans worldwide maybe relishing the rain of sixes in the ongoing Indian Premier League, but a cricket club in the UK has banned its players from hitting sixes  to protect neighbouring home owners.         
	Players at Harrogate Cricket Club in North Yorks have been cautioned that if they hit balls over the boundary towards the neighbouring houses, they will be declared out. The Borough Council, which owns the ground, said it had received complaints from residents.         
	According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, the council has ruled that use of playing strips, including the square, should be restricted to meet the minimum distances allowed. A report from the council says the decisions have been taken to achieve a balance with residents.         
	Mike Rawlings, Harrogate Cricket Club chairman said that the ruling doesnt frustrate the players. As long as everyone knows the rules at the start of the game then you just play to those rules. Most of the neighbours are very supportive of the club, but we have the odd person who complains, he said.   
	Morgan rsquo;s   warning  
	 London: England could lose the right to host the ICC World Twenty20 next year if it continues to deny visas to Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) officials, ICC president-elect David Morgan has warned.         
	When asked whether the ICC could strip England of the hosting rights of the lucrative championship if it continues with its tough stance on Zimbabwe, Morgan said, it could happen.         
	The chairman of Zimbabwe cricket, whoever that may be, will want to come to see the truly wonderful event. My own opinion is that it will go ahead and be staged in England, he told a British newspaper.         
	ZCU chief Peter Chingoka has been denied an England visa on a previous occasion due to his proximity to Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe, who is fiercely opposed by the British government for his human rights record.  
	CA laments  Speed exit  
	 Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) expressed regret on Sunday at the premature end to Malcolm Speeds spell as chief executive of the ICC. Speed, a former CA chief executive, was placed on paid leave by the ICC on Friday after falling out with several board members over various issues within Zimbabwe Cricket.         
	He was scheduled to step down when his contract expired in July.         
	I note with regret that Malcolm Speeds distinguished career as an international cricket administrator has ended in the manner in which it has, CA chairman Creagh Connor said.

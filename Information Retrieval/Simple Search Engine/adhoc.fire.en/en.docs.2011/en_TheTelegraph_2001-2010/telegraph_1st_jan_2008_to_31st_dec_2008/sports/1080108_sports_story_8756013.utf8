                                                   Things could have been handled better: Steve

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh, who guided Australia on their record winning run between 1999 and 2001, said it was a real pity that the Sydney Test will probably be remembered for all the wrong reasons and not for the outstanding quality and drama it provided. 
    
	Waugh said a racial exchange involving Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds  for which the former was eventually banned for three Test matches  could have been handled better. 
    
	Terming it a magnificent Test, Waugh wrote in The Daily Telegraph: This was a game that pushed people to the limit, with umpires having to make crucial and often difficult decisions on a pitch that required enormous concentration and attention to detail, players having their echniques examined in a variety of circumstances and match officials scrambling to decipher the on-field controversy. 
    
	Heading up a catalogue of hot topics was the Harbhajan-Symonds exchange. It quickly spiralled out of control, with emotions overriding the need to think clearly and concisely about the ramifications. A better resolution may have been for both players, captains, coaches to get together and work out a solution before they went past the point of no return, Waugh said. 
    
	He added sledging between the teams that eventually led to the verbal altercation has the potential to affect relations between the countries. At the centre of most incidents between cricketing nations is the clash or lack of understanding of each others cultures. Teams playing against Australia fail to understand that banter, gamesmanship, sledging or whatever anyone would like to call it is just the way Australian kids joust and play... 
    
	On the other hand Aussie teams cant stomach time-wasting tactics and perceived manipulation of the rules, including calling for runners, over-appealing and the alleged altering of the balls condition. The humour is also different, particularly to India, where there is a childlike innocence and mimicry we sometimes confuse as intimidating and aggressive, he added. 
    
	On the alleged use of the word monkey, he said: If Harbhajan did say it, it is puerile and stupid after he was warned in the recent one-day series. Clearly this can be viewed as racist but many on the subcontinent see it as their way of taking the mickey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni can become an all-time great: Dexter
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dhoni can become an all-time great: Dexter
    - Pietersen has to learn how to handle slow bowlers, says former captain           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ted Dexter in the city on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Team Indias Mahendra Singh Dhoni has the qualities to become one of the all-time great captains.         
	That, at least, is the view held by Edward Ted Dexter, who led England in the early 1960s. In fact, he captained in 30 Tests and finished with more wins than losses (nine-seven).         
	In the city on a private visit, Dexter told The Telegraph on Tuesday: When Dhonis on the field, you know who is leading... He has a presence and definitely possesses the qualities to become an all-time great. The team believes in what Dhoni, who has had a wonderful start, does... Over a period, though, hell have to live with the good times and bad.         
	Dexter, who hasnt lost any of the regal air which set him apart on and off the cricket field, added: Dhonis calm, even under pressure, and is a beautiful wicketkeeper besides being a good batsman... A specialist batsman could hit a bad patch, but Dhoni has an additional string to his bow... He belongs, you know... I get the impression that, as captain, he wants to keep learning, which is a nice quality to have.         
	Among other things, Dhonis handling of quick Ishant Sharma and leggie Amit Mishra has impressed Dexter in a big way.         
	The biggest challenge for Dhoni will, of course, be having to manage without Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman at some point in the future.         
	All three may leave the game around the same time, which will make it difficult for Dhoni... At the moment he has a good team and a captains job does become easy when he has high-quality players at his disposal... Some could say Dhoni has all the luck, but theres enough of that going around... You need to catch it at the right time, Dexter said, smiling.         
	[For the record, Dhoni has won four of his five Tests (the other was drawn) at the helm. In ODIs, its 24 from 41.]         
	England captain Kevin Pietersen, on the other hand, has a few things to learn. One, clearly, is how to get the best out of slower bowlers like Monty Panesar.         
	Frankly, Pietersen didnt have a clue how to handle Panesar in the recent Test series (against India)... He wasnt given the time and space to get into rhythm... Im not sure whether Pietersen captained at school or in university... Usually, such grounding helps, Dexter pointed out.         
	Perhaps, yes, but Pietersen has to learn on the job. Quickly too. Today, he just doesnt have a choice.

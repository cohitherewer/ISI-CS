	Ipoh: Riding two goals by Diwakar Ram, India made a fine rally from one goal deficit to outclass lowly Canada 3-1 and keep themselves in contention in the Azlan Shah Cup on Sunday.         
	India dominated the proceedings getting nine penalty corners as against two by their opponents but trailed 0-1 at the breather only to bounce back strongly in the second session with their forwards for once showing the bite in their attack.         
	India could have scored more but for the Canadian goalkeeper Mike Mahoot bringing out some fine saves under the bar.         
	Canada took the lead in the ninth minute from their second penalty corner with Wayne Fernandezs firm push sailing high into the net at the left side of Indian goalkeeper Adrian DSouza.         
	India equalised in the 45th minute with Diwakar Ram converting a penalty stroke which was awarded after SV Sunils goal-bound push following Indias fourth penalty corner hit a Canadian defender. Diwakar, replacing Sandeep who was hit on his right leg by a powerful penalty corner shot, sent the Canadian goalkeeper on the wrong foot.         
	Nineteen-year-old Diwakar scored again in the 51st minute to put India ahead from their seventh penalty corner with a fine low push and the agile Canadian goalkeeper dived full length to his right but failed to stop the ball from finding the cage.         
	Two minutes later, India had a two-goal cushion from a combined team effort. Captain Sardara Singhs free hit touched the stick of Sunil and rolled towards Shivendra Singh who gently tapped the ball into the open goal.         
	The Canadians pressed hard late in the second-half, but their shots were wayward. Innocent Kullu and Gurbaj Singh brought some goalline saves in this spell to keep Indias lead intact.

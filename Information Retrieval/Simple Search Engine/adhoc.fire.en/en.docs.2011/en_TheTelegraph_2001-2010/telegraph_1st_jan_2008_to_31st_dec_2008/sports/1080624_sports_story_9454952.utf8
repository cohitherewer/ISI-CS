The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Supersub Fabregas loving it
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Supersub Fabregas loving it
                      
	Neustift (Austria): Being given the responsibility of taking the crucial penalty in the shootout victory against Italy gave Cesc Fabregas the chance to dispel any doubts about his ability to produce the goods for Spain.         
	It has been difficult for some people to have confidence in me when I play for Spain, but I know that life sometimes gives you the chance to prove yourself, Fabregas told a news conference at Spains training base on Monday. People have been discussing my role in the team and my status as a substitute, so scoring that goal meant a huge amount to me.         
	After Sundays match at Ernst Happel Stadium had ended in a 0-0 stalemate after extra time, Fabregas was chosen by coach Luis Aragones for Spains fifth penalty despite the fact that he does not take them for his English Premier League club Arsenal. Although teammate Dani Guiza missed his spot kick, keeper Iker Casillas saved those from Italys Daniele De Rossi and Antonio Di Natale, giving Fabregas the chance to clinch a place in the semifinals with his penalty.         
	The boss came on to the pitch and gave the names out, said the midfielder. Ive always felt that he has faith in me, and he showed that by naming me number five which is normally the crucial penalty. I just wanted to shoot to score so that everything could come to an end. I wanted to make him (Gianluigi Buffon) think I would shoot to the left as I do in training and then I put it to the right. It was my first penalty in a match since I was 15.         
	Aragones said he chose Fabregas because I knew he was going to score. Fabregas, who has started on the bench for three of Spains four matches at Euro 2008, said he was content with the supersub role given to him by Aragones as long as it benefited the team. I just want to help the team and if that means coming on in the last half hour that is fine, he said. I dont want the glory just for myself, I want it for Spain.

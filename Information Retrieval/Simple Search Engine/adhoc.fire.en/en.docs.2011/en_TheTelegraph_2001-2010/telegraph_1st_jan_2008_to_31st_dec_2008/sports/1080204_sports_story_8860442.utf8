      PRAVESH GUPTA
   
	Mumbai: Trainer S. S. Shahs less-fancied Hotstepper stayed best of the 19 runners over the 2,400m strip to win the McDowell Indian Derby on Sunday. The jinx about favourites failing to lift the Derby, therefore, continues for the eighth year in a row.
     
	However, it was not an easy win for the Irish jockey, Mick Kinane, who was specially flown in to do the duty on the 10-1 shot after he ran close behind trainer S. Ganapathys 14-10 favourite, Bourbon King, in the Indian 2,000 Guineas. The King, however, failed, leaving his stable-filly, Sweeping Success, to battle it out with the winner. In fact, jockey B. Prakashs low level of confidence in recent months may have worked against his interest at the vital end.
     
	Sweeping Success, who was always in a striking position upfront, had shot into a length lead 300m from home. Lying fourth or fifth early in the race, Hotstepper was brought close on the flanks of the filly inside the last furlong. Hundred fifty metres from home, the two horses were going stride for stride but Kinane found the post literally in the final stride. A neck separated the two horses but that was not the end to the thriller as an equal verdict behind was a late finishing Noble Prince, trained by S. Padmanabhan whos much touted Retribution (Frankie Dettorie-up) was nowhere in sight.
     
	Bourbon King placed fourth, about two lengths behind but the favourite was lucky to get the un-remunerative berth, thanks to jockey C. Alford having to shift Regal Connection from rails to the wide out in the last 150m to avoid the weakening front runners. In the process, the Calcutta challenger lost some vital ground and finished fifth, a proverbial whisker behind Bourbon King.
     
	It was second Indian Derby for trainer Shah who in past had saddled Beyond Tomorrow to victory. For jockey Kinane it was his third Derby Indian win. The first one was in the year 1986 when Cordon Bleu carried Vijay Mallyas colours to victory.

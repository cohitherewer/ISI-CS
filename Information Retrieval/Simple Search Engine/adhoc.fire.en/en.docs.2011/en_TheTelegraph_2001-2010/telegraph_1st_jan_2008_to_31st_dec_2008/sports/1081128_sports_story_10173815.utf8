	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting said the Mumbai terror attacks have caused massive concerns among players and the Champions League should be shifted to another country.         
	Ponting said the players were disturbed by what happened in Mumbai, one of the Champions League venues, but since everyone wanted the event to go ahead, the only way out was to stage it in another country.         
	That has been the whole talk around the breakfast room this morning and certainly even at the start of training was about this incident, Ponting said at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday.         
	It goes to show the level of concern that were showing towards it. Everyone whos playing in the event or wants to see the event do well would like to see it go ahead. So if that means moving it to a different country, then I guess Id support that, he said.         
	Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, meanwhile, said he was terrified to see the terror events . It is so terrifying to watch, so I can imagine what the people caught in the middle of these attacks must have felt, he said.

	Im looking forward to bowling to the Indian top-order... Its a strong one... Sachin Tendulkars the best in the line-up and Id really like to bowl to him... Ive waited all my career for this tour and Ive come with the determination to do well... Indias the best place for a spinner to test his skills... It had been nice to go to Pakistan, earlier in the season, and do well there... Ive prepared well and Ive got plans for the Indian batters... Ive got a spinning coach at home, Richard Pybus (who has coached Pakistan) and hes helped me a lot... I enjoy bowling long spells...

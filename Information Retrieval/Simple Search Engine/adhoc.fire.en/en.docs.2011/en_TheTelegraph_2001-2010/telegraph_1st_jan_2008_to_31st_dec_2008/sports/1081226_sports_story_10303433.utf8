The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New fitness regime for Brett Lee
                                                                                                                                                                                                     New fitness regime for Brett Lee
                      
	Melbourne: In a bid to regain his lost form, Australian pace spearhead Brett Lee has designed a new fitness programme on the lines of Olympic sprinters.         
	Lee insists that his best is yet to come as he prepares himself to gain the membership of the 400 Test wicket club.         
	The 32-year-old fast bowler, who has 310 Test wickets, had been facing severe criticism for his unimpressive show in India recently.         
	In a bid to revive his career, Lee, who scalped just one wicket in the first Test against South Africa in Perth, has prepared a training schedule just like that of an Olympic sprinter with the help of Australian teams fitness coach, Stuart Karppinen.         
	I want to compare myself to an elite Olympic athlete. The Olympic sprinters dont peak until they are 33 to 35 years old. Thats the way I have been structuring my program with Stuart Karppinen, Lee was quoted as saying.         
	Olympic sprinters have a very similar make-up to mine as far as the fast-twitched fibres, the way that your body is structured.         
	I dont see any reason that, when I have just turned 32, I cant improve on my pace. I am eyeing 400 Test wickets. I would love to go past the great Dennis Lillee and (South African quick) Allan Donald, who was my idol growing up. That is a goal I have set myself, he added.

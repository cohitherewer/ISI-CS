The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Differences not a worry: Mahesh
                                                       Differences not a worry: Mahesh
                  Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi                     
	New Delhi: Indian ace Mahesh Bhupathi admitted that Leander Paes and he did not see eye to eye on many issues but said it was not a matter of concern as long as they were giving their best together on the court.         
	... It is unfortunate that there are too many issues which obviously we dont see eye to eye on and you know at the end of the day as long as we can put our best foot forward playing for India that is what everybody cares for, Bhupathi said.         
	It was a mixture of things, small and large, which snowballed into what it is today, Bhupathi told a TV channel.         
	Despite their differences, Bhupathi and Paes have decided to team up for India again in Beijing, having finished fourth in the Athens Olympics four years ago.         
	The former world No. 1 pair, nicknamed the Indian Express, won three Grand Slam titles together between 1999 and 2001 but have had a turbulent relationship for several years.         
	They have not played together since December, 2006, when they won the Asian Games doubles gold medal in Doha, after which they announced that they would never play together again.         
	Their quarrel in Qatar was a public affair, with both members of the former Davis Cup pairing criticising each other after Paes questioned Bhupathis fitness and commitment following Indias early exit from the mens team event.           (PTI)

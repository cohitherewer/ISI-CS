	New Delhi: Prakash Amritraj stunned seventh seed Frank Dancevic in a gruelling three-setter to become the first Indian in a decade and only the second wild card in the tournament history to enter the finals of $385,000 Hall of Fame tennis championships in Newport, United States, according to information reaching here..         
	The California-based Indian Davis Cupper upset his Canadian rival 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-3 in a battle lasting two hours and 18 minutes to join Australian Mark Philippoussis, who went on to clinch the title in 2006, as the only other wild card to make the Newport finals.         
	Giant-killer Prakash will now be up against second seed and defending champion Fabrice Santoro, who beat Vince Spadea 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 in the other semi-final, in the summit clash.         
	The 24-year-old Prakash is the first Indian to reach an ATP final since Leander Paes won the 1998 Newport title. Prakashs hard-fought win was watched by his illustrious father Vijay Amritraj, who clinched three of his 16 ATP titles at Newport.         
	If Prakash beats Santoro on Sunday, it would not just give him his maiden ATP title and a pay cheque of $64,000 but would also make him and Vijay just the second father-son duo to have won an ATP title.         
	In 2002, in Newport, Taylor Dent won the title, joining his dad Phil as the first father-son duo to have won ATP titles.         
	Prakash has a 6-1 season record after posting wins this week over Joseph Sirianni, Jesse Levine, qualifier Rohan Bopanna and Dancevic.         
	His previous best ATP result came last year at Newport only, where he reached the quarter finals. (PTI)

	Mumbai: Sanath Jayasuriya is excited to open with Sachin Tendulkar, saying Mumbai Indians have the potential to win the inaugural Indian Premier League.         
	I am looking forward to playing in the tournament and helping Mumbai Indians win the title. It would be a great thing in my career to open with Sachin, the best player in the world. I am really happy to open with him, said Jayasuriya over a teleconference from Sri Lanka.         
	I met up with him in Hobart during the one-day series in Australia and discussed the IPL. I always love to play for my country, but this is different with all teams having a mixture of players from various countries. I would give my best for Mumbai, said the former Sri Lanka captain.         
	Describing the Mumbai Indians squad as a strong one, he pointed out that apart from himself and Sachin, the team had retired South African allrounder Shaun Pollock, Dilhara Fernando and young Indian batsman Robin Uthappa.

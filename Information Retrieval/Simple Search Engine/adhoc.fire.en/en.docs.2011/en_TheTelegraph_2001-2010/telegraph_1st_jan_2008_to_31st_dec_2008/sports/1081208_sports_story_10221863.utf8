            A STAFF REPORTER            Beto                           
	Calcutta: Ranty Martins and Roberto Beto Mendes Silva scored two goals each while Joaquim Abranches netted one as Dempo thrashed 10-man United SC 5-0 to move to the top of group A of the 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Sunday. Dempo, with two outright wins now have six points.         
	Ranty scored his first in the 34th minute and converted another in the 64th after Abranches drew first blood for the Goans in the 22nd minute.         
	Brazilian medio Beto, volleyed the third one eight minutes into second half and sealed the fate of the match with a clinical header in time added on.         
	The local boys started on a positive note with Snehasish Chakraborty making ambitious forays down the left flank. However, his colleagues  Sankar Oraon and Soumik Chakraborty  were listless as usual. Slowly they were outpaced by their opponents and seemed to have lost the plot.         
	Had the duo been a little active United SC could have taken the lead in the eighth minute, but an exceptional Snehasish Chakraborty cross from the left went begging.         
	Uniteds defence manned by their Nigerian duo of Ayeni Bidemi Daniel and Louis Nigi Ebami were a clueless lot. The half-fit Ranty sneaked past with ease.         
	In the 22nd minute a 30-yard free-kick by Beto witnessed Abranches fooling United SC defenders and slotting home the opener.         
	Ranty, took another 12 minutes to nod home the second one. It was again the in-form Abranchess centre from the right that left the four defenders surprised and the opportunistic Ranty put it home with a header.         
	Bhattacharjee tried to amend things and replaced Soumik Chakraborty with M. Subhas Singh. However things deteriorated for him as eight minutes from the lemon break Beto produced a moment of magic.

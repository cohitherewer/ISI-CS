            JOHN LEY            Fenerbahces Deivid (left) celebrates his goal against Chelsea as teammate Mehmet Marco Aurelio looks on at Sukru Saracoglu Stadium in Istanbul on Wednesday                           
	Chelseas Champions League dream was punctured on an improbable and dramatic night in the cauldron that is the Sukru Saracoglu stadium. Leading by an early own goal from Fenerbahces Deivid, Chelsea conceded their first in 11 hours 26 minutes of European football to a player born in Leytonstone, schooled in Walthamstow and given his early chance at Burys Gigg Lane, and then lost the lead to a villain turned hero.         
	Colin Kazim-Richards, known in Turkey as Kazim Kazim, came on in the 54th minute and, within 11 minutes, had given Fenerbahce hope of remaining in the competition (as reported in Thursdays late City edition). The story is an improbable one; he was signed by Brighton after a fan won a Coca-Cola sponsored competition he is known as the Coca Cola Kid  to give club 250,000 to buy a player.         
	And when, in the 81st minute Deivid unleashed a 30-yard drive into the top left-hand corner, Fenerbahce could rightly feel confident of progressing to the semi-finals and leaving the position of Avram Grant in question.         
	The game was turned on its head when Kazims-Richards latched onto Mehmet Aurelios long pass, left Ricardo Carvalho in his wake with one touch to control and another to finish. If that rattled Chelsea, they were torn apart by a quite stunning second goal.         
	Having handed Chelsea the advantage, Deivid redeemed himself when he struck a wonderful right-foot drive beyond Carlo Cudicini to turn this part of Istanbul to a cacophony of noise and celebration. Next Tuesdays return will be fascinating.         
	Grant recalled Frank Lampard, fit after recovering from a virus, for his 50th appearance in the Champions League, and kept faith with Didier Drogba in attack, leaving former Fenerbahce striker Nicolas Anelka having to settle for a substitutes role.

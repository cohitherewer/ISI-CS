The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bayern, too, can be kept under control
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Bayern, too, can be kept under control

	The arrival of Bayern Munich on Sunday reminded me of the Mohun Bagan-Cosmos match in 1977. There was huge demand for tickets in Calcutta during the match, mainly because of Peles presence in the North American side. Cosmos werent as famous as the German club, but the team had an array of former World Cup stars like Pele and Carlos Alberto.        
	I was the Mohun Bagan coach then and had just lost the Calcutta league title to East Bengal. The red and yellow brigade inflicted a decisive 2-0 defeat on us and readers can well imagine my plight during that period. Mohun Bagan were also scheduled to play the IFA Shield final against East Bengal within a week after the Cosmos match. I was in a dilemma whether to concentrate on the Cosmos match or the Shield final.        
	In the end, I decided to first focus on the Cosmos match. My boys were determined to unfold their soccer skills in front of King Pele. Before the start, I left special instructions for Mohammed Habib and Gautam Sarkar to keep an eye on Pele. The duo were told to go for a final tackle on Pele everytime he would receive the ball. They stuck to their task so well that the three-time World Cup winner couldnt play his natural game and had to be replaced in the 62nd minute.        
	The soggy conditions at Eden Gardens that afternoon was one of the reasons why Pele had an immensely forgettable outing against us. But then, one shouldnt overlook the fighting spirit that my boys displayed that day. All of them, including goalkeeper Shibaji Banerjee showed tremendous vigour to achieve a 2-2 result.        
	On Tuesday, I would expect Mohun Bagan to show the same courage and character against Bayern Munich. I know that the Germans have 11 professionals in their side that includes great Oliver Kahn but with little tactical sense, Bayern, too, can be kept under control. No doubt that this Bagan side doesnt have the skill and experience of the team that played against Cosmos but Satyajit Chatterjee can still make the team leave the Salt Lake Stadium with their heads held high.        
	Organising the defence should be Satyajits first and foremost task. He should try and draw the rivals out of their area and play the game in the Bagan half. With a well-knit defence, the Bavarians could be frustrated, as they wont be able to take the ball beyond a level. It may sound simple but Satyajit would require a firm strategic gameplan to execute it.        
	Let Mohun Bagan play with one forward only. The striker should be instructed not to remain static and move constantly around the opponents half. And should Bagan decide to attack, it must be done in great speed. Things should be finished as fast as possible as at no point of time the locals should feel outnumbered in their own half.        
	Like all football fans, I am also eagerly looking forward to watch Kahn play under the Bayern bar. On television, I have seen him make some splendid saves. So, to watch him at the Salt Lake Stadium should be a great experience.        
	I have full respect for Kahn but he is certainly not the best I have seen in my football career. To me, former Soviet Union goalkeeper Lev Yashin is still the greatest ever. I had the privilege of practising with him for a few days during the 1956 Olympics and watched him from close quarters. At times, he was simply incredible.        
	A whole lot of goalkeepers in Calcutta in the 50s and 60s were greatly influenced by Yashin. Peter Thangaraj picked up the style of throwing the ball from Yashin, who was then called the black octopus. In fact, Sanath Seth was the first goalkeeper in Calcutta who used to wear a cap during matches. He had picked up this habit from Yashin.

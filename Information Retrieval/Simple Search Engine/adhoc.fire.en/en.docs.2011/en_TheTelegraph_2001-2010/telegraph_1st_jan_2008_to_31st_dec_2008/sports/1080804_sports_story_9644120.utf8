	If there is one story that is certain to dominate the Beijing Olympics, it is Michael Phelps quest to go one better than Mark Spitz by winning eight gold medals in the pool. And in China, the number eight signifies good fortune and prosperity.         
	Thanks to the financial muscle of NBC, the American public will be able to follow it stroke by stroke. Phelps, an unlikely TV superstar with his unassuming, boy-next-door manner, was the catalyst for NBC to pressurise the International Olympic Committee into flipping the swimming programme so that heats would be swum in the evening in Beijing and finals in the morning, which coincides with prime time in the United States.         
	The howls of protest at such a revolutionary change could be heard from Britain to Australia, but the US network, whose rights deal effectively bankrolls the Olympic movement, won the day.         
	How those NBC executives who negotiated the deal must be rubbing their hands now. At the recent US Olympic trials meet in Omaha, Phelps, 23, broke two world records on his way to qualifying for five individual events in first place. With three further swims in the relays, the magic No 8 remains a real possibility.         
	Even Spitz, king of the pool for 36 years since winning seven gold medals at the Munich Olympics, is preparing for his abdication.         
	I would say he has a great chance of doing it, Spitz said. I would expect you are going to see him win by margins and set times that have never been done before. Hell be unbelievable.         
	I think this is a marvellous time for Michael Phelps. Im hoping he embraces this opportunity and relishes it. Im happy to pass the baton.         
	Phelps himself is more reluctant to go into detail about numbers of golds, understandably so given that he will be reliant on relay team-mates to keep his hopes of a clean sweep alive, but he is certainly not playing down his prospects.         
	I dont think anything is too high, he said. The only way to think like that is if you put limits on yourself. The more you use your imagination, the faster you go. If you think about doing the unthinkable, you can. The sky is the limit.         
	Of the five individual events in which Phelps will race in Beijingthe 200m freestyle, 100m butterfly, 200m butterfly, 200m individual medley and 400m individual medleyhe holds world records in all but one. The one mark missing from his collection is the 100m butterfly, which belongs to fellow American Ian Crocker.         
	The big unknown is the relays, in which a false start by one of his US team-mates could end the dream. Phelps has been there before, since his quest to win eight world titles in Melbourne last year was scuppered by Crockers false start in the 4x100m-medley relay. Instead, he went home with seven world golds, becoming the first swimmer since Spitz to do so at a global championship.         
	But if Phelps chances of becoming the most successful athlete at a single Olympic Games are in the hands of others, the record of winning most gold medals across more than one Games looks certain to fall to him.         
	That honour is shared by Spitz, fellow-American Carl Lewis, Finnish athlete Paavo Nurmi and Russian gymnast Larissa Latynina, all of whom won nine Olympic golds in their careers. Phelps already has six from Athens in 2004.           THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

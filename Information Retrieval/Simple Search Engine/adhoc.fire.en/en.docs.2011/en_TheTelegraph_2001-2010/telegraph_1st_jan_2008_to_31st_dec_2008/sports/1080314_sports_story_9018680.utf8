                                                   Angry Andre Nel weighs options
                      
	Durban: Andre Nels exclusion from the Test squad for the series in India has given rise to a fresh controversy in South African cricket with the tall paceman reportedly considering his future with the national side.         
	Nel was omitted from the South Africa squad to take on India in three Tests starting in Chennai on March 26 and his spot has gone to Charl Langeveldt, a player of colour.         
	Nel did not turn up to receive his Man of the Match award for his spell of four for 27 against Bangladesh in South Africas seven-wicket victory on Wednesday.         
	According to reports, Nel has expressed deep disappointment at being dropped for the India tour and had initially refused to play in Wednesdays one-dayer but was eventually persuaded to do so by the team management.         
	It is understood that Nel, 30, is now considering his future with South African cricket and is seriously thinking of joining the rebel ICL. Team manager Logan Naidoo told a newspaper that he hopes Nel would not take any hasty decision.

	Hyderabad: Dhawal Kulkarni restricted Australia A to 82 for three with a fine spell of two wickets for 22 runs on the first day of the three day unofficial Test match against India A here on Tuesday.         
	On a day that the match was delayed by five hours due to a wet outfield following heavy overnight rains, Aussie Captain Simon Katich won the toss and chose to bat first.         
	Kulkarni, however, struck early, packing off Philip Hughes for four runs.

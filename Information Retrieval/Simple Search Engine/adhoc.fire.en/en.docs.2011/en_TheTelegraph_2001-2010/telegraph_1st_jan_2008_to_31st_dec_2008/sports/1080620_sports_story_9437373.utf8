The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kapil Dev reveals bubbly 83 secret
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kapil Dev reveals bubbly 83 secret
  - It was all about self-belief, says iconic former captain       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kapil Dev                                 
	Calcutta: Smug in the belief that a hattrick of World Cup wins was in their grasp, Clive Lloyds men stocked their dressing room with champagne.         
	The date: June 25, 1983; the venue: Lords, of course.         
	Clearly, given the West Indies awesome standing in the world of cricket at that point in time, the move wouldnt have surprised anybody.         
	Somewhat of a surprise, though, is that there were around half-a-dozen bottles of champagne in Indias dressing room!         
	I definitely carried one in my bag and Im certain some of the others, Sandeep Patil for example, also brought along champagne bottles Wed been quietly confident that day, you know, Kapil told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from New Delhi on Thursday, he added: Actually, even if wed lost the final, we would have celebrated After all, wed done very well to make the title-round when nobody had given us a chance.         
	According to Kapil, self-belief made the biggest difference. The tide began turning in our favour, and appreciably, once we ourselves realised we had the potential and ability to go the distance That came about midway in the tournament Bottomline is that it was all about self-belief         
	Laughing, he thanked Mohinder Jimmy Amarnath (MoM in the semi-final and final of that edition) for summing up things so beautifully the other day.         
	Amarnath had, on Monday, revealed that one of Amjad Gabbar Singh Khans immortal dialogues in Sholay, jo dar gaya so mar gaya, had been his driving force in the final. Call it inspiration, if you like.         
	Yes, that had been our attitude I must thank Jimmy for putting it so beautifully Moreover, you must remember, we didnt have anything to lose that day Kapil said.         
	As it turned out, in a low-scoring final, the West Indies lost by 43 runs. The champagne, however, didnt go waste  some bottles were picked up by Kapils Devils after the customary congratulations/commiserations in the former champions dressing room.         
	For the Indians, the bubbly couldnt ever have tasted better.

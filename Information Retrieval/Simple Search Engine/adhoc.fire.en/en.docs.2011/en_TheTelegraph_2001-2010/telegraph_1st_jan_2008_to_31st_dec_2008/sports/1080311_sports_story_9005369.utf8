	Calcutta: The Calcutta team in the Indian Premier League, Kolkata Knight Riders, will be formally launched in the city on Tuesday.         
	Team owner Shah Rukh Khan will be present along with captain Sourav Ganguly at the launch.         
	Coach John Buchanan has already arrived and also visited the Eden on Monday evening. The team jersey, logo and theme song will be unveiled at the function. Representatives of Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd, the franchisee owned by the actor, were there at the Eden too.         
	However, the CAB is yet to sort out the contentious ticket distribution issue among its affiliates and members. At the special general body meeting, it was decided that president Prasun Mukherjee would speak to Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd in a bid to sort out the impasse.

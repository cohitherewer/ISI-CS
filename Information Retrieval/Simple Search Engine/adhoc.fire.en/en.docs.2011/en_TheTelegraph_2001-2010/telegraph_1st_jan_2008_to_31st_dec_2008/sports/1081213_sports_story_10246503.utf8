The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I like the look of Dhoni, says Brearley
                                                                                                                                                                                                     I like the look of Dhoni, says Brearley
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Chennai: Mike Brearley thinks Mahendra Singh Dhoni has shown the promise to be an exciting captain.         
	I havent seen enough of him but seems like what I have heard all along could be true. In fact, I like the look of Dhoni, his confident approach. He has shown promise, Brearley, one of the most outstanding and respected captains in world cricket, told The Telegraph.         
	In the city for a media assignment, Brearley, however, would prefer to wait for a while before passing a final judgement. The former England captain didnt think it was unconventional for Dhoni to continue with the old ball on the second morning of the Test.         
	I didnt think it was particularly unconventional. The new ball goes off the bat much harder. The Englishmen werent scoring that many runs and the Indians were picking the wickets gradually. I see enough reasoning behind the decision, Brearley said.         
	England were finally dismissed for 316, some 37 minutes after lunch.         
	Theres a tendency in world cricket to make the best player the captain, and it is something that England, too, found hard to resist in the post Michael Vaughan era. This was after a few other experiments failed to bear fruit.         
	The first look of Kevin Pietersen has been striking but Brearley isnt making an assessment in a hurry here either. Pietersen has made a good start but I need to watch people entirely before making a comment. I dont see enough of cricket these days. Its basically restricted to home Tests and weekend matches, he said.         
	Brearley feels that making cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar and Pietersen the captain often mean you run the risk of the losing the batsman.         
	Sachin is always under colossal pressure because of the expectations. To make him captain, as with Pietersen, you run the risk of making him slightly lesser the player.         
	Among current captains, Brearley has been impressed by Graeme Smith. Smith looked pretty good in England recently. He seemed in charge and was confident about his decisions.         
	Stephen Fleming was another good captain. Even Daniel Vettori has been good with his limited resources.         
	Much-impressed with Steve Waugh, Brearley, however, doesnt think too highly of Ricky Ponting. Personally I didnt like him when I saw him in 2005. Hes got much better but I think he is far too defensive Not particularly shrewd, he explained.         
	Even Sourav Ganguly, Indias most successful captain, has failed to enthuse Bearley. I didnt see him very consistently, but he never looked impressive. I thought he was sharing his disappointment or disgruntlement too much on the field.

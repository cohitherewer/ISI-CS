            HENRY WINTER            Paul Scholes celebrates after scoring against Barcelona at Old Trafford on Tuesday. (AFP)                           
	Glory, glory Man United. On a magical night, before an Old Trafford crowd at its raucous best, the champions of England set up a all-English Champions League final through the brilliance of an Englishman, Paul Scholes (briefly reported in Wednesdays Late City edition).         
	How wonderfully appropriate. Scholes missed Uniteds 1999 final appearance through suspension, and there seemed almost nine years of hurt unleashed in his first-half strike that tore into Barcelonas net. Scholes took the plaudits, but Uniteds defence, particularly Rio Ferdinand, Wes Brown and Patrice Evra, excelled as Barcelona had the ball for long periods.         
	Scholess goal also vindicated Sir Alex Fergusons decision to rest him against Chelsea on Saturday. Now United await the winners of the meeting between Chelsea and Liverpool to see whom they face in Moscow on May 21.         
	In a first half full of sound and flair signifying everything to these two great clubs, Scholes had given United so much hope with that magnificent 15th-minute strike, his first goal since August reminding everyone of the thunder that lies in his right boot.         
	These were the situations Scholes adores, a yard of space just outside the box, a glimpse of an unprotected goalkeeper as defenders vainfully sought to man the barricades. The gift of possession had been kindly donated by Barcelona, by Gianluca Zambrotta, a World Cup-winning full-back bizarrely turning into a hung-over Sunday league player. Having gained the ball from Cristiano Ronaldo, the Italian inexplicably hit it blind across his area. Scholes had his chance. That right foot thudded into the ball, sending it flying past Gabriel Milito and then curling away from Victor Valdes in the Barcelona goal. Sensational.         
	 Scholess moment of class settled many nerves. As at the Bridge last Saturday, the announcement of Uniteds line-up had sent beads of sweat spreading across locals foreheads. This time there was no Wayne Rooney, nor Nemanja Vidic, and the absence of the tall defender was particularly felt in the opening minute when Lionel Messi came calling, trailing danger.         
	Having eluded Brown, the Argentine glided towards the box, his regal progress ended by Scholess foul fractionally outside the area. Messis free-kick burrowed into the wall, but the warning was clear. United had to focus for every second of every minute.         
	Although worryingly too lax in possession, United were in determined mood, their spirits buoyed by Scholes goal. Ronaldo then set up the lively Park Ji-sung, whose first-time sidefooter arrowed just wide. Barcelona were rattled, Yaya Toure and Milito arguing, Carles Puyol all long locks and moody looks.         
	United had the lead, but Barcelona had the ball as the half drew to a breathless finish. Uefas statistics claimed that United enjoyed the balls company for 43 per cent of the first half, but they must have included the kick-in. The visitors were utterly dominant, lacking only a predator to turn golden opportunities into goals.         
	Messi was increasingly influential, cutting in from the right, eluding tackle after tackle, causing merry chaos. Still the outstanding Ferdinand and Brown stood firm.         
	The second half swayed between the boxes, United breaking out and going close when Park and Ronaldo combined to release Tevez, whose fearsome drive was saved by Valdes. Back came Barcelona, still putting together their passing moves.         
	Could United hold out? Old Trafford beseeched them to stay strong, to watch Messi, to tame Thierry Henry when the former Arsenal striker arrived to sustained abuse. Henry and Samuel Eto kept switching positions, Henry often hugging the left touchline and then gliding in, echoing his days at Arsenal.         
	Ferguson decided to freshen his team up, introducing Ryan Giggs and Darren Fletcher to stiffen the midfield. But still Barcelona hinted at a breakthrough and only Van der Sars sharp reflexes kept out Henrys header.

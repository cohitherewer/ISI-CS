                                                   Sania, Rohan advance in doubles

           
	Melbourne: Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna won their respective doubles matches on Day 2 of the Australian Open. 
    
	Sania and her Australian partner Alicia Molik, seeded sixth, won a two-hour battle against the unseeded pair of Eleni Daniilidou (Greece) and Jasmin Woehr (Germany) 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 to advance to the second round. 
    
	Bopanna teamed up with American-Indian Rajeev Ram to oust the British-American team of James Auckland and Sam Querrey 6-1, 7-6 (7-4). 
    
	Bopanna and Ram will next play the winners of the match between fifth seeds Leander Paes-Paul Hanley and Luis Horna-Stefan Koubek. 
    
	Sania-Moliks next opponents will be Russians Nadia Petrova and Elena Vesnina, who breezed past local favourites Sophie Ferguson and Trudi Musgrave 6-3, 6-4. 
    
	Sania, who on Monday won her first-round singles encounter, and Molik were tested hard in the engrossing first-round clash. 
    
	The sixth seeds had no trouble in pocketing the opening set in just over half an hour, capitalising on the rivals poor serve and several unforced errors. 
    
	In the second set, though, Sania and Molik were broken twice as Daniilidou and Woehr levelled set scores. 
    
	The deciding set saw an even battle with a number of service breaks. Sania and Molik came out trumps thanks to some superb winners in the end.

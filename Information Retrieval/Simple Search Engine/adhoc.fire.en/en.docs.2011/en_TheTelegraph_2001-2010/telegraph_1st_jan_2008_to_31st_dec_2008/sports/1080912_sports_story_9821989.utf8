The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi praises Somdev
                                                                                                                                                                                           Bhupathi praises Somdev
                      
	New Delhi: Ace tennis star Mahesh Bhupathi Thursday tipped Prakash Amritraj and new kid on the block Somdev Dev Varman as ideal players for Indias upcoming Davis Cup tie in Romania.         
	I feel Prakash and Somdev would be ideal players for the tie to be played on clay court, Bhupathi said on the sidelines of a clinic organised by the Mahesh Bhupathi Team Tennis at Friends Club.         
	The World no. 11 doubles player heaped praise on Somdev and said he is one player who can play in all surfaces.         
	Somdev is an exciting player, he has got amazing college records. He has been successful in all surfaces and will prove to be a key player against Romania, he said.         
	Asked if he was happy with the Davis Cup team, Bhupathi said, We dont have an option really. Ideally, I would have loved to have five players, two for doubles and three for singles so that in case of an injury the fifth player can come good.         
	Bhupathi, who along with Rohan Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj created quite a stir demanding the resignation of Leander Paes as Indias Davis Cup captain, said he never had any personal issues with him but it was more a difference of opinion.

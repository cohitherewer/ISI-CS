The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Souravs soothing words for Dravid
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Souravs soothing words for Dravid
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                           
	Mumbai: By all accounts, Rahul Dravid had no sympathy for Sourav Ganguly during the time Greg Chappell and Kiran More did everything to finish the career of Indias most successful Test captain.         
	Sourav, however, has refused to join those intent on battering Dravid, who is captaining the underperforming and poorly placed Bangalore Royal Challengers in the IPL.         
	People, I think, have been too critical of Rahul... You lose cricket matches and Twenty20 is still new (in India)... Hes got the players to do well, but things just havent worked for Rahul and his team So, lets not be so critical, Sourav told The Telegraph.         
	For the record, Dravids team (owned by an absolutely livid Vijay Mallya) suffered another loss on Saturday.         
	Clearly, even remotely, theres no sign of the good times.

                                                   SA beat WI by 3 wickets
                      
	Kuala Lumpur: Rile Rossouws unbeaten 58 guided South Africa to a three-wicket win over the West Indies in a group B preliminary league match in the under-19 World Cup here on Monday.         
	In other matches, New Zealand defeated Zimbabwe by 98 runs in Johor, Sri Lanka beat Nepal by 61 runs in Penang while Bangladesh spanked Bermuda by 178 runs.         
	Twin half-centuries from Kieran Powell (53) and Devon Thomas (53) had propelled the West Indies to 222 for eight in 50 overs. South Africa had a bad start, losing opener Pieter Malan for a duck as early as the second ball of the innings.         
	Rossouw, however, was rock solid and found an able ally in Roy Adams (unbeaten 26) as the side reached the target with 6.1 overs to spare.         
	Shamarh Brooks was the pick of the West Indian bowlers, claiming four for 39.         
	In group A, Corey Anderson struck 82 and Tim Southee completed a five-wicket haul as New Zealand beat Zimbabwe by 98 runs. In group C, Sri Lanka scored 236 for nine and skittled out Nepal for 175 in 48.5 overs in Penang.

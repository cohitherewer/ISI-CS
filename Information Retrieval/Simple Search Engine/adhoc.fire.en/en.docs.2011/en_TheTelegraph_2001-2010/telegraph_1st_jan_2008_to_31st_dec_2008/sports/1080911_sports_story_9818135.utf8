The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sp. can turn tables on Bagan
                                                                                                                                                                                           Md. Sp. can turn tables on Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans victory over Camellia George Telegraph on Tuesday had sent the green and maroon fans celebrating as their sides name had been all but inscribed on the Sahara CFL Premier Division title.         
	Karim Bencharifas boys had a seemingly unassailable lead with 30 points from 13 games, with a positive goal difference of 13; closest rivals East Bengal were on 24 points from 13 outings as were Mohammedan Sporting, but having played a match less.         
	But on Wednesday, Mohammedan Sporting granted the league a fresh lease of life and showed signs of making a comeback. While pundits were waiting for the Calcutta Port Trust side to snatch points from Mohammedan Sporting, handing Bagan the title in advance, the black and white brigade had other plans as they walloped their opponents and came storming back into the league equation.         
	The closing stages of the league is turning out to be a statisticians delight as the top two teams are likely to be separated on goal difference come Saturday when the league ends. Shabbir Alis men knew they needed to pump in the goals in their remaining two matches to keep Bagan under pressure. And against Port Trust they did exactly that, scoring on four occasions while conceding just once. The result ensures that Mohammedan Sporting have reduced the margin of goal difference between themselves (+10) and Bagan (+13) from a positive six to a positive three, with Bagan still holding the advantage.         
	Mohammedan Sportings 4-1 win against Biswajit Bhattacharjees side also gives Fridays derby between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan mammoth proportions. If third-placed East Bengal win against their archrivals, they will be doing Mohammedan Sporting a huge favour. While even a draw for Bagan will see them clinch the title. Shabbir Alis men are not exactly in the best position, with their fates resting with an indifferent East Bengal side who have dazzled and disappointed in equal measures this season.         
	But if East Bengal do manage to pull off a victory against Bagan, who are still struggling with injuries and suspensions, Shabbir Alis season long accusations of IFAs step-motherly attitude towards his side might change for once. According to the fixtures, his side will then be taking the pitch against United SC on Saturday knowing exactly the number of goals they need to score to pip Bagan to the title on goal difference.         
	Speaking after Wednesdays match, Shabbir said, Anything can happen in footballuntil someone actually lifts the title, no one can be sure about becoming champions. He added, The boys played very well today, they knew what was needed and they managed to do so. Both Shabbir and Biswajit Bhattacharjee vehemently brushed aside any questions about CPT losing such a crunch match a tad too easily.         
	Biswajit said, My team made a few mistakes today, silly defensive errors, but there can be no questions about our commitment.         
	The sheen, which had gone away from Fridays derby after Bagans triumph over George Telegraph, has now been restored. The spotlight will be on East Bengal who may just choose to play king-maker on Friday.

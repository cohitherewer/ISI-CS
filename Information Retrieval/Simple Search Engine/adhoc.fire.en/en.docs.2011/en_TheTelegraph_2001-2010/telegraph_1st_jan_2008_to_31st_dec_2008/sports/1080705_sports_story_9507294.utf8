                                                                                                                                                                                                     He has to prove fitness: Ahmed 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Karachi: Pakistans chief selector, Salahuddin Ahmed, didnt go overboard on hearing that the temperamental Shoaib Akhtar could play following the suspension of his 18-month ban.         
	Look, the Pakistan Cricket Board will first have to advise us on the issue of picking Shoaib... Then, hell have to play domestic cricket before he can be considered for the national squad... Hell have to prove his match-fitness, Ahmed told The Telegraph.         
	Indications are that Pakistan will feature in a Twenty20 competition in Toronto next month. If that doesnt materialise, then there will be a break till the Champions Trophy in September.         
	Enough time for Shoaib to get fit.

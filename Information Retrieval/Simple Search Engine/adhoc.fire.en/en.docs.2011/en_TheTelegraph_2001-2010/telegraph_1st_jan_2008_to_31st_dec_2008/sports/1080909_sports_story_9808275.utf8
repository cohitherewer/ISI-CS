            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh and Ishant Sharma      
	New Delhi: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni leads Indias charge in the prestigious LG-ICC awards for 2008 to be announced in Dubai on Wednesday.         
	According to the list of nominations declared here on Monday by ICC chief executive officer Haroon Lorgart, the Indian wicketkeeper-batsman has been nominated in two categories  the ODI player of the year and the Twenty20 international performance of the year.         
	The second nomination is for leading India to the Twenty20 World Cup title last year.         
	Dhoni is one of the four Indian players who have been nominated for the ICC awards, considered the highest honours in the cricketing world.         
	While ace batsman Sachin Tendulkar features among the four nominees for the ODI Player of the Year award, Delhi paceman Ishant Sharma (Emerging Player of the Year) and hard-hitting batsman Yuvraj Singh (T20 Performance of the Year) are the other Indian nominees in the list.         
	Yuvraj, the ICC chief executive said, has found his place in the list mainly because of his incredible six sixes in one over against England in the Twenty20 World Cup.         
	Ishant faces tough competition in the Emerging Player category with Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis, England fast bowler Stuart Broad and South African fast bowler Morne Morkel also in contention.         
	The West Indies Chris Gayle and Australia s Brett Lee are the competitors to Dhoni and Yuvraj in the T20 Performance of the Year category. The Indian ODI captain and Tendulkar are pitted against Nathan Bracken and Mohammed Yousuf in the ODI Player of the Year section.         
	These awards are equivalent to Oscars in films, said Lorgart. Our five-member panel, headed by Clive Lloyd, has done a wonderful job.         
	The other members of the selection panel are: Greg Chappell (Australia), Shaun Pollock, Sidath Wettymuni (Sri Lanka) Atahar Ali Khan (Bangladesh).         
	No Indian, however, has been nominated for the Cricketer of the Year and the Test Player of the Year awards with Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Mahela Jayawardene and Dale Steyn finding a place in both categories.         
	The other nominee for the Cricketer of the Year award is South Africa captain Graeme Smith while his teammate Jacques Kallis is a nominee in the Test category.         
	None of the nominees in the Cricketer of the Year category has won the award previously.         
	Rahul Dravid (2004), Andrew Flintoff and Jacques Kallis (Joint winners in 2005) and Australian captain Ricky Ponting (consecutive winner in 2006 and 2007) are the previous winners of the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy.

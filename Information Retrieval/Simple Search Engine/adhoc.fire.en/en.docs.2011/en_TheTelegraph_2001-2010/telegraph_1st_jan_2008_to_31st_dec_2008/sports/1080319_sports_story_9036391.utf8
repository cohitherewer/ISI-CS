    - REMEMBERING BOB A YEAR AFTER HIS MYSTERIOUS DEATH                 Bob Woolmer                           
	Karachi: Twelve months after the death of Bob Woolmer, former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq admitted that he would never forget the inspirational cricket coach.         
	Pakistan cricket will always be indebted to Bob Woolmer for his contribution to the game, Inzamam said on the first anniversary of the former England Test batsmans death. I want to forget the tragedies of the World Cup, but I can never forget Bob. He was not only an excellent coach, but also a very good human being.         
	Woolmer, 58, who had also coached South Africa, was found dead in his hotel room in Jamaica on March 18, 2007, just a day after Pakistan had been sensationally knocked out of the World Cup following a shock defeat to Ireland.         
	The tragedy was initially treated as murder with some commentators insisting that Woolmer was killed to prevent him blowing the whistle on illegal betting, the curse of the game in Asia.         
	However, after the biggest manhunt in Jamaican history and following months of wild speculation, an inquest jury in October eventually returned an open verdict on Woolmers death.         
	Inzamam was so shattered by the events that he quit one-day cricket in tears immediately after Pakistans last game in the doomed Caribbean campaign.         
	He was helpful to all and very accommodating. He always thought about the team and saw to it that we kept improving, added Inzamam, who also quit Test cricket in October last year.         
	After the defeat to Ireland, we were all depressed but Bob was trying to console everyone and was trying to convince us that it was just a bad day and things would improve for the team.         
	He asked me what were my plans. I told him that my mind was not working and we would talk the following day, but that opportunity never came and we got the shocking news of his death.         
	Woolmer had himself ruled out any hasty decision over his own future with the team.         
	Im deeply hurt and I dont know how this is going to affect me, but I will let you know, Woolmer, in an interview after the match, had said.         
	When his death was initially treated as murder, the Pakistan players were finger-printed and DNA-tested before Jamaican police finally announced in June that Woolmer, who suffered from diabetes, had died of natural causes.         
	Former international leg-spinner, and bowling coach, Mushtaq Ahmed said Woolmer was an inspiration for all those he coached.         
	Bob was successful at county level where he coached Warwickshire, then lifted South Africa and was hoping to build Pakistan into a great team before he met a cruel fate, said Mushtaq.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) dedicated their indoor cricket school to their late coach, which was inaugurated by both the Pakistan and South African teams.         
	Bob will be remembered in Pakistan cricket and hopefully his legacy will continue. His memory is still fresh because his contribution to Pakistan cricket was immense, said PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | From boys to men, the Karim Bencharifa way 
                                                                                                                                                                                                         From boys to men, the Karim Bencharifa way 
          RWITAYAN MUKHERJEE      Calcutta Football League Premier Division             Mohun Bagans (from left) Rino Anto, S. Malswamtluanga, Jose Ramirez Barreto, S. James Singh and P. C. Lalawmpuiya                                 
	Calcutta: While the Sahara CFL Premier Division was on, several super-size billboards promoting the league dotted the cityscape. They were part of the leagues broadcast partners promotion plans. Survival at stake screamed the headline accompanying an artwork of two battalions facing each other, dressed in green-and-maroon and red-and-gold respectively. Reminiscent of frames from Frank Millers 300. And the two-month long league turned out to be exactly that  a gruelling battle of attrition.         
	A race that went down to the wire and had everything from bites, slaps, scuffles, allegations, counter-allegations, scheduling and rescheduling. Thankfully it all ended on Saturday, and the only casualty so far has been Manoranjan Bhattacharjee.         
	For the record, Mohun Bagan clinched their 28th title, but not before being chased hard by Mohammedan Sporting  this seasons jack-in-the-box. Eventually a point separated the two sides (this by the way was the 24th time that the league has been decided by that margin).         
	Expectations were greater from East Bengal, but they were mostly below par. Camellia George Telegraph, under maidan-veteran Raghu Nandy, won hearts with their free-flowing football.         
	Calcutta Port Trust and United SC, placed mid-table, often took points off the Big Three. United SC, under Subrata Bhattacharjee, have shown enough signs that will make teams in the I-League sit up and take notice. At the bottom, Peerless FC were woeful failing to manage a single win, while Railway FC did marginally better winning once against guess who? Peerless of course!         
	Mohun Bagan, under new coach Karim Bencharifa, got off to a flier thanks to hattricks from Jose Ramirez Barreto and S.Malswamtluanga against United SC and Railway FC, respectively. But so did Mohammedan Sporting, staying at par with Bagan on the points tally. The difference between the two sides was perhaps in the levels of consistency, for one look at the league table tells us that Shabbir Alis side lost one extra game, which eventually cost them the title.         
	Mohun Bagan did what marathon league winners have successfully done over the years  they ground out the results even when they werent playing very well. Karim Bencharifa brought in an air of professionalism, a steely resolve in his young squad.         
	When the strikers werent firing, others stepped up. Habibur Rehman Mondal, the teams right back, for example got two scrappy, but important goals. Or the inexperienced back four playing together as a unit for the first time on the crucial derby day, and holding fort well.         
	A foreign coach making a squad largely made up of home-grown players into a unit who fight, run hard till the 90th minute, report to practice on time and eventually deliver  Karims story is not very different from Bob Houghtons.         
	Houghton, far away from the bustle of the action in Calcutta, affected proceedings in a major way in the league. At least for East Bengal coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee, Houghton has been the puppeteer, operating from the shadows and keeping most of the national team players away from East Bengal for a considerable period of time.         
	By the time they returned East Bengal were already out of the running, after a slow and indifferent start. Speaking after the derby draw against Bagan, Manoranjan summed up his efforts saying: I didnt get the whole team when we needed to get off to a good start, and also when we did have players, most were injured.         
	If the billboards predicted a battle as momentous as that of Thermopylae then Shabbir Ali surely fills the Spartan sandals of Leonidas. With a largesse not as big as the traditional Big Two, the astute tactician did brilliantly with his available resources. True he had one Theodore Sunday in the ranks, and the love and support of thousands of Mohammedan Sporting fans.         
	Many would say, Mohammedan Sporting deserved to win the league after 81, but Habibur Rehmans late, late goal nipped claims of poetic justice in the bud.         
	Before the I-League gets underway in two weeks time and the Calcutta Port Trusts and Railway FCs are conveniently forgotten, one last mention must be made of the young guns who made this edition of the league memorable. George Telegraphs Suvo Kumar, Beokhokhei and Pradip Roy, Railway FCs under-19 winger Munna Mullick, United SCs Malswama Hamar and Gouranga Dutta and several others  thank you all for making many a dull afternoon, memorable if only for a minute or so.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib dream receding
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shoaib dream receding

	Karachi: Controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtars chances of playing in the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) seemed to be receding with the tribunal to hear his appeal against five-year ban not likely to decide on the matter soon.         
	Given the busy schedule of the chairman of the appellate tribunal Aftab Farrukh, retired judge of the Lahore high court and now a practising barrister, it is unlikely that the case will be decided in a hurry.         
	The IPL starts on April 18 and organisers have said Shoaib, who was to play for Kolkata Knight Riders, would not be eligible to play in the Twenty20 tourney until the Pakistan board removes the ban. I dont think we are going to have a situation where the appellate tribunal will reach a decision after one or two sittings... The chairman and Salman Taseer could drag the hearing beyond a month, a PCB official said.         
	The tribunal, which had former Test player Haseeb Ahsan and former federal minister Salman Taseer as other members, was set up last week.         
	Meanwhile, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf, disciplinary committee chairman Muneer Hafeez and Shoaib will appear before the senate standing committee on sports and culture on Monday for a hearing called to look into cricket matters and the events leading up to the ban imposed on Shoaib.

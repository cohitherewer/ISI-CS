            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Lack of a good fifth bowler in the team cost Delhi DareDevils the match against Chennai Super Kings on Friday, said Virender Sehwag.         
	In the last over, when the Chennai side needed 15 runs to win, Sehwag thought of taking up the responsibility but then decided in favour of Shoaib Malik after consulting teammates.         
	Our fast bowlers had bowled well. So it was between Shoaib and me, said Sehwag. I knew all along that the fifth bowler could have gone for runs at any stage of the match.         
	Unfortunately, it happened in the last over. I expected about 40 runs off the fifth bowler but Malik and I went for 58. That made the difference in the end, added Sehwag.         
	South African Albei Morkel, who hit Sehwag for three sixes in the 14th over, described his innings as really satisfying. I would have targeted any bowler. It was just that it was Sehwag, he said.         
	In Twenty20, when you need 15 runs in the final over, you always have a chance. Gony had done well in the last match by hitting two big sixes off the final over. So, off the first two balls he had to take a chance, Morkel said.

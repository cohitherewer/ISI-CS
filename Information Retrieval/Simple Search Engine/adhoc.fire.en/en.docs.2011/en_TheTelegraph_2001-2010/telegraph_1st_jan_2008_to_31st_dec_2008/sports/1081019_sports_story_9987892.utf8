	Madrid: Frances Gilles Simon knocked world No. 1 Rafael Nadal out of the Madrid Masters on Saturday after a thrilling 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 tussle to set up a final clash against Britains Andy Murray, who outgunned world No. 2 Roger Federer 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 in the other semi-final.         
	Simon took almost three-and-a-half hours, saving 17 break points along the way, to record his first victory in three meetings against the Spaniard.         
	Although Nadal won the first set comfortably, the French world No. 16 refused get overawed by the Mallorcans brutish groundstrokes. The two slugged it out in one high-class rally after another and the Frenchman eventually prevailed to level the contest.         
	Murray, the world No. 4, showed flashes of form early on but Federer gave the 21-year-old no time to settle, forcing him into unforced errors to break midway through the first set.         
	The Scot slammed 14 aces, 10 in the final set, but Federer saved six break points before finally cracking at 5-5 when he struck a forehand long.         
	Murray brought up match point with a huge cross-court forehand and sealed his third victory over Federer when his opponent netted a forehand.         
	 On Friday, fourth seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles continued their quest for a Masters Cup berth after knocking out sixth seeds Simon Aspelin and Julian Knowle 6-3, 7-5 in 76 minutes in doubles action.         
	In the semi-finals, the Indo-Bahamian pair will meet Jonas Bjorkman and Kevin Ullyett, who ousted top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan 6-4, 6-4.

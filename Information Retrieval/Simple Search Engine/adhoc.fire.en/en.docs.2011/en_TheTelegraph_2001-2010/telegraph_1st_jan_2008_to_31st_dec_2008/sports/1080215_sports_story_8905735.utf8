The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | U-19 World Cup helped me mature, says Smith
                                                     U-19 World Cup helped me mature, says Smith
            A STAFF REPORTER                        Sanath Jayasuriya, Graeme Smith and Alastair Cook                           
	Calcutta: South Africa captain Graeme Smith, in Kuala Lumpur for media-related commitments ahead of the ICC Under-19 World Cup, said that playing in an international event so early on in his career had helped him mature as a cricketer.         
	Speaking to ICC host broadcaster ESPN-STAR Sports ahead of this years event, which begins in Malaysia on Sunday, Smith said: Representing your country is always a special honour and I still vividly remember my experiences of playing at the Under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2000.         
	It taught me the importance of dealing with the challenges that international cricket, particularly in a tournament environment, will throw at you. The challenge of taking on different teams in different conditions was an invaluable lesson.         
	I believe the experiences of preparing for an international tournament was an important stepping stone for me, more so as it was the first time I had played in a global event against the worlds strongest teams, said Smith.         
	Smiths sentiments were echoed by vastly experienced Sri Lanka allrounder Sanath Jayasuriya, who played in the first Under-19 World Cup in 1988.         
	Brian Lara captained the West Indies, Michael Atherton captained England, Inzamam-ul Haq was the captain of Pakistan. From that tournament I realised one has to work hard to be selected in the Sri Lanka team and to stay in the team.         
	I saw a lot of players come in and then be dropped and I did not want to do that. I wanted to keep performing, said Jayasuriya.         
	This is a great tournament. This is how you get exposure to play at international level. I got the exposure and came up with a good performance. It helps you to establish yourself as an international player, he said.         
	England opening batsman Alastair Cook got his international career off to a great start at the 2004 edition in Bangladesh. In seven innings, the left-hander scored 383 runs at an average of 76.60 including a top score of 108 not out.         
	What I remember most is the experience of staying together as a group of young lads trying to win a tournament, trying to progress through and trying to do our best.         
	It was a tough tour playing under the conditions that we had. I have fond memories and it helped my cricket a long way, said Cook.         
	Having been in their shoes, Smith has plenty of advice for this years crop of talent from around the globe.         
	Use it to learn. Whether its attending your first-ever press conference, giving your first post-match television interview, signing bats, attending education sessions delivered by the ICC, or watching how other teams prepare for matches, all these elements are things that you will do time and time again as a senior player. The sooner you learn how to conduct yourself properly. the easier it will be when you are playing international cricket, he said.         
	There will be a global audience watching on television and it is a great opportunity to put your name on the lips of the international cricket community, in the same way the likes of Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif did when they helped India win the competition back in 2000.

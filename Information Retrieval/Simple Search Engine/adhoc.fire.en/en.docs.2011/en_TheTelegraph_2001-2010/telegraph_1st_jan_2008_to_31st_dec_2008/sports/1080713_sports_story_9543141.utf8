            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly will try out his soccer skills for United SC in the ongoing Sahara Calcutta Football League Premier Division.         
	Sourav, who will leave the city on Sunday to join the Test squad in Chennai, will sign after returning from Sri Lanka, according to a club official.         
	He (Sourav) will sign for the whole season. Actually this is a move to promote the game... He (Sourav) is the brand ambassador of our sponsor (Chirag) and hence the move, a club official said.         
	It was learnt that Sourav would play only one match in the local league. If everything goes according to plan, he will play against East Bengal on August 24.         
	According to the official, his turning out for United SC in the I-League will depend on his availability.         
	Sourav, who had a rigorous training session for more than an hour at the Eden on Saturday, sounded confident about his performance in the Sri Lanka series starting from July 23.         
	I have played some good innings there (Sri Lanka). This time, too, I am hopeful of some good knocks, he said.

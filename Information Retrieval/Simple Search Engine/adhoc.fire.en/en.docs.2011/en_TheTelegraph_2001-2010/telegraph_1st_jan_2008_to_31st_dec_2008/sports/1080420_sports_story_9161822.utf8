	 Modi rsquo;s views  New Delhi: Refuting allegations that the BCCI acts like a bully towards other boards, vice-president Lalit Modi said the rest of the cricketing world make money only when they play against India. ldquo;Look, no one was concerned about cricket in India for the past 100 years, rdquo; Modi told a TV channel. ldquo;Now the situation is such that most of the boards earn only when their team plays against India. Earlier they used to earn when they played against Australia. If the various boards earn money by playing against India, then we too have to put across our viewpoints firmly rdquo; he added.

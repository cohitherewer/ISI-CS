The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delhi take command
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Delhi take command
                      
	New Delhi: Unbeaten half centuries by Aakash Chopra and Virat Kohli put Delhi in command against Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited on the second day of the Mohammad Nissar Trophy cricket match at Ferozeshah Kotla here.         
	Chopra smashed 93 and Kohli hit 91, to propel the hosts to 242 for one in their second essay and grabbed a 110-run lead with nine wickets in hand after restricting the Pakistani side to 266 all out half way through the four-day match.         
	The duo stitched a patient 196-run partnership off 332 balls.         
	Earlier, captain Virender Sehwag cracked a blitzkrieg 37 off 29 balls, providing the only entertaining part of day two.         
	He punished the Quaid-e-Azam champion bowlers, who fully exploited the overcast conditions on the opening day, by making them run all around the park during his almost half-an- hour stay at the crease.         
	The opener, who was removed by Imran Ali for a duck in the first innings, took the revenge by clobbering 15 runs, including three boundaries, in the pacemans third over.

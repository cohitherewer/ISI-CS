  - Sehwag carries bat through to 201; Six-wicket haul for Mendis             Virender Sehwag en route to his unbeaten 201 on Day II of the second Test in Galle on Friday. (AP)                           
	Galle: Virender Sehwag stood bravely amid the ruins with a swashbuckling unbeaten 201 before Harbhajan Singh scalped four wickets to leave the second cricket Test between India and Sri Lanka evenly poised at the end of the second day here on Friday.         
	The dashing Sehwag again did the bulk of the scoring as the Indians folded up for 329 in their first innings with mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis tormenting them with a six-wicket haul.         
	The hosts then lost opener Michael Vandort in the very first over but recovered to some extent through a 133-run second wicket partnership between Malinda Warnapura (66) and Kumar Sangakkara (68) even though they still trail India by 114 runs. But Harbhajan (four for 71) then broke the Lankan backbone to leave the hosts at 215 for five at close on an absorbing second days play.         
	Captain Mahela Jayawardene (46) and Prasana Jayawardene (5) were at the crease at stumps on a day that saw as many as 11 wickets tumble at the Galle International Stadium.         
	Resuming at the overnight score of 214 for four, the Indian innings came to an end just at the stroke of lunch with Sehwag carrying his bat through for his unbeaten 201 which contained 22 boundaries and four sixes. Sehwag and the stylish V.V.S. Laxman (39), the two overnight batsmen, showed signs of consolidating the innings but Mendis provided the breakthrough for the hosts by evicting Laxman.         
	None of the other batsmen could hang around for long as the remaining five wickets fell for the addition of just 51 runs.         
	Mendis, whose mesmerising variations and guile have troubled the Indians, was the pick of the Sri Lankan bowlers as he recorded his maiden five-wicket haul, finishing with impressive figures of six for 117.         
	The Indians, who desperately need to win the match to keep themselves afloat in the three-match series, will now have to stop the islanders from piling up a mammoth first innings total to remain in the game. With three full days remaining in the crucial Test, the home team have a slight advantage at this stage.         
	The Sri Lankan innings began on a disastrous note with paceman Zaheer Khan firing the first salvo by getting rid of Vandort (4) in his very first over. The tall left-hander got a thick outside edge off Khan that was well taken by Rahul Dravid at the third slip.         
	But Sangakkara and Warnapura then got into a one-day mould, scoring at more than one run a minute during the first hour after lunch, hitting Zaheer and Ishant Sharma to all corners of the ground.         
	Harbhajan could have had Sangakkara but for a miss by Dinesh Karthik who could not collect the ball to stump him.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Grant the clever one as Sir Alex smarts
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Grant the clever one as Sir Alex smarts
            PATRICK BARCLAY            Avram Grant                           
	If Avram Grant is as poor a manager as his flock of critics would have you believe, how convincingly would Chelsea have regained their title from Manchester United this season  tied it all up by Easter, surely  with a good one?         
	The lugubrious Israeli must have something. Since succeeding Jose Mourinho in September, he has supervised only two Premier League defeats  at Old Trafford in his first match and then the Emirates Stadium  and, in the last month alone, made substitutions that contributed to victories at Stamford Bridge over Arsenal and now United.         
	On the Champions League front, he has taken Chelsea as far as Mourinho did: to the semi-finals. Their chances, moreover, are all the better in Wednesdays second leg against Liverpool for an own-goal which John Arne Riise scored under pressure from Nicolas Anelka, whom Grant had just sent on at Anfield. Yet still Grant is portrayed as inadequate.         
	Wherever the critics obtain their information, it is beginning to look about as reliable as an Iraq war dossier. Of course it is true, as in Tony Blairs time, that a lot can happen in 45 minutes, and the second half of this match was certainly a case in point. What drama. Even Grant would have escaped blame had Chelsea handed Wayne Rooney the title on a plate as everyone could see it was Ricardo Carvalho who had erred.         
	Michale Ballack is one of those who have prospered since Mourinho gave way to Grant and in this match, for the most tragic of reasons, Germanys captain smoothly reverted to the central attacking role in midfield; Frank Lampard would have been expected to occupy it but for his mothers death on Thursday. Before discussing any other aspect of the victory, Grant referred to Lampard, saying simply: Its for him.         
	At Everton nine days earlier, Grant had been sparing with the press and been criticised. Here Sir Alex Ferguson, as usual, declined to face the spinners, subjecting himself only to MUTVs military-medium, and it was a particularly good inquisition to miss because surely one of us would have had the temerity to mention that the United manager had performed major surgery on his team with their own Champions League return  against Barcelona at Old Trafford on Tuesday  in mind.         
	It is all too easy, however, to ascribe the result to his changes. Not only were they reasonable on the grounds that Ferguson had to keep his players, Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Scholes included, as fresh as possible for Barcelona  they did, after all, fatally run out of impetus at this stage of last seasons campaign and lost to Milan  and that the purpose of having a squad is to use it in precisely these circumstances, when three immensely important matches must be faced in the space of less than a week.         
	He picked an astute team in Barcelona. This went wrong. But you could put Ballacks first goal more down to the unfortunate loss of Nemanja Vidic than Fergusons tinkering.At what Ferguson has so memorably christened squeaky-bum time, Grants condition was impressive. Ferguson ranted about the ludicrously perceived injustice of the penalty award: If it goes down to decisions like that, were in trouble. But he could tell his MUTV audience: Its still in our hands. The pressure bears down. By this time next week, Fergusons United could be on the threshold of a glorious double or victims of apparent implosion. Grants Chelsea could be high-riding or history. What a game!           THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

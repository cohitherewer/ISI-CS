                                                   Sania falls in quarters

           
	Hobart: Sania Mirza crashed out of the $1,70,000 Moorilla Hobart International after losing to Italian Flavia Pennetta in the quarter finals on Wednesday. The sixth seeded Indian went down 5-7, 6-1, 3-6. 
    
	Sania wasted seven of 12 break points against the Italian, who later admitted that her job was made easier by the Indians poor form. 
    
	Second seed Vera Zvonareva advanced to the semi-finals with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Russian compatriot Elena Vesnina. 
    
	Though the match was scrappy, the Italian converted more of her opportunities. She won five of her eight break points. It was not a very good match for people to watch, Pennetta said. There were a lot of mistakes from both players. 
    
	Ashley Harkleroad of the US booked a place in the semis against Zvonareva with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over fellow qualifier Edina Gallovits of Romania. 
    
	Greeces Eleni Daniilidou completed the semi-final line-up with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Australias Casey Dellacqua and she will now face Pennetta.

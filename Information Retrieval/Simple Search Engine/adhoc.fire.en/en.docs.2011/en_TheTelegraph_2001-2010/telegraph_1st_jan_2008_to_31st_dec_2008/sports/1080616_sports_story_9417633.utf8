The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A first for Rafael Nadal
                                                                                                                                                                                                     A first for Rafael Nadal
                      
	 London: Rafael Nadal rubber-stamped his grass court credentials by winning his first Queens Club trophy with a 7-6, 7-5 victory over Serbias Novak Djokovic on Sunday.         
	The top seed became the first Spanish man to win a title on green turf since Andres Gimeno walked away with the Eastbourne trophy in 1972.         
	With just over a week to go before the Wimbledon starts on June 23, the achievement will supply Nadal with the much needed boost as he aims to improve on his two runner-up finishes at the All England Club in 2006 and 2007.         
	After recovering from a terrible start, when he trailed 0-3 in the opening set, Nadal rebounded in a striking style and wrapped up victory with a thumping smash.         
	It was the French Open champions third win in the last three tournaments over the second-seeded Djokovic, following semi-final victories in Hamburg and at Roland Garros. This week was amazing for me, Nadal said.         
	The win should also furnish Nadal immense confidence ahead of Wimbledon, particularly after his resounding straight-sets win over World No. 1 Roger Federer in the French Open final.         
	Federer has won the last five Wimbledon crowns, beating Nadal in the last two finals, but also lost to Djokovic in this years Australian Open semi-finals.         
	Djokovic said he was still happy with his performance  especially since he only started playing on grass three years ago.         
	Well, I tried. It was a great match, he said.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussie media wary of Kumble
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aussie media wary of Kumble
                      
	Sydney: The Australian media on Thursday said Indian skipper Anil Kumbles performance would have a strong bearing on the outcome on the four-match Test series between the two countries, beginning with the first Test in Bangalore on October 9.         
	The leg-spinning Kumble is an astute, humble and skilful cricketer who will have a major role to play in the India vs Australia series, an Australian daily said in its report.         
	Kumble, who will turn 38 next month, is under increasing pressure from ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis supporters to step down and hand over the reins to the dynamic wicket-keeper but the report highlighted Dhonis batting failure in Australia last summer while crediting the leg-spinners feat.         
	Dhoni can also be a batting hurricane but he failed to flatten Australia last summer, scoring just 141 runs at 17.62 while Kumble, the third-highest wicket-taker in Test history, responded with 20 scalps in an epic series.         
	Dhoni has impressed some officials with his deeds in the Twenty20 and the 50-over game, but others are wary of over-burdening a man who had to sit out the entire mid-year Test series against Sri Lanka because of fatigue, the report read.         
	Dhoni, though, has played down the suggestions, saying it makes no sense.         
	Ive never given too much thought to these things. Theres no point. Im just happy to be playing the game, playing for the country and enjoying every moment, he said on Wednesday.

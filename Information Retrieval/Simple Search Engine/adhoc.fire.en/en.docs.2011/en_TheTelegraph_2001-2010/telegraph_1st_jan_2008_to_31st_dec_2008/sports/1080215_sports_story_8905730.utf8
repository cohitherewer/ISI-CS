The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fleming to quit Tests after England series
                                                     Fleming to quit Tests after England series
                  Stephen Fleming                     
	Wellington: Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming is retiring from international cricket at the end of next months home Test series against England, he told a news conference in Auckland Thursday.         
	The 34-year-old quit one-day Internationals after last years World Cup and is now giving up Tests to focus on his family and business interests.         
	I always indicated that I was likely to retire from international cricket at some point in the near future and the time is right for me and my family to do that now, he said.         
	Fleming is New Zealands most capped player and leading run scorer in both Tests and one-day cricket.         
	A stylish left-hander and excellent slips fieldsman, Fleming has played a record 108 Tests since making his debut in 1994. He became New Zealands youngest Test captain when he was appointed skipper at 23. He skippered his country on 80 occasions, winning 28 times before losing the captaincy to his close friend Daniel Vettori last year.         
	He scored 6,785 runs at an average of 39.73 and a highest score of 274 not out, against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2003, unselfishly declaring in sight of a triple-century.         
	For all his success, Fleming was often criticised for his failure to convert good starts into bigger scores, registering 43 half-centuries but only nine hundreds.         
	Fleming also played 280 one-day Internationals, compiling 8,037 runs and a high score of an unbeaten 134 against South Africa at the 2003 World Cup in arguably his finest performance.         
	He also led the Black Caps to victory in the 2000 Champions Trophy in Kenya and to the World Cup semi-finals in 1999 and 2007.         
	I probably got more joy out of my captaincy than my batting, he added. Id like to be remembered as someone who got the best out of a team that was perhaps challenged at times because of resources but still managed to punch above their weight.         
	New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan paid tribute to Flemings achievements and said he hoped he would continue his involvement in the sport.         
	Stephens presence and leadership qualities had a tremendous impact on the team. He has made a huge contribution, Vaughan said.         
	Fleming said he planned to start up a new career but, like many international players who have recently retired, also intends to play in the lucrative Twenty20 Indian Premier League (IPL) starting this year.

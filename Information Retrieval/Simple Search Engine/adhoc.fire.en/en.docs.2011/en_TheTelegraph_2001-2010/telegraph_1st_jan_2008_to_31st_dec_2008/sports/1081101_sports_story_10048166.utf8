	 On 54, Australia registered their best opening partnership in Delhi. The previous best was 53 by C MsDonald and L Favell in 1959-60.         
	 Matthew Hayden (83) and Simon Katich, who opened for the first time together in the opening Test of this series in Bangalore, recorded their first hundred partnership for the first wicket.         
	 Hayden has now been involved in 21 century stands for the first wicket. His favourite partner being Justin Langer with whom he shared 14 century stands. Hayden has also been involved in six century opening stands against India.         
	 The 123-run partnership for the first wicket is now Australias second best for the opening wicket on Indian soil. The best remains 136 by Langer and Hayden in Chennai, 2004-05.         
	 Hayden now has 1779 runs against India. He is now the fifth highest run-scorer against India in Tests. Clive Lloyd (2344), Javed Miandad (2228), Sir Viv Richards (1927), and Gary Sobers (1920) are the others who have more runs than Hayden.         
	 Hayden scored his seventh Test fifty against India. He now moves to joint second position in the list of Australians with most fifties against India. Alan Border (9) heads the list while Bill Lawry, Doug Walters and Hayden have seven each.         
	 Hayden also hit the 81st six of his career. He moves past Flintoff (80 sixes) and is fifth in the list of batsmen with most sixes. Adam Gilchrist with 100 sixes heads this list.         
	 Ponting (4512 runs), when on 75, completed 4500 runs as captain. He becomes the sixth captain to do so. For the record, Border with 6623 has the most runs as captain. Ponting also became the sixth Australian captain to score 500 or more runs as captain against India. Bob Simpson, Border, Steve Waugh, Sir Don Bradman and Kim Hughes are the others to do so.

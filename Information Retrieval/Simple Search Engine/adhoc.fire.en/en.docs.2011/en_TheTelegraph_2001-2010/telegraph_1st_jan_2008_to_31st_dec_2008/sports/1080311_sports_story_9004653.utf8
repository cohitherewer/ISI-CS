	Chennai: Former Team India coach Greg Chappell on Monday refrained from commenting on Indias one-day series win in Australia but harped on the talent available in the country.         
	I did not see a great deal of the action in Australia. I would focus on the job on hand. I am here for a specific work. No comments.         
	Chappell emphasised the need to shift from the old practices in Indian cricket. Some of the ideas like the young players using heavy bats need to be addressed at some stage, he said.         
	He also did not comment on the IPL and ICL. It all comes down to the development programme, he said. Modern cricket is very demanding. If we prepare them with the right mixture, especially at a young age, they will be able to carry out the work load, particularly the fast bowlers.

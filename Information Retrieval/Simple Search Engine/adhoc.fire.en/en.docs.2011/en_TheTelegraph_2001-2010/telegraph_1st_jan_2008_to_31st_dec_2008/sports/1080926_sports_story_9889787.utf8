The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chappell to help out Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chappell to help out Ponting
                              
	Jaipur: Greg Chappells role in the Australian teams scheme of things seems to be getting even bigger than expected as the former India coach has apparently been given the job to address captain Ricky Pontings dismal record in India during the Test series starting October 9.         
	Ponting has scored just 172 runs from 14 innings in India at an average of 12.28 as compared to his overall Test average of 58.37 and Guru Greg was on Thursday seen devoting much of his time on the visiting captain during the three-hour team practice session at RCAs Future Cricket Academy.         
	He arrived at the Academy with the first lot of players comprising only batsmen, wearing his trademark round hat and scarf around the neck. Head coach Tim Nielsen reached later with the second lot of players comprising bowlers and allrounders.         
	Chappell watched Ponting play his natural shots off fast bowlers, locals and Rajasthan Ranji players  on a specially-designed conventional fifth-day India pitch at the RCA facility for around 20 minutes without giving much attention to other batsmen.         
	He then had a lengthy animated discussion with Ponting after the captain switched to the spinning wicket, apparently telling him how to adjust his techniques while facing an Anil Kumble or Harbhajan Singh on slow Indian pitches.         
	What actually transpired was out of bounds for the scribes as they had to watch the players from a distance.         
	The former Australia captain, now the assistant coach of the team, in his capacity as head of Cricket Australias Centre of Excellence in Brisbane has also decided to end his hide-and-seek with the media with a formal interaction on Saturday.         
	Australias media manager Matthew Slade confirmed Chappell would express his views on various issues on Saturday at a press conference.         
	Opener Matthew Hayden and vice-captain Michael Clarke also got attention from Chappell, who had discussions with the two batsmen while slogging at the spinning tracks.

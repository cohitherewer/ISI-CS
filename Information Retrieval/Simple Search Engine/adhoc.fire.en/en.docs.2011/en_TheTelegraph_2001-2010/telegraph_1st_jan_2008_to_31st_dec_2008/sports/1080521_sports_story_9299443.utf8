The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj amp; Co. up against resurgent Mumbai
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yuvraj amp; Co. up against resurgent Mumbai
                  Sanath Jayasuriya                     
	Mumbai: Mumbai Indians, on a roll with six successive wins under their belt and thirsting for revenge for their previous loss, take on second-placed Kings XI Punjab in an engrossing Indian Premier League (IPL) tussle in hot and humid conditions at the Wankhede Stadium here on Wednesday.         
	The visiting team, depending on homegrown bowling talent for the most part after the departure of Australian pace ace Brett Lee, would be up against the likes of the wily Shaun Pollock and South African compatriot Andre Nel, the temperamental pacer with the ability to extract good bounce.         
	Kings XI opening pair, the highly impressive Shaun Marsh and fellow-Australian James Hopes, need to get off to a good start on whats expected to be another bouncy and pacy track.         
	Marsh has been particularly impressive in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and has the support of classy Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene, his compatriot Kumar Sangakkara (if fit) and the under-performing skipper, Yuvraj Singh, in the top order.         
	Mumbai Indians, fourth in the table, would be eager to settle the scores against the visitors to whom they lost by 66 runs in their away match on April 25 in Mohali. The match, however, was overshadowed by the infamous Harbhajan Singh-Sreesanth slapgate row.         
	Things have changed drastically for the hosts since that day with Sachin Tendulkar having regained his fitness to lead the side that have now hit a purple patch.         
	It was Pollock who led the turnaround from the front when the maestro was unavailable owing to a groin injury. More importantly for the hosts, Sanath Jayasuriya has rediscovered the sort of form which hes most known for and the visitors attack, led by the temperamental Sreesanth and Irfan Pathan, would be wary of what awaits them if they err even slighly in line and length with the Lankan ace and Tendulkar at the top of the Mumbai batting order.         
	Even when Jayasuriya fell for 36 against Deccan Chargers in their last match in Hyderabad, the rest of the batting line-up, including Tendulkar who made 23, contributed usefully so that the total reached close to 180, enough to take the match out of Adam Gilchrist amp; Co.s reach.         
	The home team would certainly be missing the services of West Indian all rounder Dwayne Bravo, who played his last tie in Hyderabad before flying home to take on Australia but the inclusion of his Caribbean teammate Dwayne Smith would certainly be welcomed.         
	Punjab XI attack, comprising Sreesanth, Pathan, VRV Singh, Hopes and Piyush Chawla does have some variety, especially now that off spinner Ramesh Powar has been given his first tie.

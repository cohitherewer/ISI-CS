The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Men like Redknapp worth every penny
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Men like Redknapp worth every penny
            HENRY WINTER            Harry Redknapp                           
	Ludicrously, eyebrows are being raised over the 5 million Tottenham Hotspur gave Portsmouth to release Harry Redknapp. For a club who spent a similar sum on Kevin-Prince Boateng, a midfield misfit too poor even to be granted a squad number at the Lane this season, Redknapps transfer fee constitutes a bargain.         
	When all the qualities that Redknapp brings are totted up, from man-management to shrewd recruitment, 5 million seems crazily cheap, yet still people ponder the size of the compensation. Try telling Pompey that 5 million is a fair swap for their most important employee.         
	A trade now exists in decent managers that increasingly reflects the established market for players. Compensation packages grow by the season. Steve Bruce cost Wigan Athletic 3 million when he moved from Birmingham City, and it has proved excellent business by Wigan chairman Dave Whelan. Languishing in 19th place when Bruce arrived last November, Wigan finished a comfortable 14th, guaranteeing them 30 million (while Birmingham slumped to an expensive relegation).         
	Manchester City paid Blackburn Rovers 5 million for Bruces old United teammate, Mark Hughes. Again, good business, particularly as Mark Bowen and Eddie Niedzwiecki were included in the compensation package. City gave Fiorentina almost a million more for Valeri Bojinov, a striker benighted by injuries.         
	Outstanding managers like Hughes arrive early at the training ground and leave late, often heading off to scout opponents or transfer targets. Few businesses are so reliant on one individuals energy and expertise.         
	A magazine found at most training grounds is The Manager, the regular bulletin from the League Managers Association, and the latest offering includes illuminating comments from Professor Chris Brady, Dean of Bournemouth Business School and adviser to the Football Associations Pro-Licence course.         
	Brady argues that managers must deliver immediately. If you dont produce the goods, youll be fired  and often that doesnt take long, he says. Research we conducted a few years ago found the average tenure of a Premier League manager to be 39 months compared to 46 for the CEO of a FTSE 100 company. (The life expectancy of both breeds has shortened recently).         
	Unlike CEOs, managers often attend the equivalent of AGMs twice a week, when those with a stake in the clubs fortunes, the supporters, loudly question their sanity and parentage.         
	When assessing the importance of a manager, events at Everton make a useful case study. The chairman, Bill Kenwright, cannot have written a more productive cheque than the 1 million despatched to Preston North End for the services of David Moyes.         
	In his first full season at Goodison, 2002-03, Moyes led Everton to seventh, an eight-place improvement on the previous year (in itself worth 4 million in merit money). Guiding Everton into the Champions League in 2004-05, albeit briefly, was a phenomenal feat, particularly as they had sold Wayne Rooney.         
	A significant development occurred at Goodison recently with Moyes reportedly becoming the clubs best-paid employee, his 16 million, five-year deal taking him ahead of the top earners on 45,000 a week. Good. Moyes motivates and buys well (Tim Cahill, Mikel Arteta, etc.) and deserves such rewards.         
	The manager should be the highest earner. It is absurd that Sir Alex Fergusons pay packet is half Cristiano Ronaldos. Fergusons glittering CV makes him immune from real criticism but the stress still remains, the spotlight still burns fiercest on him. Alone.         
	In the days when Ferguson was friendly with reporters, he would sit in his office the morning after a big match, munching through a mound of toast and surfing teletext to check whether the clubs share price had risen on the back of his teams success. Men like Ferguson make fortunes for their employers. No wonder the transfer market for top managers develops apace.

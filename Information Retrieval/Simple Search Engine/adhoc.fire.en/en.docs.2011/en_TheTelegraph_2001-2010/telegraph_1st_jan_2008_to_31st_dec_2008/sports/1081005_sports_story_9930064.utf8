The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ACA asks team to take care of Jason Krejza
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ACA asks team to take care of Jason Krejza
    - The day after the Australian spinners stunning revelation                             
	Melbourne: The Australian team in India has been asked by the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) to take care of Jason Krejza, following the spinners disclosure that he had tested positive for cocaine in 2006, after his drink had been spiked.         
	ACA chief executive Paul Marsh said he was satisfied with the handling of the Krejza matter by the player as well as the Cricket NSW, but felt there were concerns about the welfare of the 25-year-old, who is expected to make his Test debut against India in Bangalore next week.         
	I have contacted some of the guys in the team, asking them to let us know if there is anything we can do for him (Krejza), Marsh said.         
	I dont know what his state of mind is at the moment but we hope this storm blows over quickly so he can concentrate on his cricket because this is going to be a pretty important week for him, he was quoted as saying by an Australian daily on Saturday.         
	Marsh also confirmed that all players have been warned about the dangers of drink-spiking, and told to keep a close watch on their drinks in public places, according to the daily.         
	Meanwhile, it has emerged that Krejzas predecessor Colin Miller had also reported a similar incident to Cricket Australias chief medical officer Trefor James after he returned from Australias 2001 tour of India.         
	Miller said he lost 12 hours of his life after he was given a drink with some unusual lacing at a Melbourne hotel.         
	The off-spinner said he believed the substance was GBH, the drug also known as liquid ecstasy, and immediately reported his experience because he feared a positive drug test.         
	I know what Krejza is going through because it happened to me. It wasnt like anything I had felt with alcohol. I rang Trefor James straightaway and said my drinks been spiked because if I had been tested, I could have been rubbed out for two years or something, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand just a point from title
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anand just a point from title

      Pravin Thipsay        
	The eighth game of the World Championship match between challenger Vladimir Kramnik and defending champion Viswanathan Anand saw an exciting and hair-raising tactical battle in the middlegame, though the game finally ended in a draw by perpetual check after 39 moves. With this draw, the champion looks well set to retain his title.         
	Kramnik, who has had a bad run so far in the match with white pieces, probably played his best game with white on Friday. He opened with his favourite Queens Gambit. Despite having won the last two games with black in the Meran Variation of the Slav Defence, Anand decided to change his opening choice. He played a rare and sharp variation in the Queens Gambit Accepted, which gives white a dangerous attack at the cost of some positional concessions.         
	On move nine, Kramnik opted for a safer move with a bishop check, rather than the sharp double-edged main line. However, Anand came up with an interesting theoretical novelty on the 10th move that led to a very sharp position anyway.         
	Just like the third and fifth games, Anand once again gave up his right to castle in exchange for strong central pawn mass and control of key central squares.         
	On move 15, Kramnik initiated an attack against Anands king in centre but Anand occupied important central squares with his queen and rook, making it difficult for Kramnik to transfer his pieces near Anands king. Anand only had the other rook and some pawns defending his king but then no enemy pieces were permitted to go near it.         
	Kramnik first safeguarded his castled king, protected his pawn structure and then exchanged the powerfully placed enemy rook on move 24. Anand immediately brought his other rook to the central open file, intending a decisive invasion at Kramniks Q side through the central file. This, however, weakened the position of his king, allowing the challenger to launch an attack against it.         
	Kramnik invaded Anands camp with his queen on move 27 and sacrificed a pawn on the 32nd. Anand rejected the sacrificed pawn and kept his king well protected. Kramnik had a perpetual check in his hand but nothing more. With a powerful queen move, Anand cleared the path for his rook to get at the enemy forces. With the whole position about to cave in like a pack of cards, Kramnik had no choice but to give continuous checks to Anands exposed king, thereby forcing a draw with perpetual check.         
	With this draw, Anand now leads with 5.5 points to Kramniks 2.5. He is just one point from the magic figure of 6.5 required to retain the crown. Perhaps Saturdays game will be the last one of the championship!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Van Nistelrooy goal not offside: Uefa
                                                                                                                                                                                           Van Nistelrooy goal not offside: Uefa
                      
	Basel: The Netherlands controversial first goal in Mondays 3-0 group C victory over world champions Italy at Euro 2008 was correctly awarded despite many observers believing it was offside, organisers Uefa said on Tuesday.         
	Uefa general secretary David Taylor told a news conference the officials correctly interpreted Law 11 that relates to offside when Ruud van Nistelrooy scored after 26 minutes.         
	He stated that Christian Panucci played him onside although the Italian defender was off the pitch at the time.         
	The goal was correctly awarded. Not many people, even in the game, and I include the players, know this interpretation (of Law 11), Taylor said.         
	He conceded, however: The Law itself does not deal with this situation directly at all, but said that referees universally interpreted it in the way that the officials did on Monday night.         
	He said he had every sympathy with the footballing public for believing the officials called it wrong but said that Swedish referee Peter Frojdfeldt and his assistant Stefan Wittberg were absolutely correct in their interpretation.

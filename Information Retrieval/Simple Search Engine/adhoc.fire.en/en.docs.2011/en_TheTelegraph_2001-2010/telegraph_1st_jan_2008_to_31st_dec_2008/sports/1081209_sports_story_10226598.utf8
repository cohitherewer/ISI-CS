	We are deploying over 5000 people at the hotel and stadium. We have positioned 300 commandos at the hotel and 1000 police at outer periphery of the hotel have been deployed since Sunday morning. These men will be at job till the teams leave the city, he said.         
	Around 2000 police personnel, including highest level officers will be doing duty at the stadium till December 15, the last day of the Test, for smooth and successful conduct of the match, he added.         
	About the teams travel from the hotel to the stadium, he said an emergency route had been chalked out for the purpose.         
	We have in place emergency routes from hotel to stadium and back. We do not want to reveal them. We have made elaborate arrangements in this regard too. Our traffic police will clear the route at short notice whenever the emergency route is to be used, Balasubramaniam said.         
	Police have installed central access control system at vantage points and the players viewing area and also at the team hotel. The players will be advised to restrict their movements outside the hotel area.

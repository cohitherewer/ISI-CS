The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting escapes with fine
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ponting escapes with fine
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Australia captain Ricky Ponting on Monday escaped with a 20 per cent match fee fine after his team was found maintaining a slow over-rate in the fourth cricket Test against India.         
	Chris Broad of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees imposed the fines after Ricky Pontings side was ruled to be two overs short of its target when time allowances were taken into consideration, a statement from the International Cricket Council said.         
	The ICC Code of Conduct categorises slow over-rate as a Level 2 offence but it could be escalated to Level 3 if repeated. A Level 3 offence invites a ban of at least two Tests or four ODIs.         
	Ponting had earlier been fined twice for the same offence, in the Sydney and Perth Tests against India earlier this year.         
	The ICC statement, which usually elaborates on the charge, did not offer any explanation for the Match Referees lenient view of the Australians performance.

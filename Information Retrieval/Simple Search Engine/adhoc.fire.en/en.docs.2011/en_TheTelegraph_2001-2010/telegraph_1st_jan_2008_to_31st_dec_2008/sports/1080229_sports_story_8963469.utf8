                                                   Pity Rics advice not sought

	Indian hockey is bracing up for a crucial journey at the opposite end of the globe, which will perhaps have a bearing on the games future in the country.         
	The second qualifiers for an Olympic ticket will start in Santiago, Chile from Saturday and its as simple as perform-or-perish. India have never missed the quadrangular showpiece event since field hockey was introduced in 1928.         
	Russia and Mexico have replaced Bangladesh and Egypt in the six-team field. The new facility at the Prince of Wales Country Club in the Chilean capital will also see India vying for the next vacancy for Beijing with Austria, Chile and Great Britain.         
	India, who last won an Olympic gold in Moscow in 1980, have been forced to qualify after missing an Asian Games medal for the first time in Doha in 2006.         
	As India are getting ready for the Mexican challenge in the first match on Saturday, Im saddened a bit by the fact that we will be missing two-three key players at this hour of the need.         
	The absence of forward Sandeep Singh, Player of the PHL Arjun Halappa and goalkeeper Adrian DSouza could make a difference unless the current squad rises to the occasion and makes us proud. It remains to be seen how the two new rookies  penalty corner specialist Diwakar Ram and forward Ajitesh Roy  seize the opportunities which will come their way.         
	Im particularly aghast at this business of leaving Ric Charlesworth out of the picture. There has been pressure from both the government and International Hockey Federation to do well in Chile and yet, surprisingly, no help has been sought from the Australian great.         
	He is supposed to be part of our hockey as an advisor and his contact is yet to be completed. Some people may have their way of functioning and Rics presence may not be wanted in their scheme of things. However, I personally feel that its a pity Rics advice was not needed even with a rider.         
	This unfortunate controversy over Rajpal Singhs threat to pull out of the qualifiers has also happened at a wrong time. Although the winger has said the chapter is now closed for him, it shouldnt have happened at all just before the qualifiers.         
	Again, it can only happen in the subcontinent when Pakistan have recalled three former captains Wasim Ahmed, Rehan Butt and Mohammed Saqlain to the national camp. But there is no luck for Sohail Abbas, the scorer par excellence.         
	Pakistan, already Beijing-bound, are scheduled to play a Test series against China that will serve as a launching pad for them in their preparations. But I firmly believe that looking back to the past will help us go nowhere in world hockey and we must have an atmosphere where young bloods call the shots and create the future.         
	Let me end this article with a few words on the Indian Premier League (IPL). Im happy to see money pouring in such a big way in cricket and it may change the games perspective. I understand Geet Sethi and Rajyavardhan Singh Rathores apprehension that the IPL may block all roads to Beijing in that the money which could have gone to the sponsorship of athletes participating in the Olympics, might now flow to the Twenty20 extravaganza.         
	Just a few days ago, I had a chat with Mohinder Amarnath who also feared that the IPL would hamper development of junior cricket. I also believe money has to be linked to performance. If a bowler, for example, gets Rs 2 lakh for just a delivery, its not going to help the game at all.

	Newport: Australian Scott Strange secured his maiden European Tour title by winning the Wales Open by four strokes at Celtic Manor on Sunday.         
	Strange, 31, fired a closing seven-under 64 for a 22-under 262 total.         
	Swede Robert Karlsson, Stranges only serious challenger in the final round, also closed with a 64 as both players produced a glut of birdies.         
	Frenchman Raphael Jacquelin birdied the final hole for a 68 to secure third place on his own on 14-under.         
	Britons Darren Clarke, Nick Dougherty and Benn Barham, Italian Francesco Molinari and Argentine Rafa Echenique tied for fourth a further stroke back.         
	Indias Jeev Milkha Singh finished joint 10th after carding a final round par 71 for a four-day total of 11 under 273.         
	On Saturday, Jeev continued to hold steady with a two-under 69 in the penultimate round for a share of the third spot and a chance to end his 18-month title drought in the 1.8 million event.         
	Jeev was just four-strokes behind Strange, who also turned in a 69 to total 15-under 198 after three rounds.         
	Jeev was off the blocks with a birdie on the second hole. However, a dropped stroke on the fourth hole pulled him back.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       IPL a nice platform to get noticed: Gambhir
            A STAFF REPORTER            Gautam Gambhir                           
	Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir feels that the IPL is a good platform for the youngsters to prove themsleves.         
	The IPL is a fantastic tournament. I feel its a nice platform for the youngsters to prove themselves and come under the selectors radar, the 26-year Delhi DareDevils batsman told The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon.         
	Determined to continue his brilliant show with the bat, the Delhi left-hander, who is the leading run-scorer in the meet, said the IPL was one of the interesting things that happened in his life.         
	Its quite exciting being a part of the IPL. I am enjoying it, the opening batsman said.         
	With the crammed schedule for the cricketers, Gambhir said the game is different now.         
	Cricket is more than a game now. The game is changing everyday. Its quite different from what it was even a couple of years back. Players now know how to deal the tight schedule         
	Shifting from one format to another is not a problem because the players know how to handle the pressure they are very professionals now, said Gambhir.         
	You have to change your style and technique as per the demand of the game. Here (in Twenty20) technique hardly comes into play and you have to play as per the situation.

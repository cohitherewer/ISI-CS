            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Tuesdays match at the Eden will be a big test for the CAB and the state administration. Theres no doubt that the government had gone all out to ensure that there is no repeat of the fiasco that happened during the April 20 match. Unlike the first match of the Indian Premier League, the basic ground drills have been gone through this time before the Eden is thrown open for the match against Mumbai Indians. The following is a list of the measures that have been taken to ensure that the fiasco isnt repeated:         
	The pitch         
	Tuesdays match is being played on a new strip after the one used for the April 20 game evoked a lot of criticism. According to BCCI grounds and pitch committee chairman Daljit Singh, it will be a good batting track.         
	Deccan Chargers captain VVS Laxman described the pitch as shocking after losing to Kolkata Knight Riders. Australia captain Ricky Ponting also expressed similar sentiments and said curator Kalyan Mitra had apologised to the team.         
	According to Daljit, the new pitch has been prepared keeping in mind the requirements of the Twenty20 format.         
	They have watered it adequately and hope it will act according to the expectations of the crowd The batsmen can play their shots and bowlers will also have something in it, Singh said. Hope everything goes well tomorrow.         
	Floodlights         
	No specific reason could be identified for the 31-minute blackout but all agreed that the system, set up in 1992, was outdated. All the suggestions made by the expert committee have been adhered to. There will be a dedicated feeder line for the towers to ensure uninterrupted power supply. AC control rooms and manning by skilled personnel will ensure quality improvement. The chokes of the bulbs on the towers have been thoroughly checked, the earthing set right and loose wires removed.         
	Scoreboard         
	Engineers from a firm in Chennai, who have been camping in the city for a few days, have been working overtime to ensure smooth running of the electronic scoreboard. Dry runs have been carried out for the past few days. Some problems still persist with its contrast, but the CAB is hopeful it will be set right before the start on Tuesday.         
	Water         
	There is a demand for 3 lakh pouches of drinking water. Nearly 2.5 lakh pouches have been stored. Water tanks will be arranged near each block during the match. All measures have been taken to ensure there is an uninterrupted supply to the toilets on match days. Four mini control rooms have been set up to monitor the water supply.         
	Giant screens         
	Work is still not complete on one of the two giant screens that are being planned. It is expected to be ready before the start.

	Madrid: The United States won the doubles match Saturday to trail Spain 1-2 in the Davis Cup semi-finals.         
	Mike Bryan and Mardy Fish rallied to beat Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 on clay to give the US its first point after being swept in singles play Friday.         
	Olympic champions Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka gave Switzerland a spot in next years elite Davis Cup World Group on Saturday.         
	The pair beat Belgiums Xavier Malisse and Olivier Rochus 4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, 6-3 in their first doubles match since winning the gold in Beijing, giving Switzerland an unassailable 3-0 lead in the best-of-five playoff series.         
	Serbia will also be in the World Group next year after Viktor Troicki and Nenad Zimonjic beat Michal Mertinak and Filip Polasek 7-6, 6-4, 6-7, 7-6 to secure a 3-0 lead over Slovakia. Rafael Nadal can clinch Spains sixth final appearance by beating Andy Roddick in reverse singles on Sunday. David Ferrer of Spain plays Sam Querrey in the other match.         
	The winning team will face either Argentina or Russia, with the Argentines leading their semi-final in Buenos Aires.         
	Spain took advantage of the American pairs shaky serve early on to register the first break point and first set.         
	Fish, a last-minute replacement after Mike Bryans twin, Bob, pulled out with a shoulder injury, clinched the second set before Bryans backhand brought the key break on the way to securing the third set.         
	The US looked set to close it out when Verdasco floated a backhanded volley long for an early break in the fourth set, but Fish netted Lopezs forehand to force the decisive fifth set. A costly miss by Lopez gave the US the only break and ultimately the match in front of 20,000 people at Las Ventas bullfighting arena.         
	The US has won a record 32 Davis Cup titles but has rallied just once in 32 attempts when trailing 2-0  74 years ago against Britain.         
	The eighth-ranked Roddicks task to keep American hopes alive will be difficult against Nadal, a four-time French Open champion who has only lost two of his last 116 clay-court matches.         
	The Americans also won the doubles over Spain in the 2004 final at Seville, but the Spaniards went on to win their second title.         
	It was the first time in 16 Davis Cup matchups that the Bryans didnt feature together, although the US still won its eighth straight doubles match.         
	The new partnership needed time to settle, Spain breaking in the seventh game when Bryan hit long after a steady exchange of volleys.         
	Verdasco would clinch the set with a volley. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tweakers send Aussies into a tailspin in Nagpur
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tweakers send Aussies into a tailspin in Nagpur
  - India regain Border-Gavaskar Trophy after four years       K. KUMARASWAMY            Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and former captain Anil Kumble receive the Border-Gavaskar Trophy from Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar in Nagpur on Monday                                 
	Nagpur: Four years is not a long time in sport. But it could well be, if you are looking to get back something that you consider the most coveted in the game.         
	India ended their long wait to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on Monday, beating Australia by 172 runs in the fourth and final Test at the Jamtha Stadium.         
	The victory, which came exactly at the stroke of tea on the final day, meant India were 2-0 winners in the four-Test series. A result that would go a long way in assuaging the bitter 1-2 loss to the arch-rivals Down Under and wiping out the haunting memories of Monkeygate controversy during the Sydney Test earlier this year.         
	It would also exorcise the ghosts of 2004 when, ironically in the same city but at a different venue, the Aussies breached the Final Frontier.         
	In the process, India leaped to No. 2 spot in the ICC Test team rankings. The series win gave them seven ratings points to draw level with South Africa on 116. Graeme Smiths team, however, slipped just below India to third position by a fraction of a ratings point.         
	Chasing 382 to win, the Aussies were bowled out for 209 in 50.2 overs. Their response was restricted to a gallant 77 by Matthew Hayden and the 68-run fourth-wicket stand he shared with Mike Hussey (19).         
	Harbhajan Singh, who like Sourav Ganguly had missed the Test here four years ago, led the Aussie rout with four for 64 while Ishant Sharma (2/31) and Amit Mishra (3/27) lent good support.         
	Ishant was adjudged man of the series for his tally of 15 wickets, the highest in the series, while Jason Krejza, with a match haul of 12 for 358, was declared man of the match.         
	Krejza has been the only positive for Australia in this series. But that would be hardly a consolation for Ricky Ponting for whom this is the second series loss as a captain, the 2005 Ashes being the earlier one.         
	Crucially, the Aussies have not beaten India since Sydney. In the last six clashes, India have prevailed thrice, and the other three have ended in a stalemate.         
	Be it the Test match in Calcutta, 2001 or in the second Test at Mohali in the current series, the Australians have always adopted a one-dimension plan to go about their chase  take the attack to the opposition. Not surprisingly, they ended with the same fate on all three occasions.         
	Hayden and Katich attacked Zaheer Khan and Ishant from the outset. Katich drove Ishant to the mid-wicket fence in the second over of the day.         
	The southpaw perished when he miscued a cover drive off Ishant for a top edge and Dhoni took a well-judged catch.         
	Ponting fell to a Jonty Rhodes-like run out effort from Mishra at mid-off.         
	Michael Clarke, who had taken ill, batted with the assistance of a runner and did well to to maintain a brisk run-rate. But his innings came to an end when Ishant produced a superb delivery, identical to the one in the first innings, to induce an outside edge.         
	Hayden was then let-off twice, on 30 by Dhoni and 35 by Dravid, off Harbhajan. Those instances seemed to haunt the Indians as the burly Queenslander, in the company of Mike Hussey, decided to go after the Indian bowling.         
	He swatted Harbhajan for two fours before lifting Sehwag into the stands in successive overs. His blistering form, combined with Husseys astute batting at the other end, forced Dhoni to change his field set-up.         
	Just when things looked like getting out of the Indians hands, Mishra beat Hussey with bounce and turn for a straightforward catch to Dravid.         
	Thereafter, the Indians completed the formalities by demolishing the Australian lower order cheaply.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indias steady progress on gloomy day
                                                                                                                                                                                           Indias steady progress on gloomy day
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Mohali: Mahendra Singh Dhonis words came true as Rahul Dravid ended his string of poor scores with an effective and unbeaten knock of 65 in the second Test match against England on Friday.         
	Giving him company at the end of day one was opener Gautam Gambhir, who struck his third century in four Tests (106 batting) to take India to a position of strength at the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) Stadium.         
	On a gloomy day, when poor light curtailed play to 72 overs, India progressed rather slowly to finish at 179 for one. The match started 20 minutes late and had to be called off 45 minutes before the scheduled close.         
	On Thursday Dhoni predicted it was only a matter of time before Dravid came good with the bat. Once he gets a score of 30, Dravid would get back his confidence. After all, all of us are aware of his class, the Indian captain declared.         
	Dravids knock also vindicated his captains decision to persist with him at his usual No. 3 position despite the prolonged slump in form. Coming in at a time when the visitors were baying for blood after the early dismissal of Virender Sehwag, the former India captain had an uncertain start but played a solid innings to steer India out of the woods.         
	After Dhoni won the toss and decided to bat, India got into trouble as seamer Stuart Broad, who returned to the squad after recovering from his hamstring injury, had Sehwag caught behind for a duck in the second over. Encouraged by the early success, the England pacemen bowled with precision and the Indians hardly found room to free their arms.         
	So dominating were the English seamers that the home team could only manage 15 runs in the first 10 overs. While Dravid looked shaky, misjudging and miscuing on a number of occasions, a normally exuberant Gambhir was bogged down by Broad, Anderson and Flintoff.         
	The situation changed only after Dravid stylishly pulled Anderson for a four in the 18th over. It was the first boundary hit in five innings by the sixth highest run-getter in the history of Test cricket.         
	Thereafter, Gambhir and Dravid gradually took control of the proceedings with the former being the dominating partner. The Delhi left-hander looked at ease against the England bowlers, who till then had managed to keep the Indian duo under check.         
	Gambhir was particularly harsh on Monty Panesar and never allowed the left arm spinner to settle down. He stepped out to hit Panesar for two fours in one over when England captain Kevin Pietersen decided to introduce the spinner from the pavilion end.         
	Overall, it was a near flawless innings from the Indian opener, who has been scoring consistently for the past few months. The only time he committed a mistake was when he edged a delivery from Graeme Swann to the slips only to be dropped by Collingwood.         
	Gambhir then was on 70 and went on to score his second back to back century at this venue. I am only 150 odd runs away from scoring thousand runs in a calendar year. So, my target was to score as many runs, said Gambhir, who hit 12 boundaries and one six.         
	Dravid, on the other hand, slowly settled down and opened up during the later stages of his innings. True, it wasnt exactly a glorious knock from the veteran batsman but a few of his shots reminded of his golden days.         
	The drive off Panesar that pierced the crowded off-side and raced to the boundary had class written all over it.         
	England coach Peter Moores later said: We know Dravid is a fantastic batsman. A good batsman does not become a bad batsman overnight. We could have got him but he settled down and played a fine innings.

	New Delhi: The England and Wales Cricket Boards security expert Reg Dickason will make a recce of the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Wednesday and visit Mohali on Thursday before submitting his report which will determine whether England will return to play the two-Test series in India.         
	A top BCCI source said that Dickason will inspect the stadium and hotel and discuss various issues with security agencies during his day-long visit to Chennai.         
	He will then proceed to Mohali and undertake a similar exercise. The sources said that Dickason will also have detailed discussion with top BCCI officials regarding the security arrangements.         
	Dickason was with the England team which returned home abruptly after the terror attacks in Mumbai. He has been entrusted with the task of submitting a report to the ECB, which will then determine the fate of the series.         
	The source said that the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) has already got an assurance from police authorities that fool-proof security will be provided for the match in Chennai.         
	The ECB has not sought a letter of guarantee from the police authorities. But we have got the police assurance that fool-proof security will be provided, the source said.         
	The source said that Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) have still not discussed the security arrangements with Punjab Police and will be doing so soon.         
	In a bid to salvage the Test series, the BCCI has revised the schedule and has chosen Chennai and Mohali as the two new venues instead of terror-hit Ahmedabad and Mumbai.         
	As per the revised schedule, Chennai will host the first Test from December 11 to 15 while the second Test will be played in Mohali from December 19 to 23.           (AGENCIES)

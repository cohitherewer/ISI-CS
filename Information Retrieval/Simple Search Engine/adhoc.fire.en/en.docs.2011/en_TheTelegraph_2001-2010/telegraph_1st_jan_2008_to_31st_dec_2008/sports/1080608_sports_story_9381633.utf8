	Nottingham: England reduced New Zealand to 45 for two at tea after following on and edged nearer to a series win on day three of the third and final Test at Trent Bridge on Saturday.         
	Brendon McCullum was 16 not out and Ross Taylor was on eight as they battled against the swinging ball in overcast conditions, which brightened shortly before the interval.         
	New Zealand trailed England by 196 runs.         
	Aaron Redmond was caught behind off Stuart Broad for two and first innings top-scorer Jamie How was caught at third slip by Alastair Cook off Ryan Sidebottom for 19.         
	The ball before Hows dismissal, McCullum had survived a confident caught behind appeal off Broad. But umpire Darrell Hair was unmoved and replays showed bat flicking pad.         
	England are 1-0 up in the series after drawing at Lords and winning at Old Trafford, need only to avoid defeat to win the series.           (REUTERS)

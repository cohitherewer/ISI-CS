                                                                                                                                                                                                       Asif released from detention
                  Mohammed Asif                     
	Dubai/Karachi: Pakistani pacer Mohammed Asifs 19-day ordeal eventually came to an end on Thursday after the authorities in Dubai decided to release him from detention for carrying contraband drugs.         
	Asif is expected be deported to Pakistan within a couple of days, Dr Zafar Ali, media chancellor of Pakistan embassy in United Arab Emirates (UAE), said.         
	The public prosecutor has decided against pressing any charges against Asif as such and it has been decided to deport him immediately, Zafar said.         
	The case has been dropped against Asif due to insignificance... He will be deported as soon as the police finalise the procedures, public prosecutor Mohammed Al Nuaimi, who handled the case in Dubai, was quoted as saying by the online version of a newspaper.         
	It is definite that he committed the crime of smuggling and possessing opium as he was caught red-handed ... However in certain cases and for a faster litigation process the public prosecution drops a case due to insignificance and deports the suspect, he said.         
	Asif was in detention since June 1 when he was caught carrying contraband drugs at Dubai airport on his way back home from India after his stint in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Another official of Pakistan embassy in Dubai, Salahuddin Khan said the paper work for the cricketers deportation was complete.         
	We are hopeful that Mohammed Asif will be released shortly in Dubai, said Salahuddin, who was assisting Asif on behalf of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).         
	The news of Asifs deportation will also bring some relief for the PCB as it was trying to get the pacer released early.         
	The PCB has said it would hold its own internal inquiry once Asif returns home but refused to comment any further on the issue insisting they still did not know details of the incident.         
	Meanwhile, forensic examinations had confirmed that Asif was in possession of the banned recreational drug opium. It is believed that the pacer had 0.24gms of opium in his wallet.

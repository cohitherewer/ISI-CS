            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Australian opener Matthew Hayden is confident that his team will fight back and save the third Test at the Kotla.         
	So far we have batted well, Hayden said at the end of the day. The pitch is still a good batting track. The more time we spend on the wicket, the greater the pressure will be on India.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q On the match situation         
	A Losing four wickets for 300 is a comfortable situation at the end of the day. Australia are confident of building on that score with a strong batting line-up to follow. They are good players of spin although these are challenging conditions.         
	Do you think it could have been better?         
	Yes, certainly. It was frustrating to see the top three batsmen falling after getting half-centuries. But still it was a satisfying day for us. The situation will be challenging tomorrow.         
	Will you be able to save the match?         
	We have batted well. The pitch is still a good batting track. The more time we spend on the wicket, the pressure will be on India.         
	Do you think the absence of Harbhajan Singh was an advantage for you?         
	May be. But both Anil (Kumble) and Amit (Mishra) bowled admirably. We also faced them with distinction. Interestingly, Sehwag also got some spin and bowled really well. He had spin, speed and variation. He is not an enormous turner of the ball like Harbhajan, but reads the conditions well.         
	You got a good score after a long time         
	Yes. Today I really set out to bat for a long time. I was pretty relaxed and adopted a traditional approach of occupying the crease and capitalising on the loose balls. I am disappointed that I did not get a big score.         
	What about reverse swing here?         
	See, back in Mohali, the only time I could score was during the first 15 overs when the reverse swing wasnt much of a threat. But the innings here required a more traditional type of batting since India had already scored 600 runs.

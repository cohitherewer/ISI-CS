	Madrid: Real Madrid lost 0-1 against Deportivo Coruna in the Primera Liga on Saturday as they failed to break their jinx at the Riazor.         
	The Spanish champions have not won in La Coruna since November 1991 and never looked like breaking the sequence after losing to a second-half own-goal by Portugal defender Pepe.         
	Real stay eight points clear of second-placed Barcelona, who have 54, but Frank Rijkaards side can close to within five with a win in Almeria in their next game.         
	The match between Real Betis and Athletic Bilbao at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera was abandoned midway through the second half with the score at 2-1 after Bilbao goalkeeper Armando was hit in the face by a bottle thrown from the stands.         
	Armando had stitches for a cut near his eye.         
	In the late game, Brazil striker Luis Fabiano took his tally for the season to 22 with both goals in Sevillas 2-0 win at Valencia.         
	Real lacked pace and ideas at the Riazor as they were comfortably kept at bay by a Depor side steadily growing in confidence.         
	The game turned against the visitors when Depors Brazilian defender Filipe cut in from the left flank and crossed to t he near post in the 58th minute and the ball flew past Iker Casillas off Pepes outstretched knee.         
	It was Reals fourth away defeat from their last five games in all competitions.         
	In Italy, AS Roma produced a stunning comeback to beat AC Milan 2-1 and move within three points of Serie A leaders Inter on Saturday.         
	Second-half substitutes Ludovic Giuly and Mirko Vucinic scored three minutes apart after Milan had taken a deserved lead through Kaka.         
	Milan, who missed the chance to go above Fiorentina into the fourth Champions League spot, had several chances to wrap up the game before the fightback.         
	Roma made sure they could capitalise on any Inter slip up among the uncertainty, but they took their time at the Stadio Olimpico.Milan had much the better of the first half with Kaka heading wide twice. The visitors continued to press early in the second half and were rewarded when Kaka struck Massimo Oddos pullback into the roof of the net.         
	The game looked over but Roma boss Luciano Spalletti, who masterminded the defeat of Real Madrid in the Champions League first knockout round, made two inspired substitutions.         
	But Frenchman Giuly introduced himself by pulling the home side level on 78 minutes before Vucinic, who grabbed the winner when Roma won 1-0 at Milan in October, slotted in from Daniele De Rossis ball.         
	Roma were infuriated at the end of the first half when a quickly-taken corner was disallowed.         
	David Pizarro touched the ball at the corner spot before wandering away and leaving Rodrigo Taddei to suddenly appear and run with the ball towards goal. The officials ruled Pizarros touch had not been adequate.         
	Earlier sixth-placed Udinese salvaged a 2-2 draw at home to Lazio thanks to Antonio Di Natales late goal.         
	Lazio, who have risen to 11th after looking in relegation trouble at the turn of the year, went ahead twice through Tommaso Rocchi and Cristian Ledesma only for Damiano Ferronetti and Italy forward Di Natale to equalise.

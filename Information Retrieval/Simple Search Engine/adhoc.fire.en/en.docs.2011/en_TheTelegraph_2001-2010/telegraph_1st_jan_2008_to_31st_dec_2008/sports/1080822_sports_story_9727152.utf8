                                                                                                                                                                                                       My Mission Beijing not yet over, says Vijender Kumar
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT              Vijender Kumar                        
	New Delhi: On Thursday, when the nation was still celebrating Vijender Kumars entry into the semi-finals, the boxer had no time for it.         
	Instead the champion boxer and his support staff got themselves huddled in a room at the Olympic Village and were busy discussing strategies for Fridays bout against mighty Emilio Correa Bayeaux of Cuba.         
	We have no time for celebrations, said the 75kg pugilist when contacted in Beijing. I cannot lower my guards at this stage.         
	From back home, I am getting lots of phone calls. People there are really happy with my performance but I cannot join the celebrations at the moment. My Mission Beijing is not yet over.         
	Vijenders Cuban rival is a two-time Pan-American champion and certainly starts favourite. But the Indian boxer is unperturbed and believes that he has a chance of going a step ahead in the competition.         
	Since I have reached this far, there is no reason why I should not aim for the gold medal, said Vijender confidently. But at the moment, I am only thinking about the semi-final. Once I manage to win it, I will give a serious thought to the final.         
	The Indian camp is well aware of the Cubans reputation as one of the leading contenders for the top slot in the 75 kg category. Indian coach GS Sandhu and the rest of the support staff have analysed the Cubans playing style time and again and have already briefed Vijender about it.         
	Vijender is taller than his opponent, thats his advantage, Sandhu said. It is not easy to predict the result. At this stage of the competition, anyone can be the winner.         
	The Indian coach admitted that Vijender will meet a highly skillful rival on Friday. The Cuban is definitely very good. But we also have our plans ready. If Vijender can execute it, he will create history.         
	Vijender also endorsed his coachs views. I have not come all the way to Beijing to lose easily, he said. He may be a great boxer but that does not matter. Dont forget, how Akhil (Kumar) got the better of the world champion in his category the other day.         
	What have I got to lose if I go down to a man of bigger reputation? I will enter the ring tomorrow with a free mind, he said.         
	In amateur boxing, the Cubans are generally regarded the best in the world. To add to it, Bayeaux is in Beijing to emulate his father, Emilio Correa Valiant, who also won the Olympic gold in the welterweight category in 1972 Munich.         
	Can Vijender bring an end to a family tradition?

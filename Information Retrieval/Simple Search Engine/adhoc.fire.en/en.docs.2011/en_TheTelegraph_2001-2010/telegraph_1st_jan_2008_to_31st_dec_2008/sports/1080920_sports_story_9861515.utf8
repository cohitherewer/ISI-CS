	New Delhi: Peerless Sports Club will be Bengals representatives in the East Zone Federation Cup qualifiers starting at Siwan from September 25.         
	Peerless, relegated from the Calcutta Premier Division league this season, were selected on the basis of their last years performance.         
	Last year, they finished fifth in the local league. As per the AIFF instruction, we recommended their name in May, IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly said.         
	Four I-League teams from Calcutta  Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, Mohammedan Sporting and United SC  will automatically play in the final rounds of the Federation Cup.         
	The best finishers in the local league generally receive the invitation to play in the qualifiers.

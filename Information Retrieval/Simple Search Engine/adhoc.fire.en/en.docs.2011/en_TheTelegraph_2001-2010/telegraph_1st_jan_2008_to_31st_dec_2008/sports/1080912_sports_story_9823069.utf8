	IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly cut short his business trip and had to rush to the associations office within a couple of hours of returning from London.         
	The secretarys last-minute negotiations probably saved the day for the Sahara CFL Premier Division, which has already seen fixtures being changed on numerous occasions.         
	The drama started with Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra sending a letter to the IFA alleging foul play in Wednesdays Mohammedan Sporting-Calcutta Port Trust match. Mitra also requested the association to reschedule the tie against East Bengal and hold it simultaneously with Mohammedan Sportings final match against United SC on the same day and time.         
	However, Mohammedan Sporting supporters laid siege to the IFA office from noon and voiced their displeasure against any changes in the fixtures.         
	Fridays match is on We have a limited infrastructure. I have considered all possible options and this is the best option, Ganguly said in a news conference.         
	I am sending a fax to Mohun Bagan and will request them to play tomorrow. We understand their concerns and we will make sure that the issues are kept in mind while making next years schedule.         
	Ganguly also disclosed that the IFA will appoint three former Fifa referees as observers for Saturdays last league match between Mohammedan Sporting and United SC.         
	After receiving the fax from the parent body, Mohun Bagan, in an executive committee meeting, decided to play the match. Mitra, however, stuck to his claim that the tie between Mohammedan Sporting and CPT was fixed.         
	According to sources, Mohammedan Sporting are mulling action against Mitra.

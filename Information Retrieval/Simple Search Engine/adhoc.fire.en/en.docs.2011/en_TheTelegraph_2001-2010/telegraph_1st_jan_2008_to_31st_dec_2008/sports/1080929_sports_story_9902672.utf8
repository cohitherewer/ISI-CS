    - Practice match ends in a draw                   Jason Krejza                           
	Jaipur: Australian bowlers compensated for their batsmens failure and came up with an impressive performance to bundle out RCA Centre of Excellence team for a paltry 122 to end the two-day practice game on a draw here on Sunday.         
	The visitors, who were all out for 218 on Saturday, decided to end the match with the fall of the last RCA wicket, an hour after the lunch interval. The visitors then practised among themselves instead of continuing with the game.         
	Ricky Pontings team took just 52.3 overs to bundle out the RCA team with rookie pacer Dough Bollinger and inexperienced spinner Jason Krejza returning figures of three for nine and three for 35 respectively.         
	Strike bowler Brett Lee also bowled well to dismiss dangerman and captain Venugopal Rao and returned figures of two for 17.         
	Young fast bowler Peter Siddle and his senior Stuart Clark took one wicket each.         
	Left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Johnson went wicketless in his eight overs.         
	Resuming the day at 38 for two, overnight batsmen Khoda and Rao were tied down by the Australian bowlers and they added just 15 runs in 10 overs before Lee claimed the home team captain for 20 off a quick delivery.         
	Venugopal had faced 63 balls and hit three boundaries before perishing.         
	Khoda was caught by wicketkeeper Brad Haddin off Siddle for 33 and the home team were tottering at 57 for four at that point.         
	The Rajasthan team then had a brief period of resistance for 14 overs that yielded 25 runs for the fifth wicket. Robin Bist  the home teams top-scorer  was then out for 34 and with his departure all hopes of any fight back evaporated.         
	Bist played a patient innings, facing 92 balls and hit four fours.         
	The next five batsmen added 40 runs from 77 balls. By the lunch interval the home team were reduced to 97 for seven.         
	The RCA innings folded for 122, less than an hour after the lunch break. Wicketkeeper Rohit Jhalani and pacer Pankaj Singh failed to score while Mohan Singh remained not out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beckham: Im still committed to Galaxy
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Beckham: Im still committed to Galaxy
                      
	Carson: David Beckham insists he will stay with the Los Angeles Galaxy regardless of any possible loan to Italian power AC Milan.         
	At the end of the day, my committment is still to the Galaxy and thats not changed, Beckham said after training on Saturday. But Ive been given a chance to join up with one of the biggest clubs in the world, so Im going to do that.         
	The Galaxy are not against it. Theyve made that clear. They said that if I want to do that, then theyre prepared to let me go there on loan until our season.         
	AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani said he wants to bring Beckham to Italy on a loan. If the loan takes place, Beckham would arrive in January.         
	At the end of the day, its looking like it could happen, Beckham said. Hopefully, it will be finalised in the next week or two.         
	Major League Soccer deputy commissioner Ivan Gazidis said on Thursday the loan would be approved only if it makes sense for Los Angeles and Beckham, who signed a five-year contract in January 2007.         
	One issue concerns whether Beckham will return to Los Angeles for the preseason in March or for the first regular-season game.         
	At the moment, its not even certain yet, Beckham said of the loan. Were still talking to Milan. Its (for) a two-month spell, maybe a little bit longer.         
	Teammate Landon Donovan, who has talked about possibly playing in Europe after this season, criticised the timing of Beckhams pursuit of a loan agreement.

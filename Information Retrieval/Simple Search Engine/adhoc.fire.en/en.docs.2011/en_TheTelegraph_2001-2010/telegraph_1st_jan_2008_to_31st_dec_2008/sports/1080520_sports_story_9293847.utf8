The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Salary cap should stay: Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Salary cap should stay: Ponting
                      
	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting is against the proposed super-contracts in the IPL as he feels having no cap on players salary will adversely affect the competitiveness of the tournament.         
	There is a proposal that the salary cap will be removed allowing the top players to get a whopping $14-15 million worth contracts.         
	Currently the salary cap for each team is $5 million and Ponting believes it should stay if the organisers dont want to ruin the League.         
	I have certainly heard there may be no salary cap next year but Im not sure if that will be good for the IPL, Ponting was quoted as saying in an Australian daily.         
	It might be detrimental to the whole set-up, he said.         
	Meanwhile, IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi on Monday described talks of lifting the cap as hypothetical.         
	All players have been bought (by the franchise owners) for three years. Its hypothetical (to say) cap will be lifted, he said in a news conference. (PTI)

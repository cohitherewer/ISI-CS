                            Ajantha  Mendis          
	New Delhi: Unlocking the Ajantha Mendis mystery on Sri Lankan pitches will not be difficult for Indian batsmen if they concentrate on his wrist movement, feels former India captain Gundappa Viswanath.         
	Having excelled against Australian John Gleeson  another mystery spinner who flummoxed batsmen with his odd grip  in his 1969-70 debut series, Viswanath said taking on Mendis in the upcoming Test series wont be difficult once the Indian batsmen carefully observe his wrist movement.         
	Youve got to pick him (Mendis) up at the time of delivery. Our batsmen need to observe Mendis wrist and finger movements at the time of delivery...Then hell become easier to negotiate, the 59-year-old said on the sidelines of a Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA) function on Sunday night.         
	Recollecting his famous debut against the Australians in the November, 1969 Kanpur Test  where he scored a first innings duck before coming up with an exquisite 137 in the second innings  Viswanath said: I had heard a lot about Gleeson...That hes very tough and difficult to play against before going in to bat in my first Test. But in the first innings, I didnt get to face him as I got out to (Alan) Connolly.         
	But I faced him (Gleeson) in the second innings. I carefully saw Gleesons wrist movement at the time of delivery and he became predictable I could easily score runs against him Viswanath said.         
	Refusing to compare Mendis with fellow Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan, Viswanath said: Its too early to compare Mendis with somebody who has 700-plus Test wickets in his kitty. Mendis is yet to play a Test...           (PTI)

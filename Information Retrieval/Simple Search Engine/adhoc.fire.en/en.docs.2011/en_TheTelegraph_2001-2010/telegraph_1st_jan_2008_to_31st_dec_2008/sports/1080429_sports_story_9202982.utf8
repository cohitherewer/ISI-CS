                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bagan may host I-League ties 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       
	New Delhi: Mohun Bagan may host some of the I-League matches this season, according to IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Monday, Ganguly said he was keen to create two more venues in and around Calcutta for the second edition of the I-League.         
	I have already spoken to the AIFF in this regard and have requested them to consider Mohun Bagan ground along with the stadium at Kalyani or Siliguri as permanent I-League venues, apart from the Salt Lake Stadium and the Barasat stadium, he said.         
	Regarding imposition of levy on Bengal Peerless for hosting the Bayern Munich-Mohun Bagan match, the IFA secretary said he expected the AIFF to take a softer stand.         
	I am quite happy with the way the AIFF has been helping us for smooth conduct of the match, Ganguly said. The AIFF has assured me that the executive committee may try to waive off the levy when it meets in New Delhi on Tuesday, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Calcutta referee Subrata Sarkar is likely to officiate the Bayern match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumble: Not a sudden decision
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kumble: Not a sudden decision
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: For a few seconds, there was pin drop silence in the chaotic media room at the Kotla when Anil Kumble walked in to address the reporters for the last time as an India cricketer. And as the third highest wicket-taker in the history of Test cricket was about to sit down, everyone present in the room broke into instant applause.         
	The skipper wore a pleasant smile but when he started to speak, the emotion that was playing in his mind could be felt.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Q: Why did you quit all of a sudden?         
	A: It was not a sudden decision... My body had been telling me that its time now... After all, I have been bowling for the past 18 years. Finally, when I got injured on the third day of the match, I decided to quit.         
	Did you inform the board officials?         
	I did inform my teammates one by one, the chief of the selection committee and the people in the board, who matter the most. I told them this is the last day of Test cricket for me.         
	Was it tough to take such a decision?         
	Yes, its always tough (to take such a decision).... But Delhi is a very special place  first as a cricketer and then as a team we have fantastic records here. Anyway, I had decided that this will be my last series So I decided last night that I should quit.         
	Were you hurt by the recent criticism?         
	See criticism is a part and parcel of life... For me, criticism started 18 years ago when I started playing Test cricket... Some said I was not good enough for even two Tests... But when I could not play these last two Tests, I looked back at my career. Im not able to take the grind any more. It is difficult to continue like this. I dont take a call based on criticism.         
	Will you play in the IPL?         
	Thats different. I have contractual obligations towards my franchise. So I will take a call on that later.         
	How do you sum up your career overall?         
	I think there has to be different phases when you play for such a long time. I had gone through difficult phases at the start of my career when people questioned my ability, my fitness, my bowling, and the effectiveness of my bowling. It continued till the end. But when I look back I feel I have done well. After I suffered a shoulder injury, I played for eight years. Surely the second phase was more satisfying. We won more matches in the West Indies, Pakistan, Australia. They were all very challenging but to come out triumphant was satisfying.         
	What kept you on?         
	My self belief. I had strong belief in my capabilities and my team knew what I am capable of. They should respect you. I know I have given my 100 per cent. Its a game you win one day and then lose one day. As a team we have shown a lot of resilience in past few months. It was just one bad series in Sri Lanka. India is the team which has competed against the Aussies. I think the team has done very well.         
	Do you have any regrets?         
	I dont have any regrets. I have given my 100 per cent. But I cherish many things like my first series in 1990 under (Mohammed) Azharuddin. Kotla is very special as I got a 10-wicket haul here. I also cherish Test victories all over the world against Australia in 2004, the West Indies and Pakistan.         
	Is your finger better now?         
	Yes, better. I dont know how I cut myself so bad. I could see my flesh. I got 11 stitches. Doctors said I needed to be given anaesthesia and here I was needed to make a cricketing decision as it was going to waste a lot of time. My stitches would come out only on November 8. I could have played in the next Test but it is not easy, I could not have given 100 per cent and I did not want my team to suffer because of this.         
	How would you like to be remembered?         
	I would like to be remembered as someone who gave his 100 per cent every time he went out there. I would like to be remembered as someone who had shared the dressing room with Sachin (Tendulkar), (V.V.S.) Laxman, Rahul Dravid, Sourav (Ganguly) and youngsters like Viru (Virender Sehwag), M.S. (Dhoni), Harbhajan (Singh), Zaheer (Khan). When I started my career I was with Kapil (Dev) Paaji, Azhar, Ravi and all. I would also like to be remembered as someone who raised the bar for the team, someone who took 600 plus wickets for the first time in India, which is a good sign.         
	How do you look at the future of Indian cricket?         
	I believe that in terms of results the Indian cricket has gone further since the time I started my career. Its only going to improve with the coming generations because you want to do better than your predecessors. Im confident that the young team, with some of the seniors still a part of it, would dominate the world. We are already the number one team in the Twenty20 and approaching the top in ODI and just a little way behind in Tests.         
	Why do you pass your cap to Sachin Tendulkar before you start bowling? What did you tell him today?         
	I and Sachin have spent a lot of time in dressing room. It all started here in 1999 when I would give him the cap and he would say I would get a wicket in that over. Today I told him that this was the last time I was giving him the cap. He said I would get a wicket. Unfortunately, I did not get a wicket.         
	Was taking a decision to retire tougher than taking a wicket?         
	It was slightly easier because your body tells you how far you can go. I took painkillers to play but the injury happened and I said to myself I cant take it anymore. I wasnt satisfied with the level of commitment I was giving.         
	Will you travel to Nagpur?         
	Really, I would have liked to finish in Nagpur but I told you about the injury. I would be there to see Souravs last match and Laxmans 100th Test and I would also like to be a part of the team in its celebrations.         
	What are you going to do now?         
	Well, I am still trying to learn how to bowl leg-spin (laughs). Seriously, I will now be able to spend more time with my family. I know you will now start calling me for quotes. Give me a break for a few days and I promise to take all your calls. Thank you.

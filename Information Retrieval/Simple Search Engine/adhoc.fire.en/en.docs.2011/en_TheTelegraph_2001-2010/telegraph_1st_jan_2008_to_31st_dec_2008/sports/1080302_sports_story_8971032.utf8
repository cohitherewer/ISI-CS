The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ive got a young team which thinks in the right direction, says Dhoni 
                                                     Ive got a young team which thinks in the right direction, says Dhoni 
  - Finals or not, the captain and his players have to get the basics right:Team India ODI captain       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Sydney: Theres enormous pressure going into the tri-series finals, but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been cooler than a cucumber (Im chilled he quipped).         
	On Saturday afternoon, Dhoni took time off at the Radisson Plaza to take some questions from The Telegraph. A couple of hours earlier, hed addressed a press conference at the SCG.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Significance of the finals for him as captain         
	When youre captaining, you dont look at whether its the finals or some other match... Finals or not, the captain and his players have to get the basics right.         
	A captains role         
	He doesnt do everything and the role of the players is important... Whether Im captain or not, theres responsibility on my shoulders.         
	On whether, being the captain, hed been under pressure when the tri-series began on February 3         
	There was a bit of pressure, yes, as a lot of things (captains team etc.) were being said ... But players can only get experience once theyve got exposure... Personally, though, I didnt think this team was short on experience. Rather, Id say Ive had a team with a nice mix of experience and young blood. The players are giving 100 per cent and, as important, are enjoying their cricket. Theyve reduced the pressure on me and thats reason to be happy.         
	This being the team for the future         
	Its not that one will have faith in the youngsters only if we win the finals... The way theyve shaped up in the tournament has been amazing... A huge number of people were doubting this teams capabilities, but nobody shouldve been doing so... It may take time (to deliver), but that happens in international cricket... This team has plenty of ability and, hopefully, well be at our best in the finals. A win will definitely give the youngsters loads of confidence... If youre looking to the 2011 World Cup, except maybe one or two players, this will probably be the team for that tournament.         
	Not being able to give overworked Ishant Sharma a break         
	Because of the situation we were in earlier in the tournament...         
	The Australians being a bigger threat in finals         
	Its not about what theyve done in the previous finals... Its about us believing in our abilities... Having said that, its also not about what we did in the last match (versus Sri Lanka in Hobart), but doing the right things properly both tomorrow and later... The team which plays better over the 100 overs will emerge the winner.         
	Whether his players have peaked         
	It couldnt be a better situation, especially if you go back to the first match played by this team, the Twenty20 International (on February 1), which we lost... The bowlers have been doing very well and the batsmen are getting some runs... Weve been fielding well and our running between the wickets has been excellent. Id say were at our best, but we can still get better... Indeed, it will be important to stick to the good things weve been doing. Of course, winning is important, but winning isnt everything.         
	The pressure factor         
	Look, one needs to get the basics right... Sometimes you get desperate to win and thats when the pressure mounts... One needs to avoid that as it could bog you down... Its when youre relaxed that youre at your best. You could have a situation where the team isnt under pressure. Equally, there could be situations when the pressure is quite high... Its best, I believe, to treat the finals as just another set of matches.         
	The importance of winning the first final         
	Doing so will put the opposition under pressure... The Australians look to dominate and its not often that theyre put under pressure... Theyve been under pressure in this tournament and its important for us to quickly gain the upperhand tomorrow. For that, well have to keep up the pressure.         
	Talk of history and so on         
	Whatever you do, good or bad, it becomes a part of history... So, you dont have to look to create it...         
	On Sri Lanka stunning Australia at the MCG on Friday, a match which didnt have a bearing         
	Im more concerned about my team, not what happened to Australia.         
	The finals marking the start of the last stretch of what has been a long tour for many         
	Well, yes... Ive asked the players to just go out and give their best without worrying about the result... Irrespective of what happens on the field (in the best-of-three finals), the players will be home in a few days... They shouldnt be thinking about it, though.         
	The XI for Sunday         
	Havent finalised the combination... The wicket looks to be a good batting track... It looked wet this morning, because of the watering, and well have to wait and see how it looks tomorrow afternoon... Too many things are going on in the mind... There are options and Ill leave the decision till the last minute... Getting the right combination may look simple, but options often make it difficult... If the wicket isnt damp, one should bat first.         
	On the recent controversies         
	Throughout this tournament, a lot has been said about certain individuals and some things, but I feel its been a good tri-series with some performing at their best. Its important to talk of cricket and not some of the things that have been said. Its because of cricket that were here.         
	Having got his players to largely stay calm         
	Credit to the players, whove been sensible... Ive got a young team which thinks in the right direction... I havent had to do anything very different as captain... Whether weve won or lost, the dressing room hasnt seen too much of mood swings. I see this as a big positive.         
	Ricky Pontings comment that theres something in the Sydney water         
	(Laughs) Our matches have always seen aggression... As for the water, we could send a few samples to the lab and get them tested! Well be able to find out whats going on... I dont, however, think that the water here makes a difference as we only drink the mineral kind.         
	Whether the first final could see an explosion         
	Hopefully, something like that wont happen... Its not about a particular venue, but about situations... Things dont happen all of a sudden on the field, theres a build-up and then comes the explosion. Im actually fine with a bit of chit-chat as long as theres no controversy.         
	On Matthew Hayden, who too has become controversial, having been rested on Friday         
	If it was before a boxing match, it would help him! Its important to maintain composure and be calm in the dressing room.         
	[Dhoni was alluding to Hayden having challenged Ishant to a showdown in the boxing ring.]         
	Finally, speculation that Hayden had been disciplined for his unwarranted comments about Harbhajan Singh         
	This question should be thrown at Ponting.

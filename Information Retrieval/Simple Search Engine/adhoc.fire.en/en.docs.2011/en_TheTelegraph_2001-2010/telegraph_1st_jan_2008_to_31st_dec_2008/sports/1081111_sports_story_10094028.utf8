          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                     
	Nagpur: VVS Laxman, who played his 100th Test, at the VCA Stadium in Jamtha, listed his favourite performances for The Telegraph.               
	Here goes         
	Motera, November 1996: My debut Test, against South Africa... I scored 11 and 51 and am happy that I played a role in our win (by 64 runs).         
	 Sydney, January 2000: My first Test hundred (167, in the second innings), against Australia... Having been in and out of the team, the period till then had been difficult... That hundred changed everything, gave me confidence. Of course, we still lost big (innings and 141 runs).         
	 Calcutta, March 2001: My 281 in the second innings, against Australia... That Test will be remembered as a defining moment for me personally and for Indian cricket... Despite being made to follow-on, we won so handsomely (by 171 runs).         
	 Adelaide, December 2003: My 148 in the first innings, against Australia... The runs came at a critical time. Im happy that I was again able to play a role in our win (by four wickets).         
	 Mumbai, November 2004: My 69 in the second innings, against Australia... The wicket had become very difficult and theres satisfaction that I could score that many and play a part in our win (by 13 runs).         
	 Perth, January 2008: My 79 in the second innings, against Australia... Perth has a reputation for having a fast wicket and we created history... Very happy that I could play a role in another win overseas (by 72 runs).

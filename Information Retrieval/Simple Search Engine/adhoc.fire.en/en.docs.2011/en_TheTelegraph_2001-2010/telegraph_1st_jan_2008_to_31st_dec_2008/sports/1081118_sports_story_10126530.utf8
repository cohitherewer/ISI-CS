The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian women shine
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indian women shine
                      
	Dresden: Asian champion Tania Sachdev continued her superb form to beat Ketino Kachiani-Gersinka, while Mary Ann Gomes accounted for Sarah Hoolt to help the Indian womens team beat Germany 1 3-1 in the fourth round of the 32nd Chess Olympiad.         
	However, the Indian men lost narrowly to top seed Russia.         
	The 1.5-2.5 loss at the hands of the best team in the Olympiad saw the Indians slip to joint 10th spot on six points while Russia maintained a clean slate.         
	Krishnan Sasikiran did well to hold Vladimir Kramnik on the top board but the form of the Indians was found wanting on the last two boards as Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda went down against Alexander Grischuk and Alexander Morozevich respectively.         
	The Olympiad is a 11-round Swiss event and for the first time match points are used as a criterion instead of normal game points. For winning each match a team is awarded two points while in case a 2-2 result one point is awarded to both the teams.         
	The Indian men have thus far lost one and won three matches while the women have done better by drawing one and winning three matches. (PTI)

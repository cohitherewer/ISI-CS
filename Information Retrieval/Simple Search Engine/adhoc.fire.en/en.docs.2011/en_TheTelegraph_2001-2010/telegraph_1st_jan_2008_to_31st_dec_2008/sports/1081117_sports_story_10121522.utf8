The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Golfing gods were on my side: Jeev
                                                                                                                                                                                           Golfing gods were on my side: Jeev
                      
	Singapore: Indias Jeev Milkha Singh was a relieved man on Sunday after missed putts by his closest rivals Padraig Harrington and Ernie Els helped him eke out a one-stroke victory at the Singapore Open, virtually securing him the Asian Tour Order of Merit title.         
	To be honest, it still hasnt sunk in, Jeev said. I couldnt have asked for better, honestly I think I am a very fortunate man.         
	Those boys put a good effort out there... Ernie and Padraig. I think the golfing gods were on my side and I am breathing much better now.         
	Jeev and Harrington began the final round five shots behind leader Chapchai Nirat but as the Thai slid down the leaderboard, the 36-year-old Indian moved to the top on nine-under with four birdies in his opening 12 holes.         
	A bogey at 14 left Jeev level with Harrington but the Irishman double-bogeyed 16 and although the Indian bogeyed the same hole, he took the slimmest of advantages into the last.         
	I started looking at the leaderboards and knew I had a one-shot lead coming into the last. I wasnt hitting my driver that well so took a three-wood.         
	I told myself to at least confirm a five... if you make a four that would be great. I was fortunate the other guys didnt get a birdie.         
	The victory practically assures Jeev of the Asian Tour Order of Merit for a second time.         
	Winning the Order of Merit in 2006 was great and to win it again this year would be special, he added. This is the tour where I started and to top the standings again would be fantastic.         
	Complaining of fatigue earlier in the week, Jeev admitted that finding himself in the thick of a title-fight was just the fillip he needed. I was tired at the start of the week but when you get into the hunt for a title all the tiredness goes, he said.

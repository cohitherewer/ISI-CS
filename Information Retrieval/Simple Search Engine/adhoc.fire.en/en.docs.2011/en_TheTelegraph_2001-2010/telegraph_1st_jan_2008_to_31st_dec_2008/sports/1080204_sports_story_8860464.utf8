	Madrid: British Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish fans during testing at the Montmelo circuit in Barcelona, Spanish media reported on Sunday. 
    
	Reports in a number of papers said the McLaren driver was booed and insulted whenever he made his way from the team motor home and into the pits on Saturday. 
    
	The correspondent from a sports daily said that shouts of puto negro (f****** black) and negro de mierda (black s***) were clearly heard and that large sections of the crowd were involved. 
    
	It is not right the way he is being treated, McLaren test team manager Indy Lall was quoted as saying. 
    
	The paper said that the circuit director asked for fences to be put up around the McLaren paddock and ordered the removal of banners that had been put up opposite the teams base. 
    
	Another daily said the circuit director had reminded fans of their obligations at the venue. 
    
	We would like to make a plea to the fans to behave correctly, no type of offensive behaviour can be tolerated, circuit director Ramon Pradera was quoted as saying in the newspaper. 
    
	Hamilton, who finished runner-up in last years championship, has become a hate figure in Spain because of his rivalry with former McLaren teammate Fernando Alonso who is now back at Renault. 
    
	McLaren has raced and tested on Spanish circuits for many years and everyone connected with the team regards Spain and the Spanish people with great affection, Lewis included, said a McLaren spokeswoman. 
    
	Hamilton recently celebrated his 23rd birthday recently by showing off the car that McLaren hope will take him to the Formula One title as the youngest champion this season. The Briton said he was more determined and hungrier than ever.

	Perth: The decision to bat, despite packing the XI with three new-ball bowlers, couldve quickly gone horribly wrong. 
    
	By tea, though, Team India captain Anil Kumble was spotted relaxing in the visitors dressing room at the Waca. 
    
	After all, at 177 for two, he stood vindicated. But a poor decision (from Asad Rauf) and a couple of awful shots in the final session revived Australia in the third 3mobile Test. 
    
	At stumps, called well beyond the scheduled close but before 90 overs were bowled, the Indians were 297 for six. 
    
	Given the number of wickets lost, its not a very healthy score. At the same time, almost 300 on the board is an achievement for a line-up which struggled in three of the previous four innings of the series. 
    
	It couldve been a different story had India made 297 for four One would then have given a tick in the India box, acknowledged Australian spearhead Brett Lee, who was fast and furious for much of the day in demanding conditions. 
    
	Lee was the most successful (three for 64) too. 
    
	Early on, at least, Kumbles decision to bat was the talking point. Its a bold move Its a practical move given that the bounce isnt going to be any less for the team batting second, former Australia captain Mark Taylor told The Telegraph. 
    
	Kumble, of course, wouldnt have batted had there been even some moisture. That the Test here has as late as a 11.30am start took that out of the equation. 
    
	For all the hype, the Waca wicket wasnt either too quick or too bouncy. Were trying our best to bring back the life seen in the 70s and 80s, explained Waca president Dennis Lillee. 
    
	The Test marks the comeback of two Indians  Virender Sehwag, who looked good for much more than 29, and Irfan Pathan. Sehwags last appearance was a year ago, in Cape Town, while Pathans was in Bangalore last month. 
    
	After the openers gave a reasonable start, it was left to Rahul Dravid and the peerless Sachin Tendulkar to make the Australians sweat. In fact, they dominated the second session, ensuring no wicket fell. 
    
	The only other time that the batters remained unseparated in an entire session, in the ongoing series, was at the MCG on the first day. 
    
	The opening session, then, had seen Matthew Hayden and Phil Jaques hold fort with aplomb. 
    
	Incidentally, touted as the hit man, Shaun Tait was introduced as late as the 21st over and, strangely, Ricky Ponting gave him no more than 13 overs (three spells) throughout the day. 
    
	Dravid and Sachin added 139 for the third-wicket before the latter fell to Rauf. Sachin did play the wrong line to Lee, but the TV replays confirmed the Kookaburra wouldve missed the stumps. 
    
	Sourav Ganguly, whod (predictably) been greeted by a bouncer from Lee, didnt last long. His departure signalled the coming together of Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman. 
    
	After a smart partnership, both fell to shots which left fans aghast. Dravid went for 93 (his tenth dismissal in the 90s) off a top-edge, while Laxman miscued a pull. 
    
	From looking set to end Day I on a low, the Australians actually ended on quite a high. 
    
	The second new-ball has been in business for just a few overs and the overnighters  Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Pathan  are going to be tested straightaway. 
    
	But, then, Test cricket isnt for those found wanting on the character-scale.

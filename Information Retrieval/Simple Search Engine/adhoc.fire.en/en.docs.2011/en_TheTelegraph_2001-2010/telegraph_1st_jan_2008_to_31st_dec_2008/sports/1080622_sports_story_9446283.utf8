                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lata unwell, not to be present today
                  Kapil Dev                     
	New Delhi: The silver jubilee celebrations of the historic 1983 World Cup win will kick-off on Sunday with the reunion of the champion team members for a series of programmes, including a grand felicitation by the Board.         
	The celebrations will unfold in the afternoon with Vijay Mallya-owned United Breweries and Gitanjali Group organising an event where the team members will unveil an autographed bat studded with diamonds and rubies to mark Indian crickets most memorable achievement.         
	The special bat will be auctioned either in London or Mumbai and the proceeds divided equally among the players and manager P.R. Man Singh.         
	The Board will felicitate the heroes of the nation, who had grounded the mighty West Indies to clinch the coveted Cup at Lords on June 25 in 1983, later in the evening at a star-studded ceremony at a city hotel.         
	The players will receive Rs 25 lakh each in the presence of a host of dignitaries, including sports minister M. S. Gill.         
	Melody queen Lata Mangeshkar had also been invited to grace the felicitation function but the legendary playback singer would not be able to make it owing to illness.         
	Lata had helped the BCCI raise funds to honour Kapils Devils through a special concert following the teams triumph at the quadrennial extravaganza for the first and only time. Her concert in the national capital had mobilised Rs 20 lakh for the then cash-strapped BCCI and the team members were paid Rs 1 lakh each from the proceeds.         
	Pride, happiness and love of countrymen, thats what the victory gave us. Money was immaterial for us at that very moment, Kapil told a TV channel on Saturday.         
	Legendary opener Sunil Gavaskar, who was a senior member of the victorious squad, said the victory was a result of self belief. All that mattered for us was that we were world champions. The 1983 triumph gave self belief to Indian cricket, the former captain said.         
	Other invitees include all former Test captains, all Test cricketers based in Delhi, women international cricketers in Delhi, womens former and current India captains and past office bearers of the Board.         
	Besides, the presidents and secretaries of all state associations would also be present on the occasion.           (AGENCIES)

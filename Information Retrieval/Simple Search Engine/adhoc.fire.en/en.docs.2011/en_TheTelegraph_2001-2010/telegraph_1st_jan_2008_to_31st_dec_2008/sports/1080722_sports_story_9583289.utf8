The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karthik is ready for the challenge
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Karthik is ready for the challenge
    - Im excited, yes, but theres also a bit of tension, says wicketkeeper           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dinesh Karthik                                 
	Colombo: Dinesh Karthiks India debut was before Mahendra Singh Dhonis, but the latters phenomenal rise actually meant he would have to play a distant second fiddle.         
	Dhonis non-availability for the three-Test series which begins here on Wednesday has, however, paved the way for Karthiks return behind the wickets.         
	Parthiv Patel is also in the squad, but Karthik is the first-choice wicketkeeper and is set to the take the field at the Sinhalese Sports Club.         
	Talking to The Telegraph at the Taj Samudra on Monday afternoon, Karthik said: Im excited, yes, but theres also a bit of tension... After all, its going to be a comeback for me... Im ready for the challenge...         
	Karthik, incidentally, has kept in just two Tests in the last 19 months  Cape Town in January 2007 and in Bangalore (versus Pakistan) eight months ago.         
	Look, I kept in the IPL (for the Delhi DareDevils) and that helped... I would also keep for my club in Chennai... Its not that I wasnt wearing the big gloves, Karthik maintained.         
	He added: Wickets in Sri Lanka, in any case, are quite similar to those back home  particularly in Chennai.         
	Indications are that the Indians will field four specialist bowlers (Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, captain Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh) and six specialist batters  Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman.         
	For a fifth specialist bowler to be played, Karthik will have to open with Sehwag. Doesnt at all seem likely.

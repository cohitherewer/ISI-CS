The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Statistics is an ass in tennis
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Statistics is an ass in tennis
            JON GIBBS            Winners like Dinara Safina and others play smart on big points                           
	However accurate sports statistics may be generally, and in tennis specifically, they often tell less than the entire story. In many cases, they are misleading.         
	If you were told that in a particular match, player A won more points and more games and had a higher first-serve percentage, fewer unforced errors and a higher winning percentage at the net, you would deduce that player A was the winner. But leaping to that conclusion would be a mistake.         
	In tennis, it is not the events that constitute a match, but the timing of those events. In team sports like baseball, basketball and football, and even in boxing, the competitor who scores first or last may have little bearing on the outcome. In tennis, the player who scores last is always the winner.         
	In a five-set match, it is possible for a player to prevail by 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 0-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4. In the first, fourth and fifth sets, that player wins every service game at 30, but the loser takes each service game at love. In the other two sets, the loser allows no points on serve, and breaks at love three times in each of those sets. The final tally shows that the victor has won 86 points in the entire match, to the opponents 158.         
	At the US Open, the only major championship in which tie breakers are played in the fifth set, a player could win the final without achieving a service break. In the previous example, assume the fifth set was won, 7-6 (7-5). The champion would have won, not only failing to break the opponents serve, but also having been broken six times in the match. At the other Grand Slam events, with a 6-4 score in the final set, the champion would have broken once to the adversarys six breaks.         
	That leads to another possibly misleading statistic: service-break opportunities. If a player, winner or loser, converts three of 10 break-point opportunities and if those opportunities occur in only three games, something much more significant has happened.         
	A more informative statistic would be breaks achieved as a percentage of breakable games. The ability to set into context situations in which the receiver has a break chance, even if it takes two or three tries to convert a break, becomes the key, not how many chances it took. As the tennis writer and historian Steve Flink put it: The idea that a player converts only 3 of 15 break points is not enough information. If all those chances occur in three games, he gets the job done.         
	An important statistic in a singles match is the percentage of second serves won. A great number of second-serve points won can offset a lower first-serve percentage, but that is rarely stated.         
	One statistic that shows one players advantage over another is how well the player converts second-serve points. A third to a quarter of the time, players do not put the first serve in play, so a good second serve can make all the difference.         
	To win consistently, players must make sure that their aces and service winners outnumber their double faults by a large margin, and that placement winners offset unforced errors by a large margin.         
	In the final of the 1989 Open, Ivan Lendl had a higher first-serve percentage than Boris Becker (63 to 55), broke Beckers serve more often (6-5), had a better winning percentage at the net (76 to 53) and even fared better on his second-serve points (59 to 39). They were even on total points won (143), unforced errors (43) and the number of games won (21). Lendl even had more placement winners, 40-27. But Becker won, 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), in 3 hours 51 minutes.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fastest 200m of year by Bolt
                  Usain Bolt of Jamaica celebrates winning the mens 200m during the Athens Grand Prix at the Olympic Stadium in Athens on Sunday                     
	Athens: Usain Bolt, the 100-meter world record holder, ran the fastest time in the 200 this year, winning in 19.67 seconds on Sunday at the Tsiklitiria Athens Grand Prix track meet.         
	The 21-year-old Jamaican is now the fifth fastest man of all time in the 200. His time was the sixth best ever, with world record holder Michael Johnson having twice run faster.         
	I am very satisfied with my performance, Bolt said. I feel sure I will be very strong at the Olympic Games.         
	Although he started slowly, Bolt had recovered as he came out of the curve, leading comfortably in the home straight and winning by a wide margin ahead of Brendan Christian of Antigua, who was second in 20.36.         
	Bolt ran 9.72 to set the 100 world record in New York in May. He didnt run the 100 in Athens.         
	He has previously said he is unsure whether he will compete in both the 100 and 200 at the Beijing Olympics next month.         
	Asked if he would be going for the 200-metre world record of 19.32, which Johnson set in August 1996, Bolt said not yet.         
	Not this year, maybe next, he said.         
	The Jamaican also had the previous best time of the year in the 200, running 19.83 in June in Ostrava, Czech Republic, while Sundays time beat his personal best of 19.75, set last year.         
	In the 100, Derrick Atkins of the Bahamas won in 10.10, finishing ahead of Darvis Patton and Mark Jelks of the US.         
	This is my second win in a row here in Athens and I am very proud, Atkins said.         
	Atkins, runner-up at last years World Championships, surged in the second half of the race to win easily. Fearing disqualification after a false start, the sprinters were slow getting out of the blocks and ran into a slight head wind.         
	(I was) tired after strong races at the US champs, Patton said. My next race will be in London. In Beijing, I want to win a medal.         
	In the 110 hurdles, world record holder Dayron Robles set a meet record by winning in 13.04 seconds.         
	Getting the Olympic gold medal is the most important thing to me, because its something you can only do every four years, the Cuban said. I know Liu (Xiang) will be difficult to beat. The people love him in China and hes a good person.         
	Robles ran a 12.87 last month, bettering Lius previous mark of 12.89.         
	Olympic champion Stefan Holm of Sweden won the high jump with a world-best leap this year of 2.37 meters.         
	I always jump well in Greece, Holm said. I hope I will be strong in Beijing, too.         
	In the 3000-meter steeplechase, world record holder Saif Saaeed Shaheen dropped out near the halfway mark. Olympic champion Ezekiel Kemboi won in 8:9.26, the third best in the world this year. Sanya Richards of the US won the womens 400 comfortably in 49.86 seconds.         
	I was very strong, she said. I did not face any problems. I aim for the Olympic gold.         
	In the womens 100, Veronica Campbell of Jamaica won in 10.92 to equal the meet record set in 1999. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eager to bowl against Sachin, says Warne
                                                     Eager to bowl against Sachin, says Warne
                  Shane Warne                     
	Mumbai: Leg-spin legend Shane Warne, who has been named the captain-cum-coach of the Jaipur side  the Rajasthan Royals  in the Indian Premier League (IPL), on Wednesday demanded that the six-week IPL period be kept free of international cricket by the ICC.         
	It will remain the number one priority for every cricketer to play for his country. Thats why I want the ICC to change its Future Tours Programme and ensure that when the IPL is held theres no international cricket.         
	All the international players must be available to play in the IPL, the retired Australian leg-spin great said from Perth during a teleconference.         
	IPL is a great concept and twenty20 cricket is very exciting. We (players) are all thankful to India for this concept, said Warne.         
	Warne said he was also eager to work with his compatriot Greg Chappell, the former India coach, who is connected with the cricket academy of the Rajasthan Cricket Association in Jaipur.         
	I am eager to work with Greg. I have learned a hell of a lot from him. Hes a great person to talk about cricket. The best coach I have worked under is Bob Simpson, said the former Australian cricketer.         
	I am retired (from international cricket) for a year and am really excited about it (IPL), said Warne.         
	The champion bowler was also wholesome in praising Sachin Tendulkar, who is expected to lead the Mumbai franchise.         
	The best player in my time has been Sachin. He has given me nightmares. Sachin is one of my great friends and a lovely guy. I look forward to bowling against him in the IPL, he said.         
	The retired leg-spinner, who plays for Hampshire, said he was pretty thrilled and looked forward to taking part in the 44-day, 59-match IPL which pits eight Indian city-based franchises against one another.         
	I am really excited in representing the Jaipur franchise and am bringing to the table the experience of having played international cricket for 20 years and the experience of having been the cricketer who has been part of a winning team for the most number of times, Warne said.         
	I also bring to the table my communication skill and want to help my team, which has some exciting players like Graeme Smith (South Africa), Younis Khan (Pakistan) and Mohammed Kaif (India), said the bowler who was named as one of the top five cricketers of the 20th century.         
	 I have always enjoyed coming to India. Cricket is a great passion. It took me time to learn to bowling in Indian conditions and wickets.         
	Michael Clarke (left-arm part-time spin) took six for nine at Mumbai (in the final Test of that series lost by Australia). Had I played (he was injured) I too would have been among the wickets, he said.         
	Another report from Chennai adds that Keppler Wessels, the lone international cricketer who has played for two countries, has been roped in to coach India Cements Chennai Super Kings for a one-year term.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Milan draw at Portsmouth

	Manchester: AC Milan took until stoppage time to salvage a draw at unfashionable Portsmouth in the Uefa Cup on Thursday as the Italians missed a chance to join Manchester City, CSKA Moscow and St Etienne in qualifying for knockout phase.         
	Filippo Inzaghi scored the equaliser in the second minute of injury time after Ronaldinho fired in a 30-metre free kick as seven-time European champion AC Milan hit back from two goals down to deny the Premier League side a famous victory.         
	CSKA  winners in 2005  beat Lech Poznan 2-1, Manchester City won 2-0 at Schalke, and St Etienne progressed to the last 32 with a 1-1 draw at Club Brugge.         
	Tottenham look on track to join them after defeating NEC Nijmegen 1-0, with the top three teams in each group qualifying for the next round.         
	But Feyenoord, who won the competition in 2002, saw their campaign end with a 3-0 loss at Deportivo La Coruna, and Standard Liege dumped out Partizan Belgrade with a 1-0 victory to go top of Group C.         
	Also in Group C, Sampdoria were held 1-1 by Stuttgart.         
	At Fratton Park, second half strikes by Younes Kaboul and Nwankwo Kanu appeared to have put FA Cup winners Portsmouth on the way to a famous victory over star-studded Milan in Group E.         
	But Ronaldinho, who came on with his team losing 2-0 with 16 minutes to go, won a disputed free kick after being fouled by Glen Johnson and then curved a trademark effort in.         
	Inzaghi, who earlier hit the post and the bar, collected a lobbed pass from Zambrotta, controlled it first time and prodded the ball home for the equaliser with just seconds in the game remaining. Milan remain unbeaten with seven points from three games to top the group.         
	Zvjezdan Misimovic scored twice for second-placed Wolfsburg in the last seven minutes  his second goal deep into injury time  to stun Braga 3-2.         
	Manchester City showed that the Premier League side dont need Robinho to win matches, comfortably defeating Schalke with the Brazil forward out with an ankle injury. Robinhos place was taken by Daniel Sturridge, who provided the cross that Benjani Mwaruwari slotted into an open goal at the far post in the 32nd minute.         
	Stephen Ireland slotted the ball under the advancing Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer in the 66th. (AP)

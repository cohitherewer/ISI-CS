                                                   Fresh tussle in Pakistan camp

           
	Karachi: Relations between Pakistans national selectors and team management appear to have soured after a clash on Tuesday during a practice session at the National Stadium here. 
    
	Sources privy to the ongoing cold war between selectors and the team management said coach Geoff Lawson and captain Shoaib Malik exchanged some sarcastic remarks with senior selector Shafqat Rana after the team net session. 
    
	Lawson and Malik are reported to be unhappy with some of the decisions being enforced on them by the selectors, one such being over the selection of debutant opener Nasir Jamshed for the first one-dayer against Zimbabwe held on Monday. 
    
	Sources said the selectors wanted Jamshed to play while the coach and captain wanted wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal to open with Salman Butt. 
    
	Jamshed eventually went on to score 61 runs to win the Man of the Match award. 
    
	Lawson and chief selector Salahudddin Ahmed also had an argument over Jamshed in Lahore during the camp at the weekend. 
    
	Malik had made his point clear at a news conference earlier that he would prefer newcomers who have played three to four years of domestic cricket. 
    
	The captain said he wanted Akmal and Butt to open in one-day Internationals while the selectors search for new openers for Test matches. (PTI)

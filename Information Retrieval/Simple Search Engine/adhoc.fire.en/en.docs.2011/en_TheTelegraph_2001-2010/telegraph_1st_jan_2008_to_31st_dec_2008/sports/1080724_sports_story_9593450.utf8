The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Just 22 overs possible on rain-hit day
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Just 22 overs possible on rain-hit day

	Colombo: With the elements dominating, neither team was exactly pressed for ideas at the Sinhalese Sports Club on Wednesday, opening day of the three-Test series for the Idea Cup.         
	The script could, of course, change dramatically if the Team India bowlers quickly add to the two wickets already taken. At stumps, after just 22 overs (all after tea), the hosts were 85 for two.         
	Day II is scheduled to begin half-an-hour early, at 9.45 am, but theres no guarantee that the first ball will be bowled on the dot.         
	July and August are the months when it pours in these parts, yet its common for a bilateral series or a tournament to be scheduled over the two months.         
	Perhaps, Sri Lanka Cricket doesnt have a choice. But, then, whats the International Cricket Council doing?         
	Getting back to the days very limited play, a poor shot from Michael Vandort and an excellent catch from Rahul Dravid were the highlights.         
	Opener Vandort chased an away-going delivery from Ishant Sharma, which bounced awkwardly, and paid the price. The need of the hour, after Mahela Jayawardene won the toss, had been to stay put in conditions conducive for the new-ball bowlers.         
	Big runs on the board are needed if the Indians, with a fantastic line-up, are to be challenged. For that, the start has to be statement-making.         
	Vandort, clearly, should learn from partner Malinda Warnapura  nephew of Sri Lankas first Test captain, Bandula Warnapura.         
	The home teams best batsman, vice-captain Kumar Sangakkara, was the other one who got out. After adding exactly 50 for the second-wicket, he fell to a superbly taken low catch by Dravid, at first slip.         
	Sangakkaras wicket went to Zaheer Khan, playing his first Test of the year. He couldnt have hoped for a bigger comeback making scalp.         
	Unbeaten at stumps were Warnapura on a solid 50 and Jayawardene on 16. The latter has the chance to play a captains innings and deny India a headstart.         
	Sourav Ganguly, by the way, was brought into the attack as early as the 12th over. It was a conditions-influenced move from Anil Kumble.         
	Its not unusual for me to bowl so early... Also, dont forget Im a genuine allrounder, Sourav quipped, when asked by The Telegraph to clarify the category under which he makes the XI.         
	There were, by the way, no more than a handful of spectators. The growing interest in the Twenty20 game could be one reason for such a turnout. But, surely, it cant also help when matches are slotted during the monsoon.

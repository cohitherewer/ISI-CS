The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo to confront Ferguson
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ronaldo to confront Ferguson

	Manchester United are preparing to welcome Cristiano Ronaldo back to the clubs Carrington training ground next Tuesday, despite renewed speculation in Spain that the Portuguese forward remains determined to force through a transfer to Real Madrid.         
	Having undergone ankle surgery in Amsterdam on July 7, Ronaldo is due back in Holland on Monday to have his recovery assessed by surgeon Niek van Dijk.         
	It is anticipated that Ronaldo will then fly to Manchester ahead of his return to United for the first time since helping the club win the European Cup on May 21.         
	Reports in Spain on Thursday, however, suggested that Ronaldo has informed Real Madrid, via his agent Jorge Mendes, that he will confront Sir Alex Ferguson, who he met for face-to-face talks in Lisbon last month, with his intention to leave United.         
	Old Trafford officials have developed an air of indifference to the mischief-making coming from the Spanish capital and view the daily bulletins as little more than desperation on the part of Real to chip away at Uniteds resolve not to sell.

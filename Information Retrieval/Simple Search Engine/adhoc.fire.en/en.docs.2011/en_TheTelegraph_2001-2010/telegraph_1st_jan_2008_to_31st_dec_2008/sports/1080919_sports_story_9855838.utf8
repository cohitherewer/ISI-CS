The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It will be tough for India on clay
                                                                                                                                                                                                     It will be tough for India on clay
  - Amritraj to take on Crivoi in opening rubber Dev Varman faces Hanescu                       
	Bucharest: Prakash Amritraj will take on Victor Crivoi in the opening rubber while in-form Somdev Dev Varman will face Romanian No.1 Victor Hanescu in the crucial World Group play-off tie starting here on Friday.         
	With Prakash struggling, young Somdev will have to shoulder a big responsibility and win both his matches, while the Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi pair will have to live up to their reputation against Adrian Cruciat and Horia Tecau in the doubles, if India are to book a place in the World Group.         
	If Somdev, who has shown exceptionally good form in the last three months, wins the rubber against Hanescu, India could be in for a great chance because he will play lower-ranked Victor Crivoi in the reverse singles, while Prakash will be up against Hanescu.         
	India had defeated Japan in the Asia/Oceania Group semi-finals to earn the right to play the World Group play-off, while Romania lost to France in the first round of the World Group to drop to play-offs.         
	India last played in the World Group in 1998 when they lost to Italy 1-4 on clay in the away tie.         
	This is the fourth meeting between India and Romania with the hosts leading 2-1, having won the last two encounters in 1969 and 1971. Indias only victory against Romania came in 1922.         
	The visitors dropped Rohan Bopanna from the team to include Somdev and have a non-playing captain in S. P. Mishra as Leander decided to step down as the captain after the Beijing Olympics. This happened after Mahesh, Prakash and Bopanna revolted against Leander by questioning his leadership qualities ahead of the Japan tie in April.         
	Indians have a dominating game on grasscourt, but this crucial tie is being played on claycourt and Romanians, led by world No.67 Victor Hanescu, surely hold the advantage.         
	The hosts have made two changes to their side, bringing in Cruciat (ranked 170) and Crivoi (158) in place of Andrei Pavel and Florin Mergea. Horia Tecau is the fourth member of the team with Florin Segarceanu as the non-playing captain.         
	Prakash is yet to play a claycourt match in the Davis Cup. Somdev will play only his second Davis Cup tie. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Exciting game in the offing
                                                                                                                                                                                             Exciting game in the offing
            A STAFF REPORTER            Yusif Yakubu at practice   on Monday                                 
	Calcutta: Spectators can expect an attacking game of football when East Bengal take on Mumbai FC on Tuesday at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	East Bengal had looked menacing in the first half of their 3-1 demolition of United SC, while Mumbai FC were classy going forward against much fancied Mohun Bagan in their 2-1 win.         
	Stanley Rozario, East Bengals AFC Pro license holder coach and David Booth, the astute Englishman at the helm of the Mumbai-based side, both prefer free flowing football, focusing on movements both on and off the ball.         
	Booth had told his side to attack whenever they could against Bagan, while readily falling back to keep their defensive shape when pressed.         
	Stanley too believes in a similar philosophy  players frequently changing positions, making darting runs higher up the pitch  it was all evident in those first 45 minutes of sublime brilliance against Subrata Bhattacharjees side.         
	Scoring shouldnt be a problem for either side with quality marksmen present in both ranks. For East Bengal, Yakubu will be looking to play a similar role as he did in the first match, operating just behind Edmilson Marquez and Sunil Chhetri.         
	Chhetri though is a doubtful starter after taking a knock in Mondays practice. If the Delhi boy fails to make it to the starting line up, Ashim Biswas will be a more than able replacement. Edmilson who didnt get on to the score sheet against United SC will be looking to get his tally up and running. Surkumar Singh is also doubtful due to an injury.         
	The two classy foreigners Abel Hammond and Felix Aboage will be looking to share the striking duties for Mumbai FC. The midfield battle will also be one to watch out for with Kulothungan fighting it out with Mehrajuddin Wadoo and Co.         
	The match was shifted from the Barasat stadium to Salt Lake after, East Bengal complained about unplayable, muddy conditions at Barasat.

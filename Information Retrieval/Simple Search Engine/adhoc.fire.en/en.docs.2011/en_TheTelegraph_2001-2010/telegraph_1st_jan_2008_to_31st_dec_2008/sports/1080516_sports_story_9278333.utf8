The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Riders may field all-pace attack
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Riders may field all-pace attack
                      
	The Kolkata Knight Riders think tank is considering fielding an all-pace attack in the crucial IPL match against the Mumbai Indians on Friday.         
	Its almost certain that Ajit Agarkar, who is a Mumbaikar and knows conditions at the Wankhede very well, will replace spinner Iqbal Abdullah, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Shoaib Akhtar, Ishant Sharma and Ashok Dinda were the specialist quicks/mediumpacers who did duty in the last match, against the Delhi DareDevils, at the Eden on Tuesday.         
	That the Wankhede wicket had pace and bounce during Wednesdays match between the home team and the Chennai Super Kings has made the Knight Riders strongly look at changing the bowling combination.         
	According to the source, there could be one other change as well: Mohammed Hafeez, who can bowl off-breaks, could well replace Tatenda Taibu.         
	Both teams have recovered from setbacks and are on a roll. Whoever wins at the Wankhede will be taking a significant step towards a last-four berth.         
	The first-leg match, at the Eden, had been won by the Mumbai Indians.           LPS

	Madrid: A commanding performance by a player having a commanding year ended Americas reign as Davis Cup holder on Sunday, and sent Spain into the final against Argentina.         
	Buoyed by the cheers of a home crowd in a bullring, Rafael Nadal played the role of accomplished matador to the fullest, defeating Andy Roddick 6-4, 6-0, 6-4 to place Spain in its sixth final.         
	Spain will play for the title in November against Argentina, which defeated Russia 3-2 in the semi-final in Buenos Aires. Juan Martin del Potro beat Igor Andreev in straight sets in the deciding match.         
	Nadal said he nearly didnt play on Sunday because an MRI scan a day earlier showed a strained buttock muscle.                 
	In the finale before 20,000 fans at Las Ventas arena, Feliciano Lopez defeated Sam Querrey 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-4) to complete a 4-1 victory.         
	Del Potro, who turns 20 on Tuesday, defeated Andreev 6-4, 6-2, 6-1 to complete Argentinas 3-2 win and secure a third berth in the final, and first at home.         
	Argentina lost its two previous finals to Russia in 2006 and to the US in 1981.         
	Russias Nikolay Davydenko beat fellow top-10 player David Nalbandian 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2), 6-0 to force the tie to the fifth rubber.         
	At one point, Del Potro won nine games in a row to lead by two sets and 4-0. He broke Andreev a sixth time for the victory.         
	Having won 25 of his last 26 matches, including four ATP titles, Del Potro could have been beaten only outside Argentina, quipped Russia captain Shamil Tarpischev.           (AP)

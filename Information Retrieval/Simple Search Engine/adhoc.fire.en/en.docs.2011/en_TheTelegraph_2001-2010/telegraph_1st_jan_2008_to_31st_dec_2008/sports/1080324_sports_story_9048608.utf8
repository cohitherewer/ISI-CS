The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beckham deserves to lead in 100th match, says Terry
                                                   Beckham deserves to lead in 100th match, says Terry
                      
	London: John Terry believes David Beckham should be captain if he earns his 100th international appearance for England in a friendly at France on Wednesday.         
	Terry was appointed England captain when Beckham stepped down from the position after the 2006 World Cup. New England coach Fabio Capello has not publicly decided if Terry will continue in the role. Terry missed Capellos first game in charge, a 2-1 friendly win over Switzerland on February 6, with injury, while Beckham wasnt selected because of fitness reasons.         
	David is a credit to himself and what he has done is exceptional, Terry told BBC Radio on Sunday. If he is going to start or come on, he fully deserves to wear that England armband.         
	Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paul Robinson, meanwhile, has been restored to the 23-member England squad byCapello for the friendly with France in Paris on Wednesday, while Beckham has retained his place with the 32-year-old in line to win his 100th cap.         
	ENGLANDS REVISED SQUAD  Goalkeepers: David James, Paul Robinson, Chris Kirkland. Defenders: Wayne Bridge, Wes Brown, Ashley Cole, Rio Ferdinand, Glen Johnson, Joleon Lescott, John Terry, Jonathan Woodgate.

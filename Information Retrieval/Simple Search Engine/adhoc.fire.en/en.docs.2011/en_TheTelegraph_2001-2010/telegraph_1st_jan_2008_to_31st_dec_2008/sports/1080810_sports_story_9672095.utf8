The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pete will breathe easy now: John 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pete will breathe easy now: John 
                      
	Los Angeles: John McEnroe says Pete Sampras is surely breathing a sigh of relief with Roger Federers impending drop from the world No.1 spot after four and a half years of domination.         
	Im sure Pete is sleeping a bit better than he was nine months ago, the American tennis icon said during a senior tour stop at Los Angeles. It was looking for a while that Federer would blow through the (alltime) record of 14 (Grand Slam titles when the Swiss hit his 12th last year at the US open).         
	McEnroe added that his onetime rival Sampras would have good chances had he been able to play either Federer or Wimbledon and French Open champion Rafael Nadal at his prime.         
	Federer, trying to revitalise his season at the Beijing Olympics from this weekend, will lose his ranking to a week from Monday, dropping to second behind Nadal.         
	The Swiss, who turned 27 on Friday on the same day he carried the flag for his nation in the Olympic opening ceremony, will be trying to come good in Beijing and the US Open after failing to win a major in nearly a year.         
	It doesnt get any easier, said 49-year-old McEnroe, playing this week at the seniors in LA with others including Jim Courier. I think Pete won the majority of his slams at age 27 or below.         
	Mcenroe said he fully believes that Nadal has earned his impending No. 1 status.         
	You think it will never change for Roger, but the law of averages catches up. Nadal has improved, his ranking is wellearned. He did something (French and Wimbledon titles in the same season) that had not been done since 1980 (Bjorn Borg).

  - Ghar ka khana in captains suite is part of build-up       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                    With another big match at the SCG, the focus will once again be on Harbhajan and Symonds                                 
	Sydney: It wasnt a formal team lunch on Saturday, but quite a few descended on Mahendra Singh Dhonis suite at the Radisson Plaza once word got around that a well-wisher had brought ghar ka khana.         
	On a long tour, thats no less than manna from heaven.         
	While the captain took a chair, Suresh Raina, Piyush Chawla, Rohit Sharma and Praveen Kumar didnt mind sitting on the floor and tucking into the parathas, aloo subzi, raita and absolutely delicious samosas.         
	As he had a guest, Irfan Pathan chose to take the food over to his room.         
	Its only when Robin Uthappa turned up that the idlis started disappearing, prompting Dhoni to joke that the choice of his teammates reflected the region they came from.         
	The ghar ka khana didnt take long to be consumed and the camaraderie in Dhonis suite confirmed that the youngsters bond strongly and would probably do anything for Indias ODI (and Twenty20) captain.         
	As for Dhoni, he doesnt believe in a free lunch and, so, is bound to make his demand on the field of play.         
	That half-an-hour also showed the players relaxed state of mind in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Bank-sponsored tri-series final No.1, at the SCG.         
	The Indians havent won a tournament for almost five years (the TVS Cup in Dhaka, shared with South Africa, was the last in April 2003) and its widely believed that Dhoni and Co. have an excellent chance against the hosts, who arent invincible any more.         
	The finals is a best-of-three affair. The Indians, by the way, have never been the best in a tri-series in Australia.         
	The Australians are the world champions (and have been so from 1999), yes, but theyve been out of sorts in the tri-series and nobody has been able to fathom Fridays collapse and subsequent defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka.         
	Conditions at the MCG were tough... They were different from what will be on offer at the SCG and, so, theres no point going into what happened there, maintained Michael Hussey, not very convincingly mind you.         
	Matthew Hayden will be back after being rested/disciplined, but its to be seen just how big a factor his presence will be after that obnoxious little weed nonsense directed at Harbhajan Singh.         
	Dhoni has gone on record saying he doesnt mind a bit of chit-chat, but with Andrew Symonds and Harbhajan again locking horns and Ricky Ponting and Ishant Sharma ready to join the adults-only party, one hopes non-cricket issues wont derail Australias last scheduled tri-series.         
	The Indians have a worry at the top of the order, but Dhoni is likely to continue opening with Sachin Tendulkar and Uthappa. The solidity, clearly, has come from the in-form No.3  Gautam Gambhir.         
	Virender Sehwag suddenly came in the frame, late on Saturday, but indications are that even if he plays (with Munaf Patel sitting out), he wont open.         
	Dhoni and acting coach Lalchand Rajput could eventually retain the XI which beat Sri Lanka in Hobart. Or, at most, play a second specialist spinner (Chawla) with Munaf demoted to drinks duty.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, both Dhoni and Rajput are in favour of continuing with five bowlers (including allrounder Irfan Pathan) as they fear big trouble if just four are played and the Australians target one of them.         
	At the same time, because its the first final, the temptation to strengthen the batting is there. The captain and acting coach wont, therefore, have a comfortable sleep.         
	Too many things are going on in the mind, accepted Dhoni, wholl be looking to set a target, assuming hes in a position to do so.         
	The SCG will, of course, be packed to capacity. For one, its an India match on a Sunday and, then, its going to be Adam Gilchrists farewell appearance here.         
	Whatever else, be it in the Members stand or the corporate boxes, emotions wont be in short supply.         
	TEAMS         
	India (likely): Sachin Tendulkar, Robin Uthappa, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Irfan Pathan, Praveen Kumar, Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Munaf Patel/Piyush Chawla.         
	Australia (likely): Matthew Hayden, Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Michael Hussey, Andrew Symonds, James Hopes, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Bracken.         
	Umpires: Rudi Koertzen, Daryl Harper; TV: Bruce Oxenford.         
	Match Referee: Jeff Crowe.         
	Match starts: 8.45am (IST).

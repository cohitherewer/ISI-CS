                                                                                                                                                                                                       Well keep growing, just like our fans: Shah Rukh
    - Bollywood megastar to set up Knight Riders office in city           A STAFF REPORTER            Kolkata Knight Riders Shoaib Akhtar and Sourav Ganguly with owner Shah Rukh Khan at a Calcutta hotel on Sunday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                 
	Calcutta: Shah Rukh Khan has reconfirmed his association with the Kolkata Knight Riders. As a first step, he would set up an office in the city soon.         
	At a function in the afternoon to mark the end of their campaign, Shah Rukh Khan thanked everyone and presented the players and support staff with gold plated helmets.         
	Shah Rukh brushed aside all controversies of discontent within the team, saying, when somebody is down or losing doesnt necessarily mean there are problems within the team. Ive been working for 21 years. Ive seen amazing highs and awful lows But one thing is that Ive always stood by the ideology. Ive always stuck to my passion and belief, he said.         
	These are all baseless reports published in a section of the media. There is no bad blood in the team. Im very hurt by these allegations. We are all good friends. Sourav is an important player of my team So are the others, he said.         
	Formally attired, and not in his trademark Knight Riders jersey, Shah Rukh spent some time at the Eden, during which he handed over the team jersey to debutant Ajanta Mendis. He left before the start and took a late evening flight out of the city.         
	Not all of my films have done well. I have done close to 60 and more than half of them havent done well. The reason Ive achieved success is because I know failures well Im attached to failure Life itself is a failure because you die at the end of it. I dont lose to failure. When I started making films and producing them people said I would be a failure. Thankfully, most of the things Ive embarked upon havent failed         
	Shah Rukh also said that they would be wiser by the experience. There have been lot of slip ups. Weve learnt from mistakes. We also keep growing just like our little fans The first step towards having a better management would be to set up an office for Knight Riders in Calcutta. We would then have the local flavour going I would be visiting and looking up things here. That would ensure we remain part of the family and culture assuming that we keep our association going for another 30-40 years.         
	While not willing to divulge plans for next season, he made it clear that he was already working on it. It would be strange to discuss my plans for next season. The target obviously would be to play better and win the trophy. There are lots of plans The people have shown tremendous faith in us and weve got to carry it forward with gusto.         
	Cricket-wise the best judge would be John (Buchanan) and Sourav (Ganguly). My job is to support the team. We would be looking at new recruits in the new season We will also have to look at our agenda. Well also our get our regulars like (Ricky) Ponting and (Brendon) McCullum back. We will meet shortly and decide on the course of action, he said.         
	There was not much choice with team selection. The bidding process was such that the cap was on $5 million. Everybody didnt get the team of his choice but thats the way it is There are lot of rules and issues that need to be sorted out. It was more of a mathematical selection.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nepal keen to prove a point
                                                Nepal keen to prove a point
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Nepal face Australia, the two-time champions, and Sri Lanka in an intriguing group C of the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Penang.         
	Nepal have upset five full members in the last three Under-19 World Cups and finished ninth at the 2006 edition, ahead of New Zealand and South Africa, who were both defeated by the minnows.         
	In contrast, Australia, winners in 1988 and 2002, had a disappointing sign off to their 2006 campaign when they crashed to a heavy 163-run defeat against eventual winners Pakistan in the semi-finals.         
	Sri Lanka were also left licking their wounds in their backyard two years ago when they lost to Bangladesh by 98 runs in the fifth-place play-off final.         
	With two places up for grabs in the Super League from a group that also includes Namibia, the second game will be crucial as Nepal will face Sri Lanka at the Penang Sports Club on February 18, according to a media release.         
	Coached by former Sri Lanka opener Roy Dias, Nepal qualified for the tournament from the Asia region after finishing unbeaten in the 10-team tournament in Kuala Lumpur.

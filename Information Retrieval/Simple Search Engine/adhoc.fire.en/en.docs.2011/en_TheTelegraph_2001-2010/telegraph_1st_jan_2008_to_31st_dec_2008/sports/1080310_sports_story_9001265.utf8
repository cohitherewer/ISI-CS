                                                   Hope to do well vs SA: Dhoni
                      
	Ranchi: Buoyed by the historic tri-series win in Australia, Team India ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Sunday was confident of a good show against the visiting South Africans.         
	I dont predict much. We want to ensure good cricket. Usually, we play better at home and Im expecting a good result, he said.         
	South Africa will play three Test matches against India later this month and in April.         
	On Sachin Tendulkars injury, Dhoni said: Well, when its a player of the calibre of Sachin, naturally it is worrisome.         
	Pointing out that the threat of injuries would always be there at the international level, the wicketkeeper batsman said: injury is part and parcel of cricket.         
	On whether playing continuously is resulting in injuries, Dhoni said, We are fortunate because the weather (in India) allows us to play round the year. We dont have such extreme conditions, say six months of snowing and all that. But if any one wants to take rest, he can.         
	On whether there would be a spill over of racism controversy in the forthcoming IPL as 12 Australian players were scheduled to play, he said its not a great thing. Once IPL starts, everything will be sorted out.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand in joint lead
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Anand in joint lead
                      
	Mainz: World champion Viswanathan Anand ended the opening day of the Mainz Chess Classic on a positive note defeating Russian Alexander Morozevich to emerge as the joint leader in the Grenkeleasing Rapid World Championship.         
	The 10-time winner Anand could do little with his white pieces against Norwegian sensation Magnus Carlsen and worlds strongest ever woman player Judit Polgar of Hungary and settled for draws in the first two rounds while his victory as black against Morozevich raised visions of the 11th title victory for the Indian ace.         
	The four-player double-robin event will see best two fighting it out for the title. The games are being played on a rapid chess format with 20 minutes to each player and a 5 second increment after every move is made.         
	The victory in the third round came in handy for Anand as he took his personal tally to 2 points out of a possible 3 to share the lead with Carlsen whose victory came over an out of sort Judit Polgar who could just manage a half point in the first three rounds.

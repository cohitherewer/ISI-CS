	Canberra: Team India middle order batsman Yuvraj Singh, after failing in successive Test matches, found moral and technical support from maestro Sachin Tendulkar who spent quite a while at nets with the left-hander on Wednesday.
 
	With captain Anil Kumble opting out, his deputy Mahendra Singh Dhoni will lead the side in the three-day warm-up match against the Australian Capital Territory XI, starting at the Manuka Oval on Thursday. 
 
	Speaking to the reporters on Wednesday, Kumble said he hoped the practice tie would give his struggling batsmen a good opportunity to strike form. 
 
	We have been in Australia for about three weeks and some guys still havent had a hit in the middle hellip; Its important we get the best out of this game, Kumble said when asked about Yuvrajs form. 
 
	We really need to buck up hellip; Its important for us that whoever has not been among runs gets some runs here. This is a good opportunity. Were actually away from a real pressure situation. Canberra will provide the right kind of environment where you can relax and focus on the game, the leg-spinner pointed out. 
 
	We need to be on top of our game to beat Australia. We have done that in patches in the series. There have been occasions when we had chances to be on top; We had a chance to draw the last game also (in Sydney) hellip; I am hopeful the guys will grab the opportunity here before the start of the third Test, Kumble added. 
 
	Having stayed put in Sydney for a couple of days, India reached Canberra on Wednesday morning. 
 
	The Indians had nets for about a couple of hours after reaching the Australian capital. 
 
	There was however a twist to the drama when Kumble amp; Co. left Sydney. According to reports, the team bus grazed past a Mercedes Benz while leaving the Radisson Hotel. The Indian team management, however, denied that any such incident took place. 
 
	It has been learnt that Virender Sehwag, Dinesh Karthik, Irfan Pathan, Pankaj Singh and V.R.V. Singh will get a chance in the warm-up match. In that case, senior pros Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly may also skip the match. 
 
	We are yet to think about the composition, but it will not be full strength. Theres a possibility that it will be a 12-member team where 11 can play but somebody may bat on a bowlers behalf, Kumble said. 
 
	The hosts will be led by Mark Higgs. 
 
	According to another report, the Indians had thought about wearing black armbands as a mark of protest in the warm-up match, but later abandoned the idea.

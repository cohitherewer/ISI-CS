            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A mistake snowballed into a controversy on Friday in the U-22 CK Nayudu Trophy match between Bengal and Tripura in Agartala.         
	When Bengals Ashrafuddin came on to bowl, Tripura objected saying he was not in the side when the visitors batted. Bengal insisted he was there and his name was wrongly entered as Bunty Goala. Play was held up for a while. Tripura, however, did not lodge a complaint.         
	CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra said: It was a mistake. The players name was wrongly recorded as Bunty Goala. Ashrafuddin is playing the match.         
	Changes to squad         
	Three changes were made to the Bengal squad for their Ranji Trophy Plate group tie against Services at the Eden from Sunday. Sourav Sarkar, Dibyendu Chakraborty and Sourav Sarkar were included, while Shib Shankar Paul, Arindam Ghosh and Priyankar Mukherjee were left out. Iresh Saxena is also unfit and the fitness report is awaited.         
	The Squad: Laxmi Ratan Shukla (captain), Anustup Majumdar, Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha, Sohom Ghosh, Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda, Avik Chowdhury, Ritam Kundu, Sourav Sarkar, Rohan Banerjee, Sreevats Goswami, Iresh Saxena, Dibyendu Chakraborty.

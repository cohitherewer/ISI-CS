            A STAFF REPORTER            Sankar Oraon (left) of United SC vies for the ball with Mumbai FCs Anas Edathodika at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: United SC deserved three points but got only one as Mumbai FC held them to a 1-1 draw at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Friday.         
	United SC are currently in the relegation zone with nine points from nine matches and Fridays draw wont help their cause. This was Mumbai FCs fourth draw on the trot and they too are not in a comfortable position but as their coach David Booth admitted, they were lucky to have escaped with a draw.         
	United were in business right from the word go. Although the first shot on goal shot came from Mumbai FC, it was United who were making all the right moves.         
	They looked like scoring any moment and finally did it in the 12th minute.         
	Denson Devadas unleashed a brilliant right-footer from 30 yards out. Mumbai FC goalkeeper Kalyan Chaubey tried his best to fist it out. But he ended up palming it away. Sankar Oraon rushed into the box from the left and tapped the ball in.         
	The half that started with a lot of promise became an exhibition of mediocrity after the goal.         
	Though United held sway in the midfield, forwards Sankar and Murithala Ali were not up to the task. Mumbai FC found it hard to get the ball but United could do little with better ball possession.         
	The second half was more eventful. The half started with a Murithala shot on goal which did not ask too many questions of the Mumbai FC custodian.         
	But six minutes later, Chaubey was all at sea when Sankar got away from the Mumbai FC defenders and only had the goalkeeper to beat. A desperate Chaubey pulled Sankar down.         
	Everybody thought that was a penalty but referee Shaji Kurian directed Sankar to get up quickly. Even the Mumbai FC players had stopped in anticipation of a penalty.         
	To their credit, United players, instead of grumbling about the decision, regrouped quickly and mounted another attack in the very next minute.         
	Man of the Match Snehasish Chakraborty ran down the right of the Mumbai FC box and his centre was perfect for Sankar. But he ended up shooting the ball well over the bar.         
	That proved to be a costly miss. Unable to get a clear shot on goal, Riston Rodrigues had a go from just outside the box. Bidemi, who was standing in the way, was the unlucky man whose forehead changed the direction of the ball as United goalie Gopal Das helplessly watched it go in.         
	One has to be more than lucky to get a goal like this. This evening that privileged player was Rodrigues.         
	United did create chances towards the end of the match but poor finishing denied them a deserving victory.

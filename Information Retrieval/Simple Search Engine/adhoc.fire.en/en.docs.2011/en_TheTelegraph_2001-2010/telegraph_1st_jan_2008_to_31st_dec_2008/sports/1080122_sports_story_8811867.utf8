                                                      Sachin humbled by fans response

   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
        Sachin Tendulkar 
   
	Adelaide: There were shrieks of Sachin, Sachin both at the Perth airport and on Team Indias arrival here, on Monday evening.
 
	If thats par for the course each time Sachin Tendulkar becomes visible, theres been nothing very unusual in the manner crowds have greeted him every time that hes left the dressing room to take guard.
 
	The reception, perhaps, could be more emotional in Adelaide mdash; the late Sir Donald Bradmans home turf.
 
	Sir Don, after all, made his admiration for Sachin very clear some five years before he died, in early 2001.
 
	Yes, the crowds have been very respectful and very affectionate hellip; It has been a humbling experience, Sachin told The Telegraph.
 
	That this could well be his last tour of Australia (his first was in 1991-92) is probably one reason why fans have been so hysterical.
 
	Well, the welcome has perhaps been more emotional this time hellip; But, then, I cant say why hellip; What Ill say is that Im thankful for all the support given to me and the team, Sachin remarked.
 
	The fans, clearly, are thankful for the countless hours of absolute enjoyment.

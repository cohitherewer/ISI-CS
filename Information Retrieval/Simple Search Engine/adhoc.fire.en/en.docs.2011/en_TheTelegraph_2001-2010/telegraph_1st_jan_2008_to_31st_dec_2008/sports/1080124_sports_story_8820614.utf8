                                                   Serena to play in Bangalore Open

           
	Mumbai: Former world No. 1 Serena Williams will play in the WTA Bangalore Open this year, organisers said on Wednesday. 
    
	The 26-year-old American, winner of eight grand slam titles, had pulled out of the event last year due to illness. 
    
	A statement from the organisers said Russian Vera Zvonareva will also play in the March 3-9 tier II event along with world No. 7 Serena, who lost to Jelena Jankovic of Serbia in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open on Tuesday.

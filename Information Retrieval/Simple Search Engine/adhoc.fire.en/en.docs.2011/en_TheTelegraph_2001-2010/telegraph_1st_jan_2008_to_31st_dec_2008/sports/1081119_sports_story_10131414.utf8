	Margao: Second-placed Air India survived a scare against Churchill on Tuesday. An injury time goal by Michael Tayo helped Air India draw 1-1 in the ONGC I-League match.         
	Churchill, who dominated the major part of the match scored through striker Felix Chimaokwu in the 38th minute.         
	Air India, who were quick on the counter, equalised in injury time. Substitute Samson Singh from the right lobbed the ball to Emmanuel Oveighara into the box, who in turn relayed it to an unmarked Tayo, who tapped the ball into the net.

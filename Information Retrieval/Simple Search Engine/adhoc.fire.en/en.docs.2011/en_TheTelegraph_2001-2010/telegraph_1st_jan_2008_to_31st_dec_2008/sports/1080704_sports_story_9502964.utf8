	 Dakshin Kalikata Sansad (DKS) are mulling a pull out from the prestigious P. Sen Memorial Invitation Trophy tournament due to unavailability of players, club secretary Hiranmoy Chatterjee said on Thursday. According to Chatterjee, the club will send a letter to the CAB on Friday informing them of their decision of not participating in the tournament. Slamming the CAB, Chatterjee blamed the timing of the tournament and said he was even unable to put together a proper team.       
	I want to save myself from further humiliation, he said. Incidentally, Kalighat bundled out DKS for 18 a couple of days back in the J.C. Mukherjee trophy quarter final. CAB joint secretary Samar Paul said the association had nothing to do if any club decide to pull out. It was learnt that the CAB would invite the winner of the district cricket league, if any team pull out.           
	 Charanjeet Singh and skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla guided Kalighat to a mammoth 472 against Sporting Union on Day I of the J.C. Mukherjee semi-finals at the Eden on Thursday. Charanjeet (163) and Shukla (133) raked up a run-a-ball 255-run partnership after their side were reduced to 10 for three within the first two overs.       
	BRIEF SCORES: Kalighat 472 (Charanjeet Singh 163, L.R. Shukla 133; P. Mukherjee 3/141) vs Sporting Union. Match to continue.

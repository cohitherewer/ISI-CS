The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lopez named second player
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lopez named second player
                                Feliciano Lopez   has got the nod      
	Mar del Plata: Spain captain Emilio Sanchez Vicario ignored the world rankings, choosing Feliciano Lopez as his second singles player for the Davis Cup final against Argentina ahead of Fernando Verdasco.         
	It has been difficult to take the decision, Sanchez Vicario, missing world No. 1 Rafael Nadal through injury, told reporters after Thursdays draw for the final that begins on Friday. Fernando is a little bit ahead in the rankings but Feliciano has shown a bit more in training.         
	The draw pitted Spains top player David Ferrer, ranked 12, against Argentinas most experienced, David Nalbandian, in the opening rubber. Lopez will face ninth-ranked Juan Martin del Potro in the second of the opening singles.         
	Del Potro meets Ferrer followed by Nalbandian against Lopez on Sunday.         
	Argentina captain Alberto Mancini provisionally chose Jose Acasuso and Agustin Calleri as his pair for Saturdays doubles while his rival went for a Verdasco-Lopez partnership.         
	Argentina, who have never won the Davis Cup and have lost their two previous finals, are favourites as they attempt to chalk up their 14th straight home win, a run going back to 1998. Spain are looking for a third title.

                                                   Bhajji charged with a Level 2.8 offence

      A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh on Tuesday was charged with a Level 2.8 offence and a 50 per cent fine was imposed on him. 
    
	The following is the full text of the ICC statement following the conclusion of the independent appeal hearing in Adelaide: 
    
	Prior to the hearing, a letter signed by all the players involved  from both Australia and India  was tendered into evidence as an agreed statement of facts as to what took place during the Sydney Test match. 
    
	The hearing lasted the full day before the independent appeals commissioner Justice John Hansen and included video and audio evidence of the incident in question. 
    
	During the hearing, oral evidence was called by John Jordan SC, counsel assisting the appeals commissioner. The hearing heard evidence from all witnesses to the exchange between Harbhajan and a number of Australia players. 
    
	These witnesses were then cross-examined by Brian Ward, counsel representing the Australia players, and advocate V.R. Manohar, who represented Harbhajan. At the conclusion of the oral evidence, legal submissions were then heard from all legal counsel. 
    
	Justice Hansen said he was convinced that, on all the evidence submitted before him, the charge of a Level 3.3 offence was not proven but that Harbhajan should be charged with a Level 2.8 offence. 
    
	Harbhajan pleaded guilty to this charge and, after hearing submissions on the penalty, Justice Hansen imposed a fine of 50 per cent of his match fee.
  
	JOINT STATEMENT BY CA AND BCCI 
 
	The following is the joint media release by Cricket Australia and the Board of Control for Cricket in India: 
 
	Controversy surrounding the incident involving Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds on day three of the 3 mobile Sydney Test has come to a constructive conclusion today, before the ICC Code of Conduct Commission presided over by New Zealand Judge John Hansen.
 
	Singh and Symonds said they had resolved the on-field issue between them in Sydney and now intend to move on.
 
	They said they intended to make no further comment on the issue and intended to get on with the game of cricket, which is the most important issue for each of them. 
 
	Both captains also said they were satisfied with the outcome between their respective players and they looked forward to the cricket battles that lie ahead of the two nations which are currently the top two ranked Test nations in world cricket.
 
	As with Singh and Symonds, they intend to make no further public comment on the issue, preferring to leave on-field performances between the teams to speak for themselves.

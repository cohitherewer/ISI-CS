The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Campaign far from over: Wenger
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Campaign far from over: Wenger

	London: Arsenal may be down but manager Arsene Wenger said they were very definitely not yet out of the hunt for major honours this season, which they can prove when they face Liverpool for the third time in a week on Tuesday.         
	Wenger takes his weary men to Anfield for the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final after two 1-1 draws with Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in the last few days.         
	Wednesdays draw in the first leg of their Champions League tie was followed by another 1-1 draw in the Premier League there on Saturday that left Arsenal third in the table and six points behind Manchester United with five matches to play.         
	Admitting to the clubs website (www.arsenal.com) that Emmanuel Adebayor, Gael Clichy and Aleksandr Hleb were all feeling tired, Wenger also said Arsenals Champions League adventure was far from over.         
	Its a very important one for us and for them. We will play our game on Tuesday night and try to win the game, and give absolutely everything, he said.         
	Wenger, however, tried to bolster Arsenals faltering confidence by insisting on Monday they can still win a Premier League and Champions League double.         
	I still believe we can finish as champions in the league, Wenger told a news conference.         
	Manchester Uniteds result helped us a lot because if they had won, I believe we could not have caught them. But it is compulsory that we win (at United) on Sunday to win the league.         
	I also believe we can win the Champions League. I wouldnt be here if I didnt think that.         
	Wenger has called on his side to show the same strength of character at Anfield that they displayed when they beat AC Milan 2-0 in the previous round after drawing the home leg 0-0.                     
	We need a similar spirit to the one we showed at the San Siro, the Frenchman said. I believe we have to go into the game with the same positive attitude.         
	Liverpool, however, will avoid the temptation to secure Champions League progress on the away goals rule in their quarter-final second leg against Arsenal, manager Rafael Benitez said.         
	We dont want a 0-0 draw, Benitez told a press conference on Monday. I would prefer us to win. For us it is important to score a goal if we want to win the game.         
	Arsenal can score goals away from home so we have to think about winning the game.         
	Benitez does not expect Arsenals focus to be on anything other than the Champions League on Tuesday. I am sure Arsene Wenger thought the race for the title was over on Saturday, but now he will be thinking he has a chance in the league, added Benitez.         
	But this game will be the most important they will have if they want to win a trophy this season.         
	They will try hard to win this game because it will be very difficult for them in the Premier League.         
	Injuries to key players means Wenger has been forced to rely heavily on key players like midfielder Cesc Fabregas in recent weeks, prompting concerns that Arsenal will arrive at Anfield in a tired condition.         
	Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso said fatigue would not be a factor for Arsenal.         
	I dont know if they will be less fresh than us, he said. It is such a big game that I think they will find motivation from somewhere else that will make them fresh enough to perform.

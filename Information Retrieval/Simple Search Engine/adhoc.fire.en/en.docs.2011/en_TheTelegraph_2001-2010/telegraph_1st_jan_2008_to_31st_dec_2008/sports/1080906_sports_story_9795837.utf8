The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Leander, Dlouhy falter
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Leander, Dlouhy falter
            A CORRESPONDENT            Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy in action during Fridays mens doubles final at the US Open                           
	New York: Leander Paes hopes of repeating his 1999 heroics, when he had won both the mens doubles as well as the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon, were dashed as he and partner Lukas Dlouhy went down fighting against the Bryan brothers in the US Open mens doubles finals at Flushing Meadows on Friday.         
	Mike and Bob Bryan, the No. 2 seeds, won 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (12-10) in a hard-fought encounter to regain the No. 1 position in the doubles rankings.         
	The seventh seeded Indo-Czech pair started well, breaking the Bryans, who were playing in front of their home crowd, in the third game of the first set. Paes won the decisive point by stretching to his right and volleying beyond Bob Bryans reach.         
	But Dlouhy, who is usually renowned for his big serve, failed to hold serve in the sixth game allowing the US pair to come back to level terms. Paes came close to losing his serve in the eighth game but some good returns from Dlouhy bailed them out.         
	The first set tie-breaker started well for Paes and Dlouhy with the Czech turning it on in the serving department. But the Bryans triumphed eventually when Paes suffered a mini-break serving at 5-6.         
	The Bryans won almost 40 per cent of their receiving points as compared to Paes and Dlouhys 27 per cent, which made the eventual difference in the match.         
	The second set too was a closely fought encounter with none of the two teams relenting. High winds made serving difficult at times in the Arthur Ashe Stadium. A strange return from Dlouhy, which seemed headed way out was brought back in, thanks to the swirling winds.         
	With no decisive breaks happening, the second set also went into a tie-breaker. A double fault from Dlouhy handed Mike and Bob the early advantage in the tie-breaker but Paes quite incredibly won three perfect points, which included an ace slammed down the middle to take a 5-4 lead from being down 2-4. But the Bryans soon came back to level things at 7-7.         
	The pressure got to both pairs as Mike, and then Paes double faulted. The Bryans squandered a match point while Paes and Dlouhy failed to convert three set points. A mistake from the Indian ace at the nets gave the Bryans the lead at 11-10. Mike Bryan then served the match out, clinching their second US Open doubles title.         
	Speaking after the match, Bob Bryan said, A few crucial points made the difference It was really close. He added: Leanders a legend, its great playing against him.

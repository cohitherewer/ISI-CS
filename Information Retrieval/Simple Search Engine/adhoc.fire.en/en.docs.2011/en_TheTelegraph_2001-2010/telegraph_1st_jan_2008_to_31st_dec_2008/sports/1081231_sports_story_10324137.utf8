The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashraful hits half-century
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ashraful hits half-century
                      
	Dhaka: Captain Mohammad Ashraful hit an unbeaten half-century as Bangladesh batted defiantly in pursuit of a massive victory target in the first Test against Sri Lanka in Mirpur on Tuesday.         
	Ashrafuls eighth Test half century guided the hosts to 254 for five at the close of the fourth day, chasing an unlikely 521 to win the match.         
	Ashraful and Shakib Al Hasan (34 no) shared an unbroken 74-run stand for the sixth wicket to provide the resistance after Muttiah Muralidharan left them in turmoil with a triple strike.

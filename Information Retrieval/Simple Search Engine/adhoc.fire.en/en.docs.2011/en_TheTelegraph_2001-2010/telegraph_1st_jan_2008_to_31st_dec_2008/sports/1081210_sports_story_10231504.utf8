            A STAFF REPORTER            Action during the match between Dempo and Mumbai FC on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Dempo Sports Club, content with a place in the semi-finals of the 30th Federation Cup, did not mind looking second best to Mumbai FC here at the Barasat stadium on Tuesday, finishing their league matches with a 1-1 draw.         
	The Mumbai side came into the game with just two points and no chance of advancing to the semi-finals. But they showed the eagerness expected from a team which has nothing to lose. They took all the initiative and looked hungry.         
	However, it was Dempo who went ahead. The goal was a result of both planning and luck. Joaquim sent the ball across to Clifford Miranda on the right. Clifford headed it to the goal-mouth where Cliffton Gonsalvess marker had him covered. But he failed to connect and Cliffton managed a touch to send it into the goal.         
	The brightest moment of the match saw Mumbai FC make it 1-1. They got a free-kick 20 yards from the goal. Alex Ambroses right-foot free-kick swung past the wall and went in through the second post leaving the goalkeeper stranded.

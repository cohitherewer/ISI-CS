                                                   ICC move stuns Inzy
                      
	Karachi: Former PCB chief Shaharyar Khan on Tuesday termed as shocking, the reinstatement of Australian Darrell Hair in the ICC Elite Panel of umpires, while ex-captain Inzamam-ul Haq chided his board for not adopting a tougher stance on the issue.         
	Inzamam, currently involved with the ICL, said he was shocked by the news of Hairs reinstatement by the ICCs executive board.         
	It has come as a shocker. Especially after all that happened in the Oval Test and afterwards. What more proof did they require (that) Hair was not fit to stand in international matches, he said on Tuesday.         
	Hair and Doctrove then decided that Pakistan had forfeited the Test, which led to a big uproar.         
	I just dont understand it Until 15 months ago this man was not fit for umpiring but now all of a sudden the ICC has changed its decision. It should have taken all the affected parties including myself, Inzamam and the Pakistan board into confidence before taking such a decision, Shaharyar said.         
	Inzamam felt the PCB should have taken a stronger stand on the issue. I dont know what happened in this ICC meeting. I dont know the details but what I do know is that after the Oval Test, it was clear Hair should not supervise international matches. Why that has changed is surprising to me.         
	The former captain said PCB needs to have learnt something from the way the BCCI backed its players on contentious issues.           (PTI)

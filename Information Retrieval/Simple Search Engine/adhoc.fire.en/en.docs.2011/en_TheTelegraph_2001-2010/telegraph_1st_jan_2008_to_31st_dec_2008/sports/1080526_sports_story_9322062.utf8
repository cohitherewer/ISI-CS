The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Good teams bond off the field too, says Yuvraj 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Good teams bond off the field too, says Yuvraj 
    - The Kings XI Punjab captain on his IPL experience             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Yuvraj Singh                                 
	Calcutta: Yuvraj Singhs Kings XI Punjab didnt start the Indian Premier League (IPL) well, but the team has grown stronger as the tournament has progressed.         
	In the city for Sundays face-off against the Kolkata Knight Riders, the debonair Yuvraj (Team Indias ODI and Twenty20 vice-captain) spoke to The Telegraph for around 30 minutes some hours before the match got under way.               
	The following are excerpts from the one-on-one         
	His IPL experience         
	It has been hectic, but has been good as well... Players from different nationalities have come together and thats great for the public and the players themselves... There have been times when weve played with just a days break and, so, life has been moving at a fast pace... Call it the T20 pace if you like...         
	Captaining players from different countries         
	Has been challenging... But it has been fun too and the presence of (Sri Lankan captain and vice-captain) Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, in particular, has helped... We didnt start well, losing the first couple of matches, and it took me time to settle down as captain... Understanding the players... Getting the ideal batting positions right... Working out the field placements... It has been a great learning experience and its with pride that Im leading such a good bunch... My teammates arent just great cricketers, theyre great guys at heart.         
	On even a Sourav Ganguly having required a few matches to settle down as captain         
	Souravs been a great captain for India... Im new to captaincy... Initially, yes, we did have a harrowing time... Today, however, Im more relaxed as captain.         
	Working with Jayawardene         
	Hed been Sri Lankas captain in the World T20 Championship and it had taken him time to settle down... In those early matches, he didnt get enough time to decide on what to do next... Hed turn to Sangakkara for help... The one tip I got from Mahela is that the wicketkeeper must keep a close watch on the angles... Weve talked generally... About what all I really need to look out for... That I should trust my instincts...         
	Having the highly-rated Tom Moody as coach         
	For any team to be successful, its important for the captain and coach to have good coordination... We discussed a few things after the first two losses... We didnt doubt the calibre of the team, its just that things had to fall in place... Its an advantage that Tom has coached Sri Lanka and, so, knows the Sri Lankans very well... Being a provincial coach in Australia, hes familiar with the Australians too... Tom has great ideas and the best thing about him is that he talks of specifics after a win and not after a defeat... Thats a special quality... He wants to experiment and doesnt have fixed ideas and notions... Also, he gives me space and doesnt thrust anything on me... He doesnt, for example, push me into a corner.         
	On who is the boss         
	(Laughs) Its not about who is the boss... The captain and coach need to be on the same wavelength... Tom and I have a good understanding and things have been working well.         
	Having recovered splendidly after the early defeats         
	Sticking together has been critical... Believing in each others abilities... There had been criticism after the first couple of matches, that I hadnt handled the team well and that the team lacked hunger... We discussed that and vowed to be together and to show the world what we were capable of... Bonding off the field is as important as bonding on it... Good teams bond off the field too...         
	Shaun Marsh, who has been an absolute revelation         
	Tom got him for the team because hed been the best young cricketer in Australia... He looked good in the nets and made an impact from his first appearance... This IPL is bound to give him loads of confidence when he heads to the West Indies for the ODIs there... Having faced the worlds best bowlers in the tournament, Shaun wont struggle to find his feet as an Australia cricketer.         
	The lesser-known Indian players whove impressed him         
	Yusuf Pathan... Manpreet Singh Gony... Im surprised he wasnt picked for our team... Yo Mahesh... Abhishek Nayar... Among wicketkeepers, Id pick Wriddhiman Saha... Rohit Sharmas played for India, but he keeps improving and has shown much maturity. He has a sharp mind... I wish Id been as sharp as him when I was 21...         
	Fatigue factor         
	It has definitely been tiring, but the IPL has been a big learning experience... Im sure Im going to be a better cricketer by the end of this first edition.         
	Whether one can actually have a strategy for Twenty20 cricket         
	Youve got to have a plan A and a plan B... You cant do too much, though, because the game is so short... If somebody milks the bowling in the first five or the last five overs, then an upset can be caused... However, whatever the form, youve got to get the basics right... That holds true for Test cricket as also T20.         
	The inconsistency of a team like the Kolkata Knight Riders         
	Look, only four teams can move up (to the semi-finals) and the Knight Riders wont be one of them... All eight were pretty well balanced, but the T20 game is such that you cant really make an assessment of how the matches will unfold... Ive already talked of bonding... Besides, for a team to do well, there shouldnt be any ego and the players must enjoy each others success... The Knight Riders have had ups and downs, but they couldnt have had a better captain than Sourav... Im sure each one in the team tried his best, but things may not work your way.         
	[As it turned out, everything went the Knight Riders way at the Eden on Sunday night.]         
	Finally, whether the Harbhajan Singh-Sreesanth incident in Mohali left him in an awkward position         
	Absolutely... Harbhajans been a childhood friend... Both, in fact, are India mates... It was an ugly moment for everybody and what happened was sad... Both have realised their mistakes and I dont expect a problem when both again sit together in the Team India dressing room... There are fights in every family but, at the end of the day, everybody in the family still loves each other... As Ive said, I dont see a problem and they should bond well... Theyre smart enough to understand their faults... Theyre also big enough to understand

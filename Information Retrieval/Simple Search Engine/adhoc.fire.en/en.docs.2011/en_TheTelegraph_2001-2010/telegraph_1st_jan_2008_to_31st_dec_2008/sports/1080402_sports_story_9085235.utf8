	Calcutta/Islamabad: Even though Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has banned Shoaib Akhtar again  this time for five years  the temperamental fast bowler would still be eligible to play for Kolkata Knight Riders in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	According to IPL rules, Shoaib had been auctioned in February after getting an NoC from the PCB and, unless thats withdrawn, theres no doubt about his availability for the Shah Rukh Khan-owned side.         
	In any case, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf told reporters in a news conference on Tuesday that Shoaib cant play for Pakistan or anywhere in Pakistan. But he is free to play in the IPL which is not within our jurisdiction.         
	The maverick fast bowler was on Tuesday banned for five years for gross misconduct and repeated violations of the players code of conduct, virtually ending his international career which has been plagued by injuries and controversies.         
	The 32-year-old, who appeared before a disciplinary committee earlier in the day on charges of publicly criticising the PCB, has been banned from all forms of game but for the IPL.         
	Ashraf said that the PCB had lost confidence on Shoaib, who was on probation for two years for hitting fellow pacer Mohammed Asif with a bat in South Africa last year.         
	Shoaibs presence damaged Pakistan cricket at every level and he has been banned from playing in any form of cricket, Ashraf said.         
	Shoaib took 178 wickets in 46 Tests and scalped 219 in 138 ODIs during his career.         
	It is a sad day for me and for Shoaib. He is such a talented player, said Ashraf.         
	The PCB chairman said Shoaib had the right to appeal against the decision.         
	Shoaib, on his part, has decided to challenge the five-year ban imposed on him. I am deeply disappointed and hurt. I will go to court and fight the ban, he said on Tuesday.         
	I was demoted from the central contract A category, which was very hurtful and as a reaction I said something. I have apologised to the PCB, before the disciplinary committee and before everyone, he said.         
	So I thought that they would take a lenient action but this harsh decision has effectively ended my career. I still want to play for my country, he said.         
	I have always given 100 per cent for the national team. How can they accuse me of being a damaging influence on the team?         
	The fast bowler said playing for Pakistan meant everything to him. I bowled with high fever during the recent Test series in India, he said. I did it for the team.         
	For me, nothing is more important than playing for Pakistan.         
	Shoaib said he would hire the best lawyers to go and fight his case.         
	I will try to get this ban overturned. It is a stigma for me and a blot on all the efforts I have put in for Pakistan, he added.         
	I will not rest until I get this ban cleared. I have always been committed to the team and given my best. This is how they repay me?, said the fast bowler.         
	Former Test captain Intikhab Alam said the ban was justified as there could be no compromise on discipline.         
	There is no doubt you dont get bowlers of his speed everyday but no compromise must be made on discipline. The board has taken a courageous decision and after showing much patience.         
	Ashraf said that leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, who criticised the PCB for downgrading him in the central contract, was severely reprimanded and warned against making any statements to the media.         
	Since this was Kanerias first offence on discipline, he has been severely reprimanded and barred from issuing any press statements, Ashraf said.

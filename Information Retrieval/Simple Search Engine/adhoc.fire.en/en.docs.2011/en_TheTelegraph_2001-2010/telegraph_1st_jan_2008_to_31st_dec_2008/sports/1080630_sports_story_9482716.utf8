The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI kept mum on Asia Cup fixtures
                                                                                                                                                                                                       BCCI kept mum on Asia Cup fixtures
  - Changes couldve been asked for and effected, says senior ACC official       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Virender Sehwag cools off during a drinks break                                 
	Karachi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had an opportunity to call for a change in the Asia Cup fixtures, when the schedule was circulated six weeks ago, but it remained mum.         
	Thats typical of the BCCI.         
	The fixtures were drawn up by the hosts, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), and sent to the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) for approval... Before giving our okay, wed circulated it to the concerned Boards. Nobody had reservations, a senior ACC official told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, it may be noted, came down heavily on the schedule after Saturdays win over Bangladesh.         
	Dhonis point, and a valid one, is that only two teams (India, Sri Lanka) have back-to-back matches in the Super Four stage. It was the same for both in the qualifying round as well, with Bangladesh and Hong Kong also getting the same treatment.         
	Clearly, the PCB has taken advantage, but it was up to the other Boards to ask for changes. Theres no point blaming either the ACC or the PCB when the concerned Boards didnt even study the fixtures of an out-of-the-season tournament.         
	I think India wouldve done the same, had the Asia Cup been there... Its not that big an issue but, yes, changes couldve been asked for and effected, the senior ACC official pointed out.         
	The Dhonis, meanwhile, had a day off and the team made a trip to the Dreamworld Resort (around 45 minutes from the Pearl Continental) in the afternoon.         
	It was an outing with a difference, aimed at getting the players to relax, remarked manager Arindam Ganguly.

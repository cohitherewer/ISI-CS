The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Riders face Chennai challenge
                                                                                                                                                                                           Riders face Chennai challenge
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re is a nice, peppy slogan but in order to do, fight and emerge victorious, a team must be consistent.         
	Sadly, inconsistency seems the buzzword for the Kolkata Knight Riders as they take on Chennai Super Kings in a cracker of an Indian Premier League match at Eden Gardens on Sunday.         
	The sell-out crowd, however, has cause for worry if Sunday follows the trend set by Saturday.         
	For about an hour from 5pm on Saturday evening, the city witnessed 34mm of torrential rainfall that left the lush Eden outfield waterlogged and the pitches sweaty under the hastily put cover.         
	In fact, when The Telegraph visited the Eden at 10pm the outfield seemed to have dried up, lending credibility to the CAB officials view that barring further rain, the match will start at the stipulated time.         
	The forecast, however, isnt good with thundershowers likely on Sunday afternoon.         
	But for Sourav Ganguly amp; Co., its time not to look at the weatherman but to develop some steel.         
	After the embarrassing and energy-sapping defeat at the hands of a resurgent Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede on Friday night, the Knight Riders must immediately refocus and gear up for what may prove to be a decisive match.         
	What makes matters more complex for coach John Buchanan is the repeated and utter failure of the top order and the over dependence on Sourav and David Hussey.         
	Aakash Chopra has done precious little so far except wasting deliveries (24 in 23 balls; 17 in 13 balls and 1 in 4 balls) in a format where its all about making every delivery count. And after experimenting and fielding six different opening pairs, it seems Buchanan is yet to come up with the right combination.         
	The middle-order has been flamboyant but inconsistent. Batting mainstays Sourav and Hussey has had their moments but a rich innings has invariably been followed by a flop show.         
	The bowling department looks healthier with the arrival of star performer Shoaib Akhtar who almost single-handedly won the low scoring encounter at the Eden against Virender Sehwag-led Delhi DareDevils. But it would too much to expect Shoaib, Ishant Sharma and Laxmi Ratan Shukla to bail the knights out of crisis when the batsmen have crashed to the lowest total of the IPL so far  a measly 67 against the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede.         
	Right arm-spinner Ajantha Mendis of Sri Lanka, inducted recently into the squad, isnt expected to feature immediately even though the team management described him as an exciting talent.         
	Besides the obvious battle for two crucial points, it would also be interesting to see how Team India ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni handle what has been a complete reversal of fortunes for his side.         
	After winning four consecutive matches to begin with, the Chennai Super Kings have suddenly become pedestrian. It has a lot to do with the exit of Aussie powerhouses Matthew Hayden and Michael Hussey but the Chennai outfit, which must win at least two of their remaining four matches, need to get over their mental block.         
	Their bowling looks sharp and penetrative and the Souravs will be put to the sternest of tests on the slow Eden track against the guile of Muttiah Muralidharan or the pace of Makhaya Nitini.         
	Joginder Sharma, who was the only bowler to salvage some pride against the Sanath Jayasuriya onslaught on May 14, will, however, be absent owing to the birth of his son.         
	TEAMS         
	Kolkata Knight Riders (likely): Salman Butt, Aakash Chopra, Sourav Ganguly, David Hussey, Mohammad Hafeez, Wriddhiman Saha, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Ajit Agarkar, Shoaib Akhtar, Ishant Sharma, Ashok Dinda.         
	Chennai Super Kings (from): Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Arun Karthik, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Napoleon Einstein, R Ashwin, Stephen Fleming, Suresh Raina, Abhinav Mukund, Jacob Oram, Makhaya Ntini, Palani Amarnath, Shadab Jakati, Subramaniam Badrinath, Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan, Albie Morkel, Manpreet Gony, Muttiah Muralidharan, Parthiv Patel (wk), Srikkanth Anirudha, Suresh Kumar, Viraj Vilas Kadbe.         
	Umpires: Asad Rauf and K. Hariharan; TV: Amish Saheba.         
	Match Referee: Farokh Engineer.         
	Match starts: 4pm.

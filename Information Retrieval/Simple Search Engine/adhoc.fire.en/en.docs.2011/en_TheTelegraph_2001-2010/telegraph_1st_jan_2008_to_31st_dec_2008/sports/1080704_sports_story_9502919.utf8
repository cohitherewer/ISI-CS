The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SLCA gets a say in contracts
                                                                                                                                                                                                     SLCA gets a say in contracts
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Karachi: The Sri Lankan Cricketers Association (SLCA) is, for the first time, negotiating the players contracts with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).         
	Discussions are on... Hopefully, everything will be in place before the Test series against India (from later this month), a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	While the SLCA is headed by former Test opener Sidath Wettimuny, World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga is at the helm of SLC.         
	The SLCA got recognised a couple of years ago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Playing Murali and Mendis well was the key: Raina
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Playing Murali and Mendis well was the key: Raina
                  Suresh Raina                     
	Colombo: Happy with runs flowing from his blade, Indias young middle order batsman Suresh Raina says he is particularly satisfied to have managed to read the enigmatic Sri Lankan spin duo of Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis.         
	Rainas invaluable knock of 76 in the fourth one dayer not only earned him the Man of the Match award but also helped India take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. The left-hander attributed his knock to his ability to read the Sri Lankan spinners and said he could pick Mendis off his hand.         
	I was watching their hands, especially Mendiss. My plan was that if I can read his hand I can play well. That was the game plan, he said.         
	I think I was able to read both Murali and Mendis well. Scoring 76 and helping my team win is satisfying, he added.         
	Raina was all praise for his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni for his constant support and his leadership skills.         
	Whenever we are at the nets or batting together, he tells me how to plan. He is such a class reader of the game he always plays with responsibility. We learn a lot from him while batting with him. It is good we got partnerships in two matches.         
	The Uttar Pradesh batsman said the young brigade under Dhoni wanted to do well in Sri Lanka after the Asia Cup disappointment.         
	Since we lost the final of Asia Cup in Pakistan, we were very keen to do well in Sri Lanka. We put up a good show here and won a historic series, he said at the post-match news conference.         
	Raina credited his current fine form to the support staff and his stint in the Indian Premier League in which he played for Chennai Super Kings.         
	I am getting into good shape now, and thanks to the people who gave me support such as Robin Singh, coach Gary Kirsten, Venkatesh Prasad and others. They gave me lots of support. Hopefully I will maintain the same intensity, he said.         
	I think I have also improved a lot after playing in the IPL. I learnt a lot from there. My batting is coming on well. The hesitation of playing big shots also seem to have gone from the mind.

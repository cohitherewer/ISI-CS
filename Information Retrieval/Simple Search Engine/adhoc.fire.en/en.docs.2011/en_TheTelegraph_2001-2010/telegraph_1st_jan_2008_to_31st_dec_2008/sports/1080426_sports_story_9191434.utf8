        ICC shifts annual conference to Dubai  New Delhi: In a departure from almost a century-old tradition, the ICC annual conference will not take place in its spiritual home at the Lord rsquo;s but at the game rsquo;s world governing body rsquo;s Dubai headquarters in June.  According to a report in a website, the decision to shift the meeting from Lord rsquo;s to Dubai was taken after Zimbabwe Cricket president Peter Chingoka told the ICC rsquo;s executive board in Bangalore last week that United Kingdom has blocked his visa. With this, a long-standing custom is all set to come to an end, for the annual conference has not been held outside Lord rsquo;s since 1909. The decision to shift venue of the meeting also jeopardises Lord rsquo;s prospect of hosting the ICC centenary celebration, as was initially decided.

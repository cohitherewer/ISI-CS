The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Alford banned on day of Coup
                                                                                                               Alford banned on day of Coup 
            STAR RACER       
	Calcutta: Trainer Harvinder Singh Baths Master Coup won the H.H. Maharaja Jagaddipendra Narayan Bhup Bahadur of Cooch Behar Memorial Cup on Saturday, leading almost from the start to finish to justify his form. It was the horses third victory in-a-row, as also and so was the trainers on the day, having saddled two priced winners  Bright Blossom and Alarico  earlier in the afternoon.          
	Baths coup may not have happened had the RCTC stewards not handled an ugly situation tactfully after a failure of the hot-favourite, Arcology, in the days opener. Jockey C. Alford invited it all, riding the 3-10 hot favourite in an overconfident manner to loose the race to Arisaka  sporting the same colours. A seven-week suspension slapped on the jockey, however, pacified the unruly racecrowd. Alford remains suspended between March 18 and April 11.

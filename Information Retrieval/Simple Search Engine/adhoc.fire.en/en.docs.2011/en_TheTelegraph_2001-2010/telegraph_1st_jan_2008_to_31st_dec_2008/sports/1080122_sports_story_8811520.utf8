                                                   Anand beats Topalov

           
	Wijk aan Zee: World champion Viswanathan Anand defeated former world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the eighth round of the Corus International Chess Tournament on Monday. 
    
	After floundering at the bottom half of the standings for most of the tournament, the Indian has now moved into joint fourth place. With five rounds to go, Carlsen has 5.5 points. Vladimir Kramnik of Russia and Levon Aronian of Armenia follow half a point behind. Anand is next on 4.5 points and giving him company is Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan. 
    
	Anand was at his best in his match against Topalov. The Nazdorf Sicilian by the Bulgarian did not come good. By the time Topalov resigned after 40 moves, he was a pawn down with no hope of survival. 
    
	In group B, P. Harikrishna drew with Erwin LAmi of Holland while Koneru Humpy held Etienne Bacrot of France. In group C, GM Parimarjan Negi kept his hopes alive with a win over Peng Zhaoqin of Holland. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modi open to change
                                                   Modi open to change
                      
	London: Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner Lalit Modi on Thursday said the Twenty20 league was ready to adjust its future schedule to accommodate England players.         
	Modi was reacting to an England and Wales Cricket Board statement that the centrally contracted players were out of IPL bounds because of their commitments to the International Cricket Councils Future Tours Programme, which ends in 2012.         
	We have a huge amount of pressure from the English players to participate in it. Its not that we couldnt sign them but it directly conflicts with their games, he said.         
	Sooner or later we will look at adjusting our programmes. The objective would be to work with the ECB to ensure the overlap doesnt take place, he was quoted as saying by a TV channel.

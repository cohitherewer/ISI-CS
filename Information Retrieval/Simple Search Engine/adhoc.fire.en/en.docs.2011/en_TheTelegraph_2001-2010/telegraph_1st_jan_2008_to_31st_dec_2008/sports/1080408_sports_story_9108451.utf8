The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Buchanan son to join support staff
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Buchanan son to join support staff
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Coach John Buchanans son will be part of the Kolkata Knight Riderss support staff in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Michael Buchanan, the eldest son of the former Australia coach, will be associated with the Shah Rukh Khan-owned side as a trainer.         
	New South Wales coach Matthew Mott will be Buchanans assistant.         
	Michael, a Queensland batsman who also played Rugby Union at under-19 state level, will be involved with Sourav Ganguly amp; Co. in the capacity of a strength trainer.         
	Mott, a former Queensland and Victoria batsman, was elevated to the New South Wales hot seat once Trevor Bayliss was appointed Sri Lankas coach.         
	John wants his son and Mott to be part of his team. They will come here before the camp starts on Saturday, said a Kolkata Knight Riders official on Monday.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting, David Hussey and New Zealand wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum will join the camp at the Eden from Day I. West Indies captain Chris Gayle, however, will arrive only on the eve of the Knight Riderss IPL opener, against Rahul Dravids side in Bangalore on April 18.         
	The West Indies will play the final ODI of a three-match series against Sri Lanka on April 15. So, the possibility of Gayles participation in the camp is ruled out, he said.         
	Meanwhile, online booking of IPL tickets at the Eden entered a second day but the response was lukewarm. Both the Cricket Association of Bengal and Shah Rukhs company, Red Chillies Entertainment Private Ltd, did not reveal the number of tickets already booked.

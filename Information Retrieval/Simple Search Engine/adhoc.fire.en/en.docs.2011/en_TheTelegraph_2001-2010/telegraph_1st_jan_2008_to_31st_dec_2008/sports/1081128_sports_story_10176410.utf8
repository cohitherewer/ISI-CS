The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Prince, Boucher revive Proteas 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Prince, Boucher revive Proteas 
                      
	Centurion: Ashwell Prince and Mark Boucher repelled early Bangladesh pressure with a record sixth-wicket stand to take South Africa to 357 for five at stumps on the second day of the second Test on Thursday.         
	Bangladesh had reduced the hosts to 134 for five midway through the second session but Prince and Boucher replied by adding 223 runs in a three-and-a-half hour spell.         
	Their unbeaten partnership beat South Africas previous sixth-wicket record of 200 scored by Graeme Pollock and Tiger Lance against Australia in Durban in 1970.         
	Both batsmen scored centuries  Prince 115 and Boucher 102  as Bangladeshs bowling became steadily more mediocre through a hot afternoon.         
	The compact Prince scored fluently to collect 16 fours and a six off 160 balls, while wicketkeeper Bouchers 162-ball innings was his first century since scoring 122 not out against the West Indies in Cape Town in January 2004.         
	After Bangladeshs first innings of 250, left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan roared through the middle-order to put South Africa in trouble.         
	South Africa were 192 for five at tea, as the visitors threatened to make a mockery of captain Graeme Smiths comments before the test that he had seen no improvement in Bangladesh cricket since their introduction to the test arena in 2000.         
	Shakib burst through the defences of Jacques Kallis, whom he bowled for 24, and Hashim Amla with excellent arm balls and then had AB de Villiers stumped for a duck two deliveries later as South Africa crashed from 112 for two to 134 for five.         
	De Villiers dismissal ended a world record sequence of 78 innings before his first duck, the batsman rushing down the pitch to his second ball.         
	Amla was caught bat/pad by Imrul Kayes for 71, his wristiness and sweet timing giving rise to 10 fours off 140 deliveries.           (REUTERS)

            HENRY WINTER            Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo celebrate Manchester Uniteds win over AS Roma in Rome on Tuesday. (Reuters)                           
	Manchester United produced one of the performances of their lives in the Eternal City on Tuesday night, goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney guiding Sir Alex Fergusons team within touching distance of the semi-finals of the Champions League, as reported briefly in Wednesdays Late City edition.         
	Initially hesitant as they sought to understand Fergusons special game plan, United caught Roma cold with two superb strikes on the counter. First Cristiano raced through the Italians defence like a Bryan Robson of old, meeting Paul Scholes cross with an imperious header. Then, midway through the second half, Rooney struck after another quickfire break.         
	Before Cristianos magnificent finish from a classic United counter-attack six minutes before the break, legitimate questions were being asked of Fergusons tactics. Initially, the surprising sight of Rooney as a left-winger, Cristiano at centre-forward and Park ji-Sung starting ahead of Ryan Giggs contributed to a disjointed display.         
	Park and Rooney appeared deputed to keep an eye on Romas flying full-backs, Marco Cassetti and the left-sided Max Tonetto. Rooney and Cristiano switched at times, seeking to deceive Romas centre-halves but it took time for Fergusons tactics to pay off.         
	Only when Cristiano suddenly raced in from a deep position for the first time in the half, catching Roma unawares, did United resemble the most potent force in English football.         
	Until then, United stuttered. Rio Ferdinand lost composure and the ball to Mirko Vucinic, Romas striker who failed to seize a glorious early chance. One shuddered to think of what fate may have befallen Ferdinand and his fellow defenders had Francesco Totti been fit, lending such class to Romas movements in the final third.         
	Until Ronaldo again played their saviour with his 36th goal of the season, Roma looked the likelier to score. Christian Panucci headed just over from David Pizarros corner as Uniteds defence froze.         
	United lacked an outlet, with Rooney wasted on the left and Cristiano too closely shackled by Philippe Mexes. The Portuguese flier ran keenly enough, but too often down culs-de-sac, or into chunks of French granite called Mexes.         
	Cristianos every touch drew sustained derision from the terraces and they laughed when his outrageous attempt to score with a 40-yard free-kick trickled wide. He shrugged and set about plotting the sacking of Roma.         
	First, United had to survive some alarming moments. Pizarro set the tempo in deep midfield, guiding the Italians on. Taddei and Mancini brought glimpses of Brazilian flair to the flanks, ensuring that Patrice Evra and Wes Brown had to be at their most alert.         
	These were slightly worrying times for United. Vucinic, falling off-balance, hooked a shot narrowly over. When the Montenegran next threatened, Nemanja Vidic leapt to clear well but at a painful cost, the Serbian twisting his knee and calling for urgent medical attention.         
	Confusion briefly reigned in the United dug-out. Ferguson was unsure whether Vidic could continue and despatched Giggs as a runner. Word came back to bring on a replacement, and John Shea shortly arrived. Roma sensed vulnerability, yet United showed their character and their class, seizing the lead brilliantly.         
	The build-up was majestic. Rooney, breaking in from his left-sided station, gained the ball in a central area, and effortlessly turned Mexes. So frustrated by French defenders in Paris last week, the England international showed his technique and vision here.         
	The break was on. Rooney immediately sensed Scholess long run down the inside-right channel, and picked him out with a superb pass. Scholes still had much to do to turn play back into the area. Blessed with such good technique, he chipped the ball back in and there was Ronaldo, arriving like an arrow, muscling above Cassetti to head powerfully in.         
	As Scholes punched the air, Cristiano fell down, Charlie George-style, as his colleagues ran to leap on him. The Portugueses predatory touch was a contrast with Vucinic, who poked the ball embarrassingly wide moments later as the Roma fans sighed in disbelief.         
	The familiarity between the two sets of supporters appeared to have bred only contempt. For the fifth meeting in a year, the atmosphere in this modern coliseum was initially stoked up by United fans, who taunted the Roma tifosi with chants of Paolo di Canio, the darling of Lazio. Roma fans hit back with a wall of sound, and plumes of smoke swirling from flares.         
	But when Cristiano scored, silence spread for a while around the home fans. They still stirred into splenetic life when Cristiano gained possession, and a flurry of step-overs brought jeers from the crowd and an attempt by Pizarro to give the Portuguese magician a dead leg.         
	Cristiano was continuing to trouble Mexes, who eventually responded with a foul, and then a tirade at the United No 7. Still Roma pressed, but the English champions were in determined mood, Ferdinand continually blocking shots. Ferguson sought to stiffen his midfield by introducing Owen Hargreaves and withdrawing Anderson.         
	Roma coach, Luciano Spalletti, tried to inject more creativity by sending on Ludovic Giuly, who almost fashioned an opening on the hour, but United cleared. Then Edwin van der Sar pulled off a wonderful save, somehow managing to keep out Vucinics header.         
	United seemed on the ropes, but then they sensationally added a second. When Park headed Browns cross back across goal, Doni fumbled and Rooney reacted quickest, tapping the ball over the line.         
	United were in dreamland, their fans singing of winning the European Cup for the second time under Ferguson. Roma fans began leaving, particularly when Cristiano almost added a third, only to be denied by the post.         
	Cristiano played down his goal simply saying his 36th of the season was a good header and preferred to comment on the teams overall performance.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I wouldnt put it beyond Sehwag to break Laras record: Gooch
                                                   I wouldnt put it beyond Sehwag to break Laras record: Gooch
  - Former England captain, the first to take a triple off India, on the latest headline-maker         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                         Graham Gooch      
	Calcutta: Almost 18 years ago, Graham Gooch became the first to take a triple hundred (333 at Lords) off India in Test cricket.         
	On Saturday afternoon, the former England captain and one of the giants of the modern era (well over 100 first-class hundreds, 20 of them in Tests) spoke to The Telegraph from his residence in Chelmsford. The interview was largely Virender Sehwag-related.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On Sehwags 319 at the Chepauk         
	To get one triple hundred in Tests is fantastic, but Sehwag has now got two And within four years Hes definitely one of the most exciting batsmen and has answered his critics well.         
	Whether hed been surprised at Sehwags omission when Team India toured England last summer         
	I dont recall the form he was in immediately before that tour, nor do I follow the politics of Indian selections But, yes, I was surprised that somebody as talented as Sehwag wasnt in the squad Besides being a quality batsman, hes a good off-spinner and adds value Obviously, hes proved the selectors wrong and if I were an Indian selector, Id be very happy at the turn of events. For a batsman, the best way to respond is with big scores Sehwag has done exactly that.         
	The effort it takes to get a triple in Test cricket         
	(Laughs) Its a test of your skill, your temperament Your powers of concentration are put to the sternest test The conditions in Chennai have been taxing and, so, Sehwag wouldve had to draw on all his reserves Its remarkable that the fastest triple of all time came in such demanding conditions.                   
	His 333 at Lords         
	Dont think too much of that innings, unless when Im reminded of it There had, of course, been a lot of talk about the 333 when India toured England On a personal note, its nice that Im the sole triple hundred-achiever at Lords         
	The approach he adopted         
	I didnt keep looking at the scoreboard and, really, hadnt set out for a landmark innings I took it session by session Id got a big hundred for Essex versus Lancashire shortly before the Test and had also got a hundred against New Zealand at Edgbaston So, Id been in form and the thing about form is that youve got to cash in when the going is good I was lucky to have been dropped in the 30s (by Kiran More off Sanjeev Sharma), but there are times when things dont go your way. (After a pause) That Lords Test saw very fine performances from some of the others as well and I myself got another hundred (123, in the second innings)... I had a pair on debut (versus Australia, 1975), making no contribution, and Ive got the record for the maximum runs in a single Test  456 Well, Ive experienced it all, havent I?         
	Whether hed become conscious about nearing the then record, Sir Gary Sobers 365 not out         
	Not really I wasnt batting for milestones When I got out, trying to up the scoring rate, (cricket manager) Mickey Stewart scolded me in the dressing room He felt that I shouldve gone for 366.         
	The one most capable of getting past Brian Laras record (400 not out)         
	Look, the record will be broken No disrespect to anybody, but there are some weaker sides today Also, the wickets are probably more flat nowadays Of course, the scoring is definitely quicker I suppose an opener has the best chance, given that he can spend the maximum time at the crease.         
	Whether that opener could be Sehwag         
	Possibly He scores at a terrific pace I wouldnt put it beyond him         
	On the impact a triple hundred has on the opposition         
	(Laughs) Fortunately, I didnt have to suffer on the field Nobody got a triple in a Test I was playing in Theres little that can be done if somebody is in such great form One way out could be to bowl on one side of the wicket The South Africans lack a quality spinner and, so, theres little variety in their attack This lack of variety, I suppose, makes it tougher for Graeme Smith.         
	Finally, his message for Sehwag         
	Congratulations and keep on entertaining You do a fine job (After a pause) Im sure Sehwag will be a big hit in the upcoming Indian Premier League Im all for going forward and Twenty20 is a vehicle for doing that But, having said that, I wouldnt like Twenty20 to interfere with the integrity of Test cricket Weve got to be careful.

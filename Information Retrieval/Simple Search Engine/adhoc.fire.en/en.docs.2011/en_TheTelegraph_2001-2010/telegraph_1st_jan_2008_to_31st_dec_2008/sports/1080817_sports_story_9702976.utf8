	Beijing: The International Olympic Committee stripped the bronze medal Saturday from a Swedish wrestler who had complained about the judging in his Greco-Roman competition and had discarded his medal during the awards ceremony in protest.         
	The wrestler, Ara Abrahamian, was disqualified for violating the spirit of fair play of the Games and had his athletes credential revoked, according to the I..C.         
	A contentious penalty that cost him a chance to compete for a gold medal in the middleweight division Thursday left Abrahamian furious. News reports said that he had to be restrained from wrestling officials after the incident.         
	He later won a bronze medal in a consolation match, but did not participate in the full medal ceremony. Abrahamian had finished second at the 2004 Athens Olympics after a similarly disputed call.         
	In a disciplinary hearing on Friday, Abrahamian said he had been a victim of blatant errors in judging. The IOC accused him of violating two rules of the Olympic Charter that ban demonstrations in official Olympic areas and prohibit the showing of disrespect for other Olympic athletes. The awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual, the IOC said in a statement. Any disruption by any athlete, in particular a medallist, is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the Olympic movement.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	IPL final to be held at DY Patil   
	Mumbai: The IPL final has been shifted out of Wankhede to the DY Patil Stadium because of its bigger capacity, BCCI president Sharad Pawar said Wednesday.  
	 quot;I have taken the decisionas we expect more than 6,000 people from overseas, including top officials from ICC and other boards. The Wankhede can accommodate only around 32,000 and DY Patil can house around 55,000. Its (the difference) huge, quot; Pawar said.         
	Pawar said the Maharashtra Cricket Association has also decided to demolish the present Wankhede Stadium structure and re-build it from scratch before the 2011 World Cup. Pawar also said Mumbai has to build a new stadium elsewhere with a capacity of around 1 lakh.         
	Pak players         
	Karachi: The PCB Wednesday forced former Test players Shabbir Ahmed and Rana Naved to drop out of a one-day game against Hong Kong after the two were named in a local team despite being banned from domestic and international tournaments for aligning with the rebel ICL.         
	Departmental team, Wapda, had surprised everyone by naming the two in their squad to play Hong Kong at the Bagh-e-Jinnah. They even named Shabbir as the captain for the match as Hong Kong are in Pakistan to prepare for the forthcoming Asia Cup tournament.         
	Wapda was told the two could not play any match in Pakistan organised by the Pakistan board because of the ban on them, an official said.         
	Mani adviser         
	London: Former ICC President Ehsan Mani has agreed to advise the PCB in their sale of media rights, which he said on Wednesday should earn the board at least $100 million.         
	The PCB announced on Wednesday that the rights, to broadcast their home international matches over a five-year period from 2008-09, would be open to tender from July and the deal should be concluded by September. If Manis forecast is accurate, the PCB could witness more than a 100 percent jump from the current deal with Ten Sports and ARY, who paid $43 million in 2003  which was also more than a 100 percent rise from the previous agreement. I would be disappointed if they sold for any less than $100 million, Mani, an expert in the media rights sector, said.         
	PPL response         
	Karachi: The PCB has got a tremendous response to buy franchise rights/sponsor teams in the planned Pakistan Premier League Twenty20 competition.         
	A senior official of the board Wednesday said the only thing holding up the organisation of the Pakistan edition of the tournament was finding a slot in the packed Future Tours Programme.         
	I can tell you this much the response from companies and organisations and even individuals to buy franchise rights or sponsor teams in the PPL have been beyond our expectations, the official said.

	Madrid: Davis Cup debutant Sam Querrey faces a baptism of fire in Fridays semi-final opener after drawing world No. 1 Rafael Nadal on clay in front of 21,000 spectators in Madrids Las Ventas bullring.         
	I can go out there and make faces but theres not much more I can do, Querrey told reporters after the draw.         
	I have to play aggressive, connect with some big serves and dictate the points, added the 20-year-old, who lost 2-6, 7-5, 6-7, 3-6 to Nadal in the fourth round at this years US Open.         
	Querrey, who at two metres towers over Nadal, was called into the squad by US captain Patrick McEnroe after an exhausted James Blake withdrew, which further stacked the odds against the champions.         
	I actually think its good that Sams playing first, said McEnroe. He doesnt have to sit in the locker room listening to 20,000 people whistling.         
	In the second match of the day, American Andy Roddick, the world number eight, plays fifth-ranked David Ferrer and the Spaniard forecast a difficult match.         
	The key is going to be returning the ball. Its going to be a long game, said the Valencia-born 26-year-old.         
	The host teams opposition to playing in Madrid  with its faster courts at 660m above sea level  has led to a public spat with Spanish tennis federation chairman Pedro Munoz.         
	However, Roddick played down the effect of altitude on the specially-built clay court.         
	Its not a slow clay court but its not the fastest Ive seen either, said the big-serving American who during his career has won two out of three of his clay court matches and five titles on the red dust.         
	If Im playing well, I feel good on clay. Ive been hitting the ball really well this week, I feel good.         
	Saturdays doubles had offered the US its best chance of a point but Spains Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez have a better chance following injury to Bob Bryan  one half of the worlds top-ranked doubles pair.         
	With Bryans late withdrawal, twin brother Mike will play Saturdays match with US Open quarter finalist Mardy Fish.Mike Bryan said despite not playing with anyone but Bob in six years, training was going well as he and Fish worked on routines and signals. Bob should be worried, he joked.         
	Roddick will play Nadal in the first of the reverse singles on Sunday  the Spaniard has a 3-2 career record against him  followed by Querrey against Ferrer as Spain seek to repeat their 2004 victory over the US in Seville.

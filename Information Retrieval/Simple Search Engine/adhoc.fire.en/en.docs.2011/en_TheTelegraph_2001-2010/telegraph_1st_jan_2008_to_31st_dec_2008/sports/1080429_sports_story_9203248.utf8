            A STAFF REPORTER            Shaun Pollock in the city on Monday                           
	Calcutta: Shaun Pollock, Mumbai Indians stand-in captain in their last match against Deccan Chargers, on Tuesday said the side would miss Harbhajan Singh in the Indian Premier League.         
	He is an important player with a lot of experience in the subcontinent conditions. To miss him for the remaining matches is a blow for us. He is one of our most important players, Pollock said after landing in the city on Monday night.         
	Has the Harbhajan episode been a distraction for the side? Weve tried not to focus on what was happening through the day Nothing was in our hands. As a side weve been trying to get the best result. We obviously need to regroup and come out with a good strategy. Were looking to do well as a team and not focus on any individual, he said.         
	Sachin Tendulkars availability was still unclear, Pollock said. The physio will be in a better condition to say anything on Sachin His condition is being monitored The physio will take a decision Tuesday morning.         
	Pollock said the team was aiming to come back after losing all their four matches. Weve got to come up with different options. Its an opportunity for the young guys to stand up and be counted as a team. Weve got to be back on the right track. It hasnt been a good start for us. Theres still an opportunity to get back the confidence. We need to believe that we can do well as a team It will take a big effort to make a comeback.         
	He said he was aware of Knight Riders strengths. Knight Riders are a good side and have been playing well. They will enjoy a lot of support in Calcutta. It should be a good, competitive match.

            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT      
	Set Alight fully justified her short odds with a smashing victory in the 1,600m Fillies Trial Stakes, the first Classic of the Bangalore summer season on Sunday. Jockey Malesh Narredu partnered the brilliant filly who whipped a strong field of 15 on her way to a six-and-half length victory. The runaway victory of the three-year-old filly, trained by Pesi Shroff, also raised hopes of her Classic prospects during the winter season for her owner Vijay Mallya. Bred at Usha Stud farm, Set Alights next target is learnt to be the Bangalore Derby before she leaves for Pune.

                                                   A breath of fresh air

      Serve amp; Volley : Naresh Kumar 
              
	Tsongas victory over Nadal lit up the Melbourne sky like a supernova. 
    
	Nobody had humiliated Nadal in such a manner, not even Federer. The Spanish bull fell like our sensex. Nadals robust defence, built on his fearsome spinning ground shots and mercurial mobility, were destroyed by the power, touch and consistency of Tsongas magical tennis which cast a spell on former greats like Mats Wilander. Its never going to be a surprise again, hes that good a player, said Wilander. 
    
	Early in the third set, Nadal failed to convert a couple of break-points as Tsonga raised his service level past 210 kmph. Nadals never-say-die spirit eventually succumbed. He shook his head and had a slight smile on his face, as if to say one has to accept the inevitable. 
    
	What endeared Tsonga to the millions that watched him was his childlike simplicity which was like a breath of fresh air. There was an audacious abandon in the shots he played. Who else but a madman would try a drop volley off a low, spinning Nadal passing shot from close to the service line! 
    
	Time and again, Nadal was left stranded on the baseline as Tsonga brought off the most incredible drop volleys. He was not chiselled and hard like the top pros who play the boring percentage shots. Tsonga took the game away from the unending baseline rallies. 
    
	It was heartening to see Tsonga attack unhesitatingly at the net. At times he also followed his service to the net. It could be that his style of play will encourage budding youngsters to develop an all court game to use the whole court and develop all court excellence. 
    
	Tsonga has knocked Nadal off his invincible pedestal and shaken his confidence. This is bound to affect his play in the future and give heart to the pack of players eyeing Nadals slot. Fairytale, supernova brilliance, birth of a star  call it if what you want to. The fact is, Tsongas display was pure magic. Will the spell be broken in the final? Well know soon.

	 The IFA sparked off a controversy on Thursday after deciding to stop the WB Police-SAIL Super League match in Kalyani midway through the second session. Four championship and relegation playoff matches were scheduled for the day with only the Customs versus Mohammedan AC being completed.      
	The Tollygunge Agragami-BNR tie at Howrah was abandoned due to rain. Eastern Railway were leading by a goal against Police AC at Rabindra Sarobar after 87 minutes when the police side refused to continue citing bad light.      
	All such last round matches should be held together. Matches have been stopped like this in the past too, said an IFA spokesman. The IFA will decide on the outcome of the matches on Saturday.

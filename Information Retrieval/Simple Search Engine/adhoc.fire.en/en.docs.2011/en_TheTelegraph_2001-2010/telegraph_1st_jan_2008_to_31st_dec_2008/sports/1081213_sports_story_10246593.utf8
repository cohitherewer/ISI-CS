The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | T20 League in October
                                                                                                                                                                                                     T20 League in October
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The inaugural edition of the Champions League 2020 would be held in October 2009, the organisers said on Friday.         
	The $6 million T20 tournament was to be held from December 3-10 this year but was cancelled following the November 26 terror attacks in Mumbai.         
	The decision was taken after considering all aspects including the international calendar and the domestic schedules of the participating teams, a statement from the Champions League 2020 governing council said on Friday.         
	But key issues  including the number of teams to participate  are yet to be resolved.         
	Six teams  two from each of the founding Board members (BCCI, Cricket Australia and Cricket South Africa)  are confirmed as participants, the statement said.         
	Asked if the six teams from the founding member countries mentioned above would get a berth when the tournament is held in October, Sundar Raman, CEO of the CL2020, told The Telegraph: No, they will have to re-qualify.         
	There was also speculation that these teams might seek compensation citing commercial tie-ups they had entered into.

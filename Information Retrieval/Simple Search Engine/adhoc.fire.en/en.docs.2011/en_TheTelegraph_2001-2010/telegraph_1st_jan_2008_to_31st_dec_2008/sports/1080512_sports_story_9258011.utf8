The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Novak Djokovic rallies to beat Wawrinka
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Novak Djokovic rallies to beat Wawrinka
                      
	Rome: World No. 3 Novak Djokovic rallied to beat unseeded Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and claim the Rome Masters title on Sunday.         
	Wawrinka had the better of the early exchanges and took the first set after breaking Djokovic in the fifth game.         
	The Serb hung in during a spell on the back foot and pulled himself back into contention with a break in the middle of the second set.         
	He then took Wawrinkas serve again at the start and end of the final set to bag his 10th ATP title and his fourth Masters Series crown.         
	Wawrinka called his trainer on for some treatment on his lower back after the fifth game of the decider. Djokovic kept the momentum going his way and Wawrinka had to work hard to hold serve two games later, saving a break point.         
	But he surrendered shortly it shortly after, Djokovic producing a superb forehand to the corner to wrap up the title.         
	Wawrinka will move from 24th into the top 10 of the rankings next week after getting past former world No.1s Juan Carlos Ferrero and Marat Safin and seeds Andy Murray, James Blake and Andy Roddick to reach the final.

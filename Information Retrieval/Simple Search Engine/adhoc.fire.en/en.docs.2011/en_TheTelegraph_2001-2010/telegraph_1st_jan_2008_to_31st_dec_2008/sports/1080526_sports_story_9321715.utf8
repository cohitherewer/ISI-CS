The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Grant finds no ally in Mourinho
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Grant finds no ally in Mourinho
                  Avram Grant                     
	London: Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has described Chelseas season as really bad and said their campaign could be described as great only by someone with the philosophy of a loser.         
	Mourinho, who left the English club in September, made his comments on the day that the man who succeeded him, Avram Grant, was sacked.         
	Chelsea issued a statement on their website on Saturday saying the club had terminated Grants contract.         
	Mourinho, asked in an interview whether the season had been a good one as depicted by Grant, replied: That depends on your philosophy of leadership.         
	In my philosophy it was a very bad one because in football almost means defeat and Chelsea almost won the Carling (League) Cup, almost won the Champions League and almost won the Premier League. Almost is nothing, he told the local daily.         
	After two titles per season for the last three years, there were zero titles this season, which in my philosophy means a really bad season. Maybe in the philosophy of a loser this was a great season, which I respect, he said in the interview published on Sunday.         
	Mourinho admitted to being very sad at Chelseas defeat in Moscow to Manchester United in the Champions League final, adding that the supporters, the board and the players deserve more.         
	I am very sad about what happened. In the last two years this team lost a Champions League final and a Champions League semi-final on penalties. The supporters deserve more, (the players) and some others deserve happiness. I still think of them as my boys.         
	However, he added: I believe that after an empty season new success will come to Chelsea. And I will always be a Chelsea supporter.         
	Mourinho is being linked with a return to Stamford Bridge alongside names including Frank Rijkaard, Guus Hiddink, Roberto Mancini and Marcello Lippi.         
	Grant was being linked with a move to Manchester City if Sven-Goran Eriksson is sacked by Thai owner Thaksin Shinawatra.         
	Meanwhile, a report from Jerusalem quoted former international midfielder Eyal Berkovic as saying that Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich sacked manager Avram Grant because he realisbed the Israeli would not be able to take the club any further.         
	I have already said that Avram made a number of serious mistakes: His inability to communicate with the English media ... his failure to befriend the fans and the undermining of Jose Mourinho, Berkovic said.

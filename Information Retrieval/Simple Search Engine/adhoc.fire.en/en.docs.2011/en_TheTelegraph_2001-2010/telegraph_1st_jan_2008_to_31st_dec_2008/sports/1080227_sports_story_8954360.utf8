	New Delhi: Karan Rastogi on Tuesday provided yet another twist to the tennis drama when he said he was ready to play under Leander Paes. 
    
	Two days after he joined Prakash Amritraj and Rohan Bopanna to demand Paes removal from captaincy, Rastogi made a complete U-turn and said he had sorted out issues with his captain. 
    
	I have no problem playing under any captain, Rastogi said during the ITF Futures tournament here. What is more important is playing for the country. 
    
	As far as I am concerned, the chapter is closed. I need to focus on my game rather than getting into controversies. I have even sorted out the issue with All India Tennis Association (AITA). 
    
	Rastogi, however, admitted there were some issues that made him sign the joint letter to All India Tennis Association (AITA). 
    
	Obviously, there were issues with Leander (Paes). I am not denying that. But it is human to make mistakes and I hope he (Paes) learns from his mistakes. 
    
	Denying that he was under pressure from AITA, Rastogi said: This is my own decision and nobody elses. I want to focus on my practice and matches. My career is more important than these controversies, he said. 
    
	Despite Rastogis denial, it was clear that the tough stand taken by AITA had an influence on Rastogi. AITA secretary Anil Khanna not only welcomed Rastogis decision, but also hoped that other players would fall in line and the controversy would die down soon. 
    
	 I had a discussion with Karan and his father, Khanna said. His father understood the whole thing and Karan agreed to change his decision. 
    
	 For AITA, players are the most important, Khanna added. We want peace and harmony and want all players to respect each other. 
    
	The AITA is also planning to write to all members of the Davis Cup team, including Mahesh Bhupathi, Prakash and Bopanna, asking them about their availability for the Davis Cup tie against Japan in April. Though it is considered a routine affair before every Davis Cup tie, the move assumes significance in the light of the latest developments. 
    
	The AITA executive committee is likely to meet this week.

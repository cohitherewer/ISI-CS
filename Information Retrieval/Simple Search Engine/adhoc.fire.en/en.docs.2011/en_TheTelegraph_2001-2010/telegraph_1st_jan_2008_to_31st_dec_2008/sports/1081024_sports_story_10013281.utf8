            A STAFF REPORTER            Soumik Chakraborty of United SC tries to get past JCTs Amandeep Singh at the Salt Lake Stadium   on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: United SC did everything but score against a hapless JCT in their ONGC I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. The barren draw left JCT with eight points from five matches while United have five from as many games.         
	Taking the field without seven of their regulars, Subrata Bhattacharjees men exhibited attacking football that left JCT stuck to their zone. United SCs domination was so complete that JCT managed to trouble the rival goalkeeper only twice in the entire match. That Gopal Das made a mess of the seemingly harmless attacks on both occasions is another matter.         
	United impressed with their passing, distribution, anticipation and quick change of position. Dulal Biswas squandered a penalty but Soumik Chakraborty, Ayan Chowdhury and Snehasish Chakraborty were equally guilty of shooting over from close. Till the veteran Basudeb Mondal was replaced, he held centre-stage in the midfield.         
	I am happy with the performance. The boys played according to our strategy. Our performance is creditable considering JCT are among the top teams in the tournament, said Subrata.         
	Im happy with the one point. The boys are all new but didnt show any nerves on the field. There is not much difference in quality in Indian football and its a matter of applying yourself on the given day, the United SC coach added.         
	JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh said: Eduardo is not fit and I was forced to substitute him after the first half. I expected this kind of a fight from United SC. They can stop anybody. With very little blocking or snatching in the JCT midfield, United SC players easily made their way into the rival penalty area. But their lack of experience showed as they lost way thereafter.         
	After Dulals penalty was saved by Karanjit in the 39th minute, Ayan missed a header from close.         
	Mrinmoy Chakraborty wasted another golden opportunity at the start of the second half. A little later, Snehasishs through ball went a begging after a couple of players lurking inside the penalty box dithered over the shot.

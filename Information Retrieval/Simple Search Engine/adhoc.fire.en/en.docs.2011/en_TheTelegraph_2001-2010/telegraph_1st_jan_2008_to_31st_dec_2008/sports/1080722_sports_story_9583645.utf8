	Leeds: South Africa defeated England by 10 wickets in the second Test at Headingley on Monday to take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series with a day to spare.         
	England, who made 203 on Friday, were dismissed for 327 in their second innings shortly before the close on Day IV, leaving South Africa needing only nine runs to win.         
	South Africas winning performance was dominated by centuries from AB de Villiers (174) and Ashwell Prince (149) as they set up their teams imposing first innings total of 522. De Villiers revealed he was motivated by boos from the crowd and abuse from England players after he claimed a catch on Friday that was shown to have bounced first.         
	Andrew Flintoff, in his first Test for 18 months, resisted South Africas victory charge in an unusually slow innings of 38 from 95 balls before he was caught at second slip off Morne Morkel. The time in the middle should at least be some consolation for him and England.         
	The day started well for England as nightwatchman James Anderson took some painful blows to the body from Dale Steyn while making a Test best 34.         
	South Africa attempted to unsettle the stubborn Anderson and in the 45th over Steyn struck him between the arm guard and glove on his facing right arm and he required immediate medical attention to check there was no damage.         
	After a five-minute delay, Steyn bowled Anderson another spiteful short ball that crashed into the grill of his helmet.         
	Anderson fell to the ground instantly and an 11-minute delay separated the third and fourth balls to demonstrate the seriousness of the blow.         
	He was eventually trapped lbw in front of middle stump and received a standing ovation for his 111-minute resistance that spanned 80 deliveries. It was Steyns 50th Test wicket of the year.

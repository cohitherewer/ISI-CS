                                                     Finest Test knock Ive seen: Dilip
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Dilip Vengsarkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni                           
	Chennai: Four years ago, on March 29, Virender Sehwag completed his maiden triple century in Multan. On Saturday he will get the chance to overtake his 309 and chase Brian Laras 400.         
	There is already a heightened sense of anticipation all around. It will be great if he can do it tomorrow (Saturday), said Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Dilip Vengsarkar is not thinking about such records. The openers triple century left the selection committee chairman dazed on Friday.         
	Its the finest Test innings Ive seen. Two triple hundreds in a lifetime That too in 278 deliveries! Amazing! Goes to show his batting qualities, Vengsarkar told The Telegraph.         
	The innings shows his fitness, determination, temperament and the will to succeed. Batting for a full day in such stifling conditions is no joke. Sehwags propensity to play long innings also helped him in his endeavour, Vengsarkar said.         
	He hit a century in Adelaide and has now played a special knock. The way he kept attacking was amazing. I consider myself lucky to have witnessed the innings, he added.         
	Dhoni was also effusive in praise.         
	One of the best Ive seen. I wasnt around when the Multan innings happened and so it was great to be part of it here People may think that the wicket was easy but that was not the case Youve got to adjust to the circumstances. Superb innings, the Team India one-day captain said in between cracking a joke on Sehwags near the dressing room.         
	Rahul Dravid also described Sehwags knock as phenomenal and simply exceptional batting.         
	The former India captain, who was an onlooker at the other end, added: The range of shots was terrific and he was creative.

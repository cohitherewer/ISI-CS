      OUR CORRESPONDENT
              
	Guwahati: A lower-order charge led by debutant Swarupam Purkayastha went in vain as Assam lost to Orissa by just four runs in a thrilling encounter in the Ranji East Zone National One-Day tournament for the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the Nehru Stadium on Tuesday. 
    
	Orissa paceman Santosh Jena bowled an impeccable last over to deny Assam the seven runs needed for victory as the hosts managed just two to end up with 239 for nine in their 50 overs in reply to Orissas 243 for victory. 
    
	For Assam, Swarupam played a cavalier innings of 60  including five fours and a six  and had raised visions of a victory along with wicketkeeper Rajdeep Das (17, 4x1) as they shared a rollicking 66th run partnership for the sixth wicket. 
    
	In another match, Tripura pulled off a five-wicket win against Jharkhand. 
    
	Set a modest target of 180, the Tripura batsmen almost made a mess of the chase before skipper Rajesh Banik and Rajib Dutta stitched together an unbroken 37-run partnership for the sixth wicket. 
    
	Banik remained unbeaten on 34 (4x4) and Dutta remained not out on 26 as Tripura overhauled the target in 46.3 overs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australias India tour on track
                                                                                                                                                                                           Australias India tour on track
                      
	Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) on Monday said Saturdays serial blasts in New Delhi will have no impact on Ricky Pontings teams upcoming India tour, unless it was otherwise persuaded.         
	He said Australias tour was on, and as scheduled, the team was planning to leave on September 21.         
	Our position is that the tour is going ahead unless we are otherwise persuaded, CAs general manager of public affairs Peter Young said.         
	Our advice is there are some concerns and to exercise caution, but currently they do not compromise the tour. Our plan is to depart on September 21 subject to our advice, he added.         
	The Australian government, meanwhile, made it clear that they would only pass on security advice but the final decision would rest with the cricket board itself.         
	We will do what we do with CA whenever they are looking at a difficult tour...we will provide them with all our up-to-date travel assessments and advice briefs, foreign minister Stephen Smith told a TV channel.         
	And they are also, as I understand it, getting their own independent security advice. In the end its for CA to make a decision, which is how we have dealt with the proposed Pakistan Test tour and the proposed Champions Trophy, the minister said.         
	CA also dismissed claims that they were applying different yardsticks while assessing security threats in India and Pakistan.         
	Its very simple. You go to the experts and if they say dont go, you dont go. If they say go, you go. The advice we have received in recent times for India has been be cautious, which was completely different to Pakistan. That advice was dont go, Young said.         
	CA officials are scheduled to meet the representatives of the Australian government to take an update on the safety situation in India.         
	CAs general manager of cricket, Michael Brown, is also expecting a report on Tuesday from the teams security advisor, Reg Dickason.         
	The threat assessment for India has been considerably lower than that of Pakistan, Australian Cricketers Association chief executive, Paul Marsh was quoted as saying by the Australian media.

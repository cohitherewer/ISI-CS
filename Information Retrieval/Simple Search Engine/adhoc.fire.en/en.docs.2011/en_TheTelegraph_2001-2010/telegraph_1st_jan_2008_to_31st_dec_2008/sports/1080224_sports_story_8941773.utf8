The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A success story called Dempo
                                                   A success story called Dempo
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Dempo Sports Clubs amazing record  three National Football League (now I-League) titles in four years  is testimony of their supremacy.         
	At a time when the Calcutta teams are busy throwing out players and sacking coaches, Dempo have managed to retain their core group for several years now. The results are for everyone to see.         
	Dempo added just three players to their roster this season. Edeh Chidi, Nicolau Borges and Mahesh Gawli, who reportedly signed a three-year contract for more than Rs 1 crore.         
	Apart from only Ishfaque Ahmed, who left, Dempo retained their entire first XI. And it has been like that for several years since Armando Colaco returned to the Goan side in 2001.         
	Another hugely satisfying aspect of Dempos triumph was how the replacements proved to be equally good, if not better than the originals.         
	Anthony Pereira made light of the absence of Jerry Zirsanga while Clifford Mirandas shin bone fracture was compensated in good measure by Borges on the left flank.         
	Even when Anthony and Valerian Rebello were unavailable towards the later stages, Cressan (Antao) and Johnny (DCruz) did a wonderful job. Dominic (Noranho) too stepped into the boots of Gawli appreciably for the final game, said Armando.         
	But Dempo had their share of worries when the goals dried up and the mighty Goans won only one of their six matches between the 12th and the 17th round after picking up 27 points from their first 11 games.         
	Their two foreign strikers  Ranty Martins and Chidi  looked in terrible form and to add to their woes, Armando met with a road accident.         
	But once again Dempo players delivered the goods like they did in the ninth NFL when they almost snatched the title from Sporting Clube de Goas grasp on the last day.         
	Even last season, when Mahindra United seemed to be going great guns, Armando and his boys never lost sight of the title and bagged it in the end.

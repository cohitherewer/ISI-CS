	Bangalore: A splendid all-round display enabled Rajasthan Royals cruise to a comfortable seven-wicket victory against Royal Challengers Bangalore in their IPL match on Saturday (reported in Sundays Late City edition).         
	For the second successive time, the Bangalore outfit failed to rise to the occasion in front of the home crowd at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, making just 135 for eight in 20 overs after being invited to bat.         
	In reply, the team led by legendary Shane Warne reached the target, losing only three wickets with 17 balls to spare.         
	Man of the Match Shane Watson, who dismissed both Dravid and Shivnarine Chanderpaul early, stole the show with a well-compiled unbeaten 61 off only 41 balls with eight fours and two sixes. Graeme Smith made a useful 49 before departing just before the victory was achieved.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ballack keeps hopes alive
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ballack keeps hopes alive
    - Chelsea beat United 2-1 at Stamford Bridge                 Michael Ballack jubilates after his second goal on Saturday                           
	London: Chelsea beat Manchester United 2-1 in a dramatic match at Stamford Bridge on Saturday to pull level at the top of the Premier League and keep alive their hopes of snatching the title from Uniteds grasp. Michael Ballack was Chelseas scoring hero, deciding the game with an 86th-minute penalty after heading the home side ahead at the end of the first half.         
	The Chelsea players celebrated that goal by unfolding a number eight shirt with Pat Lampard RIP on the back following the death of midfielder Frank Lampards mother on Thursday. He was given compassionate leave by the club and missed the game.         
	Wayne Rooney equalised for the visitors when his 56th-minute shot went in off the post after a careless backpass from Ricardo Carvalho.         
	With two matches to play both teams have 81 points, although United remain top because of a better goal difference.         
	Despite the defeat United will still win the title if they match the same number of points that Chelsea collect from their last two games at Newcastle United and at home against Bolton Wanderers.         
	Uniteds last two league games are at home to West Ham United and away at Wigan Athletic.         
	Ballacks late winner came after Michael Carrick was judged to have handled a cross from Michael Essien just minutes after Wes Brown appeared to have also handled in the area. Chelseas appeals for that infringement were waved away by referee Alan Wiley, but he pointed to the spot after Carrick handled and Ballack kept his nerve to send goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar the wrong way.         
	Chelsea took the game to United from the kickoff and the visitors found themselves in trouble in the opening minute when Browns careless header forced goalkeeper Van der Sar to scramble low to his left to save. The home side, who had to win to maintain their hopes of catching United and winning the title produced some of their most exciting and attacking football for months in the opening stages.         
	Michael Essien fired over the bar, Didier Drogba shot wide and Joe Cole hit the bar as Chelsea surged forward in the hot spring sunshine at Stamford Bridge where they are now unbeaten for 81 league matches since February 2004.         
	United, who trained in London on Friday after returning from their Champions League semi-final first leg in Barcelona, looked tired and jaded and lacking the spark that typified many of their performances earlier in the season.         
	What was already turning out to be a difficult afternoon for them took a turn for the worse when defender Nemanja Vdic was carried off on a stretcher in the 15th minute after Drogba accidentally kneed him in the face as they went for the ball.         
	The tall Serbian defender, who was hospitalised in Spain with a stomach infection, lost a tooth in the collision and went off with blood seeping from his mouth. Chelsea maintained the pressure on United with Essien, Joe Cole and Ballack combining superbly in midfield, while Uniteds attacks petered out ineffectually and it was just reward when the home side went ahead at the end of the half.         
	 Drogba did well to create space for himself and then provided the perfect cross for the unmarked Ballack to head home past Van der Sars despairing dive.         
	United looked far sharper after the break and Rooneys goal appeared to have secured them what would have been a deserved point before Ballacks late decider.         
	Chelsea manager Avram Grant later described the win as very emotional.         
	The normally stony-faced Israeli, in his 50th game for the club since taking over from Jose Mourinho last September, even cracked a smile when he said he felt optimistic Chelsea could overturn Uniteds lead with two games left in the Premier League.         
	Grant, who has suffered criticism for Chelseas dour play in recent months, said he enjoyed the fans noisy appreciation of an exciting match. I think they appreciated the commitment and spirit of the players and their energy, he said.         
	Grant praised substitute Andriy Shevchenko, for making the save of the year off the line in the dying moments of the game. He also said midfielder Frank Lampard, missing after the death of his mother, would decide for himself whether he was ready to return for Wedensdays Champions League semi-final against Liverpool.         
	We need to leave the decision to him...on the way to excellence you also have to be human, he said.         
	Ballack, named Man-of-the-Match, after his first-half header and 86th minute penalty said he had felt his responsibility keenly when he stepped up to the spot for the kick normally taken by Lampard. But for me it was not a problem. I can handle the pressure, he said.         
	Ferguson and his players were furious with the officials who gave Chelsea the 86th-minute penalty.         
	Its a major decision that cost us the game, Ferguson said. If the title is going to come down to decisions like that, were in trouble. If were not getting the decisions we deserve, were going to have to perform really well.

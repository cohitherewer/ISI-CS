The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alonso is the king of   the night
                                                                                                                                                                                           Alonso is the king of   the night
                            
	Singapore: Fernando Alonso of Spain snapped a year-long drought to win the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday, Alonso won the first-ever night race in dramatic conditions after a comical error cost Felipe Massa dearly.         
	It was the Renault drivers first victory since the Italian Grand Prix last year, and capped a remarkable weekend that saw him top two of the free practice sessions but start 15th on the grid after a mechanical problem in qualifying.         
	He claimed his 20th career triumph by 2.95 seconds over Germanys Nico Rosberg in a Williams. Britains world championship leader Lewis Hamilton came third.         
	Toyota driver Timo Glock was fourth with Toro Rossos Sebastian Vettel following up his win in Italy this month with fifth. BMW Saubers Nick Heidfeld was sixth.         
	The race was a new experience for every driver on a street circuit under powerful spotlights and it turned out to be one of the most exciting races of the season. Despite dark clouds lurking over the head, Singapores notorious tropical downpours stayed away and the whole race was run in dry, but hot and humid conditions.         
	Ferraris Massa started from pole but a disastrous mistake cost him the race and valuable points in his push for the world title.         
	His 13th place finish means he is now seven points behind Hamilton in the championship hunt with just three Grands Prix left at Japan, China and Brazil.         
	The Brazilian was in the pits on lap 15 when he was given the green light and drove off with the fuel hose still attached to his car, leaving one of the pit crew floored and subsequently carted off in a neck brace         
	Massa ended up sitting in his Ferrari at the end of the pit lane as the crew ran after him and managed to pull the hose free, but it ruined his chances. He was given a drive through penalty and rejoined in 18th place.         
	It was a miserable night for Ferrari with defending world champion Kimi Raikkonen ramming his car into the barriers with just four laps to go.         
	The Massa drama occurred after the cars came in when Nelson Piquet careered into the wall on the exit from turn 17, bouncing into the barriers on the other side of the track, causing massive damage to his Renault. He climbed out unscathed but the safety car was deployed.         
	Massa was leading at the time with Hamilton second but at the restart, Rosberg was in front followed by Jarno Trulli and Giancarlo Fisichella, with Robert Kubica fourth and Alonso fifth.Hamilton was ninth, but Rosberg and Kubica were subsequently slapped with a 10-second stop penalty for coming into the pits after the Piquet crash before the pit lane had opened.         
	The complicated scenario saw Toyotas Trulli in the lead on lap 28 but without having pitted with Alonso second, Rosberg third and Hamilton charging in sixth.         
	With Trulli taking his first pit stop soon after Alonso, who started from 15th on the grid, amazingly found himself in front just after the halfway mark with a 4.9-second lead over Rosberg.         
	Alonso came in for his second pit stop on lap 41 and came out still in the lead, marginally ahead of David Coulthard and Hamilton. (AFP)

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sania, Mattek crash out
                      
	London: Sania Mirzas Wimbledon campaign ended Wednesday after she and Bethanie Mattek lost to Williams sisters Venus and Serena in straight sets in the quarter finals.         
	The 13th seeded Indo-American pair lost 4-6, 3-6 to their more fancied 11th seeded opponents. The quarter final appearance though was Sanias best performance at Wimbledon.         
	Sania and Mattek were in even terms with their opponents for a while in the first set but the American sisters better serve and power tennis finally caught up with the Indo-American pair who ran out of steam in the second set.         
	Sania had already crashed out of the singles and mixed doubles competition  pairing with Mahesh Bhupathi  losing in the second round in both the events. (PTI)

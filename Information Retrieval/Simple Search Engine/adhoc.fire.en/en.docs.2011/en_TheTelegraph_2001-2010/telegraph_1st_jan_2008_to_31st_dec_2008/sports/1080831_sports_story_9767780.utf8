The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto likely to play today
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Barreto likely to play today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sunday may witness what may eventually be the final of the ongoing Sahara CFL Premier Division when city giants Mohun Bagan lock horns with Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	While a win for leaders Mohun Bagan will almost ensure them this years CFL title, a triumph for the black-and-white brigade will keep the title race wide open.         
	Second-placed Mohammedan Sporting are tied with Bagan on equal points (23)  they have played one match more  a difference which according to coach Shabbir Ali is a huge disadvantage for them.         
	With uncertainty looming large over the availability of Theodore Sunday, skipper custodian Naseem Akhtar, defenders Sheikh Azim, Francis Nova and Prem Kumar who are all likely to sit on the sidelines on Sunday, Mike Okoro will be hoping to play Mohammedan Sportings saviour.         
	Talking about his tactics, Shabbir said: I have very limited options and almost no replacements And that can be crucial on a day when you are facing a team like Mohun Bagan.         
	We have played one match more and thats clearly a disadvantage for us and injury problems have worsened things for us, he added.         
	But I am still optimistic that the boys will never give up their fight so easily. They are in good touch, especially players like Satyajit Bose, Roque Barreto are capable of turning things around on their day, Shabbir pointed out.         
	Meanwhile, Bagan coach, Karim Bencharifa kept his cards close to the chest.         
	They are a good side and have played very well in this league. Whatever be the situation I know they will give us a tough time, Bencharifa said.         
	While veteran Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto is likely to make a comeback on Sunday, Karim however, will miss P.C. Lalwmpuiya (double yellow) and Ishfaq Ahmed and Branco Cardozo (both yet to recover from injuries).         
	A win tomorrow is crucial, it will almost ensure us the title Both Okoro and Sunday are dangerous players and can win matches on their day We need to be cautious, the Moroccan said. Kartik Kisku is likely to start with Malswamtluanga if Barreto fails to make it to the first XI.

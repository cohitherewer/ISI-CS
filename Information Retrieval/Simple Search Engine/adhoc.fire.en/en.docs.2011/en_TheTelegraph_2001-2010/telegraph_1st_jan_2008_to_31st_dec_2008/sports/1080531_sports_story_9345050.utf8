The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes moves into third round
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Paes moves into third round
                      
	Paris: The ninth-seeded pair of Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy moved to the third round of the mens doubles at the French Open on Friday when they defeated the Argentine duo of Jose Acasuso and Sebastian Prieto 6-4, 6-4.         
	In a late match on Thursday, the Indian Davis Cupper Rohan Bopanna became the second Indian to see curtains on his campaign in the doubles after he along with his Pakistan mate Aisam-ul-haq Qureshi were outplayed by top-seeded Americans Mike and Bob Bryan in the opening round.         
	The unseeded Indo-Pak, who made their Grand Slam debut as a pair, went down 1-6,4-6 in just 53 minutes in the first round clash.         
	The Bryan brothers stamped their authority without any fuss as they raced away with the first set in just 24 minutes.         
	Bopanna and Qureshi did put up a fight in the second set, winning four games, but their American opponents were too experienced and superior in class that there was hardly any threat of an upset.         
	The winners were dominant in winning points on the first serve and also converted four of the nine breakpoints that came their way.         
	The Indo-Pak pair on the other hand could win only one of the five.           (PTI)

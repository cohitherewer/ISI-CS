The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal tied 46th
                                                   Atwal tied 46th
                      
	Livermore: Arjun Atwal stumbled on a wretched five-hole stretch and dropped three shots there to finish with an opening round of one-over 73 that had the Indian pro at tied 46th in the Livermore Valley Wine Country Championship here.         
	Back to the Nationwide Tour in his quest to regain his pga tour card, Atwal played his back nine first and was off to a good start with birdies on the 10th and 12th that placed him two-under.         
	But bogeys on the 13th, 16th and 17th undid the good work. The Orlando-based Indian did pick up a shot on the first but he again slipped to over-par with a seventh hole bogey.         
	Meanwhile, J. J. Killeen did not look like greenhorn in his rookie season on the Nationwide Tour as the San Diego native blasted a course-record-equalling seven-under 65 to grab the lead.

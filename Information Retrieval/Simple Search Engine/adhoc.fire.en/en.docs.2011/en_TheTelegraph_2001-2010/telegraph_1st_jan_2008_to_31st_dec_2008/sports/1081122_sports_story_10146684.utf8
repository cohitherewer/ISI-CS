                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev moves up to tied 10th

	Calcutta: Jeev Milkha Singh raised his game in the nick of time and blasted a sizzling seven-under 63 to zoom to tied 10th even as six Indians missed the cut after the second round of the Hong Kong Open in Fanling on Satur- day, according to a press release.         
	Jeev fired as many as eight birdies against a lone bogey to take his two-day aggregate to six-under 134  two stroke off the leaders  and tied with Lin Wen-tang of Taiwan and Britains Rory McIlroy.         
	A 10th tee starter, Jeev birdied the 11th and 13th holes and ended with a birdie-birdie finish to make the turn at four-under.         
	On his backward journey, the Chandigarh golfer picked up a shot at the third and sank a hattrick of birdies between the fifth and seventh holes before dropping the lone bogey in the eighth hole.         
	Meanwhile, after a disastrous 71 in first round, Jyoti Randhawa brought home an improved card of two-under 68 to catapult to tied 46th, while compatriot Gaurav Ghei carded one-under 69 to lie tied 61 with a total of even-par 140.         
	However, Rahil Gangjee, who shot 68 in the first round, had a nightmarish day in the greens. The Bengal golfer dropped as many as five bogeys against two birdies to total one-over 141 and miss the cut by just one stroke.         
	Playing his back nine first, Rahil picked up successive birdies at 12th and 13th before dropping a shot at the 18th. But it was his front nine which cooked his goose as he stumbled on a bogey quartet to card a three-over 73 to languish at tied 83rd.         
	Among other Indians, Arjun Atwal (69), Shiv Kapur (69), Amandeep Johl (75), S.S.P. Chowrasia (74) and Digvijay Singh (77) also missed the cut.         
	South Africas Louis Oosthuizen fired a sizzling eight-under 62 to grab a share of the lead after the second round.         
	The 26-year-old Oosthuizen carded eight birdies in a near-flawless round to finish a stroke shy of the course record and join Britons Oliver Wilson and Oliver Fisher, and Chawalit Plaphol of Thailand, on 132.         
	Wilson notched up six birdies on the way to a four-under 66, but squandered the outright lead with a bogey on the last.         
	I was really happy with yesterday, four-under, but today I was little disappointed with bogeying the last, the 28-year-old said.         
	After losing a play-off to Spains Sergio Garcia at the $5 million HSBC Champions in Shanghai last week to finish runner-up for the eighth time in his career, Wilson said he would try to keep the near-misses from his mind over the weekend.         
	After carding a patient first-round 68, eight-time European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie attacked the greens with gusto on Friday, dropping a single stroke on the way to a six-birdie 65 to lie a shot off the pace.         
	Montgomerie, whose form woes have seen him tumble out of the world top 100 this year, joined Swede Johan Edfors, Australian Marcus Fraser, round one joint leader Richard Sterne of South Africa and Italys Francesco Molinari in the clubhouse on 133.         
	Six-time Major champion Nick Faldo will miss the weekends action after carding a scratchy even-par round of 70 to finish on 142, two strokes behind the cut.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clark: Tour will be tough for spinners
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Clark: Tour will be tough for spinners
                      
	Melbourne: Australian pace bowler Stuart Clark has cautioned their uncapped spinners Bryce McGain and Jason Krejza against Indian batsmens strength to play spin and said it would be an interesting challenge for the duo in the subcontinent.         
	India are great players of slow bowling and they (McGain and Krejza) are going to be put to the test straight away, said Clark.         
	It will be a matter of how they step up. We have got full confidence in them, he told a radio channel.         
	The paceman said they had discussed the issue during the training camp ahead of the India tour.         
	We did discuss it very briefly in our camp at Coolum. What weve got to remember is these blokes are proven performers in whatever cricket they have played. They have done well somewhere otherwise they wouldnt have got picked. Weve got to try and take that (view), he said.         
	But its going to be an interesting challenge for them. I cant lie about that, he added.         
	With Symonds omitted and Beau Casson  who made his Test debut in the Caribbean this June  overlooked, the pressure will be on McGain and Krejza to contain the Indian batsmen.         
	Clark also expressed sympathy towards trouble-torn Symonds, who has vowed to amend his ways.         
	It was great to see him come out (and speak). It was great to see hes committed to playing again and we look forward to him working his way back into the team because he brings a lot to the team.         
	The fast bowler also rubbished criticisms from Pakistan Cricket Board officials terming Australias policy to tour India as double standards. (PTI)

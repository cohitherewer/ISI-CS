                                                                                                                                                                                                     Super victory for West Indies
                      
	Wellington: The West Indies beat New Zealand in a super over decider after their first Twenty20 international had ended in a tie at Eden Park, Auckland on Friday.         
	After the visitors had finished on 155 for eight, tied with New Zealands 155 for seven, each team nominated three batsmen to face one over.         
	The West Indies captain Chris Gayle smashed three sixes and a boundary off counterpart Daniel Vettori to help his side post 25 for one.         
	Xavier Marshall had been run out off the second ball while attempting a second run to keep Gayle on strike.         
	Jacob Oram hit the first ball of Sulieman Benns over for six, scampered for two on the second but was caught in the deep off the next delivery.         
	Ross Taylor then hit a no ball for six to take New Zealand to 15 for one with three balls remaining, but was bowled on the next ball to give the West Indies the victory.         
	Earlier, the West Indies wasted a swashbuckling 67 off 41 balls from Gayle by losing four wickets for 21 runs off 19 balls towards the end of their innings.         
	Gayle smashed five sixes and five boundaries in his innings and the visitors were coasting to victory at 109 for two in the 14th over. (REUTERS)

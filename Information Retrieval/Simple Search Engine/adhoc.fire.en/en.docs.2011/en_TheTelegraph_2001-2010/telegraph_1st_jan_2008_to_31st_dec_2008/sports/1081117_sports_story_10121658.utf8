                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mohun Bagan make it three in a row
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagan scorers Ishfaq Ahmed and Jose Ramirez Barreto at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan displayed excellent attacking football in the first half to score two goals and then defended superbly in the second half to bring up their third win in a row after they had been reduced to 10 men against JCT in their I-League encounter on Sunday.         
	The green and maroon brigade played with a man less for more than 45 minutes after defender Peter Odafe was sent off in the 44th minute.         
	Ishfaq Ahmed scored the first goal in the 15th minute off a defensive lapse by JCT. James Singhs (Sr) cross from the left fell behind the defenders and caused a moment of indecision. The visitors back four were left stranded while Ishfaq went for the ball and reached it first to nod it over the head of the advancing goalkeeper.         
	Julius Akpeles foul on Jose Ramirez Barreto earned Bagan a controversial penalty and a resultant second goal in the 30th minute. The decision looked a bit harsh on JCT and put paid to any hopes they had of staging a comeback in the match.         
	However, the visitors had their chance of making the green and maroon brigade pay when Odafe was given the marching orders after a second booking for a foul on Jagpreet Singh.         
	Odafe was earlier booked for a foul on Sakhtar Singh in the 12th minute.         
	The Phagwara-side failed to take advantage of the extra man as Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa, who started with a 4-4-2 formation, switched Rakesh Masih from midfield to central defence and made Barreto operate from the midfield.         
	Brazilian Marcos Pereira, who was till then operating as an attacking midfielder, was made to don a defensive role. Bhaichung Bhutia played as the lone striker upfront.         
	JCT had their chances, but failed to find the mark. Amandeep Singhs scorching right-footer hit the post and Sakhtar wasted the easiest of chances, sending the ball skywards with an open net in front.         
	Bagan goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee also denied the visitors on a couple of occasions.         
	Ishfaq was adjudged Man of the Match but Barreto too would have been a pertinent choice given the workload he took.         
	The green and maroon brigade, thus, notched up their third win in a row  the Calcutta premier division league champions beat heavyweights Dempo and Churchill Brothers in their last two matches  to reach 12 points from eight matches.         
	They are currently placed fifth on the table, just behind East Bengal who are on the same points after beating Sporting Clube de Goa, but ahead on goal difference.

	Manchester United reacted furiously on Tuesday to Real Madrids continuing interest in their prized asset, Cristiano Ronaldo.         
	United threatened to report the Spanish champions to world footballs governing body, Fifa, unless they stopped their public attempts to unsettle the player. In a hard-hitting statement on the official club website, United said they had watched with growing irritation the comments attributed to the Madrid club.         
	United insisted that Ronaldo was not for saleand said: No one should be in any doubt that Manchester United will do everything in its power to keep its best players.         
	They added: The facts are: the player is on a long-term contract and his registration is held by Manchester United. United also accused Madrid of behaving in a totally unacceptable fashion. and argued that their comments were proving a distraction for Ronaldos Portugal ahead of the Euro 2008 finals.         
	The 136-word statement marked a new low in relations between the clubs, two of the giants of European football. Last week, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson described Madrid as being morally bankrupt because of their attempts to lure Ronaldo.         
	Ramon Calderon, the Real president said,I am really surprised to hear what he said about us. I dont understand Ferguson. Real Madrid have conducted themselves exquisitely in this whole affair with Cristiano Ronaldo. We have always said that he is a player who has a contract and that Manchester United is not a selling club. Thats everything.         
	But on Tuesday Bernd Schuster, the Real coach, was quoted in a Spanish newspaper as claiming that Ronaldo was Reals priority transfer target this summer. For the fans, this signing would be a spectacular boom, a bit like what we saw with David Beckham here, he said.         
	There are other players that weve been tracking for months, although it seems that most things have stopped, partially because Cristiano Ronaldos our priority right now.         
	Ronaldo is under contract until 2012 and both Ferguson and Uniteds chief executive, David Gill, have strongly dismissed the possibility of selling him this summer, despite the prospect of securing a world record 64 million transfer fee for the forward.

	Indian Wells: Sania Mirza and Bethanie Mattek stunned Yung-Jan Chan and Chia-Jung Chuang of Chinese Taipei to move into the doubles semi-finals of the Pacific Life Open on Wednesday night.         
	The Indo-American pair prevailed 7-5, 4-6, 11-9 in a gruelling quarter final of the Tier I event.         
	Chuang and Chan are world No. 9 and 10 in the WTA individual doubles rankings list while Sania and Mattek are 25 and 36. Sania and Mattek next take on third seeds Zi Yan and Jie Zheng.         
	The Chinese pair defeated the Czech-Polish combine of Iveta Benesova and Agnieszka Radwanska 6-0, 6-4.         
	Indias challenge ended in the mens doubles event after Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles lost in the quarter finals. The sixth-seeded Indo-Bahamian pair lost 3-6, 4-6 to fourth seeds Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram of Israel.         
	In singles action, Rafael Nadal came back to win the final five games and beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a rematch of their Australian Open semi-final. Nadal, the defending champion, avenged his lopsided loss in Melbourne with a scrappy 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) 7-5 victory in the fourth round.         
	After Tsonga, a hard-hitting Frenchman, went up 5-2 in the third set, Nadal held serve the rest of the way and broke Tsongas serve in the ninth and 11th games to take a 6-5 lead.         
	No. 1 Roger Federer, bidding for his fourth Indian Wells title in five years, cruised to a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Ivan Ljubicic to also move into the quarter finals.         
	Maria Sharapova ran her 2008 record to 18-0 to move into the womens semi-finals with a 7-6 (2), 6-1 victory over defending champion Daniela Hantuchova.         
	Sharapova won the tournament in 2006, and Hantuchova has taken the title twice, the first time in 2002.         
	James Blake took a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Richard Gasquet, and Mardy Fish beat two-time Indian Wells champion Lleyton Hewitt 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (4) to advance to the quarter finals. With the crowd beginning to cheer even as he set up for the shot, Nadal capped the match by slamming an overhead past Tsonga.         
	The 22-year-old Tsonga, who has vaulted from 212 in the rankings in 2006 to No. 17, upset No. 2 Nadal 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 in the Australian Open semis before losing to Novak Djokovic in the final.         
	Nadal insisted he wasnt out for revenge, but acknowledged that the match was significant in another way.         
	He is going to be one of the rivals for this year, will try to be in the top positions, so I try to win. These matches are very important always, the 21-year-old Spaniard said.         
	After ending a long rally when both hit several outstanding shots, Tsonga ended it with a drop shot  that Nadal somehow managed to hit back  then a bang-bang volley that left Nadal lying on the ground at the end of the point.

	Mysore: Trainer Arjun Mangalorkars ward Abs Fabs posted an upset victory over Star Presentation and Attractress in the 2,000m Poonawalla Mysore Derby here on Sunday. The 2-1 course-favourite Archipenko, however, came a cropper midway through the journey but the horses jockey, C. Alford, is leant to have escaped unhurt. Star Wave, the second-favourite, just about managed to finish fourth.

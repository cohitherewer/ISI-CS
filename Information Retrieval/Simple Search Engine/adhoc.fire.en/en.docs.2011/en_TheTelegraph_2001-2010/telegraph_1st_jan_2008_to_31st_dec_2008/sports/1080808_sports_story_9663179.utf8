The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Big score is due from Big Guns: Kumble
                                                                                                                                                                                             Big score is due from Big Guns: Kumble
            A CORRESPONDENT            Anil Kumble during a practice session in Colombo on Thursday. (AFP)                           
	Colombo: Anil Kumble, Team India Test captain, said he was not worried about the failure of his top batsmen to contribute with the bat but added that a big score is due from them.               
	Following are excerpts:         
	Down 0-1, the comeback and the pitch in the third Test         
	Ive always said the pitch isnt in our control, but in terms of confidence, in terms of strategy, we have done whatever we could to ensure we win the Test and the series. That will be the bottom line. Weve done that once against Australia in 2001, if I remember right, having been down 0-1, and that was in India. These are different conditions and all of us are looking forward to going home with the series win.         
	On the absence of Kirsten         
	Gary will be missed, but he needs to be with his mother. That is most important. We all realise our responsibilities as cricketers.         
	There are enough support staff to take care of things off-field. And obviously well sit down and discuss what needs to be done. We already have done most of it, and it will be good to finish the Test series on a winning note.         
	The P. Sara pitch         
	It looks a hard track with lot of grass. Im not sure how much grass will be there in the morning. As of now, it will help our fast-bowling attack as well. It looks a good surface. To win any Test you need to get big runs and 20 wickets and thats something well be concentrating on.         
	The Big Guns failing to contribute with the bat         
	Thats a great thing that without them getting runs we have won a Test match pretty comfortably. And Im not worried; if they score runs that is due, things will be fine. All 11 need to contribute not just the tailenders.         
	We have been working hard on our batting as well, so whether it is Sourav with his bowling or myself with the bat, everybody is keen to contribute.         
	The Sehwag-Gambhir opening partnership         
	Ive always believed cricket is a partnership game Applying pressure at both ends, as a bowling unit and as a batting unit Without Gautam Gambhirs contribution, Virender Sehwag couldnt have got the double hundred Everyone contributes, its a team sport I thought I bowled pretty well  its coming out nicely, and Im looking forward to this Test and contributing.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shah Rukh shouldnt have been stopped, says Modi
            A STAFF REPORTER            Shah Rukh Khan                           
	Calcutta: A day after saying that the Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) officials of the International Cricket Council (ICC) were doing their job in asking Shah Rukh Khan to stay away from the dressing room and dugout, Lalit Modi did a U turn, declaring that the Kolkata Knight Riders owner was within his rights to be present there.         
	There is no controversy Shah Rukh shouldnt have been stopped, the IPL chairman and commissioner said on Tuesday.         
	The Telegraph has carried the picture of players and officials who should be allowed entry into the dressing room. Shah Rukh features among them So you cant deny him access, Modi added.         
	This is, however, in sharp contrast to what Modi had said on Monday.         
	The IPL is conducted as per the rules and regulations of the ICC whose ACSU officials were just doing their job, he had said in Mumbai.         
	Shah Rukh was asked to refrain from visiting the dressing room and dugout during the match against Chennai Super Kings on Sunday.         
	He didnt say anything then but made his displeasure clear during a function back at the team hotel later in the evening.         
	The megastar has since been provided with a red badge which allows him access to all areas of the ground.

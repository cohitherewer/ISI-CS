The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Els a big Tendulkar fan
                                                  Els a big Tendulkar fan

	New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkars fan following transcends far beyond the boundary of cricket.         
	Former world No.1 golfer Ernie Els has confessed that he too is an admirer of the Indian icon.         
	Cricket was among the games young Els excelled in before golf lured him away. But despite his busy schedule, the world No.4 seems quite informed about the recent developments in cricket and believes India are undoubtedly the second best team after Australia.         
	India are definitely a good side. I think they are No.2 in the world right after Australia. They are quite a competitive side and most of their batsmen are quite aggressive, he said.         
	Singling out Tendulkar for special praise, Els said: Sachin is an unbelievable player, one of the greatest ever. I love watching him. Your (one-day) captain (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni is also a good striker of the ball. I also like Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid.         
	You have a good (Test) captain in Anil Kumble as well, he said.         
	On his memory of playing cricket when he was a kid, Els said: I was an allrounder and bowled medium pace.         
	Crickets loss, however, turned out to be golfs gain with Els rising to the world No.1 ranking.         
	Of late, Els has had an intriguing battle with Tiger Woods, apparent from the fact that he has finished second to the iconic American more than any other player. In last weeks Dubai Desert Classic, Woods pipped the towering South African to walk away with the title.         
	A three-time major winner and a perfect ambassador of the game, Els has been eyeing the pole position once again and in 2007 he announced a three-year plan to edge out Woods from the perch.         
	I mean, its going to be difficult. Im finishing high but Im not winning enough. I have to be on the roll and Im searching for that winning streak, said Els as he prepares to tee off in the Indian Masters, the countrys first European Tour event which gets underway at the Delhi Golf Club here.         
	Im excited to be part of the first European Tour event in India, which has been an unknown territory for most of the top players, Els said.         
	He also predicted a bright future for golf in the country. Indians excel in ball games  be it cricket, hockey, tennis. The economy is booming and you have a surging middle class. Its natural that they would do well in golf.         
	While China is tipped to be the next big golf destination, Els felt the Indian players have proved themselves superior in the international arena.         
	You have so many good golfers. Ill be playing with Jeev (Milkha Singh). He has won in Japan, Asia and Europe. Then you have Jyoti (Randhawa), Shiv Kapur and Arjun (Atwal), who plays in the US. Compared to China, I think Indian golfers have come through rather quickly.         
	The re-laid Delhi golf course seemed to have bowled him over. It reminds me of South Africa. The type of grass, vegetation, some trees are similar. The layout here is quite old-fashioned which I really like. Obviously the course is playing a little short but the greens are well designed and its well-bunkered, he said.         
	On his prospect over the next four days, Els said he was expecting tough challenge form the local contingent, besides the top European players.         
	Jyoti has won here quite a few times and then you have Arjun, Shiv and Jeev. Besides, there are David Howell, Darren Clarke and some other international stars.         
	Els, who is into the twin business of wine making and course designing, is also eager to explore the Indian market.         
	I would love to export our labels here. Besides, designing a course here is also an exciting idea. All we need is a right piece of land and a right developer.

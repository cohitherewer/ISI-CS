The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No motorcade for victorious squad
                                                   No motorcade for victorious squad
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Dhoni and Co. may be the toast of India but the BCCI has decided to play down the reception for the Men in Blue. According to BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla, the proposed motorcade for the victorious Indian team on Thursday has been cancelled and only a public felicitation will be held at the Kotla. The function will be organised jointly by the BCCI and the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA).         
	Shukla said at news conference on Wednesday that the motorcade had been cancelled because of traffic congestion.         
	Moreover, the boys would be too tired after such a long tour, Shukla said. Delhi is a big city and all areas cannot be covered. People from different localities were requesting us to cover their areas. Since it cannot be done in such a short time, we decided to cancel the motorcade journey.         
	The Indian squad will arrive in Mumbai at 11am and will board a flight to Delhi where they will check into a hotel. The public reception will be held at Kotla at 3.30pm, said DDCA president Arun Jaitley.         
	The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and the city mayor will be present at the function. The chief minister wanted to be present but at the moment she is in Kerala.         
	Like it was in Mumbai during the reception of the Twenty20 squad, the public will be allowed to come and watch the function from the stands.         
	Shukla said all selectors, including the five for the juniors, will be given Rs 10 lakh each by the BCCI. He also announced that the UP Cricket Association would give cash awards to Praveen Kumar, Suresh Raina, Piyush Chawla and Tanmay Srivastava. While Praveen will be given Rs 5 lakh, Raina, Chawla and Srivastava will receive Rs 1 lakh each, said Shukla, who is also the secretary of the UPCA.

                                                   Ramiz: Imrans tune shows his double standards
  - Id be very disappointed if an appeals body overturns this punishment: Former captain       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                  Ramiz Raja    
	Calcutta: Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja, also a one-time chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), has welcomed the five-year ban slapped on the controversial Shoaib Akhtar.         
	Ramiz, who is in India on a TV assignment, spoke to The Telegraph from his Ahmedabad hotel on Wednesday evening.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Thoughts on the latest ban         
	Hailing from the same fraternity, I must say its sad when a cricketer has to be punished in this manner. However, Shoaib shot himself in the foot and theres nobody else to blame Something like this was waiting to happen and theres a very clear sequence to Shoaibs self-destruction He has always been a problem child where Pakistan cricket is concerned A lost cause for his backers.         
	Shoaib having the right to appeal         
	But I hope this ban isnt overturned A process has been followed The procedure has been respected and its not that one individual has banned him Id be very disappointed if an appeals body overturns this latest punishment.         
	Whether hed watched the TV interview where Shoaib tore into the PCB         
	Parts of it, yes Shoaib didnt use abusive language but his tone was definitely abusive He ridiculed the PCB and was most critical of the system What needs to be noted is that Shoaib has himself been a big under-performer and has missed many more matches than the number he has played in the past decade or so.         
	On whether the PCB shouldve been much tougher years ago         
	Well, the fact is that successive administrations have tried to build bridges Tried to get a relationship going with Shoaib But, as has been well documented, he has had his own ideas The PCB, clearly, gave him a long rope. Hed been on probation, but Id told you months ago that we hadnt seen the end of his misdeeds.         
	Whether Shoaib shouldve been banned for life (he got no more than a 13-match suspension) after he hit teammate Mohammed Asif in the lead-up to last Septembers World Twenty20 championship in South Africa         
	Absolutely Have you ever come across such an incident? I cant think of even one         
	Having tried to rein in Shoaib when he was the chief executive (from mid-2003 to mid-2004, when he quit)         
	I did, yes, which is why Shoaib doesnt like me I made him undergo those medical tests after the home series against India (early 2004) Im sorry to say but Ive never trusted him He has never come across as being straight and, in my book, is a bad role model and a bad advertisement for cricket. (After a pause) I remember, when I was captain years ago, he had to be dropped following an adverse report by the manager after an A tour Zaheer Abbas was probably the manager.         
	Greats like Imran Khan consistently backing Shoaib         
	Having played under Imran, I feel totally let down Feel gutted, really As captain, hed been firm on discipline and, once, even sent Abdul Qadir back from Australia on grounds of indiscipline Imran would never compromise on erratic behaviour and hed stand for principles Always Its sad that Pakistans greatest cricketer is now singing a different tune and is indulging in double standards Imran has politicised the ban You cant only look at the value a particular player could add, youve also got to look at what he brings to the dressing room (atmosphere) Obviously, support from some of the greats has emboldened Shoaib Imrans statements have definitely given him strength.         
	On Pakistans sports minister, Khawaja Asif, doing a U-turn and some newly-elected members of the national assembly also getting into the picture         
	Look, as Im not in Pakistan, it wouldnt be proper to comment on this question.         
	There being no bar on Shoaib turning out for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League (IPL)         
	Its ridiculous The PCB shouldve made it clear that it wouldnt allow him to play anywhere, not even in the IPL, where national teams arent involved Shoaib could use the IPL to gain sympathy Could project himself as a martyr. If youre banned, then youre banned everywhere Thats how I see it.         
	Finally, the lessons that need to be learnt         
	That the line simply cant be over-stepped and nobody is bigger than the game. Whatever the field, discipline has to matter more than talent.

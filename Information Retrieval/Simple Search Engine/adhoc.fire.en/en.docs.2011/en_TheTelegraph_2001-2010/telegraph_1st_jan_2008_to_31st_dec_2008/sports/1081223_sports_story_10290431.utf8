The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle century gives WI hope
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gayle century gives WI hope
                  Chris Gayle                     
	Wellington: The West Indies captain Chris Gayle scored a magnificent 146 to give his team a chance of a surprise victory at the close of the fourth day of the second Test against New Zealand in Napier on Monday.         
	At stumps the West Indies were 278 for seven in the second innings, an overall lead of 214 with one day to play with Gayle still at the crease alongside Fidel Edwards.         
	While New Zealand are still favoured to win the match, Gayles innings has given the tourists some hope, despite them being on the back foot for much of the game.         
	Gayle bludgeoned 13 fours and cleared the boundary six times during his innings for his first Test century in more than three years.         
	He shared a 126-run partnership with Brendan Nash (65), the pair coming together with the West Indies in deep trouble at 106 for four.         
	Gayles century was his eighth in Test cricket, but his first since he scored 317 against South Africa in April 2005. The West Indies captain, renowned for his aggressive batting, was forced into a more responsible innings after the loss of Shivnarine Chanderpaul for a duck.

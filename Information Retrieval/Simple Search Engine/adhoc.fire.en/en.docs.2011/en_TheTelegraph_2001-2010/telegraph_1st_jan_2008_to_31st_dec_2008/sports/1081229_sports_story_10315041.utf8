            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Rahul Dravid in action in Mumbai on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Karnataka relied on two fine rescue acts, one fashioned by former India captain Rahul Dravid and the other by allrounder Balachandra Akhil, to set Saurashtra an imposing target of 325 in the Ranji Trophy quarter finals at the Brabourne stadium here on Sunday.         
	Dravid hit a well-paced 52 to lead a top order recovery but Karnataka still needed Akhil to play a typical rear-guard innings of 56 to post 208 in their second innings on the third and penultimate day.         
	The former champions then priced out two early wickets to push Saurashtra on the back foot. Saurashtra were 10 for two at stumps.         
	Yet, for the most part of the day, it was Saurashtra who dominated the proceedings.         
	After separating the last pair of Balakrishna Jadeja and Jayesh Odedra quickly in the morning, Karnataka were sitting pretty on a lead of 116 runs. Saurashtra were dismissed for a paltry 189.         
	But Karnataka nearly blew it away when they were reduced to 137 for seven before tea break.         
	Dravid, who struggled in the first innings, was in fluent touch from the outset until mistiming a pull shot off Jobanputra. Lending Dravid vital support was C Raghu (41) as the two added 68 runs for the fourth wicket.         
	Summarised scores         
	 In Ahmedabad: HP 250 amp; 200/5 (P. Dogra 82 ..). Mumbai 495.         
	 In Mumbai: Karnataka 305 amp; 208 (Dravid 52, Akhil 56; S. Jobanputra 5/54, R. Jadeja 4/58). Saurashtra 189 amp; 10/2.         
	 In Vadodara: UP 305 amp; 285/8 (T. Srivastava 67; Parmer 4/93). Gujarat 117.         
	All matches to continue.

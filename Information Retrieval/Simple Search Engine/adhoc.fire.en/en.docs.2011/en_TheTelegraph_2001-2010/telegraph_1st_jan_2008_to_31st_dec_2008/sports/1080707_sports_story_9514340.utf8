  - ASIA CUP

	Karachi: Ajantha Mendis broke Indias back with a mesmerising six-wicket haul as Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup with a facile 100-run victory here on Sunday.         
	Chasing 274, Indias much-vaunted batting attack was bamboozled by Mendis bag of tricks and the mystery spinner emerged as the wrecker-in-chief to bundle out India for 173 in just 39.3 overs. Mendis bowling figures read an impressive 8-1-13-6. This was the first six-wicket haul in the Asia Cup history.         
	Indias ploy of having an additional batsman did not pay dividend and only Virender Sehwag (60 off 36) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (49) managed to salvage their reputation.         
	The Indian batsmen thus let down their bowling colleagues, who had earlier done a decent job by bowling out Sri Lanka for 273 in 49.5 overs, a total built around Sanath Jayasuriyas 125 off just 114 balls. Chaminda Vaas started the rot by removing Gautam Gambhir (6) in the fifth over before Mendis took over.         
	In his first over, Mendis foxed an onrushing Sehwag with a flicker to get him stumped and two balls later, he flicked another through Yuvraj Singhs gates to castle him for a duck. In his third over, Mendis disturbed Suresh Rainas (16) timbers before trapping Rohit Sharma (3) plumb in front four runs later.         
	In the 32nd over again, he scalped Irfan Pathan and R.P. Singh off success deliveries to complete his six-wicket haul.         
	Earlier, Jayasuriya looked unstoppable in a brilliant 125 runs from 114 balls that included nine fours and five sixes as he put on a face-saving 131-run stand for the fifth wicket with Tillekaratne Dilshan, who made 56.         
	India started well as Ishant Sharma rocked the top order with three wickets while R.P. Singh cleaned up the tail with as many, as Sri Lanka struggled to 57 in the last 10 overs.         
	Jayasuriyas 27th ODI hundred rescued Sri Lanka from a precarious 66 for four in 12 overs after India, in a brave decision, opted to field first. R.P. Singh suffered badly in the 16th over when a blitz from Jayasuriya produced 26 runs from six balls. He blasted Singh over the long off area for two sixes and then drove him for two fours with the final ball being dispatched over mid-wicket for another six.

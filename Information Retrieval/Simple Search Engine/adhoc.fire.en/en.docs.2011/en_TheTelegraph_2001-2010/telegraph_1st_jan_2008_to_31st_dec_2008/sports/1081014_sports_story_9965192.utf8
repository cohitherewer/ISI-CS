The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rain hits Mohali preparation
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rain hits Mohali preparation
    - The wicket definitely has moisture. However, some days remain, says Daljit             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Daljit Singh                                 
	Calcutta: Rain till as recently as October 4-5 has hampered the preparation of the Mohali wicket for the second Test against Australia, from Friday.         
	With the face-off in Bangalore ending in a draw, one can expect an all-out war in Test No.2 of the four-match series.         
	All the more attention, therefore, on the surface.         
	The late rain has come as a bit of a bother and, today, the wicket definitely has moisture. However, some days remain and Im praying that the surface offered will turn out to be a good one, said Daljit Singh, chairman of the grounds and pitches committee, both at the national (Board) and state (Punjab) levels.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Monday evening, he added: Weve stopped watering and are hoping that the sun will help dry the top layer of the wicket... The ferocity of the sun, though, has lessened and the day-time temperature has come down... As for the lower bit, were relying on transpiration.         
	Regarded as Indias Les Burdett, Daljit (who wore the big gloves for undivided Bihar and East Zone) explained that the surface had grass, which would be cut once the lower layer had dried. For transpiration, the wicket needs a covering of grass This needs to be understood.         
	He maintained that nobody should expect the surface to help spinners from Day One. I would never prepare such a wicket and, traditionally, that just hasnt been a Mohali characteristic.         
	Daljit continued: If everything goes well, you could look forward to a traditional surface... Seamer-friendly (initially) with bounce... There will be something there for the batsmen as well... Later, spinners are likely to come into play... In fact, its interesting to note that (Indias Test captain) Anil Kumble has been the MoM in two of the seven Tests staged by Mohali.         
	Both awards, incidentally, came against England  2001-02 (under Sourav Ganguly) and 2005-06 (when Rahul Dravid was the captain).         
	The wicket earmarked for the Test has already hosted a few matches, including the rain-affected four-day inter-district final between Chandigarh and Ludhiana, this season.         
	Its not going to be an untested surface... Because of the weather, the wicket during that inter-district final had been sluggish... But, then, that was some three weeks ago, pointed out Daljit.         
	The Australians, clearly, will be fancying their chances in Mohali. However, Zaheer Khan (MoM in the first Test) and Ishant Sharma would also be looking to make a statement on the traditionally seamer-friendly surface.         
	Having stunned Australia in Perth this year, Kumble and Co. neednt really lose sleep over the bounce-factor.         
	An aggressive captain would probably like to bat after winning the toss... Having said that, a captain may also wish to be aggressive by backing his bowlers and inserting the opposition The call is going to be interesting, remarked Daljit.         
	Actually, it wont surprise if the Team India think-tank actively considers fielding three new-ball bowlers for the maiden Test against Australia in Mohali.

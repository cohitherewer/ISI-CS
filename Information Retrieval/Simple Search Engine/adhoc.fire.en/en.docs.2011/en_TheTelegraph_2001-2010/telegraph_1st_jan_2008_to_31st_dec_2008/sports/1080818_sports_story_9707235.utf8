Michaels epic journey meets glorious end | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Michaels epic journey meets glorious end
            Karen Crouse                              
	Beijing: It was so surreal to be Michael Phelps here, to listen to people debate whether he is the greatest athlete in Olympic history after he passed a group that included the runners Carl Lewis and Paavo Nurmi to become the one with the most gold medals.         
	Phelps is a self-described klutz, a real fish out of water on land, and he has a surgical scar on his right wrist to prove it. In October he took a nasty stumble that imperilled his pursuit of Mark Spitzs single Games record of seven gold medals. Phelps, 23, slipped on a patch of ice and fell while climbing into a friends car in Michigan and broke his right wrist.         
	It made for a tough start to the training cycle that carried him through these Beijing Games, but the climax was perfect. On Sunday morning, Phelps swam the butterfly leg on the US 4x100-meter medley relay that held off Australia in a world record-setting victory, giving Phelps his eighth gold medal of these Games and his 14th over all.         
	I wanted to do something nobody ever did, Phelps said. This goes hand in hand with my goal of changing swimming.         
	Spitzs record lasted 36 years, and it figures to be even longer before the world sees Phelpss successor. In 1972, Spitz swam two strokes, the freestyle and the butterfly, and none of his swims covered more than 200 meters. Phelps swam all four strokes, at distances ranging from 100 to 400 meters, and faced three rounds in each of his five individual events, one more round than Spitz had.         
	Phelpss long-time coach, Bob Bowman, has been preparing him for this since Phelps made his first Olympic team, in the 200 butterfly, as a 15-year-old in 2000. In the beginning it seemed foolhardy, sending Phelps out to swim 17 races over nine days.         
	As time went on, one could see Bowmans vision crystallising. At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Phelps won six gold medals and two bronzes. Swimming the same program at the 2007 world championships, he won seven golds, missing a shot at an eighth when a relay he would have raced was disqualified in a preliminary heat.         
	These Games produced many unforgettable swims. With Phelps contributing to seven, 25 world records fell, 10 more than were broken at the 2007 world championships in Melbourne, Australia. The pool was conducive to fast times. It was three meters, or 10 feet, deep, with two empty lanes on either side serving as buffers to keep waves from ricocheting. The new corset-like suits, which shoehorn the swimmers bodies into more streamlined positions, also had a role in the record assault.         
	Not to be overlooked is the psychological component. When one swimmer achieves what was once unthinkable, be it Phelps breaking 1 minute 43 seconds in the 200-meter freestyle or 4:04 in the 400-meter individual medley, it makes every barrier suddenly look vulnerable.         
	As the meet went on, the otherworldliness of Phelpss performance found expression in other swimmers tales. In the mens 50 freestyle final on Saturday, the goggles of Eamon Sullivan, the Australian world-record holder, filled with water on his dive and he never recovered, finishing sixth.         
	In the third of Phelpss five individual events, the 200-meter butterfly on Wednesday, his goggles were leaking so badly he could not see the ends of the pool. Counting his strokes to gauge where the walls were, he won and shaved six-hundredths of a second off his 17-month-old world record.         
	Phelps was absolutely to the point of despair after the fracture was discovered in his wrist last fall. Bowman said that when they talked immediately after the accident, Phelps was as upset as Bowman had ever seen him. He was devastated, Bowman said. He kept saying, Its over. Im finished.         
	The bad circumstance ended up doing Phelps a world of good. For a few weeks after the surgery, Phelps was confined to kicking in the pool with a kickboard while his team mates swam. All that kicking strengthened Phelpss legs, which was like a fish growing more gills.         
	Phelps was already blessed with a killer kick, but his added strength was evident on the turns in his races here and at the finish of the 100 butterfly, his seventh event.         
	With his victory in the 100 butterfly, Phelps tied Spitzs record. Swimming the third leg of Sundays relay, Phelps propelled the Americans to first place from third, adding to his legend.         
	The team of Aaron Peirsol, Hansen, Phelps and Jason Lezak was timed in 3:29.34, 1.34 seconds faster than the 4-year-old world record, set by the US at the Athens Games, and 0.70 of a second ahead of Australia. On the freestyle leg, Lezaks split of 46.76  0.70 of a second slower than his gallant effort in the 4x100 freestyle  was enough to hold off Sullivan.         
	With 16 overall Olympic medals, Phelps is behind only the former Soviet gymnast Laryssa Latynina, who has the most, with 18 over three Games.         
	This is all a dream come true, he said. Doing all best times. Winning every race. Everything was accomplished that I wanted to do. Its been one fun week, thats for sure.         
	Throughout this journey, Phelps has insisted he was not following Spitzs footsteps but forging his own path. I want to be the first Michael Phelps, not the second Mark Spitz, he has said repeatedly.         
	Before travelling here from Baltimore, Phelpss mother, Debbie, received a letter from Barbara Kines, who had taught Phelps in the third grade.         
	Before he found an outlet for his abundant energy in swimming, Phelps had immense difficulties concentrating and sitting still, leading one of his grade-school teachers to wonder if he would ever be able to focus on anything.         
	Kines, recalling those days, wrote about how proud she was of Phelps and how, perhaps, it had never been focus he lacked, but, rather, a goal worthy of his focus.         
	The only loss Phelps sustained all week was for words. Ive been speechless, he said. How could he explain all that he was feeling? If you dream as big as you can dream, he said, anything is possible.

	Phelps comes from a broken home in Baltimore. His policeman father Fred and school teacher mother Debbie separated when he was only seven. Elder sister Whitney, also a swimmer, has written that she used the swimming pool as a refuge from the yelling.   
	When he was 10, Phelps attended the 1996 Olympic trials to support sister Whitney. She finished sixth in the 200m butterfly final and failed to make the team.The family cried in the stands.Whitney rsquo;s career was cut short by four herniated discs.   
	In December 2004, Phelps was sentenced to 18 months probation after failing a drink driving test.A judge ordered him to abstain totally from alcohol and illegal drugs during his probation and attend a victim impact panel meeting. sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving.   
	When Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe said he did not think anyone could win eight races at a single Olympics, Phelps memorised the quote to motivate him for Beijing.He hung a poster of Ian Crocker above his bed after his team mate beat him at the 2003 World Championships, to help motivate him for Athens.   
	Phelps listens to hip hop and rap to help him get focused before a race, downloading tracks on his MP3 player.Among his favourites is American rapperYoung Jeezy. He has an unusual physique with a long torso and comparatively short legs, providing minimal resistance in the water.  
	 He consumes 12,000 calories every day and trains 96 km every week.   
	His sister Whitney was a member of the USWorld Championship team in 2005.   
	Phelps is the most successful Olympian of all time with a career tally of 14 golds, five more than anyone else.   
	He broke fellow American Mark Spitz rsquo;s 1972 record of seven wins at a single Games.

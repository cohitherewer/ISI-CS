	Washington: The Beckham mania that surrounded the Major League Soccer season in 2007 is noticeably absent this year and MLS commissioner Don Garber said on Tuesday that the league would not hype its biggest name. David Beckhams arrival last year as the newest member of the Los Angeles Galaxy was hailed with the fanfare of a conquering hero.    
	The splash happened on its own, Garber said in an interview, referring to the media frenzy. It was a phenomenon. It said a lot about the sport that David decided to play here. It became a story bigger than we ever expected. And it now its, well, (just) a story.    
	The new MLS season opens this week without the hysteria the 32-year-old English midfielder created a year ago.         
	Madrid: Barcelona president Joan Laporta has moved to quash speculation about a rift between the club and an out-of-form Ronaldinho. There is no divorce between Barcelona and Ronaldinho, Laporta was quoted as saying by Spanish media on Wednesday. We hope Ronaldinho will be back as soon as possible, but at the moment he is suffering some pain and we have to respect that. While he has got this pain we cant count on him.    
	A succession of injury and fitness problems and media speculation about night-time partying have led to reports that Barcelona are prepared to offload the former World Player of the Year at the end of the season. But Laporta insisted that the 28-year-old Brazilian was still part of coach Frank Rijkaards plans.        
	Manchester: Manchester United captain Gary Neville may not return to first-team action until next season. The fullback, who has not appeared in the Premier League for almost a year because of ankle and groin injuries, has started playing for the Red Devils reserve team but expects a long wait before he gets back in the Premier League leaders first-choice line-up.    
	Its going to take time for me to get back to full match sharpness after being out for so long, Neville said. Hopefully Ill get a game somewhere but that could prove difficult with the significance of the matches we have over the next few weeks. I just have to hope and pray that I get my chance at some point.        
	London: Wimbledon will continue to be shown on free television in Britain through 2014 after the BBC signed a new five-year contract. The British Broadcasting Corps latest agreement, announced on Wednesday, incorporates exclusive live rights for TV, radio and Internet, and stretches the companys association with the grass court tournament to 87 years. It comes into force in 2010, after the current deal ends. Neither the All England Club nor the BBC disclosed the amount paid for the rights.        
	Sydney: Eamon Sullivan came agonisingly close to breaking the 100m freestyle world record at the Australian Olympic trials on Wednesday. The 22-year-old stopped the clock at 47.52 seconds, just 0.02 outside the world record set by Alain Bernard of France at the European championships last weekend. Sullivan now owns two of the fastest three times in history after winning his semi-final in 47.55 on Tuesday.    
	Jessicah Schipper also weakened on the last lap to fall 1.42 short of her own world record for the womens 200 butterfly. The 21-year-old was under world record pace at each of the three turns but ran out of energy to win in 2:06.82.         
	London: Every British athlete competing in the Beijing Olympics will be dope tested at least once before this years Games as part of the countrys most comprehensive pre-Olympic testing programme, UK Sport announced on Wednesday.

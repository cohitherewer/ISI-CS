	Margao: Resolute defending coupled with superior keeping by Karanjit Singh helped JCT down defending champions Dempo 2-1 in the ONGC I-League at Nehru stadium here Sunday.         
	JCT who led 1-0 at half time scored through Edward Silva (16th) and Balwant Singh (64th).         
	Dempo who dominated the entire game narrowed the margin through substitute Nicolau Borges (78th).         
	JCTs Anwar who played his heart out in defence was declared Man of the Match.         
	It was not Dempos day although they dominated the game, especially in the second half, creating several goal-scoring chances. But they either failed to find the net or could not get past Karanjit Singh who effected some smart saves.         
	Dempo, who started in right earnest, probing the rival half mostly from the left, could have taken an early lead in the 4th minute when Ranty Martins was found open in the box. But he drove the ball wide off a pass from Roberto da Silva.Minutes later Anthony Fernandes drove the ball straight into the hands of Karanjit Singh.         
	Dempo, who kept the JCT defence on their toes, came close to taking the lead in the 15th minute. Roberto Silva received a pass from Valeriano Rebello in the middle, sprinted into the box, and let go a left-footer which missed the target by a whisker.         
	JCT, busy defending for most of the match, scored in the 16th minute off a counter attack. Daljit Singh worked his way through the right and lobbed the ball to Edward de Silva who chested it before uncorking a low shot that found the far corner of the net.Dempo made two changes in the second half bringing in Satish Kumar to replace an injured Abhijit Mondal and Nicolau Borges for an off-colour Clifford Miranda.         
	Dempo missed a chance in the 52nd minute when Climax Lawrences bi-cycle kick hit the bar after brushing against Karanjit Singh.         
	With the entire team moving forward in search of an equaliser, Dempos defence was left exposed and JCT punished them, scoring their second goal in the 64th minute.         
	Baljit Sahni played a through ball to an unmarked Balwant Singh who raced into the box and, seeing keeper Satish Kumar leaving his line, deftly placed his shot into the net.         
	Dempo continued to press hard for a goal and virtually camped in the rival box for the last quarter. They finally managed to pull one back in the 78th minute.         
	Roberto, who impressed in mid-field, floated a cross to substitute Nicolau Borges who controlled the ball before sending a low drive past Karanjit Singh. (PTI)

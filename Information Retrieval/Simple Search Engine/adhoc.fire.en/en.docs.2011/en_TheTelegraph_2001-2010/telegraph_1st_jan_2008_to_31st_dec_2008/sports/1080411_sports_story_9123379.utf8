The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A1 catching up with F1, says Narain
                                                                                                                                                                                                       A1 catching up with F1, says Narain
                  Narain Karthikeyan                     
	Shanghai: For motor sports enthusiasts, Formula One may be the Real McCoy but ace Indian driver Narain Karthikeyan believes the A1 Grand Prixs six-year deal with Ferrari will give F1 a run for its money.         
	Here for the penultimate A1 race of the season at the Shanghai International Circuit this weekend, Karthikeyan said that A1 was catching up with Formula One and would gain more popularity in the years to come.         
	I think so (that A1 will catch up with F1), more so for the next year, because of the Ferrari deal. Ferrari and motor sport go a long way in history. Nowhere in the world do 24 nations battle in Ferrari cars. (The A1) championship straightaway goes high profile. It will have much more media attention and more viewers, Karthikeyan said on Thursday.         
	Karthikeyan said the A1 GPs unique format of pitting country against country and the deal with Ferrari would herald a new era for motor sport in a country like India.         
	They (A1) dont go and try competing with F1. Its two totally different levels. This concept is really clicking with the fans. It will get much bigger in the years to come, he said.         
	The plan is to get A1 to India by 2009-10 thats the date they have set. Hopefully A1 GP will be there with all the Ferrari cars, he said. (PTI)

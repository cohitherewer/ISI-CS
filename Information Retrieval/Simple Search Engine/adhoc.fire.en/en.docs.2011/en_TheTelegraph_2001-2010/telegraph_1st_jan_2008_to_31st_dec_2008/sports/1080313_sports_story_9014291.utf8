	Dhaka: A.B. de Villiers hit an unbeaten half-century to steer South Africa to a seven-wicket victory over Bangladesh and an unassailable 2-0 lead in their one-day series Wednesday.         
	J.P. Duminy added an unbeaten 49 for a 119-run fourth wicket partnership to seal the three-match series. South Africa beat Bangladesh by nine wickets in the first one-dayer in Chittagong Sunday.         
	Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak took two for 32, while pacer Mashrafe Mortaza got the other wicket for 27.         
	Despite losing early wickets and playing under pressure from spin bowlers, South Africa faced an easy target of 174. Opener Herschelle Gibbs (three) was trapped lbw by Mortaza in the fifth over with score at 13.         
	The second wicket of the innings fell when Hashim Amla was caught and bowled by Razzak on 16 in the 13th over. Captain Graeme Smith (28) was the next to return to the dressing room when he was bowled by Razzak.         
	De Villiers played 112 balls, hitting two boundaries and a six to confirm the victory, sealed off a delivery from the casual spinner Tamim Iqbal.         
	Earlier Roqibul Hassan and Shakib Al Hasan had hit half-centuries as a struggling Bangladesh reached 173.         
	South Africas pacer Andre Nel finished for four for 27 and Charl Langeveldt took three for 31 to bundle out the hosts.         
	Johan Botha took one for 47 and the two other batsmen were run out, leaving South Africa with a small target to clinch the series.         
	Bangladesh opted to bat after captain Mohammed Ashraful won the toss, but the hosts were in tatters after they lost four wickets for 18 runs.         
	Opener Iqbal was bowled by Nel in the third ball of the innings for a duck.         
	Roqibul joined Shakib for a fifth-wicket partnership and halted the wicket falling streak momentarily. Roqibul (63) hit his maiden one-day half century and Shakib (52) got his sixth one-day fifty.         
	They built up a Bangladesh record for a fifth-wicket partnership of 119 runs, beating the previous mark of 116 runs by Shakib (Al Hasan) and Ashraful against Canada in 2007.         
	Roqibul was caught by Smith at mid on off Langeveldt and Bangladesh lost wickets regularly after that, ending their innings with one over and four balls to spare.         
	Shakib was caught by Herschelle Gibbs at cover off Botha. Mortaza was caught by Paul Harris at extra cover off Langeveldt on 20.         
	The third and final one-dayer will be played in Dhaka Friday.           (REUTERS)

	Calcutta: Harendra Gupta, the winner of PGTIs last event in Chandigarh, continued his good form to share the lead (three-under 33) with Noidas Sanjay Singh after the opening round of the PGTI Players Championship at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) on Wednesday.         
	Rahil Gangjee, Ashok Kumar, Neil Mundra and Chiragh Kumar were one stroke behind the joint leaders in tied third position after the first round was reduced to nine holes due to bad weather. Reigning Indian Masters champion S.S.P. Chowrasia had a decent outing as he carded 35 for a share of the seventh place. The Calcutta-lad made birdies on the fourth and ninth and a bogey on the seventh.         
	Chandigarh-lad Gupta sank birdies on the third, fourth, eighth and ninth holes. He had only one blemish on his card, a bogey on the sixth.         
	I had a great round today (Wednesday) even though I did not find it easy to assess the speed of the greens due to lack of practice on this course, Gupta said. He said he was confident of at least a top-five finish in the tournament. The wind was strong, it was very important to hit straight. Maybe playing late today (Wednesday) was an advantage as the course had dried out a bit in the afternoon.         
	Noida-based professional Sanjay Singhs round was marked by birdies on the first and fifth, a bogey on the seventh and an eagle on the par five eighth.         
	It was the best round of the season so far. My hitting was not good but I made some difficult putts. It was one of those days when I did not play all that well but ended up with a good score, Singh said.         
	City-lad Gangjees round included birdies on the first, fourth, eighth and a bogey on the sixth. Ashok Kumar, the 2006-07 PGTI Order of Merit winner, birdied the third, fourth, eighth and bogeyed the seventh to stay in the hunt.         
	Chowrasia, who was quite satisfied with Wednesdays performance said: It feels great to play a professional tournament on my home course after a long gap, even though I missed a few relatively simple birdie chances.

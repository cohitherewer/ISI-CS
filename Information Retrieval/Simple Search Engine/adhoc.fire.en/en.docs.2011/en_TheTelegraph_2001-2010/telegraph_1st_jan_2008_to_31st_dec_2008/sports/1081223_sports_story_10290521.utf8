                                                                                                                                                                                                     ICC to assess security situation in Pakistan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will carry out an independent security assessment before allowing its match officials to supervise in Pakistan for the proposed home series against Sri Lanka early next year.         
	Addressing a press conference here on Monday, ICC chief executive officer Haroon Lorgat said: We will do an independent assessment of the situation there, for the safety of the match officials. After all we would be appointing the match officials.         
	Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) agreed to step in after the Indian government refused permission for the team to tour Pakistan due to strained bilateral relations following last months terror strikes in Mumbai.         
	Major teams have refused to tour Pakistan this year over player safety fears and the ICC postponed the September Champions Trophy until late next year with the venue to be confirmed.         
	Asked whether Sri Lanka were risking the safety of their players by sending them to Pakistan, the ICC official said: Im convinced that the Sri Lankan board will do everything to ascertain whether its safe or not and seek assurance from the Pakistan Cricket Board.         
	Lorgat said the ICC was keen to see the resumption of international cricket in Pakistan. The fate of the Champions Trophy, he said, will be determined in the January meeting of the ICC in Perth.         
	Regarding Champions Trophy, we have to see the reality and the board would determine the fate at its January meeting.         
	Indias tour of Pakistan could have provided us huge inputs for the Champions Trophy but now that it has been cancelled, Sri Lankas tour of Pakistan might provide us that, he said.

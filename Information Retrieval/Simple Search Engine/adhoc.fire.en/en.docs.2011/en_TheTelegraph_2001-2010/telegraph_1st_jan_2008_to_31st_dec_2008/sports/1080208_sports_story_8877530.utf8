                                                Kanitkars regret
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India left-hander Hrishikesh Kanitkar feels that batting down the order cut short his international career.         
	I always had to bat down the order, at No. 7 Always in the last couple of overs of the match when there were little time to settle down, Kanitkar said on Thursday.         
	The 33-year-old from Maharashtra is in the city to lead Air India in The Telegraph McDowells No. 1 Twenty20 meet at the CC amp;FC.         
	I always loved to bat up the order. But batsmen like Mohammed Azharuddin, Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and others used to come ahead of me.

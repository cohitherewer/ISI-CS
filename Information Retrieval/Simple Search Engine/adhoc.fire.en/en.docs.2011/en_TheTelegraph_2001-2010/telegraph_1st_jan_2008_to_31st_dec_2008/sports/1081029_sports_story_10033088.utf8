The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger to play against US
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Roger to play against US
                      
	Geneva: Roger Federer ended the speculation over his Davis Cup plans on Tuesday and announced he will play for Switzerland against the US next March.         
	It will be the first time in five years that the 13-time Grand Slam singles winner has broken up his early season schedule for the Davis Cup.         
	I am excited to once again join my fellow Swiss teammates, who I have a great friendship with, Federer said on his official website. I look forward to what I am sure will be a tough weekend.         
	The World Group first-round series will be played March 6-8 in the US at a venue to be chosen by the United States Tennis Association in the next six weeks.         
	Federer helped Switzerland rejoin the elite World Group when they beat Belgium last month.         
	He beat Kristof Vliegen in straight sets, then teamed up with Stanislas Wawrinka, his Olympic doubles gold medal-winning partner in Beijing, to win their doubles match.         
	Federer last played a Davis Cup first-round match in 2004, a victory over Romania in Bucharest.         
	We are obviously very pleased that he decided he will be joining the team, Swiss Tennis spokeswoman Sandra Perez said. That increases our chances.         
	Switzerland and the US have a 1-1 record in Davis Cup meetings.           (AP)

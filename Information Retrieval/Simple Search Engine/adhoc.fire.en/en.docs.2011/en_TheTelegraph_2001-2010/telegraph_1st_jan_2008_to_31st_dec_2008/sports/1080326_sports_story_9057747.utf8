	Calcutta: Oliver Barbosa of the Philippines held top seed Krishnan Sasikiran to a draw in the second round of the Calcutta Open Grandmasters Chess Tournament at Gorky Sadan on Tuesday. On a day of upsets, GM Koneru Humpy, too, could not penetrate the defences of IM S. Satyapragyan in a Ragozin Defence.         
	Sasikiran, playing white, obtained a superior position from the opening in a Slav Defence and won a rook for a knight in the middlegame. But he went astray in the ending, allowing his opponent to draw by perpetual checks.         
	IM Ponnuswamy Konguvel outwitted GM Alberto David of Luxemburg with black in a Sicilian Dragon. Konguvel obtained a passed pawn on the h-file in a queen and rook versus queen and rook ending which proved decisive.         
	M.S. Thejkumar defeated GM Abdulla Al-Rakib in a sharp game that came from a Queens Gambit and 15-year-old Bitan Banerjee held GM Eshan Ghaem Maghami in a Benko Gambit.         
	World junior champion Adly Ahmed of Egypt also had to settle for a draw against Akshayraj Kore of India after a protracted struggle which ended after 67 moves. Arghyadip Das held GM Sandipan Chanda with black in a closed Sicilian.

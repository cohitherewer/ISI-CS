                                                                                                                                                                                                       3 golds for India in boxing 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT             Kalpana Choudhury                           
	Guwahati: Kalpana Choudhury kept her tryst with destiny, M.C. Mary Kom and India missed theirs.         
	The culmination of the 4th ASBC Asian Women Boxing at the Karmabir Nabin Chandra Bordoloi Indoor Stadium Sunday night threw up more than just the results, as defending champions India paved the way for China and DPR Korea in the overall medals race, and saw the birth of a champion in Kalpana who won her first official gold medal.         
	It also saw the unmaking of a champion in Mary Kom whose form  or the lack of it  took its toll in the final. The two-year layoff from competitive boxing was clearly showing in the ring.         
	Those following Mary Koms career asserted that form was temporary, class permanent the upset loss to Jong of DPR Korea 4-1 in the pinweight (46kg) final a temporary setback given her talent and determination. After a levelled 1-1 start in the first round, the reigning world champion conceded two quick points in the second round. Despite her best she could not manage to come back in the third and eventually conceded one more point.         
	The loss, however, did not have any visible impact on teammate Kalpana. In a combined display of form, determination and talent, the Assam girl prevailed over Ngo Thi Phuong of Vietnam to win the gold with a convincing margin of 2-10 playing from the blue corner in the light flyweight (48kg) final.         
	Though she had won a number of international medals in unofficial meets, including gold, this was Kalpanas first-ever Asian as well as international gold and the second official medal of her career.         
	Choudhury, who had upset defending champion Ri Jong Hyang of DPR Korea 3-1 in the semi-finals Saturday, was adjudged the best boxer of the meet.         
	L Sarita Devi, overcame her strong Chinese opponent Ren Cancan to bag gold for India in the light bantamweight (52 kg) category, by virtue of a better individual score. The final bout ended in a 5-5 tie and the Manipur boxer, who played from the blue corner, won 10-12.         
	Nagisetty Usha bagged the third gold for India beating Imanbayeva Zhuldzay of Kazakhstan 1-7 in the featherweight (57kg) final.         
	The five other Indian finalists, apart from Mary Kom, who had to be content with silver included Pavitra in bantamweight (54kg), Kavita Goyat in welterweight (66 kg), Renu Gora in middleweight (75 kg), last two editions champion Lekha KC in light heavyweight (80 kg) and Kavita Chahal in heavyweight (86 kg). Seema Devi Yadav was the only bronze medallist from India losing to Jang Un Hui of DPR Korea 4-15.

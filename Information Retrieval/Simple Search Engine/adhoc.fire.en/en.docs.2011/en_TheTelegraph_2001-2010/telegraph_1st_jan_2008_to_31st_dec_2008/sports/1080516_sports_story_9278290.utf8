	New Delhi: Unsung leg-spinner Amit Mishra came up with a spectacular hattrick in the last over as Delhi DareDevils returned to winning ways in a 10th round IPL at the Kotla Thursday.         
	With Deccan Chargers raising visions of giving a good chase to the DareDevils score of 194 for four, Mishra turned out to be the stumbling block for the fearsome Hyderabad batsmen, who launched an all out attack from the very beginning.         
	Mishra, who gave two crucial blows in the middle overs by removing Afridi (33 in 14 balls) and Gibbs (22) in the middle overs, made the biggest impact towards the end to give his team a 12-run win.         
	The Chargers were 180 for six at the end of the 19th over and everyone hoped for a nail-biting finish. But Mishra had other ideas as he removed Ravi Teja, Pragyan Ojha and RP Singh in the first three deliveries of the dramatic final over. This was Deccans eighth defeat in the tournament.         
	Mishra joined Laxmipathy Balaji (Chennai Super Kings) to take the second hattrick of the tournament.         
	The Chargers started the chase in great fashion as Adam Gilchrist and Afridi struck 20 runs in the first two overs before the Australian was sent back by compatriot Glen McGrath.         
	Thereafter, Afridi, Gibbs and Rohit Sharma kept on the run chase but for Mishras guile. The young spinner first removed an increasingly dangerous Afridi, and then got rid of Gibbs to break the backbone of the Chargers innings.         
	Enjoying a fabulous run in the tournament, Rohit looked set to take on the rival bowlers. But he was bowled around the legs by Farvez Mahroof to bring an end to Hyderabads chances.         
	Later, Venugopal Rao made some effort to revive the innings but he never looked like a serious contender to turn the match around.         
	Earlier, the Delhi top order once again came good to pile up 194 for four against a toothless bowling attack that could offer little resistance to inform batsmen like Gautam Gambhir and Shikhar Dhawan.         
	The two Delhi left-handers, who failed in their last match against Kolkata Knight Riders, left a lasting impact on the cheering spectators with a 133-run second wicket partnership after skipper Virender Sehwag was dismissed in the first over.         
	Though Sehwags exit came as a big relief for Deccan Chargers, their joy was shortlived as Gambhir and Dhawan launched on onslaught that resulted in both the batsmen racing to half centuries in no time. While Gambhir slammed 79 in 48 deliveries with the help of seven fours and three well struck sixes, Dhawan remained unbeaten on 68.

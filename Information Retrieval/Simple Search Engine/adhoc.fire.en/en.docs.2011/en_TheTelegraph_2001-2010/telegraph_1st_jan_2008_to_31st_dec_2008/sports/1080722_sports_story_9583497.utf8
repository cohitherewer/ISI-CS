The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gawli to sit out versus Malaysia
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gawli to sit out versus Malaysia
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                        Mahesh  Gawli              
	New Delhi: Injury worries continue to bother India on the eve of their friendly match against Malaysia at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in Hyderabad on Tuesday.         
	According to team sources, at least two of India s first eleven players are likely to miss the tie, which would be Indias last practice match before they start their campaign in the AFC Challenge Cup beginning from July 30.         
	While midfielder Steven Dias, considered a key factor in the Indian attack, is yet to recover from his ankle injury, stopper back Mahesh Gawli is also expected to be sit out because of an injury he suffered during the practice.         
	The coaching staff, however, was confident that Gawli would be fit in the next few days.         
	In the absence of experienced Gawli, young Gourmangi Singh, who had a great tournament in the Nehru Cup last year, is likely to be drafted in. He will pair up with Anwar as the two stopper backs, while Surkumar Singh will make a return to the side along with Deepak Mondal as the two side-backs.         
	Steven Diass place will be taken over by Bungo Singh. The good news for the Indians is that the conditions of the pitch at the Shastri Stadium has improved a lot in the last few days. National coach Bob Houghton was reportedly unhappy with the ground condition and since then the organisers have worked hard to give it a facelift.         
	India will play all their three quarter final league matches in the Challenge Cup at the Shastri Stadium.         
	The Malaysians, ranked 164 in the Fifa rankings, arrived on Sunday and have come with their best available squad.         
	India , who are ranked 153, are expected to win but given the fluctuating form that the home team displayed in the Saff Cup, the fans would keep their fingers crossed till the final whistle.

                                                   Anand loses to Radjabov

           
	Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): Rude defeats for world champion Viswanthan Anand and fellow Grandmaster Koneru Humpy summed up a pathetic day for the Indians in the first round of Corus Chess tournament here. 
    
	Hot favourite for the crown with his enviable record on the Dutch soil, Anand was in for a surprise against in-form Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan as the latter showcased his deep preparation and technical acumen to romp home in the A group. 
    
	Radjabov, along with Magnus Carlsen of Norway and Levon Aronian of Armenia, emerged as the early leaders in this category-20 tournament with victories in the opener. 
    
	While Carlsen put up a fine show to beat Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan, former world champion Veselin Topalov was comprehensively beaten by Aronian. The remaining games of the 14 players round-robin event ended in draws. In the B group GM Humpy did not get many chances against Jan Smeets of Holland. 
    
	Playing black Humpy slowly put on the defence of her queenside and faced an uphill task when Smeets gave two pieces for a rook.

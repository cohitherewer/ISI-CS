The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal avoid relegation 
                                                     East Bengal avoid relegation 
  - I-League Viva Kerala, Salgaocar demoted; Dempos title fate hangs in the balance                         East Bengal scorers (from top): Nabi, Alvito and Edmilson                             
	Kozhikode: East Bengal confirmed their right to stay in the ONGC I-League in style, thumping Viva Kerala 3-1 in their penultimate round on Sunday.         
	Syed Rahim Nabi, Alvito DCunha and Edmilson scored for Manoranjan Bhattacharjees side, helping them clear the cloud of relegation over them.         
	With Sundays win, their fifth overall, the three-time champions took their tally to 18 points from 17 matches, which meant Viva Kerala (12) and Salgaocar (11) were now relegated from the top tier of the countrys premier club competition. Sweetening further their victory, East Bengal also moved into the sixth place in the ten-team table.         
	The air, however, still remained unclear in the championship race, Salgaocar holding leaders Dempo SC to a 1-1 draw in Margao.         
	The draw puts Dempo on equal footing with Churchill Brothers at 33 points from 17 matches, but the former have a better goal difference. Dempo will take on Viva Kerala while Churchill will host Air India in their respective final round matches.         
	The hosts went into the match needing nothing but a win to keep their survival hopes alive. Consequently, they went on the offensive right from the word go, leaving their backline exposed to counter-moves from the rivals end.         
	Nabi took full advantage of Viva Keralas fragile defence, putting the visitors ahead in the 20th minute.         
	Stung by the setback, Viva Kerala upped their ante and duly equalised on the stroke of half-time, Ebin Rose heading in off a cross from K.V. Lalu.         
	After the break, East Bengal took control of the midfield battle, Man of the Match Nabi linking superbly between the half-line and the attacking third.         
	Nabi was the brain behind East Bengals second goal in the 57th minute, his pass from the middle set Alvito clear on the break and the latter finishing without trouble.         
	The hosts still had their chances, keeping the East Bengal defence on tenterhooks, but Subrata Paul under the bar was excellent, thwarting a couple of acrobatic saves.         
	Viva Keralas fate was finally sealed minutes before the final whistle when Brazilian striker Edmilson came up with the best goal of the day, neatly connecting a free-kick by Alvito.         
	In Margao, Salgaocar took the lead in the 29th minute through Joe Rodrigues. But Dempo soon found their rhythm and restored parity in the 37th minute via Ranty Martins.         
	Salgaocar goalkeeper Markus Basumatari effected at least four extraordinary saves to deny Dempo full points.         
	Both the Goa outfits started on an attacking note. Salgaocar, who held midfield superiority, probed more into the rival half with Fabio spearheading the attack.         
	They could have taken the lead in the ninth minute but S. Malsawmtluangas shot from inside the box, off a cross by Bevan DMello, was saved by Dempo keeper Abhijit Mondal.         
	Salgaocars persistent efforts bore fruit when a move on the left flank saw Beevan back pass to Rodrigues, who essayed a 30-yard shot that caught Mondal on the wrong foot and found the net.         
	The goal was a wake up call for Dempo, who regrouped immediately.         
	Johnny DCruz, who replaced injured Anthony Pereira, lobbed the ball to Ranty. The latter uncorked an angular shot that gave no chance to the Salgaocar goalie.           (AGENCIES)

	Melbourne: Novak Djokovic stood toe-to-toe with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and soaked up everything the Muhammad Ali of tennis could throw at him before delivering a knock-out blow to clinch the Australian Open title on Sunday.         
	Tsonga, nicknamed Ali for his resemblance to the former heavyweight boxing champion, was the crowd favourite to win his first Grand Slam but Djokovic was too solid and too steely and it was the Serb who snatched his first major title 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6.         
	First, before I thank everybody in this world, I want to thank everybody in my box, whove supported me all the way through, not just these two weeks, all the way in my life, Djokovic said. Thank you very much, I love you.         
	Second of course Jo. Unbelievable tournament and you should be proud of yourself  if he won tonight it would be absolutely deserved, so well done for his success.         
	Djokovic, who has had a hot and cold relationship with the Melbourne Park crowd, won them back over again in his post-match speech.         
	I know the crowd wanted him to win more, he said of Tsonga. Thats okay, its alright. I still love you guys, dont worry.         
	I am very happy to have won my first Grand Slam here, the third seed said, smiling at the crowd. I hope to see you here in this position many times more.         
	Djokovic was the youngest player since Stefan Edberg defeated Mats Wilander in 1985 to win the Australian title and the first man from Serbia to win a major.         
	I want to thank all the Serbian fans who came here to support me  I am so proud to be the first Serbian to win a Grand Slam title. I think it will be crazy house back in Serbia right now.         
	Monica Seles won three Australian Open titles while competing under the Yugoslav flag from 1991-1993.         
	Unseeded Tsonga came out swinging, needing 49 minutes to clinch the opener.         
	Tsonga, ranked 38th coming into his fifth major, will move up to No. 18 after advancing past the fourth round for the first time. He was aiming to be the first Frenchman in 80 years to win the Australian title and the first to win any of the four Grand Slams since Yannick Noahs win at Roland Garros in 1983.         
	Djokovic had dealt with world No. 1 Roger Federer in the semi-finla but initially he could not out-muscle his burly opponent.         
	Tsonga crunched aces and slammed winners, taking the match to the world No. 3 and keeping him on his heels.         
	But Djokovic is a determined character and kept gunning away.         
	His reward came in the seventh game of the second set. Djokovic earned a break point when he belted a backhand return past the Frenchman and dictated the next point before Tsonga sent a forehand wide.

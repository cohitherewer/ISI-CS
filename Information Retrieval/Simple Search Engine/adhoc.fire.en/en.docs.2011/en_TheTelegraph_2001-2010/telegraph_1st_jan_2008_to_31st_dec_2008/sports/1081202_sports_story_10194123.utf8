The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lawson hits out at England
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lawson hits out at England

	Sydney: Englands cricketers were guilty of employing double-standards for quitting their tour of India because of security fears, former Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson said on Monday.         
	Lawson, who was sacked by the Pakistan Cricket Board in October, urged Englands players to return to India and complete the series, citing the case of the 2005 Ashes series in England that went ahead despite bombings in London.         
	Its interesting that England are heading home and certain players dont want to play the Test series and yet we go back to 2005, bombs went off in London while there was a big series on there and it didnt affect one iota the cricket, Lawson told a Sydney radio station.         
	I think a few of the England players should reflect on what happened in their country before they start pulling out of cricket matches in India.         
	Englands players returned home last week during the attacks in Mumbai, abandoning the last two matches of their seven game ODI series.         
	They are awaiting security reports before deciding whether they will return for the scheduled Test series but Lawson said they should.         
	If you stop events that arent particularly and directly threatened youre just succumbing to terrorism and they succeed, Lawson said.         
	So far, the facts are, no sporting event, let alone a cricket event, has ever been threatened.         
	Lawson, who was highly critical of his native Australia when they refused to tour Pakistan earlier this year, also called on the International Cricket Council to proceed with plans to play the 2011 World Cup on the subcontinent amid media speculation it may be moved to Australia and New Zealand.         
	No matter where you hold that event in the cricket world it could be open to terrorism, Lawson said.         
	Whether its going to be Christchurch or Alice Springs, its not really going to matter. If they want to do something theyll find a way.

	Chennai: There is an air of calmness about the Spaniard that is rare among tennis pros. The been-there-done-that look is not pretence. He really has been an extraordinary ambassador for the sport and for his country. 
    
	At an age when most players think of retirement, Carlos Moya, all of 31, finds enough motivation to aim for an Olympic berth and be within the top 15 at the end of 2008. 
    
	Here to participate in the Chennai Open, a tournament he has won twice (2004 and 2005) besides being a finalist in 2006, Moya was at his easygoing best during a promotional on Monday. 
    
	In between sipping from a glass of bubbly, the six-foot-three Moya, selected by People magazine in 1999 as one of its 50 most beautiful people in the world, said he still has the ability to keep going at the highest level. 
    
	Last season was an excellent one for me, the Spaniard said, adding, I rose to 17 in ATP rankings from 43. I maintained my focus well. 
    
	The Mallorcan, a good friend of compatriot and world No. 2 Rafael Nadal, captured at least one ATP title (Sydney) for the eighth consecutive season and finished as the oldest player in top 20. 
    
	On what makes him take on guys 10 years younger than him with the gusto of a teenager, Moya said: I am doing what I really want to do. I love this game and am enjoying myself more than when I was maybe 20 years old. I am capable of playing quite good tennis yet. 
    
	It is no doubt getting tougher and tougher with each passing year, but if I can maintain my fitness, I can be within the top 15 in 2008. 
    
	The former world No. 1, who has 20 career titles including the 1998 French Open to his credit, dispelled notions of immediate retirement but added that hell hang around a couple more years at best. 
    
	I havent seriously thought of retirement but I cant see myself stretching beyond maybe a couple of years. 
    
	On if he harbours the thought of going to the Beijing Olympics, the Spaniard laughed. It will be very tough with so many of us vying for a spot But I would love to get into the team and win it for Spain. 
    
	Moya is a darling of the Chennai crowd and the attraction is clearly mutual. 
    
	I love it here. Chennai is a special place for me I am a two-time champion here I adore the crowd, the atmosphere and Ill be back every time they want me. 
    
	A busy pro in the cut-throat world of tennis, it is his human side that sets Moya apart. 
    
	Named Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year in 2005, Moya donated his earnings of $52,000 after winning the Chennai Open in 2005 to tsunami relief efforts. 
    
	He feels more than physical ability or mental make-up, it is the infrastructure that is coming in the way of India producing the Moyas and Nadals. 
    
	We have so many small tournaments in Spain There are lots of Futures being organised A guy who is taking up tennis gets to play at least 30 Futures events in his formative years. 
    
	Unlike here, the budding talents back home dont need to go abroad to take part in tournaments or in search of good coaches.

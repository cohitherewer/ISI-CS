  - Federation rsquo;s Code of Ethics provides scope for action against Bagan secretary
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra, who made controversial remarks on East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting on Saturday, can be removed from his post under the Code of Ethics of the All India Football Federation (AIFF).         
	According to the Code, adopted by the AIFF executive committee on July 29, 2006, the Mohun Bagan official can invite sanctions for his clearly unethical and discriminatory comments against the rival clubs.         
	The Code of Ethics, which is binding for all officials of AIFF, state associations and clubs, says: These persons shall respect ethical obligations in the performance of their duties as officials of AIFF, its Member Associations or clubs.         
	While discharging their duties, officials shall under no circumstances act in a discriminatory manner, especially in terms of ethnic background, race, cultural values, politics, religion, gender or language. They shall also pledge to behave in a dignified manner.         
	Anyone who does not fulfill or ceases to fulfill these conditions shall be deemed ineligible to serve as an official or a member of a body and, if already in office, shall be relieved of that position.         
	However, the matter can only be taken up by the AIFF if it receives an official complaint from the IFA or the two clubs.         
	AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, when asked about his observation on Mitras reported statement, said he had nothing to say on the issue at the moment.         
	Yes, I have read the newspaper reports but would not like to say anything, was his only reaction.  
	The Code violation  
	 Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra has violated Code 1.1 of the AIFF Code of Ethics and thus is eligible for removal from office under Code 3. The following are the salient features:  
	 While discharging their duties, officials shall under no circumstances act in a discriminatory manner, especially in terms of ethnic background, race, cultural values, politics, religion, gender or language. They shall also pledge to behave in a dignified manner.  
	 Anyone who does not fulfill or ceases to fulfill these conditions shall be deemed ineligible to serve as an official or a member of a body and, if already in office, shall be relieved of that position.

	Monte Carlo: World No. 1 Roger Federer reached the Monte Carlo Masters final when Serbian Novak Djokovic pulled out of their semi-final on Saturday.         
	The Swiss top seed was leading 6-3, 3-2 when Djokovic complained that he felt dizzy and retired.         
	Federer will face Rafael Nadal in Sundays final after the Spaniard beat Russian fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko 6-3, 6-2.         
	I didnt feel good for the last three days. Ive been waking up with a sore throat, said Djokovic. But I thought its not going to be nothing special. But obviously when youre playing against the No. 1 player of the world, you obviously get a lot of balls back and longer points, and I just couldnt get enough energy back after each point.         
	I needed a lot of time. And I just decided not to risk anything. I feel dizziness a little bit in the last three days, he added.         
	I dont know. The doctor in the tournament couldnt give me the right diagnosis.           (REUTERS)

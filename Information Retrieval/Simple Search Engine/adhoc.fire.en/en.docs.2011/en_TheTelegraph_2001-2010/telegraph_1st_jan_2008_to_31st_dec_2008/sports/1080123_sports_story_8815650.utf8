	Adelaide: The influential former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Inderjit Singh Bindra, arrived here on Tuesday. 
    
	According to The Telegraphs sources, he may engage in behind-the-scenes negotiations with the Cricket Australia chairman, Creagh Connor, on the Harbhajan Singh issue. 
    
	Harbhajans appeal against the three-Test ban will be heard here immediately after the Test series, on January 29-30. 
    
	One learns that Harbhajan is going to be defended by the Nagpur-based Venkatesh Manohar, father of the BCCIs president-elect, Shashank Manohar. 
    
	The BCCI too had filed an appeal, but that hasnt been accepted as only individuals can seek redressal. 
    
	While appeals commissioner Justice John Hansen of New Zealand will be in Adelaide, the hearing is going to be conducted via a video-conference, with the counsels for Harbhajan and Andrew Symonds sitting in Mumbai and Melbourne, respectively. 
    
	The modalities should be finalised in a couple of days.

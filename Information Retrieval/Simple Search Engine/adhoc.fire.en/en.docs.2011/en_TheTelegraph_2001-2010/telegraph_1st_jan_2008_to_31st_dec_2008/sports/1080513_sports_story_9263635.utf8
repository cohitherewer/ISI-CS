                                                                                                                                                                                                       IPL a gods gift: Dinda
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ashok Dinda                           
	Calcutta: Ashok Dinda still turns bleary eyed when he remembers his earlier days of struggle  staying away from family, friends in a completely unknown city to nurture his childhood dream of being a fast bowler.         
	All my hard work is paying off. I worked hard during those days and never bothered staying away  I knew that one day my hard work would be recognised I was confident, an emotional Dinda told The Telegraph on Monday afternoon.         
	For the Bengal pacer, all the fame and recognition thats coming his way  courtesy his consistent performance so far in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), has helped him to mature as a cricketer. But he claims to be the same person who set out from his village Naichanpur to achieve his dream.         
	It was really tough for me. It was an unknown city and I knew nobody. Sir (Atal Dev Burman) then allowed me to stay in his house I owe my success to him and everybody who helped me. Without their help I would not have reached here, he said.         
	Dinda, who was the last addition to the Kolkata Knight Riders squad, turned out to be the most dependable bowler for captain Sourav Ganguly. He has bagged eight wickets from eight matches so far with three for 33 runs against the Deccan Chargers in their last IPL tie on Sunday.         
	He, however, believes that despite his brilliant performance, the limelight will still be on teammates Ishant Sharma and Shoaib Akhtar  since according to him they are the stars. He feels he still has a long way to go to achieve that status.         
	Please dont compare me with them They are star players I have still a long way to go There cannot be any comparison. They are my teammates and I will give my best to support them.         
	Asked whether he had chalked out any specific plan for the IPL, Ashok said he stuck to the basics.         
	I havent planned anything I only played a couple of Twenty20 matches before playing here I am not doing anything extraordinary Im just sticking to my natural game. The support of my teammates is my inspiration.         
	I am really enjoying the game. Its real fun. But I feel its a good platform for youngsters like me If we can perform well here we will have opportunities to move ahead I am trying hard, he said.         
	I always try to bowl dot balls Twenty20 is basically a batsmans game. The wickets are flat so that the batsmen can score easily I have always tried to bowl a tight line and length Thats the trick.         
	He also expressed his gratitude for the senior members of the squad  Ricky Ponting, Craig McCullum, David Hussey  including coach john Buchanan.         
	They have helped me a lot. IPL is gods gift for me. I have matured so much within one month... They have motivated me a lot and helped me to think in a different manner while bowling I have learnt so much, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo hold Churchill in 3-3 thriller
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dempo hold Churchill in 3-3 thriller
                      
	Margao: Down by three goals, Dempo fought back superbly through Mboyo Iyomis hattrick, the second of the league, as they held Churchill Brothers to an exciting 3-3 draw in the ONGC I-League, played at Nehru Stadium, on Wednesday.         
	Churchill Brothers, who played aggressively in the first half, scored through Felix Chimaokwu (14th, 20th) and Okolie Odafa (32nd).         
	Dempo fought back in the last quarter of the first half and equalised through Iyomi. The draw takes Dempo to seven points from five matches while Churchill Brothers moved to 12 from six matches.         
	Churchill Brothers, who controlled the match in the first half an hour, capitalised on Dempos defensive lapses to score thrice. Dempo played defender Dominic Noronha in place of the regular John Dias to counter the threat of Odafa. But the ploy failed to work as Mahesh Gawli and Dominic concentrated more in guarding Odafa and allowed space for Felix to operate.         
	The former Salgaocar marksman took advantage and scored a brace in a span of six minutes to put Dempo under pressure. Khan Thang Paite from the left sent a cross which Gawli failed to intercept and Felix sent a firm left footer that found the net in the 14th minute.

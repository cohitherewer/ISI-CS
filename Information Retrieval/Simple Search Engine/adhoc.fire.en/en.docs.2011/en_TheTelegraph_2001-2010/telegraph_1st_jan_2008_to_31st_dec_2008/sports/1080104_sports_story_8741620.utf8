	Sydney: V.V.S. Laxman stroked a fluent century as India fought back spiritedly in the second Test against Australia at the SCG on a day which saw another Steve Bucknor blunder. 
    
	The Australian first innings folded up for 463, built around a career-best unbeaten 162 by Andrew Symonds. The wristy Laxman then took centre stage with a sparkling 109 to steer the visitors to 216 for three at close on the second day. Sachin Tendulkar (9) and Sourav Ganguly (21) were the unbeaten batsmen. 
    
	Indian lost Wasim Jaffer (3) cheaply, but Laxman and Rahul Dravid (53) put the innings back on track with a 175-run partnership on a good track. 
    
	The 33-year-old Hyderabad batsman, who reserves his best against the Australians, unleashed a flurry of breathtaking boundaries to record his third century at the SCG in as many matches, and 12th overall. 
    
	As Laxman fired on all cylinders, Dravid struggled to break the shackles but hung on to frustrate the Aussies. His painstaking 160-ball vigil was brought to an end by Mitchell Johnson. 
    
	Laxman departed soon after, falling to Brad Hogg. But Sachin and Sourav ensured that there was no further damage. 
    
	Resuming at 376 for seven, the Australian tail wagged to put on 87 more runs  Brett Lee hit 59  but not before Symonds got another reprieve from Bucknor. The West Indian refused to refer a stumping appeal, off Harbhajan Singh, to the third umpire. 
    
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni took the bails off, convinced that Symondss foot was not grounded when he let go a delivery down the leg side. Television replays suggested the decision could have gone in favour of the bowler had Bucknor gone to the third umpire. 
    
	Skipper Anil Kumble took all the three wickets on Thursday morning to finish with four for 106. 
    
	India would have been in a still better position had Dravid and Laxman not departed within two runs of each other. 
    
	Laxman arrived at the scene after Jaffer had fallen cheaply to Lee for the third straight time. The openers failed to score in the three overs they faced before lunch. After the break, Lee softened up the right-hander with a couple of short balls before bowling him with a fullish delivery that swung in late. 
    
	India managed 21 runs from their first 10 overs. Laxman then broke loose with a string of fours, most of them off left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson. By tea time, Laxman had gallopped to 73  off 71 balls, with 14 fours. 
    
	At the other end, Dravid was in a runless mode and at one stage was stuck on 18 for 40 deliveries. 
    
	Australia squeezed runs dry in the final session and created opportunities but astonishingly, Adam Gilchrist let those slip by. 
    
	Gilchrist, needing one victim to become only the second wicketkeeper in Test history with 400 scalps, dropped Laxman twice and Dravid once to do the visitors a huge favour. 
    
	Laxman was on 45 and 77 when he got those breaks off Stuart Clark and Lee, respectively. Dravid was let off on 18 off the hard-working Clark. Two other times, edges from Dravid fell just short of fielders in the slips and gully region as the world champions frustration grew by the minute. Dravid was then apparently caught in the slips by Ricky Ponting but the latter was quick to convey that he had not caught it neatly. 
    
	Earlier Dravid was caught in the slips on 15 off a Johnson no ball. 
    
	The Indians rode their luck, with Dravid and Laxman reviving memories of several epic stands they have shared over the years. 
    
	The duo, who were involved in two matchwinning 300-plus stands against Australia in Calcutta (2000-01) and Adelaide (2003-04), played an equally significant role on Thursday. 
    
	Dravid steered a Johnson delivery high to Matthew Hayden at slip and then Laxman pushed at a widish delivery from Hogg to be snapped up by Mike Hussey at short cover.

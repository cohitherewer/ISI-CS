The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All 4 of us looking for gold: Jitender
                                                                                                                                                                                                       All 4 of us looking for gold: Jitender
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Anthresh Lakra                           
	New Delhi: On Saturday, when Jitender Kumar faces Hernandez Lafita of Cuba in the 51 kg semi-final of the AIBA World Championships in Moscow, it could herald a new era in Indian boxing.         
	Never before have Indian pugilists performed so well on the world stage. Apart from Jitender, who missed a medal in Beijing Olympics, three other Indians  Akhil Kumar (54kg), Anthresh Lakra (57kg) and Dinesh Kumar (81kg)  would also be waiting for their turn to make the finals on Saturday.         
	With the Indians already assured of at least four bronze medals, this is definitely the best ever show by Indians in the world meet. Previously, India had won only two medals in the Championships.         
	In 1990 in Mumbai, Zoran Thanga won a bronze and four years later, Devrajan bagged a bronze in the featherweight category.         
	All of us are looking for gold medals, a confident Akhil Kumar told The Telegraph from Moscow. We are in good shape and there is no reason why we should not be able to make it, Akhil, who will be taking on Beijing Olympics silver medallist Leon Alarcon of Cuba, added.         
	But then, there is no reason to believe that it would be cakewalk for the Indians. Dinesh, who defeated Algerias Abdelhafid Benchabla in the previous round, will face 2006 European champion Artur Beterbeiv of Russia, known for his aggressive punches and good technical display.         
	Similarly, Jitenders opponent is a Pan American gold medallist and Lakras rival Idel Torriente of Cuba scored a stunning victory over the bronze winner of the last championships in the first round.         
	Akhil Kumar said all of them were ready to take on any opponent. Our four coaches  G.S. Sandhu, Ramanand, C Kutappa and Jaidev Bisht  have worked really hard to take us to this level. We cannot let them down at this stage of the tournament.         
	All the four boxers agreed that South African physical trainer Heath Mathews played a major role in improving the fitness of the boxers. During the Olympics, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) had initially dropped him from the squad but was brough back after Akhil protested against the decision.         
	For the first time, the World Championship is offering prize money to the winners. While the gold medallists will receive $10,000 each, the silver and the bronze medallists will get $5,000 and $2,500 each, respectively.         
	What has really helped is the decision of the boxing federation to send us to Moscow well before the start of the meet, said Akhil. Otherwise, we would have found it difficult to adjust to the biting cold here.

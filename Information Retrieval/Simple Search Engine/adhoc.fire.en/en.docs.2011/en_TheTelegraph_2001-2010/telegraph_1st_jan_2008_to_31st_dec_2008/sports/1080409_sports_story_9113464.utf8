	London: World womens marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe has said she is more concerned about heat and humidity at the Beijing Olympics than the Chinese capitals pollution despite suffering from asthma.         
	Ethiopian mens world record holder Haile Gebrselassie, who also has asthma, withdrew from the Beijing marathon last month because of concerns about the polluted air.         
	I need the right dosages of my asthma medication but after that I dont think its something you can worry about too much, Radcliffe told the BBC.         
	It might not even be as bad as everyone thinks because Im sure the Chinese will do everything they can to reduce the problem.         
	We are all dealing with the same thing so I dont think worrying about it in advance is that productive.         
	But heat and humidity are a different kettle of fish because theyre things you can prepare for.         
	The 34-year-old Briton pulled out of the 2004 Athens Olympics marathon after 36 km because of a stomach complaint after starting the race as the favourite.         
	She was due to run in Sundays London marathon on the course where she set her world record of 2::15:25 seconds but has withdrawn because of a toe injury.         
	Radcliffe confirmed she wanted to compete at the 2012 London Games and said she believed she could better her world mark.         
	I want to win another world title and I want to run faster, she said. On the right day in the right conditions I believe that is possible.           (REUTERS)

            A STAFF REPORTER            Kolkata Knight Riders Murali Kartik and David Hussey during practice at the Eden on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Murali Kartik has taken the frequent omissions from the national side in his stride and is working hard for a new beginning.         
	Ive been unfortunate. There have been several ups and downs in my international career. I dont know why? he said on Monday.         
	Just when I was set for a comeback versus South Africa last month I twisted my ankle. I was very confident of going to Australia but that too didnt happen, the left-arm spinner said.         
	I dont know if the selectors want me to sit on the fence, he said of getting frequent raw deals from the selectors.         
	Kartik, who made his international debut in 2000, said he was still hoping to make a comeback as the third spinner.         
	Fortunately or unfortunately India have had two great spinners in Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. If two spinners are playing in a Test, its got to be Anil and Harbhajan But if somebody else is preferred as the third spinner then theres reason to feel deprived. I have made 14/15 comebacks during my career and I can take anything on my chin.         
	Playing for Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League, Kartik is confident of doing well.         
	Everybody has been enjoying it since its a unique concept. Its been an exciting beginning Looking at the way teams are preparing, its looks like an international meet.         
	People think Twenty20 is slambang cricket and it is so. But spinners have a definite role, and is crucial from overs seven to 16. They can slow down the game and the rate of scoring. They can perform much better than pacers. In a key game the right delivery at the right time can change equations, he said.         
	David Hussey too agreed with Kartik about the new experience. Its been fantastic. All the players have been gelling well Everybody wants to win and there will be competition. Were aiming to win the championship.         
	The Australian also said he was excited to play under Sourav Gangulys leadership. I am looking forward to playing under Sourav. Hes a superb player and knows his game inside out. I am excited about it He is a great player and a great captain. I will also be learning a few things from him.

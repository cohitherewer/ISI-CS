                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gambhir century seals easy victory over Bangladesh
                  Virender Sehwag on way to his 59 in Dhaka on Thursday                     
	Dhaka: Powered by an unbeaten century by Gautam Gambhir, India on Thursday defeated Bangladesh comprehensively by seven-wickets in the last league match of the tri-series to set up a summit clash against arch-rivals Pakistan on Saturday.         
	Set 223 to win, India overhauled the modest target with 14.5 overs to spare as Indian openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir scorched the Sher-e-Bangla stadium with thundering shots all around.         
	Sehwag (58), who hit a blazing half-century, put up 85 runs in just 10 overs for the first wicket along with Gambhir, setting a firm foundation for the convincing victory.         
	It was Gambhirs second successive hundred against Bangladesh and fifth overall, studded with 13 boundaries and one shot over the fence.         
	India emerged as superior side in the tournament, finishing the league match engagements with two victories in as many matches and qualified for the final in style.         
	And Pakistan by virtue of their win against Bangladesh managed a berth in the final.         
	Earlier, Raqibul Hasan hit a brilliant 89-run knock to steer Bangladesh to 222 all out in 49.5 overs, after electing to bat on a good bating track.         
	Hasan rescued Bangladesh when the hosts lost their openers by furious Indian pacers inside first six overs. He then joined hands with his skipper Mohammed Ashraful to pull his team out of pits and weaved a 76-run stand for the third wicket and took the score to 93 for three.         
	For India, R.P. Singh, who came in for Ishant Sharma was pick of the bowlers with impressive figures of 3 for 46. Praveen Kumar, struck in the very first over with Tamim Iqbal edging to Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	In reply, after Ferhad Reza and Mashrafe Mortaza failed to stop the merciless Delhi duo, skipper Mohammed Ashraful introduce young Dolar Mahmud into the attack in the 10th over.         
	However, Ashraful had no idea what was in store for Mahmud as the Najafgarh marauder creamed him for 22 runs, hitting him for two extra-cover sixes and two leg-side boundaries.         
	In the process, Sehwag completed his 27th one-day half century in just 27 balls, though he succumbed on the last ball of the over while trying to hook Mahmud for another big shot.         
	Gambhir, who did not get much strike earlier, had reeled off three boundaries in a Reza over, before Sehwag unleashed a flurry of strokes. Mumbai batsman Rohit Sharma joined Gambhir as skipper Dhoni opted to continue with the left-right combination.         
	The run-rate did suffer in absence of Sehwag as Bangladesh slow bowlers  Mahmudullah and Abdur Razzak  put the breaks on the free flowing runs for some time.         
	The overs between 10 to 20 fetched India just 48 runs and to break the shackles Sharma (26) went for an extravagant shot of Razzak, mistimed that, and ended up in the hands of Mortaza. Gambhir paced his innings well and along with Yuvraj Singh (26) took India closer to the target.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand out of title race with another defeat
                                                   Anand out of title race with another defeat
                      
	Nice: World champion Viswanathan Anands third successive loss has put him out of the title race in the Amber Blindfold and Rapid chess tournament as he went down 0.5-1.5 against Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine in the ninth round here.         
	Anands form in the rapid was found wanting once again as the Indian blundered a pawn for little compensation after earlier drawing the blindfold game.         
	The loss put Anand decisively out of reckoning for the top honours after Armenian Levon Aronian scored a resounding 2-0 victory over Alexander Morozevich of Russia.         
	Aided by the fine triumph, Aronian took his tally to 12.5 points in the overall standings and stretched his lead to a whopping 2.5 points over nearest rivals Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, Peter Leko of Hungary and Magnus Carlsen of Ukraine.         
	Ivanchuk and Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria share the fifth spot jointly on 9.5 points each while Anand slipped to seventh spot on 9 points.         
	With just two rounds remaining, Aronian appears to be a confirmed bet for the overall title as well as rapid where he has two points lead over Ivanchuk, Carlsen and Leko. Anand stands joint fifth in rapid on 4.5 points.         
	There is fiercer contest in the blindfold where it is now a three-way lead between Kramnik, Morozevich and Aronian who have 5.5 points each.         
	Topalov, Leko and Carlsen are next in line on five points while Anand shares the seventh spot in this section on 4.5 points.         
	Earlier, playing white, Anand was surprised by Ivanchuk in the opening when the latter opted for the Pirc defense and when the indian realised there was not much for him as white, the peace was a natural result.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Richard Hadlee                           
	New Delhi: Sir Richard Hadlee became a Sachin Tendulkar fan from the time he watched him play some 18 years ago.         
	I remember Sachin came to New Zealand in 1990. He was only 16 or 17 at that time. He scored 80 very good runs. There was a real touch of class in him, recalled Hadlee, the first player to capture 400 wickets in Test cricket.         
	Hadlee is not surprised that Tendulkar is batting so well even today. He has been absolute magic since the time he started playing, said Hadlee, who is in the capital as a brand ambassador for the Airtel Half Marathon to be held on Sunday.         
	Hadlee doesnt agree with the people who think the time has come for the Little Master to call it a day. He is still batting very well. Only yesterday he scored his 40th Test century. He is a role model in cricket. I think he knows well when to call it a day, said Hadlee, who retired from international cricket at the age of 39.

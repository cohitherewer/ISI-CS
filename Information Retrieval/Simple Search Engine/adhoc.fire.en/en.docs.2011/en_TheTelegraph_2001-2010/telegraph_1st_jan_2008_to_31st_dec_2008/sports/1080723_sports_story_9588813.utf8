	ANECDOTES         
	Feat         
	The highlight of the Games was Bob Beamons astonishing 8.90m leap to take the long jump gold, beating the previous mark by 55cm. His record would stand until fellow American Mike Powell leapt 8.95m at the 1991 world championships in Tokyo.         
	Prison         
	Ethiopian Mamo Wolde, who won the marathon, was arrested in 1992 and thrown in prison for his part in the Red Terror tribunal, a former dictatorial regime.               
	EXPLOIT         
	High altitude, high octane. In the rarified air of a city perched over 2,000 metres above sea level, the Mexico Games of 1968 produced a feat that literally took the sports worlds breath away.         
	Bob Beamon was its architect, leaping into Olympic folklore with a monumental 8.90metre world record jump that was so long that the measuring machine, which was no longer in use, had to be brought out of retirement one last and historic time.         
	It was hailed as one of the greatest athletic achievements of all time.         
	SUMMARY         
	The incredible leap of 8m 90cm made by American Bob Beamon to win an astonishing long-jump contest was typical of several advances on and off the sports field made at the 1968 Games in Mexico City.         
	At an altitude of 2200m, American sprinters broke record after record, Jim Hines clocking 9.95 sec in the 100m, Tommy Smith with 19.83sec in the 200m and Lee Evans with 43.86 sec in the 400m all establishing surprisingly advanced world records.         
	In the high-jump amazed spectators saw Dick Fosbury jump backwards over the bar as all his rivals chose the conventional method of jumping on their stomaches.         
	The Fosbury Flop became the new style to tackle the bar. The Olympic stadium was not the only one to see spectacular action.         
	In gymnastics, Czechoslovakias Vera Caslavska added to her three gold medals won four years previous in Tokyo by hauling in another four titles and two silver medals while in swimming Australias Mike Wenden pulled off a famous double with the 100m and 200m freestyle golds.         
	But the 34 world records broken in Mexico City were overshadowed by political events.         
	Mexican authorities had shot dead 300 demonstrating students in a never to be forgiven bloodbath just prior to the Games.         
	Soviet tanks had rolled out into Prague that summer and the Vietnam war was in full swing.         
	American athlete Tommie Smith wins the 200 m event final ahead of Australian Norman (not on pic) and compatriot John Carlos (L) during the Mexico Olympic Games 17 October 1968 in Mexico City.         
	And Vietnam was not the only source of shame for the US. On the 200m podium two American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos gave the Black Panther salute to protest civil rights abuse in the USA that still practised racial segregation.         
	Their gesture of raising black-gloved fists to the skies earned a ban by their own delegation and they returned to a hostile reception on arrival in America.

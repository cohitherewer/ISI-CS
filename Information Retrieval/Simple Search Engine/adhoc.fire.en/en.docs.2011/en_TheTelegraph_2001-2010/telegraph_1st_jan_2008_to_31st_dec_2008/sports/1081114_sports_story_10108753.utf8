The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Teams play down spat

	Rajkot: Relations became strained at Trent Bridge 15 months ago when Ian Bell tried to distract Indias batsmen by placing jelly beans on the pitch during a Test match.         
	If that was a puerile prank that backfired (India went on to win the series 2-1), there was no sugar coating to Thursdays set-to, which saw tempers rise after cricket balls were struck into each others net areas.         
	England, came under the greatest bombardment and were the first to react when Andrew Flintoff marched over to upbraid Indias bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad. Flintoff had been waiting to bat when another mighty slog from Indias nets scattered those waiting to bowl.         
	It probably wasnt deliberate on Indias part, but some fairly robust language was obviously used by Flintoff.         
	Later, Flintoff refused to comment on the matter, though Prasad, perhaps sensing a row brewing, said they were just having friendly chat as they hadnt seen each other for a while.         
	Cricket balls can cause serious damage, and just in case Flintoffs message was ignored, Peter Moores also went over to speak with his opposite number Gary Kirsten. Afterwards, both coaches as well as both captains, were keen to play down the incident.         
	Garys a sound guy and I just went over and had a word about it, Moores said, after practice had finished.         
	Its unusual for two teams to practise at the same time. Also, the nets are quite low so its easy for the ball to go out of them when someone is practising the slog-sweep. Nobody was hurt but the last thing you want is for someone to get hit.         
	Pietersen, who belted one of his famous switch-hits straight into Indias net, said he wasnt aware of the exchanges going on as he was batting at the time. But we mustnt read too much into it, he said.         
	Indias captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, one of those who powered a few in Englands direction, was equally blas. Dhoni said: There are big hitters on both sides, and balls were flying around everywhere.

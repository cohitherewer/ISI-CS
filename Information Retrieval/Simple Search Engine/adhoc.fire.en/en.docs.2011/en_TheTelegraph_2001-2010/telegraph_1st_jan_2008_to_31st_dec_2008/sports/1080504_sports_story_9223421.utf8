                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mithali stars in victory 
                      
	Colombo: Skipper Mithali Raj played a captains knock by smashing a superb 54 to steer India to a 29-run win over Sri Lanka in the womens Asia Cup in Dambulla on Saturday.         
	Mithalis 63-ball knock, aided by nine boundaries and a valuable contribution by Priyanka Roy (44) helped India post 227 for eight in 50 overs after electing to bat.         
	In reply, Sri Lanka, who looked in good touch as they reached 132 for three in 37 overs, could not finish the job and were bowled out for 198 in 49.5 overs. Opener Dedunu Silva scored a brilliant 87-ball 74 but in vain.         
	Earlier, Mithali played an anchors role, stitching the Indian innings after her team was reduced to 98 for three.

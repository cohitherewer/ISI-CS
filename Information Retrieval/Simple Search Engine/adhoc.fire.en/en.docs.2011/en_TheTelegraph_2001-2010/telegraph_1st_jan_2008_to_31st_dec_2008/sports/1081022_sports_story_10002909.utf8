The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians fall short of more than just runs
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Australians fall short of more than just runs
  - Its a mind-set thing, not so much a worry about our skills, says Ricky Ponting       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ricky Ponting                                 
	Chandigarh: For a team credited with taking cricket to the next level, or at least trying to, the Australians strategy in the ongoing Test series has been incredibly short on purpose and aggression.         
	The one-time masters at the mental disintegration of the opposition have themselves gone to pieces. How else can one explain the bizarre strategy, particularly on the fourth day (Monday), in neighbouring Mohali?         
	Unbelievably, spearhead Brett Lee wasnt asked to bowl in the first session! Then, Matthew Hayden, who is approaching his 100th Test, batted as if he had a flight to catch, for Brisbane, before the day ended.         
	Coach Tim Nielsens failure to explain the Lee-treatment, at a media conference, confirmed the Ricky Pontings have (for now, certainly) gone the way of most teams which toured Australia in the past decade.         
	All credit, of course, to Team India.         
	Frankly, the Australians lack of aggression has shocked me... The aggression has all been from our boys, a former India captain and cricket manager, Ravi Shastri, told The Telegraph.         
	Not that anybody is complaining, though.         
	The Australians may have had a slight upperhand in the drawn first Test (Bangalore), but couldnt get even a toehold in Mohali.         
	Ponting admitted as much. Yes, its pretty much as simple as that  we were outplayed... Its a mind-set thing, not so much a worry about our skills... If we want it enough, we can do it...         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has now led India to wins in both Tests as stand-in captain, was spot on when he said: Mohali was one Test match where nothing went wrong. It was the perfect game for us.         
	In fact, the 320-run rout is the best for India in terms of runs.         
	While the Australians will need to dig deep for positives (if any) at the series half-way stage, the dilemma over Anil Kumble notwithstanding, the pluses for Team India have been many.         
	To speak specifically of Mohali, from the oldest member of the XI, Sourav Ganguly, to debutant Amit Mishra, just about everybody performed big. Marvellous team effort, if ever there was one.         
	This is Souravs farewell series and while fans would like him to review his decision, the former captain, who posted a controlled and very crucial 102 in the first innings, is firm about bowing out in Na-gpur, venue of the fourth and last Test.         
	Mohali was perfect for Dhoni too, who got adjudged the MoM. Additionally, the list of those bowled over by his rather refreshing brand of captaincy has, of course, swelled.         
	Actually, Australias much-talked about bench strength, often regarded as a model for other nations, has been exposed. On this tour, more than ever before, theyve missed Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath. Adam Gilchrist as well.         
	Getting Greg Chappell on board as assistant coach, till the second Test, was widely seen as a masterstroke. But he has to be judged by results and the head coach at the Centre of Excellence wont be going home with a tour-related feather in his cap.         
	If anything, the Chappell experience has shown that the presence of X or Y on a chair in the support staff-corner may not make any difference at all         
	At the end of the day, the players face destiny on their own.         
	Footnote: Its hardly a well-earned break, but the Australians will have three days to do what they please before the first training session ahead of the next Test, in New Delhi. Theyre free to travel where they like, but most are likely to stay in the capital itself.

	New Delhi: After Ranjan Sodhi, it was the turn of ace shooter Gagan Narang to strike a gold in an international meet on the eve of Olympics.         
	While Sodhi bagged the top spot in double trap shooting at Belgrade two weeks ago, Narang, considered one of Indias best hopes for Beijing, surpassed the air rifle mens world record at an Olympic test event at Hanover in Germany.         
	Narangs score of 704.3 was 1.2 more than the existing world record of 703.1 set by Austrian shooter Thomas Farnik at Grenada in 2006.         
	Narang is enjoying a tremendous form in 2008. His qualification scores never dipped below 595 out of 600 and he became the first Indian ever to figure in a 50-metre three-position rifle final.

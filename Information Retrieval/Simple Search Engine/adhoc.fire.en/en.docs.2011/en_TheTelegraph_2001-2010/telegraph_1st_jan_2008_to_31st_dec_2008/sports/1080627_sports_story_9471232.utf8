The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Awesome India much too good for Pakistan
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Awesome India much too good for Pakistan
  - Raina MoM for second day in succession, helps carry forward points       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Suresh Raina (left) and Virender Sehwag in action in Karachi on Thursday. (AFP, AP)                                 
	Karachi: Where performances go, Team Indias was absolutely awesome under the National Stadium floodlights on Thursday.         
	And, no, Board president Sharad Pawar didnt have to fire off an email (after the defeat in Dhaka). And, yes, the dropped catches (including two in one Yusuf Pathan over) can be forgiven.         
	With Virender Sehwag and young Suresh Raina (MoM for the second time in 24 hours) stitching together a massive 198-run partnership for the second-wicket, the target  300  was reached with plenty to spare.         
	Pakistans cause wasnt helped by spearhead Umar Gul going off with a side strain in only his second over. The hosts also paid for managing no more than 26 in the first 10 overs.         
	That used to be the strategy most teams adopted against the West Indies for about a decade from the latter part of the Seventies. Times, though, have changed and the acceleration cant be put on hold almost indefinitely.         
	Sehwag posted 119, while Raina got 84. Both scored at a fast clip. Their assault was furious and merciless, with Pakistan reduced to the level of Hong Kong.         
	The six-wicket win took India to the top of Pool B in the Asia Cup and the Mahendra Singh Dhonis take to the Super Fours with the comfort of two carried-over points.         
	Pakistan now have a daunting task: To make the July 6 final here, theyve got to win all three Super Four matches.         
	Because of the points which will be carried over, its a double win for us We won twice over, remarked a visibly pleased Dhoni.         
	Reflecting on the match, the Team India captain said: It was a placid wicket, with nothing for the spinners With Gul going off, Pakistan did have a problem A target of 350 couldve been tough         
	Dhoni praised Sehwag (always a pleasure watching him bat Hes just got to play his natural game) and Raina (its good that hes building on the starts), but didnt really nail the profligate Ishant Sharma who went for 69 in his quota of overs.         
	The captain, by the way, had a word of praise for the largely sporting and handsome turnout at the National Stadium. When theres support overseas, its like India It will be interesting to see the support we get in the next stage.         
	Counterpart Shoaib Malik, whose 125 (retired hurt) turned out to be of no use, put up a brave face. The effort to win all three (Super Four) matches will be there         
	Incidentally, without getting into specifics, Malik indicated he was most unhappy at not having the final say in the selection of the playing XI. At home, the selectors call the shots.         
	To talk of the MoM         
	Around this time last year, Raina didnt quite know what the immediate future held for him. Hed undergone knee surgery and the rehab wouldnt end all that quickly.         
	Raina did return among the Men in Blue earlier this year, but its in this Asia Cup that hes been making the sort of impact Greg Chappell was sure he would, sooner rather than later.         
	Seen as a Chappell protege, Rainas debut had been in the Australians first assignment as the Team India coach, in Sri Lanka, almost three years ago.         
	The Chappell-connection didnt endear Raina to everybody. Thats something which the then coach himself sensed before the end of his tenure.         
	Indeed, in a one-on-one with The Telegraph before the 2007 World Cup, Chappell went to the extent of saying: The one who has come under the most criticism is Raina Well, if you look at his (ODI) record and compare it with Sachin Tendulkars at the same stage of his career, you wont find a difference         
	Chappells bound to be pleased today.         
	Senior pro Sehwag made the bigger contribution, but Raina made capital of being promoted to No.3 after Gautam Gambhirs rather early dismissal (something rare nowadays).         
	After a forced break, Rainas journey at the level which counts has only just resumed. Its a long haul, but hes begun exceedingly well.   
	INDIA rsquo;S SUPER FOUR MATCHES  
	Versus Bangladesh on June 28    
	 Versus Pakistan on July 2    
	 Versus Sri Lanka on July 3

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blatters warning   to Spain 
                                                   Blatters warning   to Spain 
                            
	Madrid: Spain will be barred from competing in international competitions if their government continues to pressure the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) to hold an early election, Fifa president Sepp Blatter has said.         
	If the Spanish government, through their Sports Council (CSD), continue to interfere in footballing affairs they will have to recognise that their clubs and national team will be excluded from international tournaments, Blatter was quoted as saying in Spanish media on Monday.         
	It would be tough, but it would only take six hours to call a Fifa emergency committee meeting to hear and decide upon Spains exclusion.         
	Spain would not be able to play at Euro 2008, and their clubs wouldnt continue in the Champions League or Uefa Cup.         
	Blatters backing for RFEF president Angel Maria Villar comes after the CSD called for all sporting federations not involved in the Olympic Games to hold elections before Beijing 2008.         
	It (government intervention in football affairs) is not a new problem for Fifa, he added. It first occurred in Portugal where a letter from us was sufficient to change the law governing sport.

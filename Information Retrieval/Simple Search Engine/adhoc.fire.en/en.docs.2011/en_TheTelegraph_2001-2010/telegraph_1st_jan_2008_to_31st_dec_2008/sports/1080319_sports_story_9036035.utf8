	New Delhi: Indian Hockey Federations (IHF) plan to persist with Joaquim Carvalho received a setback when a host of former Olympians categorically asked IHF president K.P.S. Gill to let Ric Charlesworth guide the senior national team.         
	Gill, on Tuesday, called a number of ex-Olympians and chief coach Carvalho at his residence to discuss the future plan of action.         
	Though no IHF official was ready to come on record, sources said that the Olympians made it clear that it would be wrong to keep the Australian coach disconnected from the senior national team.         
	On Monday, the IHF and the sports ministry had asked Charlesworth to look after the mens under-19 and under-21 squads and the senior womens squad.         
	Following a three-hour meeting with the Olympians, that included former captains Balbir Singh, Ajit Pal Singh, MP Ganesh, Zafar Iqbal, BP Govinda and Harmik Singh, Gill asked Charlesworth to join the meeting in the evening.         
	The Australian, who on Monday had said that he would take the next flight home if denied a role with the seniors, looked happier.         
	He, however, remained tightlipped and refused to be involved in a discussion about his meeting with Gill and IHF secretary Jyothikumaran.         
	We have made some progress, Charlesworth said. We have moved forward a little. We will talk again in the next few days.         
	A former Olympian, who didnt wish to be named, said: We have told the IHF to form a sub-committee comprising former players, coaches and Charlesworth to monitor and implement the programmes to revive Indian hockey.         
	We have made it clear that Charlesworth should be involved in the functioning of the senior team and things should not left in the hands of Carvalho only, the Olympian said.         
	He should also be allowed to be involved in the selection process. That would make him more accountable.         
	Carvalho, who also had a meeting with IHF officials and submitted his report on Santiago, said he had informed the officials about the reasons for the defeat.

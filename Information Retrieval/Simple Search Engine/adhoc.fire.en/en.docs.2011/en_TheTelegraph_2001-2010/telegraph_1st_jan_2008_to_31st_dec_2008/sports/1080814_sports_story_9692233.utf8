The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahela: We need to keep working hard
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mahela: We need to keep working hard
                      
	Colombo: Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene on Wednesday said his team have gained in confidence after winning the Tests series and would make sure that they did the right things in the ODIs against India as well.         
	We are very confident about the way we are playing. We are developing a young group of players to take over and senior guys are doing a great job. We just need to be working hard. Just make sure that we do all the things right, Jayawardene told reporters here.         
	Jayawardene said his team would start practising from Thursday for the five-match ODI series beginning August 18 and the focus would be on right execution of the plan.         
	It is always a different game. We had a different game plan (for the Test series) and we executed it. We handled pressure a bit better and we did well, very proud of that.         
	The one-day game is totally different. And the Indians have a different team altogether. They only have three or four guys (from the Test squad) who remain.         
	We just have to make sure that we get our game plan right again and focus on what we need to do. We had a couple of days off and we will start training tomorrow. We will start preparing as we prepare for any tournament and get our focus back, he added.         
	Jayawardene had not given much thought to the role of Ajantha Mendis against India because winning was important not an individual of a team.           (PTI)

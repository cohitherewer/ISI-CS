The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ranty brings Dempo back on track
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ranty brings Dempo back on track
                      
	New Delhi: A brace from Nigerian Ranty Martins brought I-League champions Dempo Sports Club back on track in the AFC Cup as the Goan outfit upset Bahrain league winners Muharraq 2-1 in an away match, as reported in Thursdays Late City edition.         
	Martins found the net in the 11th and 62nd minutes and held on after Brazilian striker Leandson da Silva converted a 77th minute penalty to pull one back for Muharraq at the National Stadium in Manama on Wednesday night.         
	Their second win in the competition took Dempos tally to six points and they are one behind group A leaders Muharraq and Lebanese champions Al Ansar, who beat Sur of Oman 2-0 in the other pool match. There are two group matches left for all the teams.         
	Dempo went ahead when Brazilian playmaker Robert Silvas free-kick was flicked on by Chidi Edeh for his compatriot Martins to find the net.         
	The hosts could have drawn level four minutes later but Leandson volleyed over the crossbar before Abdulla Omar also shot over midway through the first half.         
	Goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal came to Dempos rescue on more than one occasion  most notably when he diverted Abdullas close range shot away from danger in first-half stoppage time. Luck was also on Dempos side as Jaycee Johns well-struck effort rattled off the crossbar in the second half and the ball was scrambled clear by John Dias.         
	The lead was doubled soon as Martinss first time volley from Silvas free-kick found the back of the net.         
	Continuous Muharraq pressure eventually bore fruit 13 minutes from time when Domnic Noronha fouled substitute striker Mohamed Jaafar inside the penalty area and Leandson made no mistake.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania seeded 32nd at Wimbledon
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sania seeded 32nd at Wimbledon
                                  
	London: Sania Mirza has been seeded 32nd for the Wimbledon Championship starting here next week.         
	Sania, who returned to the court only a week ago after missing the entire clay court season due to a wrist injury which required surgery, did not experience any major dip in her WTA rankings during the layoff and is 33rd in the latest chart, which is the sole criteria used for deciding the seedings.         
	Sanias best performance at the All-England club was her third-round appearance last year. She won the junior Wimbledon doubles title before turning pro in 2005.         
	French Open champion Ana Ivanovic of Serbia has been given the top billing, followed by compatriot Jelena Jankovic. Russian glamour-girl Maria Sharapova has been seeded third with compatriots Svetlana Kuznetsova and Elena Dementieva at fourth and fifth, respectively.         
	Among men, Marcos Baghdatis and Tomas Berdych have both benefitted from Wimbledons unique seedings policy this year after strong showings in 2007.         
	The seedings have Cypriot Baghdatis seeded 10th compared to a world ranking of 25. Czech Berdych is seeded 11th despite an ATP ranking of 19.         
	Baghdatis reached the quarter finals at Wimbledon last year where he lost to Novak Djokovic in a five-set marathon. Berdych also reached the last eight, losing to Rafael Nadal.                     
	Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam which does not stick strictly to the ATP ranking list in deciding seedings. In allocating the 32 slots, the seedings committee takes into account performances on grass over a two-year period.         
	Five-time champion Roger Federer, who extended his winning run on grass to 59 matches when he defended his Halle title, is seeded one.         
	Lleyton Hewitt, the 2002 champion, is seeded 20, seven higher than his world ranking, but there is no seeding for Croatias Mario Ancic, a former semi-finalist and the last man to beat Federer at Wimbledon.

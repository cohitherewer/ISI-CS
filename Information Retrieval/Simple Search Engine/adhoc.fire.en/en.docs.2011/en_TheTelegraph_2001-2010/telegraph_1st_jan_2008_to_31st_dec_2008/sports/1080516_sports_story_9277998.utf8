The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Henin happiest away from court
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Henin happiest away from court
    - Last year was the best French Open... with my family in stands                                             Justine Henin during the news conference on Wednesday            
	Washington: The happiest one has ever seen Justine Henin was away from a tennis court. There wasnt a racket in her hand. Not a silver Grand Slam trophy. Not a million-dollar-plus winners check. Instead, heres why Henin was giddy: She was rocking her six-week-old niece in her arms.         
	It was about an hour after the lithe Belgian with the bigger-than-youd-think strokes won the 2007 French Open. Henin was standing in a players lounge, surrounded by her formerly estranged father and siblings, revelling more in her recently reconstructed family life than in the sixth of her seven major championships.         
	Not quite a full year later, Henin again was surrounded by her relatives, again content as could be, only on Wednesday, she said she is no longer driven to be the best in her sport. She wont be defending her title at Roland Garros when the clay court Grand Slam begins May 25, and she wont be defending her US Open title in the fall, either.         
	All of 25, she suddenly, stunningly, walked away from tennis, the first woman to retire while ranked No. 1 by the WTA.         
	I realised that I was at the end of the road, Henin said during a news conference at her tennis academy outside Brussels. I lived through it all, I had given it all.         
	Henin always got by on her grit as much as her groundstrokes, and she made it quite clear on Wednesday that her heart isnt in it the way it was for so long. Thats what is so surprising about the news  and its timing.         
	She won the French Open each of the past three years, and four times overall. And that tournament was, after all, the first she attended in person as a fan, sitting in the stands as a 10-year-old with her mother. Two years later, her mother died of cancer.         
	Sure, Henin has been struggling to meet her lofty standards lately, failing to go beyond the quarter finals at her past three events. And she was walloped by Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams this season, dropping a 0-6 set against each.         
	Still, all athletes in all sports have their ups and downs. Henin herself went through several trying periods, including when she was off the Tour for months at a time while dealing with health problems, and later when she was splitting from her husband, Pierre-Yves Hardenne.         
	Henin once spoke the phrase, Impossible is nothing, and one of her sponsors turned that into the centre of a massive marketing campaign. It captured her on-court philosophy, and was exemplified countless times, including when she beat Jennifer Capriati in the 2003 US Open semi-finals despite being two points from defeat 10 times and trailing 3-5 in the second set and 2-5 in the third. Henin needed IV fluids after that match, which ended after midnight, but the next day won the final.         
	And what of the possibility of returning? Shed hardly be the first athlete to come out of retirement. Henin rebuffed that Wednesday.         
	When I decide something, I do it the right way, she said.         
	Seconds later, she added: Last year was the best French Open that I could dream of for the last one  with my family back, with my family in the stands. That was awesome. That was a great feeling. And Im going to keep this feeling forever now. (AP)

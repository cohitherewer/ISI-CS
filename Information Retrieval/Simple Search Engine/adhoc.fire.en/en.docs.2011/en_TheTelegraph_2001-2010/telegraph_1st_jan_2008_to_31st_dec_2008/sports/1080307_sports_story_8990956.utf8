                                                   Bhajji: We wanted to show them our guts
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Harbhajan Singh said son Thursday that the Australian players, media and the public combined to launch a tirade against him during the tour Down Under.         
	There was a time when almost everyone was busy finding faults with me, he said. It looked as if it was Harbhajan versus Australia. It did affect me but I had to get on with the game.         
	The off-spinner was happy that the Indians could match the Australians tough attitude. In a way it was a very special tour. We all wanted to do well. You simply feel proud of yourself when you do well in Australia. After all, they play really tough cricket. This was the best time to show them our skill and guts. In the end, it was an extremely satisfying experience.         
	Harbhajan made it clear that the hosts were to be blamed for the poor on-field relationship between the teams.         
	We didnt start it, for sure. The drama began at the Sydney Cricket Ground when Sachin (Tendulkar) and myself were batting. They dealt personal insults at me. I didnt like it and gave it back to them.         
	Despite the furore, Harbhajan has no ill feeling towards Matthew Hayden or Andrew Symonds. Both of them are tremendous players and can take the game away from you, Harbhajan admitted. It was particularly satisfying that I could get rid of them in the first final.         
	Not everyone in Australia behaved in the manner Symonds or Hayden did.         
	There were people who came up to congratulate us after our win. (Brett) Lee and (Adam) Gilchrist came to our dressing room after we won in Perth.         
	Before the second final in Brisbane, Harbhajan said Sachin had written on dressing room blackboard: Dont rush, take your own time. The off-spinner had added a line: Whatever we make, we will win.         
	We had to finish it off in Brisbane, the offie stressed. Ponting wanted to play in only two finals. We obliged him.         
	The focus is obviously on the youngsters but Sachin, the senior most pro, didnt forget to make a point of his own.         
	At this moment we should not forget those who have been contributing to the teams success but were not there in the tri-series.         
	Sachins comments should gladden the Sourav Gangulys and Rahul Dravids.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was happy with the huge crowd that thronged the Kotla. I am thrilled to see so many people here. This is the kind of motivation that the team needs. We cannot do anything without the fans support.         
	We will continue to entertain you and win matches, Dhoni said amid raucous cheers.         
	Later, talking to a television channel, Dhoni said there is nothing wrong in being transparent.         
	I am a transparent person. Whatever happens on the field... I just repeat it at the press conference. There is nothing confidential about it, Dhoni said when asked about his comments against teammates when they have a bad day on the field.

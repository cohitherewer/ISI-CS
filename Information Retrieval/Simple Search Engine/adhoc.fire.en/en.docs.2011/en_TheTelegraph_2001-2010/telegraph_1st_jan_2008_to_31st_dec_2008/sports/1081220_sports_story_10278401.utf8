The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Happy to be with Bengal: Ranadeb
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Happy to be with Bengal: Ranadeb
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The strapping Ranadeb Bose is still an angry man but has learnt to channelise his emotions into his bowling as the Goa batsmen found out at the Ranji Trophy Plate Division semi-final at the Karnail Singh Stadium here on Friday. Happy just to be bowling, he focussed on landing the ball in the right areas as he picked up five wickets in an eight-over burst with the new ball.                           
	On getting a five-for against Goa         
	I am not happy as a professional. I have performed against better teams. To be honest, I was just trying to swing the ball. I have bowled a lot of overs on such slow pitches.         
	On the pressure that the bowling unit carried to the field         
	We were actually carrying a lot of pressure. Bengal has depended more on the bowling attack than the batsmen to deliver the goods. Barring Manoj (Tiwary) and to an extent Wriddi (Wriddhiman Saha), none of our batsmen have got big runs. In fact, we had planned that we would bowl first if we won the toss. It was a bit difficult, though 337 is a good score but something that can be chased down.         
	On the importance of his 42-run last-wicket stand with Sourav Sarkar         
	It was very important. I keep doing this. I might not score runs but I try to stick around. Sourav (Sarkar) was playing brilliantly, cover drives and cuts. He told me that he was batting well and if I could stay at the crease for him, the team could get a few runs. We were looking at going past 350.         
	Whether he is still an angry young man         
	I am angry... but I have learnt to channelise my anger into my bowling. During IPL I was not getting to play at all. My thoughts are old-school. I do not believe in excessive cricket. I am a cricketer, a professional and I want to play every day. I am happy to be bowling and bowling in the right areas. In fact, nothing excites me more than bowling.         
	On his new-ball partnership with Ashok Dinda         
	I have been fortunate that I have had new ball partners like Shib Shankar Paul and Ashok Dinda. All of us can bowl long spells. It is not as if we take rest after five over spells. It was brilliant with Shib Shankar and it is very early days with Dinda. I am sure we will be a force to reckon with if we play a year or so together.         
	Whether he contemplated moving from Bengal         
	I had offers but I realised that it was my responsibility to help Bengal because I was a part of the side that had been relegated from Elite Division. Even my father said If you want to leave Bengal, leave next year. Make sure that Bengal get to play in the Elite Division before you think of leaving. At the end of the day, I am very happy playing for Bengal.

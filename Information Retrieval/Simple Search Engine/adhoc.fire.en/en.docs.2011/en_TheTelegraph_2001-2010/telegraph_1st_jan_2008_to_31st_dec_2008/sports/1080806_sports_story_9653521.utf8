  - GOING BACK IN TIME: SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING OLYMPIANS                               
	LARISA LATYNINA         
	Name  Larisa Latynina         
	Country  USSR         
	Date of birth  1934-12-27         
	Birthplace  Kherson         
	Discipline  gymnastics         
	Olympic Games (18 medals: 9 gold, 5 silver, 4 bronze)         
	The daughter of a docker who worked on the Black Sea, Larissa Latynina transcended her destiny to win nine Olympic gold medals, a feat only achieved by other Olympic legends Mark Spitz, Paavo Nurmi and Carl Lewis.         
	The Soviet gymnast who revolutionised the floor event went on to win a total of 18 Olympic medals, thus becoming the most successful and consistent gymnast ever.         
	At the world championships in 1958, she competed while being pregnant but still won five gold medals.         
	Her daughter Tania was born 10 days before her 24th birthday.         
	The Rome Games in 1960 also witnessed Latynina at her best, winning three golds, two silver and one bronze in the majestic arena near the Spas of Caracalla.                   
	FLORENCE GRIFFITH-JOYNER         
	Name  Florence Griffith-Joyner         
	Country  US         
	Date of birth  1959-12-21         
	Birthplace  LA         
	Height  170 cm         
	Weight  59.0 kg         
	Disciplines  100m, 200m, relays         
	Olympic Games (5 medals: 3 gold, 2 silver)         
	Florence Griffith-Joyners flamboyant style on the track not only led to comments about the American sprinters colourful running apparel. Flo-Jo raised the stakes in such a way that the rest of the female athletics pack were left trailing behind.         
	However, her untimely death at the age of 38 could not prevent the doubters from querying whether her extraordinary feats were due, in part, to doping. Flo-Jos progress from 1984-87 was largely unremarkable.         
	But in 1988, Griffith-Joyner seemed physically transformed. In July, it was a noticeably more muscular athlete who showed up for the American Olympic selection heats. Her voice was also deeper and improvement was somewhat more evident  21.77 sec in the 200m and a phenomenal 10.49 sec in the 100m.                   
	SHANE GOULD         
	Name  Shane Gould         
	Country  Australia         
	Date of birth  1956-11-23         
	Birthplace  Sydney         
	Height  172 cm         
	Weight  60.0 kg         
	Discipline  freestyle, medley         
	Olympic Games (5 medals: 3 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze)         
	Like a rare orchid which blooms only when nature permits a 15-year-old Australian by the name of Shane Gould briefly held all the freestyle world records and also won five medals (3 gold) at the Munich Games of 1972 before withdrawing from competition forever at the age of just 17.         
	Compared to some of her adversaries, Goulds tale is one of sporting innocence. A childhood spent in the lagoons around the islands of Fiji was the perfect playground for the energetic youngster.         
	By the time her family had returned to Sydney, Goulds ease and style in the water had caught the eye of trainer Ken Wiles, who recognised winning potential in the 9-year-old.         
	The family worked and sacrificed to help her cause, but Goulds strict daily schedule ultimately contributed to her success.            
	KORNELIA ENDER  
	Name  Kornelia Ender         
	Country  GDR         
	Date of birth  1958-10-25         
	Birthplace  Plauen         
	Height  180 cm         
	Weight  75.0 kg         
	Disciplines  freestyle, butterfly, individual medley, relays         
	Olympic Games (8 medals: 4 gold, 4 silver)         
	Kornelia Ender was but a slight 13-year-old when claiming three Olympic silver medals in the pool at Munich 1972, an event at which the East German delegation had a very average outing. Four years later Ender and Co. simply swept the board, causing the Americans to openly question the validity of their adversaries victories in Montreal.         
	Years later, after a series of denials, former East German swimming coaches openly admitted to having systematically administered steroids, most, without the full knowledge of the young athletes involved.         
	Despite the blatant wrong doing, Enders talent as a swimmer is undeniable. With or without those drugs, it is feasible that the teenager, who was taken from her family home in Bitterfeld at the age of 6 to train in Halle as part of the governments programme for sporting recognition, would have met success.                   
	KRISZTINA EGERSZEGI         
	Name  Krisztina Egerszegi         
	Country  Hungary         
	Date of birth  1974-08-16         
	Birthplace  Budapest         
	Height  174 cm         
	Weight  57.0 kg         
	Disciplines  backstroke, butterfly, medley         
	Olympic Games (7 medals: 5 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze)         
	Step aside Mark Spitz and co because in the space of three Olympics between Seoul and Atlanta Hungarys Krisztina Egerszegi won five individual swim golds and ahead of Beijing is the only man or woman to have done so. Of course, the nine gold medals won by Spitz can not be ignored  however, five of his were won in relay events.         
	But deservedly, Egerszegi merits a special mention due to her domination in the pool, and a longevity of nine years.         
	The slight brown-haired, blue-eyed Budapest native first came to the publics attention at the Seoul Games in 1988- aged only 14.         
	In the South Korean capital she went head-to-head with East German Kristin Otto in the 100m backstroke, coming second in a time of 1:01.56. But three days later she collected her first Olympic gold by beating Kathrin Zimmermann and the double world champion, Cornelia Sirch, in the 200m backstroke.

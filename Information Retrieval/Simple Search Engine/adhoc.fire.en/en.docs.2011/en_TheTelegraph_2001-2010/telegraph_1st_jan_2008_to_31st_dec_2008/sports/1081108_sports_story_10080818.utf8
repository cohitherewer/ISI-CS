	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting and United SC, currently reeling at the tenth and 11th spots, respectively, in the I-League table, will look to bag full points when they meet at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	Mohammedan Sporting are currently on six points from half a dozen matches while their city counterparts are on five from as many games.         
	The black-and-white brigade garnered four points from their last couple of matches  beating Mahindra United 1-0 and holding East Bengal goalless  and would bank on their foreign strike duo of Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday for a win in Saturdays match.         
	Its not going to be easy United SC have a good mix of foreigners and local players.         
	No coach can just say were going to play for three points. Its going to be a good match, Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali said.         
	Sunday, who skipped practice on Thursday due to a toothache, will be in the starting line-up, the coach confirmed.         
	United SC would have to repeat their performance against JCT the other day to put it across Mohammedan Sporting.

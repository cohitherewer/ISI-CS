The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal climb to the top
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arsenal climb to the top
                      
	London: Arsenal beat Bolton 3-1 to jump to the top of the Premier League on Saturday after Liverpool were held 0-0 at home by Stoke City.         
	Although Kevin Davies headed Bolton into a 14th minute lead, the visiting Gunners scored twice in a minute through Emmanuel Eboue and Nicklas Bendtner to snatch the lead by the 27th minute and Denilson added a third in the 87th.         
	The victory gives Arsene Wengers team 12 points from five games although Chelsea, which has 10 points, can still regain the lead by beating Manchester United on Sunday.         
	West Ham beat Newcastle 3-1 in Gianfranco Zolas first game in charge in the Premier League on Saturday.         
	Steven Gerrard had a goal disallowed at Anfield as Liverpool, which beat Manchester United at home last week, moved to 11 points from five games.         
	Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez was furious that Gerrards freekick, which sailed into the net, did not count. The linesman had flagged for an offside against teammate Dirk Kuyt, who tried to head the ball but missed.         
	Zola was on the West Ham bench for the first time since the Italian replaced Alan Curbishley as manager, and he saw compatriot David Di Michele mark his first league start for the Hammers with two goals.         
	The first was a deflected eighth-minute shot. He netted the second in the 37th minute from close range after his first shot had been blocked by goalkeeper Shay Given.         
	Matthew Etherington added the third from Di Micheles mis-hit shot in the 53rd. Newcastle scored through Michael Owens curling shot in the 67th for his third goal of the season and his ninth in eight matches against the Hammers.         
	Two late goals by substitute Michael Chopra earned Sunderland a 2-0 victory over neighbours Middlesbrough after Stewart Downing had missed a penalty for Boro.         
	Blackburn edged Fulham 1-0 with Matt Derbyshire netting his third goal of the season in the 84th minute.         
	Five more games are being staged on Sunday, including the showdown between Chelsea, last seasons runner-up, and defending champion Manchester United at Stamford Bridge.

	Munich: Bhaichung Bhutia sizzled on a starry night with a spectacular brace in the Goal4africa charity match between two all-star international teams at the Allianz Arena here on Saturday.         
	Playing for the Edu team in jersey No. 30 under the captaincy of Dutch star Clarence Seedorf, Bhaichung scored in the 28th and 68th minutes though for a lost cause as the Michael Ballack-led Cation side won the match 9-6 at Bayern Munich home ground late last night.         
	The match, the first event of a two-year programme aimed at raising 90 million euros and inspired by Nelson Mandelas dream of education for all  all for education, lost much of the sheen with several top international stars missing out of it.         
	Kaka and Ronaldo, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Steven Gerrard and Didier Drogba did not turn up.         
	Arsenals Robin van Persie, AC Milan goalkeeper Nelson Dida, Dutch star Mark van Bommel, Italian World Cup winner Gennaro Gattuso and Bayern Munichs Ze Roberto were the few big names besides Ballack and Seedorf.         
	.In the 28th minute, Bhaichung made the scoreline 3-3 with a beauty of a goal. He chested down a Nigel de Jong aerial pass and blasted a left-footed half volley into the goal.         
	 In the 68th minute, Seedorf was alone with the opposition goalkeeper and the Dutch star sent a parallel pass to Bhaichung who had all the time in the world to just tap the ball into an empty net for his second goal.

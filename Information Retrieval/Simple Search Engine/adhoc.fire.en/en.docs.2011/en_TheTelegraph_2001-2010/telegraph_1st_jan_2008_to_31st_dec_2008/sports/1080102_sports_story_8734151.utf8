                                                   Wright bats for Sehwag

 - Indians are best when playing their shots, says former coach 
   A STAFF REPORTER
              
	Calcutta: John Wright says that India should open with Virender Sehwag to ease the pressure on Rahul Dravid. 
    
	The Indians are best when playing their shots. Sehwag certainly gave us a lot of momentum on the last tour I dont know what form he is in, but I just feel you have to be positive against Australia and put the bad ball away, the former India coach was quoted as saying in The Age. 
    
	[Sehwag, however, wont be playing in the second Test beginning in Sydney on Wednesday.] 
    
	Rahul looked to me as if he needs a bit of time at the crease. He is a big rhythm player and I am sure he prefers (number) three. 
    
	He succeeded in Australia last time so he has got that behind him. I just felt, looking from here, that the lead-in has been insufficient so Melbourne for any Indian batsman was going to be a very, very severe examination. The team needs him. 
    
	Wright is qualified to talk about the Indian team composition as he was in charge when India came close to winning the 2003-04 Test series Down Under, which eventually ended 1-1. 
    
	Australia bowled very well but you cant allow them to bowl at you, the New Zealander said about the Melbourne Test which the Aussies won by 337 runs. 
    
	Im probably biased, but he (Sehwag) gave us so much at the top of the order Hes the sort of player who needs to be backed and be given a lot of confidence to go out there  as long as he plays straight  and back himself. I would love to see him back in good form. Then Dravid can slot in at three and things follow from there. 
    
	Sehwag aggregated 464 in the four-Test series, including a strokeful 195 in Melbourne. Dravid tallied a staggering 619  including a matchwinning double hundred in Adelaide  at 123.80 an innings. 
    
	Dravid scored 21 runs off 180 balls in the Melbourne Test which India lost in under four days. He and Wasim Jaffer failed to provide a solid platform in either innings as India were bowled out for under 200 twice. 
    
	Sehwag, a last minute inclusion in the current squad, was not in the XI for the MCG Test.

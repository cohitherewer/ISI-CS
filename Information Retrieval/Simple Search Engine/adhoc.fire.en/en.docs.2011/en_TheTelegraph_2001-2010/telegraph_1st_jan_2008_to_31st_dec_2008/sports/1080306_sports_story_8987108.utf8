                                                   Im too tough for Aussies: Harbhajan
            SHARP SINGLES - Down Uunder                
	 Harbhajan Singh has fired a stunning final insult at Australia by insisting he was mentally superior to the world champions and had clearly won the battle of the minds. Harbhajan insisted crowd abuse and sledging from the Australians had backfired in spectacular fashion. I was too mentally tough for the Australians, Thursdays edition of The Daily Telegraph quoted Harbhajan as saying.         
	I was proud of the way our team played and I believe we have the potential to be No.1 side in the world, he said.         
	Ponting admission         
	 A Jaded Ricky Ponting has taken personal responsibility for Australias one-day wipeout and confessed he had no answers for his awful form slump, according to the Herald Sun. Ponting, who is soon to become a father, with wife Rianna 15 weeks pregnant, has been told to turn his phone off, put his feet up and forget about cricket for the time being. My form has been awful right throughout the series, he said.         
	When you are batting at No. 3, you need to take up a lot of that responsibility and be a consistent run-scorer and I havent been that in this series. I am as guilty as anyone for that.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev slips on Day II
                      
	Adare: Michael Lorenzo-Vera of France shot a 2-under 70 to move into the lead on Day II of the Irish Open on Friday.         
	Overnight leader Jeev Milka Singh of India slipped to tied 11 after carding a four over 76 for a two-day aggregate of two-under 142.         
	His overnight co-leader, Richard Green, shot a 74 for be tied third with a four under 140 total.         
	Marcel Siem of Germany was in sole second place with a 5-under 139 after carding a 71.         
	The other three Indians in the fray all missed the cut.         
	Both Indian Masters champion S.S.P. Chowrasia and Shiv Kapur ended the day at tied 69.         
	Chowrasia carded a dreadful seven over 79 on Friday for a two-day total of four over 148. He had ended Day I at tied seventh with a three under-69.         
	Shiv finished with a 76 (four over 148). On Thursday, an even par 72 helped him finish Round I in tied 30th place.         
	Jyoti Randhawa, who fired a four over 76 to be tied 95th after the first day, slipped even further to tied 104 after carding a 75 to be seven over 151 for the tournament.         
	The Irish Ryder Cup duo of Darren Clarke and Paul McGinley moved into contention after carding 69s, although McGinley bogeyed three of the last seven holes after making birdies on five of the first 11.         
	Clarke, who won his first European Tour event in five years at the Asian Open three weeks ago, had a steadier round of five birdies against two bogeys. Clarke was on 3-under, one shot ahead of McGinley.         
	Bradley Dredge, who lost a play-off to Padraig Harrington last year, led briefly on 7-under but four bogeys over the last eight holes knocked him back to 3 under.

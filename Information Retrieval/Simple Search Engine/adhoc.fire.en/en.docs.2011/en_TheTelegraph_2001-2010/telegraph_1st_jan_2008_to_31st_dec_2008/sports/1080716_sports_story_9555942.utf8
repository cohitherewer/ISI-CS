The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It is sad, says Ramiz
                                                                                                                                                                                                       It is sad, says Ramiz

	Karachi: Former Pakistan greats have urged the cricket board not to show any mercy to tainted pacer Mohammed Asif.         
	It is time the PCB stopped supporting players who are constantly bringing a bad name to the country. Only time will tell if he is innocent or not but there is no doubt that Asif has been responsible for spoiling the image of Pakistan cricket not once but a number of times, former captain Javed Miandad said.         
	Miandad also blamed the board.         
	The players are responsible for their behaviour but at the same time the board has encouraged them to indulge in indiscipline by constantly ignoring their past acts and refusing to get tough, he added.         
	Former captain Zaheer Abbas said Asifs positive test was sad news for Pakistan cricket as it was not the first time he had been linked to a doping scandal.         
	I just can not understand why Pakistan cricketers are using drugs. I think the PCB management is unable to restrict players on such issues that is why theyre enjoying all liberties, he said.         
	Former captain Moin Khan too was not so sympathetic towards Asif.         
	His behaviour shows irresponsibility because if youre a player and representing your national team then youre the ambassador of the country, so you should not do things which give bad name to the country, he said.         
	Its been happening constantly, I think the board should do something because it is not good for the country. So they have to take hard steps, he added.         
	Former captain and commentator Ramiz Raja said Asif would have to reap what he had sowed.         
	I feel sorry that we could lose such a potentially good bowler. It is sad. But this latest doping scandal involving one of our players shows that perhaps the player have lost the respect and fear of the authorities, he said.

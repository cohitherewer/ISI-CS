                                                     Coachs parting shot: Karnam dopes
                  Malleswari                     
	Patiala: Indias outgoing weightlifting coach Magad Salama on Thursday dropped a bombshell hours before leaving the country alleging that Olympic bronze medallist Karnam Malleswari avoided dope tests because she feared testing positive.         
	When a team from the World Anti-Doping Agency came to the camp, Malleswari became an official of the (Indian weightlifting) federation and soon after the officials left she went back to being a camper, said Salama, who has had a very brief stint with the Indian team.         
	Before leaving the NIS complex, he told reporters that the Commonwealth Games gold medallist was also not fit for the sport and that the IWF has been protecting dope offenders.         
	Salama quit after a lengthy row with federation chiefs. He had forwarded his resignation to SAI on January 23.         
	The Egyptian had wanted to select the team for the Asian Championships in Kanazawa City, Japan, based on his assessment.         
	His proposal included the elimination of the entire old guard including Kunjurani Devi and Malleswari and at least four other seniors but that was not acceptable to the Indian officials.         
	Malleswari expressed surprise over Salamas allegations. I cannot understand what he is saying and why he is saying it. I am surprised he is targeting me. I have not trained under him...         
	The present camp started on February 20 and all the senior and junior girls were tested. Even today the officials and doctors checked my room. Any time and any where, I am always open for a test, she said. (PTI)

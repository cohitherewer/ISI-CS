	 This Test is the 13th to be staged at this ground and the second since the stadium was rebuilt after the tsunami.         
	 Three of the last 5 Tests played on this ground were drawn.         
	Of the 12 Tests played at this venue, the team that has won the toss has batted first on all occasions except two. The first was in August 2001 when Sri Lanka won the toss and put India in to bat. Lanka won that match by 10 wickets. The second in December 2007 when England won the toss, and put Sri Lanka in, and only just managed to hang on to a draw.         
	India are playing their second Test at this venue. Only Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan have made Test appearances on this ground.         
	When on 80/0, India recorded their best ever partnership for any wicket on this ground. The previous best was 79 by the first wicket pair of Shiv Sundar Das and Sadagopan Ramesh in 2001-02.         
	 When on 62, Virender Sehwag brought up the highest individual score by an Indian on this ground. Rahul Dravid had made 61 in the only Test India played in August 2001. Dravid was the only player to register a fifty plus score in that match that India lost by 10 wickets.         
	Sehwag and Gambhir brought up their third century opening stand in Test cricket.

	Dravid when he opened his account became the second highest run scorer for India in Tests. He now moves to No. 5 in the list of top run-getters in Tests  Brian Lara (11953 in 131 Tests), Sachin Tendulkar (11821 in 149 Tests), Allan Border (11174 in 156 Tests), Steve Waugh (10927 in 168 Tests), Dravid (10124 in 124 Tests)

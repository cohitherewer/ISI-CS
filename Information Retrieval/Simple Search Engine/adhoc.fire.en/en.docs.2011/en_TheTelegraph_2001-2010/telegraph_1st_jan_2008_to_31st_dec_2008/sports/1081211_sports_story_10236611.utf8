The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mourinho still high on confidence
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mourinho still high on confidence
                      
	Milan: Although Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho believes a tough draw in Februarys Champions League last 16 will shock his side out of their European malaise, the damage may already have been done.         
	The Serie A champions have remained true to Italian form by limping through the group stages, losing twice, drawing twice and winning convincingly only once.         
	They had already qualified for the knockout stages ahead of Tuesdays game at Werder Bremen but Mourinho still wanted a win.         
	Mourinho, picked to replace Roberto Mancini in June mainly because of his Champions League pedigree, did not mince his words when laying into his players after last months lifeless 0-1 home defeat to Panathinaikos.         
	He has tried a different tactic following the Werder defeat, hinting that his side will only rise to the occasion against big teams.         
	The real bad luck will be for the top side in another group who will draw a tough team like Inter, Mourinho told reporters. I am sure that we will see the true Inter at the end of February.

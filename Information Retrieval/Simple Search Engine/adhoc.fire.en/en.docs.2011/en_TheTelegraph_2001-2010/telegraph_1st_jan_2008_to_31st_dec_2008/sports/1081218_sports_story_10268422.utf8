                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kirsten reveals Yuvi secret
                      
	Mohali: India coach Gary Kirsten has revealed that Yuvraj Singh rediscovered his form in the Chennai Test against England after being asked to pretend that he was playing a one-day knock.         
	Comeback man Yuvraj, who flopped in the first innings scoring only 14, more than made up for it with an 85 in the second essay as India clinched a memorable six-wicket victory.         
	Yuvraj has felt the heat but you need just one innings to turn it around. We told him to pretend he was playing a one day innings, and to play positively, Kirsten told a TV channel.         
	Kirsten said even when England were on top, he was confident of an Indian win. England were on top but we still felt that we could win. Then it was up to England to make a plan. We went into the fifth day saying that we could do it, he said.         
	We were sure that we could make it. I had seen Sehwag play and knew what he was capable of and Sachin was of course equally good, he added.         
	India chased down 387, riding on Sachin Tendulkars magnificent 41st hundred. Kirsten said even when not in the best of forms, Tendulkar is a confidence booster in the dressing room.

                                                   Saurabh shines in win over England
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: An unbeaten 98 from Saurabh Tiwary made it sure that Indias final preparation for the ICC Under-19 World Cup went off without a hitch on Wednesday. The Indian youngsters saw off their English counterparts at the Royal Military College, Kuala Lumpur, by six wickets.         
	But it was far from straightforward for the side being coached by Dav Whatmore. Chasing Englands 219 for eight, India lost their first three wickets for just seven runs as pacers Steven Finn and James Harris made early inroads.         
	A 134-run partnership between Saurabh and Tanmay Srivastava calmed Indias nerves and ensured a relatively trouble-free run-chase. Saurabhs unbeaten 98 came off 115 balls and included 11 fours and three sixes.         
	Earlier, Englands Dan Redfern and Ben Brown shared a 113-run partnership for the sixth wicket after a shaky start had reduced the 1998 champions to 95 for five. But captain Virat Kohli (two for 40) and allrounder Tanmay (two for 36) made it sure that Englands total never went out of reach.         
	Defending champions Pakistan made up for their first warm-up defeat to England with a five-wicket win over Bangladesh at Club Aman.         
	Ahmed Shahzad (79 not out) anchored the innings as Pakistan successfully chased Bangladeshs 203. Shahzad shared an impressive opening partnership of 89 with Umer Akmal  younger brother of Pakistan senior wicketkeeper Kamran. The chase was never in doubt as Iman Wasims team was always ahead of the rate.         
	In the last warm-up of the day, a fine knock of 98 from George Worker and then a six-wicket haul from Nick Beard saw New Zealand coast to a win over Ireland.

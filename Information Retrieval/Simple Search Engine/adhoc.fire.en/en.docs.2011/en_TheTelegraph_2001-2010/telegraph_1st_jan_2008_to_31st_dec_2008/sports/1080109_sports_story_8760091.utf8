The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger aims for a clean sweep
                                                Tiger aims for a clean sweep
                                Tiger Woods    
	Los Angeles: Although the 2008 PGA Tour is just one week old, speculation is mounting that Tiger Woods could achieve golfs Holy Grail by sweeping all four majors for a calendar Grand Slam.         
	Woods himself alluded to the possibility last week and most of his peers accept it is extremely foolhardy to rule anything out where the runaway world No. 1 is concerned.         
	The feat has never been accomplished in the professional game but Woods came desperately close with his so-called Tiger Slam after winning the 2001 Masters.         
	His two-shot victory at Augusta National meant he held all four majors at the same time, following his wins at the US Open, British Open and PGA Championship the previous year.         
	I think its easily within reason, Woods said of a possible calendar slam on his web site last Friday.         
	Woods, who has occupied top spot for a record 477 weeks, has 19.22 average rankings points, more than double that of world No. 2 Phil Mickelson (8.55). He clinched his 13th major at the PGA Championship last August and totally outclassed his rivals by winning five times in his last six starts of the season.         
	Woodss caddie Steve Williams says he has never seen him strike the ball as well. Should he replicate that form in this years four majors, that elusive calendar slam is there for the taking.

                                                   Strategy paid off: Mondal

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Habibur Rehman Mondal, who was adjudged Man of the Match for his stellar work in Bagans 2-1 victory over Churchill Brothers at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday, said that a specific strategy helped them blunt Okolie Odafe, the Goan sides main weapon. 
    
	We knew that we had to keep a check on Odafes movements. The early goal obviously helped us a lot too, Habibur said after the match. 
    
	According to Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira, who looked relieved after the crucial win, star striker Jose Ramirez Barreto is more technically sound than Nigerian Okolie. 
    
	Both are good but I feel Barreto is technically stronger, Pereira said.

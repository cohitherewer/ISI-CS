                                                   Hayden doubtful for Perth

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Australia opener Matthew Hayden has sought acupuncture help to try and save his immediate Test future but said he could be out for a month with a mysterious hamstring injury. 
    
	The opener said hes hopeful of taking on India in Wednesdays Perth Test but knows he is far from certain of passing a searching strength test on the weekend. 
    
	Doctors say Hayden could be out for between one and five weeks. 
    
	That is fair to say, it is really too hard to tell at the moment, Hayden was quoted as saying in The Herald Sun. 
    
	Ive been basically resting this week and I dont know theres anything more I can do. I just have to let it heal. 
    
	I am going to fly over to Perth and Ive got until the weekend to have some more treatment. I am hopeful (of playing). I am not too sure. 
    
	Hayden has been named in Australias unchanged squad for the third Test but it is understood selectors considered putting prolific West Australian opener Chris Rogers on standby. 
    
	Rogers will be shoe-horned into the side should Hayden be unfit but selectors want to give the injured Queenslander every chance to play. 
    
	Hayden has this week had several sessions of acupuncture to try to speed up his recovery. 
    
	The acupuncture helps him relax and decreases muscle spasm around the injury, Australian physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said. It is a treatment he has responded pretty well to in the past. 
    
	Hayden will fly to Perth with the rest of his teammates where he will be put through his paces by Kountouris. His fitness test will involve several strength tests which will show whether the injury has improved. If it hasnt, Hayden is likely to be ruled out immediately and Rogers drafted in. 
    
	It will be a strength test where he will use his legs to push against me, in a couple of different ways at a couple of different angles, Kountouris said. I will be looking to see the improvement he has made, if any. If he hasnt made any improvement it really decreases his chances of playing.

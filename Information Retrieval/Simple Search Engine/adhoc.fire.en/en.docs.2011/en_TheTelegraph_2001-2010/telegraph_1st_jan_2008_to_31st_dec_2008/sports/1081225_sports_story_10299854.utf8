The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Post-Warne Australia hit by dearth of spinners
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Post-Warne Australia hit by dearth of spinners

	As Nathan Hauritz replaces fellow off-spinner Jason Krejza in Australias squad for the Boxing Day Test, the rest of the cricket world is wondering whatever happened to Shane Warnes legacy. Where are all those devilish young tweakers and twirlers who were supposed to follow in the great mans footsteps?         
	Fourth-innings run-chases used to be fruitless exercises against Australia, who could rely on Warne, and sometimes his deputy, Stuart MacGill, to bamboozle all comers on any pitch with a hint of spin. Now that these two magicians have retired, there is a sense of predictability about Australias attack, a lack of mystery that South Africa exploited superbly in Perth.         
	Krejza might have been expected to run through a team on a fifth-day pitch, yet he failed to make any impact on the accomplished South African batting, and his economy rate of more than four runs an over meant that he could not be used to close up an end.         
	Hence the selection of Hauritz, a less attacking bowler than Krejza but a more reliable one.         
	It is tempting to blame the Australian authorities for this spinning shortfall. Have they lapsed into complacency, in the same way that the West Indies board allowed their fast-bowling production lines to fall into disuse in the glory years of Michael Holding and Malcolm Marshall? Most experts Down Under say otherwise.         
	They believe that this is a cyclical dry spell, caused less by any inactivity in the coaching department than by natural variation.         
	Australian cricket has not sat on its hands, says Kerry Keeffe, a leg-spinner who played 24 Tests for Australia in the 1970s. We had a stack of promising talent  just think of Hauritz, Krejza, Beau Casson, Dan Cullen and Cullen Bailey  and we were waiting for one of them to take the next step up. The trouble is, nobody has.         
	It was the same with Warne. He got off to a rocky start when he went around the park in his first Test. But then he made that step up. My worry is that none of these young blokes will manage it. You cant blame the system, because it has thrown everything at them.         
	Of the bowlers mentioned by Keeffe, only Casson, a left-arm wrist-spinner, would seem to have the X-factor required to trouble top international batsmen.         
	Casson is just 25, a good batsmen and fielder, and he took three important wickets on his Test debut against the West Indies in June. But that did not save him from being abruptly discarded by the selectors. The decision has never been satisfactorily explained.         
	Casson was poorly treated, Keeffe says. Even so, I dont know whether he is the real deal. Whenever Ive watched him, he has looked over-dependent on the wrong un for his wickets. The stock ball was just there to set the batsman up. Id say the same about Amit Mishra, the Indian leggie who has just come on the scene.         
	That was the thing about Warne and MacGill  those two guys would get you out with their leg-break. OK, so they had few other tricks in their kitbag, but they were really just the frills on top. If youre going to take 300 Test wickets, a really good stock ball is an essential starting point.

	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who celebrated his 36th birthday on Tuesday, hopes to do well in the Sri Lanka series.         
	With the national selectors retaining him in the 16-member squad for the three-Test series in Sri Lanka starting on July 18, Sourav felt there was no reason to be excited to see his name on the team list.         
	I was always there in the Test squad; so theres no need to get excited. Ill look to give my 100 per cent and do well in the Sri Lanka series, he said.         
	Refusing to comment on the selection, Sourav said he was yet to see the team list. Im happy for the youngsters (Rohit Sharma and Pragyan Ojha). They are doing pretty well... We hope to do well in Sri Lanka.         
	The birthday boy also said there was nothing extraordinary planned for the day.         
	There was no special wish for my birthday... Also, theres no special celebration... I would like to spend the day with my family, he said.

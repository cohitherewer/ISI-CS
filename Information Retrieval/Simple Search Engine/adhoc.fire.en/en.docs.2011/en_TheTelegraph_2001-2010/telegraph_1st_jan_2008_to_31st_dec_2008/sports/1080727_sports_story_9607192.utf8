	Perform or perish, PCB tells Malik  Karachi: Under-fire Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik has been issued a stern warning by PCB to either show results in the next few series or face the axe. In a meeting of the PCB rsquo;s international cricket committee in Lahore, Malik was given a tongue lashing by senior officials of the board over his performance as captain and the failure of the team to reach the Asia Cup final.  An eyewitness who attended the meeting said there was a heated exchange of words between the captain and the selectors. ldquo;The captain, coach and manager disagreed on some issues and Malik was rebuked by some governing body members including Munir Hafeez, Ejaz Butt, Intikhab Alam and Shafqat Naghmi, the chief operating officer of the board, rdquo; the witness said.    
	 PCB defiant  Karachi: With pressure mounting on the ICC to review its decision to award the Champions Trophy to Pakistan, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday said it does not see the possibility of any boycott and is confident of hosting a quality event. ldquo;We don rsquo;t believe any team will boycott the Champions Trophy because the entire cricket world is backing us and the ICC is satisfied that we are doing our best to provide the best security for the event, rdquo; PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi said.    
	 Focus on Tanvir  Karachi: Left-arm seamer Sohail Tanvir rsquo;s behaviour is under the scanner after captain Shoaib Malik complained to the PCB about the pacer rsquo;s refusal to adhere to team discipline.     
	 Deal vetoed   London: India batsman V.V.S Laxman rsquo;s planned move to Nottinghamshire has fallen through after the deal was vetoed by the BCCI, the English county said. The 33-year-old had been expected to arrive at Trent Bridge in August after Nottinghamshire had received a no-objection certificate from the BCCI two weeks ago.     
	Kent through   Southampton: Kent became the first team to reach England rsquo;s Twenty20 Cup final on Saturday, beating Essex by 14 runs to earn a spot in the inaugural Champions League. Essex had appeared to be cruising as it chased down the defending champions rsquo; 173 for seven wickets, but a pair of late run outs swung the match back toward Kent and Essex could only make 159/8.

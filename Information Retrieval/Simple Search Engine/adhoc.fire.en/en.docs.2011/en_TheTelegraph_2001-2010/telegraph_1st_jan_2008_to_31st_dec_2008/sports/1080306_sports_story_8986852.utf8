                                                   Follow youth policy: Aussie media
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Out with the old, in with the new, was the common sentiment among the Australian media which castigated the veteran Australian squad and said they must follow Indias youth policy.         
	The following are excerpts from Australian newspapers (alphabetically)         
	THE AGE: All summer long, India have been coming on strong. After a hesitant beginning to the tri-series, they swarmed all over Australia to win both finals. Like the streaker, Australia were caught with their pants down. In the one-dayers, India stole the initiative, pensioning off Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman but retaining Sachin Tendulkar and introducing a clutch of anonymous and fluffy-faced youth. Here was boldness on a scale not even Australia had previously shown.         
	THE AUSTRALIAN: It is the second successive year Australia have lost the tri-series finals but this failure is of far greater significance. Last year, Australia went on to win a third successive World Cup, and for a second time without losing a match. However, from that side, Adam Gilchrist and Brad Hogg are retiring, Shaun Tait has walked away from cricket for the moment and Matthew Hayden, Australias stalwart in the finals with 82 in Sydney and 55 last night, is 36. By contrast, India picked a young side.         
	THE DAILY TELEGRAPH: Indias stunning victory has proved the day is arriving when Australia will no longer be the best team in the world. The Indian team which trumped Australia contains just one player  Sachin Tendulkar  over 30. Australia, by contrast, had just three players  James Hopes, Michael Clarke and Mitchell Johnson  under 30. Earlier this week India stormed to victory in the under-19 World Cup. They are a nation on the rise.         
	HERALD SUN: India have made the first bold steps towards challenging Australias dominance in world cricket.         
	SYDNEY MORNING HERALD: A match jam-packed with desperate action has brought a pulsating summer to an appropriately dramatic conclusion. It has been a colossal struggle between an ageing champion and a bold challenger.

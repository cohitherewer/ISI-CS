	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riderss first camp would be held at the Eden from April 12. According to an official of franchise owner Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd, coach John Buchanan would step in couple of days prior to that. No confirmation, however, was available on when Australia captain Ricky Ponting would land in the city.      
	Meanwhile, CAB president Prasun Mukherjee admitted on Monday that the organisation is lagging behind as far as ticket sales is concerned. Tickets for the other seven venues would be available online from Tuesday.      
	As of now, we still dont know when the tickets would be available. We are trying to expedite the process. But its not in our hands, he said.      
	The agency that was supposed to handle the issue is facing a few teething problems. A high-level Red Chillies delegation would arrive on Wednesday. Hopefully, we will wrap it up as soon as possible.      
	In Chandigarh, Bollywood star Preity Zinta launched Kings 11 Punjab at the PCA Stadium.      
	She introduced captain Yuvraj Singh, Irfan Pathan, Sreeshanth, Piyush Chawla and other players besides coach Tom Moody. The logo of the team was also unveiled.      
	The official anthem of Kings XI Punjab has been sung by Daler Mehendi, who made a special guest appearance.      
	Moody said: I am very excited about the team as we have some of the best players with us. Kings XI Punjab believes that the means are as important as the end.       
	While winning is what our team would be playing for, playing in the right spirit and fairness is also very important for us.      
	Kings XI Punjab play their first match against Chennai on April 19.

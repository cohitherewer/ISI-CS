	London: Chelsea missed the chance to reclaim top spot in the Premier League when they were held to a 1-1 home draw by West Ham United on Sunday, a day after Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal also drew.         
	Craig Bellamy put West Ham ahead after 33 minutes but Nicolas Anelka finished off a neat move with his 14th league goal of the season to secure a point six minutes into the second half.         
	Liverpool, who were held to a 2-2 draw by Hull City at Anfield, lead the way on 38 points with Chelsea on 37. Manchester United, goalless at Tottenham Hotspur, are third on 32 but with a game in hand.         
	Arsenal slipped to fifth on 30 after drawing 1-1 at Middlesbrough, allowing Aston Villa to go fourth on 31 after they beat Bolton Wanderers 4-2.         
	In Sundays other game Newcastle United collected their first away win of the season when second-half goals from Michael Owen, Obafemi Martins and Danny Guthrie earned them a 3-0 victory at Portsmouth.         
	Dimitar Berbatov failed to shine on his return to Tottenham on Saturday when his Manchester United side drew 0-0 in the Premier League at White Hart Lane.         
	United went into the game knowing that victory would take them to within four points of leaders Liverpool, but the Bulgaria striker struggled in front of the fans who used to adore him and the defending champions needed goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar to make a couple of key saves.         
	Both teams could have won it in the last 10 minutes, with Park Ji-sung forcing a diving save from Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes before Luka Modrics curling shot from the edge of the area was just deflected onto the roof of the United net.         
	Both sides frequently misplaced passes on a surface made slick by steady rain all day, but Tottenham, perhaps surprisingly against a United team containing Berbatov, Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez, showed they were able to enliven the match with moments of skill.         
	David Bentley almost recreated the stunning goal he scored against Arsenal in October, drawing a diving save from Van der Sar with a long-distance volley, Luka Modric sent the ball over the bar with a full-length diving header and Aaron Lennons low shot from his mazy run down the left was only just blocked by Van der Sar.

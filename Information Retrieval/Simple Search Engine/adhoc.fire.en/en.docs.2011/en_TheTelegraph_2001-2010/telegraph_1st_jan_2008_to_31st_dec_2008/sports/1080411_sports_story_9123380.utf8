	New Delhi: Sania Mirza will undergo surgery on her troublesome right wrist in Miami which would put her out of action for at least four weeks.         
	A recent MRI showed contusion of her lunate bone with some inflammation and a suspected tear in the volar capsule. She is undergoing arthroscopy to repair the capsule and to clean out debris formed from chronic inflammation, a Globosport press release said. (PTI)

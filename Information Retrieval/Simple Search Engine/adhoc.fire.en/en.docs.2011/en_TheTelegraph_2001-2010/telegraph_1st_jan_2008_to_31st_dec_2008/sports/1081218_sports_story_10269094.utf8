The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Form vs record in derby

  - Federation Cup
  -   EB look to put an end to Bagans unbeaten streak at Salt Lake Stadium         A STAFF REPORTER            Sunil Chetri and Nirmal Chetri during practice at the East Bengal ground on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The 30th Federation Cup has witnessed empty stands so far. That might change on Thursday when East Bengal and Mohun Bagan resume their age-old rivalry at the Salt Lake Stadium, with a spot in the final and a place in the AFC Cup at stake.         
	For the players and the coaches, those two may be motivation enough but the fans have something more to be interested in. While die-hard Bagan supporters would want their team to extend the eight-match unbeaten streak against the archrivals at the Salt Lake Stadium, East Bengal fans would want to halt that run and taste victory for the first time this season.         
	On the eve of the match, both Stanley Rozario and Karim Bencharifa insisted that they were taking the match only as the semi-final of a tournament but they are obviously aware of the emotions this match generates.         
	For a tournament which has failed to generate public interest in the middle of a long season, Thursdays derby is the ideal medicine. The fact that it is the semi-final would ensure that the teams go all out for a win.         
	Bagan and East Bengal have advanced to the last-four stage in contrasting styles. While the red-and-gold brigade won all the group matches, scoring five goals and conceding none, Bagan had a roller-coaster ride. They were surprised by newcomers Oil India in the first match, but they managed to beat them.         
	Then Vasco Sports Club shocked them, winning 1-0 and putting Bagans semi-final berth at risk. A come-from-behind win over Air India finally saw the national club through.         
	The performance, naturally, has not satisfied Bagan coach Bencharifa but he pointed out that it is never easy to play against lowly teams who are determined to give more than hundred per cent against big teams like Bagan.         
	In a tournament like this, no team is easy. Small teams find extra motivation in playing us. They think were playing the second-placed team of the I-League, they are a big name in Indian football. So weve to prove ourselves against them, Bencharifa said.         
	Informing that the celebrated Bhaichung-Barreto pair is physically better now, the coach said he has the full squad at his disposal. There are no injury worries.         
	Rozario, too, does not have to worry about injuries. Even Suley Musah and Subrata Paul, who had been injured, are fit now.         
	Asked if his boys were thinking about returning to winning ways in the derby this season, the East Bengal coach said: This is an important match because it is the semi-final against the archrivals. I think this is motivation enough. Were not thinking about the match as anything more that that.         
	Unlike his counterpart, Rozario is happy with his teams performance so far in the Federation Cup. Im extremely happy with the way things have gone. This will stand us in good stead for the I-League also, he remarked. If we play with the same spirit Thursday, we can win.         
	Rozarios team seemed to have picked up the defending champions ego at the right time. After the gruelling group matches, it remains to be seen if Bencharifas boys have enough strength left in them to go the distance.

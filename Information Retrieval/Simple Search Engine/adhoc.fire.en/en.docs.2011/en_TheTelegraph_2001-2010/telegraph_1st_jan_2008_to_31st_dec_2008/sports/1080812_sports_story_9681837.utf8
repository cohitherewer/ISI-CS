The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Phelps dream stays alive
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Phelps dream stays alive
                      
	Beijing: Michael Phelps pumped the air in joy after teammates rescued his Olympic dream with a thrilling fightback against France in the 4x100 freestyle relay.         
	Hosts China picked up three more golds on the third day of competition and top the medals table with nine. But the day belonged to Phelps, or more precisely to teammate Jason Lezak, who came from half a length behind on the final lap of the relay to win gold for the Americans.         
	Phelps, who now has two golds, will need both stamina and luck if he is to surpass Mark Spitzs record of seven in 1972.         
	The Americans took nearly four seconds off the world record, a big margin in swimming. In all, five relay teams beat it, while Eamon Sullivan claimed the individual world record from Bernard when he led the Australian team off on the first lap.         
	Having won six golds in Athens, Phelps needs only two more to have the most golds by any Olympian.         
	There was plenty more drama in the pool, as Rebecca Adlington won Britains first Olympic womens swimming title in nearly half a century with a last-gasp victory in the 400m freestyle.         
	The tennis tournament got into full swing after rain delays, Spains Rafael Nadal survived a scare to defeat Italian Potito Starace 6-2 3-6 6-2. Switzerlands Roger Federer shook off recent wobbles to cruise through in straight sets, while Serena Williams also recorded a comfortable win in the womens first round.         
	The hosts hope to topple the United States from the top of the final medals table, to underline their growing might. But the weight of expectations may be getting to their shooters, another gold hopeful failing in the womens trap.         
	It was a happier story for China in diving, with a second gold in two days thanks to a near-perfect performance by Lin Yue and Huo Liang in the mens synchronised 10m platform. They also added two weightlifting golds to their medal haul on Monday.         
	Most eyes on Tuesday will be back on Phelps now as he steps up his record bid in the 200m freestyle final.           (REUTERS)

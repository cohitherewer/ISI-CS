The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Scrapped, postponed, to be moved out too...
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Scrapped, postponed, to be moved out too...
  - OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL CRICKET TAKE A HIT
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Overnight, the glare has shifted from Pakistan to India, with multiple strikes by terrorists in Mumbai hitting cricket hard.         
	Both official and unofficial.         
	The ODI series against England has been casualty No.1, with the last two matches (Guwahati, Delhi) being called off, as the Board put it.         
	Englands media manager Andrew Walpole, though, told The Telegraph that the ODIs had been postponed.         
	Apparently, the team management had a meeting in Bhubaneswar late on Wednesday, after returning from Cuttack, where it emerged that nobody wished to continue.         
	Its another matter, of course, that the Kevin Pietersens may have reacted very differently had England been on the verge of winning the seven-match series instead of being down 0-5.         
	Englands decision was conveyed to Board secretary N. Srinivasan on Thursday morning. He couldnt, obviously, convince the visitors to change their mind.         
	Significantly, Pietersen and Co. were never keen on playing in Guwahati (on Saturday), which had seen blasts as recently as last month.         
	Its not confirmed, but the visitors are likely to leave for London via Delhi on Friday.         
	For much of the day, next months two-Test series had become doubtful as the second match is supposed to be in Mumbai, from December 19. The air cleared late at night, but its certain that the second Test is going to be shifted.         
	A rotation system is supposed to be followed by the Board, but Calcutta was discriminated against when the international fixtures for 2008-09 were finalised.         
	In all fairness, therefore, the Mumbai match should come to the Eden. Board vice-president Lalit Modi has, however, indicated that the Test may be moved to a southern city. Chennai, it would seem.         
	Its an evolving situation... Obviously, there are security concerns (over Mumbai)... Were in discussions, Walpole said, when contacted in Bhubaneswar.         
	The England and Wales Cricket Board will, clearly, be negotiating from a position of strength.         
	Given the mood, the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 has been postponed, for the second time, in fact.         
	Is it jinxed?         
	Even the World Series, organised by the rebel Indian Cricket League, has been cut short. In this hour of unprecedented tragedy in Mumbai, we would like to extend all our support to the citizens of India, explained Kapil Dev, the Leagues executive board chairman.         
	Talking of Mumbai, the majestic Taj Mahal Palace amp; Tower has been the Boards official hotel for decades and the happenings there would (among others) have deeply affected those from the fraternity who have enjoyed its classy hospitality.         
	The hotel has also seen cricketers romancing.         
	It was at the old coffee shop, Shamiana, exactly 14 Novembers ago, that Mohammed Azharuddin made probably his first public appearance with Sangeeta Bijlani.         
	That was hours after captaining India to a big win over the West Indies and while he was still married.         
	Others too have been seen in the company of head-turners.         
	Footnote: The mayhem in Mumbai has affected cricket-related private functions as well. Friday, for example, was to have seen Sourav Gangulys felicitation by Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee at a function hosted by Harshavardhan Neotia. That has been put off.

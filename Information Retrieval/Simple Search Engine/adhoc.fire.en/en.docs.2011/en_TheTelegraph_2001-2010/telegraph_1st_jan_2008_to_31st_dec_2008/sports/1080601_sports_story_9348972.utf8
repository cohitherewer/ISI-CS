	Paris: The Williams bandwagon rolled out of Roland Garros on Friday when sisters Venus and Serena were humbled in the third round by a pair of tenacious opponents who never lost belief.         
	A day after the French Open lost three top 10 seeds, including David Nalbandian and James Blake, 2002 champion Serena joined them at the exit queue as she roared and screamed her way to a 4-6, 4-6 mauling by Katarina Srebotnik.         
	The fifth seeds defeat also meant a new name would be engraved on the Suzanne Lenglen Cup next week as she was the sole former champion in the womens draw.         
	Exactly nine hours later, Venus completed a miserable day for the Williams clan when the eighth seed was outslugged, outthought and outgunned 5-7, 3-6 by Italys Flavia Pennetta.         
	When you go on court, you have to believe in yourself, said Pennetta after reaching the fourth round for the first time at the sixth attempt.         
	Triple champion Rafael Nadal, playing for the fourth day running in the rain-hit tournament, can look forward to a rest day at last after he crushed Finn Jarkko Nieminen 6-1, 6-3, 6-1.         
	Nadals potential semi-final opponent, third seed Novak Djokovic, took a nasty tumble on court but emerged unscathed for a 7-5, 6-4, 6-2 win over American Wayne Odesnik. The defeats of Odesnik and Williamses meant Robby Ginepri remained the sole American survivor in either singles draw.         
	David Ferrer reached the last 16 for a second time after a bruising three hour 35 minute dogfight with former world number one Hewitt.         
	The tenacious Australian came into the tournament with no sort of form behind him and a nagging hip injury curtailing his preparations. But he outslugged Ferrer for large parts of their encounter before finally succumbing 6-2, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 on Court Suzanne Lenglen.         
	Serenas loss cleared the way for a final showdown between Maria Sharapova and 2007 finalist Ana Ivanovic, the top two seeds who withstood some fierce resistance before marching on.         
	An erratic Ivanovic overcame a slight wobble in the first set before downing Denmarks Caroline Wozniacki 6-4, 6-1 to reach the fourth round, while Sharapova huffed and puffed her way to a 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 second-round win over American Bethanie Mattek.         
	But no amount of on-court dramatics could save Serena.         
	On the eve of the championships Serena had declared herself 100 percent fit but on Friday it was Srebotnik who always looked in better shape.         
	At 5-4 down in the first set, Serena was her own worst enemy. She smashed an easy overhead straight into the net and followed it up by fluffing a volley.         
	She reacted by bending over in disbelief and resting her forehead against the end of her racket handle.         
	Forty five minutes later, Serenas Paris sojourn was over.         
	While Ivanovic has so far managed to win all three of her matches in straight sets, the same cannot be said of Sharapova.         
	If the Russian wants to complete a career Grand Slam by lifting the title here, she will have to take a crash course in how to hit crisp winners following yet another scrappy display.         
	Britains Andy Murray was adamant that he had underlined his claycourt credentials despite succumbing 3-6, 7-6, 3-6, 5-7 to Spains Nicolas Almagro. While Murrays comments sounded rather bold given his record on red dirt, a trio of Frenchmen had plenty to shout about.         
	Paul-Henri Mathieu, seeded 18th, Michael Llodra and wildcard Jeremy Chardy, who had quelled Nalbandian in the previous round, rode a wave of passionate support to reach the last 16.         
	Third seed Jelena Jankovic stayed on course for a first Grand Slam title when she completed a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Slovakias Dominika Cibulkova in the third round.         
	The match had been halted in fading light on Friday at 7-5, 4-2, and an exhausting 30-shot rally on the first point on Saturday showed Cibulkova was in no mood to roll over.

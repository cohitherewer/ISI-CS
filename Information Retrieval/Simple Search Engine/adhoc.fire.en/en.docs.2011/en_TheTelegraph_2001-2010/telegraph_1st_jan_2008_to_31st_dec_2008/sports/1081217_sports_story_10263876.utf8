The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin is still as effective 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sachin is still as effective 
                  GUEST COLUMN     Geoffrey Boycott                      Sachin Tendulkar                            
	Losing this Test will take some getting over for England. For 90 per cent of the match they thought they were winning and had it in the bag. Everything was going their way and on the last morning they were favourites to win.         
	Remember, the ball was jumping, turning and behaving unpredictably. England will be going over and over how they managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.         
	The big danger is that it could eat away at some of the players. Fortunately for England they cannot dwell on it for too long as they will be in the thick of it again on Friday when the second Test starts. That hands them an opportunity to redeem themselves quickly and to save the series.         
	I take my hat off to England for sticking together and deciding to play in difficult circumstances. But it is a kick in the guts to lose. Even with Kevin Pietersen as captain, all the upbeat talk in the world will not cover up this defeat.         
	We saw a pitch that was under-prepared, mainly because the groundsman did not have enough time to work on the surface and get it to bind together.         
	The good thing for the batsmen was that it was slow and got slower. These days, unless you play regularly in Sri Lanka or India, you do not come across a pitch like this very often. I grew up on them in the 1960s. We used to get a number of them in county cricket. In Kent, Essex, and Yorkshire where they used a lot of grounds, often they were just club or park pitches.         
	On this type of slow, unpredictable turning surface the hardest time for a batsman is at the start of his innings. That is when you are vulnerable because the ball is turning and doing things. But once you get in, because it is so slow, you have time to wait and pick the length. As confidence grows it becomes much easier to bat.         
	I thought Andrew Strauss was absolutely superb and he played perfectly on this type of pitch. He came in, occupied the crease and made the bowlers work hard and wore them down. He was very careful in his shot selection. He stayed on the back foot and came forward only when he had to  the old English adage of if in doubt, play forward is rubbish.         
	Strauss scored in two areas: behind square on the leg-side and square on the off-side. Simply one word: brilliant. Especially when you remember he has had no cricket since September, except for a couple of hits in the Stanford circus. To make two hundreds in a Test and be on the losing team  my God, that would keep me awake at night, and I hope it doesnt have that effect on him. It was a fantastic performance.         
	Sadly, I cannot say the same for Monty Panesar. Shane Warnes comment is very appropriate. He basically said Panesar has not learned a thing in Test cricket. To be a great spin bowler, it is not enough to spin the ball and bowl it on a length ball after ball. Those are only the basics. You have to think batsmen out by subtlety and variation. You have to be able to cope with pressure. It demands a different mindset when you bowl in the fourth innings and have to get a team out to win the match.         
	For a spinner there is no bigger pressure than bowling at Indian and Sri Lankan batsmen, because they are brought up with spin and are very, very good at playing it. Monty simply has a lot to learn.         
	The opposite can be said for Sachin Tendulkar. While a bowler is under pressure to get wickets in the fourth innings, a batsman has to make runs and win the match. As a batsman it is not how many runs you make, but whether you do it when it matters. Tendulkar showed all his experience, skill and ability.         
	As he gets older he does not dominate bowling as he did in his younger days. He does not have the same range of shots and has to use his brain instead. It makes no difference because he is just as effective as he ever was.         
	This year alone he has made more than 1,000 runs in Test cricket at an average of over 50. As they age, all batsmen and bowlers must be able to fall back on what they have learned so that when that little bit of youthfulness has gone, you make up for it with experience and knowledge.         
	Panesar and Tendulkar are two opposites. Panesar has talent but has learned nothing. Tendulkar is brilliant and has learned everything.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

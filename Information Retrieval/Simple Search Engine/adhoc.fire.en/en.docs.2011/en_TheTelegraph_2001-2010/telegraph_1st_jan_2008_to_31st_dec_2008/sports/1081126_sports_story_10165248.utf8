	Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday dropped Rawalpindi from the itinerary for the home series against India and reiterated that shifting the series to a neutral venue would remain the last option for them.         
	PCB chairman Ejaz Butt met Indian high commissioner Satyabrata Pal here after which he announced that Rawalpindi was being withdrawn as a venue.         
	The step of withdrawing Pindi Cricket Stadium from the itinerary was taken as part of our overall security plan for the forthcoming series, Butt said.         
	Butt said he briefed the Indian high commissioner on the security steps being taken for the series which would feature three Tests, five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 match.         
	Pakistan interior secretary Kamal Shah told his Indian counterpart, who is in Islamabad for talks between the two countries, that Pakistan will make the best security arrangements for the Indian team.         
	Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik said he would use his visit to India for the Twenty20 Champions League to convince Indian players to tour Pakistan early next year.         
	I will do my best to convince them that it is safe to tour Pakistan. I will let them know how important it is for India to tour Pakistan on schedule, he said. (PTI)

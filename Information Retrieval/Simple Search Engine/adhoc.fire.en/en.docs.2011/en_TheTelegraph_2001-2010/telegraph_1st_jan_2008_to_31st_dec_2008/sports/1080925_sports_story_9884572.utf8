  - Former champion targets Tour Down Under             Lance Armstrong                           
	New York: Seven times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong said on Wednesday he would return to professional cycling in Australia next year and seek an eighth French win while promoting a global cancer awareness campaign.         
	I have decided to race my bicycle again, confirmed Armstrong, 37, a survivor of testicular cancer, as he launched the Live Strong Global Awareness Campaign in New York.         
	With this campaign we feel that by racing the bicycle all over the world, beginning in Australia, ending in France at the global summit, it is the best way to promote this initiative, its the best way to get the word out, said Armstrong.         
	An Australian politician said earlier on Wednesday that Armstrong would make his return to professional cycling at the Tour Down Under in January.         
	Armstrong, who retired after winning the 2005 Tour de France, unveiled his plans at former US President Bill Clintons philanthropic summit, the Clinton Global Initiative.         
	He plans a global summit to raise cancer awareness in Paris after the 2009 Tour de France.         
	I look forward to 2009, I look forward to racing again, said Armstrong. I cannot guarantee an eighth Tour victory, but I can guarantee you the Live Strong message will touch all aspects of our society.         
	Its not very often someone gets a chance to spend three or fours years away from something, step back, and then say to themselves, I sort of miss that, Id like to go back and do that again, he added.         
	The Texan has already been linked with the Astana team, where his former manager Johan Bruyneel is now in charge. (Reuters)

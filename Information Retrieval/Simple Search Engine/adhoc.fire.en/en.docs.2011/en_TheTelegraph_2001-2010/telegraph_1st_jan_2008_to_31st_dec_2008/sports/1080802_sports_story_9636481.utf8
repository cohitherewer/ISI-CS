The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Had no separate plans for Sehwag, says Mendis
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Had no separate plans for Sehwag, says Mendis
            A CORRESPONDENT            Ajantha Mendis                           
	Galle: Sri Lankan spin sensation Ajantha Mendis, who took his first five-wicket haul on Friday, said he had no big plans to bowl to Virender Sehwag, who scored a double century.               
	Following are excerpts               
	 On his first five-wicket haul         
	 I am very happy with my performance taking five-for in an innings for the first time, in only my second Test. Bowling with Murali on the other side gives me a lot of confidence. I hope to continue performing similarly in the future.         
	Whether he did something else when the Indians attacked him         
	I didnt have any different plans in mind when the batsmen attacked me. Because we kept our heads during that period, we were able to dismiss them. Although India were determined to attack my bowling I didnt come to the match with any definite plans, but I knew if I did the right things I would be successful.         
	The secret behind his confidence         
	I gained the inspiration and confidence to go out and bowl against some of the worlds best batsmen because of my training in the army which has hardened my outlook and helped bring discipline into my bowling.         
	If the pitch was different from the first Test         
	I dont see any difference bowling at the SSC pitch and here.         
	If he had separate plans for Sehwag         
	I didnt have any big plans bowling to Sehwag. I bowled the same way I bowled to others. Sehwag batted really well but towards the latter part of Sehwags innings I was looking more towards controlling him rather than attacking.         
	If he thought that he would take more wickets than Murali in an innings         
	I didnt think that I would take more wickets than Murali in a Test innings. I got the opportunity so I performed.         
	Whether all the media attention has changed him         
	I am more focused in my training, whenever I get free time I spend it with my parents. Basically my life has not changed much, despite all the media attention.

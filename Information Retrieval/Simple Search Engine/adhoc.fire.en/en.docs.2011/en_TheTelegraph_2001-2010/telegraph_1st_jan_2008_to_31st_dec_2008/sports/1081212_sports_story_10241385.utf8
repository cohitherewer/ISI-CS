                                                                                                                                                                                                     Grandmaster a role model, says Dhoni
                      
	Chennai: The All India Chess Federation(AICF) on Thursday felicitated Viswanathan Anand for retaining the World Chess Championship title.         
	Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni presented a one-carat diamond ring to Anand on behalf of the federation.         
	Anand, also celebrating his 39th birthday, thanked the federation. I think I will accept the ring in the spirit of brotherhood.         
	I remember the reception the federation gave me last year and again a very special reception this time. It really means a lot to me.         
	Anand said he felt great about doing his country proud: One of the most beautiful compliments I have received was the banner put up for me by Indian participants in Vietnam, right after my win in Bonn.         
	It is always wonderful when you mean so much to your country.         
	All of you shared my experience in Bonn so closely. It will inspire me in future.         
	On the ongoing Test series between England and India, Anand asked Dhoni to finish the match within the next three days.         
	I hope you will finish the game in the next three days, he said.         
	Earlier, Dhoni congratulated Anand for retaining the world title.         
	It is not only a happy occasion for chess lovers but for all Indians, he said.         
	Stating that none is equal to Anand in chess, Dhoni said: We have role models like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid in cricket and Anand is a role model in chess.         
	On a lighter vein, the Indian captain said he would beat the chess champion if the latter plays the game with his left hand.         
	The federation, on this occasion, presented a cheque of Rs one lakh to Abhijit Gupta, who became the junior world champion recently.           (PTI)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indias Davis Cup captain Leander Paes on Wednesday refused to comment on Bhaichung Bhutias decision to pull out of the Olympic torch relay.         
	Its his decision, Paes said. I cannot comment on it. As far as I am concerned, carrying the torch is a dream come true for me. I am excited and looking forward to it.         
	Echoing Paes sentiment, long jumper Anju Bobby George said: It is one of the happiest moments in my life. Of course it would be an even greater pleasure if we win medals in Beijing. Im happy to be part of the relay and it has my full support.         
	Former sprint queen P.T. Usha said: Im just thrilled to be here to run with the flame. I consider it as an acknowledgement of my achievements.         
	Other prominent sportspersons taking part in the event include Milkha Singh, GS Randhawa, Joytirmoyee Sikdar, MD Valsamma, Shiny Wilson, Ajit Pal Singh, Balbir Singh (Sr), Harbinder Singh, Zafar Iqbal, Aslam Sher Khan, Dhanraj Pillay, Mahesh Bhupathi, K Malleshwari, Kunjurani Devi, Jaspal Rana, Manavjit Singh, Abhinav Bindra, Madhumita Bisht, Khazan Singh, Ali Qamar, Raj Kumar Sangwan, Chetan Baboor and Satpal.         
	Anju also claimed that she has no problem with P.T. Usha.         
	There is no such controversy, its all created by the media, Anju said.         
	Usha, meanwhile, was reluctant to say anything about it.         
	I want to stay away from controversies. I want to make it clear that I did not say anything against her, she said.

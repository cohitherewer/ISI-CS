	Calcutta: Strengthened by the arrival of several star players from the national team, a buoyant East Bengal side will take on Mohammedan Sporting in a derby on Tuesday in the Sahara CFL Premier Division.         
	Revenge will certainly be on East Bengal players minds as Shabbir Alis men had beaten the red-and-gold brigade 3-1 in the first leg at the Salt Lake Stadium, with Theodore Sunday scoring a brace.         
	Mohammedan Sportings victory in the first leg had put the Liberian striker firmly under the spotlight and since then the deadly duo of Sunday and Mike Okoro has gone on to sink the fortunes of many a team. But things would be much more difficult this time.         
	East Bengal, who were forced to field six defensive players against George Telegraph in their last match, will welcome the return of players like Syed Rahim Nabi, Rennedy Singh and the in-form striker Sunil Chhetri.         
	The biggest boost, however, will be in the form of the outstanding Subrata Paul beneath the bars. Speaking after practice on Monday, Bhattacharjee ruled out Sanju Pradhan, Mehtab Hossain, Mehrajudddin Wadoo and Dharamjit Singh from the encounter on Monday because of injuries.         
	Bhattacharjee said, The inclusion of some of the national team players will no doubt be a big boost for me as I was struggling to field a proper side against George Telegraph I had to play certain players out of their positions simply because I had no other options. But one must also remember that it takes time for new players to gel with the side, more so because football is a team game and individual brilliance doesnt always count.         
	 We must win to keep the pressure off ourselves because if we drop points, well only invite more pressure on us which then culminates into mistakes on the field.         
	Mohammedan Sporting midfielder Mir Farooq Hyder will miss Tuesdays match because of personal reasons while East Bengals Alvito DCunha, who missed the last match because of injury, is likely to play a part on Tuesday.Brazilian Edmilson Marquez, still serving a showcause notice, will also miss out.   
	MOHAMMEDAN SPORTING (Key men)  
	Sheikh Azim  
	 Mohammedan Sporting rsquo;s central defender has to display a commanding performance to thwart East Bengal rsquo;s attacking intent. Azim didn rsquo;t particularly make a great start to the season but has been growing in confidence since. His heading prowess and tackling abilities have to be razor sharp in order to reign in Ashim Biswas and Sunil Chhetri.  
	Theodore Sunday  
	 The Liberian seems to be on a personal mission of becoming the top goal-getter in the league. A goal on Tuesday will put him ahead of Lalawmpuiya, into the sole lead. Sunday will have to use his pace and guile to evade the zonal marking that will be used to stop him. Any space offered by the East Bengal back four could be utilised well by Sunday.  
	EAST BENGAL (Key men)  
	Subrata Paul  
	 The East Bengal keeper rsquo;s reach and athleticism makes him a truly world class prospect. His fearless attitude and determination will be put to test against Sunday and Okoro. East Bengal will be breathing a lot easier with Paul back in goal. Paul rsquo;s commanding presence within the penalty box will be an added bonus during setpieces.  
	Sunil Chhetri  
	 This diminutive striker from Delhi is in the form of his life. No stranger to football in the monsoons in Calcutta (having played earlier for Mohun Bagan). Chhetri rsquo;s pace, energy and hunger for goals makes him a constant threat. If he co-ordinates well with fellow marksman Ashim Biswas, Mohammedan Sporting could be in for a torrid time.

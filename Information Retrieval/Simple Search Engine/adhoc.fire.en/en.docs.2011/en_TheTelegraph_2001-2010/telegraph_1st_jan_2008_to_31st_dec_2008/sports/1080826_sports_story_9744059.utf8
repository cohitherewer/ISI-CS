	New York: Olympic champion Elena Dementieva struggled to a 6-4, 7-5 victory over Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan in the first round of the US Open on Monday.         
	The Russian fifth seed saved two set points in the second set before clinching victory in one hour, 28 minutes to set up a second-round match against Pauline Parmentier of France.         
	Dementieva, the runner-up in 2004, was made to fight all the way by world number 78 Amanmuradova, but one break gave her the first set.         
	Amanmuradova led 5-3 in the second and had two set points in the 10th game, but Dementieva saved them both.         
	In the mens draw, 2008 French Open semi-finalist Gael Monfils had an easy 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 straight sets win over Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas.         
	The other big name in action was world No. 4 David Ferrer. The Spaniard beat Argentine Martin Vassallo Argueello 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-2.           (REUTERS)

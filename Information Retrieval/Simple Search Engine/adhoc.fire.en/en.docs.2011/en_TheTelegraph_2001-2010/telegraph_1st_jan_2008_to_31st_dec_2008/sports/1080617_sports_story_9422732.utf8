                                                                                                                                                                                                     EURO DIARY 
                      
	Injuries dilute Turkey joy   
	Geneva: Turkey have seven players injured or suspended ahead of Fridays Euro 2008 quarter final against Croatia. Emre Gungor, carried off in the second half of Sundays thrilling group A win over Czech Republic, is their biggest concern. He has a calf strain and may miss the rest of the finals, coach Fatih Terim told a news conference on Monday. Captain Emre Belozoglu has been sidelined with a hamstring problem since the opening defeat by Portugal and midfield partner Tumer Metin has a groin strain. To add to Turkeys woes, keeper Volkan Demirel is out of the quarter final after he was sent off for shoving Czech forward Jan Koller in injury time.  
	Time to savour         
	 Istanbul: Turkey poured praise on national team as fans celebrated late into Sunday and looked forward to a quarter final against Croatia. Turkey coach Fatih Terim, heavily criticised after their opening 2-0 defeat, was back in favour and told the country to enjoy the moment. Go out and celebrate, go out on the streets and savour this feeling, he told the fans, who obeyed by dancing, singing and driving around the streets of Istanbul, Berlin and Geneva, where the match was played, until the early hours of the morning.         
	Spain divided         
	 Neustift: Spains players were divided on Monday over who they would like to face in the quarter finals. Luis Aragoness side, already assured of top spot in group D, could play either Romania, France or Italy in the last eight. All three are difficult but from what Ive seen so far the way France play would suit us best, third choice goalkeeper Andres Palop told a news conference. On paper Romania are the weakest team in that group but they are a very tricky side to play against, said Albiol. On the other hand, France and Italy might wake up at any time, he said.         
	New pitch         
	 Vienna: Euro 2008 organisers said on Monday they were confident a new pitch being laid at Basels St Jakob Park, after heavy rain had damaged the previous turf, would be ready in time to stage Thursdays quarter-final. A torrential downpour during Wednesdays group A match between co-hosts Switzerland and Turkey, and further rain during the Swiss match with Portugal on Sunday night, left the pitch badly damaged, prompting the unusual decision by Uefa.         
	No wags         
	 Basel: The strains of Rule, Britannia! and God Save the Queen are missing from the European Championship along with Englands football team. Also missing as a result are wags (wives and girlfriends), tabloid fever and thousands of scary looking supporters cramming city squares drinking beer. Well in fact the squares are full of loud fans, but theyre chanting Deutschland, Deutschland or wrapping Turkish flags around themselves. Not once has a group of fans spent hour after hour in a stadium or a city centre beating incessantly on drums and playing trumpets to The Great Escape. There havent been any rousing choruses of the English standards.

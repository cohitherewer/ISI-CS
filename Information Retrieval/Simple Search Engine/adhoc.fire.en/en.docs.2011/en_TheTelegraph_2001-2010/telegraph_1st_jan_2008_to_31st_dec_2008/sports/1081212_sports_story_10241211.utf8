	Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt will travel to India to attend the Asian Cricket Councils executive body meeting in Chennai on Friday. He would use the visit to discuss the fate of the Indo-Pak series and the option of neutral venue with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	The Indo-Pak series is not on the agenda of the ACC meeting but it is a good platform to have direct talks with the Indian officials, Saleem Altaf, chief operating officer of the PCB, said. The matter is in the hands of two governments and we cant do anything. (PTI)

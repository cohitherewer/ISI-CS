The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Price paid for yawning, napping...
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Price paid for yawning, napping...
  - Bob Woolmer too deserves some credit for SA win       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Bob Woolmer                                 
	Calcutta: Minutes into Day II of the first Test, a TV camera caught an Indian bowler yawning. Minutes into Test No.2, our famed batting line-up was caught napping.         
	That encouraged speedster Dale Steyn to mock big: They probably didnt have a strategy They were bowled out for 76 and I guess that happens when you dont have a game plan         
	Few would disagree.         
	Team Indias fate in Motera, off Ahmedabad, was sealed before lunch on Day I itself, but few wouldve imagined a rout inside three days.         
	That too at the hands of South Africa, a team once regarded as very poor travellers to the subcontinent.         
	Up in heaven, Bob Woolmer (the first Protean coach to highlight the need to tackle spinners aggressively) must surely have smiled on Saturday evening.         
	Mickey Arthur deserves kudos, of course, but some of the credit for South Africas fantastic win has to go Woolmers way. The process of not getting psyched out in the subcontinent was, after all, initiated by him in the mid-Nineties.         
	As things stand, the South Africans cant lose the series (Future Cup being the trophy) and many would be tempted to bet on Graeme Smith being the victorious captain, just like the late Hansie Cronje, eight years ago.         
	Much was made of a solitary warm-up match for India before the recent Test series in Australia, but its worth noting that Smith and Co. decided against even one. They preferred, instead, to spend a few days at home after a physically demanding tour of Bangladesh.         
	Bottomline is that the South Africans had confidence, driven by plenty of self-belief.         
	Also, in the lead-up to the series, the visitors No.1 concern was mental conditioning coach Paddy Uptons presence in the Team India dressing room. They werent exactly that worried about the Anil Kumbles and the Sachin Tendulkars.         
	Again, the South Africans had the confidence to deal with the strictly on-field issues.         
	While captain Kumble and coach Gary Kirsten have plenty of work ahead of the third and final Test, in Kanpur from Friday, questions need to be fired at the Board of Control for Cricket in India.         
	For the past few months, its priority has been the Indian Premier League (IPL). That, to say the least, has been unfortunate.         
	Nobody will go on record, but the IPL has been a distraction  the headline-making February 20 auction in Mumbai, in fact, was held during the tri-series in Australia and in the middle of the Duleep final  and theres been a push for the IPL to upstage everything.         
	Those promoting the Chennai Super Kings, for example, need to be asked why they scheduled the formal launch during the first Test. Moreover, incredibly, Virender Sehwag was in Delhi for the unveiling of the DareDevils in the short break before Test No.2.         
	Why all this in the middle of a series with three back-to-back Tests?         
	Contrast the officially-sanctioned tamasha in India with the approach of the South Africans, many of whom will also feature in the IPL.         
	According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph, a member of the team management made the IPL-related ground rules very clear within a day of landing in India. Specifically, that he didnt want anything to do with the IPL being discussed even at the breakfast table.         
	Clearly, among the South Africans, theres been clarity over priorities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IFA Shield shift on cards
                                                IFA Shield shift on cards
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Some of the IFA Shield matches including the derby clash between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan may be held outside the city.         
	The change in plan may be necessitated by the fact that the main venue, the Salt Lake Stadium, will be unavailable from March 1 to 10 because of the Calcutta Book Fair.         
	According to an IFA official, the organisers are mulling the option of holding the East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match in Siliguri.         
	We are keeping all options open, he said.         
	The IFA Shield final is likely to be held on March 7.

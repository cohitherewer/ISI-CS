The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chopra slips
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chopra slips
                      
	Hilton Head Island (US): Daniel Chopra could not arrest the slide in his form and went three-over 74 to drop down to tied 60th after the penultimate round in the $5.5 million Verizon Heritage Golf tournament.         
	After rounds of 69 and 72, the Swede of Indian origin needed a strong third round to make his way up the leader-board. Instead, Chopra returned his worst card of the week so far and his three-day total of three-over 215 leaves him in an unflattering position in the leader-board. Once more, Chopra struggled to come to terms with the par-71 harbour town golf links and a couple of birdies were of hardly any consolation when he had five bogeys on the other side of his ledger.         
	Boo Weekley stayed on course for a successful title defence. A stroke off the pace overnight, the 34-year-old American charged three shots clear with a six-under-par 65.

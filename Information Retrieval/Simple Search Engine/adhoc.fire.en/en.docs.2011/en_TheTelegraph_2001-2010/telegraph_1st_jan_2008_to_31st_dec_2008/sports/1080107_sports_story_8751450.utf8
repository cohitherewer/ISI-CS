                                                   ICC: No letter from BCCI

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has not received any communication from the Indian Board till late on Sunday night regarding the umpiring in Sydney. 
    
	BCCI president Sharad Pawar told a news channel that they had conveyed their strong views to the ICC. But an ICC spokesman told The Telegraph: We havent received any official communication from the BCCI. 
    
	The BCCI has sought Steve Bucknors removal from officiating in the third Test. The West Indian is scheduled to stand with Pakistans Asad Rauf in Perth. 
    
	A source, however, said that the standard Test playing conditions do not permit such moves. Neither teams will have a right to object an umpires appointment, says the rule. 
    
	For the record, when Darrell Hair was banned after the Oval fiasco, the executive board passed the resolution via a two-third majority.

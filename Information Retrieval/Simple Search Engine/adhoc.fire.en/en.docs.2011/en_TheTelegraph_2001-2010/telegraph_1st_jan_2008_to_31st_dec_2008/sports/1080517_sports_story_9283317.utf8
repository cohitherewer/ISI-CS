The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time to look ahead, says Shah Rukh
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Time to look ahead, says Shah Rukh
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Mumbai: Going by the numbers on the shirts of thousands of fans, Fridays IPL contest here was between (Sachin) Tendulkars No.10 and (Shah Rukh) Khans No.12.         
	It turned out to be a no-contest with the Mumbai Indians thrashing the Kolkata Knight Riders before a packed and delirious Wankhede.         
	The massive defeat, though, didnt dishearten owner Shah Rukh.         
	A bad defeat, yes, but the way forward is to forget about today and look ahead to Sunday and the match against the Chennai Super Kings, Shah Rukh told The Telegraph.         
	As is customary for him, Shah Rukh went to the Mumbai Indians dressing room and congratulated the winners. In fact, he left the Wankhede after the teams.         
	Shah Rukh, by the way, said that there would be no party in the hours immediately after the match.         
	Not because we lost, but because John (Buchanan, coach) didnt want one tonight... As tomorrow (Saturday) is a day of travel, he made this request a couple of days ago. Thats why, for a change, we had a party on the eve of the match...         
	Incidentally, Shah Rukh may rush back to Mumbai after Sundays match at the Eden as he has plenty of non-IPL commitments to keep.         
	A handsome Knight Riders win could, however, hold him back.

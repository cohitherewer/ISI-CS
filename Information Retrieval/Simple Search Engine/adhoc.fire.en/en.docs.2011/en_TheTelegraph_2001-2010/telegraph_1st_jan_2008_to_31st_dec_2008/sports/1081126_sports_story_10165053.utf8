                                                                                                                                                                                                       Must get basics right, says Shah
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Owais Shah                           
	Cuttack: Englands Owais Shah on Tuesday lauded Yuvraj Singh for his two consecutive hundreds in the opening matches of the series and rued the lack of big scores from the batsmen of his country.         
	Yuvraj is on fire... He has got two hundreds in this series, we have none... Obviously that is where we fell short, Shah said while addressing the media at the team hotel in Bhubaneswar.         
	Theres little we could do against Yuvraj... Plans are plans We have to execute it. He is playing phenomenal cricket at the moment... Sometimes, you have to give credit to people when they are playing well.         
	The right-handed batsman, who played a scintillating knock of 72 (off 48 balls) in Bangalore, also stressed on the batsmens need to convert the starts into big ones.         
	We need to get our basics right and get a few hundreds at the top of the order. Obviously, the man who gets in has to go on and put a big score, taking charge of the innings, he said.         
	There are other areas in bowling and fielding where we have to improve. We have to get our yorkers in and slower ball right. Its very tough More tough here at this level. In the subcontinent, they have got their skills, yorkers, slower balls right.         
	Shah also said he felt that Monty Panesar should have been in the ODI squad.         
	He has the skill I dont know why he has been left out Ask the selectors. I am one of the players and I cant answer.         
	Shah also voiced his frustration regarding the Duckworth-Lewis method and said the ICC should look into this aspect.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yousuf blames it on PCB, BCCI
                                                   Yousuf blames it on PCB, BCCI
                                  Yousuf      
	Karachi: Pakistan batsman Mohammed Yousuf is disappointed at not being part of the Indian Premier League (IPL) players auction and holds the PCB and BCCI responsible for missing out on a lucrative deal.         
	I am disappointed I was not part of the bidding process but I was assured that the boards would take care of everything. So I left it to them to handle this issue.         
	I just want this matter to be settled quickly and get on with my life, Yousuf said.         
	Yousuf was prevented from taking part in the bidding process by a restraining order obtained by the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) from an arbitration panel headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court. The ICL claims Yousuf breached a contract with them.         
	Yousuf said the PCB and BCCI had assured him that there would be no problems in playing for the IPL. (PTI)

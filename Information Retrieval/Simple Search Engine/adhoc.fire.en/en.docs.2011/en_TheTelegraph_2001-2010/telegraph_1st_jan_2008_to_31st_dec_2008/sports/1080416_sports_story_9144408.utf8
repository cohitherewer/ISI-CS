The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dont think of giving up country for IPL: Bindra
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dont think of giving up country for IPL: Bindra
                  Bindra                     
	London: The ICCs principal adviser-designate I.S. Bindra has advised cricketers against giving up their central contracts to participate in the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL), saying the Twenty20 event will not accept any rebels.         
	Bindra, also a member of the IPL governing council, urged players to be patient and wait for the League to adjust itself to the international calendar.         
	That solution (players rejecting central contracts) is not acceptable to us, Bindra told a television channel.         
	We will not have any player revolting against their establishment and becoming part of the IPL, he added.         
	His comments came in the wake of England Cricket Board (ECB)s refusal to allow its players to participate in the next edition of the IPL, which triggered speculation that the cricketers might revolt against the move.         
	Apart from this, a players survey in Australia also revealed that easy money on offer in the IPL was too tempting for the cricketers to resist and they were willing to give up national duty for it.         
	However, Bindra said the IPL did not wish to be labelled a rebel tournament by allowing revolting players to participate.         
	Bindra said he would speak to ECB chairman Giles Clarke during the IPL inauguration in Bangalore to work out a window for English players.         
	We dont want to be a rebel league, we want to be part of the system with the support of the ECB. We are looking forward to meeting Giles Clarke and other members of the ECB during the inauguration in Bangalore, he said.         
	Bindra, however, hailed the possibility of an English version of the IPL and said such an event would only bolster the Champions Twenty20 League, scheduled in October. Bindra was enthused by the idea that the ECB would be meeting Texan billionaire Allen Stanford to explore the possibility of having its own version of the IPL.         
	 Its a good news and I think it would be great if all the countries start their own Twenty20 league, he said.

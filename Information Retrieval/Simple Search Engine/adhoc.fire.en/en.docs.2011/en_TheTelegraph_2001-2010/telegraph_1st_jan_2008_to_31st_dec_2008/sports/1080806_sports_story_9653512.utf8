   - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -   TEAM INDIAS BIG 3 ON the FORMER ENGLAND SKIPPER              LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Michael Vaughan                      
	Colombo: Michael Vaughans decision to relinquish Englands Test captaincy after losing the ongoing series to South Africa continues to be talked about. As also his superb record: 26 wins, 11 losses in 51 Tests.         
	On Tuesday evening, The Telegraph spoke to Indias Test captain Anil Kumble and two former captains  Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid  for their views.         
	While the captaincy was taken away from Sourav (Indias most successful in Tests) after a lengthy run of five-and-a-half years, successor Rahul chose to leave the hottest seat after being in it for around two years.                   Kumble            Ganguly            Dravid      
	The following are excerpts from what they said (in alphabetical order):         
	Whether Vaughans decision came as a surprise         
	DRAVID: Sitting thousands of miles away, its difficult to say anything... I dont know what was going on in his mind.         
	GANGULY: Yes, it did surprise... I cant understand why he left the captaincy with one Test in the series remaining... He could have waited for it to end but, then, thats a personal observation.         
	KUMBLE: I didnt expect him to step down (now)... Having said that, Im not aware of what he was going through.         
	Vaughan as captain         
	DRAVID: He was tactically good... I watched him from close during our tour of England last year... Also watched bits of his captaincy during the 2005 Ashes, which England won.         
	GANGULY: Very good, I mean his record proves it... However, in the 2005 Ashes for example, he had an excellent attack at his disposal... Had wicket-taking bowlers.         
	KUMBLE: He was good... As captain, he definitely had a presence on and off the field and helped England achieve the results they did during his tenure.         
	Whether captains have a shelf life         
	DRAVID: Dont know...         
	GANGULY: Yes, I think so... Probably five-six years... Its a personal thing, really... Depends on the individual.         
	KUMBLE: Difficult to say... Possibly...         
	Finally, thoughts on Kevin Pietersen, who has been given the Test and ODI captaincy         
	DRAVID: Hes Englands best batsman, but cant comment whether his batting will get affected... What I can say is that hell be as good as his team. Thats how it works.         
	GANGULY: Its to be seen whether his natural flair gets curbed... It will be interesting to see how he handles himself.         
	KUMBLE: Difficult to form an opinion on whether captaincy will affect his batting.

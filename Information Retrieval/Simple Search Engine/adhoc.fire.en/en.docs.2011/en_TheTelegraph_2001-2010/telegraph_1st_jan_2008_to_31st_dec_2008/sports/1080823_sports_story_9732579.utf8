	Beijing: Bolt powered his Jamaican team to a world record victory in the mens relay to seal his dominance of Beijing athletics. He ends the games with the relay win and emphatic triumphs in the 200m and 100m, all achieved in record times.         
	All I can say is yo, Jamaican sprinters (are) taking over the world, he said after his final race.         
	The 22-year-old struck back at criticism off his exuberant celebrations by Olympics chief Jacques Rogge who said he should show more respect to other athletes.         
	The crowd loves it, said Bolt. What I do I do for myself, my coach and the fans. Im just showing my personality.         
	The Jamaican women, who won the individual 100m and 200m races, missed the chance to give the Caribbean island a clean sweep of sprint golds when they fumbled the baton handover in their 4x100 relay, allowing the Russians in for victory.         
	Saturday is the last big day of medals, with 32 on offer, including the last diving gold, in the 10m platform, which Chinas Zhou Luxin is favoured to win to give the hosts a clean sweep of all eight diving medals.         
	American team leaders have called for a post mortem into their disappointing showing after they failed to win a sprint gold in an unboycotted Games for the first time since 1976.         
	Apart from Sundays mens marathon the Olympic athletics end on Saturday. The highlight will be Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekeles attempt to add the mens 5,000m to his 10,000m title, a double already achieved by female compatriot Tirunesh Dibaba.

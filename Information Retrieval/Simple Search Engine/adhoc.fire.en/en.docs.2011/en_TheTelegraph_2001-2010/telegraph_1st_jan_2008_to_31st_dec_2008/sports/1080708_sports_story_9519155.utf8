The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Havent seen anybody as gifted as Mendis: Akram
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Havent seen anybody as gifted as Mendis: Akram
  - Great tactical move did it for Sri Lankans, says former Pakistan captain       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Wasim Akram                                 
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has complimented the Sri Lankans for a great tactical move: Not playing mystery man Ajantha Mendis in the Super Four match against India.         
	We were all quite surprised that day (last Thursday), but the Lankans had a plan... In fact, not exposing him then was a great tactical move, Akram told The Telegraph.         
	As it turned out, Mendis reduced the Indians to a bunch of clueless batters in Sundays Asia Cup final. But for captain Mahela Jayawardene allowing the Indians some breathing space, by giving Mendis short spells, the 23-year-old wouldve finished with more impressive figures than six for 13.         
	The more the world sees of Mendis, the more the batters will be able to pick him but, for now, hes so special... I dont think Ive ever seen any bowler so gifted... Hes just amazing, Akram added.         
	A truly terrific compliment from, inarguably, the finest left-arm quick of all time.

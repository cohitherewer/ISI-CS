The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gary wont be around during the final Test
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gary wont be around during the final Test
  - Condition of Team India coach rsquo;s mother, who has cancer, worsens in Cape Town hospital
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Colombo: Gary Kirsten is steeling himself for the worst.         
	This is a (sad) chapter in my life, the Team India coach told The Telegraph, before leaving for home town Cape Town (via Dubai) where his mothers condition has taken a turn for the worse.         
	She (64-year-old Gayl Hall) has terminal cancer and is in hospital... Unfortunately, her general condition has worsened... Its something one has to face up to, Kirsten added, during a one-on-one at the Taj Samudra on Tuesday night.         
	For now, he wont be around only during the series-deciding third Test, in the Sri Lankan capital, from Friday.         
	I cant, at this moment, say anything more... If she doesnt come through, then... Lets see how things go, Kirsten said somewhat emotionally.         
	He tried leaving on Monday itself, but the flights were full.         
	As there already are two specialist coaches, Venkatesh Prasad (bowling) and Robin Singh (fielding), plus mental conditioning expert Paddy Upton, in the support staff, the Board isnt rushing anybody to stand-in for the overall coach.         
	Actually, such a step could have been counter-productive.         
	Kirsten is, of course, very confident that Anil Kumble and his men can win the series. I have no doubt about that... Indeed, I expect a big one from a Sachin (Tendulkar) or a Rahul (Dravid) or a (V.V.S.) Laxman... I do expect at least one of them to come really good.         
	He added: Weve just had a great win (second Test, in Galle, after being routed in the first) and that has lifted the teams confidence... It sure came at a nice time.         
	The Test series will be followed by five ODIs, the first being in Dambulla on August 18.

                                                   Yelena breaks own record
                      
	Donetsk (Ukraine): Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva broke the world indoor pole vault record by clearing 4.95 metres at the Sergei Bubka invitational meeting Saturday.         
	The Russian beat her own mark of 4.93 set in the same competition organised by the great Ukrainian pole vaulter in his home town a year ago. It was the third consecutive year in which she improved on the indoor record.         
	Isinbayeva twice failed to clear 4.94 before raising the bar one centimetre to set her 21st world record, indoor and outdoor. It has been 12 months to be exact, since I last broke the world record, the 25-year-old said.

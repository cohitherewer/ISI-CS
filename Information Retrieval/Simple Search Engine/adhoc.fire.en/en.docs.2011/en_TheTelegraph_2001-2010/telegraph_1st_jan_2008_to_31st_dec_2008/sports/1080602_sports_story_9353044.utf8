Francis Saldhana is an anaesthesiologist by profession, but he also owns a sports promotion company named FS Sports, said a source in the AIFF. He has also arranged for the team to play a tournament there  West Virginia Soccer International, 2008. Saldhana, who is presently in India to watch the Indian camp in Goa for the next one week, has agreed to bear the bulk of the expenses for the tour. India would be pitted against teams from West Virginia, Ohio and South Carolina in Schoenbaum Stadium (Ohio), Marshall University (West Virginia) and Morgantown (West Virginia) during their tour.         
	The Indian under-16 players are currently training under AIFF technical director Collin Toal.

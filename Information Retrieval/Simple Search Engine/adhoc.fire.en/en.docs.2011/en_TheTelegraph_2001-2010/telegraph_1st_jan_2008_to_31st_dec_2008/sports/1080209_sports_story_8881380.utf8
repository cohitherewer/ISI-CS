The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan bank on Barreto magic
                                                  Bagan bank on Barreto magic
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will look for three points to keep championship hopes alive when they face leaders Dempo in their Round XVI ONGC I-League encounter at Salt Lake Stadium Saturday.         
	A win for Dempo, on the other hand, will reinforce their title chances. Dempo have 31 points from 15 points while the city giants are placed third on the table with 27 points.         
	In absence of their in-form striker Bhaichung Bhutia (double bookings), coach Roberto Carlos Pereira will bank on Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto to lead the attack.         
	Admitting that Bhaichungs absence will be a big factor, Pereira said: We need to win this match to keep our chances alive for the title. But Bhaichungs absence could be a big blow to the team. We have no option but to remain positive and go all out, Carlos said after Fridays training session.         
	The boys are all charged up after the win over Salgaocar and they know the importance of a win tomorrow (Saturday). I expect them to deliver their best, he added. Pereira hinted at fielding P.C. Lalawmpuia.         
	The Brazilian coach appeared quite positive about Barretos role. We need him and I know he will take the lead. Barreto, who has not fully recovered from an ankle injury, went for a scan Friday afternoon. The reports were ok and the Barreto will surely play, a club official said.         
	I am feeling fine and by tomorrow morning I will be much better, Barreto, who had a light training session, said.         
	With Douglas da Silva and Venkatesh making a comeback, Bagan will have Rahul Kumar, N.S. Manju, Peter Odafe, and Habibur Rehman Mondal in the defence. James Singh and Dharamjit Singh will look after the mid-field.         
	Dempo are likely to miss the services of their Brazilian Beto who is suffering from diarrhoea.         
	In Mumbai, Mahindra United, placed fifth in the standings with 21 points, will hope to overcome Sporting Clube de Goa without too many problems.

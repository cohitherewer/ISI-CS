                                                                                                                                                                                           Ricky: A captain needs to know his players away from cricket
  -   Australias phenomenally successful captain unwinds 
        LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                      Ricky Ponting    
	Calcutta: Ricky Ponting isnt just one of the modern day greats where batting is concerned, he has been an incredibly successful Australian captain.         
	Indeed, his success percentage in Tests is an awesome 75.61 (31 wins, 4 losses in four years) and an equally amazing 75.45 in ODIs (126 wins, 31 losses in six years).         
	The other day, Ponting  one of the top guns in Shah Rukh Khans Kolkata Knight Riders  spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on captaincy.               
	The following are excerpts from the 45-minute one-on-one         
	Style of captaincy         
	Ive always tried to be pretty open with the team I realise that what I personally believe in may not always be the right way (forward) I share my thoughts with others in the dressing room and get others to share their thoughts too Ive never tried to distance myself from the other guys and captaincy hasnt changed the way I behave in the dressing room Captaincy brings with it more responsibilities, like giving the younger guys a bit of direction, but Ive tried to remain the same person.         
	Role model captain         
	I was fortunate to play under some very good captains for Tasmania David Boon, Jamie Cox Also, some very good captains when I began playing for Australia  Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh But its not that Ive only learnt from them Ive been part of some very good Australian teams and Ive sat back and listened to what teammates have had to say about the game and so on I wouldnt say theres been one person or captain that Ive wanted to be like My leadership style, I guess, has definitely been influenced by all the captains Ive played under.         
	On learning from Taylor and Steve         
	Id sit back and listen to both, listen to the voices of the group I think thats where one learns the most from Its not necessary that the captains are always right or wrong, its about listening to what the majority in the group feels. More than the actual captaincy, I probably learnt more about the style of cricket we needed to play Players of my generation learnt a lot playing under Taylor, to start with.         
	The man management factor         
	Id say captaincy is more off the field The tactical side of leading on the field gets fine-tuned in the lead-up to matches Nowadays, the preparation indeed is heavier The other side of captaincy is getting to know the players away from cricket and thats where man management comes in If you dont know your players away from cricket, then it can become very hard to communicate If you cant communicate, then you cant get the best out of them. Ive been captain for over six years (starting with the ODIs) and Ive tried hard to understand the personality of every player Once I know the players personality, then I know how to talk to him Once I do that in the right way then, hopefully, Ill be able to get the best out of him.         
	Whether he reads the Riot Act at the end of a rare bad day         
	Now and again its pretty healthy for the team to be told exactly what Im thinking about the way were playing our cricket and the way were going about things. Dont think thats happened too often, though, probably three or four times. One such day was after the first tri-series final, at the SCC, early last month. I was pretty unhappy about the way wed played and I let that be known Sometimes, you do need to give an individual a kick up his backside When you do that, you also need others to know why that was done So, you need to nurture them a bit more Give them, in particular, more positive advice. Im sure such things happen in most sporting teams The captain or the coach lets off steam When a few hard truths are told.         
	Being saddled even with personal problems of his players         
	I have to deal with that on most days It could be anything Cricketers, today, need to juggle around their time and make sure that they give the game whats required.         
	The pressure of leading a team thats always expected to win         
	Dont think theres more pressure because of the rankings One of the strengths of our team, over the years, has been that weve never thought of the rankings Being No.1 or whatever (Adds laughing) Were reminded of it all the time, though, more so when were in India Credit to our players that we always find ways and means to get better as a team Its not about being happy with where we are, but constantly challenging ourselves to get better         
	Whether hes ever felt the heat of being the captain and the teams premier batsman         
	This (Australian) summer, yes But more because of all the stuff that was going on off the field I wasnt a part of all that, but still had to answer all the questions at press conferences It was tough, because of the scrutiny But, then, youre put in a position because people believe youre good enough to handle its demands That youre the right person Thankfully, all that is behind us and were ready for fresh challenges.         
	Failed Ashes campaign in 2005         
	Then, I was under more pressure on the field We didnt play the brand of cricket that was needed to win and, so, lost.         
	Coping with setbacks         
	I try and not think about things too much Generally, regardless of what happens, I stay quite level headed Lets say I stay neutral Try and forget about the issues and try and refresh my mind Thats important.         
	Whether captains have a shelf life         
	Dont think so I dont see why captains need to be any different from batters and bowlers who can go on playing for an X number of years Of course, you need to give time to yourself Once in a while, you need to get away from cricket.         
	Having different captains for Tests and ODIs         
	We handled it very well, when Steve was the one-day captain and Taylor led in Test cricket Also, when I got the captaincy in ODIs and Steve continued to lead in Tests But I really dont know whether thats the ideal situation Much, I suppose, depends on the maturity of the individuals         
	Most enjoyable moments as captain         
	When we won back the Ashes last season and the two World Cups won under my captaincy, in 2003 and 2007 We played unbelievable cricket right through the 2006-07 Ashes As for the World Cups, we went through both undefeated Any captain and any team would be proud of such an achievement We worked hard and got the rewards         
	Whether captaincy has taught a few things         
	(Grins) Youre learning and growing every day If youre not, then youre wasting your time My approach has been to go out there and try and make myself better every day One does make mistakes, both as a batsman and as a captain, but one has to learn from them Im a pretty simple type of a person and like to keep things simple.         
	Idea of a good captain         
	Look, you could see a captain having a chat with his bowler and there could be a wicket in that over That could look as a great piece of captaincy, but you never get to know what that chat had been all about I mean, that wicket could have come in a totally different way from what had been planned! Its tough enough making judgements on players, tougher to judge captains But, yes, good captains need to have good skills of communication and they should be able to lead from the front If youre talking about the players and the team having to behave in a particular way, then youve got to show the way yourself. I havent got it right every single day, but one learns What I can say is that Ive tried to set high standards.         
	A contemporary captain whom he has admired         
	I liked Stephen Fleming He made New Zealand into a pretty competitive team The bottomline is that a captain is only as good as his players If, for example, your bowlers dont bowl in the right areas then you could actually end up looking quite a silly captain.         
	On Anil Kumble and Mahendra Singh Dhoni as captains         
	I havent analysed their captaincy, but both have done a good job I find Dhonis comfortable with the captaincy and handles the media well Anil surely has to be given credit for the Indians being so competitive in the recent Test series.         
	Whether the profile of a coach matters         
	The captain and the coach need to have a great relationship Having said that, the captain of a cricket team becomes a coach too on the field Hes the one who makes the moves Adapts to situations So, in that way, theres a lot more responsibility on the shoulders of a cricket captain A coach, I think, must clearly understand what certain guys need and what certain guys dont need The training has to be such that the players peak at the right time That the intensity remains high (After a pause) My relationship with John (Buchanan) was very, very good (Successor) Tim Nielsens appointment has been terrific Tim does a few things little differently from John, but thats to be expected There was continuity when Steve succeeded Taylor and when I succeeded Steve, but there was a difference too.         
	Finally, his message for rookie captains         
	Spend time with your teammates off the field Perhaps, show some compassion In every sport and team therell be a group that will naturally get along better with some other group Its important to recognise them not as groups but as part of a team If such an environment is missing, then it will be hard to get the best out of the players

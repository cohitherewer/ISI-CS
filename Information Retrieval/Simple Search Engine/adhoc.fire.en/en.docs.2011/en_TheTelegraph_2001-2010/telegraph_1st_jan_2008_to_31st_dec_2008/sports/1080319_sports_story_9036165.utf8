The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Charl pulls out of India tour over policy row 
                                                     Charl pulls out of India tour over policy row 
          
	Durban: South Africa fast bowler Charl Langeveldt withdrew on Tuesday from the tour of India after his selection had caused controversy.         
	Langeveldt, who is black, was included in the squad earlier this month ahead of the white Andre Nel in accordance with Cricket South Africas (CSA) racial transformation policy.         
	Charl Langeveldt called me today (Tuesday) in an emotional state saying he wanted to withdraw from the tour so he can consider his international future in the right frame of mind, CSA chief executive Gerald Majola said in a news release.         
	He said the public controversy over the selection of the team to tour India had upset him to the extent he would not be in the right frame of mind to tour India and do his best.         
	Nel had reacted angrily to his omission and threatened to quit international cricket as the issue made big headlines in the local media.         
	Majola said he tried to convince Langeveldt of his worth to South African cricket.         
	I have assured Charl he is very much in the Proteass plans and is regarded as one of our best fast bowlers in one-day International and Test cricket, said Majola.         
	We will have in-depth discussions with him and hopefully he will continue to be available for international selection.         
	Majola, meanwhile, feels that with the worlds top ODI batsman Graeme Smith leading them, the South Africans are all set to thump India.         
	Cricket South Africa (CSA) salutes Graeme on remarkable achievements at such a young age. Graemes leadership qualities have really come to the fore, and CSA is confident that he will take the Proteas to the number 1 spot in Tests as well, Majola said in a statement.         
	India beware in the forthcoming three match Test series which starts in Chennai next week. Smith and his boys are going to thump Anil Kumble and his charges, he added.

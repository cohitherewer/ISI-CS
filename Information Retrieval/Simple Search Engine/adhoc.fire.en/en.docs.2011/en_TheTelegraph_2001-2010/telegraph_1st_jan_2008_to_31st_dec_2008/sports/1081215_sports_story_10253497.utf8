The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saha pulls Bengal out of distress
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Saha pulls Bengal out of distress
                  Wriddhiman Saha                     
	Nagpur: Riding on Wriddhiman Sahas strokeful 159, Bengal reached 371 for six wickets, 32 runs adrift of Vidarbhas first innings score of 403 at the end of Day III of the Ranji Trophy Plate group B match at the Vidarbha Cricket Association ground on Sunday.         
	Struggling at an overnight score of 149 for four, Bengal owed their position of strength to a highly responsible knock from Wriddhiman (264 balls,19x4), who combined with Dibyendu Chakraborty (56) to stitch a 120-runs fifth wicket partnership.         
	After Dibyendu left, Wriddhiman along with Avik Chowdhury (42 ..) put on a sixth wicket stand of 102 before edging out an outgoing Srikanth Wagh delivery at the stroke of tea.         
	Ritam Kundu (34 not out) shared an unbeaten 42-run crucial seventh wicket stand with Dibyendu, before stumps were drawn for the day.         
	Vidarbha pacer Umesh Yadav (3-84), who bowled at a lively pace, often troubled the visitors batsman on a fairly docile pitch.           (PTI)

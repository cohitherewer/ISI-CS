	Symonds rsquo; view
 Andrew Symonds has labelled Harbhajan rsquo;s taunt as ldquo;unacceptable rdquo; and vowed not to cop remarks from rival players with whom he has no friendship. Symonds broke his silence to declare he could tolerate racism mdash; but only from those he knew.
 ldquo;I rsquo;m not a sensitive person about it, rdquo; he said. ldquo;If you know me well you can have a joke to me about anything and any part of racism and I rsquo;ll laugh, he was quoted as saying in The Daily Telegraph. ldquo;I mean, I rsquo;m not sensitive about it but if I rsquo;m not your friend, if you rsquo;re an opposition player or something like that, it is unacceptable.
 
	 Clarke wants Anil rsquo;s number
 Australia Test batsman Michael Clarke wants India captain Anil Kumble rsquo;s number to clear the air ahead of the Perth Test. While Clarke was seen by some as the matchwinner critics questioned his seemingly unsportsmanlike demeanour. ldquo;I have tried to get Anil Kumble rsquo;s mobile phone number so I can call him and smooth things over, rdquo; Clarke was quoted as saying in The Sydney Morning Herald.
 
	 Indians still 
 love me: Lee
 Australia fast bowler Brett Lee denied there rsquo;s any bad blood between the Indian and Australian players and is certain his hard-won positive image in India. ldquo;Definitely not, rdquo; he said. ldquo;The respect I have for their players and the love I have for their country means that it rsquo;s definitely not going to have an impact on us going over there and touring, whether it rsquo;s to play cricket or to do work with sponsors or whatever, rdquo; Lee was quoted as saying in The Age.

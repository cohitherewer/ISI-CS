                                                   Greg picks Souravs boy! 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Almost a year (March 17 actually) after India took the first step towards crashing out of the last World Cup, the then coach, Greg Chappell, did a talent hunting in the city on Saturday.         
	Since that debacle in the West Indies, much water has flown down the Bhagirathi over the citys bitter relations with the Australian over Sourav Gangulys life outside the Team India fold, but he couldnt escape the public anger even during the latest visit.         
	Some die-hard Sourav fans showed the former India coach placards and pestered him with go back Chappell slogans before he left the city.         
	In an ironic twist to all this, however, Chappell chose one of the pupils from Videocon School of Cricket, an academy owned by Sourav.         
	You will be coming to Jaipur for the final selection, Chappell, now associated with the Rajasthan Cricket Academy as advisor, told Adil Imam, after a five-minute look at the wicketkeepers batting at the Ashok Malhotra Cricket Academy.         
	The 18-year old from Patna will be joined by Suvaaankoor Das, another wicketkeeper batsman from Rourkela and leg-spinner Manas Muduli of Orissa in the final selection process. A total of 24 aspirants will be picked by Chappell of whom one will get a chance to play for Rajasthan Royals, the Jaipur-based IPL side.         
	In the city, 487 players from Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh were registered for the trial in the city leg.         
	The selected trio have been asked to attend the 10-day final camp scheduled to start at the Rajasthan Cricket Academy from March 21 till 31.         
	Asked about his opinion on the local talent, Chappell tersely said, Im happy.         
	Chappells method of selection, however, drew a mixed reaction from the young hopefuls. The 22-year-old Amarjeet Singh, who came to the city from Nainital, had no clue how the Australian had dismissed him only after a two-minute look at his knocking. Mein toh kabhi socha nahi tha ki aisee bhi kisi ka talent spot ho sakta hai Is it a joke or what, he said.         
	Kunal Patel, who came from Dhanbad, almost broke into tears when the bio-mechanist Ian Frazer, who was looking after the bowlers, told him to try his luck next time.         
	Some youngsters, however, returned happy, having received valuable tips from the former Australian captain.

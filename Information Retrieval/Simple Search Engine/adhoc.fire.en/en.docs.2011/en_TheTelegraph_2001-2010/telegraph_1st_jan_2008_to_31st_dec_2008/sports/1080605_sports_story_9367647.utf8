The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sohail named replacement
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sohail named replacement
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan selectors on Wednesday replaced beleaguered pacer Mohammed Asif with young fast bowler Sohail Khan in the squad for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh starting Sunday.         
	A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said owing to the delay in Asifs release from detention in Dubai for allegedly possessing contraband drugs, the selectors consulted the board, captain Shoaib Malik and coach Geoff Lawson before deciding to call up Sohail for the tri-series also featuring India and Bangladesh.         
	We really dont know when the Asif issue would be resolved and he doesnt even have a visa for Bangladesh. Because of these logistical issues it has been decided to replace him with Sohail, one official said.         
	The tri-series starts from June 8 with the Pakistan squad leaving on Friday. (PTI)

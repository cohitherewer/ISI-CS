	Barcelona: For England and Fabio Capello this was an unpleasant formality. Beating the foul-happy Andorrans and their brutal brand of anti-football is a pretty thankless task. And for 49 minutes England struggled to do that, locked into grim goallessness.         
	It was the half-time introduction of Joe Cole that got England out of that hole, as he scored twice to make the best of what was looking an increasingly bad job. And so the national side continue to stumble and blunder.         
	Capello, in excluding Michael Owen, had insisted only players in peak condition would be in his team. Joe Coles exclusion from the starting XI could only then be explained by the slight calf strain.         
	But if so, it must have been very slight indeed because he played without impediment on his belated arrival. There is no question now: he must start against Croatia in Zagreb on Wednesday.         
	The English supports initial good humour rapidly soured and the barren half-time scoreline was met with jeers.Capello reacted at half time by removing the timid Downing and the ineffective Defoe. On came Emile Heskey and Joe Cole.         
	He sent his players out early and afterwards explained it was due to an overheating dressing room. Much of the heat seemed to be emanating from the animated Italian.         
	The effect of the changes was almost immediate, Joe Cole scoring just four minutes after the resumption.         
	Fernando Silva, the Andorra striker, went piling through Glen Johnson and was booked.         
	Lampards free kick was cushioned by Joleon Lescott into Joe Coles path and he connected crisply with his volley back across the goalkeeper.         
	Six minutes later he had his second. Gareth Barry saw Rooney in space in the D. Rooney detected Joe Coles run and played a disguised pass into his path, Cole getting to it just before Koldo and poking into the net England were full of confidence now, even John Terry venturing a shot that hit the side-netting. Johnson kept finding space and when one of his angled shots did go in, it was ruled offside because Joe Cole had been judged to have interfered with play when he tried to flick the shot in. You couldnt fault him for going for the hattrick.           THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

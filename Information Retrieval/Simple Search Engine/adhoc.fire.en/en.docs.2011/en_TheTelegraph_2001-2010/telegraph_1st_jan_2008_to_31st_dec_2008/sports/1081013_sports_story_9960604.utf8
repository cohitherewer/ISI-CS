The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Riveting final day on cards
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Riveting final day on cards

	Bangalore: The final day at the Chinnaswamy will not be for the faint hearted. Given the shifting moods and rhythms already witnessed in this opening Test, it will be a true test of ones mind and body.         
	The penultimate day provided a glimpse into what might follow. Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma triggered an Australian collapse, but it was not enough to prevent the visitors from taking a 263-run lead at the close.         
	Australia pushed and prodded on a seemingly deteriorating surface until the unbroken sixth wicket pair of Shane Watson and Brad Haddin added 65 to give some respectability to the total.         
	The onus lies with Ricky Ponting. Knowing well that the lead is already much more than any team has made batting last here, he will need to give his bowlers enough time to dismiss India. With Stuart Clark nursing an injured elbow, the timing of declaration could turn out to be very crucial.         
	The highest achieved in the fourth innings here is 239, which India made four years ago during their 217-run loss to Australia.         
	Weve a strong batting line-up and were not worried about the target I cant see why we cant chase a target if we have enough time in our hands, fielding coach Robin Singh said.         
	It was a grim struggle for Australia against some accurate and incisive bowling. Runs were difficult to come by which meant the 70-run first innings lead was going to be vital.         
	Matthew Haydens run of poor scores continued on this tour. After a third-ball duck in the first innings, he managed just 13 before falling leg before to a Zaheer Khan inswinger.         
	The opener, who had an average of 61 on his previous two tours to India, is still struggling to find his touch following the long lay-off for an Achilles tendon injury.         
	For Simon Katich, it was a struggle all the way. He batted for 189 minutes for his 34, his first boundary coming after facing 97 deliveries.         
	His agony finally ended when V.V.S. Laxman took an easy catch at silly point after a Harbhajan delivery jumped and spun from the rough.         
	The quick dismissals of Ponting and Michael Hussey somewhat dented the visitors hopes. The Australian captain played straight into the hands of Laxman at short mid wicket while Hussey was perplexed by one from Harbhajan that hit a crack and turned in. In between, Michael Clarke became Ishants second victim.         
	Hussey (33), like in the first innings, was again shaping up as the mainstay in the middle-order when Harbhajan struck. It put the innings in disarray until Watson and Haddin did the rescue act with a determined effort.         
	With Anil Kumble missing most of the action due to a sore shoulder, it was left to Harbhajan at one end and the pacers from the other to shoulder the responsibility. Zaheer, who is having an outstanding Test, started the rot but it was Ishant (2/76) who looked more menacing.         
	An aggressive approach, a high-arm action, a well-positioned wrist, all combined with a mighty heart to breach the oppositions defences contributed to Ishants success.         
	No wonder the Aussies are sorely missing a quality spinner in this Test. Ponting will have to contend with the fact that he doesnt have a Shane Warne or Stuart MacGill in his armoury on a crumbling fourth innings wicket.         
	To lose Warne, Glenn McGrath, Adam Gilchrist, Justin Langer and Damien Martyn in the past couple of years would have been far too much for anyone else. But Australia have the reserve strength to meet any eventuality born out of their exit.         
	It is, however, in tours as tough as India that limitations in experience get exposed. Pontings men faced one such situation on Sunday morning as the Indian tail frustrated them for 86 minutes. There was very little the captain could do except wait patiently for the batsmen to commit a mistake.         
	After Harbhajan had shown the way on the third afternoon, Zaheer kept the momentum going. His unbeaten 57 was his second half century and partnerships of 31 with Kumble and 27 with Ishant meant India went past the 350 mark.         
	The last three pairs added 128 to the total.         
	Australias distress ended when Shane Watson jagged one back to trap Kumble in front and Michael Clarke bowled Ishant a little before lunch.

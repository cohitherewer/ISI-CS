The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangwan delighted
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sangwan delighted
                      
	Vadodara: If Ishant Sharma started the rot, it was Pradeep Sangwan who forced Rest of India into the rut and the left-arm Delhi pacer says nothing really matched the feeling of picking up the wicket of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the Irani Trophy tie here on Wednesday.         
	It was akin to banging the head against the wall in the morning session as Sangwan steamed in and sent down delivery after delivery only to see an unresponsive pitch and well-set Wasim Jaffer and Rahul Dravid thwart his plots.         
	Post-tea, things finally changed and in the 64th over, a casual Dhoni played a shot away from his body to guide a Sangwan delivery to Aakash Chopra in the slips. Of course Dhonis was the biggest wicket for me.         
	After all he is a star player, said the pacer, who was part of Indias under-19 World Cup winning team.         
	Though he had to bowl against the likes of Dravid and V.V.S Laxman, Sangwan was far from overawed. We took it easy and like any other game. We were not bowling to reputations, but to players. This approach helped. he said.         
	With Delhi already gaining an upper hand in the tie, Sangwan said its time to tighten the screws.         
	We always knew we are a strong team. We have 4-5 Test players in the ranks. Besides, you have all the frontline Delhi players playing together, probably for the first time, he said.         
	Delhi coach Vijay Dahiya also had no reasons to complain after his bowlers shot out their opponents for 252.         
	I think we made a comeback in the second session, giving only 60-65 runs and claiming three wickets. That changed the match, Dahiya said.         
	Though the track had no life in it, Dahiya said his pacers did a brilliant job. (PTI)

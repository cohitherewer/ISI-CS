      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary was not happy after the selectors included him among the three standbys for the tri-series in Australia. 
    
	I am not at all happy, a dejected Tiwary said. I was hopeful of making the squad. I got runs and played quite well so far this season. Even I am fit and there is no problem with my shoulder, Tiwary said. 
    
	But its all luck I feel I am going through a bad phase, he added. 
    
	While in the NCA camp, I was hopeful of my selection. Even Dav Whatmore praised my batting, he said. I was out from the Bangladesh squad after injuring my shoulder But when I am fit and performing well I dont know why they left me out, Tiwary rued.

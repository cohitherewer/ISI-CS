                  Ashok Dinda celebrates the fall of a New Zealand wicket in Chennai on Monday                     
	Chennai: India A fought back to restrict New Zealand A to 230 in their first innings and snatch a slender 18-run lead on the second day of their four-day match on Monday.         
	Replying to Indias 248, New Zealand were bowled out for 230 in 83.1 overs. India, in their second essay, were 27 losing opener Shikar Dhawan, when bad light stopped play with 3.3 overs remaining to be bowled. Sahil Kukreja and M. Vijay were at the crease.         
	Powered by half-centuries from Aaron Redmond and Jamesh Marshall, New Zealand were cruising at one stage at 3/179. But Indian bowlers triggered a batting collapse in the post-lunch session as the visitors slumped to 9/202.         
	Spinner Mohnish Parmar was the most successful bowler. Ashok Dinda produced an inspiring spell, scalping vital wickets of Marshall and Nathan McCullum, while Sudeep Tyagi and Amit Mishra took two wickets each.         
	Indias lead would have been higher, but the New Zealand tail offered some resistance with the last pair of Michael Mason and Trent Boult adding 28 valuable runs in 11.1 overs.

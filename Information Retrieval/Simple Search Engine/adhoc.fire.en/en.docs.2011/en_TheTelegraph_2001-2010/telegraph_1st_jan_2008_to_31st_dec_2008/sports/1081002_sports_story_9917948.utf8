	New Delhi: Sourav Gangulys inclusion in Indias Test squad for the first two Tests against Australia on Wednesday evoked mixed reactions from former cricketers and selectors. While some described it as a step backwards others hailed the decision.         
	The following are excerpts from former chief selectors Syed Kirmani and Kiran Mores reactions:         
	SYED KIRMANI: He (Sourav) deserved this selection. It was expected, you cannot ignore such an experienced player. Sourav is a source of inspiration to the youngsters. He still has a lot of cricket left in him.         
	KIRAN MORE: I am really surprised by the decision. He was not in the Rest of India team for the Irani Trophy or the Board Presidents XI. There is no long term planning. We are going backwards. This is almost the same team that lost in Sri Lanka. Something is wrong somewhere. When will players like Badrinath play Tests? I dont think Badri will get a chance to play in the series. I cant blame them (the selectors) much. They are new.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Turkey are dangerous, says Loew
                                                                                                                                                                                           Turkey are dangerous, says Loew
                      
	Tenero: Turkey have relied on some very German qualities to get into the semi-finals of the European Championship, and now they will have the chance to test them against the three-time champions when the two teams meet for a spot in the final.         
	Turkey coach Fatih Terim will need some ingenuity just to put a healthy team on the field because his squad is decimated by injuries and suspensions. Up to nine regular first-choice players could be out, depending on some late fitness checks. In such circumstances, the hopes for an upset look very slim.         
	Germany coach Joachim Loew has a full-strength squad to choose from for Wednesdays match in Basel after midfielder Torsten Frings recovered sufficiently from a broken rib. But Loew has coached in Turkey and has warned his players about the passion in Turkeys game.         
	Germany captain Michael Ballack expects a very strong Turkish team despite the depleted teams injuries and suspensions.         
	Germany have won 11 matches against Turkey, drawn three and lost three. But the Germans have lost two of the last three games and drawn the other. After staging three amazing comebacks to reach the semi-finals, even an injury-ravaged Turkey will be confident heading into the game, Loew said.         
	All teams in the semi-finals have a certain class. I know Turkish players and the conditions there from my own experience, Loew said after the teams training session in Basel.         
	They become euphoric, especially if things are going their way. They have national pride, very high morale and they play until the end, the very last minute. It will be very hard. Ill warn my players that Turks believe until the end that they can win the game.         
	Turkey equalised against Croatia with the last kick of the quarter final game. Having gone behind in the 119th minute, Turkey still went on to win the penalty shootout.         
	They never give up, Loew said. They always believe they can turn it around. Some people did not expect them to come back but they have incredible morale.         
	Loew said Turkey, in a way, were a more difficult team than highly-fancied Portugal, who Germany beat 3-2 in the quarterfinals. The Portuguese were easier to figure out. The Turks are more creative and dont stick to their positions so much, Loew said.

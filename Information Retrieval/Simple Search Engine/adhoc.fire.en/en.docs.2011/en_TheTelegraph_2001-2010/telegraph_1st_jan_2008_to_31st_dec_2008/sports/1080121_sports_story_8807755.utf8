	Morgan urges Aussies to tour Pak
 Melbourne: ICC president-elect David Morgan urged Australia on Sunday to go ahead with their March-April tour of Pakistan, saying the world champions would be safe in the troubled nation despite the ongoing political turmoil.
 Morgan said it would be ldquo;rather sad rdquo; if Australia pulled out of the tour. Concerns are mounting on whether the tour would go ahead ever since Pakistan plunged into chaos after former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto rsquo;s assassination last year.
 
	 PCB denial
 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has rubbished claims that it had made maverick fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar a scapegoat for the recent series loss to India by dropping him from the ODI squad to play against Zimbabwe. Shoaib was left out of the one-day series against visiting Zimbabwe starting on Monday and also faces the prospect of losing his central contract worth Rs 3 million a year.
 
	 Pak move
 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is considering offering a general amnesty to ldquo;rebel rdquo; cricketers, who have aligned with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), sources said. A PCB official said that chairman Nasim Ashraf wanted to give the ldquo;rebel rdquo; players a final chance to leave the ICL by offering them an amnesty.
 
	 Indian angle
 Durban: Jonathan Vandiar, a promising young cricketer of Indian origin, has been picked to represent South Africa in the under-19 ICC World Cup in Malaysia next month.

 The 18-year-old batsman from the working class suburb of Chatsworth in Durban, is among the 15-member squad announced on Sunday. The young Vandiar scored a century against India in the first of two friendly matches played in Chatsworth early this month.
 
	 Mahela praise
 Colombo: Sri Lankan cricket captain Mahela Jayawardene has hailed India rsquo;s historic victory in Perth against Australia and said he looked forward to facing the rejuvenated neighbours in the tri-series starting on February 3. ldquo;It is an excellent win for India, rdquo; he said, adding the game was played in a good atmosphere after the unsavoury incidents in Sydney. ldquo;After the setbacks in Sydney, the (Perth) game was played on a much better note and we are happy that we will be there in this atmosphere. rdquo;

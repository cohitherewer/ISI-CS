	Mumbai: United SC put up a superlative display in the second half to outclass Durand Cup champions Mahindra United 3-1 in the I-League match at the Cooperage ground here on Saturday.         
	After conceding an early goal, scored by Sushil Kumar Singh off a header, United SC came back strongly in the second half and pumped in two goals within the first eight minutes of play to lead 2-1 against the 2005-06 national league winners.         
	United SC, who were promoted this year, equalised through their foreign signing Subair Murithala Ali within the first minute after crossing over and then went ahead seven minutes later through their ebullient striker Gauranga Dutta.         
	The Calcutta team then held their rivals at bay with some outstanding midfield play in which Snehasish Chakraborty and substitute Hardeep Singh caught the eye. It was Hardeep who sealed the local giants fate with a superb strike three minutes from time. United, who lost their opener against East Bengal 1-3, opened their points tally while Mahindra remain without a point to their credit following their second straight defeat in the league.         
	The Mumbai giants had lost 1-2 to Churchill Brothers of Goa in their opening I-League clash.         
	After playing second fiddle for the better part of the opening half, United totally dominated the second with their speedy thrusts from the flanks and emerged deserving victors. It was Mahindra who went ahead in the 13th minute when Sushil Kumar Singh nodded home from close range a measured cross from the right from Steven Dias.         
	Had Mahindras Nigerian striker Chidi Edeh not fluffed a goalmouth cross from Sukhbir Singh two minutes later, things could have panned out differently for the home team.         
	The introduction of Hardeep for an ineffective R. Dhanarajan in midfield in the 32nd minute galvanised the visiting teams forward line.         
	The change of ends saw a totally different picture with United running the local team ragged and it was a quicksilver move on the right flank that caught Mahindras defence napping in the opening minute after resumption of play.         
	Gauranga Dutta outpaced the defensive line to pass the ball to Ali who simply lofted the ball over an advancing Mahindra custodian Subashish Chowdhury to bring United level with the local team.         
	It was Duttas speed and opportunism that got them their second goal in the 53rd minute. He came charging in to connect with a centre from the left by Chakraborty and headed the ball in.         
	After losing a good chance to draw level when Diass free-kick hit the post ten minutes later, Mahindra became desperate for a goal but then fell further behind.         
	Ali bamboozled the defence on the left side of the box and sent in a cross which was driven home with an angular shot from Hardeep, the ball going in after ricocheting off the post.         
	Mahindra coach Derrick Pereira blamed his midfield for the stunning reverse against United.         
	Our midfield did not play well. We lost the match because we left lot of gaps in the midfield. We need to combine as a team, Pereira said after the match.         
	Victorious United SC coach Subrata Bhattacharjee hailed his teams fighting spirit against a top team like Mahindra.         
	Im very happy to win the match. We really fought hard to win it, he said. (PTI)

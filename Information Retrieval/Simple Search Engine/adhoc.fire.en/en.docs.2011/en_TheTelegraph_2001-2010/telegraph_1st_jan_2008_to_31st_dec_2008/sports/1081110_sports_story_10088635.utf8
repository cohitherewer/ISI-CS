            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa believes that its sheer hard work that is paying dividends.         
	 I feel its hard work that helped us earn full points Yeah theres a bit of luck but boys worked hard too, Karim told reporters after Sundays win against Churchill Brothers.         
	According to the Moroccan, there was no secret behind Bagans good performance since the Dempo match last week.         
	In football there cant be any secret. We were very much organised today. We had a good defence, good midfield and a good attack also That sums up our day, he added.         
	Bagan coach however, praised Churchill Brothers for their positive football. You cannot take away the credit from them. They were really good. But we actually cut their supply line and that left them far behind today, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Churchill Brothers Serbian coach Zoran Djordjevic rued poor refereeing for the loss.

                    Serve Volley      Naresh Kumar                                        Leander Paes with Cara Black after winning   the mixed doubles title          
	A Grand Slam title is every top players dream. For most of them in India, before Leander Paes came, participation and a good performance satiated their hopes. In 1999 at Wimbledon, Paes won two titles; the mens doubles and the mixed doubles.         
	For me it was the emotional high of my tennis life - unbelievable and traumatic. It put Indian tennis on the world map with a bang.         
	Last Friday after winning the mixed doubles with Cara Black, Paes at 35 years of age stood on the threshold of yet another double triumph in the 2008 US Open.         
	Late into the night as we watched with nerves on edge, Paes and his partner Lukas Dloughy were narrowly beaten in a magnificent match, in two tiebreaker sets 7-6, 7-6 in the mens doubles final.         
	One double fault at set point in the second set, was the lone blemish in an otherwise brilliant performance by Paes.         
	The bouncing Bryans were nervy in the closing stages of the second set and Paes and Dloughy who were steadily improving could well have triumphed in the third and final set.         
	It was sad that Paes failed to win two titles, but one must rejoice at his mixed doubles success.         
	The television commentators hailed Paes as one of the greatest ever doubles players and even labelled his play as exotic. The Bryan brothers called him a legend. The pivot of Paess game is his unpredictability.         
	His frequent interceptions at the net seem to have a psychic premonition, which dominate and frustrate his opponents. Keeping one eye on the ball, and the other on Paes hovering on top of the net for a kill is unsettling and can break any ones concentration.         
	Paes has improved his service, especially the second serve, and his forehand return. Now, in his twilight years the irrepressible Paes has his sights on the 2012 Olympics! Dont laugh.         
	 I laughed when he told me that he would win Junior Wimbledon. In the past I have often seen Paes take his game beyond his limits at moments of crisis.         
	It seems he has an in built turbocharger of adrenaline. His continuing success at 35 years of age when others have hung up their boots is based on his fitness regimen, which he has been following with fanatic devotion for many, many years now.         
	His positive attitude is also a major factor in his success. In the years that I was the non-playing captain it fired up the whole team.         
	Can you imagine that with his treasure of experience and positive aggressive vibes, whatever his other shortcomings may be, Paes will be sitting on the bench and not in the Davis Cup captains chair?         
	His exit orchestrated by two ageing youngsters refusal to play under him is a shame. With rankings close to the 250 mark and still struggling after years to make a breakthrough they have to be reminded of their credentials.         
	The AITA is not to be blamed for succumbing to this blackmail, as there are no other players in India who can put on some sort of a show. Indian tennis desperately needs to develop youngsters with talent and promise.

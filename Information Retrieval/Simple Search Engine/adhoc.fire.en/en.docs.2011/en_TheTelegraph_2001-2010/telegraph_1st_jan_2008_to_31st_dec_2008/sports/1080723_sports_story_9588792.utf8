The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahela bats for referral system
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mahela bats for referral system
  - Sri Lanka captain speaks highly of Mendis       A CORRESPONDENT            Mahela Jayawardene                                 
	Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene on Tuesday said the starting XI hasnt been finalised but he wants spin sensation Ajantha Mendis to go out on the field and enjoy himself, if selected.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the hype surrounding Ajantha Mendis         
	We cant control the hype that has been built up. For us, obviously, we will stick to our game plan. Its good to have him. But we still havent finalised our eleven because of the conditions, since it has been overcast. But its good for him if he makes his debut as well. A great opportunity for the young guy who has come from humble beginnings. It is a luxury for him to have Murali and Vaasi around him because they are going to take the bulk of the responsibility.         
	The teams expectations from Mendis         
	What we want him to do is go out and enjoy himself. There are a lot of expectations of him from a lot of other people but from the teams point of view, there is hardly any expectation. We know cricketers have good days and bad days, we just want everyone to go out and enjoy their cricket. That will apply to Ajantha as well if he plays on Wednesday.         
	On the introduction of the referral system         
	Yes, I am all up for it. It is a very good system. What we are trying to eradicate is obvious mistakes that happen on the field. I think the umpires are in favour of that as well. Its going to be used for the first time so I am not sure how good it will be but we need to support this because it will benefit cricket overall. We have to do it in a very respectful manner for the umpires as well because after all, they are humans as well and they understand that sometimes they do make mistakes. I think it will benefit cricket in the long run.                     
	On the controversy over managers appointment for the series         
	It is beyond our control. We are just working hard at the nets and keeping our focus on the Test match tomorrow. I honestly dont know what is going on. Trevor (Bayliss) is the one who has been having these chats with the Board in that regard.         
	The wicket         
	The last few times it has been quite flat but we need to take the initiative on this track in the first few days. Thats where the Test match will be won or lost. So it is important that the first couple of days, we start strong. But SSC has been a very good Test wicket. There is something for the fast bowlers, it is a very good batting track and the spinners will come into play as well.         
	On Chamara Silva missing out         
	Prasanna (Jayawardene), when he got injured, Chamara (Silva) came and played that game but when Prasanna comes back, Chamara will step out. It is unfortunate for someone but at the same time, Dilshan got runs in the last Test match and he has been scoring runs in one-day cricket. He wasnt given an opportunity in the three-day game because he was our top choice. You cant really swap and change just because some guys get runs in one game. We have lot of confidence in the group of players that we have got.         
	On the challenge of facing India         
	They are a very strong team. They have got quality batsmen, their record speaks for itself. They have four or five of the most experienced players in the world in their lineup and they have got some really good bowlers to back that up as well. It is going to be a really good challenge for us. It is great exposure for some of our younger guys who have come up through the system. So definitely, we look forward to the challenge.         
	The injury problems in the Lankan team         
	Thats something I cant control. The other guys who have been given an opportunity have done well for us. We didnt have Lasith (Mailinga) and Dilhara (Fernando) and (Fervez) Maharoof for the last six months consistently but others have performed well even in the West Indies. So am not worried about it. The others have grabbed their opportunity every time because they know such opportunities dont come often.         
	On the advantage of playing at home         
	There is a lot of pride involved in it. We dont want anyone else to come and beat us at home. Thats the attitude we go with. The fans are here to support us, this is our home ground and we would like to protect that. Thats why we are very consistent at home .         
	The pressure of playing at home         
	No extra pressure. We have grown up with it. If you cant do well at home, that will be an issue because we have grown up in these conditions and the guys are thriving on that pressure.

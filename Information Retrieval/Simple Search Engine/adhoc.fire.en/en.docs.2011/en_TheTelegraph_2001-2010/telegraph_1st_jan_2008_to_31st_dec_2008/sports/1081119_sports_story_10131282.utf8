The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif was caught with opium, says Naghmi   Mohammed Asif
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Asif was caught with opium, says Naghmi   Mohammed Asif
                    Mohammed Asif                      
	Islamabad: A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official confirmed that Mohammed Asif was in possession of opium when he was detained in Dubai earlier this year and the inquiry committee has recommended the fast bowler be banned and fined.         
	It was proved during our investigation that Asif was caught with a small amount of opium at the Dubai airport, Shafqat Naghmi, the PCBs former chief operating officer and member of the inquiry committee, said on Tuesday.         
	In June, on his way home from playing in the Indian Premier League Twenty20 ournament, Asif was detained for 19 days in Dubai after authorities allegedly found opium in his wallet at the airport.         
	The 25-year-old fast bowler was accused of carrying 0.01 ounces (0.25 grams) of opium, but he tested negative for drugs and was released without being charged. But he was questioned by Dubai authorities for drug possession and smuggling while he remained in custody at the airports detention center. He was actually deported from Dubai as the amount of opium was not enough to lay down charges, Naghmi said.         
	The PCB later formed a three-member inquiry committee  headed by Naghmi  and suspended Asif from playing international and national cricket after it emerged the pacer had tested positive for the banned substance nandrolone in the IPL in May.         
	Asif has filed an appeal with the IPL drug tribunal in Mumbai and his next hearing will be held on November 29.         
	We have completed the draft of the report, but the new PCB officials have not so far asked us to submit it, Naghmi said.         
	Asif reacted angrily to Naghmis remarks. I dont think this committee has the authority to say such things now. It is the present set-up (headed by Ejaz Butt) which is responsible for everything now, he said.         
	Asif said he had told the committee that he had been taking some herbal medicine for his elbow problem when he was detained in Dubai.         
	I think this is nothing but a publicity stunt to get attention since these officials are no longer in the cricket board. I will talk to the board chairman, he said.         
	Earlier this month, Naghmi was replaced by former Test fast bowler Salim Altaf on the PCB while Butt took over as the new chairman, replacing Nasim Ashraf.         
	The new chairman didnt talk to me after his appointment, but even now if the PCB just sends me a letter to submit our findings on Asifs case, I will do so, Naghmi said.         
	The former PCB official said that the other two members of the committee  former PCB director of human resources Nadeem Akram and present director of cricket operations (International) Zakir Khan  have recommended a ban of several international matches and financial penalty on Asif.         
	I have already drafted the report in which we have also taken into account the statement of Asif that he recorded before all three of us, Naghmi said. The draft is with me and I just have to sign it and send it to the PCB.         
	Naghmi said the investigation found that Asif had violated a number of PCBs rules on players code of conduct.         
	I cant reveal exactly what we have recommended, but I can say that Asif breached a number of rules and regulations for which we suggested a ban of several international matches and also financial penalty, he said.

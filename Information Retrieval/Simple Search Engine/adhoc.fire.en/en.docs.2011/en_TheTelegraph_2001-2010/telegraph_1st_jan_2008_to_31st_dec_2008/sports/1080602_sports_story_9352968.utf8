    - Super Kings go down fighting in last-ball FINISH                 Rajasthan Royals Yusuf Pathan in action against Chennai Super Kings during the IPL final at D.Y. Patil Sports Stadium in Mumbai on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Rajasthan Royals used their bowling resources intelligently to restrict Chennai Super Kings to a modest 163 for five wickets in the final of the Indian Premier League at the D.Y. Patil Stadium on Sunday.               
	Rajasthan Royals clinched a last-ball thriller to emerge champions in the inaugural edition of the IPL. They needed eight runs off the last over and captain Shane Warne, along with Sohail Tanvir, kept his cool to pull off a three-wicket victory in the end. Yusuf Pathan, who took three wickets and was the top scorer with 56, was the Man of the Match.               
	Royals skipper Shane Warne won the toss, asked the rival team to bat first and then captained the side imaginatively with his field placing and bowling changes, never allowing the Super Kings to settle down on a slow-pace track.         
	The Super Kings owed their score mainly to an enterprising 43 by in-form batsman Suresh Raina, who faced only 30 balls while hitting two pulled sixes and a four.         
	The UP left-hander, back in the Indian one-day team, built on a decent start of 39 in 5.2 overs provided by Parthiv Patel (38 in 33 balls) and Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan (16 in 14 balls).         
	But his dismissal in the 17th over when he threatened to cut loose derailed Chennais plans for a more healthy total.         
	The most impressive bowler for the Royals was off-spinner Yusuf Pathan, who grabbed three for 22 in two spells while Shane Watson accounted for the wicket of Raina.         
	The Super Kings, who had lost their two home and away ties earlier in the tournament to the same opposition, began their innings on a cautious note on a slow-paced track of low bounce on which the ball did not come on freely to the bat.         
	Parthiv and Sivaramakrishnan played it safe against Sohail Tanvir, who had grabbed six for 14 against them on May 4 at Jaipur.         
	Seeing the mood of the two openers, Warne removed the Pakistani left-arm pacer, the most successful bowler in the tournament, after only one over.         
	The run-rate perked up when Vidyut played an inside-out cover drive off Watson and then was lucky when his top-edge flew over the third man fence for a six.         
	Parthiv, coming into the match on the back of an unbeaten 51 last night in the semi-final against Punjab Kings XI, was content to see off Tanvir by facing five dot balls and then hitting his first four. He was also lucky to see his top edge off Munaf Patel race to the fence.         
	Warne replaced Watson with Pathan after five overs, in which 39 runs were scored, and the move paid off immediately when Vidyut pulled a short ball for Ravindra Jadeja to bring off a fine front-diving catch at mid-on.         
	Warne rung in quick bowling changes to unsettle the second-wicket duo of Parthiv and fellow left-hander Raina, who had powered their team to a nine-wicket win over Punjab Kings XI with an unbeaten century stand.         
	The 50 of the innings was raised in the seventh over and then Parthiv, after pulling off-spinner Pathan for his fifth four, departed. He edged an attempted off-glide to wicket keeper Kamran Akmal who juggled with the ball before completing the catch.         
	In-form Raina, who made 54 not out against Deccan Chargers in his teams last preliminary phase tie and followed it up with 55 not out against Punjab, continued his good run by stroking the ball well. He was hardly troubled by the spinners and pulled the great Warne for a six.         
	Albie Morkel (16) also pulled Warne disdainfully for a six into the stands in the 12th over after the first 10 had yielded 75 runs. The South African all-rounder also swung Pathan over mid-wicket for his second six before he got out in the same over, 13th of the innings.         
	In trying to repeat the shot he ballooned a catch to stumper Akmal who took a tumble over Mohammed Kaif, who also went for the ball, while managing to hold on to the sphere to provide Pathan his third wicket.         
	The 100 came up in 80 balls after which Raina swung Sidharth Trivedi, bowling his second spell, for a six. Later skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (29 not out in 17 balls) lofted Warne, bowling his last over, over the straight field for another six to take Chennai Super Kings to 117 for three with five overs remaining.         
	Raina fell in trying to clear the long off area and was caught just inside the rope by Jadeja after which Dhoni and Chamara Kapugedara added 20 runs before the latter holed out in the deep off Tanvir in the last over.         
	Dhoni, who hit a straight second six in Tanvirs last over, and S Badrinath (6) remained unbeaten at the end of the innings.

	Beijing: A minor sprain in the neck may have hampered S.S.P. Chowrasias build-up for the Volvo China Open but the Indian Masters champion is still confident of giving his best at the $2.2 million event at the Beijing CBD International Golf Club this week.         
	Chowrasia sprained his neck during a gym session but asserted that it wont affect his chances of making an impression at the event co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour, European Tour and China Golf Association.         
	I was working out and accidentally went overboard with the weights. I was initially afraid that it may affect my driving swings but it was not as bad as I thought, he said.         
	Theres still a little discomfort but Im sure it will be okay when the tournament gets underway on Thursday.         
	Chowrasia is part of a large Indian contingent which includes Gaurav Ghei, Shiv Kapur, Rahil Gangjee, Amandeep Johl, Digvijay Singh and Gaganjeet Bhullar.           (PTI)

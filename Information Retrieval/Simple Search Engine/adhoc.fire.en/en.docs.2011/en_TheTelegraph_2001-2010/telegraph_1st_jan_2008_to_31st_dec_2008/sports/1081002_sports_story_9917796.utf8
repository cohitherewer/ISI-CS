            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Conquering Love fully justified his current form, and also his 12-10 odds, on his way to an easy victory in the 1,200m Roubaix Cup, the main attraction in Wednesdays seven-event card. Jockey C. Alford, who partnered the Conquering Hero-Mistrals Love son to victory, had the Darius Byramjis trainee settled up-front, with a marginal lead till the final turn but kicked clear of the opposition in the last 250m of the race.          
	Sieze The Night, also trained by Darius, scored a decisive victory in the 1,400m Accuser Handicap. D.K. Ashish rode a well-judged race on the winner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SA up 2-0
                                                                                                                                                                                                     SA up 2-0
                      
	Benoni: Hashim Amla scored a maiden one-day International century as South Africas batsmen feasted on the Bangladesh bowling to set-up a crushing 128-run win over the visitors in the second ODI on Sunday to move 2-0 up.         
	The true difference in class was on display, as the home side racked up 358 for 4, and after a brief assault early in the chase Bangladesh concentrated purely on batting out time, with Dale Steyn and Johan Botha again the pick of the attack.         
	Opening batsman Amla struck an elegant 140 off 134 balls as South Africa slammed 358 for four, their highest total in a one-day game against Bangladesh.

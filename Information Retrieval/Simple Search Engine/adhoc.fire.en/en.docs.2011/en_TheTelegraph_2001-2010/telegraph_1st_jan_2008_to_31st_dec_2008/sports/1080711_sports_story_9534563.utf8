	Sri Lanka contract dispute ends  Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket resolved its protracted contract dispute with players on Thursday after an emergency executive board meeting. A deal was thrashed out between chairman Arjuna Ranatunga rsquo;s interim committee and the Sri Lanka Cricketers rsquo; Association (SLCA), ending four months of negotiations. ldquo;Everything was resolved peacefully in a cordial atmosphere, rdquo; SLCA rsquo;s chief negotiator Graeme Labrooy told reporters.  
	ICC panel  New Delhi: The International Cricket Council has formed a top-level committee to resolve the long-pending issue of lsquo;unauthorised cricket rsquo; like the Indian Cricket League. ldquo;The ICC committee will discuss a whole range of issues including various legal aspects, rdquo; an ICC spokesman said.

	TV deal off  Colombo: The controversial multi-million dollar deal signed with Ten Sports for telecast rights of the cricket matches in the island country by the previous Sri Lanka Cricket interim committee has been scrapped by the government. ldquo;I have instructed SLC to cancel the television contract last evening after receiving the finding of a special three-member committee, rdquo; Sri Lankan sports minister Gamini Lokuge said.

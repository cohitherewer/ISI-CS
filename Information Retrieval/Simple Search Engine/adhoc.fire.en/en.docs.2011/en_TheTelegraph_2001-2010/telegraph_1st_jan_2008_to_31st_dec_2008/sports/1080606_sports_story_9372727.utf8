  - FINAL TEST vs NZ

	Nottingham: Kevin Pietersens 12th Test century helped England recover from a slump to reach 273 for seven on the first day of the third and final Test against New Zealand on Thursday.         
	Pietersen scored 115 for his first Test hundred at Trent Bridge, where he played for four seasons from 2001. He added 161 with wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose, who made 67, for the sixth wicket to revive England after they slumped from 84 for two to 86 for five in the space of 13 balls.         
	England need only to avoid defeat to claim a series victory.         
	Pietersen, 27, in his 39th Test, reached his century after tea with a firm drive through cover for four off Chris Martin. He celebrated animatedly by jumping in the air and pumping his fist and was warmly applauded by his former home crowd.         
	Englands afternoon slump began when Andrew Strauss fell six balls after lunch when he abandoned the patient approach he had employed in the morning by chasing a wide Kyle Mills ball to give Ross Taylor a head high catch at first slip for 37.         
	Ian Bell left without scoring after being trapped leg before wicket by Brien after only facing four balls.         
	The dismissal continues Bells poor run of form in England this summer.         
	Collingwood also went scoreless, being caught by Taylor in the slips off the bowling of Mills. He has only scored 32 runs in this series.         
	Pietersens confidence grew and his range of stroke-play became more expansive the longer he was in. An off-driven four, a pulled boundary and a flick through mid-on for another boundary, all off paceman Martin, demonstrated this in consecutive overs shortly before tea.         
	He eventually perished when Brien rushed him with the third over of the new ball as his half-hearted push gave New Zealand wicketkeeper Gareth Hopkins his first catch on debut.

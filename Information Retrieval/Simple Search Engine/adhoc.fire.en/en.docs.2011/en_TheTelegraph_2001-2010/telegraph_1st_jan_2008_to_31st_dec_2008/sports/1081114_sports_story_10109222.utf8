The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni is positive ahead of opener
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dhoni is positive ahead of opener
                  Harbhajan Singh in Rajkot on Thursday                     
	Rajkot: Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni reckons switching from Test to one-day cricket mode in just three days time would be the major challenge when the hosts take on England in the first of the seven ODIs here Friday.         
	Its never easy when you play back-to-back international series. We had three days time to switch over from five-day to one-day series. Its quite tough but then as an international cricketer you are supposed to play and adapt, said the wicket keeper-batsman ahead of the first of seven ODIs here.         
	Dhoni, however, expects a smooth transition because half of the players in the ODI squad did not play in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.         
	One of the good things is that half the side hasnt played the Test series. Its good right now. But I have played Test cricket as well as one-day series, it is quite difficult to switch over to one-day mode but as I said we are international cricketers. We are professionals, he said.         
	Looking ahead, Dhoni said even if India didnt take an early lead in the series, the hosts should remain optimistic.         
	If we lose a few games, we shouldnt be feel so low. We will win some and lose some but we will always have to have a positive frame of mind, he said.         
	The Indian skipper felt that the wicket looked on the softer side and could help the seam bowlers in the morning.         
	The wicket is quite soft right now. They are rolling the wicket, at the same time theres a bit of grass on it. So in the morning there will be assistance for fast bowlers. It doesnt look like it will break. Its all predictions, you will know only when you play, he said.         
	Dhoni felt the new Power Play, introduced from October 1, could throw up interesting possibilities.                     
	They have made it interesting. The last Power Play, the five overs, will be decided by the team which is batting. You (fielding side) wont have any liberty of planning. It means when you plan a few strategies on the ground, suddenly you find the opposition asking about the five overs. You have to be ready for it.         
	Its very tough to say anything right now, how much it will help the side batting first or second. We can see a few games and see what is really happening. But they say chasing will be easier if you have a good partnership and you can take it after that. It is really confusing right now, he said.         
	As per the new Power Play rules, the batting side can choose the timing of either the second or third Power Play (each lasting five overs), whereas the fielding side previously chose both.         
	Dhoni once again reposed his faith in out-of-form players like Yuvraj Singh who has lost his vice-captaincy to Virender Sehwag and felt that it was just a question of a few good innings before he regains confidence.         
	As a captain you have to give confidence to the players according to the talent. Sometimes when a player is out of form, he gets a lot of negative thoughts. Its important we should motivate him and realise his potential.         
	Its about one or two innings before the confidence is back. Its not that there is panic in the dressing room. We know about each batsmans talent. Once he gets into groove, he can contribute to the side, Dhoni said.                 (PTI)

	Belgrade: The English sides completed a clean sweep in the group stage of the Champions League as Chelsea, who finished runners-up in group A, joined holders Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool on Tuesday in the knockout stage, which starts in February.         
	AS Roma joined Chelsea in the last 16 as the group A winners, after classy second-half goals from Matteo Brighi and Francesco Totti secured a 2-0 home win over Girondins Bordeaux. Brighi scored from close range after a good run and cross by Simone Perrotta. Totti drilled in the second with the outside of his foot from a superb through from Jeremy Menez.         
	Greek side Panathinaikos secured the last available berth in the knockout stage after Giorgos Karagounis scored to give them a 1-0 win over Cypriot rivals Anorthosis Famagusta in a tense affair.         
	Karagounis picked up a loose ball after a defensive blunder on the edge of the penalty box and his shot somehow trickled under goalkeeper Zoltan Nagy and over the line.         
	The result also lifted Panathinaikos to the top of Group B above former winners Inter Milan, who face potentially difficult oppositions in the last 16 after a 1-2 defeat at Werder Bremen.         
	Now we deserve one of the strongest teams, Inter coach Jose Mourinho said. Manchester United, the champions, or Barcelona, currently the best in Europe, to really judge our potential in the Champions League.         
	It was a vital win for Bremen, who leapfrogged Anorthosis to book a consolation berth in the Uefa Cup last 32 available to the eight third-placed teams.                 
	Five-time winners Liverpool won group D after coming from behind to beat PSV Eindhoven 3-1 and finish ahead of Atletico Madrid, who were held to a 0-0 draw at Olympique Marseille.         
	Ryan Babbel, Albert Riera and David NGog struck for Liverpool after Danko Lazovic had given the home side brief hope of reaching the Uefa Cup knockout stage.         
	I am really pleased finishing top of the group but also to see how a lot of young players performed on this stage, said Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez.         
	Barcelona, who had already won Group C, were beaten 2-3 at home by Shakhtar Donetsk after fielding an under-strength side. Sporting Lisbon, who had also qualified, enjoyed a 1-0 success at Swiss side Basel.

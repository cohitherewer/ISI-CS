The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal heads for history at Federers expense
                                                                                                                                                                                                Nadal heads for history at Federers expense
    - French Open Mens and womens game in Stark Contrast                                     Rafael Nadal    
	Paris: Rafael Nadals ruthless pursuit of an historic fourth straight French Open title is likely to deliver another, possibly fatal stroke to Roger Federers lingering dream of an elusive Roland Garros crown.         
	The Spaniard brags a perfect record of three titles and 21 wins in 21 matches since his debut in Paris in 2005 and another victory on June 8 would take him alongside Bjorn Borg (1978-1981) as the only man to win four titles in a row.         
	The left-handed Spaniard has beaten Federer in the last two French Open finals as the world No.1s hopes of becoming just the sixth man to win all four Grand Slam titles have come up heartbreakingly short.         
	The 21-year-old Nadal has also won eight of the duos nine meetings on clay court including the Monte Carlo and Hamburg Masters tournaments this season and since April 2005, Nadal has racked up 108 wins in 110 clay court games.         
	But 2008 has seen the Swiss, who has 12 Grand Slams to his name, endure one of his worst years on the tour with just one trophy to show for five months of frustrating graft.         
	There is also another worry in the colourful shape of Serbias Novak Djokovic, who took his Australian Open title and showed off his clay court credentials with victory at the Rome Masters.         
	Little wonder that the popular Federer is hoping that Nadal, who suffered blisters in Rome and needed treatment for a leg injury in Hamburg, might suffer a physical collapse.         
	He is perhaps struggling a bit more due to the stress with the levels of the last few weeks. I am completely fine and I will be ready for the French Open, said the world No.1 after seeing his nemesis relieve him of his Hamburg championship in a defeat which ended a 41-match winning streak on the German soil.         
	Nadal, however, has shrugged off any fears over his fitness. I was a little bit tired, explained the world No.2 whose battling style saw him come back from 5-1 down in the first set in Hamburg after also winning a three-set and a three-hour semi-final match over Djokovic, the previous day.         
	But later everything changed. Its important to beat the No.1 and the best this year (Djokovic). With this result, Im already in the Masters Cup. I continue to be the No.2, but closer to the number on, the Spaniard said.         
	Beaten by Nadal in the semi-finals in 2007 and quarter finals in 2006, the Serbian world No.3, who celebrates his 21st birthday on Thursday, is the most successful player on tour this year.         
	He won his first Grand slam honour in Melbourne, dropping just one set in seven rounds and also clinched the Indian Wells Masters before his win in Rome.         
	I am getting closer to Nadal on clay, said Djovokic after losing 7-5, 2-6, 6-2 to the Spaniard in Hamburg. The semi-final was one of the best matches I have played, probably the best match I have ever played on clay. I am really pleased with my form ahead of the French Open, my fitness is good, I feel fresh and that bodes well for Roland Garros, the Serbian said.         
	Djokovic is also closing in on Nadals world No.2 position and the Spaniard believes that its just a matter of time before the Serbian is on top of the world.         
	He has improved incredibly and is getting better, said Rafael. Hes going to be world No.1 within a few years.         
	Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are head and shoulders above the rest of the mens field; world No.4 Nikolay Davydenko is almost 2000 points adrift of the Serbian in the world rankings.         
	As a result, the top three are certain to dominate the court time and column inches, but there wont be a dry eye in the house when former triple champion Gustavo Kuerten plays and, probably, loses in the first round.         
	The Brazilian, champion in 1997, 2000 and 2001, has featured in just nine tournaments in the last three years after failing to recover from a crippling hip injury.         
	This years emotional farewell would be the 31-year-olds last appearance of his 13-year career.           (AFP)

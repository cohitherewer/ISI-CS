The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumble uncertain for second Test
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kumble uncertain for second Test
            SUDIPTO GANGULY                      
	Mohali: Indias preparation for the second Test has taken a beating with the uncertainty surrounding the fitness of captain Anil Kumble, who is suffering from a shoulder injury incurred during the opening Test of the series in Bangalore. A decision on the availability of the veteran leg-spinner will be taken on Friday morning, before the start of the second Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.         
	Australia, though, cannot afford to be complacent as they also had their share of bad luck. The Australian pace attack, rendered inexperienced after the retirement of Glenn McGrath, will miss the services of Stuart Clark. Clark has been ruled out due to an elbow injury. Uncapped fast bowler Peter Siddle will take Clarks place in the XI.         
	The Indian team, however, are yet to make up their mind on the combination of the side in case Kumble fails to make it. In Kumbles case, it is not as simple as replacing a bowler with another. There is also the added responsibility of captaining the side.         
	In all probability, the baton might be handed over to Team India ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. India, in all probability, will play Munaf Patel in case Kumble is declared unfit. Harbhajan Singh will play as the only spinner in that case, with the support of the part-time off-spinner in Virender Sehwag.         
	The Mohali pitch has attracted a lot of attention with frequent rain hampering the preparation of the 22 yards. Thursday morning and afternoon also witnessed some rain with both India and Australia sweating it out indoors. Both captains admitted that the pitch will have something for the fast bowlers for the first couple of days, though it does not look to have too much grass on it.         
	The batsmen, too, will be thankful after the Bangalore experience, where playing through the line was almost impossible due to the slow and two-paced nature of the pitch. The ball will come on to the bat on this wicket and the crowd, for sure, will be treated to some flowing drives.         
	It will be, however, interesting to see what the captains opt for after winning the toss. On one hand, there will be invitation for them to field first and take advantage of the considerable amount of moisture. On the other hand, some hard sunshine in the morning may dry out the surface and make the pitch a batting paradise.         
	With Clarks injury, Australia will rely heavily on their pace spearhead Brett Lee, who has brought in a number of variations to his bowling. Lee is no longer only about pace but is striving to become a complete package on the sub-continental wickets with a clever mix of pace, slower deliveries and reverse swing. Thus, a lot will depend on how the Indian batsmen handle the Australian speedster.         
	Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who, according to many, played a significant role in both innings for India to save the Bangalore match, looks determined to go out with a bang. The lines on his face have hardened and Sourav looks a very determined cricketer at the fag end of his illustrious career.         
	The southpaw came back in the afternoon with R.P. Singh and coach Gary Kirsten to have a knock, after missing out on some batting practice due to wet conditions in the morning. Sourav also spent some time with Daljit Singh, the curator.         
	The battle for capturing that slight mental edge has also started, with Ricky Ponting openly blaming the Indians on Thursday of starting the war of words. The Indian captain refrained from adding fuel to fire and asked everybody to bring the focus back on cricket.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S Laxman, Sourav Ganguly, M.S. Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble/Munaf Patel, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma.         
	Australia (likely): Matthew Hayden, Simon Katich, Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Michael Hussey, Shane Watson, Brad Haddin, Cameron White, Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle.         
	Umpires: Rudi Koertzen and Asad Rauf         
	Match starts: 9.30am

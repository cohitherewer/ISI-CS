	Canberra: The tri-series was on Tuesday thrown wide open as a spirited Sri Lanka recorded their first win in the tournament  an emphatic eight-wicket victory over India in a rain-truncated match.         
	Put into bat, India rattled up 195 for five in their allotted 29 overs after play began late owing to rain but the islanders overhauled a revised target of 154 in 21 overs with 12 balls to spare at the Manuka Oval.         
	The Sri Lankans took full advantage of batting second as they chased the revised target without much fuss, riding on contributions from Tillekeratne Dilshan (62 not out) and Sanath Jayasuriya (27 off 13 balls).         
	Young Rohit Sharma gave ample display of his class with an unbeaten 70 while Gautam Gambhir (35), Sachin Tendulkar (32) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (31) came up with useful contributions.         
	All their efforts went in vain as another rain interruption immediately after the Indian innings made the equation under the Duckworth-Lewis method easier for the Lankans.         
	With this win, Sri Lanka took their tally to six from three matches.         
	India continued to maintain their position at the top of the table with eight points from four matches while Australia have seven from three matches.         
	The action will now shift to Perth where Sri Lanka will take on Australia in a day-night encounter on Friday.         
	Jayasuriya provided a flying start to Sri Lanka as he blasted 27 off 13 balls with two fours and two sixes. The left-hander looked in devastating form and scored 23 in one over from Sreesanth before being dismissed by Ishant Sharma.         
	Harbhajan then took Sangakkaras wicket (10) but that hardly affected the Lankan run-rate.         
	Earlier, the Indians did enough to post a healthy 195 from their 29 overs with Rohit providing the maximum thrust.         
	The Indians made a very slow start in the morning and scored their first run only off the last ball of the second over before Sachin Tendulkar (32) settled into the groove to coax 45 for the first wicket with Virender Sehwag (14).         
	Tendulkar started by hitting Chaminda Vaas over extra cover and went on to play some fine strokes, including a swept four off Vaas from outside the off-stump.

            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: The Shroffs and Singhs have decided to wait while the Doctors, Davids and Khans are out to make a killing as the curtain for the monsoon season goes up on Friday. The afternoons six-event card provides them with ample opportunities to do so.          
	If Pesi Shroffs inner circle is to be believed, the Mumbai-trainer is coming here in a big way  with 50 horses  and his presence alone in RCTC may give a different dimension to the city racing. Vijay Singhs absence in the opening days card is, therefore, looks a planned strategy. He loves changes, though Pesis lots may not arrive before the next month.          
	The afternoon card may be poor but with three-cornered bettings in most of the days events, the overall returns on the totalisator and odds offered in the bookmakers ring may ensure profit.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

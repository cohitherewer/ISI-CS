            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Cheteshwar Pujara had hoped to tap Rahul Dravids vast reservoir of cricketing knowledge when they met during the course of the Ranji Trophy quarter finals at the Brabourne Stadium.         
	But it was a very short tete-e-tete as Indias premier batsman walked past the Saurashtra dressing room at the end of the match. The former India captain condensed his years of wisdom into one line for the Saurashtra youngster. Keep doing what you are doing. You are doing well, Dravid said.         
	Perhaps, Dravid didnt feel the need to elaborate. In Pujaras own words, the innings at Brabourne on the final day was a bit different from the way he has batted this season.         
	My 189 against Punjab came off 182 balls and the 176 against Mumbai off 173. But Monday, my task was to stay at the crease for 90 overs, Pujara told The Telegraph.         
	Pujara rated his unbeaten 148 against Delhi at the Roshanara Club last year  when he batted the entire final day  as his best knock so far.         
	That hundred came in a difficult situation. It was a match-saving century, the (against Karnataka) was a match-winning one, he said.         
	Pujaras prolific run-making has, however, over-shadowed his teammate  promising all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja. Along with Pujara, Jadeja has been the key to Saurashtras emergence as a force in domestic circuit.         
	Jadeja rates the hundred he scored against Delhi earlier this season as his favourite knock. I made 143 and it came against a better attack. There was a lot of talk when I went in to bat, so it was very satisfying to make that century, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crisis in defence for United
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Crisis in defence for United

	Fears that Rio Ferdinand may have been struck by the dreaded curse of the metatarsal were allayed by Manchester United officials on Monday night as a defensive crisis threatened to ruin the clubs season. Despite the encouraging medical bulletin, Ferdinand seems certain to join fellow centre-half Nemanja Vidic on the sidelines when Roma head to Old Trafford on Wednesday and is already rated doubtful when the Premier League pacesetters host third-placed Arsenal this Sunday.         
	A collective sigh of relief would have greeted the scans that revealed Ferdinand had not suffered a broken bone in his left foot, which was placed in a protective plastic casing after he hobbled out of Uniteds 2-2 draw at Middlesbrough on Sunday, but the club have been unable to place a timescale on the England defenders return to action.         
	Rio went for a scan and we can confirm that he has not suffered any break, said a brief club statement.         
	Despite the emergence of Gerard Pique, the loss of Ferdinand would represent a serious blow to Uniteds quest for honours because Vidic is already sidelined for at least two weeks and their partnership at the heart of the defence has played a major part in Uniteds assault on the Premier League and Champions League.         
	However, Pique, 21, impressed after replacing Ferdinand at the Riverside and Ferguson already appears happy to turn to the Catalan should his senior colleague be ruled out against Roma with United out to protect a 2-0 first-leg advantage.         
	Pique came on and did brilliantly [against Middlesbrough], Ferguson said. He was marvellous. The lads a terrific player and I think that actually helped us. Weve got great confidence in the lad and hes come through very well.         
	Fellow defender Wes Brown remains confident United have the resources to cope with injuries as the season approaches a nerve-jangling climax on European and domestic fronts.                     
	Him [Vidic] and Rio have been outstanding  we have players to fill in, weve got John Shea, Pique, myself and Gary Neville as well, Brown said. All in all, as a group we can cope with it, even though its disappointing to lose players.         
	I think we believe we can go all the way. Other seasons weve got there but maybe not believed in ourselves  this time we all believe we can go all the way. We know weve got the squad and the players to do that. We went eight games without conceding a goal. Thats great for us. If we can keep it tight, we have a great chance.         
	United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar played down the notion Vidics absence contributed to the dropping of points on Teesside. Vida has been a very important player for us but Wes did a good job, the Dutchman said. I think its just a coincidence that its come with Vidas absence. Now we have to focus on Wednesday and the game on Sunday.         
	We said a while ago it was going to be very tight. Its still a three-horse race. Arsenal will come on Sunday now thinking they can beat us. Chelsea dont have an easy run either and its not guaranteed theyll win all their games until the end of the season.         
	United may not be able to look forward to another visit to Wembley this season but their captain, Ryan Giggs, believes a series of cup finals await the club as the race for the title hots up.         
	A lot of people were saying before the Middlesbrough game that it was done and dusted, Giggs said.         
	But we know we have tough games coming up. So have Arsenal and Chelsea, so there will be lots of twists and turns. There are five games to go and every game is a little final. Well be looking to win every game and were capable of doing it, but there are tough games coming up and well have to be at our best.

                                                   Pathan: Session with Wasimbhai helped

           
	Man of the Match Irfan Pathan, who took three wickets for 54 in the fourth innings and also contributed 46 runs with the bat in Indias second innings, also spoke to the media after the Perth Test on Saturday. The following are excerpts: 
    
	Im pretty satisfied with my performance in this Test. When Anilbhai gave me the new ball, I was pretty happy Starting the attack is always a special feeling and giving the team early breakthroughs is what I always aim for. I always want to do it, but sometimes it doesnt happen. Im pretty happy with the way I batted and bowled. 
    
	Bad times are bound to happen. I worked at the MRF Pace Foundation and with our bowling coach (Venkatesh Prasad). Its important that I feel good when bowling. The way I have been bowling is the result of my hard work in the past year. 
    
	Im not a fast bowler, I am a medium-pacer who bowls in the right areas. My job is to do the job my captain wants me to. I am a bowler first and would also like to contribute to the team with the bat. 
    
	I had a session with Wasimbhai (Wasim Akram) in Sydney. He gave me some tips which were pretty useful.

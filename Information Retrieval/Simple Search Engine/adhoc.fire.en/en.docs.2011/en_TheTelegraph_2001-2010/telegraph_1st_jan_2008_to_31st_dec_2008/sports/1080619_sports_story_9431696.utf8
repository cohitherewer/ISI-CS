                                                                                                                                                                                                     Woods a class apart: SSP 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The sore knee may have ruled out Tiger Woods for the rest of the season, but top Indian golfers, who have assembled in the city to play in the PGTI Players Championship, are without doubt that the US Open champion is made of different material altogether.         
	He is a completely different golfer from the others, there is absolutely no comparison of Woods with anybody He is a class apart, said reigning Indian Masters champion S.S.P. Chowrasia.         
	The Calcutta-lad, who had played with Woods in a tournament in Miami around mid-March, said the difference in the nature of the golf courses and the grooming that players like Woods receive at their young age make them different from the Indians.         
	The grooming at the start of the career is very important. The golf courses abroad are so long we play in such small courses. It makes the Europeans such long-hitters, which is a definite advantage, Chowrasia said.         
	The other city-lad Rahil Gangjee said that for his generation Woods was like god in golf. He is touched by God. How does he do it over and over again? a bemused Gangjee said when asked about his reaction on Woods US Open victory.         
	Its all about his mental strengthhe is physically and mentally stronger than any golfer.         
	Harendra Gupta rued the lack of proper opportunities and sponsors at the start of their career, as the differentiating factor in the career graph of the Indian golfers.

                                                   Fine gesture by Mike Procter

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Perth: The Indians are cut up with Match Referee Mike Procter for holding Harbhajan Singh guilty of a racist abuse, but that didnt stop the Protean from warmly congratulating Rahul Dravid for a quality knock at the Waca. 
    
	Their paths crossed (in The Telegraphs presence) on Wednesday evening when Dravid headed for the dressing room after a Q amp;A session with the media and Procter was moving towards one of the exits. 
    
	Well done, Procter told Dravid, patting the former India captain on his left shoulder and shaking hands. 
    
	A fine gesture that.

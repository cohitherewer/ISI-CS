                                                   India right up there: Hussey

           
	Adelaide: India have proved themselves in different conditions and they are the biggest thorn in the flesh for Ricky Ponting and his men, Australia middle-order batsman Mike Hussey has said. 
    
	India are right up there. They have proved themselves abroad, at home In all conditions, said Hussey after the hosts arrived here for the final Test starting Thursday. 
    
	Some very tough cricket has been played in this series and they have my highest regards, Hussey said. 
    
	They used the conditions very well in Perth. I dont think its going to swing as much in Adelaide, Hussey said. 
    
	Having said that, they are obviously a very fine bowling unit Very balanced, be it a matter of swing, seam or spin. 
    
	Hussey didnt believe his side made the mistake of taking the Indian pace attack lightly given their inexperience and that they were not the first choice in the series. 
    
	Any bowler who bowls at this level ought to be a good bowler. We dont make the mistake of treating anyone lightly. 
    
	We prepare very well against all opponents and with India it was no different in Perth, Hussey said. 
    
	The middle-order batsman was forthright in his assessment of their stunning defeat at the Waca, blaming the batsmen for the first innings debacle and poor shot selection. 
    
	Our shot selection wasnt very good. I personally was very disappointed at the shot I played in the first innings at a wide swinging delivery. In the second innings, I tried to play with discipline and caution and somewhat redeemed my approach of first knock.

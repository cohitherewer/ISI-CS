	Wijk Aan Zee: Viswanathan Anand won his first game handing Judit Polgar a defeat in the seventh round of Corus Granmasters chess tournament. Anand thus avenged his loss 10 years ago. 
    
	Anand took 53 moves to settle the game in Sicilian Najdorf. It was Anands first win and first loss for Polgar in this years event. The win helped Anand find back his way in the tournament he has won five times. Anand (3.5 points) now share the fifth place with five others. 
    
	It was a good day for the Indians, as Koneru Humpy also got her first win in group B. Parimarjan Negi also won his fourth game in group C. Only Pentala Harikrishna drew his game. 
    
	Humpy registered her first win beating the strong Polish opponent Michael Krasenkow in a Modern defence, where the game went as long as 94 moves before the Indian won. Humpy moved up to tied 10th with three points. 
    
	In another marathon battle lasting 122 moves, Harikrishna drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi in Ruy Lopez, Modern Steinitz. Harikrishna is tied third with four points while Sergei Movsesian and Etienne Bacrot of France lead with five points each. Hari is tied third with Jan Smeets, Nigel Short, Daniel Stellwagen. 
    
	Negi won his fourth game beating American Irina Krush in just 39 moves following a Sicilian Rauzer opening. Negi now has four points and is tied for sixth. 
    
	Anand lost the Sicilian game in 1998, and was in trouble this time too. Polgar got close to a winning advantage but Anand turned the flow as the former tried to settle for a draw. But the Indian star was quick to wrap it up in 53 moves. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City coaches call for balance
                                                                                                                                                                                                     City coaches call for balance
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The coaches of the I-League teams in Calcutta were largely satisfied after their meeting with national coach Bob Houghton on Thursday. They, however, felt too much emphasis on the requirements of the national team may weaken the domestic structure.         
	Houghtons suggestions are good and positive but the game in India needs to be balanced between the domestic and the international commitments, said one of the coaches.         
	The coaches, according to sources, pointed out that the India team players stayed too long with the national team and then returned to play for the clubs straightaway without getting adequate rest. The national coach, it is believed, explained to the coaches why it was necessary to keep the players in the camp for a long period.         
	Houghton, it seems, is very much anxious to set the I-League in order and play it simultaneously with the state leagues in Calcutta and Goa, one coach told The Telegraph.         
	It is definitely a good idea, but in that case, the national coach should also chalk out a detailed plan about the second division I-League.

                                                                                                                                                                                           Phelps tells of days gone by
                      
	New York: The closest Michael Phelps bid for an unprecedented eight Olympic gold medals came to being ruined was on one turn when he wasnt even in the pool.         
	In his book No Limits: The Will to Succeed to be released in the US on Tuesday, Phelps recalls how American teammate Jason Lezak was nearly a full length behind Frenchman Alain Bernard on the final turn of the 400-meter freestyle relay at the Beijing Olympics, putting his bid for a historic eighth gold medal in jeopardy.         
	But Bernard made a stupid, and what would turn out to be colossal, mistake that allowed Lezak to pull out an amazing comeback victory.         
	In the book, co-authored by Alan Abrahamson of the NBCOlympics.com website, Phelps describes himself as a child who was given to whining and crying, and with his big ears and scrawny build, was constantly being picked on. In sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and a doctor prescribed the stimulant Ritalin.         
	Phelps took three doses daily during the week, including a lunch-time dose that required a trip to the school nurses office, which made him stand out among his classmates.         
	By seventh grade, Phelps told his mother he wanted to stop taking Ritalin. I viewed it as an unnecessary crutch. he writes. He was later weaned off the medicine.         
	Phelps mother, Debbie, became a recognisable face in the stands at the Water Cube during the Beijing Olympics. But his father, Fred, wasnt there and is never mentioned publicly by Phelps.         
	In the book, he offers a brief glimpse of their early years together, recalling how his father took him fishing and to Baltimore Orioles games. He taught me to look people in the eye when I was meeting them and to shake hands like I meant it, Phelps writes.         
	Unquestionably, I inherited my competitive athletic drive from him. If I was playing sports, no matter what it was, my fathers direction was simple: Go hard and, remember, good guys finish second.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A test of Indias bench strength

	Cuttack: Team India, having already bagged the series, will look to test their bench strength when they take on England in the fifth match of the ODI series here on Wednesday.         
	The seven-match series has been a completely one-sided affair so far. The visitors will literally need to produce something out of the ordinary to stop the Indian juggernaut from a 7-0 sweep.         
	Five Indians  Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Munaf Patel  skipped the optional practice session on Tuesday.         
	Zaheer looks set to earn a well-deserved rest on Wednesday and Irfan Pathan, who replaced RP Singh in the squad after the first three ODIs, might get a look-in.         
	Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha will replace Harbhajan, in case the team management decides to give him a break before the Test series.         
	Virat Kohli, in place of Sehwag, might be the only change in the batting department.         
	The England team decided to skip practice on the eve of the match. The visitors planned to go out for some rugby in Bhubaneswar, but security concerns didnt allow them to do so.         
	England have thrown everything they possibly can at the Indians in this series. But nothing has been of help so far.         
	They have tried sending Ravi Bopara as an opener but that has only managed to lend some solidarity at the top of the order.         
	They have moved their best batsman, captain Kevin Pietersen, to the No. 3 spot. But the captain has failed to set the scoreboards ablaze.         
	Off-spinner Graeme Swann was brought into the playing XI to keep a check on the rampaging Indian batsmen. Swann, however, only managed to reduce the margin of defeat.         
	Allrounder Andrew Flintoff remains the best bowling option for England and Pietersen has to use him judiciously. The visitors will probably be better served by bringing back Steve Harmison into the side in place of James Anderson.         
	Anderson has looked completely out of sorts in this series and his line and length has, more often than not, gone haywire under attack from the Indians.         
	Andersons bowling is almost similar to Indian left-arm pacer R.P. Singh  both rely heavily on swing and movement off the seam. Swing and seam movement have been completely missing so far in the series and this has rendered Anderson ineffective.         
	Harmisons ability to extract good bounce off the pitch might prove to be handy here.         
	The toss on Wednesday will be a tricky one. The match, being a day-night affair, will definitely bring the dew factor into play. Both captains will be hard-pressed to bat first, if they win the toss, but the plight of the spinners with the wet ball will make them think twice.         
	According to locals, the dew starts coming down at around 7.30 in the night, which should be about 30 minutes into the second session of play.         
	All said and done, the Indians have played far too superior cricket in this series than the Englishmen.         
	Pietersens comments after the last match in Bangalore came as an ample reflection.         
	At the end of the day weve been done in by an Indian side who are playing great cricket at the moment, Pietersen said after the 19-run loss in the fourth match of the series.         
	Its high time for the visitors to wake up from their state of awe and play for pride.         
	Otherwise, all money will be on India to complete a clean sweep in the series and take over the official No. 2 spot in ODI rankings behind Australia.

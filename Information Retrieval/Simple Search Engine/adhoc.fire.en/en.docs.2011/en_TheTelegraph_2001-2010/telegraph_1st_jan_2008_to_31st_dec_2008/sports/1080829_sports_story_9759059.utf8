The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Power cut again
                                                                                                                                                                                           Power cut again
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Salt Lake Stadium was plagued by a power cut yet again while a match was on, when the lights went off in the 69th minute of the Sahara CFL Premier Division match between Mohammedan Sporting and George Telegraph on Thursday.         
	The stadium was completely dark for six minutes. Though the floodlights gradually came back to life, power was not restored to the press box.         
	Referee Biplab Poddar consulted fellow officials and the two captains, Maduako Francis and Mike Okoro, before deciding to resume the match.         
	They had to wait for 19 minutes for a playable amount of light.         
	Match commissioner Jayanta Banerjee, speaking to the media during the power cut, said: This is an unforeseen situation and as of now we dont know the reason behind this.         
	Notably, back in 2004, the India versus Japan World Cup qualifier was delayed by half an hour at the start of the second half because of a similar power failure.         
	George Telegraph and Mohammedan Sporting players might consider themselves jinxed, as their first leg tie, too, was marred by rain.         
	 That match was once abandoned and then delayed for 45 minutes at the Barasat stadium.

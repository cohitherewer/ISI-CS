The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paul helps East grab initiative
                                                     Paul helps East grab initiative
                  Shib Shankar Paul took four for 60                     
	Rajkot: Disciplined bowling by Shib Shankar Paul and Debasis Mohanty helped East Zone restrict defending champions North Zone at 260 after losing seven wickets on the opening day of four-day Duleep Trophy match at the Madhavrao Scindia ground on Monday.         
	North Zone skipper Mithun Manhas won the toss and decided to bat. But openers, Aakash Chopra and Shikhar Dhawan, failed a good start.         
	Paul provided the breakthrough by scalping Chopra (10) and then dismissed Karan Goel for naught.         
	While his new ball partner Debasis Mohanty got Dhawan (18) and reduced North to 27 for three in the first hour of play.         
	But a defiant knock by North captain Manhas and his two useful partnerships with Yashpal Singh (25) and Rajat Bhatia (24) helped his side recover from the early jolts.         
	Manhas made 88 facing 131 balls which included 13 fours and one six.         
	But, Uday Kaul and Amit Mishra frustrated the East bowlers by a 76-runs partnership for the seventh wicket before latter was caught by Wriddhiman Saha off Paul. Mishra made a 86-ball 52 hitting seven boundaries.         
	For East Zone, Paul was the wrecker-in-chief claiming four wickets for 60 runs, while Mohanty took two for 28.           (PTI)

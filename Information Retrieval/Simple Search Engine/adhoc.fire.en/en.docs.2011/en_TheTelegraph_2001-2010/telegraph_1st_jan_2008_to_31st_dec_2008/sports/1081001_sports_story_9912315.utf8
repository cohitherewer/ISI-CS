The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan to miss Bhutia
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bagan to miss Bhutia
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will miss Bhaichung Bhutia in their next couple of I-League matches after the India captain aggravated a calf muscle injury during practice at the club ground on Monday.         
	Defender Deepak Mondal will also sit out Bagans next match against Air India on Friday. Deepak skipped practice on Tuesday complaining of back pain.         
	Habibur Rehman Mondal, out with an injury since the last match in the Calcutta Football League (CFL), is also unavailable. Custodian Sangram Mukherjee is also likely to miss Fridays game due to injury.         
	Bhaichung, who played a very small part in Bagans title-winning campaign in the CFL because of national commitments and injury, will be given time to recover fully, coach Karim Bencharifa said on Tuesday.         
	He needs to rest for at least a couple of weeks and is most likely to miss the next two matches, the Moroccan coach said. The I-League is a long tournament. We dont want to risk Bhaichung. He has been advised rest for a couple of weeks.         
	Bagan, who made a dismal start to their I-League campaign losing the first match, play their third match (away) against Sporting Clube de Goa on October 11.

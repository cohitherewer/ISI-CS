The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nielsen defends rookie Krejza
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nielsen defends rookie Krejza
                      
	Hyderabad: Coach Tim Nielsen sprang to the defence of rookie off-spinner Jason Krejza, who received quite a battering from the Board Presidents XI batsmen here on Thursday.         
	With Bryce McGain ruled out of the first Test against India  he might miss the second as well  owing to a shoulder injury, Krejza is almost certain to make his debut in the longer version of the game when Australia take on India in Bangalore on October 9. But if his bowling on Thursday is anything to go by, the 25-year-old spinner is in for a tough time, even though Nielsen believes otherwise.         
	Its a bit harsh on him (to suggest he was hit all over the park), Nielsen said of the spinner, whose 20 overs of wicketless toil yielded 123 runs, including a few moral-shattering sixes.         
	It was his first game with the Australian side and the guy was pretty nervous for the last two days. But I believe he is going to do well, Nielsen said, oozing a die-hard optimism.         
	There are some nice signs for him. Those boundaries put some pressure on him but he still was trying things like going over the wicket to the left-handers. The 20 overs he bowled on Thursday was a good experience for him, he added.         
	Incidentally, Rohit Sharma, who virtually toyed with the spinner en route to his 105, refused to rate the spinner.         
	Nielsen was impressed by both the Indian centurions but was not surprised that Rohit and Virat Kohli were not part of the Indian Test squad.         
	They played really well. But I think the senior players have performed over a long period. I think they would have to wait for their turn. They would definitely get their opportunity some time.         
	They played beautifully today and its nice to see a couple of youngsters putting their hands up and pushing for selection, he added.           (PTI)

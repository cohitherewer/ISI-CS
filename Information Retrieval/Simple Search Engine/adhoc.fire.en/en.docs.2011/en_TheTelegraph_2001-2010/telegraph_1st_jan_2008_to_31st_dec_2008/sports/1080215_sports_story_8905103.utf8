	London: Werder Bremen goalkeeper Tim Wiese saved two first-half penalties as the Bundesliga side began their Uefa Cup campaign with a 3-0 win over Braga on Wednesday.         
	Werder, parachuted into the last 32 of the competition from the Champions League, profited from Bragas wasteful finishing at the Weserstadion to take full command of the first knockout round tie.         
	Olympique Marseille, PSV Eindhoven and Sporting, also entering the competition after finishing third in their Champions League groups, also eased to first-leg wins at home.         
	Wiese kept out Roland Linzs 10th-minute spot kick to maintain Werders early lead given to them by Brazilian centre-back Naldo, back after missing Sundays Bundesliga draw with title rivals Bayern Munich through suspension.         
	Daniel Jensen increased Werders advantage before Wiese again came to the rescue, keeping out Jorginhos penalty nine minutes before half-time.         
	Werders Portuguese striker Hugo Almeida rubbed salt into Bragas wounds in second-half stoppage time when he showed his compatriots how to score from the spot.         
	Marseille took 62 minutes to break down Spartak Moscow before Benoit Cheyrous opener was quickly followed by goals from Taye Taiwo and Mamadou Niang in a 3-0 win.         
	Timmy Simons and Danko Lazovic got the goals as PSV overcame Helsingborg 2-0 while Sporting midfielder Simon Vukcevic scored twice as the Portuguese beat Basel 2-0.         
	Anderlecht substitute Mbo Mpenza scored a last-gasp winner just seconds after coming on in stoppage time to hand the Belgians a 2-1 win over Girondins Bordeaux in Brussels.         
	There was also late drama in Athens where AEK, who dismissed Spanish coach Lorenzo Serra Ferrer on Tuesday after slipping to third in the Greek Super League, salvaged a 1-1 draw with Getafe.         
	Pavel Pogrebnyaks second-half goal handed Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg a 1-0 win at home to Villarreal.         
	Everton took control of their tie with Norwegian champions Brann Bergen after second-half goals from Leon Osman and Victor Anichebe secured a 2-0 away win.         
	Osman scored with a superb strike from outside the penalty area 13 minutes into the second half and Anichebes close-range finish two minutes from time sealed Evertons sixth successive European win.         
	Brann, who have played only Uefa Cup games in the three months since winning the title last November, rarely troubled the English Premier League side.         
	Former winners Galatasaray and Bayer Leverkusen battled to a goalless draw in Istanbul, as did Rangers and Panathinaikos at Ibrox.           (REUTERS)

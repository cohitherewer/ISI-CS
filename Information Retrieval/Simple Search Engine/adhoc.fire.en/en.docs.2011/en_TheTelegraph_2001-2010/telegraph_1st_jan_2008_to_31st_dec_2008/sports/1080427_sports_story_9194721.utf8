	Dallas: Daniel Chopras woeful run of form continued as he carded a second successive four-over 74 to miss the cut in the $6.4 million Byron Nelson championship.         
	The Swede of Indian origin, who was tied for the 104th spot overnight, signed off with a total of eight-over 148, five strokes below the cut-line.         
	Chopra dropped the first of his four bogeys on the par-four third hole. The birdie on fourth brought him back on par but dropped strokes on the sixth and ninth saw him make the turn two-over. The Swedes back-nine was off to a fine start as he picked up a birdie on the 10th but it all went downhill from there as he first bogeyed the 15th before a double-bogey on the 17th completed his outing.

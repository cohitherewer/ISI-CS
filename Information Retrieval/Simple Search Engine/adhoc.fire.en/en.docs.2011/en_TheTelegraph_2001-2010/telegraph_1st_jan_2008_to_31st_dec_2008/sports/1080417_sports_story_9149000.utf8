	New Delhi: Australian fast bowling great Dennis Lillee on Wednesday joined Delhi DareDevils.         
	Lillee would be an adviser of the sports management of GMR, which owns IPL franchise.         
	It feels great to be a part of Delhi DareDevils. Ive known many of the young players in the squad. While players like Glenn McGrath are legends by their own right, I am looking forward to work with upcoming talents such as Pradeep Sangwan and Yomahesh, he said.         
	Captain Virender Sehwag said Lillees presence would inspire his team to do well in the Twenty20 extravaganza. Lillee has been a childhood idol and an inspiration to countless cricketers, including me. His do-or-die attitude, fierce determination and the way he staged his comeback are parts of cricketing lore. His presence in the dressing room will no doubt bolster our resolve to win, Sehwag said.         
	In Mumbai, former Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya said he was excited to play with Sachin Tendulkar for Mumbai Indians.         
	I am very happy I will play with Sachin. Besides, I will also get an opportunity to start the innings with him, said the former Sri Lankan captain.         
	Robin Uthappa, believes youngsters in the side would learn a lot by rubbing shoulders with legends like Sachin, Jayasuriya and Shaun Pollock. (PTI)

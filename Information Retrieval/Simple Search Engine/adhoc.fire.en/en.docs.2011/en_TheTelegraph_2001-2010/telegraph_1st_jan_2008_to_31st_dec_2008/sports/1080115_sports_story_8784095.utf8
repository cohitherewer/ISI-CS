                                                     Whitney blames it on Symonds

   SHARP SINGLES - Down Under
   
	 Former Australian fast bowler Mike Whitney blamed Andrew Symonds for sparking the row with India. He asked both teams to grow up and behave like men. Whitney said the incident would not have exploded if Symonds had not chided Harbhajan Singh for tapping Brett Lee on the backside. 
 
	I think Symonds was to blame for starting the whole thing, Whitney told Australias Daily Telegraph. All Harbhajan did to start with was to tap Brett Lee on the backside. Greg Matthews and I used to do that sort of thing all the time in a jovial way. 
 
	Lots of other sportspeople, particularly in the footy codes, tap each other on the backside all the time and there is nothing sinister meant by that. Harbhajan was probably just asking Brett how he was or saying well bowled and having a bit of harmless banter. I would like to ask Symonds why he took exception to that, the former Test cricketer said.
 
	Got my rhythm back: Sehwag
 
	 Hoping for a comeback in the Perth Test, Virender Sehwag said he was not concerned about the Aussie attack in the bouncy Waca wicket. I have got my rhythm back. I have got everything back, the Delhi batsman told Herald Sun. 
 
	I think the Perth wicket is good for me and good for batsmen. The ball comes on with pace and bounce so you can play your shots. Its a true wicket for both batsmen and bowlers and I love fresh challenges, so if I play against four fast bowlers, then its great for me. I will try to play with a positive mindset and play my shots, Sehwag was quoted as saying by Herald Sun.
 
	Sehwag was out of the Test team for a year but his innings of 113 from 78 balls in Indias drawn three-day practise match against ACT Invitational XI, coupled with Wasim Jaffers failures, has put Sehwag in contention for a recall in Wednesdays third Test.

                                                Air India hold Dempo
                      
	Margao: A stout defending and a couple of good saves by keeper Arnab Das Sharma of Air India denied Dempo full points as both settled for a goalless draw in the 15th round of ONGC I-League played at Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday.         
	Dempo who dominated the match throughout were unlucky in the dying minutes as Ranty Martins shot hit the post. With this draw, Dempo maintained their top spot with 31 points from 15 matches. They are closely followed by Churchill Brothers (29), Mohun Bagan (27) and JCT (26), while Air India took their tally to 17 points from 15 matches.         
	Air Indias defender Nirmal Chettri who played his heart out was declared Man of the Match.         
	Earlier, Air India keeper Arnab pulled out a good save by blocking Edeh Chidi header off a combined move from the right by Roberto and Martins. (PTI)

                                                   Waugh praise for Pathan

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Irfan Pathan allround show in the Perth Test has earned him an admirer in Steve Waugh. 
    
	Pathan has the potential to become an outstanding Test match allrounder. The poise he showed to bat throughout the first session Friday confirmed this, the former Australian captain wrote in his column for Australias Daily Telegraph. 
    
	When I first saw him four years ago I marvelled at the way he could swing the ball both ways and it has been surprising to see him dropped because of poor form and only appear for the third Test of the series. 
    
	But it is a recurring problem in India for youngsters such as Pathan to become flooded with rich sponsorships when they hit the big time, become a bit starstruck by it all, then stop doing the little things that got them there in the first place. 
    
	Yuvraj Singh is the obvious example. He lost his way after the stardom of hitting six sixes in a Twenty20 match and simply does not look the finished article as an international player. Time out of the side has given Pathan more balance in life and hardened his game, Waugh wrote. 
    
	He also praised Brett Lee. Lee is becoming more like Glenn McGrath everyday.

	Karachi: Paceman Sohail Tanvir and Shahid Afridi took three wickets apiece as Pakistan crushed Bangladesh by 152 runs in the first one-day international under Duckworth Lewis method after power interruptions at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Tuesday.         
	Bangladesh was bowled out for 129 runs in 29.5 overs in reply to Pakistans 322 for five. Their target had been reduced to 282 in 39 overs after power failures twice interrupted the day and night game.         
	Mohammed Yousuf scored his 15th one-day century for Pakistan, hitting 108 from 103 balls. Left-arm pacer Tanvir rocked Bangladesh with three wickets in his opening spell, dismissing Tamim Iqbal (5), Shahriar Nafees (24) and Aftab Ahmed (14).         
	Iqbal lost his off stump playing a loose shot while the others were snapped up by Kamran Akmal who ended with four dismissals in the innings.         
	Bangladesh never recovered from their early slide and the power interruptions didnt help as they lost wickets regularly.         
	Tail-ender Mashrafe Mortaza top-scored with 25 as Tanvir claimed three for 29 and Afridi three for 41.           (REUTERS)

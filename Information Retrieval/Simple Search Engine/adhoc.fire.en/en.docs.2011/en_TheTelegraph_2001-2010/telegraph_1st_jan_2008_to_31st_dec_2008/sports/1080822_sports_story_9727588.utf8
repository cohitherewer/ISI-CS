The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Too early for Mendis mania: Kapil
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Too early for Mendis mania: Kapil
                  Kapil Dev                     
	Jalandhar: The legendary Kapil Dev on Thursday praised Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis for his splendid show against India so far but felt the media was going overboard with the coverage of the bowler, who had to still prove his credentials.         
	No doubt that Mendiss performance in the on-going India-Sri Lanka series is very good but the media has highlighted him a bit too prominently. It is too early to say if he will continue to perform like this for long, said Kapil, who was here to attend a function.         
	So far Mendis has done extraordinary well and launched his cricket career in a marvellous way, but the Indian batsmen are capable enough to tackle his bowling, he added.         
	Pointing out the injuries of players due to too much cricket in the BCCIs calendar, Kapil evaded a direct reply and said it was up to players to decide whether it was really too much cricket.         
	Kapil, who is also the chairman of the Indian Cricket League (ICL), said there would be many changes in the upcoming second league of ICL.         
	Regarding growth of the ICL, Kapil said it was just a one-year- old baby and how could one expect it to grow overnight.         
	In the years to come, ICL would open academies in several cities, he added.         
	Kapil congratulated Abhinav Bindra, Vijender Kumar and Sushil Kumar for winning Olympic medals and said that now people and the government would think of other sports as well.         
	Government should concentrate on all sports if India likes to improve its tally in the medal list of the Olympic, he said. (PTI)

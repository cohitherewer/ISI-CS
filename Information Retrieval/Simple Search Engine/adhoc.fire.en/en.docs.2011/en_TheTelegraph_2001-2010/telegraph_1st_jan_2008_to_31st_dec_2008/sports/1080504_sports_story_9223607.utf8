The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | FRIDAY TO FRIDAY - Review of IPLs week No. 2
                                                                                                                                                                                                     FRIDAY TO FRIDAY - Review of IPLs week No. 2
                        
	 Deccan Chargers 10-wicket victory over the Mumbai Indians was the first such win in the IPL. Incidentally, it was only the 11th victory by this margin by a team in the history of Twenty20 cricket. Last season, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab had registered wins by 10 wickets against Vidarbha and Jammu amp; Kashmir, respectively               
	 Deccan Chargers margin of victory, with 48 balls remaining, was the second biggest win by an Indian team in Twenty20               
	 Adam Gilchrists (Deccan Chargers) unbeaten 109 against Mumbai Indians at the DY Patil Stadium in New Mumbai was not only his maiden Twenty20 century but the joint third-fastest in the history of Twenty20 cricket. It came in 42 balls.               
	 Gilchrists 10 sixes during the above knock makes him only the third batsman after Brendon McCullum (13 sixes) and Chris Gayle (10) to hit 10 or more sixes in an innings.               
	 Gilchrists century was only the second century by a batsman who kept wickets in the same match. Moin Khan had made 112 for Karachi Dolphins against Lahore Lions in Lahore in April 2005         
	 The first-wicket unbeaten partnership of 155 between Gilchrist and V.V.S. Laxman was the first ever 150-plus stand made for any wicket in a Twenty20 game on Indian soil. The previous best was the 149-run stand for the fifth wicket between Yogesh Takawale and Sairaj Bahutule for Maharashtra against Gujarat in 2006-07.               
	 Kolkata Knight Riders David Husseys two sixes against Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur takes his tally to 51 in 50 matches. He became the first batsman in Twenty20 history to achieve this feat               
	 Hussey, incidentally, became only the second player in Twenty20 to play 50 or more matches. He is just two behind South Africas Martin van Jaarsveld (52 matches)

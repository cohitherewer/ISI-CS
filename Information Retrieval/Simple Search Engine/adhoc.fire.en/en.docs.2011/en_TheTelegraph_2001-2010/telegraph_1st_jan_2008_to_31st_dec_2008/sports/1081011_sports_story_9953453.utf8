The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I had a point to prove: Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                           I had a point to prove: Ponting
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: Ricky Ponting finally managed to reach his maiden hundred in India on the opening day of the Test. In 14 innings prior to this here, he had averaged 12.28. His 123 came in 329 minutes and included 13 fours. The Australian captain termed the century as very satisfying.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His maiden Test century in India         
	Im as pleased with the innings as I have been with any innings I have ever played. I had played eight Test matches here before with a highest score of 60, so I had some work to do, and I guess I had a point to prove to a few people as well. It was nice to make my first hundred here. It was satisfying         
	If he was under pressure to perform         
	At no stage today (Thursday) did I put any extra pressure on myself to try and combat anything the bowlers were doing. It was about watching the ball and playing it on its merits, and trusting my defensive technique         
	On whether he was defensive in approach         
	I dont think we were that defensive The Indians had a few guys out on the fence pretty early in the day, so a lot of boundary-scoring options were taken away from us. It wasnt a pretty good wicket to score on, there was not much bounce and there wasnt much pace eitherIt wasnt perfect batting conditions.         
	His thoughts on a good knock         
	My record here has been poor and I have been working hard and doing my best to rectify that. Today is one step in the right direction and its nice to get the team to a good position. But one innings doesnt make a tour.

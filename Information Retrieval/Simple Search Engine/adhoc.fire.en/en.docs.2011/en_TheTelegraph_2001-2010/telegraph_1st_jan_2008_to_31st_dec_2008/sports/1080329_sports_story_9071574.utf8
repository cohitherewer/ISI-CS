The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My best Test innings ever, says Sehwag
                                                   My best Test innings ever, says Sehwag
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Chennai: An hour after stumps on Day III, Virender Sehwag arrived for the news conference fresh after an ice bath. Basking in the glory of his second triple hundred, he said this was his best innings ever.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His innings         
	I dont have words to express my feelings... I dont think I showed so much patience and concentration in Multan. I wanted to prove to myself that I belong here and there is no better way than scoring a triple century.         
	The feeling         
	It feels great, I am proud of myself. I am pretty happy with my cricket.         
	The plan for Saturday         
	Our plan is to play till tea and then we will decide what to do.         
	How he tackled Paul Harris         
	I was trying not to let him settle down. If I decided to pad down his negative line then may be I would not have scored 300 the whole day. I was positive because I knew that the wicket was not that rough and there wouldnt be much spin. I was confident that whenever I stepped down the wicket or played the reverse sweep, it would connect and it did.         
	How he rates this knock         
	I will say this is my best Test innings because I made 300 and scored at more than a run a ball.         
	Was he thinking about Brian Laras record         
	Not at all Anil Kumble told me that my job was to stay till the end. Even tomorrow when I come in to bat I wont be thinking about it. I will just look to bat for one session and if I can bat till lunch, Ill come close to Laras record.         
	His game plan at the start of the day         
	I was trying to take it session by session. Trying to play for 40 minutes, take some water and again play for 40 minutes I wasnt thinking about 200 or 300. Only when I was around 20 runs away that I started to think about it and played some shots.         
	If he is feeling tired         
	I dont think I am tired I am feeling fresh after the ice bath. My face will tell you that I am pretty fresh now. I also took an ice bath during lunch... I took it for almost 8-10 minutes now.         
	How tough was it in the middle         
	It is difficult in Chennai because its very humid. You lose a lot of water and salt from your body. All credit to physio (Paul Close) and Paddy (Upton) who were sending me salt and coconut water every time the drinks came on. I want to thank even my teammates Irfan Pathan, Piyush Chawla and Yuvraj Singh, who were looking after me during the drinks breaks.         
	If he wants to dedicate this innings         
	I would like to dedicate it to my family, especially my dad. He is not with us but always hoped that I play for India and score a lot of runs. I would like to dedicate my triple century to my father, my family, my wife and son. They have also played a role because we dont spend much time together. They always motivate me to perform better.         
	Which of the two triple hundreds is better         
	I think this one because I scored at run a ball. In Multan, the wicket was better than this and the conditions were not so hot and humid.         
	If he was taking too many chances         
	My theory is simple If there is a ball to be hit, Ill hit it. It doesnt matter whether I am batting on 90 or 150 or whether I am close to 200. I even tried to hit a six when I was on 298 but missed it. I always play like that and I have grown playing like that Thats my natural instinct.         
	On back to back hundreds         
	The team wanted something from me in Adelaide. Anilbhai told me that you have to stay there till the end after the tea break because we dont want to lose the Test. Thats why I became cautious and told myself since I have got my hundred, now I will play for the team. Here, too, I was playing for the team. I know I can hit the ball, so why not maintain a run rate of four per over so that we have a good chance to win the match. If you get a lead of 150-200, we have a good chance because they may have to play the final day.         
	On making a comeback         
	When I was dropped from the Test squad I was hurt because I have a good record in Tests. So I was looking to prove myself That I am a good Test player and deserve a place in the team. It hurt to get dropped from the team but it was also good for me because I was able to motivate myself and concentrate better.         
	If Rahul Dravid needed to speed up things         
	I think that is Rahuls style of batting. You cannot question it because that is how he goes about it. Our understanding was so good that we never thought that runs were not coming. Rahul played the way that he always does. Hopefully, tomorrow he will bat more positively and look to score some quick runs.         
	If consultations with Paddy Upton has helped         
	I am waiting for the solutions to my queries from him. When I get them I will be able to tell you

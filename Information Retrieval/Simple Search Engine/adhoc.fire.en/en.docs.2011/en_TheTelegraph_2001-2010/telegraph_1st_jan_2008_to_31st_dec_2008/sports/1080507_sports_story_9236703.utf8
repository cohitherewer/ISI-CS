	Sheffield: Ronnie OSullivan won his third world snooker title, beating Ali Carter 18-8 in the final on Monday.

	OSullivan collected a winners cheque for 250,000 and Carter collected half that amount as runner-up. The two finalists also won 78,500 for sharing the highest break of the championship, a maximum 147.

If explosives, biochemicals or other suspicious things are found, we will inform the police at once.

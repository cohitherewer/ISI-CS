The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Experience the greatest teacher, says Dravid
                                                                                                                                                                                             Experience the greatest teacher, says Dravid

	Mumbai: Coaching is important to groom future cricketers from Asian countries but experience and instinctive learning also plays a major role, former India captain Rahul Dravid said on Thursday.         
	I am all for an instinctive way of learning. Players in Asia have a lot of skill and platforms for their development in the form of wickets, stadiums and facilities, Dravid said at an awards function.         
	Players should not undergo excessive coaching and should be allowed to obtain varied experiences which help them learn more, he said.         
	The coach creates an environment to explore ones skills but experience is the greatest teacher. Players may initially need a mentor or guide and need to have a platform for their growth, Dravid said.         
	Former Pakistan captain and pace bowler Wasim Akram said cricketers from Asia were raw compared to their counterparts from Australia or England.         
	Our batsmen are more wristy, aggressive and do not listen to their coaches, he said.         
	In his career he had learnt a lot from peers like Imran Khan and Waqar Younis, he said.         
	I have always been of the opinion that if someone is good enough he should be in the side. If, for example, a player enters the national squad at 18 then by the time he is 22 he has had four years of valuable experience, Akram said.         
	However, Sri Lanka batsman Sanath Jayasuriya said young players should be given a chance to play in the A team and other sides before being drafted into the national side to help them cope with the pressure of international cricket.         
	We have a lot of talent in Asia  in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka but they need to be shown the right direction, Jayasuriya said at the same function.           (PTI)

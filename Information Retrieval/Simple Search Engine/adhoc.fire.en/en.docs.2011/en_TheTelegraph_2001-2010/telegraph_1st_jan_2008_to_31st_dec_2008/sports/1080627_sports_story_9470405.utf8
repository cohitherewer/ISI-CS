The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Loew bets on German spirit
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Loew bets on German spirit

	Basel: Germany coach Joachim Loew has a lot of work to do heading into Sundays Euro 2008 final but he can be confident that if all else fails the teams physical and mental strength can still get them out of trouble.         
	Germany did just about everything wrong in the semi-final against Turkey but despite making terrible mistakes in defence and relying on the hit-and-hope approach to building attacks, they came through a bruising match to win 3-2.         
	When Turkey equalised, it looked like Fatih Terims team were heading for another great escape but Germany showed they are made of sterner stuff than Switzerland, Czech Republic or Croatia as they snatched victory. Philipp Lahms late strike turned the tables on the Turks.         
	Weve got a victors mentality and want to win the title, said Loew. We didnt do what usually makes us strong. We started kicking high balls forward instead and the Turks were able to stop that.         
	Germany will face a different test in Sundays Vienna final, whether it is against Russia or Spain who meet on Thursday. Both those teams like to move the ball around, and neither will play such a tight pressing game.         
	 That is likely to work in Germanys favour.         
	Under Loew, the Germans look far more comfortable playing on the counter-attack than trying to build through midfield.           (REUTERS)

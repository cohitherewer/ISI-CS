                                                   EB eye draw in Beirut 
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: East Bengal will play for a draw against Safa in Beirut when they take on the Lebanese side in their AFC Cup opener on Tuesday.         
	Our primary objective will be a draw. Since it is an away match, well adopt a cautious approach and go for a win in the home tie, East Bengal coach Aloke Mukherjee said before leaving the city on Saturday.         
	The Federation Cup champions have been placed in group B, with Ahli Sanaa of Yemen and Jordans Al Wihdat being the other teams.         
	I-League champions Dempo SC, on the other hand, host another Lebanese outfit, Al Ansar at the Nehru Stadium in Margao.         
	The 18-member East Bengal squad will take a connecting flight for the Lebanese capital from Dubai in the wee hours on Sunday.

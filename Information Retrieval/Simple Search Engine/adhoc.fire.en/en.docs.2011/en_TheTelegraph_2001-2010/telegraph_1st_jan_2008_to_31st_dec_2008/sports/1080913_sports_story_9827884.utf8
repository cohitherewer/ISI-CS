	Bhatinda: Railways retained the National Boxing Championships by just one point, winning four of their five summit clashes, after hosts Punjab put paid to Services hopes with an upset win in the light-weight category on Friday.         
	Railways finished the championship bagging four gold, one silver and a bronze with 50 points, a point ahead of Services, who were followed by hosts Punjab (34) in the third place.         
	With their star boxers and last years champions Vijender Kumar, the middle-weight Olympic bronze winner, Jitender Kumar and Akhil Kumar, the Olympic quarter finalists, watching from the sidelines, Railways bounced back in style to wrest the title.         
	Local favourite Kuldeep Singh was declared the Best Boxer of the meet after he replaced Vijender as the new middle-weight national champion, beating Haryanas Manjeet. Servicesman Rakesh Kalskar was declared the Best Loser of the event.

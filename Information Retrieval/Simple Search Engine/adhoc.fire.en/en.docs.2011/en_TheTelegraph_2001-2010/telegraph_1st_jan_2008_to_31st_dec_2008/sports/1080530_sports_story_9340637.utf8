The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav needs Dhonis blessings for return
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sourav needs Dhonis blessings for return
  - Unfit Sachin out of tri-series, Asia Cup 
  -  Yusuf almost certain to make cut         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkars non-availability for the June 8-14 tri-series in Bangladesh and the June 24-July 6 Asia Cup in Pakistan appears to have opened the door somewhat for Sourav Gangulys return in ODIs.         
	However, as in January  when the last ODI squad was picked, for the tri-series in Australia  captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis views will carry the maximum weight.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, if Sourav doesnt make the Team India XV (the number talked about on Thursday afternoon) for the tri-series, he should make it for the Asia Cup.         
	But, then, Dhoni has to give the green signal. Of that, nobody has a doubt.         
	Souravs last ODI appearance was in Gwalior against Pakistan in mid-November 2007.         
	Not that Sourav actually set the Hooghly on fire in the Indian Premier League (IPL), but he did produce some quality performances for the Kolkata Knight Riders and remained fit throughout the league stage.         
	Clearly, Sourav hasnt lost his zest and also showed that he could be counted upon for a few overs with the white ball.         
	Karachi will be Team Indias base during the Asia Cup and the ball does do a bit there. Having Sourav around, therefore, wont be a bad idea.         
	Rahul Dravid, by the way, isnt in the frame at all. Its curtains for him in ODIs.         
	While its to be seen whether Dilip Vengsarkar and Co. recall Sourav, wholl turn 36 in July, its almost certain that Irfan Pathans elder brother, Yusuf, is going to make the cut.         
	It couldnt be confirmed, but the selectors may not pick a second specialist spinner (after Piyush Chawla), but look at Yusuf to deliver with his brand of off-spin in addition to hitting big.         
	Whats rather baffling, of course, is that Sachin played the Mumbai Indians last few IPL matches, but has now been ruled unfit for international commitments.         
	According to Board secretary Niranjan Shah, the Mumbai Indians physio, Nitin Patel, issued the not fit certificate. In the physios opinion, Sachin hasnt recovered fully from a groin injury.         
	The injury, which first surfaced in Australia earlier this year, has already made Sachin miss Team Indias last two Tests  Motera and Kanpur, against South Africa.         
	Shah, meanwhile, clarified that Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma were fit.         
	My information is that Sachin, Zaheer Khan and Murali Kartik are the only ones with fitness problems, Shah said late on Thursday.         
	Around the same time, there were whispers that Ishant Sharma would be rested for the tri-series.         
	Even if somebody like Manpreet Singh Gony doesnt get a look-in, hes bound to make the A squad for the Emerging meet in Australia. Perhaps, even a Wriddhiman Saha.         
	The selectors could have to choose two A squads too on Friday, the other one being for a path-breaking tour of Israel.         
	Vengsarkar and his colleagues probably have a long day ahead of them.         
	Shah has been calling for new players for the tri-series, but the Board has left it to the selectors to act in the best interests of the country.         
	Its no-interference stand is unlikely to change overnight.               
	(seniority-wise)  
	THOSE IN THE RECKONING FOR TEAM INDIA   
	 Openers: Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir.         
	 Middle-order batsmen: Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Y. Venugopal Rao, Robin Uthappa, Rohit Sharma, Subramaniam Badrinath, Abhishek Nayar, Ravindra Jadeja.         
	 Wicketkeepers: Dinesh Karthik, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt.).         
	 Allrounders: Irfan Pathan, Yusuf Pathan.         
	 Spinners: Amit Mishra, Piyush Chawla.         
	 Quicks/medium-pacers: Rudra Pratap Singh, Sreesanth, Munaf Patel, Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar, Manpreet Singh Gony.         
	 Outside chance: Mohammed Kaif, Manoj Tiwary.         
	 Dark horse: Parthiv Patel, Wriddhiman Saha.         
	Note: With Sachin and Harbhajan Singh not available for one reason or the other, and Tiwary having been an additional (17th) player in Australia, there could eventually be just one new face in the XV-strong squad for the tri-series  that of Yusuf.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team loses, but SRKs a winner
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Team loses, but SRKs a winner
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Shah Rukh bhai, Shah Rukh bhai, wailed a lungi-clad fan, whod broken his left leg in an earlier attempt to meet Bollywoods badshah, oblivious of the fact that Shah Rukh Khan had already zoomed off in his Mercedes.         
	Hed breached the security cordon and the cops had a tough time first restraining him and, then, convincing him that his hero had left the Eden.         
	That was around 8.15pm on Sunday, not long after the Kolkata Knight Riders versus Chennai Super Kings clash got decided on the Duckworth/Lewis Method.         
	For a change Shah Rukh left rather quickly, not because his team suffered another defeat, but because he was rushing back to Mumbai on a private jet.         
	Shooting of a new film of his (Aditya Chopras Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi) has, after all, just begun.         
	Given the circumstances, Shah Rukh didnt talk about the match. He also didnt react to Amitabh Bachchans offer to apologise if comments in his blog had left him offended.         
	No comments Nothing, Shah Rukh told The Telegraph. His response was the same when asked if hed accept Bachchans apology if it came via a personal call and not through the blog.         
	Im not saying anything No comments, Shah Rukh maintained as he headed for the footboard of his Mercedes to wave at the thousands whod been waiting to have a glimpse of him.         
	The Knight Riders are on a real dicey wicket now, but Shah Rukh remains a winner.         
	Its hardly a surprise that a common enough sentiment across the city (and elsewhere) is that the team should do well for Shah Rukhs sake, at least, if not for any other reason.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eves clinch gold in soccer
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Eves clinch gold in soccer
                      
	Beijing: Carli Lloyd scored in the sixth minute of extra time, giving the United States a 1-0 victory on Thursday over Brazil and the Olympic gold medal in womens football.         
	Outplayed for most of the game, the US snatched victory when Amy Rodriguez won a loose ball and found Lloyd to her left. The midfielder touched the ball once, and then drove a left-footed shot from just outside the 18-yard line that bounced and then skidded to the left of diving goalkeeper Barbara.         
	Germany and Spain gatecrashed into the Olympic mens field hockey final after avenging the heartbreak at Athens four years ago. Spain fought back after being two goals down to upset reigning Olympic champions Australia 3-2. Germany defeated The Netherlands 4-3 in a penalty shoot-out in the other semi-final after the European heavyweights were locked 1-1 at the end of extra-time.         
	The Americans had a nightmare night with both the women and men dropping their batons during the heats of the 4x100 metres relay to crash out. They also lost the final of womens softball, the first time they have failed to win gold in that event.         
	The failure in the relays, an unexpected loss in the final of the womens water polo to The Netherlands and defeat to Japan in the softball will be salt in the wounds for the Americans.         
	There was a US win in the mens 400m, where LaShawn Merritt beat defending champion Jeremy Wariner to deliver the seventh straight gold in the event for the Americans.         
	That will do little to chip at Chinas dominance in the medals table. They have a commanding 45 golds to the Americans 27, a lead that Beijing says shows it now has the sporting prowess to match its growing economic might and superpower clout.         
	Canadas Eric Lamaze, who missed two Olympics because of drugs bans, won the equestrian show jumping gold medal. In a thrilling climax to the equestrian events Lamaze put his past troubles behind him to beat Swede Rolf-Goran Bengtsson into silver. American Beezie Madden took bronze.         
	Lamaze, 40, was expelled from the Canadian team for 1996 and 2000 Games after testing positive for cocaine on two separate occasions, according to the official Olympic News Service.         
	Norways Tony Andre Hansen was provisionally suspended after his horse tested postive. Hansen was a member of the Norwegian team that won bronze in the team show jumping. The International Equestrian Federation has not made a decision on the medal.         
	The Americans enjoyed success in womens beach volleyball. An excited home crowd sheltered from torrential rain as Chinas Tian Jia and Wang Jie lost to the defending champions, US pair Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh, in straight sets.         
	May-Treanor and Walsh left the door open to a return in London 2012, but said that might depend on plans to have children.         
	Dutchman Maarten van der Weijden, given only a slim chance of survival when diagnosed with leukaemia seven years ago, won the 10km swim, one of the most testing Olympic events. As expected Cubas Dayron Robles won the 110 metres hurdles. (Reuters)

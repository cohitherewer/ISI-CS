The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF is still in a fix
                                                                                                                                                                                           AIFF is still in a fix
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: With less than two weeks to go for the start of the I-League, the All India Football Federation (AIFF), it seems, is not yet sure about fixing the venue for the Mumbai matches.         
	Even though the Cooperage ground in Mumbai was rejected as a venue by a team of observers earlier, the AIFF on Thursday sent an observer from Calcutta, Colonel Gautam Kar, for yet another round of inspection.         
	According to sources, the Western India Football Association (WIFA) officials have told Colonel Kar that they have raised the standard of facilities at the Cooperage, including the ground, dressing room and the spectators stands.         
	In a related development, two of the I-League clubs in Mumbai have offered to bear the cost of installing floodlights at the Cooperage.         
	The two clubs  Mumbai FC and Air India  have informed the WIFA that they are ready to bear a part of the Rs. 70 lakh project in case the WIFA and the AIFF manage to raise the rest of the money through sponsors.         
	We cannot allow the matches to go out of Mumbai, said a club official. We have already talked to a company, who have agreed to install floodlights in the next three weeks. It is now for the WIFA and the AIFF to take the initiative.         
	In this scenario the Mumbai teams are likely to play their first round of I-League matches outside the city.         
	Stephen Dias has agreed to play for Mahindra United.

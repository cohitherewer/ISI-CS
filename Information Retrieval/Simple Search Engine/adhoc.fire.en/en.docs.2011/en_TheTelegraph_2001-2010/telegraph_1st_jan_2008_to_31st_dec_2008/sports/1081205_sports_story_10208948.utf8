                                                                                                                                                                                                     United SC held 0-0
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Mumbai FC held local side United SC to a goalless draw in the second match of the 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Thursday evening. Although Subrata Bhattacharjees boys came close to scoring on several occasions they lacked the finishing touch.         
	After a 1-1 draw in the just-concluded first leg of the ONGC I-League, both the sides started on a defensive note. While Subrata Bhattacharjee had his two foreign recruits, Nigerians Louis Nigi Ebami and Bidemi Daniel Ayeni, doing a commendable job in defence, his strikers Sankar Oraon and Ayan Chowdhury lacked killer instinct.         
	The Mumbai men similarly lacked their I-League touch. An ambitious 13th minute header by Felix Aboagye, which went out of play, was the only notable move by them.         
	The resumption after the lemon break saw United SC change their gameplan. With M. Subhas Singh replacing Ayan Chowdhury in the 46th minute, United SC went all out for a win.Sankar had some opportunities but he failed to finish mainly due to the absence of any support from his colleagues.         
	In the 62nd a Snehasish Chakraborty cross from the left found Sankar in the right place. The striker, however, managed only a weak touch to put it out of play.         
	Unsettled by the attacking play of their opponents, Mumbai FC introduced fresh legs in defence  a move that saw them thwart some good United SC moves in the last 15 minutes.         
	A free-kick in the 68th minute by Louis Nigi Ebami saw Mumbai FC custodian Amit Singha Roy pull off a brilliant save. In the 78th minute, Abel Hammond missed a chance for Mumbai FC.         
	For Subrata Bhattacharjee, the last chance  what could be termed as a golden chance  of the match was squandered by substitute M. Subhas Singh.         
	We played a good match.. I am happy but it was hard luck for us... We missed some good chances, Bhattarcharjee said after the match.

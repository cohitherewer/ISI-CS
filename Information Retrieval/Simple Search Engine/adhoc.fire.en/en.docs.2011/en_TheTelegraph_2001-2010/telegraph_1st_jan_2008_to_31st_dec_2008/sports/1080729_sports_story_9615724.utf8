	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting leapfrogged Mohun Bagan to take the lead in the Sahara CFL Premier Division, by beating them 2-1 in a dramatic tie at the Salt Lake Stadium. The two sides were level till the 93rd minute before Bagans promising U-19 defender N. Mohan Raj scored an unfortunate own goal to decide the fate of the match.         
	Mohun Bagan went into the match high on confidence and holding the league lead by a single point over Mohammedan Sporting. But Shabbir Ali was boosted by the presence of Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday who shook off their injury woes to start on Monday.         
	Sunday carrying a thigh strain still managed to trouble Bagans defenders enough to score the first goal from a penalty, after being brought down by Peter Odafe in the 22nd minute. Shabbir Ali and Karim Bencharifa seemed to be thinking on similar lines, opting for single strikers in Sunday and Lalawmpuiya supported respectively by Mike Okoro and Jose Ramirez Barreto operating as withdrawn forwards for their sides.         
	 Mohammedan Sporting dominated proceedings in the first half with Prasanta Chakraborty winning the midfield duel against counterpart Lalkamal Bhowmick. It was Chakrabortys through ball for Sunday which led to the penalty incident after the Liberian went down to Odafes mistimed tackle.         
	Man-of-the-Match Sundays swaggering approach wrong footed Sangram Mukherjee, putting Mohammedan Sporting ahead. The black-and-white brigade could have doubled their lead at the stroke of halftime, but young right back Rajib Ghosh, unmarked at the back post failed to tap in Satyajit Boses cross from the left.Bencharifas boys came back strongly in the second half with wingers Lalramluaha and Malswamtluanga swapping flanks and right back Naveen Kumar who replaced Habibur Rahaman bombing forward at every opportunity. The equaliser came in the 57th minute after Barreto dodged past a Mohammedan Sporting defender and released Malswamtluanga down the right.         
	The wingers ball in to the box was tapped in by Lalawmpuiya with ease. Mohammedan Sporting custodian Naseem Akhter and defender Sheikh Azim who had an outstanding game, kept out Barreto and Lalawmpuiya as a buoyant Bagan side pressed for the winner. But the fast unfolding script took a dramatic turn in the dying moments with Mohun Bagan left back Mohan Raj having a horror moment.         
	The youngster, making his debut on Monday put the ball into his own net, past a hapless Sangram Mukherjee, while chasing down substitute Vimal Pariyar. Sunday had initially released the winger with a clever flick.

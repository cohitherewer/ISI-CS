                                                  Sri Lanka close in   on India
    Calcutta: Sri Lanka was breathing down India rsquo;s neck after a 2-1 series win over its Asian neighbours while South Africa retained its second place in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship after defeating England by an identical margin on Monday, says A Staff Reporter.
    Sri Lanka leapfrogged England into fourth place and is now just one ratings point behind third-placed India as the series result earned Mahela Jayawardena rsquo;s side five points but cost Anil Kumble rsquo;s men four ratings points, according to a release.
  Sri Lanka now sit on 108 ratings points after starting on 103 while India have slipped to 109 after entering the series on 113.
    As Sri Lanka will not play any more Tests until May next year, it will pin its hopes on Australia to put it ahead of India. Ricky Ponting rsquo;s side will travel to India in October for a four-Test series and if it wins the series 3-0, Kumble rsquo;s men will drop behind Jayawarden rsquo;s side by one ratings point. 
    However, if India beat Australia by a similar margin, it will leapfrog South Africa into second place on 118 ratings points and will trail Ricky Ponting rsquo;s side by just nine ratings points.
    India can further reduce that gap to seven points if they win the two-Test series against England in December. 
    THE RANKINGS
  Teams mdash; 1. Australia (138 points); 2. South Africa (116); 3. India (109); 4. Sri Lanka (108); 5. England (104); 6. Pakistan (100); 7. New Zealand (83); 8. West Indies (81); 9. Bangladesh (0).

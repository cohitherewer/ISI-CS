The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi, Knowles   in semis
                                                                                                                                                                                           Bhupathi, Knowles   in semis
                            
	New Haven: Mahesh Bhupathi remained well on course to his second successive Pilot Pen doubles title after the Indian ace and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles eased into the semi-final with a straight-set victory here.         
	Bhupathi, who clinched the doubles title with Ninad Zimonjic last year, and Knowles beat Americans Eric Butorac and Scott Lipsky 6-4, 6-4 to enter the semis of the hard-court event.         
	The second-seeded Indo-Bahamian pair will now be up against Italians Simone Bolelli and Andreas Seppi, who beat Spaniards Guillermo Garcia-Lopez and Fernando Verdasco 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (2-7), 13-11 in a cliff-hanger. Although a straight-set victory, it was hardly a cakewalk for Bhupathi and Knowles who were tested by their unseeded rivals.

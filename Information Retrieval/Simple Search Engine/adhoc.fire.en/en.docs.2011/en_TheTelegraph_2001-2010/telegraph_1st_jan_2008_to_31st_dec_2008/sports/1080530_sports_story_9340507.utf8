	Mumbai: A high-octane contest between two well-balanced sides is on the cards when table toppers Rajasthan Royals take on the confident Delhi DareDevils in the first semi-finals of the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Friday.         
	The two sides look evenly matched ahead of what promises to be a top-drawer stuff in front of a capacity crowd at the Wankhede Stadium.         
	The team that hold their nerves better grabbing chances that come their way would go through to the summit clash against the winners of the second semi-final, on Saturday, between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings.         
	The Shane Warne-led Rajasthan outfit, impregnable at home in Jaipur, had finished with only three losses from their 14 preliminary phase ties and have a 1-1 head-to-head record against the DareDevils, who got into the last four with seven wins and 15 points to their credit.         
	Both the teams have depended on their top-order to fire well and pile up a big total. But the middle orders of both the sides looked a bit under-prepared when chips were down. They would be keen to topple the top three rival batsmen cheaply to gain a big advantage.         
	And DareDevils skipper Virender Sehwag wants his players to execute the elaborate plans chalked out by the teams think-tank.         
	Our planning is complete for the match and now we have to execute those plans. Both sides are equally matched, Sehwag said.         
	With the Wankhede tracks helping the seamers with its lateral movement and extra bounce in the league matches, it is expected to play a bigger role on Friday too.         
	For Sehwag, with the track helping the bowlers in the first half of previous ties, winning the toss would induce the captains to put the other side in.         
	I have seen in previous matches that the ball does a bit in the first half of the match and in the second half batting is easier. Both teams have good bowlers and shot selection is important, Sehwag said.         
	The battle between Glen McGrath, with support from Sri Lankan Fervez Mahroof and Yo Mahesh, and Rajasthans successful openers Graeme Smith (416 runs) and Swapnil Asnodkar could be crucial to the games outcome. The same applies to the Sohail Tanvir-Shane Watson-Munaf Patel combination, who will be up against the marauding Delhi opening pair of Gautam Gambhir (523) and Sehwag (403), as well as another in-form batsman at number three, Shikhar Dhawan.         
	Rajasthan possess a better spin attack with Warne and Yusuf Pathan and Dinesh Salunkhe while Sehwag will have to depend on Amit Mishra, for the most part.         
	Delhi have had a sizeable break of five days going into the tie while Rajasthan, without a few key players including Warne, were outclassed by Kings XI Punjab on Wednesday.         
	It has been largely rain-free so far in Mumbai, barring light drizzles, but the prevailing humidity, however, is not only uncomfortable for the players but also an indicator that rains are around the corner. (PTI)

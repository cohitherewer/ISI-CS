                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ashraf: It was my job 
                      
	Karachi: Although embarrassed after his stinging email castigating the Pakistan team appeared in newspapers, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Nasim Ashraf defended shooting off the strongly-worded letter, saying it was his duty to point out the ills that plague the side.         
	Insisting that the email was not meant to demoralise the team, Ashraf said: As the board chairman, it is my job to point out some glaring mistakes that were obvious in the match and the mail was meant to lift up the spirits of the players.         
	Before leaving for Bangladesh to watch the final of the tri-series, Ashraf said team manager Talat Ali had responded and assured him that the team management was taking corrective measures to ensure the team play well on Saturday.         
	Meanwhile, according to Pakistan team sources, all is not well in the Pakistan team and even some players are questioning credentials of Lawson as an international coach.         
	If you were here in Dhaka you would clearly see there is a split in the team with seniors like Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf, Shahid Afridi forming their own group and keeping distance from the captain and coach, a source revealed.         
	Some of the players are not getting along with Lawson after his recent radio interview where he hit out directly at them and criticised them for their attitude and performances without taking any names, the source added.         
	It was also learnt that Lawson playing golf, instead of arranging a practice the day after Pakistans big defeat against India has also been played up in the Pakistani media.

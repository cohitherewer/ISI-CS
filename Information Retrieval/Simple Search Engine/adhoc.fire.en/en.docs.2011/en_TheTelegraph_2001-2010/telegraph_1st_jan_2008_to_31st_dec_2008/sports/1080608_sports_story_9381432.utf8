The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ana is queen of clay
                                                                                                                                                                                             Ana is queen of clay
    - Serb beats Safina in straight sets to claim maiden Grand Slam title                 Dinara Safina at Roland Garros on Saturday                           
	Paris: This time Ana Ivanovic was ready for the French Open final.         
	Showing no sign of the nerves that afflicted her a year ago, Ivanovic claimed her maiden Grand Slam title on Saturday when she beat Russian 13th seed Dinara Safina 6-4, 6-3 in the French Open final.         
	The 20-year-old Ivanovic became the first woman representing Serbia to win a major title.         
	Last years finalist Ivanovic, who will become world No.1 on Monday was too powerful for Marat Safins younger sister, sealing a straightforward victory after one hour 38 minutes.         
	This was amazing. I still didnt believe it could happen, Ivanovic said in a courtside interview.         
	I think we both played a nervous match, we both had lots of chance and I am just happy that I kept my composure at the end.         
	Last years final was a great learning experience for me, so I am just so thrilled.         
	Safina, who was playing her first Grand Slam final, added: It was a great experience, I hope I can come back here next year.         
	A shaky Ivanovic played in her first major final a year ago at Roland Garros and won only three games from Justine Henin. But against Safina she was as cool as the 65-degree weather, showing hardly a bead of perspiration even after sprinting corner to corner to retrieve shots.         
	With just-retired, four-time champion Justine Henin watching from the stands, the Serb pushed Safina far behind her baseline and the Russian found herself trailing 4-1 in the opening set.         
	Safina, however, pulled a break back in the sixth game then held serve to love under threatening skies.         
	In the eighth game, she rallied from 0-40, winning five points in a row to level the contest but the 20-year-old Serb went another break up.         
	After saving a break point with a flat forehand, Ivanovic bagged the set after 45 minutes on her second opportunity when Safina put a backhand long.         
	Ivanovic won a 26-stroke rally in the third game of the second set, taking the game on Safinas serve. She watched her opponent smash a racket on the red dirt and held serve.         
	Safina, who came from match point down in her fourth-round and quarter final matches against compatriots Maria Sharapova and Elena Dementieva, could not fight back this time, bowing out with a missed forehand.         
	After blowing kisses to the crowd, Ivanovic used a chair to climb into the stands and share hugs with family and friends.         
	The final was the third in the past five major tournaments for Ivanovic. She was the runner-up at this years Australian Open. The No. 13-seeded Safina was trying to join her brother, two-time Grand Slam champion Marat Safin, in winning a major title. Theyre the first sister and brother to reach a Grand Slam final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith: Challenge is to maintain level
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Smith: Challenge is to maintain level

	Melbourne: South Africa captain Graeme Smith has hailed his teams historic series triumph over Australia as the greatest moment in South African cricket.         
	Its got to be the best, he said. Its got to be the most incredible season South African cricket has ever had, particularly with the results that weve had. I dont think anyone would argue with that.         
	Obviously things have changed a little bit now. Its a real honour for us to sit here today knowing we are the first team in 16 years to come and be victorious on these shores, Smith said.         
	The balance of power is evening out in world cricket.         
	Credit to Australia, theyve dominated world cricket for a decade now and they obviously enjoyed their time. It doesnt mean that theyre going to be beaten in future tours or are going to be easy to beat.         
	I think the balance is going to be evened out a little bit more now. Maybe other teams are moving into other eras, who knows?         
	In 2008 South Africa won 11 of 15 Test matches  which included a series win over England in England and a draw in India  and suffered just two losses. The 27-year-old Smith said South Africa could do worse than try to emulate Australias decade-long dominance of cricket.         
	I think the challenge is to maintain the levels that weve played at. Thats something youve got to give Australia credit for. That they performed at that level for a decade or so was incredible, Smith said.         
	For us, its going to be an ongoing challenge to keep achieving these standards weve set ourselves. Hopefully we stay fit and keep progressing to the next level of our game.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting remained upbeat ahead of the Sydney Test and said his team would not give up the top ranking without a fight.         
	Weve dominated world cricket for a long period of time. Im still very positive and very sure with some of the young guys coming on that in a few years time that we can get back up there and be dominating world cricket again, he said. A lot of players in the team arent accustomed to losing Test matches let alone Test series. The gap between our best cricket and our worst cricket has been too big, and we have to make that smaller if we want to win the next Test and if we want to stay in that top group of Test-playing nations.         
	Ponting was also quick to point out that Australia remain on top of the rankings for now. At the moment were still No. 1, they have to beat us in Sydney to take that mantle from us, he said.         
	Thats the way that ranking system works but Im probably sure if you knocked on their door theyll say theyre the No. 1 team at the moment.         
	Ponting admitted Australia had been in winning positions in both Tests but when weve needed to put the last couple of nails in the coffin we havent been able to do that.         
	In fact weve been a long way from being able to do that. Thats the disappointing thing, he added.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

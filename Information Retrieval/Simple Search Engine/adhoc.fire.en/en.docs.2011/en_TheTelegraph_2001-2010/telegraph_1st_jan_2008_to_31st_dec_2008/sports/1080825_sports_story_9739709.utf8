The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It was doing a bit more in the evening: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                     It was doing a bit more in the evening: Dhoni
        A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Colombo: The strong batting line-up of Sri Lanka succumbed to an inspired opening bowling by the Indian pacers, for the second game in succession. But a captains knock of 76 by Indias Mahendra Singh Dhoni earned him the Man-of-the-Match award and a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. Dhonis counterpart Mahela Jayawardene played his part with a fighting 94 after the top-order collapse, but in vain. The Indian captain lauded the efforts of his fast bowlers and said the ball was moving around a bit more in the evening when the Sri Lankans batted.         
	The following is what both captains had to say in the post-match presentation ceremony:         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni: It was a good track to bat on In the evening it was doing a bit more than the afternoon. They showed the importance of a partnership, it almost took them to the end. Having a fifth bowler is a luxury. We have to make do with four bowlers but we have bowlers like Yuvraj, Raina and Virat, who can bowl. We needed one extra batsman and so I think we were 15-20 runs short. When you play a bowler short You need those extra runs. Since Sri Lanka has a colourful crowd, it becomes difficult to spot the ball in the night specially after it (ball) becomes a bit dirty. Getting the attention of the fielders in the deep is so difficult out there Its so noisy. Earlier, India had batsmen who could play till the end and I could go for big shots early. I am, however, happy that I still have strike rate of 90 though I would have been happier to have a strike rate of over hundred.         
	Mahela Jayawardene: Its not much fun when you lose a match I think we played quite a good game, made a couple of mistakes up front while we were batting and thats where we lost the game. It was spinning a bit but the wicket played really well. With the new ball, it seems to do a bit more under the lights If we kept wickets, we could have chased the target. Every batsman has highs and lows. The idea of playing Sangakkara as opener is to have some senior batsman to get more balls to play. India batted really well. Mahendra Singh Dhoni batted well, he batted through the innings. When they lost three wickets, we thought we could restrict them fewer than 200. Their fast bowlers bowled well up front once again. Its a challenging situation. Playing at home, we do not want to lose the series. We know where we are going wrong.

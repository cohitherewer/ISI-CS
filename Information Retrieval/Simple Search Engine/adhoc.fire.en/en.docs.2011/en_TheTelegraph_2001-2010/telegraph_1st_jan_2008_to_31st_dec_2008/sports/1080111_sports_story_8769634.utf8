    Clark blames TV analysts
 Melbourne: Stuart Clark believes repeated analyses and comments by the commentary team of the TV network airing the India-Australia matches have tarnished the hosts rsquo; reputation.
 The players are adamant that constant replays and discussions on sensitive topics such as claimed catches and walking have a major impact on the viewing audience. ldquo;I think some commentators need to understand the influence they have on the viewers, rdquo; paceman Clark said.
 Perth threat
 Adelaide: India are likely to face four fast bowlers in the fastest pitch in the world mdash; the Waca. The selectors are expected to give strong consideration to unleashing Shaun Tait as part of a four-pronged pace attack in Perth, where Lillee and Waca chief executive Graeme Wood confirmed that conditions would, like the fast and bouncy pitches of old, suit pace over spin.
 Same squad
 Sydney: Australia have named an unchanged squad for the third Test.
 THE SQUAD
 Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Phil Jaques, Michael Hussey, Michael Clarke, Andrew Symonds, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson, Stuart Clark, Shaun Tait
 Letter to Dave
 New Delhi: The Delhi Police want to ldquo;talk rdquo; to former South Africa cricketer Dave Richardson to help in investigations into the 2000 match-fixing scandal. ldquo;We have sent a letter rogatory to the South African government requesting it to allow us to question a number of players including Richardson, rdquo; additional commissioner of police (crime) Satyendra Garg said.
 Murali feted

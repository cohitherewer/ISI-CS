The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand shocked by Aronian
                                                   Anand shocked by Aronian
                      
	Morelia: World champion Viswanathan Anand had a bad day in office and lost to Levon Aronian of Armenia with white in the second round of the Morelia-Linares chess tournament here.         
	After a good effort with black pieces in Round I that earned him a victory over Alexei Shirov of Spain, Anand miscalculated in an intense middle game and went down after a fine attack by Aronian.         
	The Indian ace stayed on one point after the debacle and was relegated to joint third.         
	Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and former world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria were in joint lead on 1.5 points each after the former scored an emphatic victory over Hungarian Peter Leko while Topalov drew with Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan.         
	The other game of the day between Shirov and young gun Magnus Carlsen of Norway also ended in a draw.         
	With 12 rounds remaining in the unique double round robin tournament that is played first in Mexico and later in Linares, Spain, Anand dropped to joint third with Carlsen, Aronian and Leko. Radjabov and Shirov are at the bottom of the pile with half a point apiece.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ACC to honour Sunny, Imran 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ACC to honour Sunny, Imran

	Karachi: Two icons of sport, Sunil Gavaskar and Imran Khan, both former captains, will be honoured at the inaugural Asian Cricket Council (ACC) awards here on Saturday evening.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, both are likely to be presented the Legend of Asia award. Neither, however, will be around in person.         
	While Imran, who has just returned from overseas, is still barred from entering Karachi  the fallout of his stinging attack on the London-based MQM supremo Altaf Hussain  Gavaskar apparently is in the UK.         
	Gavaskar is saluted as one of the all-time great openers (the first batsman, incidentally, to get past 10,000 runs in Tests), while Imran is hailed as one of the most inspirational of cricketers. It was under his captaincy that Pakistan won the 1992 World Cup.         
	Other awards too will be presented  Muttiah Muralidharan, for example, is tipped to get one  but the ACC chose to be tight-lipped.

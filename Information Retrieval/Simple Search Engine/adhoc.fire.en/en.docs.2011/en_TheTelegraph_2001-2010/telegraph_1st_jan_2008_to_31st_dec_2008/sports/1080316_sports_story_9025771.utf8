            A STAFF REPORTER             Graeme Smith                           
	Calcutta: South Africa captain Graeme Smith has snatched top spot of the LG ICC Player Rankings for ODI batsmen from Indias Sachin Tendulkar after his performance in the series against Bangladesh.         
	According to an ICC release, Smith required a career-best rating to grab the coveted spot after starting the series on 753 points and in third place behind Tendulkar and Australias Ricky Ponting. However, his series effort of 199 runs not only won him the Player of the Series award but also earned him 39 ratings points which were enough for him to leapfrog his two closest rivals into top spot.         
	Smiths men have taken the top spot from Australia and they have also ensured they will top the table on April 1.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh are in the 10th and 17th places, respectively.

                                                   Sangwan shines in India win
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A five-wicket haul by Pradeep Sangwan helped India beat South Africa by six wickets in their Under-19 World Cup group B match at Kuala Lumpur Tuesday, according to an ICC release.         
	Sangwan ripped through South Africas top order and finished with five for 44, after the junior Proteas elected batting. They were restricted to 149 all out in just 30.5 overs.         
	India, in reply, riding Taruwar Kohlis half-century and Tanmay Srivastavas 47, reached the target in 42 overs.

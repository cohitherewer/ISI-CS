	Melbourne: The International Cricket Councils attempts at convincing jittery cricketers about the security situation in Pakistan seem to be hitting a dead end with Australia skipper Ricky Ponting saying that his teammates are still not sure about touring the strife-torn country for next months Champions Trophy.         
	As far as the players go, there has been some concern. There is no doubt about that. There has been concern for quite a while now, the Australian captain said after meeting ICC and security officials and Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson.         
	We, as a cricket team, are no different to any other Australian. I am sure everyday Australians that you would bump into in the street would have some concerns as well, but the good thing is we are a lot more informed now than we were before the day started, Ponting said.

                                                   Alonso test drives new car

           
	Valencia: Fernando Alonsos anticipated first drive in Renaults new car went ahead Monday despite a delay due to fog on the test track. 
    
	The two-time world champion, who had some of the quickest lap times at Formula One testing in Jerez, Spain, last week in Renaults 2007 car, spent two hours waiting out the blanket fog before finally getting out to take some cautious spins around the Cheste Circuit in the 2008 car. 
    
	Track organisers expect up to 20,000 fans to watch the Spaniard this week in his return to the French team from McLaren late last year. About 4,000 were in attendance Monday. 
    
	All 11 F1 teams will be on the track from Tuesday through Thursday. (AP)

	Santiago/New Delhi: Indias failure to qualify for the Beijing Olympics claimed its first victim with chief coach Joaquim Carvalho deciding to step down along with the support staff.         
	Faced with a do-or-die battle, Indias Beijing dream came crashing down as Barry Middleton (4th minute) and Richard Mantell (10th) scored for Britain in a nerve-wracking final in Santiago.         
	Eight-time gold medallist India thus failed to make it to the Olympics for the first time since their debut in 1928.         
	When I took over 11 months ago, I said I would resign if I cannot deliver. I am keeping my word, said Carvalho.         
	I am as disappointed and hurt as any other Indian. Having said that, failure to qualify for the Olympics is not the end of the road. We now have to start from scratch and renew our attempt to become one of the top teams, he said.         
	Carvalho said he was still to speak to Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill about his resignation but asserted that his decision was final.         
	On whether he would reconsider his decision, Carvalho said, I dont know. I will have to give everything a lot of thought. There are a few issues too that the IHF will first have to straighten out.         
	In any case, for the moment, I am firm in my decision to step down along with assistant coaches Mohinder Pal Singh and Ramesh Parameswaran, he said.         
	Meanwhile, technical advisor Ric Charlesworth said on Monday that he was not surprised by Indias failure and blamed Carvalho for sidelining him from the qualifier in Chile.         
	I am aware of the result Very disappointing but not a surprise I always said it was 50-50.         
	The plan was always for me to accompany the team but I remain stranded in Perth awaiting a ticket to return to India. I believe the coach did not want me to be involved and I could not convince Gill that it was important, Charlesworth said.

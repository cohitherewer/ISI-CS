The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hamilton stamps his class on a wet track
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hamilton stamps his class on a wet track
  - Nick Heidfeld, Rubens Barrichello finish second and third, respectively             Lewis Hamilton after his victory on Sunday                           
	Silverstone: McLarens Lewis Hamilton blew away his rivals to win a wet and chaotic British Grand Prix on Sunday and storm back to the top of the Formula One standings.         
	Hamilton, the first British winner at Silverstone since David Coulthard in 2000, was utterly dominant as he lapped all but second-placed Nick Heidfeld in a BMW Sauber and the Honda of Brazilian Rubens Barrichello.         
	The 23-year-olds third win of the season put him level on 48 points with Ferraris Brazilian Felipe Massa, who was 13th and last after spinning five times on the sodden track, and world champion Kimi Raikkonen.         
	To the delight of the home fans, Hamilton took the chequered flag a staggering 68.5 seconds ahead of Heidfeld, an age in Formula One terms.         
	Meanwhile, there seems simply no end to Force Indias misery, as the formula one outfit finished the race at the British Grand Prix on Sunday with another double retirement against its name.         
	Neither of the Force India cars could survive the tough, wet conditions at the rain-lashed Silverstone track. Adrian Sutil was the first to crash out after 10 laps.         
	In comparison, his Italian teammate Giancarlo Fisichella did slightly better to complete 26 laps before he too went for an excursion in the gravel to join his teammates in the sidelines.         
	Adding to the sense of astonishment, the evergreen Barrichello clambered on to the podium for the first time since 2005 to almost double Hondas season points tally.         
	In the most intense title battle in years, BMW Saubers Polish title contender Robert Kubica failed to finish but was still only two points behind the top trio at the halfway stage of the season.         
	Hamiltons seventh win in just 26 starts was the perfect riposte to the critics who had suggested he was feeling the pressure of fame and fortune after two error-laden races in Canada and France.         
	Its definitely by far the best victory Ive ever had, it was one of the toughest races Ive ever done, Hamilton said. When I was out there I was thinking this would definitely go down as the best race Ive ever won. I could see the crowd beginning to stand up and I was praying just keep it on the track, just finish. I just wanted to get it round.         
	Raikkonen, last years winner at Silverstone, finished fourth.         
	McLarens Heikki Kovalainen had a disappointing race after starting on pole for the first time and came home fifth ahead of Renaults double world champion Fernando Alonso.         
	Italian Jarno Trulli was seventh for Toyota with Kazuki Nakajima taking the final point for Williams.         
	Hamilton and Raikkonen pitted together at the end of lap 21, a stop that proved decisive for the Briton and devastating for the champion.         
	While Hamilton refuelled and switched to a fresh set of intermediates, Ferrari kept Raikkonen on his existing tyres in the mistaken expectation that the rain would ease off.         
	The two had been nose-to-tail leaving the pits but the McLaren driver vanished into the spray, lapping nearly five seconds quicker than Raikkonen to build up a lead of 29 seconds by lap 27.         
	With Raikkonen struggling, the BMW Saubers seized the chance with Heidfeld taking two Finns in one go as Kovalainen passed Raikkonen and left the door open for the German to sweep past both on lap 27.         
	Teammate Kubica passed Renaults Nelson Piquet, Raikkonen and Kovalainen in quick succession to move into third place.         
	The Poles hopes of regaining the championship lead evaporated 20 laps from the end when he spun into the gravel.         
	Red Bulls Coulthard retired from his last home appearance after skidding off without completing a lap.

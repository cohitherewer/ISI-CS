The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Too early to talk about 2011: BCCI
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Too early to talk about 2011: BCCI
                      
	New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Monday dismissed media reports that the sub-continent could lose the right to host the 2011 cricket World Cup because of continuous terror attacks, saying that the high-profile event was still a long way away.         
	It is still too early to talk about the 2011 World Cup being shifted from the sub-continent. It is too far-fetched. I dont think there will be any problem in holding the event, senior BCCI official Rajiv Shukla said.         
	All the security issues will be sorted out, I dont think that will be a problem at all, said Shukla, who is also the chairman of the BCCIs finance committee.         
	Media reports said the continuous terror attacks in the sub-continent have cast a shadow over the 2011 Cricket World Cup to be jointly hosted by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and that the ICC was contemplating keeping a stand-by venue for the event.

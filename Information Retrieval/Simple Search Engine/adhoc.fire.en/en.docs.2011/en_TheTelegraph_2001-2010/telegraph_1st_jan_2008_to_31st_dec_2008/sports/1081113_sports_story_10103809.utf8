            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Having already climbed to second place in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship following their 2-0 series win over Australia, India s one-day side now have the opportunity to do the same in the shorter format of the game.         
	Going into the seven match ODI series against England, beginning in Rajkot on Friday India have an opportunity of climbing to the second spot on the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Championship table if they win all seven matches in the series.         
	Currently at fifth place on 113 ratings points, India will gain seven points for a clean sweep of the series, that will take them to 120 points, which is one more than the team currently in second place, South Africa.         
	With a 4-3 series win India will move above New Zealand into fourth place and a series win of 5-2 or 6-1 will see them overtake Kevin Pietersens team and climb to the third position on the table.         
	Meanwhile, England also have the chance to go above the Proteas into second place in the ICC ODI Championship and would do so if they win the series 5-2 or better. But if they were to lose by the same margin or worse they would fall below the Black Caps into sixth position.

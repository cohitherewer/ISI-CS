    - I-League 
  -  Third win on the trot for Mumbai FC; Mahindra lose three in a row             OUR CORRESPONDENT              United SC rsquo;s Murithala Ali and Ayeni Bidemi Daniel during practice on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                            
	Mumbai: East Bengal have their task cut out when they take on Air India in their third round match of the I-League football at the Cooperage on Sunday.         
	The odds are stacked against the Calcutta outfit. Having registered a win and a loss in their previous two games, East Bengal would have liked to throw the kitchen-sink at their opponents. But the absence of key players  Sunil Chhetri, Surkumar Singh, Alvito DCunha and Edmilson  due to injury and illness may just stop them from doing so.         
	The last time they played at the venue in December, East Bengal ended on the losing side under Manoranjan Bhattacharjee.         
	It remains to be seen as to how much Stanley Rozario, who has taken over from Bhattacharjee, can inspire the Calcuttans.         
	Past is past. Our focus is on tomorrows match. My job is make the players focused on that, Rozario said on Saturday.         
	Certainly he was not underestimating the hosts, who have made a strong start, drawing both their away matches to Mohammedan Sporting and Mohun Bagan. I never talk in terms of favourites, strong or inferior. They (Air India) are strong opponents. Any team that snatches two away points must be, was how he put it.         
	East Bengals hopes then would rest on Rennedy Singh in the front and Nirmal Chhetri at the back, although Rozario, typically, would not reveal his cards.         
	Air India coach Bimal Ghosh revealed fitness concerns similar to that of their rivals on the eve of the match. Michael Tayo, (Hringsolal) Thomte and Soccor Velho are all sick. I dont know whether they will play tomorrow, Ghosh said. Besides, Samson Singh and Narender Meetei are also out with knee injuries, the coach said. Singh missed the match against Bagan while Meetei did not turn up for the training session on Saturday.         
	Yet, the teams confidence is so high after their showing against Mohammedan Sporting and Bagan that Ghosh was still able say with composure: Well, at Cooperage we have always done well. Any team does well at home, isnt it?         
	Air India drew 1-1 against the two Calcutta teams, but not before dominating major part of both the games before conceding a late goal.

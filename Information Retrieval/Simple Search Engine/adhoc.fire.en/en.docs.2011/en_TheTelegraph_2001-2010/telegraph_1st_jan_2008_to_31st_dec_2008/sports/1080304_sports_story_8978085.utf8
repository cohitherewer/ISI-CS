                                                   Clearance not a surprise for Bhajji

           
	Brisbane: Harbhajan Singh, who was accused by Australian media of making monkey gestures at fans at the SCG during Sundays first tri-series final, has rubbished the allegations and denied any wrongdoing. 
    
	When the Indian spinner, who was cleared by Jeff Crowe, was informed that official the broadcaster did not have any incriminating evidence to offer the Match Referee, the Indian spinner was not surprised. 
    
	Obviously they wouldnt have anything because I didnt do anything. Some of the verbal attacks, which the crowd was directing at me, were despicable. It crossed all limits of decency. But my word, as a professional cricketer, my entire focus was ensuring that we as a team did well in the match, he said on his arrival here on Monday. 
    
	The off-spinner was also accused of spitting time and again, apparently to taunt the hostile crowd. 
    
	When you have saliva in your mouth what do you do? said a visibly irritated Harbhajan. 
    
	One of the International Cricket Council and Cricket Australias regulations is to ensure that the crowd in a stadium does not cast any racial slur or make abusive gesture towards cricketers on the field. (PTI)

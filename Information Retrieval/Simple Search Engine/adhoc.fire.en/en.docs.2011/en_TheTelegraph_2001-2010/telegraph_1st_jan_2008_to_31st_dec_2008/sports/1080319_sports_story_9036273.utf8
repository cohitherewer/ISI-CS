The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A coach cant do it alone: Karim
                                                     A coach cant do it alone: Karim
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Karim                           
	New Delhi: Karim Bencherifa, who was appointed Mohun Bagan coach on Tuesday, wants Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto to be role models for the entire squad.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, the Moroccan coach said: Bhutia and Barreto are the two icons of Indian football at the moment. Except for Sunil Chhetri, I dont find any other Indian striker who can score so many goals in so many important matches.         
	Asked whether the two strikers would be able to sustain themselves through the season at the same pace, Bencherifa said: I feel they are more than just football players. Their role in Indian football is simply unquestionable.         
	I have seen both of them from close quarters and I know they are true professionals. The duo will be role models for the juniors including those who would be joining the club from the Tata Football Academy.         
	Bencherifa, who coached Churchill Brothers to the second spot in the inaugural I-League, thinks the Calcutta Premier League could be the ideal tournament for his team to prepare for the tougher battles ahead.         
	I dont believe that players get too tired at the end of the Calcutta League, the new Mohun Bagan coach said. It is not right to say that players in India are playing too many matches in a season.         
	Here a player may be playing a maximum of 60 matches in a season. In Europe players are involved in many more matches in a particular season. It is basically all about preparation. It is all about how a player handles himself and keeps himself fit throughout the season.         
	Bencherifa is fully aware that he is expected to deliver the results immediately. If I say that I am preparing a team for the next couple of years, I will be wrong. I shall do my best to produce results. But then the coach alone cannot bring the desired results. The players, officials, fans and the media have a role to play as well.         
	The 40-year-old coach said he was happy with the current set of players though he had specifically given the club officials a list of players who could be recruited from others clubs.         
	I cant name the players I want... After all, everything is in not my hand. Firstly, the players should be ready to play for the club. At the same time, it should be financially viable for the club too.

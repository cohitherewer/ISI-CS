	 Taupo: Narain Karthikeyan was unhurt in a crash and fought his way up from 20th place on the starting grid of the sprint race to guide A1 Team India to a 10th-spot finish in the format race on Sunday. Karthikeyans finish earned Team India a point, taking their total to 28, tied with A1 Team China. 
    
	In the feature race, Karthikeyan began well but ran into trouble on the first fatal lap when A1 Team Italy seemed to pull back. The cars collided and the Team India car spun out and was hit from behind by another team. This rendered his car undrivable.

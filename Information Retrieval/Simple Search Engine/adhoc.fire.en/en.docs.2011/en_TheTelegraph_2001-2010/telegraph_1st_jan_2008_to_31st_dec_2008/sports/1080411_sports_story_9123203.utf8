                                                                                                                                                                                                     Okoro seals it for Md. Sp.
                      
	Kolhapur: A splendid strike by Mike Okoro helped Mohammedan Sporting come from behind to seal a 2-1 win against group leaders Mumbai FC in a second division I-League match here on Thursday.         
	The game at the Shahu Chhatrapati Stadium lived up to the billing and the capacity crowd was treated to some quality football.         
	Aseem K drew first blood for Mumbai FC in the 15th minute, only to see Adebayo levelling the score a minute later. When the teams seemed destined to share points, Okoro came up with the winner with five minutes left on the clock.         
	The Mohammedan Sporting captain dribbled past a couple of defenders and found the net in a brilliant solo effort to seal victory for his team.         
	Both teams now have 12 points from five matches, but Mumbai FC lead the table on superior goal difference.           (PTI)

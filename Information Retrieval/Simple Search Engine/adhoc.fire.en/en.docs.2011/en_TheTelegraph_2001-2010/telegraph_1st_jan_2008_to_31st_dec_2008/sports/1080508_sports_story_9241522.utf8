The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting still a worry for Riders 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Batting still a worry for Riders 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Four straight losses are enough to shatter a teams morale but not when John Buchanan is in command.         
	Kolkata Knight Riders may be struggling to find their foothold in the Indian Premier League but the defeats have failed to dampen their spirits. The credit should go to the coach who has worked wonders on the mental aspect.  
	------------------------------------------------------------------  
	Mumbai Indians moved up to the fifth spot in standings after upsetting Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday. They now have six points from seven games. Kolkata Knight Riders have slipped to sixth with four points from six ties. Bangalore Royal Challengers remain at the bottom of the table  
	------------------------------------------------------------------  
	As Sourav Gangulys men get ready to take on Bangalore Royal Challengers, the goal is to start afresh and not look behind.         
	A victory will keep the hosts in the hunt for a semi-final berth and provide much-needed confidence for tougher tests ahead. They have four points from six matches.         
	The arrival of Shoaib Akhtar has also done its bit to boost the teams resolve but the Pakistani will not be playing on Thursday. He is still far from regaining match fitness and the teams think tank has decided not to risk him.         
	Batting remains Knight Riders biggest worry. Except for the first match when Brendon McCullum displayed some pyrotechnics, the batting has been mediocre at best. A flurry of wickets within the first five overs has led to the middle-order facing enormous pressure. Even a blistering 104-run partnership off 55 balls between David Hussey and Wriddhiman Saha was not enough to fetch victory in their last game.         
	Sourav acknowledged as much during the match-eve news conference. Its time for all of us to perform, said the captain.         
	Not surprisingly, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned side have rung in changes to boost their batting. Aakash Chopra, who is being seen more in the mould for the longer version game, is set to be included in the XI. He has to change his game a bit, Sourav remarked.         
	Salman Butt is likely to return and will open with Chopra. Sourav has wisely decided to drop himself down the order. The bowling, too, needs a dose of adrenaline. Ishant Sharmas 21 runs in the last over against Kings XI Punjab proved decisive in the end. The quick has proved to be inconsistent with his second spell and it would be wise to spend his quota at the start. Umar Gul, though, has impressed in the two matches thus far and has proved to be their best bet in the circumstances.         
	For Bangalore Royal Challengers, struggling at the bottom of the table with only two wins from seven games, troubles have been further compounded by internal bickerings. Chief executive Charu Sharma has been replaced by Brijesh Patel. To cap it all, Wasim Jaffer has fractured his finger and is unavailable. So the experimentation with their batting order will continue.         
	Rahul Dravid will have to once again lead the way. It is also important that Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Cameron White, Jacques Kallis and Dale Steyn do justice to their reputation. The visitors are in a crisis territory and a loss on Thursday will only complicate matters.

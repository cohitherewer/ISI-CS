            The European Championship was former Uefa general secretary   Henri Delaunay rsquo;s idea, and it was approved by a Uefa Congress in   1957 mdash; 2 years after his death. The trophy is named after him                      
	France 1960  
	The Soviet Union scored the first goal in the qualifying tournament for the inaugural European Championship, and then won the maiden title about two years later at Parc des Princes in Paris. 17 teams entered the qualifying tournament, which was called the European Nations Cup. After Czechoslovakia eliminated Ireland in a two-leg playoff, the Soviets beat visiting Hungary 3-1 in the first official match on September 28, 1958, with Anatoli Ilyin scoring the first goal in the fourth minute in front of more than 100,000 fans.  
	Not everyone was sold on the idea of the competition, however. Italy, West Germany and England all decided to skip the first tournament.         
	The Soviets, who advanced without playing Spain in the second round because Gen. Francisco Franco refused to allow them entry to his country, were led by goalkeeper Lev Yashin. They defeated Czechoslovakia 3-0 in the semi-finals at the Stade Velodrome in Marseille, and Yugoslavia ousted the hosts 5-4 at Parc des Princes. The first European Championship final was played on July 10, and the Soviets won in extra-time after getting a 114th-minute header from Viktor Ponedelnik.    
	spain 1964  
	Four years after refusing to play the Soviet Union, hosts Spain beat the defending champions 2-1 in the final. The Spanish advanced to the final by beating Hungary 2-1 in extra-time, while the Soviets defeated Denmark 3-0. In the final, Marcelino scored the winning goal in the 84th minute. Politics again played a role in the qualifiers, with Greece refusing to play Albania because it was officially at war with their neighbour.     
	Italy 1968  
	The first official European Championship final took place in 1968, with Italy getting their chance at the title because of a coin toss. The Italians eliminated the Soviet Union by the flip of a coin after a 0-0 draw through extra-time. Yugoslavia rsquo;s Dragan Daji was the highest scorer of the tournament with two goals, while Luigi Riva scored the fastest goal, in the 12th against Yugoslavia.    
	Belgium 1972  
	Gerd Mueller led West Germany to the title in 1972, scoring two goals in the semi-finals and two more in the 3-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. West Germany rsquo;s 3-0 win is still the largest margin of victory for a European Championship final. Besides Mueller's two goals, Herbert Wimmer also scored. The West Germans went on to win the World Cup two years later.     
	yugoslavia 1976  
	West Germany were the clear favourites heading into the 1976 tournament. Czechoslovakia, however, beat The Netherlands 3-1 in extra time in the semi-finals and then went through an additional 30 minutes again in the final against the West Germans before winning their only title 5-3 on penalties after a 2-2 draw. It was the first time the European title was decided on penalties.    
	italy 1980  
	The tournament expanded in 1980 with eight teams playing in Italy instead of the previous four. The hosts qualified automatically. West Germany won their second title, beating Belgium 2-1 in the final. Horst Hrubesch scored both goals for the German team, including an 88th-minute header. The expanded meet also allowed more top players to participate, including England forward Kevin Keegan, who was named European Player of the Year in 1978 and 1979.    
	france 1984  
	Michel Platini was the star at home in 1984, scoring nine goals in five games to give France their first major title. France beat Portugal 3-2 in extra time in the semi-finals. Platini scored the winning goal with one minute to go. In the other semi, Spain advanced by defeating Denmark 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw. Platini scored the opening goal in the final in the 57th minute to help give France the title in Paris with a 2-0 win over Spain.    
	W. germany 1988  
	A trio of AC Milan players led The Netherlands to their only major title in 1988. Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard combined to beat the Soviet Union 2-0 in the final. Gullit headed in the first goal in the final in Munich, but it was Van Basten's amazing volley off a cross from Arnold Muhren that remains the iconic image of the meet.     
	sweden 1992  
	Denmark failed to qualify for the 1992 tournament in Sweden, but were allowed to compete after Yugoslavia were kicked out because of UN sanctions. The Danes beat France 2-1 to reach the semi-finals. After getting past The Netherlands in a shoot-out, with Denmark goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel saving a penalty from Marco van Basten, they beat a unified Germany 2-0 in the final in Goteborg.     
	england 1996  
	The European Championship expanded to 16 teams in 1996, and it was the first tournament to be decided by a quot;Golden Goal quot;. The 15 teams that qualified for the tournament along with hosts England were split into four groups of four. The top two teams in each group advanced, adding a quarter final round. England were the favouritesbut couldn't get past Germany in the semis, losing 5-6 on penalties at Wembley after a 1-1 draw. The other semi-final match also ended 6-5 on penalties, with the Czech Republic beating France after a 0-0 draw. In the final at Wembley, Patrik Berger gave the Czechs a 1-0 lead from the penalty spot, but Oliver Bierhoff equalised in the 73rd and then scored the quot;Golden Goal quot; in the 95th.    
	Belgium - Netherland 2000  
	The first European Championship to be hosted by two countries ended in a second straight quot;Golden Goal quot;. With England and Germany both eliminated in the first round, World Cup champions France and Italy were the favourites heading into the quarter finals.The Italians reched the final by defeating the Dutch on penalty kicks and France rallying to beat Portugal 2-1 in extra-time on a 117th-minute quot;Golden Goal quot; penalty from Zinedine Zidane. Italy appeared to be on their way to another European title until Sylvain Wiltord scored a 90th-minute equaliser in the final in Rotterdam. David Trezeguet then knocked in the winning goal in the 103rd.    
	portugal 2004  
	Greece had never won a match in two previous major championships, but the team managed to beat hosts Portugal in both the opening and closing games of the 2004 tournament. With German veteran Otto Rehhagel as coach, the Greeks played defensively throughout the tournament, also beating France in the quarter finals and the Czech Republic in the semi-finals. Portugal seemed destined to win their first major title despite the opening loss, finishing first in the group with two wins and then beating England in the quarter finals and The Netherlands in the semi-finals.
  France, coming off a disappointing World Cup in which they were eliminated in the first round, started Euro 2004 with an amazing 2-1 win over England. Zinedine Zidane scored both goals in injury time, and both the English and French advanced to the quarter finals.

                                                   Dont fear playing in India, says Warne
                      
	 Melbourne: India and Australia may have gone at each other in one of the most acrimonious and volatile series in recent times, but spin legend Shane Warne does not expect any backlash when the Australians go to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the bilateral tour later this year. Every single time Ive been to India, the fans have been very good They love their cricket, Warne, captain and coach of the Jaipur franchise, said. Theres obviously a bit more of an aggressive approach from the Indians at the moment. Its good to have a couple of rivals, some competition from other international sides, the tweaker was quoted as saying in a local daily.  
	Cairns warning  
	 Wellington: Former New Zealand great Chris Cairns has warned the cricket establishment it faces a mass exodus of leading players if it does not accept the rebel indian cricket league (ICL). Cairns told a website that players cannot afford to ignore the lucrative salaries on offer. The ICC are going to have to fix this, Cairns said, calling for players to be able to play in the ICL and not be banned.  
	Emburey coach  
	 London: John Emburey, the former England spin bowler who left his job as Middlesexs director of cricket last month, has been appointed to coach one of the two new franchises in the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL). Emburey has signed a three-year contract with the Ahmedabad Rockets, who will be captained by Damien Martyn, the former Australia batsman, and include Murray Goodwin, the Sussex and Zimbabwe batsman, Wavell Hinds, of Derbyshire and West Indies, and Jason Gillespie.  
	Gayle to lead  
	 Miami: Jamaican Chris Gayle has been appointed captain of West Indies for the forthcoming series against Sri Lanka, the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) said on Wednesday. The hard-hitting opening batsman stood in for injured captain Ramnaresh Sarwan during a triumphant one-day series against England and then led the team to their first Test win in South Africa. With Sarwan having recovered from his ankle injury and expected to be back in the squad for the two Tests against the Sri Lankans, the WICB had a tricky choice to make.  
	MacGill pledge  
	 Sydney: Leg-spinner Stuart MacGill has pledged that he will be selected for Australias tour of the West Indies in May. MacGill, who has been recovering from surgery on his right bowling wrist, is due to make his first-class return for New South Wales later this week.  
	BCB move  
	 Chittagong: Bangladesh have asked retired left-arm spinner Mohammed Rafique to explain why he took a swipe at cricket board officials before his final Test against South Africa last week. Rafique, the most successful Bangladesh bowler in Tests and ODIs, lashed out at officials of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) saying they had forced him to quit. Bringing such unsubstantiated allegations against any official is a clear breach of the code of conduct, BCB officia; Gazi Ashraf Hossain said on Thursday.

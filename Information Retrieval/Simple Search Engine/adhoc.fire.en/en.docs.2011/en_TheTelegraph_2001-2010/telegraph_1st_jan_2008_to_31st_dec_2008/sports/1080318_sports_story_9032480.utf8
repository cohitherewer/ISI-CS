                                                     Bravo fit to take on Lanka
                  Bravo                     
	Port of Spain: Dwayne Bravo has been cleared to play for the West Indies in the first Test against Sri Lanka starting on Saturday in Guyana.         
	Bravo was sidelined with a discomfort in his back for the sixth round of matches in the West Indies first-class championship when his native Trinidad and Tobago faced the Combined Campuses and Colleges.         
	I felt a little soreness in the lower back last week and missed the match to get some rest and allow for the stiffness to go away, he said.         
	It has now gone and I am training at the Queens Park Oval and also in the gym. Bravo is looking forward to series, and noted it was important for the West Indies to make a strong start to the series in Guyana.         
	Far too many times have we been caught in a position where we are playing catch-up cricket, he said.         
	We need to go out there Be positive and give it our best shot in the opening match of the tournament.         
	Bravo expects Sri Lanka to offer a stiff challenge, especially their off-spin bowling legend Muttiah Muralidharan. Sri Lanka are a very good outfit and they are coming here to win, he said.

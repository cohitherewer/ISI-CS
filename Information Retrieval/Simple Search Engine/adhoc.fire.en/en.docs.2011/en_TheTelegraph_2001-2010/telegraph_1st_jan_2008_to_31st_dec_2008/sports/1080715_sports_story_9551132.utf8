	Chennai: Team India coach Gary Kirsten said getting an eight-day build-up time for the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka is a welcome relief as it would allow players to balance practice and rest.         
	Kirsten said that after six months of almost non-stop cricket, players were relieved to get a short-break ahead of the three-match Test series against Sri Lanka.         
	The Indians will land in Colombo on Tuesday and will play a three-day practice match against Sri Lanka Board XI from Friday.         
	Everyone is fine. That is important, Kirsten said.         
	As Anil (Kumble) says we had eight days of preparation before we take to the Test match. This is ample time for an important Test series, he said.         
	On the criticism about Indians dont spend enough time in the nets, Kirsten retorted that the team knows what needs to be done.         
	There seems to be lot of talk about we do not practice much. But the team practices according to the demands. There is a fine balance between the players resting and practicing. There is a great amount of balance in this area, he said.         
	Talking about the Test series, Kirsten said batting remains the teams strength but the bowling has also improved with seamers like Ishant Sharma performing consistently.         
	I think we got four or five talented seam bowlers on this Sri Lankan tour. Zaheer is an experienced bowler and bowls well in sub-continent conditions.         
	Ishant (Sharma) and others are in form. I am very happy about what we have got for the tour. We have the choice of quality attack around for our matches. Happy at the moment, he said.

	Leeds: Andrew Flintoff will bat at number seven in his first Test match for 18 months when England face South Africa at Headingley in the second Test on Friday.         
	Captain Michael Vaughan told a news conference on Thursday that Paul Collingwood would make way for Flintoff with wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose, whose recent international form has been poor, promoted to number six.         
	Opening bowler Ryan Sidebottom, who was afflicted by a side strain in the first Test at Lords that ended in a draw on Monday, will undergo a fitness test on Friday.         
	Chris Tremlett has been recalled to the squad as cover and Nottinghamshire pace bowler Darren Pattinson has been placed on standby for James Anderson who is also suffering from a sore back.         
	Vaughan said he always considered Flintoff was a number seven, even though he enjoyed a successful series at number six in Englands 2005 Ashes triumph.         
	His style of play is attacking and given the chance he can take the game away from an opposition, Vaughan said. Hes happy there and feels comfortable and hopefully it will take some pressure off him and allow him to express himself.         
	Vaughan said he was proud to be playing his 50th Test as captain. Its a huge honour, Vaughan said.         
	South Africa are assessing the fitness of opener Neil McKenzie, who sustained a groin strain while scoring a second innings century in the first Test.         
	Teams         
	England (likely): Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Michael Vaughan (captain), Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Tim Ambrose, Andrew Flintoff, Stuart Broad, Ryan Sidebottom, Monty Panesar, James Anderson.         
	South Africa (likely): Graeme Smith (captain), Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Ashwell Prince, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher, Paul Harris, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini.

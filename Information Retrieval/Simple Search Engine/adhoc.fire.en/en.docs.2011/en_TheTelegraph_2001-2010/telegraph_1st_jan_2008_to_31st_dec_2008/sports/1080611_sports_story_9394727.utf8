	Berne: Netherlands romped to a stunning 3-0 win over world champions Italy in the first clash of the heavyweights at Euro 2008 in the Stade de Suisse on Monday.         
	A controversial goal from Ruud van Nistelrooy, a superbly executed volley by birthday boy Wesley Sneijder and a breakaway third from the head of Giovanni van Bronckhorst late in the game produced the first major upset of this years finals.         
	To win 3-0 against Italy, a team with so much experience and qualityWe didnt expect that, said Netherlands coach Marco van Basten. It was a truly good performance from the whole team.         
	The win was the first by the Dutch over Italy since the 1978 World Cup finals and put them top of group C after France and Romania drew 0-0 in the days first game in Zurich.         
	It was the biggest margin of victory by Netherlands over Italy as they consigned their devastated opponents to their worst loss at European Championship finals.         
	Italys shocked coach Roberto Donadoni, who had presided over their heaviest tournament defeat since the 4-1 loss to Brazil in the 1970 World Cup final, just wanted to look ahead.         
	I dont want to say that its the worst Italy performance of my time in charge, he said.         
	Italy had chances and Luca Toni should have given them the lead after 12 minutes but headed wide, while Antonio Di Natales shot was smothered by Edwin van der Sar before the break. They must now improve quickly if they are to reach the last eight.

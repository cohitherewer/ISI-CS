	Mumbai: England will put aside memories of last weeks humiliating Stanford Twenty20 $20 million challenge defeat as they prepare for a tough one-day and Test series in India, skipper Kevin Pietersen said on Friday.         
	This series is going to be very tough, he told a news conference. India are playing fantastic cricket right now and it is tough beating India in India.         
	Weve been playing good cricket as well, we beat South Africa 4-0. Were obviously looking to improve.         
	The batsman, on his first full tour as captain after taking over from Michael Vaughan during the home series against South Africa in August, said England were not thinking about gaining experience for the 2011 one-day World Cup to be played in the sub-continent.         
	My thoughts are on this series, he said.(The World Cup) is so far away its not in my thoughts right now.         
	Left-arm paceman Ryan Sidebottom is nursing a calf problem and his recovery was being assessed, a team spokesman said.         
	England coach Peter Moores urged his players to adapt quickly.         
	Indias battings always been strong and it is a real challenge playing here given the difficult conditions, he said.

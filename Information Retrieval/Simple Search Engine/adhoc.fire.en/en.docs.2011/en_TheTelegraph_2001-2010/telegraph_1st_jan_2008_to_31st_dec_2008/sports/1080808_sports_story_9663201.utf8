The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rookie Kohli gets a call-up
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rookie Kohli gets a call-up
  - Ishant rested for ODIs in Lanka       A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Virat Kohli, who led India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup earlier this year, is the only rookie in the squad for the ODIs against Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy.         
	Ishant Sharma has been rested for the ODIs in Sri Lankaand will return for the Champions Trophy.         
	Dilip Vengsarkar, chairman of selectors, strongly pitched for Kohli after watching him during the Emerging Players meet in Australia recently. The selection meeting was held in Mumbai.         
	Significantly, The Telegraph had reported that Kohli was a contender for the berth occupied by Yusuf Pathan during the tri-series in Dhaka and the Asia Cup in Pakistan. As also reported, Parthiv Patel was included as the 16th member for the five ODIs in Lanka.         
	Ishant will be back in the 15-member squad for the Champions Trophy with Parthiv and Munaf Patel missing out. Resting the young Ishant came as a surprise since it would have made more sense to rest someone like Zaheer Khan.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni returns to take charge of the team after pulling out of the ongoing Test series. Sachin Tendulkar will also make a comeback as expected.         
	Zaheer is back after a nine-month absence, having last played for India during their home ODIs against Pakistan in November. Sachin returns after missing the Dhaka tri-series and the Asia Cup to recover from a groin injury.         
	Robin Uthappa, who has been in indifferent form, has been dropped along with Piyush Chawla, Manpreet Singh Gony and Yusuf Pathan. The selectors also decided against including Sreesanth. Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary, Niranjan Shah, said that the pacer needed to prove himself in domestic cricket, before being considered for selection.         
	Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh reclaimed his place in the side after serving out the five-match ODI ban.   
	KOHLI FACTFILE  
	Virat Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi in the 2006-07 Ranji Trophy and in January 2008 was named captain of the Indian Under-19 squad for the World Cup in Kuala Lumpur. An attacking batsman in the mould of Virender Sehwag, Kohli finished the tournament with 235 runs at 42.16. Having led Indias unbeaten run in the tournament, he became the second Indian captain to bring home the U-19 World Cup.  
	Kohli, who is also very mobile on the field, has scored a total of 630 first-class runs, which includes two centuries and a 50. The dashing right-hander, who played for the Bangalore Royal Challengers during the inaugural Indian Premier League, performed below par. But he became the second-highest run-getter for India in the recently concluded Emerging Players Tournament in Australia mdash; 204 runs in five matches at 51.00.  
	He was rewarded for his hard work on Thursday when the national selectors picked him for the one-day squad in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.

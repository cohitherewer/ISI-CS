The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 2 in a row for Alonso
                                                                                                                                                                                                       2 in a row for Alonso
  - Lewis Hamilton ends empty-handed       Simon Arron            Fernando Alonso after his victory on Sunday                                 
	There was no repeat of the rain that blighted last seasons corresponding fixture, but the race was no less chaotic. Hamilton made a poor start from pole position and allowed defending champion Kimi Raikkonen to get ahead before the first turn. Hamilton immediately tried to retaliate, but braked too late for the first corner and ran wide, taking Raikkonen and several others with him.         
	From sixth and fifth on the grid, Robert Kubica and Fernando Alonso swept into the first two positions, ahead of Heikki Kovalainen, Jarno Trulli, Felipe Massa, Hamilton and Rikknen.         
	Massa, Hamiltons closest title rival, made a mistake on lap two and ran wide at the chicane. Hamilton immediately dived inside the Brazilian, who tried to fight back as he bobbled over the kerbs.         
	The two cars collided as they exited the corner and Hamiltons McLaren spun around. Massa was subsequently awarded a drive-through penalty  but Hamilton got one, too, for his part in the initial incident at the first corner.         
	Hamilton pitted for fresh tyres after his clash with Massa and adjusted his strategy, but without the intervention of a Safety Car he was condemned to run towards the tail of the field for the balance of the afternoon.         
	Kubica and Alonso made their first scheduled stops on laps 17 and 18, respectively  and the Spaniard edged ahead in the process. He was subsequently able to control the pace and went on to record the 21st victory of his F1 career  and the second in as many races.         
	Kubica survived a late assault from Rikknen to finish second and keep his slender title hopes alive. He trails Hamilton by 12 points with two races to go, but Raikkonen is now out of the championship reckoning.         
	Alonsos Renault teammate Nelson Piquet drove the finest race of his F1 career to take fourth: it isnt his best result, but his second place in Germany was a product of good fortune. This one was down to consistent speed.         
	Trulli took fifth from Sbastien Bourdais, but the Frenchman was later penalised for his part in a collision with the recovering Massa. They arrived at the first corner side by side, moments after Bourdais had left the pits. Massa turned in and the two cars collided, causing the Ferrari to spin.         
	Stewards blamed the Frenchman and handed him a 25s time penalty at the end of the race. He dropped to 10th and Massa was promoted from eighth to seventh. Massa thus scored two points rather than one and has closed to within five of Hamilton.

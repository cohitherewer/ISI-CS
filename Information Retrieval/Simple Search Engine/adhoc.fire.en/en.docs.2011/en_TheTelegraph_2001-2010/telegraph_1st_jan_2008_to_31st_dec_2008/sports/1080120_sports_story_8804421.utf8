	Calcutta: Australias woes at losing the third Test on Saturday were compounded further when they were fined for slow over-rate. 
    
	According to an ICC release, Match referee Mike Procter imposed the fine after Ricky Pontings side was ruled to be two overs short of their target when time allowances were taken into consideration. 
    
	Each of the Australian players was fined 10 per cent of his match fee while captain Ponting was fined 20 per cent, in accordance with the ICCs code of conduct rules.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB chief files suit against Shoaib
                                                                                                                                                                                                       PCB chief files suit against Shoaib
                  Shoaib                     
	Karachi: Banned pacer Shoaib Akhtars never-ending woes have been compounded further with Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf Friday slapping a Rs 220 million defamation suit against him.         
	Tafazzul Rizvi, the legal counsel for Ashraf, filed the suit in a civil court in Lahore headed by judge Hina Muzaffar. The court will begin hearing the case from Saturday.         
	The defamation suit has been filed against Shoaib for making allegations on a television show that the PCB chairman had demanded money from him and other players for allowing them to sign contracts with the lucrative Indian Premier League.         
	Shoaib later retracted his claims and also made an unconditional apology before the appellate tribunal hearing his appeal against the five-year ban imposed on him by the disciplinary committee of the board.         
	Shoaib apologised for causing grief and pain in particular to the chairman of the board with the unsubstantiated and damaging allegations against him.         
	Meanwhile, chairman of the tribunal hearing Shoaibs appeal against his five-year ban has asked the PCB to explain why it has been making statements on whether the pacer would play in the IPL despite the matter being sub-judice.         
	Justice (retd) Aftab Farrukh said he has taken notice of some news items appearing in the media.         
	I as chairman and not the tribunal have asked for explanation. When they reply and I find that they have gone out of the parameter, then I will place it before the tribunal, Farrukh said.

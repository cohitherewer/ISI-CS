                                                                                                                                                                                                     Good toss to lose: Mahela
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dambulla: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said the Dambulla wicket wasnt an easy wicket to bat on and he was lucky to lose the toss on the wicket.         
	The following are excerpts:         
	A very comfortable victory in the first ODI of the series         
	When we started the game we didnt expect it to be like this but I will take it. Its important that when you start a five-match series you start well. I thought we bowled pretty well in the right areas and kept a lot of pressure on the Indian batsmen and created opportunities. It wasnt an easy wicket. Even when we were batting it wasnt easy, but we managed to get through which is most important.         
	Whether losing the toss turned out to be a blessing         
	Looks like it. I would have still batted knowing the first 45 minutes is tough. If they had got through that period and got 225 on the board it would have been a much tougher score to chase down than this. With the new ball its always going to do a bit. These wickets are like that, theres bit of bounce in it and probably a bit of juice in maximum the first eight overs and after that there was bit of seam movement. And there was seam movement when we were batting as well. It was a very good one-day wicket.         
	If he is happy with the start to the series         
	Im happy with the start we have got, but its just a start, we have got four more games yet. We have to make sure we concentrate very well and there are areas where we can improve and make sure we pinpoint that and work hard. Its not just about this series. We need to keep working hard for us as a group to improve.         
	If he is expecting India to come back strongly         
	Definitely, they will come back strongly. They have a very good side and they have a lot of talented individual players who can change the match for them.

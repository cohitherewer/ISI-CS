                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ball in Indias court: Lorgat
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Haroon Lorgat said that it cannot force member countries to tour Pakistan. Lorgat is here to show solidarity with England and India for their decision to resume the Test series following the Mumbai terror attacks.         
	We would try and encourage India to tour Pakistan ensuring that the right security is in place. But if the government decides not to allow the tour to go ahead, we have got to respect that decision. There is nothing ICC can do about it, Lorgat said.         
	He, however, said the teams could look at playing at a neutral venue, an option Pakistan is toying with. Given the excellent facilities available in Dubai and Abu Dhabi they should try and make use of them.         
	Responding to Pakistans accusation that ICC member countries adopted double standards when it came to touring there Lorgat said: The context is very different here. The ICC went to great lengths to assure security but the Champions Trophy is a multi-nation event. Some members took a different view and you have to respect it. It is a different decision what England has taken by agreeing to return after assessing the security issuesThis is a bilateral series and you cant compare the two.         
	Lorgat described Englands decision to return to India as brave. Its a good day for cricket, he said.         
	On the 2011 World Cup he said: Theres still a long way to go. Were going ahead with it as of now. We will assess the situation once the tournament draws close.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wen-Chong leads, Ashok tied 3rd                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wen-Chong leads, Ashok tied 3rd               OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Liang Wen-Chong at the Delhi Golf Club on Friday. (AFP)                                 
	New Delhi: Overnight leader Liang Wen-Chong continued to dominate at the end of the second round of the $1 million Hero Honda Indian Open golf at the Delhi Golf Club on Friday. Local stars Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh, however, barely managed to find their feet.         
	The Chinese star, who shot a course-record 12-under 60 on Thursday, had a one-under 71 in the second round with five birdies. Liangs 13-under 131 kept him five shots clear of second placed Daniel Chopra of Sweden, who had a two-under 70 on Friday for an overall 136.         
	Among the Indians, an unassuming Ashok Kumar turned out to be the unlikely hero as he and Australias Adam Blyth posted matching 67s to lie in joint third spot alongside Taiwans Lu Wen-teh, who carded a 71 for a 137 total in the prestigious Asian Tour event.         
	Jeev, the highest ranked player here, slipped to a tie for the 17th place after a 74, while defending champion Randhawa shot a 69 and was jointly placed 48th.         
	I had a great start with two birdies but then I lost some confidence in my putting. I missed a short four-putt on the fourth and then the putting was not the same. I kept hanging in there, said Jeev.         
	Calcuttas S.S.P. Chowrasia, who set the DGC course ablaze with a stunning victory in the Indian Masters in February, had a poor day as he missed the cut.         
	His even par 72 was not good enough to make up for Thursdays two-over 74.         
	I tried my best but my injury proved to be the biggest hindrance, Chowrasia said. Had I been fully fit, I would have done much better.         
	Liang, who continued to lead for the second consecutive day, said: I had a good start on the front nine with four birdies but lost my concentration on the back-nine. There are still two more days to go I have to keep it steady. I will head out and practice my short game and putting. This course is not easy and I can easily land myself in trouble.         
	There are still two more days to go so I have to keep it steady. There are a lot of good players here like Jeev and Daniel who can catch up so I hope to do my best over the weekend, he added.

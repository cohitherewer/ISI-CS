The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vasco shock for Mohun Bagan
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vasco shock for Mohun Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER            Agnelo Colaco after the match against Mohun Bagan at the Barasat Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: An Agnelo Colaco beauty in the second-half helped Vasco SC stun Mohun Bagan 1-0 and open up group D in the 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium Sunday.         
	In the early match of the day, a Michael Tayo goal in the dying minutes enabled Air India hold qualifiers Oil India 1-1. The two surprising results have turned group D into the group of death with leaders Air India, on four points, and Mohun Bagan and Vasco, on three each, all with a chance of making the final-four.         
	In the last set of group D matches, Vasco will take on Oil India (already out of contention) while Mohun Bagan face Air India on Tuesday to determine the semi-finalist.         
	The day simply did not belong to the Calcutta giants, currently placed at No. 2 in the I-League standings. The first half saw lapses by Mohun Bagans mid-field with their players lacking co-ordination. They did have a few chances but P.C. Lalawmpuiya, Ishfaq Ahmed and Marcos Pereira failed to find the target. Clearly, Mohun Bagan were missing their Brazilian ace Jose Ramirez Barreto, who started on the bench.         
	A desperate Karim Bencharifa replaced Lalawmpuiya with the injured Barreto in the 56th minute, but the Brazilian could hardly make any difference.         
	In the 68th minute, the rebound off a Pereira free kick that hit the crossbar fell to Bhaichung who met it with a rising header. The goalbound ball unfortunately took a deflection off Habibur Rehman Mondal and Bagan had yet again failed to score.         
	Eleven minutes later, Colaco stunned Mohun Bagan with a powerful shot that left Bagan goalie Sangram Mukherjee with no chance.         
	Credit goes to the Vasco goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani who stood out with some brilliant saves. In fact, the youngster gave an all-out show which took the Mohun Bagan forwards by surprise.         
	In the four minutes of time added on, Mohun Bagan had a chance to equalise but Bhaichung failed to connect.         
	Earlier in the day, Michael Tayo scored in the dying minutes to help Air India hold Oil India as the Assam qualifiers yet again produced a brilliant performance.         
	The Duliajan side impressed with their spirited show against Air India who are fourth in the I-League standings.         
	Had it not been for their inexperience and a nervous substitute goalkeeper who came on in the 78th minute, Oil India almost looked to upset the Mumbai side.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra, Churchill split points 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Mahindra, Churchill split points 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Steven Dias                           
	Calcutta: Mahindra United wasted an array of chances to be held 2-2 by Churchill Brothers in an exciting Federation Cup Group B match at the Barasat Stadium on Monday.         
	Sushil Kumar Singh scored the opening goal to put Mahindra in lead. Bineesh Balan scored the equaliser for Churchill before Okolie Odafe scored from the spot just before half-time. The Goa-side went into the lemon break 2-1 ahead.         
	Mahindra came back strongly in the second-half. Steven Dias restored parity with a curling free-kick from the right of top box.         
	Mahindra went into the lead in the 12th minute of the match. N.P. Pradeep made a good run down the centre and his cross reached an unmarked Sushil, after a deflection. The forward made no mistake from the top of the six-yard box.         
	Churchills equaliser came from a well-stitched move. Khan Thang Paite made a scorching run down the left and sent a measured cross for Odafe, who set up Balan brilliantly. Balans grounder from outside the box was too good for goalkeeper Subhasish Roy Chowdhury.         
	Sushanth Mathews tackle from behind on Odafe in the 43rd minute earned Churchill a penalty. Odafe calmly shot home to put Churchill 2-1 ahead.         
	National coach Bob Houghton , who was present at the ground, would have been mightily pleased with the free-kick from Steven Dias in the 48th minute. Dias aimed for the first post and curled it around the wall from the top of the box.         
	After Mondays draw, both teams are on four points from two matches. Teams         
	Mahindra United: Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, Lamine Tamba, Ravanan Dharamraj, Sukhwinder Singh, Sushanth Mathew, Steven Dias (K. Thoi Singh 68), N.P. Pradeep, Edeh Chidi, Mohammed Rafi, Manjit Singh (Sunil Kumar 78), Sushil Kumar Singh (Debabrata Roy 30).

	Inconsequential ties

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pollock on mcc committee
                                                                                                                                                                                           Pollock on MCC committee
            CRICKET BRIEFS                      
	 Mumbai: Shaun Pollock has been appointed as the newest member of the Marylebone Cricket Clubs World Cricket Committee.         
	Indias Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble will miss a meeting of the MCC next week due to commitments with the ongoing IPL. Pollock and former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe will also miss the meeting Monday and Tuesday.         
	THE MEMBERS  Tony Lewis (chairman), Mike Atherton, Mike Brearley, Geoffrey Boycott, Mike Gatting, David Shepherd, Alec Stewart (all England); Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid (both India); Shaun Pollock and Barry Richards (both South Africa); Tony Dodemaide and Steve Waugh (both Australia); Martin Crowe (New Zealand), Andy Flower (Zimbabwe), Majid Khan (Pakistan), Michael Tissera (Sri Lanka) and Courtney Walsh (West Indies).  
	Lord rsquo;s for floodlights  
	 London: The MCC wants to install temporary floodlights at Lords for the next five years. The MCC has said it had applied to Westminster City Council to get permission to use six temporary floodlights, starting in 2009. Lords needs to have floodlights to meet the criteria as a venue for next years Twenty20 World Cup.         
	Floodlights are now a key component for staging one-day and Twenty20 matches, MCC chief executive Keith Bradshaw said. This application provides a solution to floodlighting for the ICC World Twenty20 in 2009, a major international sporting event, as well as matches over the next five years. As the home of cricket globally, it is crucial that Lords continues to host these games.  
	Steve Waugh approval  
	 Melbourne: Former Australian skipper Steve Waugh has cautiously welcomed the ICCs plan to allow players the right to challenge umpiring decisions in Tests. The world governing body announced Wednesday an umpire review system would be trialled in a Test series this year, possibly between England and South Africa, starting in July.         
	Modern-day sport is moving more and more in this direction and if it works it will be great, Waugh said. If it doesnt detract too much from the game and the right decisions are given, it can only be a good thing.   
	Bangladesh tour of South Africa  
	 Calcutta: Bangladesh have been granted two Tests and three ODIs on their tour of South Africa in November. They will start with a Pro20 international at the Wanderers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haydens wicket was crucial, says Sehwag
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Haydens wicket was crucial, says Sehwag
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Virender Sehwag on Friday said it would not be easy for the Australians to save the third Test match at the Kotla.         
	Speaking to the media at the end of the third day, Sehwag said: I cant say it for sure but it is definitely getting difficult to bat on the Kotla wicket at the moment. Now the ball is spinning only on the periphery of the wicket. As it will start to spin on the pitch, it wont be easy to bat.         
	The part-time spinner, who captured three crucial Australian wickets, said the one-match ban on Gautam Gambhir was bit harsh.         
	They could have let him off with a fine, he said.         
	The following are excerpts         
	Q How do you feel after taking three wickets?         
	A After our captain left the field, someone had to step in. So I took the responsibility. My role was to restrict the batsmen but I got some turn from the pitch. It was after a long time that I bowled more than 20 overs.         
	Will you be able to dismiss Australia early on the fourth day?         
	I cant say it for sure but it is definitely getting difficult to bat on the Kotla wicket at the moment. Now the ball is spinning only on the periphery of the wicket. As it will start to spin on the pitch, it wont be easy to bat.         
	When would you like to get them out?         
	At the earliest.         
	Are you feeling the absence of Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble?         
	Yes, certainly. Unfortunately those two are not there. Otherwise, Australia would have been all out by now.         
	How much lead do you expect to get in the first innings?         
	We would love to have a lead of 200 runs and when they bat on the fifth day, it will be very difficult for them to survive the last two sessions.         
	Do you think India have an advantage?         
	The match is not in anyones favour as yet. It can go either way. We will have to see how it goes on Saturday morning. It is easier said than done but it will not be easy for them to save the match on this wicket.         
	Will you force a follow on?         
	That I will tell you tomorrow.         
	You did not do too well with the bat. Now that you have taken three wickets, do you feel compensated?         
	I am basically a batsman. I am disappointed not to get runs here. I am happy that I got three wickets so far and now I have a chance to get five wickets in an innings. I was entrusted with a job by the team and I tried my best to do that.         
	Of the three wickets you got, which one do you value the most?         
	Haydens wicket was very important because he is known for playing big innings. I am also happy that I dismissed Ponting because had these two stayed at the wicket it would have been difficult for us to contain the Australians.         
	Did you find the Australians an aggressive lot?         
	That is only on paper.         
	What do you think about the ICC ban on Gambhir?         
	I am yet not fully aware of the ICC verdict. I think Gambhir felt guilty and said so to the match referee. I also think the punishment was a bit harsh on him. They could have let him off with a fine.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Advantage India: Harbhajan
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Harbhajan Singh feels Englands defensive cricket in the opening session made things easier for the Indians on Day I of the series.         
	England were not looking to score runs after winning the toss. They were only trying to keep their wickets intact. If we were batting we would have scored more than 300 runs during the day, the off-spinner said on Thursday.         
	They were in a defensive mode and we were happy to restrict them to 63 for no loss at lunch. They didnt look like wanting to score.         
	We were looking to bowl in the right areas and had set the field accordingly. We played to our plan and England helped us by not playing too many shots, Harbhajan explained.         
	The opening day has left the Indians satisfied. The wicket is playing well. Winning the toss is a big advantage in these circumstances but we did well to restrict them. If we continue this way we can get them out early on the second day.         
	Did they show too much respect to the bowling? I dont know if they did that The wicket is playing slow. You need to play strokes on this type of wicket. Strangely they were defensive.         
	This wicket will turn more and today was their best chance to get some runs on the board... We were not irritated by the batting but enjoyed it, he said.         
	Will it be tough for India to bat the fourth innings on this wicket? Weve got quality batsmen and I dont think that will be a problem. They have Monty Pansear and Graeme Swann in their attack but they are not used to these hot and humid conditions. Only (Andrew) Flintoff can make a difference because of his experience, Harbhajan felt.         
	The offie thinks Englands chances lie with Flintoff. Friddie can hit the deck hard. He is a quality bowler. Im not saying Monty cant get us out but it will be hard work.         
	Harbhajan said the team wasnt unduly worried when England were cruising at 164 for one. We knew things would happen in the last session. It was a matter of just one or two wickets. It would have been nice to get Flintoff out today.         
	Is the team missing Anil? Theres no point talking about it Anil bhais absence can never be filled. But Im doing my best in guiding the youngsters Amit (Mishra) is doing well he has good potential.         
	He also had a word of praise for Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma. Theyve been working wonders with the old ball. They have worked hard on their fitness and its showing. Both are doing a great job. They are bowling their hearts out.         
	Harbhajan did not forget to thank England for coming back for the tour. It was great that England showed the courage to come back. Hats off to them! Its good to get along with the game again.

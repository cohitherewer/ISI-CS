                                                     Brett Lee warning for the Indians

   SHARP SINGLES - Down Under 
        Brett Lee
   
	 Brett Lee has warned it may get worse for the Indian batsmen in the remaining matches of the series.
 
	The fast bowler said the Australian attack was relishing the prospect of bowling on the lively wickets of Sydney, and then Perth, after toiling on the slow MCG deck in the Boxing Day Test. 
 
	Sydney is going to have a bit more (life) in it, especially for the quicks, Lee told The Herald Sun. And then weve got Perth . . . who knows what might happen over there. We were bowling on a pretty benign wicket in Melbourne, very low and slow and that doesnt really suit the quicks. But I thought we did a great job in Melbourne on that wicket. 
 
	The ball ended up looking like a dog had a good go at it. Up here (in Sydney) should suit fast bowling a lot more.
 
	Lee said the Australian quicks and spinners were confident they could replicate the performance in the second Test, which starts on Wednesday. We have to stay really focused and keep going through and executing the plans we have been focusing on, Lee said. He said he was satisfied with the second innings wicket of Sachin Tendulkar in Melbourne.
 
	You work on a plan. Try to get in some short stuff and then throw one out wide, and he bit at it. Yeah, that was very pleasing, Lee said. I am hard on myself and dont like to talk myself up, but I think over the past couple of months collectively is the best Ive bowled for my country. Its the result of hard work and a little bit of heartache.
 
	SCG pitch to help pacers 
 
	 Indias hopes of getting a turner in the traditionally spinner friendly wicket at the Sydney Cricket Ground were dashed with the curator predicting that the pitch would be more favourable for fast bowlers than it has ever been in the past. I think we will see a lot of bounce and good carry in it. I do not see any gremlins in it. I expect it to be a very similar to the Ashes deck last year, curator Tom Parker said ahead of the second Test.
 
	Parker believed that warm weather had helped his team prepare a wicket containing plenty of life. Thats bad news for the tourists who are looking for its batsmen to fire in Sydney.
 
	Parker said inclement weather forecast for later in the week, and over the weekend, might also tip the scales back to the quicks. The weather is supposed to turn a little bit nasty I think hellip; You lose time (or) you get an overcast day, it might start swinging around. But other than that, it should be a normal SCG pitch.

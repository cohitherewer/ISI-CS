	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan closed in on their 28th CFL Premier Division title after outsmarting city rivals Camellia George Telegraph 1-0 in their penultimate tie of the ongoing league at the Mohun Bagan ground on Tuesday.         
	Bagan, who are now on 30 points from 13 outings will have to wait since second placed Mohammedan Sporting (with 24 points) still have two matches to finish the league.         
	Bagans seasoned striker Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto put them in the lead in the 30th minute of the match that saw Camellia George Telegraph play well for the umpteenth time this season.         
	Raghu Nandys boys  Man of the Match Suva Kumar, Pradip Roy along with captain Maduako Francis and F.. Ipekere  set the Mohun Bagan ground on fire with an array of passes and good positional play.         
	But one folly in the 30th minute saw them conceding the goal. George Telegraph custodian Swarup Das who was otherwise brilliant surged out of position when Barreto grabbed a Lalram Luaha pass from the centre. The Brazilian with a precise tip off his right-footer rolled it into the net.         
	Bagan were reduced to a 10-man army after substitute Ishfaq Ahmed was given the marching orders for roughing up referee Rathin Mukherjee.

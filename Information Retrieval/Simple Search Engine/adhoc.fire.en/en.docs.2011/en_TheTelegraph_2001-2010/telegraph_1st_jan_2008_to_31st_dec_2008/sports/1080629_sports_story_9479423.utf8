            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan captain, Shoaib Malik, and the three-member national selection committee, headed by Salahuddin Ahmed, have been feuding over three players for quite some time.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the players in question are Younis Khan, Shahid Afridi and Kamran Akmal.         
	While the selectors, apparently, have been resisting Maliks plea to drop Younis and Afridi, the captains choice  Akmal  got dropped for the ongoing Asia Cup.         
	Relations between the captain and the selectors are strained... Maliks agenda is to have his men in the team, one of the sources pointed out.         
	That all is not well was indicated by Malik himself, the other day, when he told a media conference that he just didnt have the final say in the selection of the XI at home.         
	Meanwhile, the Asia Cups technical committee has okayed Abdur Rauf as the injured Umar Guls replacement. Gul is out for at least a fortnight.

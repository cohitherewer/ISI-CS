	Colombo: The Indians may not have dazzled much in their only practice match ahead of the Test series against Sri Lanka, which ended in a tame draw but coach Gary Kirsten today said he was satisfied with his players performance.         
	I am happy that we were able to warm up before the first Test. We wanted to spend as much time as possible in the field, Kirsten said after the match on Sunday.         
	He defended Anil Kumbles decision of not bowling in the second innings.         
	The Indian captain was taking care of his fitness, said Kirsten, when asked why the Indian captain did not roll his arm over in the second essay of the match.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, who made 69 in the first innings, did not bat in the second innings as Sourav Ganguly was promoted to the No.4 position.         
	Kirsten said Tendulkar did not to come out to bat as he has had enough practice in the first essay. He spent enough time at the crease during the first innings, he said. (PTI)

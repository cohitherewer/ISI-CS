	Wellington: The second Test between New Zealand and the West Indies in Napier ended in a draw on Tuesday after the hosts gave up the run chase with an hour to go.         
	New Zealand finished their second innings on 220 for five, still 92 runs behind the winning target of 312, with Jesse Ryder on 59 and James Franklin on two.         
	New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori and the West Indies counterpart Chris Gayle agreed to call the game off with nine overs to go after it became apparent neither side was in a position to win.         
	The draw means the two-Test series ended 0-0, following a similar result in last weeks rain-affected match in Dunedin. (AGENCIES)

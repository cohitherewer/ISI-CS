The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I did the right thing: Ponting
                                                I did the right thing: Ponting
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Ricky Ponting on Tuesday maintained that he had done nothing wrong by reporting Harbhajan Singh for racially abusing Andrew Symonds.         
	When I heard what had taken place with Andrew I immediately informed the umpires and then left the field at the end of the over to inform our team manager, which is what we are instructed to do. There is absolutely no place for racism in sport or in society generally and I fully support the International Cricket Councils anti-racism policy. All our players are very aware of their responsibility.         
	Making this report is not something I wanted to do but something I had to do. I had nothing to gain personally from taking this action. I was doing the right thing by the game. I hope that what I have done will enhance the game in the future and also be an example to the wider community when it comes to dealing with the difficult issue of racism, Ponting wrote in his column in The Australian.         
	He also said that it was unfair on Anil Kumbles part to say the Australian team lacked sportsmanship.         
	It is a shame that this issue has come to dominate the Test because, from my point of view, I believe that overall both the Melbourne and Sydney Tests were played in terrific spirit. This is not something we take lightly so it is surprising and disappointing to hear Anil Kumble suggest that we did not play within that spirit in Sydney.         
	I believe that as a general rule both teams have got on really well. There was talk in the dressing room of some of the banter that went on out in the middle and some of it was quite funny from both sides, he wrote.         
	On his counterpart, he said: I like Anil as a bloke and admire him as a cricketer and now captain. I have always felt he played his cricket in the right way, hard but fair. And I believe that is what we do, too. Anil and I came to an agreement before the series about how catches should be judged.         
	At the usual Match Referees meeting at the start of the series Mike Procter said that all catches which were uncertain would be referred to the third umpire by the on-field umpires. I have never liked this because I believe technology is not good enough to judge low catches in particular, and I think that is obvious at some stage in just about every Test.         
	Instead I have always preferred an agreement where the batting side takes the word of the fielding side. So Anil and I decided that we would ask our fielders if they were 100 per cent satisfied they had taken a catch if it was not obvious, he said.         
	He added that perhaps Sourav Ganguly, who was given out in a controversial manner, was not aware of the agreement.         
	In the first innings, I took a low catch off Rahul Dravid but wasnt satisfied it carried so I told the umpire immediately. In the second innings, Michael Clarke took a low catch off Sourav. I went to him and asked if he was 100 per cent sure he had caught it. He said yes, so I relayed that to the umpires.         
	It appears that Sourav wasnt fully aware of the agreement I had with Anil because if he was he would probably have left the field straight away.

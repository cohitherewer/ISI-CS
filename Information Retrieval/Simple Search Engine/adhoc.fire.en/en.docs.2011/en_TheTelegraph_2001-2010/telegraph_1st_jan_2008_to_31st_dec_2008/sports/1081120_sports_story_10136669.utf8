The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India squad will be for 2 ODIs, not 4
                                                                                                                                                                                                       India squad will be for 2 ODIs, not 4
  - Sachin Tendulkar to return RP under pressure       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Calcutta: The national selectors intend picking the squad for the fourth and fifth ODIs only, in Kanpur on Thursday evening, and not for all the remaining matches against Kevin Pietersens England.         
	The selectors have made such a suggestion to the Board and the understanding is that they will be selecting 15 for the Bangalore and Cuttack ODIs and not for Guwahati and Delhi as well, a source told The Telegraph.         
	According to the source, the selectors  Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat  want the option of picking lesser-known faces for the last two matches if the series is decided by the Cuttack ODI (the contests fifth, on November 26).         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis Team India is 2-0 up and England need something extraordinary to at least begin making an impact.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, meanwhile, will be back in the squad. The senior-most pro had opted out of the first three matches.         
	Hes confirmed his availability, the source pointed out.         
	With Sachin returning, uncapped (in ODIs, that is) opener Murali Vijay will have to be omitted.         
	The selectors, one learns, have been contemplating dropping the ineffective Rudra Pratap Singh and bringing back Irfan Pathan (who has been doing well in the Ranji Trophy), but Dhoni has plenty of faith in the former.         
	In fact, hours before the Kanpur match, the captain gave Rudra Pratap the thumbs up in a big way.         
	Look, he has not played with the team for a while and its always difficult to make a comeback It is at times like this that you need to completely back him He has been one of the best bowlers against England and even though he is looking a bit rusty (one for 74 in nine overs), the team will back him and we hope he will come back strong.         
	A message there for the selectors too, perhaps.         
	Solid support notwithstanding, Rudra Pratap will have to deliver on Thursday. That hes absolutely familiar with the Green Park, home ground of his parent association, should work to his advantage.         
	If that does happen, then Irfan will have to continue waiting. Elder brother Yusuf is, of course, in the squad and produced a superb innings in the second ODI (Indore).         
	Today, hes definitely seen as the more valuable Pathan.

	 Name: Dawn Fraser         
	 Country: Australia         
	 Date of birth: 1937-09-04         
	 Birthplace: Sydney

	 Weight: 65.0 kg         
	 Discipline: 100m freestyle, relays         
	 World records: 28 (100m freestyle, 200m freestyle, 4x100m freestyle relay, 110 yds butterfly)Olympic Games (8 medals - 4 gold, 4 silver)

	Whether it was due to a modest background, or a refusal to give up swimming even when banned in the early stages of her career, Dawn Frasers determination led her to battle adversity and ultimately conquer the sprint events at three consecutive Olympic Games.         
	Recording a time of 1:02 for the 100m in Melbourne, doubtful judges delayed the astonishing announcement  it equalled the mens Australian record, registered only a few years previously.         
	Three Olympic titles in 1956, 1960 and 1964 in the 100m freestyle eventually brought the daughter of a Sydney docker justified success.         
	Prior to the Tokyo Games, she suffered a near-irreversible setback when she was at the wheel while involved in a car crash with her mother. Her mother died and it seemed Fraser was lost to swimming.         
	Instead, despite having to wear a neck brace for several months, depriving her of a proper training schedule, she came back to win 100m gold at the Games in a time of 59.5.         
	A year before Sydney 2000, Fraser was voted female swimmer of the century in Vienna by a top-level international jury headed by Juan Antonio Samaranch, then president of the International Olympic Committee.         
	Samaranch then appointed her the First Lady of the Olympic Games.

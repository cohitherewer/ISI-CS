The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Three spinners were par for this course, says Prasanna
                                                                                                                                                                                           Three spinners were par for this course, says Prasanna

	Bangalore: Erapalli Prasanna thinks India will have to pay the price for faulty team selection in the Bangalore Test. The visitors rode centuries from captain Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey to reach 430 in the first innings.         
	The performance has been pretty disappointing We havent played to our strengths. Weve allowed the Australians to walk away with the initiative. Spin is our strength and we should have played three spinners in this opening Test, the legendary off-spinner told The Telegraph.         
	I was amazed to see Amit Mishra not playing. Tackling pace is to the Aussies liking. Spin is their weak point and they were apprehensive about it even before coming here. The uncertainties created by a spinner would have kept them guessing.         
	The pacers might have picked up nine wickets, but playing a third spinner would have kept them under pressure With (Anil) Kumble and Harbhajan (Singh) not doing well, that was essential. If needed, they could have included a fifth bowler at the expense of a batsman. This is just not on, Prasanna explained.         
	Kumble and Harbhajan together bowled 84 overs, with figures of one for 232, the worst effort in a Test involving the duo.         
	What is then wrong with their bowling? I think there is a lot of pressure on Kumble since he became captain. I wouldnt say captaincy is affecting his bowling but he has to perform.         
	His captaincy may be good, but he has to realise that it is his bowling that is of utmost importance to the team.         
	He should concentrate more on his bowling, Prasanna said.         
	As for Harbhajan, he is not finding his rhythm. He is trying too many things. He should concentrate on the basics, he added.         
	Prasanna, however, did not wish to get involved in the talk surrounding the retirement of the seniors. I wouldnt like to make a comment. Its for them to make a judgement, he signed off.

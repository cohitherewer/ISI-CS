  - Ashwell Princes patient 101 not enough             Monty Panesar celebrates the dismissal of AB de Villiers at Lords on Saturday. (AFP)                           
	London: Monty Panesar exposed South Africas historic fallibility against spin bowling on Saturday with four for 74 on the third day of the first Test at Lords.         
	Panesar helped dismiss South Africa for 247 in their first innings in reply to Englands 593 for eight declared. The visitors were 13 for no wicket at the close in their second innings after being asked to follow on.         
	Ashwell Prince was the only batsman to defy the bowling for any length of time, compiling a doggedly resourceful 101 in his first Test against England. His eighth Test hundred took six minutes short of five hours and he hit 13 boundaries and a six.         
	South Africa, resuming the day on seven for no wicket, lost three of their top four batsman in the opening session to the England pace attack, although the ball did little in the air or off the pitch.         
	Captain Graeme Smith was caught for eight from the 12th delivery of the day at gully off James Anderson, Hashim Amla (6) edged Stuart Broad to wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose and the prolific Jacques Kallis (7) was caught at first slip by Andrew Strauss off Ryan Sidebottom. Panesar got into the act with his first delivery after lunch. Opener Neil McKenzie, who had stood firm while his colleagues faltered, was bowled leg-stump for 40 with a ball which turned sharply out of the rough created by the bowlers footmarks.         
	Prince and AB de Villiers partially restored their sides fortunes with a fourth-wicket partnership of 78 which was ended by Panesar when Anderson leaped high at mid-on to catch the latter for 42.         
	Morne Morkel could make little of Panesar and was bowled for four through a wide gap between bat and pad and Paul Harris succumbed for six to another fine catch by Anderson, this time diving forward.         
	Throughout the chaos at the other end, left-hander Prince persevered with unremitting concentration on a pitch still full of runs.         
	He played Panesar confidently, reverse-sweeping a four and hitting the Englishman over the mid-wicket boundary two balls later.         
	His century was a due reward for his diligence and emphasised the failings of his teammates on a benign pitch.         
	At 203 for eight, the end of the South African innings seemed imminent but Dale Steyn hung on as England went on the defensive, conceding singles to Prince to give the strike to the tailender.         
	Sidebottom finally made the breakthrough when Prince played a tired looking shot outside the off-stump and was caught by Ambrose.         
	With the light failing, Michael Vaughan returned to Panesar and introduced Kevin Pietersens occasional off-spin. Pietersen responded by capturing the wicket of Steyn, caught by Sidebottom for 19.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ivanovic ousted
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ivanovic ousted
                            
	Moscow: Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia caused an upset in the second round of the Kremlin Cup on Wednesday by beating the fourth seed Serb Ana Ivanovic 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). Olympic champion Elena Dementieva showed her fighting qualities to outlast Slovenian qualifier Katarina Srebotnik 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 quarter finals.         
	Dementieva hit two successive aces in the tiebreak to end a contest that lasted nearly three hours.         
	Ive played her several times this season and every time I have had problems with her game, said holder Dementieva who lost to Srebotnik in their last encounter in Tokyo last month. I was prepared this time and it paid off, she told reporters.         
	Mens third seed Mikhail Youzhny was not so lucky, going down to fellow Russian Teimuraz Gabashvili 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 in the first round.         
	World No. 22 Youzhny paid the price for losing his cool in the tiebreak as he allowed the 66th-ranked Gabashvili to reel off the last seven points in the match. Womens eighth seed Anna Chakvetadze, who has struggled for form for much of the year, also disappointed home fans at the Olympic sports complex when she lost to Caroline Wozniacki 2-6, 6-1, 6-4.         
	Russian Dinara Safina was slated to take on former world No.1 Amelie Mauresmo later on Wednesday. (Reuters)

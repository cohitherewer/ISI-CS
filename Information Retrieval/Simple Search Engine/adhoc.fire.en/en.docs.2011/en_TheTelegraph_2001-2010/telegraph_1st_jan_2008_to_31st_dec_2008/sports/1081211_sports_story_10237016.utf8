The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England are a better bowling side: Dhoni 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       England are a better bowling side: Dhoni 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Dhoni on Wednesday                           
	Chennai: Mahendra Singh Dhoni stressed the need to get the basics right against England in the Test series. He felt it was a big opportunity for the youngsters who will fill the places left vacant by Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Plans for the Test series         
	Of course, I cant disclose the plans. We had a good run in all formats whether its Tests, one-dayers or Twenty20 And we want to end-up with a good result in this series as well.         
	The England bowling         
	Of course, they are a better bowling side. At the same time our batsmen are in good nick and we have been getting the basics right. We have planned and prepared accordingly. The execution has been good. We need to focus on that, and we dont want to think too much about the opposition attack.         
	Rahul Dravids dismal form         
	He has been shaping up really well at nets. We know the amount of talent he has got, and he is also one the most committed cricketers around. He will definitely get runs in the series and make headway.         
	If the team has any plans for the Mumbai terror victims         
	I dont really believe in words We will do whatever we need to do. We dont want to really announce anything. Individually, too, I am doing my bit.         
	The stringent security         
	It is really important... This is one area that, as cricketers and as a team, we dont have any control over . Our job is to remain calm and composed, and look into areas like playing cricket, and getting the preparation right.         
	If England will come back stronger         
	They got time off in between and they must have planned a few things. I think we need to start from scratch. To make it simple, you need partnerships in the middle, both in batting and bowling. All this has to be backed up by good fielding.         
	If the gap would prove crucial         
	We had some time and went back to spend it with our families. The incidents were sad, but the only good part was that we got some time to spend with our families.                     
	The terror strikes in Mumbai         
	We were not really thinking about cricket at that point of time. When it happened we were so sad. We were glued to the television. During those 70 hours or so, I really slept just six hours.         
	The wicket         
	If you look at the Chennai wicket there has been some bounce for the fast bowlers. Spinners will also get some assistance as the game progresses, and since the turn comes along with bounce, spinners like to bowl here. When we played Sri Lanka here the last time, Murali had bowled well.         
	On Yuvraj filling in for Sourav Ganguly         
	The biggest mistake will be if he tries to fill the shoes of Sourav. He should be himself. He is a very different individual. His gameplan is different and he plays in a different way. He has been in good nick and he just needs to continue that. Of course, he can be a part time bowler as well.         
	If the intensity will be the same         
	Of course we need to be at the same level. It does not matter what opposition we are playing. You have to be aggressive in international cricket it has to be controlled though. The focus should be on execution of plans. If we can execute our plans on the field we have a good chance of doing well.         
	The absence of Kumble         
	If you are thinking about replacing Anil Kumble then you are in for real trouble. That is why I say you need to be yourself. We will miss him (Kumble). It will be really tough replacing the players who have retired from international cricket.         
	His impression of the current team         
	More or less we have played the same side against Australia. Anil bhai was not there for a couple of games. Amit Mishra has done well. I do not think the basics changed a lot. Of course, the guys who have retired were much more experienced. They were people who could read the game very well. It is an opportunity for the youngsters More often, it is the one who reads the game very well that comes out the winner.         
	The importance of this series         
	Every series is important. Be it against Bangladesh or any other team. It is an international series. It goes into your record. We need to win this series also. For that we need to get our basics right.         
	On England returning for the Test series         
	It is good on their part to come. Frankly speaking, it does not really bother us. We need to concentrate on the areas that we need to do well. Just as every other Indian, I am grateful to them for coming. Sadly, the incident occurred during a series like this. We have an important series to play. The best thing that I could give to India at this juncture is a good game of cricket. That is what we are here to do as professional cricketers.

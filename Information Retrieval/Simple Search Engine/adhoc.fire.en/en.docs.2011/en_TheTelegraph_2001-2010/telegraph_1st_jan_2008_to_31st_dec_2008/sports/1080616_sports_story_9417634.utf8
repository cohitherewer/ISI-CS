The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Preeja achieves qualifying norm
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Preeja achieves qualifying norm
                      
	London: Preeja Sreedharan has achieved the B qualifying norms for the Beijing Olympics after finishing as the runner-up in 10,000m run of the British Miles Club elite Grand Prix by slicing more than a minute from the national record timing set by her.         
	Sreedharan finished second behind local Jo Pavey on Saturday with a new national record timing of 32:04.41s, an improvement of more than a minute from her prior record of 33:19.71s set in Calcutta on May 13 last year.         
	So far there is no qualification from India in this event and if none other athlete makes the cut in A category which has higher benchmark in the competitions to be held till July 23, Sreedharan will represent the country at the Beijing Games.         
	However in the mens section, it was heartbreak for Surendra Singh, who broke a 32-year-old record in 10,000m run (28:48.72s) set in 1976 Montreal Olympics by Hari Chand, with a timing of 28:22.79s but fell short of breaching the Olympic qualifying time.         
	Surendra was running in UK Olympics trials at Watford, outside of London. By breaking the record, he improved his personal best by more than 30 seconds. Teammate Sandip Kumar finished fourth with a new personal best of 29:17.97s.         
	Rajeev Ramesan clocked his personal best in 800m with a timing of 1:47.20s to win the overall 800m run, while Sajeesh Joseph grabbed the second place with a timing of 1:47.67s.         
	Indian team will come back to Watford on June 18 to take part in BMC Gold races.         
	Indian athletes have set three national records after arriving to London.           (PTI)

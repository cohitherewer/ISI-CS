                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tendulkar out of Kanpur Test too
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar was on Saturday ruled out of the third Test against South Africa in Kanpur. Sachin has been nursing a groin injury that forced him to miss the second Test.         
	Sachin Tendulkar will be unavailable for selection for the third Test match due to his right groin injury. Sachin is making good progress but he has not recovered sufficiently to be available for the third Test, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said in a media release.         
	This decision has been taken to give Sachin the opportunity to make a full recovery from this injury. Sachin has a rehabilitation programme to continue with and will be monitored closely, he added.         
	Sachin, who missed part of the action on the first, second and the fourth days of the Chennai Test, didnt take the field on the final day.         
	He suffered the injury during the tour Down Under and aggravated it while playing the first Test.

	Johannesburg: Allrounder Shaun Pollock said he was at peace with his decision to retire from international cricket on Sunday. 
    
	The 34-year-old scored the winning runs in South Africas eight-wicket victory over the West Indies to clinch a 5-0 series clean-sweep in his last match for his country. 
    
	Its been a fantastic journey for me but retiring is all good. I have real peace about it, Pollock told reporters. 
    
	Pollock, who was also South Africas most economical bowler on Sunday with one for 33 in his 10 overs, was named joint Man of the Series with South African batsman J.P. Du- miny. 
    
	To finish on a high has been awesome and its ended just perfectly. 
    
	Its been a great profession to have for the last 12 years and I would do it all again. My philosophy was very much keep it simple, stupid, Pollock said. 
    
	He was surprised by the impact his decision had had on cricket fans in South Africa, with all five matches watched by near capacity crowds. 
    
	Ive been blown away by the reception at every match. It could have been sad but Ill take away such fond memories because the crowds have carried me, he said. 
    
	Pollock finished on 10 not out after South Africa chased down a daunting target of 211 in 31 overs, revised due to rain interruptions, the bulk of the work being done by Herschelle Gibbs (102) and Jacques Kallis (74 not out) in a second-wicket stand of 175 off 148 balls. 
    
	Its been an emotional rollercoaster and I feel drained and tired for the first time in my career, Pollock said.

	Calcutta: The moment you walk into Jose Ramirez Barretos apartment on Southern Avenue, you are enveloped by a hushed silence.         
	Two big suitcases kept haphazardly by the front door, a couple of tricycles  belonging to daughters Natalia and Isabella  lying in a corner, a stuffed teddy on a chair and sundry household items scattered around: all indicative of a mind not at peace.         
	Just a few weeks ago, the place was bustling with fun  his kids playing around, Mohun Bagan players and officials breezing in and out and Barreto was enjoying every bit of it. But when things seem too good to be true, they probably are, as Barreto found out to his detriment.         
	Now, he is separated from his family and embroiled in controversy. He cuts a lonely figure, his laptop the only tool with which he keeps in touch with his family, also spending sleepless nights in Brazil.         
	Most of the time I am now with the laptop I chat with my wife (Veronica) throughout the day and thats how I am keeping in touch with my family Getting messages from my kids helps me stay positive, Barreto told The Telegraph.         
	The Brazilian, who was to leave for Brazil on March 20, was arrested at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport under the Foreign Exchange Management Act after he was found to be carrying dollars in excess of the permissible amount. He had to surrender his passport and was later granted bail after being produced at the Barasat court.         
	Veronica and his two daughters had left for Brazil in February and Barreto was about to join them Mohun Bagans season came to an end.         
	What has happened is quite unfortunate I never thought that I would land up in such a situation. The past few days have helped me mature and handle things with more responsibility Maybe the Almighty God is testing my patience But I am confident that Ill come out of all this with His help. I read the Bible everyday and thats giving me strength, the 31-year old said.         
	But this loneliness is killing me I am very much a family man. I always prefer staying with my family whenever there is no game. I am missing my daughters, my wifeThey are my world.         
	Veronica is getting very anxious She calls me several times a day Always asking how long will it take for me to be out of this trouble and be in Brazil I really have no idea, he said.         
	The club officials are quite supportive. They are trying to do everything to help me get out of this mess, he added.         
	The former Mohun Bagan captain is scheduled to appear before the court on Thursday.         
	Barreto, who has already extended his contract with the green-and-maroons for another season, is keen on playing against Bayern Munich on May 28. Admitting that he had never dreamed of playing against someone of Oliver Kahns stature, Barreto said: I am eagerly awaiting that match and it will be a great experience. I have never thought of playing against him (Kahn) its perhaps destined...

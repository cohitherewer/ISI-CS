The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer could miss SA series
                                                   Zaheer could miss SA series
                      
	Bangalore: Left-arm quick Zaheer Khan has almost ruled himself out of the upcoming Test series versus South Africa, saying he needs four to six weeks to be match-fit.         
	The first Test starts on March 26 in Chennai.         
	I am not (yet) ready for international cricket. I should be okay in four-six weeks, said Zaheer, who pulled out of the first Test against Australia last year owing to an ankle injury.         
	I have started bowling but doctors have advised me not to push myself. Thats one thing I have learnt with experience.         
	I have been advised to start with one-dayers and club games. The progress after rehabilitation has been good, he said.         
	Zaheer, is also part of the Bangalore Royal Challengers in the Indian Premier League.         
	Bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad said Zaheer, who returned last week from a three-week rehabilitation programme in Johannesburg, needs time to regain full fitness. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson hails special United 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ferguson hails special United 
                      
	Manchester: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said on Wednesday he saw something special in his team and wanted them to prove it in their mouth-watering Champions League semi-final against Barcelona.         
	United reached the last four for the second successive season by beating AS Roma 1-0 at Old Trafford to complete a 3-0 aggregate win and now face the Spanish giants with the first leg at the Nou Camp where they won the 1999 Champions League final.         
	Ferguson told a news conference: We are delighted to be in the semi-finals and the fact that its Barcelona makes it an attractive semi-final. We are looking forward to it.         
	You have opportunities in life when you have got something really special in your club and I think weve got something special in this team. We want to go there and show what a good team we are. Barcelona have a fantastic history and is a very good club but we cant go there and be negative.         
	We have to go there and be really positive and if we do that we have a marvellous chance. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard is also already looking forward to a high-octane semi-final.         
	I think we have to get ready for two great games against a team that is in top form and play very good football, Rijkaard told a news conference after Barcelonas 2-0 aggregate win over the Bundesliga side.         
	Im delighted to have the chance of playing against them. We are two teams that play very good football, added Rijkaard, who will be without defender Carles Puyol for the first leg at the Nou Camp after he was booked on Wednesday.         
	The level in the Champions League semi-finals is very high and anything can happen, so Im not prepared to say who are the favourites.         
	Ferguson believes his side will be better prepared to face Barcelona if Nemanja Vidic, Nani and Louis Saha complete their recovery from injuries and everyone else stays fit.

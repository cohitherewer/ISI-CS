The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant, Sidebottom out of first ODI
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ishant, Sidebottom out of first ODI

	Calcutta/Mumbai: Ishant Sharma has been ruled out of the first one-dayer against England in Rajkot due to an ankle injury. England seamer Ryan Sidebottom will also miss the opening match with an Achilles injury, a team spokesman said on Wednesday.         
	The first of the seven one-dayers is on Friday.         
	Ishant, who bagged the Man of the Series award in the recently concluded Test series against Australia with 15 wickets, has been advised rest for five days.         
	Ishant Sharma has got a mild ankle sprain and he has been advised rest for five days. He is undergoing his rehabilitation at present and is making good progress. Hence he would not be available for the first ODI against England, the BCCI said in a press release.         
	The injury also puts a cloud on his participation for the second one-dayer on Monday.         
	With three specialist pacers already in the squad  Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel and Rudra Pratap Singh  the BCCI has not named a replacement.         
	Sidebottom is yet to recover from the Achilles problem that has dogged him since the start of the Stanford Twenty20 competition in the Caribbean last month.         
	The visitors also have concerns over fast bowler Stuart Broad who missed Tuesdays warm-up match with a sore knee after suffering the problem in the first warm-up game on Sunday where he bowled only four overs.         
	Broads chance of playing the first match of the series would hinge on the outcome of Thursdays fitness test, said coach Peter Moores.         
	Broad picked up the injury while trying to stop a boundary in Mumbai. It swelled a lot and though he has got injections, its only after he bowls Thursday that we can declare him fit for the match, Moores said.         
	In case Broad joins Sidebottom in the sidelines, England might go for a two-pronged spin attack with Graeme Swann and Samit Patel making to the playing XI.         
	In such a case, Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Andrew Flintoff will have to shoulder the responsibility in the pace department for the Kevin Pietersen-led side.

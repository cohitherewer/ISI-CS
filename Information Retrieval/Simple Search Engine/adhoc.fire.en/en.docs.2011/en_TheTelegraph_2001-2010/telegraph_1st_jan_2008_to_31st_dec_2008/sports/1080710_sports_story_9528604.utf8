The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | On-court chemistry not a worry, says Paes
                                                                                                                                                                                                     On-court chemistry not a worry, says Paes
                      
	New Delhi: So far, they might have played just one tournament together but Leander Paes is not worried about his on-field chemistry with Mahesh Bhupathi and the Indian Davis Cup captain oozed confidence that they would dish out quality tennis in Beijing .         
	After a long hiatus, the bickering duo recently teamed up and finished runners up in the Ordina Open to kick start their preparation for the Olympics.         
	We were little unlucky not to win (Ordina Open). But when it comes to Mahesh and myself, the on-court chemistry is something we dont have to worry about, Paes told in a TV interview.         
	It is more about injuries, physical fitness and the camaraderie off-court that we need to focus more. But as far as tennis goes, it is of a very high level. We dont need to play that many tournaments to find that chemistry again, he said.         
	Paes does not deny the bad blood between him and Bhupathi but the tennis ace insists it does not affect the show when he walks out in the middle with Bhupathi.         
	When I step on the court with Mahesh, I go there and do my job. When I get off that I just move away and do my own things. We are two very different people and we do things differently. When the matches finish or the practice is over, we just move away and do our own things, said Paes.         
	Asked about the burden of expectation that would rest on the shoulders of both of them, Paes said, We have got to be very realistic about these expectations that we have.         
	At the end of the day when it comes to Olympics, we will not necessarily look at the medal-winning round but rather at every single match.         
	The first round, the second round. Thats when you build your confidence. Thats when you build your rhythm in the tournament. (PTI)

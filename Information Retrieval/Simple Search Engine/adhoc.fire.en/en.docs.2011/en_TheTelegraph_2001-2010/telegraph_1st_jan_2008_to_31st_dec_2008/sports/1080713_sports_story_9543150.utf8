            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Dav Whatmore, the National Cricket Academy (NCA) director operations, feels that young cricketers in the country should focus on maintaining consistency in the domestic circuit to earn opportunities in the next level.         
	Talking on the sidelines of the ongoing Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)-conducted Level A coaching course at Eden on Saturday, Whatmore stressed that the forthcoming tour of the India A side to Israel will be a good opportunity for young talents.         
	The India A squad are scheduled to play three one-day Internationals against Israel 60th Anniversary XI starting from Wednesday.         
	These opportunities are good for the youngsters. But they need to maintain their consistency, Whatmore, under whose tutelage the India under-19 team won the World Cup in March, emphasised.         
	They have to concentrate on their game and butter and consistency will take them to the next level, Whatmore added.         
	He however, also emphasised on the need of interaction with coaches all over the country to disseminate knowledge to the grassroot level.

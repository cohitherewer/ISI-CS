The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tim not keen on Andrew
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tim not keen on Andrew
                      
	Melbourne: Australian coach Tim Nielsen has praised Andrew Symonds for realising his mistake but ruled out the volatile allrounders quick return to the national side, saying such a move would undermine his teammates position.         
	Nielsen said Symonds has done a great job by pledging to behave responsibly in future but his comeback to the national team would take time.         
	At the moment, Symonds selection is something I dont want to think about. It would only undermine the players that are there, Nielsen said.         
	Its brilliant that he has got to this stage and put out a positive message, but I dont even want to start speculating about when he might return, he said.         
	Cricket Australia Chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch had also said Symonds will be monitored for a while before considering his inclusion into the national squad.         
	We have to see whether the all-rounder is fully committed to all of the things needed for a cricketer to be a member of the worlds number one team, Hilditch had said.         
	Symonds, who has apologised for his irresponsibility and pledged a better conduct, is expected to make a comeback in competitive cricket with his grade side, the Gold Coast Dolphins, over the next fortnight.         
	After that, he is due to feature in a few Twenty20 matches for Queensland and three Sheffield Shield and four domestic one-dayers to prove himself. (PTI)

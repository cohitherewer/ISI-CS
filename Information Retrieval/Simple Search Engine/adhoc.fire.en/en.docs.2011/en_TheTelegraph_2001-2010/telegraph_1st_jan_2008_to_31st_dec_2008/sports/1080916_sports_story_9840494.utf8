The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Middle-order failure a one-off thing: Dilip
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Middle-order failure a one-off thing: Dilip
  - Chief selector does not read too much into batsmens poor form in Sri Lanka             Dilip Vengsarkar                           
	Mumbai: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar feels the combined failure of the experienced Indian middle-order in Sri Lanka was a one-off thing and expects the batsmen to put it firmly behind them and start afresh in the upcoming four-Test series against Australia.         
	The Indian batting, at present, is the most experienced in world cricket. The Sri Lanka failure was one-off and I am sure they are all eager to put it behind them and start afresh, he said.         
	Vengsarkar also predicted the Australia series would be a very close affair.         
	Indias chances are very good. It will be, I guess, a closely fought series. India did extremely well in Australia in Tests and, in fact, should have won the series but few of the crucial decisions went against India. However, as they say in cricket, there are no ifs and buts. It will be a series that will be fought out between two of the worlds best Test teams, Vengsarkar said.         
	He also stressed on the need for the openers to fire in unison. Its a team game and everyone will have to chip in if India are to do well. However, Viru is in great form and he, along with Gautam Gambhir will make things easier if they fire at the top of the order.         
	On the dropping of Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh from the Rest of India side in the Irani Trophy, Vengsarkar said: In cricket, it boils down to form and fitness. After all, one has to deliver in those 22 yards and consistently too.         
	On Australia, he said: They are a world class side and they play positive cricket. I like the way they approach the game. They are supremely fit and very aggressive.         
	However, it depends a lot on how the younger lot (newcomers) adapt to the Indian wickets. Mind you, it wont be that easy. They surely will be under tremendous pressure.         
	Harbhajan Singhs form in Sri Lanka also seemed to have pleased the chief selector. Harbhajan loves challenge and the Aussies provide him with plenty of it. He bowled extremely well in Sri Lanka and I am sure he must be looking forward to the Australian series.         
	He was also full of praise for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Dhonis return to Tests will make a huge difference. He has matured a lot over the years and can handle tough situations with elan.         
	He also felt that players like Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma and S Badrinath were waiting in the wings. Yes, they are waiting in the wings.         
	However, they will have to keep scoring whenever they get the opportunities and in whatever matches they play. They are highly talented and good movers in the outfield too.

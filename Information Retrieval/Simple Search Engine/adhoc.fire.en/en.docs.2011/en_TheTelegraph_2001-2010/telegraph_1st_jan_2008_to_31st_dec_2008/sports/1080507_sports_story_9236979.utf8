            NICK ALLEN            Paul Gascoigne                           
	London: Troubled former footballer Paul Gascoigne was admitted to hospital after another bout of bizarre behaviour during which he allegedly threatened to kill himself.         
	Gascoigne, 40, reportedly asked staff at a luxury London hotel to bring him a steak knife and then said he was going to drown himself in a bath.         
	The former England player has struggled for years with alcoholism and depression and was detained under the Mental Health Act in February. He was released after two weeks of treatment, but the latest incident will raise further fears over his fragile state of mind.         
	Many senior figures in the game have compared his downward spiral to that of George Best, who also battled alcoholism, and have voiced regret that more has not been done to help him.         
	Gascoignes latest problems occurred while he was staying at the four-star Millennium Hotel in Knightsbridge, west London, on Sunday afternoon.         
	He ordered a steak from room service but then cancelled the request and told staff just to bring him the knife. Fearing he planned to harm himself, the hotels staff called the police.         
	But when two officers arrived at the room they found him holding his own head under the water in the bathtub and trying to keep it there. Six more police officers were called in as back-up and he eventually agreed to go to hospital. A source at the hotel said: ``He was completely out of it. It was a very sad sight to see and we just hope that he gets better.         
	A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed that officers were called to a hotel and that a man went to hospital voluntarily. He was not suspected of committing any criminal offence.         
	Fears had been growing for Gascoigne over the weekend after he was spotted having his hair dyed bright red in a salon. He looked frail and had to be helped across the road by a hairdresser afterwards. Hours later he had shaved off all his hair.         
	His detention under the Mental Health Act in February came after he exhibited erratic behaviour at the Malmaison Hotel in Newcastle, where he was recovering from a hip operation.         
	Gascoigne was found wandering around the building with three battery operated plastic parrots that said Give us a kiss to other guests.         
	He was also said to have ordered plates of raw liver to his room that he would leave and eat the next day, saying it was good for his blood. The hotel said staff and other guests had felt threatened by him.         
	Gascoigne was born in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and a successful playing career took in Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio and Rangers before fizzling out in the late 1990s. He earned 57 England caps, scoring 10 goals.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

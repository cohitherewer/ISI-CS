The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sheetal makes a mark
                                                     Sheetal makes a mark
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sheetal Iyer                           
	Calcutta: If Sania Mirza has put womens tennis in India on the international map, off the court Sheetal Iyer has achieved something similar.         
	The Punekar recently became the only woman in Asia to receive a Gold Badge in tennis refereeing. The Gold Badge, the highest officiating status, was awarded to her by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).         
	Tennis runs in Sheetals family. Her brother Nitin Kannamwar is a Bronze Badge chair umpire and a Gold Badge referee. Incidentally, the brother-sister duo got the Gold Badge together. Japans Nao Kawatei was the first to get this honour.         
	Having come from a tennis background, getting into officiating was not a problem for Sheetal. I quit playing in 1987 before doing a coaching course. In 1999, I got an ITF Level-I (White Badge) in umpiring. Till 2003, I was doing chair umpiring, Sheetal, a former national player, recalled.         
	In 2003, she switched to referring and got a Silver Badge. The Level-II degree helped her officiate in Davis Cup, Hyderabad and Bangalore WTA meets and in the 2006 Asian Games.         
	Doha Games was where my work got recognised and then ITF elevated me to this status, the 37-year-old said.         
	Initially, there was an air of disapproval from the players. I took that as a challenge and proved myself, Sheetal, who aspires to officiate in a Grand Slam, said.

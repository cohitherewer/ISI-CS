	Calcutta: After getting off to a winning start against New Delhi Heroes, city giants East Bengal take on JCT in the 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Saturday, in a match that could decide the semi-finalist from group C.         
	The fact that Sunil Chetri is among the goals will definitely be to East Bengals strength against the Punjab side. Playmaker Alvito DCunhas return to form is also something East Bengal can be happy about.         
	JCT too are on a high after winning their first match. Their win over I-League leaders Sporting Clube de Goa suggests their quality but inconsistency has been the bane of many a team this season.

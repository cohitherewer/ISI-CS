                                                   Australia, India in same group
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India and Australia are set to face off again in September as the two teams find themselves in the same group for the ICC Champions Trophy scheduled to be held in Pakistan.         
	Meanwhile, the ICC has no immediate security concerns over staging the Champions Trophy in Pakistan this September, a spokesman said on Thursday, a report adds from New Delhi.         
	India have been pooled with Ricky Pontings defending champions, arch-rivals Pakistan as well as the West Indies in group A.         
	The group B features South Africa, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and England.         
	The groupings for the biennial tournament were decided on the basis of the official one-day rankings as of March 12, an ICC statement added on Thursday.         
	The ICC decided three years ago to prune the field to eight teams from 10, following criticism of an unwieldy tournament.         
	The two top teams in each group after the round robin stage will qualify for the knockout semi-finals.               
	THE GROUPS         
	A: Australia (1), India (4), Pakistan (5), West Indies (8)         
	B: South Africa (2), New Zealand (3), Sri Lanka (6), England (7).

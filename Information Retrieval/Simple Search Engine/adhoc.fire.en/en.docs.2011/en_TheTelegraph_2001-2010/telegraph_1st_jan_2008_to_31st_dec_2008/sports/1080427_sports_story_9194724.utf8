The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjun Atwal makes cut
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arjun Atwal makes cut
                      
	Richmond: Arjun Atwal survived a late slump to turn in a two-under 70 in the second round and make the cut for weekend action in the $500,000 Henrico County Open on the Nationwide Tour.         
	The Orlando-based pro was tied for the 57th spot with a total of two-under 142.         
	Playing his back-nine first, Atwal could not have hoped for a better start as he birdied the 10th before picking up another stroke on the 12th.         
	He parred the next four holes before completing his first nine with back-to-back birdies on the 17th and 18th to make the turn four-under.         
	However, Atwal lost his way in the front nine as he bogeyed the third, seventh and ninth but a birdie sandwiched in between helped him stay within the cut-line.           (PTI)

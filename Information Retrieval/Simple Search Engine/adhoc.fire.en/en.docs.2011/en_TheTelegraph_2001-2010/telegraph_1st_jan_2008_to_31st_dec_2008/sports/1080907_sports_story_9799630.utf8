The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Putting the past behind, Serena is at her best

	New York: Serena Williams steamrolled Dinara Safina, smacking screaming winners past her and at her, and when she was done, Williams had even bent the swirling wind to her will.         
	Nothing was going to stop Williams from reaching the final of the US Open; not big sister Venus in the quarter finals, and certainly not Safina in the semi-finals. For Williams is playing her best tennis after five unsteady years.         
	With a fiercely executed 6-3, 6-2 semi-final victory on Friday, Williams advanced to her first Open final since 2002, the last time she won an Open championship.         
	Weather permitting Saturday night, Williams will meet Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, who advanced to her first Grand Slam final with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Elena Dementieva, who melted in a pile of nerves. Williams, who turns 27 in three weeks, wasted little time seizing her opportunity. Yeah, I have amazing will, Williams said matter-of-factly. I love to win.         
	She is looking to capture her ninth career Grand Slam singles title where she collected her first major trophy in 1999, back when she was a 17-year-old swinging freely.         
	A victory nine years later would give Williams the No. 1 ranking (she is No. 3 in the world, Jankovic is No. 2 and No. 1 Ana Ivanovic lost in the second round). Williams once held No. 1 for 57 straight weeks, but not since August 2003. Im here to stay, Williams said.         
	In a span of five years, a serious knee injury, the murder of her half-sister and other career interests, sent her ranking tumbling to triple digits.         
	It took a slow, frustrating two years to get back, after an unexpected Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in 2007, when she was ranked No. 81. Shes working hard now, but it would have come quicker if she had worked harder before, said her mother, Oracene Price.         
	She was referring to Venuss design company and Serenas acting interests. Serena collected three titles this season, including a win in Miami over Jankovic.         
	Im playing a lot more, having more consistent results, and just putting in the effort, Williams said. I think my results are finally showing.She will play in her second straight Grand Slam final, and has found her hunger again after a bitter defeat to Venus in the Wimbledon final.         
	There was little Safina could do to cut off Williamss deep crosscourt winners. When she came to the net once, she paid for it. In the third game of the second set, Williams inadvertently blasted a running approach shot directly at Safinas chest. Williams said she was mortified.         
	I wasnt trying to hit it at you, Williams said to Safina as they shook hands at the net.         
	Pity the player who takes such a blow usually aimed for the white line. I think she is the strongest player on the tour, together with her sister, said Jankovic, who is 3-3 against Serena. Nobody has the power that they have.         
	Jankovic, a player who routinely finishes rallies splayed in a split, is all about perseverance. She can endure because, at 23, she is healthy again.         
	This is the first Grand Slam I dont have any injuries, Jankovic said, as she rattled off a laundry list, including a strained glut muscle, an inflamed arm, a mysterious three-month virus this spring that left her nose running, and a torn meniscus in one of her knees, from which she said she miraculously recovered.         
	Now her mind is even stronger. I really believe in myself, Jankovic said. I really want to do this, and I think its about time for me to make that step forward to break that barrier and go a long way. I want to win a Grand Slam, and this is why I came here.         
	That was different from her Russian opponent, Dementieva, who came in as the Olympic champion and left satisfied with that. She shrugged off how she lost a 4-2 lead in the first set, lost her traditionally weak serve five times and committed 42 unforced errors.         
	Im not disappointed at all, Dementieva said. For me, the Olympics was my biggest goal. Williams won a gold medal in doubles with Venus in Beijing. But she wants more now, on the same court where she has found her will and where she can prove that she found her way back.

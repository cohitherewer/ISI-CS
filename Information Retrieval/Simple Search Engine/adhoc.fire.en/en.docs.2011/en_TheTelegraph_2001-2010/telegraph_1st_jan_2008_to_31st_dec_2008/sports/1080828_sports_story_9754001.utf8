                                                                                                                                                                                                     Australia pay tribute to Sir Don
                      
	Sydney: Australia celebrated the birth centenary of Sir Donald Bradman on Wednesday, paying tribute to the worlds greatest cricketer and a man who helped forge the nations identity.         
	Bradman, who died in 2001 aged 92 and played his last innings 60 years ago, retired with a Test batting average of 99.94.         
	He was hailed by current Australian captain Ricky Ponting as an incomparable figure in the history of cricket and of sport.         
	His name and what he achieved, its so far out of any players reach, in his time or any player who has played since, its almost like he played a different game to what were playing.         
	Is there anyone whos ever played any sport whos been able to achieve that level of greatness?         
	Bradman, born on August 27, 1908 in rural New South Wales, played first class cricket from 1927 to 1949 and Test cricket from 1928 to 1948.         
	He scored 28,067 first class runs at an average of 95.14 and 6,996 runs in 52 Tests with 29 centuries and a highest score of 334. .         
	His achievements in cricket came at a time when Australia was gradually drifting from its strong ties with Britain and he was seen as a hero for those times, helping Australians forge a sense of independence and national identity.         
	His life and career was to be commemorated Wednesday at functions in most state capitals cities and at events in the small towns of Cootamundra, where he was born, and Bowral, where he grew up.         
	No name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of Sir Donald Bradman, International Cricket Council president David Morgan said Wednesday.         
	Soccer has Pele and cricket has Bradman.           (AP)

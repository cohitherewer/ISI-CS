The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla ready to tour Pak
                                                   Bangla ready to tour Pak
                      
	Karachi: Bangladesh have agreed in principle to play a one-day series in Pakistan next month after Australia postponed their Test tour on Tuesday because of security concerns.         
	The world champions were due to visit Pakistan at the end of this month for a 30-day tour but put the trip on hold after a spate of suicide bombings.         
	PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said that although Bangladesh were set to play next month, Pakistan were hoping the postponed series against Australia would be held soon.         
	The series will be some time in April, he said, referring to the Bangladesh tour, adding the venues and dates would be worked out in the next few days.         
	We hope to host Australia for a full series before we go to there in late 2009, Ashraf added.         
	They took their decision after much deliberation and we accept that. We just want to hold this series soon.           (REUTERS)

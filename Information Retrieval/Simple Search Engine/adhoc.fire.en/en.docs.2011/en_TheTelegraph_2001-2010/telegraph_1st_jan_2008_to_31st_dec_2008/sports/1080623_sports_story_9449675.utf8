	Trainer J. Babu Raos prized colt Fleeting Arrow struck it rich, winning the 1,600m Colts Trial Stakes in Bangalore on Sunday. It was, however, a close call for the Burden Of Proof-Sabre Dance son who was taken to the wire by Archipenko, a less-fancied runner. Jockey K.P. Appu, who partnered the 13-4 favourite to victory, also survived an objection  lodged by C. Alford, the rider of Archipenko  on the grounds of interference in the final 300m of the race.           
	The fine performance of Fleeting Arrow and of Archipenko in the Colts Stakes, combined with Set Alights bloodless victory, in last Sundays Fillies Trial Stakes, is bound to make the 2,000m Bangalore Derby, on July 13, a very open affair.

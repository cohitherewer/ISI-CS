The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Twenty20 is all about team effort
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Twenty20 is all about team effort
                                    ASTUTE EYE
     STEPHEN FLEMING    
	Sitting on the sidelines for our game against Mumbai Indians on Wednesday, I quite enjoyed my new role as on-field commentator. Next to playing in a match, talking about it is the best thing in my opinion and since sitting on the fence is not something I do often, it was fun to watch the other guys battle it out.         
	As a rule, I have always enjoyed analysing and talking about cricket though it is too early to decide on whether I want to be a full-time commentator once my playing days are well and truly over!         
	What excites me right now is our encounter against the Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday, which is probably going to be one of our most difficult challenges this season.         
	As it is, the Twenty20 format is all about instant glory and instant doom, in which six balls can change the course of a match. As our game against Mumbai proved, the biggest names need not always be match winners. I completely agree with Matthew Haydens comments after the game that one is never secure in the Twenty20 format.         
	But to return to Saturdays game, theres plenty at stake for both teams because a decisive victory against the Knight Riders will mean a lot to us. And Im sure our opponents would also like to keep their winning record intact. This is their second away game and we intend to utilise the home ground advantage to the hilt. What we need to keep in mind is that every win in the Twenty20 format is a team effort and individuals will not take a team very far.             Suresh Raina played an important hand in the match vs Mumbai     
	Once again referring to something that Hayden said, Suresh Raina and Joginder Sharma played a crucial hand for us against Mumbai and that is the essence of the IPL. A team wont progress very far if they depend solely on overseas players or local stars. This is a long tournament and to keep the momentum going, teams need to bond as strongly as they can.         
	I have heard and read a few critics condemn the Indian Premier League (IPL) as entertainment disguised as cricket. No doubt theres plenty of razzmatazz with all the dancing and singing going on. However, I should think the first year will be about developing a brand and drawing fans.         
	Comparisons with the English Premier League, however strongly criticised, are inevitable because few premiership teams are home grown and you have to start somewhere as the IPL has done. The loyalty to IPL is already evident in the New Zealand players decision to stay with the franchises for a few more games before they join the national team in England.         
	It is definitely not a case of putting IPL before country but these compromise decisions will become increasingly frequent in future as cricket boards across the world try and find solutions that will please everyone. Players too would refuse to pass the opportunity to earn millions as long as it doesnt hamper national interests as the New Zealand board have done.  
	 Note: Stephen Fleming, one of the finest   captains of his generation, will be writing for   The Telegraph during the remainder of the   Indian Premier League   GAMEPLAN

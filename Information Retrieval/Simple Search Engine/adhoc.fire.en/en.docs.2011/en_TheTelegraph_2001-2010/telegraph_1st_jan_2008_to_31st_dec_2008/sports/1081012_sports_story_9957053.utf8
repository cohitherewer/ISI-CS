The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan lose to Sporting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bagan lose to Sporting
                      
	Margao: Sporting Clube de Goa scored a goal in each half to down depleted Mohun Bagan 2-0 in the third round of the ONGC I-League, played at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda. The winners, who led 1-0 at half time, scored through an own goal (25th) and substitute Nathaniel Amos (47th).         
	The win, their third in a row, took Sporting Clube de Goa to the top of the table with nine points from three matches. Bagan, who suffered their second defeat, have one point from three matches.         
	The Sporting Clube de Goa midfield combined well, having the lions share of ball possession. Joseph Pereira and Harmanjot Khabra stitched some nice moves as Sporting built most of their moves on the left to keep their rival defence under pressure.         
	Sporting surged ahead in the 25th minute through Wilton Gomes. Joseph, who kept the rival defence guessing with deceptive crosses, sent a measured cross to medio Wilton Gomes, who headed the ball towards the goal. Bagan defender Mohan Raj shot the ball into his own goal trying to make a clearance, making it 1-0.         
	Bagan lacked the penetration to trouble the rival defence. However, they did manage to create some scoring chances.         
	Jose Ramirez Baretto, who played as the lone striker, was fed with long balls by Lalkamal Bhowmick.         
	The wily striker did get away from his marker on a couple of occasion to create chances for Ishfaq Ahmed and Malsawmtluanga, who failed to capitalise on the chances.         
	Sporting continued to enjoy the upper hand in the second half and increased the lead in the 47th minute through their new Nigerian recruit Nathaniel Amos, who came in place of Joychandra Singh late in the first half.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB formula   is accepted
                                                   CAB formula   is accepted
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The affiliated units of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will each get 13 complimentary passes for the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches at the Eden, an arrangement which the opposition digested for the larger interest.         
	They (the units) will get three Club House and 10 complimentary passes each for the IPL matches, CAB president Prasun Mukherjee said after an informal meeting with the representatives of 121 affiliated units on Wednesday.         
	According to him, 16,800 tickets in total were allotted for the association. However, 8000 of them were returned to the Kolkata Knight Riders franchise-owner, Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd, so that more Club House passes could be bargained for.         
	We have been able to get 335 more Club House passes, taking the figure to 1000, Mukherjee said.         
	The arrangement, according to an opposition member, was hugely disappointing.         
	Obviously, he (Mukherjee) has failed as a negotiator and we had to bear the brunt. We wanted at least 23 Club House passes for each unit This arrangement has been pretty disappointing, the opposition member said.         
	He, however, said most from the rival camp may have to accept it for the larger interest.         
	We have no option but to accept this Otherwise there wouldnt be any match here at all. We want the IPL matches at the Eden and we may digest all this in the larger interest of the game, he said.

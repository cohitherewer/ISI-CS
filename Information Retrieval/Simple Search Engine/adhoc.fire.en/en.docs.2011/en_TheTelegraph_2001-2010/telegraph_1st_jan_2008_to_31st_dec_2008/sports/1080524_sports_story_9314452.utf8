            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders are aiming to end their campaign in the inaugural edition of the IPL on a thumping note against Kings XI Punjab at the Eden on Sunday.         
	The players returned to the city on Friday morning after their match against Delhi DareDevils was washed out at the Kotla on Thursday. It ended their faint hopes of making the semi-finals.         
	Coach John Buchanan, however, arrived in the evening.         
	The players had a gym and pool session at the hotel. They will have nets on Saturday evening.         
	Kings XI Punjab players will arrive on Saturday evening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan looking to extend run
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bagan looking to extend run
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are on a roll. They were headed nowhere at one point of time but are now aiming for the I-League title. When they take on United SC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, the green-and-maroon brigade will be looking to extend their winning run and move closer to league leaders Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	If the city giants obtain full points on Saturday, they will be just a point adrift of Sporting, who are on 22 points.         
	However, Bagans hopes suffered a mild blow when defender N.S. Manju injured his calf muscle at practice on Friday. Since Deepak Mondal and goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee are serving suspensions, coach Karim Bencharifa will have to do without his first-choice defence personnel.         
	Not that he minds. Anand Vasan and Rahul Kumar will play in the defence and Shilton Paul will be in the goal, Bencharifa said on Friday.         
	United SC are also upbeat after defeating Vasco Sports Club 3-1 in their last match. Coach Subrata Bhattacharjee has made it clear that he is in no mood to forget or forgive the Bagan supporters who had heckled him during the Calcutta league. United will miss Dulal Biswas due to suspension, while injury will keep Ayemi Bidemi Daniel out.

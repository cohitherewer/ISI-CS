                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gerrard charged with assault 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Steven Gerrard                           
	Steven Gerrard, the Liverpool and England footballer, has been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray, police have said, after an argument over music being played in a restaurant allegedly escalated into a violent brawl.         
	Gerrard, 28, was charged early on Tuesday morning over the alleged fracas in which Marcus McGee, a company director, lost a tooth and needed four stitches to a head wound.         
	He was released from custody at Southport police station almost two hours earlier after police interviewed him and the other five men, aged between 18 and 33  none of whom are teammates of Gerrard  for most of the day.         
	Meryside police said Gerrard and two other men were charged with ABH and affray.         
	The other three have been bailed pending further inquiries.         
	Inspector Swan, spokesman for Merseyside Police, said in a statement: Merseyside Police have charged Steven Gerrard, 28, of Formby, John Doran, 29, Ian Smith, 19, both of Huyton with Assault causing Actual Bodily Harm and affray following an incident in Bold Street, Southport.         
	All three men will appear at North Sefton magistrates on January 23rd. Three other men who were interviewed over the same incident have been bailed.         
	The charges, under section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act, carry up to five years in jail.         
	Wearing a white t-shirt and smart black trousers, Gerrard attempted to cover his face with his hands before being driven away in a black Citroen Xsara people carrier, believed to be driven by his father.         
	The Liverpool captain had been celebrating Sundays 5-1 win over Newcastle United, in which he scored twice, when a row is said to have broken out involving McGee about the music being played at The Lounge Inn in Southport, Merseyside.         
	Gerrard is understood to have asked McGee, a friend of the restaurants owner, if he could borrow a swipe card which staff must use to operate the music system behind the bar. McGee is said to have refused to provide his card.         
	McGee, 34, a father of two, also suffered cuts to his face and a swollen eye.         
	He declined to talk about the incident as he recovered at his home in Southport, but his mother Patricia said: He was just out for a drink with his partner and I have no idea how he became involved in this.         
	He lost a tooth and the whole family is really shaken up. Im looking after his two little girls at the moment and we just cant believe this has happened.         
	Gerrard, who lives in Formby, Merseyside, is a regular customer at the Lounge Inn, where spots of blood and shards of broken glass could still be seen on the floor on Monday.         
	John Watts, whose daughter Eve had been celebrating her 35th birthday at The Lounge Inn, said Gerrard appeared to be sober and in good spirits shortly before the alleged attack.         
	He said: When Steven Gerrard found out it was my daughters birthday he bought her a bottle of champagne. He seemed in very good spirits. He wasnt drunk at all. He and his party were in a separate room and I believe some of the people who were with him were footballers, though I couldnt name them.         
	Mr Watts, who left the venue 15 minutes before the alleged fight, added: It was a really civilised occasion in a middle-class bar.

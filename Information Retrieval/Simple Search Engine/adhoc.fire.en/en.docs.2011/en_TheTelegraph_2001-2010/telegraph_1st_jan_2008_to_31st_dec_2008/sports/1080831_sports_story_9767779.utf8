The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United go down
                                                                                                                                                                                                     United go down
                      
	Monaco: Uefa Cup holders Zenit St Petersburg became the first Russian team to lift the European Super Cup after beating Champions League winners Manchester United 2-1 on Friday (as briefly reported in Saturdays late city edition).         
	Goals from Pavel Pogrebnyak and record signing Danny, on his debut, gave Zenits Dutch coach Dick Advocaat victory over his old rival Alex Ferguson who was bidding to become the first manager to win the trophy for the third time.         
	Uniteds best moment arrived when defender Nemanja Vidic pulled a goal back 17 minutes from time but Zenit, playing in front of 7,500 of their own fans as well as Chelseas billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich, held on for victory.         
	Pogrebnyak, who missed the Uefa Cup final win over Rangers through suspension, put Zenit in front after 44 minutes when he headed home a flick from Igor Denisov after a well-delivered set-piece by Alejandro Dominguez.         
	Danny, who joined this week in a 30 million euros deal from Dynamo Moscow, doubled the lead after a superb solo run 15 minutes later.         
	Andrei Arshavin helped Zenit control the match for most of the second period.         
	The Russians had the first chance to score when Pogrebnyak skied his shot before a superb free kick by Dominguez flew narrowly wide.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jelena wants to drown her sorrows
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jelena wants to drown her sorrows
                      
	Paris: Jelena Jankovic exited the French Open on Thursday, promising to kill herself, get drunk or do anything that makes me feel better.         
	The third seed was beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 by fellow Serb Ana Ivanovic in a topsy-turvy semi-final.         
	Missing out on a first Grand Slam final and the knowledge that had she won she would have become the new world No.1 was too much for the 23-year-old.         
	Jankovic admitted that she was crying so hard afterwards that she did not want to talk about the match with the assembled media. Asked what she would do to get over the defeat, she responded: Kill myself?         
	No, I will have some dinner and maybe get drunk or do something. I dont know. Whatever makes me feel better.

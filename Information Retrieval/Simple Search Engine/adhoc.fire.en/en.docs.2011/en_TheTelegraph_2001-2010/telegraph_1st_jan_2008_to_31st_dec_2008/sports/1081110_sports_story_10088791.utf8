            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Australia coach Tim Nielsen on Sunday defended captain Ricky Pontings strategy of bowling his part-time bowlers at a time when India were reeling after losing six wickets.         
	My understanding was that we were more than six overs down at the tea break. He was getting regular updates from the umpires through match referee Chris Broad as the day went on, Nielsen said at the customary press conference.         
	That was the decision he made after the tea break with the bowling attack we had.         
	The Australian coach also downplayed the concerns surrounding Pontings chances of possibly being handed a ban for slow over rate in the fourth and final Test. That (ban) is not necessarily an automatic thing as I understand but the captain then is put in a place where he can be suspended. Rick was very aware of that, Nielsen told reporters after the fourth days play.         
	Nielsen said the umpires are yet to speak to the team or the captain regarding the issue.         
	I dont think he was warned as such. Everybody is aware of the consequences of being more than six overs down at the end of the match, he said.         
	The coach also defended his bowlers on slow over rate.         
	We had used our fast bowlers before the tea- break and had some success. The consequence was that we were down in our over rate and had a responsibility to catch that up, he said. Its not as simple as walking back to your marking, turning around, running in. Theres a bit more to it in Test cricket than that. We were 80 runs behind when we started the innings. We knew if India got a run on, it would be a blow our chances if we werent careful.         
	So it was important that both the captain and the bowlers were aware of what they were trying to achieve there.         
	Nielsen expected India to make things more difficult for them on Monday when they chase the target of 382.         
	They have the benefit of being 1-0 up in the series. So they can do what they like. Our challenge is to counter that and make sure we give ourselves the best chance of chasing down the remaining 369 runs more tomorrow, he said.         
	I think you will see India set the challenge of making us do things we are not used to doing or making us play outside of our normal comfort zone to try and score the runs tomorrow.         
	We have to turn up tomorrow with some pretty clear plans about how we are going to go about beating that down if they do it.

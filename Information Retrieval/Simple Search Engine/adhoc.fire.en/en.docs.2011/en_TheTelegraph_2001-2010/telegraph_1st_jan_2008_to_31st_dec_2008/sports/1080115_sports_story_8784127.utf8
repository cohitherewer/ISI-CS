                                                      Hogg wanted Sourav as prime witness

	Perth: The Brad Hogg hearing didnt take place on Monday evening, but if it had, then Sourav Ganguly wouldve been cast in the unusual role of a witness for the Australian!
 
	Sourav was, of course, called to the eighth-floor room at the Hyatt Regency where Mike Procter was to act on the Indians complaint, but he had no clue as to what had been cooking.
 
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Hogg wouldve argued that Sourav hadnt been offended when he called him a b****** at the SCG. So, why did captain Anil Kumble and vice-captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni take such offence?
 
	Sourav, for his part, denied having been abused in that manner. I dont think it went out of hand and I certainly didnt ask Hogg to f*** ** in retaliation hellip; I wasnt told anything and went up only because the manager (Chetan Chauhan) asked me to hellip;
 
	Chauhan, incidentally, also didnt know that Sourav was to have been a prime witness for Hogg.
 
	Sourav, meanwhile, felt better on Monday. If the fever doesnt come back, I should be fit for the third Test, he said.
 
	For Sourav, the day began with a trip to a clinic for a blood test mdash; the report, though, wasnt available till late in the evening. 
 
	Quite sensibly, he skipped nets.

	Motegi (Japan): Danica Patrick made history on Sunday as the first-ever female Indy car winner, taking the Indy Japan 300 race in her 50th start in the series. The American covered 200 laps over the 2.5km twin ring Motegi Oval in 1::51:02.6739, beating Helio Castroneves of Brazil into second and Scott Dixon of New Zealand into third. After three years on the circuit the glamorous brunette was relieved to chalk up a win at last. Finally. This is a long time coming, said Danica, who turned 26 three weeks ago.       
	Totti set for surgery  
	Rome: AS Roma striker Francesco Totti could miss the start of next season after undergoing a knee operation, the club doctor said on Sunday. The 31-year-old, troubled by niggles all season, suffered a cruciate ligament injury in title-chasing Romas 1-1 draw with Livorno on Saturday.  
	Professor Pierpaolo Mariani will perform a surgical operation to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament, Roma club doctor Mario Brozzi said in a statement.         
	Charleston: Fifth seed Serena Wi1lliams, seeking her third WTA title of the year, reached the Family Circle Cup final by beating French teenager Alize Cornet 7-5, 6-3 on Saturday. The American broke her 18-year-old opponent in the eighth game of the second set before holding serve to wrap up victory in one hour and 24 minutes. The 26-year-old Serena next faces ninth seed Vera Zvonareva who upset fellow-Russian Elena Dementieva, the fourth seed, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3.       
	Blake cruises into final  
	Houston: Top seed James Blake cruised into the final of the US Clay Court Championship with a 6-3, 7-6 victory over Spaniard Oscar Hernandez on Saturday. The American world No. 8, seeking his 11th ATP career title but his first on a clay court surface, swept through the opening set before clinching the tie-break in the second 7-3 to wrap up the win in 95 minutes. In the final, Blake will face another Spaniard in Marcel Granollers-Pujol, who came from a set down to beat American Wayne Odesnik 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 in Saturdays first semi-final.

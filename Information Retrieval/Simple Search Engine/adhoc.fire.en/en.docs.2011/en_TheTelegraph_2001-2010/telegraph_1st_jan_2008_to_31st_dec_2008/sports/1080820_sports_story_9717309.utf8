            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sharath Kamal                           
	Beijing: He began a trifle tentatively but Achanta Sharath Kamal eventually settled down to register a 4-2 win over Alfredo Carneros of Spain to move into the second round of mens table tennis at the Beijing Olympics here on Tuesday.         
	The lanky Indian toiled hard against Carneros to win the tactical battle 6-11, 12-10, 11-8, 9-11, 11-6 and 11-7 in 45 minutes.         
	In a regular pattern, Sharath would race to a lead but the Spaniard would catch up, get back into the match and make it quite a struggle for the Indian.         
	Carneros came from behind to win the first game. Then Sharath took a 8-5 lead in the second but the Spaniard caught up with him at 10-10. Sharath finally wrapped up the game with two stinging forehands to level the scores.         
	Sharath clinched the third game but Carneros was not willing to give up yet and trailing 5-8, the Spaniard hit back and won six of the next seven points to level the tally 2-2.         
	Finally Sharath was more in control and sealed the match.         
	In the next round, Sharath faces Chinese-born Austrian Chen Weixing.         
	The match was a little bit tough, yes, admitted Sharath after the win. One reason being that we know each others games very well. (They play for the same club  San Sebastian De Los Reyes in Madrid  and in fact stay in the same apartment too).         
	So it was more of a mental battle, on how to counterattack The trick was to outthink each other. It was more of a battle of wits than anything else.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mittal to sell CSKA Sofia
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mittal to sell CSKA Sofia
                      
	New Delhi: Indian businessman Pramod Mittal has signed a preliminary agreement for sale of debt-ridden club CSKA Sofia to Bulgarian company Titan.         
	No financial details of the deal, which is to be finalised in the next two months, were made available but the Bulgarian champion club confirmed the development.         
	This is a Christmas present for all those who love CSKA, the website of the financially troubled CSKA said.         
	The contract was signed in the presence of the owners of Titan, a waste disposal company, and a representative of club-owner Pramod, brother of steel magnate Laxmi Mittal.         
	The purpose of this contract is to guarantee full exclusivity during the long technical procedure of transferring ownership, Nikolay Ishkov, representative of Titan, was quoted as saying by a Bulgarian news agency.         
	We want to have assurances there will not be any negotiations with other buyers, or any deals with respect to ownership, he added.         
	In June, Uefa refused to renew CSKAs licence due to unpaid fees thus eliminating the club from participation in the Champions League.         
	CSKA, 31-time Bulgarian champions, faced a series of financial problems after Pramod Mittal bought the club two years ago.         
	The club sold several players last year in a bid to cushion debts. (PTI)

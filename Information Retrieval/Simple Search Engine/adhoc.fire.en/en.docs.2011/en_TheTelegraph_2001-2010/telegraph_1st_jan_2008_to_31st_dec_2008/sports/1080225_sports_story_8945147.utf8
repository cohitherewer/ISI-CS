                                                     India lose a thriller by 18 runs
                  Brett Lee exults after dismissing Sachin Tendulkar at the SCG on Sunday                     
	Sydney: Ricky Ponting scored a brilliant century and Adam Gilchrist claimed a record-equalling six dismissals as Australia beat India by 18 runs in an absorbing tri-series one-day International on Sunday.         
	Ponting ended a lean run with the bat to score 124 off 133 balls and guide the world champions to a daunting 317 for seven at the SCG.         
	Allrounder Andrew Symonds, who had also been struggling, hit an unbeaten 59 while opener Matthew Hayden chipped in with a 54 after Ponting elected to bat first.         
	Ponting had managed only 64 runs in his previous six innings.         
	The Australian skipper registered his 26th one-day hundred, overtaking Sri Lankas Sanath Jayasuriya into second place on the all-time list, behind Indias Tendulkar (41).         
	Ponting also become only the fifth player to score over 11,000 one-day runs before he threw his wicket away in the penultimate over, caught in the deep by Irfan Pathan.         
	The Aussie skipper was given an ovation all the way to the dressing room by the entire Indian team.         
	Gilchrist held five catches and completed a stumping to equal the world record for the most dismissals in a match by a wicketkeeper which he shares with four other players and has achieved on five previous occasions.

                                                     At the Waca, its more about mental adjustment: Kumble

 - Its a good sign that we wont have to encounter Hayden early on, says India captain 
        Anil Kumble
   
	The Team India captain, Anil Kumble, also had a Q amp;A session at the Waca. Later, he briefly spoke to The Telegraph.
 
	The following are excerpts
 
	On the importance of the third Test
 
	We need to play good cricket to get the right result and come back in the series hellip; To keep the series alive, we do need a good beginning.
 
	On whether hes relieved that the in-form Matthew Hayden wont be playing at the Waca
 
	Hes been in fantastic form at the top of the order, so in that sense, yes hellip; But wed always like to play the best team hellip; Im sure Chris Rogers is a capable batsman, but its a good sign that we wont have to encounter Hayden early on hellip;
 
	On Rogers, wholl be making his debut
 
	We saw him in Canberra last week (where he scored 60 and 17) hellip; Weve got plans for him.
 
	On the Australians wanting to rattle Team India with an all-pace attack
 
	I think we handled the bowling pretty well in Sydney hellip; The pitch could be different here, but weve got quality batsmen to handle the Australian attack hellip; Its important to put runs on the board and Im confident well be able to do that.
 
	On the Wacas reputation
 
	There could be extra pace and bounce, but weve got the quality and the experience to handle the conditions hellip; It probably takes some time getting used to it and, more than anything else, the adjustment is in the mind. I think people are used to making that adjustment.
 
	On his wicket-specific message to the batsmen
 
	That no matter what the conditions, the batters still have to take it one ball at a time hellip; It still is cricket and one must play normally.
 
	On the batting order with Virender Sehwag opening
 
	Well go back to the old order, with Rahul (Dravid) at No.3 hellip;
 
	On Sachin Tendulkar being the only one to have played a Test at the Waca
 
	His experience and skills will be of help and he can talk to the batters hellip; Having said that, three have played at least 80 Tests, with two of them having played more than 100 hellip; Theyre capable of handling the conditions and, as Ive pointed out, its more an adjustment in the mind.
 
	On consultant Gary Kirstens presence
 
	He definitely brings a new perspective hellip; He was a great opener and has played here before hellip; Hes been passing on tips. Its good to have Gary around.
 
	On the pre-series agreement on taking the fielders word for low catches being scrapped
 
	Im happy hellip; Its best left to the umpires. After the last Test (at the SCG), Id mentioned it would be reviewed.
 
	On whether that will put the umpires under more pressure
 
	I dont think so hellip; Cricket is a professional sport and everybody is under pressure hellip; Under equal pressure hellip; In fact, we players have always been under tremendous pressure to perform hellip; Eventually, its about the way individuals handle pressure situations hellip;
 
	On the wind factor (the Fremantle Doc) at the Waca
 
	Yes, thats been discussed hellip; I may have to end up bowling a lot against the breeze hellip; Its a bit unusual for us as we dont get this phenomenon back home hellip; However, weve got young bowlers who can lift their game and ensure that they dont get affected.
 
	On his statement at the SCG that only one team played the second Test in the right spirit
 
	Weve decided to move on and Im sure both teams will put up a good show and this Test will be remembered for the quality of its cricket hellip; What happened in Sydney has been left behind.
 
	On his thoughts on the morning-after the session with counterpart Ricky Ponting and Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle
 
	Im definitely more relaxed hellip; Instead of other issues, I can now wholly focus on the job at hand hellip;
 
	Finally, on being one wicket away from 600 in Tests
 
	(Laughs) Hopefully, Ill get that in the first innings hellip; It will be nice to get that 600th wicket hellip; Thats it hellip; Once I get there, Ill definitely have to address you all hellip; At this point, its important for us to go out there and play the best possible cricket hellip; Im not thinking of the 600th wicket.

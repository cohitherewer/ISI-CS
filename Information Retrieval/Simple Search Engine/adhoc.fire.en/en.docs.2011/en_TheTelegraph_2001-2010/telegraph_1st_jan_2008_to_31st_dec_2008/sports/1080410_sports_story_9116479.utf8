The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shiv tells Monty to shut up
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shiv tells Monty to shut up
                      
	New Delhi: Colin Montgomerie should zip his mouth and play well enough to qualify for the US Masters instead of sulking over the inclusion Asian players in the golf major, says Shiv Kapur.         
	Montgomerie, who failed to finish among the top 50 and thus missed out being able to play in the first major of the year, was furious after three lower ranked Asian players, including Jeev Milkha Singh, were given special invitations.         
	The Scot said he believed commercial interests drove organisers to invite the trio, which includes Liang Wen-chong and Prayad Marksaeng.         
	Not amused by Montgomeries rant, Shiv said: Its a clear case of sour grapes. Monty should zip his mouth and focus on his own game. He should try to qualify for the major, instead of blaming players like Jeev.         
	Shiv, an Asian Games gold medallist, said that Jeev had done more for Indian golf than the Scot, considered one of the best players never to have won a major, ever had for his country.         
	Jeev has done a lot for the game in the country. I can say that I am what I am because of players like him. Can you tell me what he has done for Scotland? Shiv asked.         
	He also reckons that Jeev stands a good chance of notching up a decent finish at his second successive Masters appearance.         
	His chances are bright even though it all boils down to how you play over the four days. Your game has to click at the right time. After all, everyone walks out to win, he said.         
	Shiv was speaking on the sidelines of the launch of a new programme for juniors, GolfRiTe, on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nerves were put to test and Im glad I came out on top: Atwal
                                                   Nerves were put to test and Im glad I came out on top: Atwal
    - Mentally tougher pro is relieved at ending five-year title drought             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Exactly four weeks after Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasias monumental win in the Indian Masters, another Royal tiger  Arjun Atwal  made a big killing and regained the Malaysian Open title.         
	A short while later, Atwal (the only Indian to have got a PGA Tour Card) spoke to The Telegraph, first from his cellphone and then his room at the One World Hotel. He was, quite clearly, over the moon.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Emotions on winning his first title after 2003 (when he won the Malaysian Open and the Hero Honda Masters)         
	Theres relief, obviously, but other than that I cant describe things... I cant really put it in words... Right now, Im not thinking too much. Dont want to, really.         
	Thoughts going into the last round, placed tied 11th with three others         
	Look, I was seven shots off the leader and, so, wasnt thinking of anything much... Of course, as the day progressed, I began doing well and thought a round of 64 could do the trick... It actually worked out that way, but I must confess to having been nervous in the play-off (against holder Peter Hedblom of Sweden)... My nerves were put to test and Im glad I came out on top.         
	Significance of Sundays win         
	Means everything... Its a step towards trying to get back the PGA Tour Card... I dont know when that will happen, but I hope its going to be soon.         
	Dedicating the title         
	Hmmm... To my sons Krishen (who is three-and-a-half) and Shiva (three months old), who is fresh out of the oven! This is my first win after their birth, so its got to be for them.         
	Next tournament         
	(Laughs) Dont know! I first want this achievement to sink in... After all, the last trophy was five years ago... What I do know is that Im coming to New Delhi for a day tomorrow, to pick up my wife (Sona) and kids. Ill then head back to Florida.         
	On the five-year drought         
	Difficult to say why I wasnt winning... Golf is such a sport where you could be playing well and still not getting the trophies... But, yes, I worked hard in the off-season (last November to January) and that paid off... Did a lot of physical training Plus, for the past fortnight or so, my mind has been a lot freer after being cleared of the charge (of vehicular homicide)...         
	Last Marchs high-speed crash, which proved fatal for the other driver, in Florida         
	The proceedings did affect me... It was a time when my mental toughness got tested... I wanted to quit the sport each time that I played badly, but Im thankful to my wife for encouraging me to fight on... Its more her belief in my abilities which made me continue. Shed say that I was just being tested for everything.         
	Mental toughness         
	Plays a huge role... Today, Im a lot tougher than I was a couple of years back... Its this mental toughness which helped in the play-off.         
	Becoming the second golfer (after Chowrasia) with roots in Calcutta to win a European Tour event in a matter of weeks         
	(Laughs again) Great for Calcutta, isnt it? SSP, in fact, is right next to me in my room... Well probably go down to the bar after Ive finished talking to you.         
	[Chowrasia, who came on the phone, said: Bahut hi khushi ki baat hai... Arjun played very well and Indian golf is definitely on the rise... Golf pe ab jyada dhyan rahega]         
	Significance of Indian winners on the circuit         
	Definitely good... It will, hopefully, lead to less of cricket and cricket everywhere... Sponsorship is there in golf, but its a slow process... Its encouraging when, for example, a Johnnie Walker event is held in India Id like things to move faster, though.         
	On the bonding between Indian golfers         
	Very good... For a long time, I was on a different Tour, but Id follow the Indians progress either on the net or on the TV... Were happy for each other... We cheer for each other...         
	Finally, the Indian colts having won the U-19 cricket World Cup there exactly a week ago         
	Yes, Id read about it... It has certainly been a good time for Indian sportsmen in Malaysia... Dont forget, in recent years at least, I started it all by winning the Open in 2003.         
	Footnote: While Atwals parents, Bindi and Rupi, planned to host the whole of Delhi Golf Club in the capital, the Royal here was raising a toast too. Another feather in our cap, remarked former Royal captain Ashit Luthra.

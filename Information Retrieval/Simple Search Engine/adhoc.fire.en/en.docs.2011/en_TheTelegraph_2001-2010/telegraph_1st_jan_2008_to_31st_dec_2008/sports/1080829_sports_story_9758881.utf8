                                                                                                                                                                                           Monika Devi: SAI action mala fide
                      
	New Delhi: Weightlifter Monika Devi has termed the actions of the Sports Authority of India (SAI) as unreasonable and mala fide and alleged that she failed to go to Beijing Olympics because of the deliberate lapse on the part of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).         
	In a petition submitted to T.S. Krishnamurthy, appointed by the sports ministry to inquire into the scandal, she blamed SAI for the controversy.         
	If the report (dope test) was at all positive, why did SAI not inform the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) 48-72 hours prior to the departure as required under the provisions of World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)? she questioned. (PTI)

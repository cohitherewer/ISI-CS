The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Womens qualifiers shifted to SA
                                                Womens qualifiers shifted to SA
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Womens World Cup qualifying event, which was to be held in Lahore from February 18-24, has been shifted to South Africa, ICC announced on Tuesday. The decision was arrived at following independent security reports and extensive discussions by ICC management and the ICC Womens Committee.         
	The ICC said in a statement that the event would be staged in conjunction with Cricket South Africa and the Boland Cricket Union in the Stellenbosch district of the Western Cape on the same dates.         
	The tournament was originally to take place in Lahore last November but was postponed for security reasons until after the proposed election date of January 8.         
	But with the rescheduling of the elections for February 18, the decision was made to move the event to South Africa.         
	ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said: It is unfortunate that the timing of the event ended up clashing with the elections, forcing us to change the venue... Sadly, events beyond the control of the ICC and the PCB have conspired against us on this occasion.         
	The safety of all participants is our number one priority and on the basis of the independent advice we have received  as well as the concerns expressed by many of the participating countries  we concluded it was not appropriate to stage the tournament (in Lahore) at this time.         
	The ICC Womens World Cup will be held in Australia in 2009.

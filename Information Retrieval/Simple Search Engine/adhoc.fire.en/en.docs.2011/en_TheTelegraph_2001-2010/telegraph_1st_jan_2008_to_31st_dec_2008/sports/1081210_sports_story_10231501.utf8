                                                                                                                                                                                                     Md. Sp. have slim chance
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In two crucial group B encounters in the 30th Federation Cup on Wednesday, Mohammedan Sporting will take on Mahindra United while HAL will face Churchill Brothers.         
	With two defeats in a row, HAL are out of contention but the other three sides are still in with a chance.         
	Mahindra and Churchill have four points each. If both win, then the team with the better goal difference would advance.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, with three points, still have an outside chance, but a win alone wont suffice for them.         
	HAL will have to defeat Churchill to send Mohammedan Sporting to the semis.

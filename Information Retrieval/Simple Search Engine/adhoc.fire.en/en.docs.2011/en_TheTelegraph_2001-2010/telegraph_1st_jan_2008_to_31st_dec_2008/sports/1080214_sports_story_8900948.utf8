The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant is probably the best in world: Srinath
                                                     Ishant is probably the best in world: Srinath
                  Ishant Sharma                     
	Mangalore: Ishant Sharma outshone even Brett Lee in Australia and going by his current form, the lanky Delhi speedster is now probably the best bowler around, believes former India spearhead Jawagal Srinath.         
	Ishant is more than a promising prospect for the country. Right now, he is probably the best bowler in the world, Srinath said here on Wednesday.         
	The former pacer went on to say that Ishant looked even better than Lee.         
	Overall, Srinath was happy with the current Indian attack and felt his former new ball colleague and bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad has made a huge difference.         
	Srinath said both Irfan Pathan and R.P. Singh have been doing a good job of late and urged to refrain from asking Sreesanth to cut down on his aggression.         
	We have to leave him as aggressive as he is. If it goes, he will lose his sting, Srinath said.         
	On Rohit Sharmas batting against Sri Lanka on Tuesday, Srinath said it was superb.         
	He is a great batting potential and has a tremendous technique, Srinath said.         
	The former player, who was here to lay the foundation of Manipal Universitys indoor sports complex, also stressed on the need for a sports medicine centre.         
	There is an urgent need for a sophisticated, full-fledged sports medicine centre, he said.         
	There should be a sports medicine complex on the lines of the one in South Africa. At present there is no such centre and players have to go abroad for treatment of any kind of sports-related injuries, Srinath said.         
	Recalling his experience, Srinath said in 1996 he had to go to South Africa for his ligament treatment while Sachin Tendulkar had to rush to England for back injury, he said.         
	Sports medicine centre is the need of the hour and universities should take the initiative to start courses on that, he said.         
	Srinaths observation on Ishants capability as a bowler has turned out to be true as in January this year, the former India quick said the Delhi boy would develop into a top bowler.         
	At the moment, he lacks experience. Thats obvious, Srinath had said.         
	In the next two years I can see him bowling at a pace of 140 to 145 kilometres per hour.           (AGENCIES)

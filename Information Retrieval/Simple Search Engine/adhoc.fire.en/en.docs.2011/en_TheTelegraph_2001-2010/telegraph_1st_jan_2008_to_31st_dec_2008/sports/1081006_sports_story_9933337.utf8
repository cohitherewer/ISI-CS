The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin tops Warnes list of best in Tests 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sachin tops Warnes list of best in Tests 
                  Sachin Tendulkar                     
	London: Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar tops the list of worlds best 100 Test cricketers named by legendary spinner Shane Warne in his book Shane Warnes century, which also features as many as 10 other Indians.         
	Warnes list of cricketers whom he had played with or against also includes Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Harbhajan Singh, Virender Sehwag, Anil Kumble, Kapil Dev, Mohammed Azharuddin, Dilip Vengsarkar and Ravi Shastri.         
	The list in Warnes book released on October 2 is almost identical with the one The Times published last year. The legendary spinner describes Tendulkar as a genius and best in the business  one who has an amazing discipline  and puts the Indian ahead of Brian Lara.         
	Tendulkar has a touch of genius about him. He is the best in the business. Being quick and decisive means that he either goes all the way forward or back on the crease, but doesnt get caught in two minds.         
	I have found it difficult at times to deceive him because he reads the length and the spin so quickly, said Warne of Tendulkar in the book.         
	Sourav, who is in the Indian Test squad to play against Australia in the four-Test series starting on October 9, features in the 96th spot of Warnes list.         
	Warne shared a love and hate relationship with Sourav. The two have had a few run-ins, the latest being during the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League, where they involved in a war of words and were both fined 10 per cent of their match fees.         
	Still, Warne considers Sourav as an intelligent cricketer with interesting ideas on all subjects and one who has his own way of doing things.         
	But he did have the knack of rubbing up opponents (and even teammates when he went to Lancashire) the wrong way without seeming to try very hard. If this was part of a deliberate strategy, then he got it bang on at times.         
	He would also be late for the toss and then walk off on his own without waiting for Steve Waugh, our captain, Warne wrote of Sourav in his book.           (PTI)

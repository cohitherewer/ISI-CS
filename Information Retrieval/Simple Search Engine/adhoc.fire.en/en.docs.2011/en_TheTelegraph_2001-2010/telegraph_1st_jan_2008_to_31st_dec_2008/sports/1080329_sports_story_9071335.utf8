                                                   Gibbs held for drink driving
                      
	Cape Town: South African opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs was arrested in the early hours on Friday for drink-driving in Cape Town, according to reports.         
	Police superintendent Billy Jones confirmed that a 34-year-old cricketer had been arrested at 1:45 am (South Africa time) near Cape Towns seafront, but said we are not at liberty to implicate people by name until they have appeared in a court of law.         
	Jones said the man, reported by the SAPA news agency and state SABC radio as being Herschelle Gibbs, was pulled over for speeding. A breathalyser test was conducted within the prescribed time and he was detained at 3:45am at the Sea Point police station, he said.         
	Gibbs was released on a $62 bail and would appear in Cape Town magistrates court on June 27. The South African, who was left out of the Test squad currently on tour in India but remains a regular in the one-day team, plays for the Cape Town-based Cobras franchise.

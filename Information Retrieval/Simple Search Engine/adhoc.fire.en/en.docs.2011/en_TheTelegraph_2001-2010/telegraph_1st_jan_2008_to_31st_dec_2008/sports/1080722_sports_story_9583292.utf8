The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mendis not the only threat, says Dravid
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mendis not the only threat, says Dravid
                  Rahul Dravid cools off during practice in Colombo   on Monday                           
	Colombo: The Sri Lankan attack is not all about Ajantha Mendis and it would be fatal to focus only on the mystery spinner ignoring others, warns former Team India captain Rahul Dravid.         
	Talking to reporters ahead of the first Test which gets underway here on Wednesday, Dravid did not doubt the threat Mendis can pose to his teammates but said it would be a folly to underestimate old warhorses Muttiah Muralidharan and Chaminda Vaas.         
	Sure, Mendis is going to be one of their four or five bowlers, but you cannot just focus on him, Dravid said.         
	They have got a couple of other guys (Muralidharan and Vaas) who have got 1000 wickets between them, he said.         
	It will be a mistake to focus just on Mendis. We will just play it as we see it. We have come against a lot of bowlers in our times and we have succeeded against them, said Dravid, oozing confidence that the visitors would read the freak spinner, who recently ran through Indias ODI squad in the Asia Cup final.         
	According to Dravid, though the Lankan attack would miss Lasith Malinga, Ferveez Maharoof and Dilhara Fernando owing to injuries, its still a potent attack.         
	They have got the right balance in these conditions. They are always a big threat at home. Muttiah Muralidharan is a big impact and Chaminda Vaas is a clever bowler in these conditions, Dravid said.         
	Sri lanka also has a formidable batting line-up and that should make the series interesting, reckons Dravid.         
	They have a good batting line-up that adapts well in these conditions. They can bat for long periods. But we have come here with a good team as well. If we play to our potential, I think it will be a good test series, he said.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, just 172 runs short of Brian Laras world record of 11,953 Test runs, would remain the cynosure of all eyes in the series but Dravid insisted the team would maintain its focus on winning the series.         
	There has been no talk in the dressing-room of the record or anything like that. We are focused on winning the series and so is Sachin.         
	I hope he achieves the landmark here. We are hoping it is in the first innings of the first Test on the first day itself, so we can have a big celebration, he said. Its obviously a great achievement for him and the team when he eventually gets there, he added.

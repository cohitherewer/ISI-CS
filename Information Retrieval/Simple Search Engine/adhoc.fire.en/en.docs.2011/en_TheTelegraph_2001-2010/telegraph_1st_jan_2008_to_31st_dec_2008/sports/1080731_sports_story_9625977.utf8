  AFC Challenge Cup - Climaxs 92nd-minute goal saves the blushes                Bhaichung Bhutia is challenged by an Afghanistan defender on Wednesday. (PTI)                     
	Hyderabad: An injury-time goal by Climax Lawrence saw a patchy India scrape past minnows Afghanistan in their opening Group A match of the AFC Challenge Cup on Wednesday.         
	Climax saved the day for India, scoring in the 92nd minute after being fed by substitute Clifford Miranda, to the relief of the Indian camp and the handful of spectators who turned up at the floodlit Gachibowli stadium.         
	India, however, failed to live up to the pre-tournament hype and they have to dish out a much improved performance in their two remaining matches  against Tajikistan and Turkmenistan to harbour hopes of winning the eight-nation tournament and qualify for the 2011 Asian Cup after 24 years.         
	India completely dominated the first 25 minutes having most of the ball possession and making several attacks. It seemed for a while that Bob Houghtons charges would walk away with full points without much resistance from their opponents, the lowest ranked side in the tournament at 181st in the latest Fifa charts. But the fight by the players from the war-ravaged country left the Indians surprised as well as red-faced.         
	The Afghans, who had two players in their ranks who ply their trade in lower division clubs in Germany, almost turned the tables towards the breather, getting two fine chances with the hosts surviving, thanks to Subrata Pauls brilliant goalkeeping.         
	While the Indians failed to produce the finishing touch even after stitching together a number of attacks, the Afghans employed tight man marking inside their own half and Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia was given little space by Djelaluddin Shrityar, one of the two Afghan players who play in Germany.         
	India had at least three attempts on the rival goal. First in the fifth minute, it was captain Bhaichung whose header beat the goalkeeper but missed the target by inches.         
	Next, in the 10th minute, N.P. Pradeep could not do more than poke his toe off a Bhaichung pass that ballooned over the head of an onrushing Afghan goalkeeper Shamsuddin Amiri. A few seconds later, home team striker Sunil Chhetris shot from outside the box went straight to the goalkeeper.         
	Chhetri again failed to connect to a Lawrence cross from near the right touchline in the 19th minute.         
	Four minutes later, a looping shot by Bungo Singh, who was fielded in place of the injured Steven Dias, was fisted away in time by a busy Afghan goalkeeper Shamsuddin.         
	Bhaichungs back-heel attempt from the resultant corner, after being fed by defender Anwar Ali, was again blocked by the rival goalkeeper.         
	The Afghans though slowly found their feet and started finding space in the Indian half with their strikers Abdul Saboor and Qadami Hafizullah looking dangerous and their midfielders feeding them well.         
	In the 26th minute, the home supporters were nearly stunned with Afghan striker Hafizullah sending a left footer towards the Indian goal but Subrata Paul was up to the task, punching away in time, diving high on his right.         
	In the 42nd minute, India were saved from conceding the lead, following a move from the right flank. Hafizullahs low drive was saved by Paul who got his hands on the ball, just in time.         
	The second half was a midfield tussle with few clear chances and India pressing hard for the lead but failing to find the finishing touches.         
	In the 67th minute, Bhaichungs misdirected shot from outside the box flew foots above the bar and a Chhetri shot two minutes later also missed the target.         
	Bhaichung then missed the easiest chance of the day in the 78th minute. After the Afghan goalkeeper dropped the ball in front of the India captain following a charge by Chhetri, the Sikkimese sniper only had to fire into the empty goal but he chose to shoot a grounder only to get deflected from a defender.         
	India were finally saved the blushes by Climax, who after being fed by Clifford Miranda, a substitute of Bungo Singh in the 75th minute, fired a waist-high shot past the Afghan goalkeeper, following a move by Chhetri, to the dismay of the Afghans.         
	The Afghans had fought hard for the 90 minutes without giving an inch to their more fancied rivals and they ended the game with their heads held high.         
	Indias injury concerns, though, compounded with Deepak Mondal limping out of the ground towards the close of the match and was replaced by Mahesh Gawli.         
	 Incidentally, the coach had said on Tuesday that Gawli would not be fit for Wednesdays match.

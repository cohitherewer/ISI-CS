	Stockholm: Form continued to elude Sania Mirza and the Indian ace crashed out of the Nordea Nordic Light Open with a gruelling three-set loss to Czech Iveta Benesova in the second round.         
	In an over two-hour contest, Benesova rallied to beat the sixth- seeded Sania 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday.         
	The win not just ensured the 25-year-old Czech a berth in the quarterfinals of the $145,000 tier IV hard-court event but also took her win-loss career record against the Indian to 3-0.

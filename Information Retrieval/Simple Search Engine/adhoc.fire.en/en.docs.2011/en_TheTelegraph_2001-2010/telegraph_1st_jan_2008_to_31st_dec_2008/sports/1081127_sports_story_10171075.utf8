                                                                                                                                                                                                       Symonds apologises for brawl
            A STAFF REPORTER            Symonds                           
	Calcutta: Andrew Symonds has apologised to teammates on Wednesday for the pub brawl fiasco and for putting them through this distraction and regretted his decision to visit the hotel.         
	As is well known, I met friends at Brisbanes Normanby Hotel, near the Australian cricket team hotel, on Sunday after the Test finished.         
	I maintain that I acted appropriately while at the hotel, but I regret making the decision to visit the hotel as I realise I put myself in a compromising position, Symonds said in a statement released by Cricket Australia.         
	I have told my teammates that I am sorry to have put them through this distraction at a time when they are trying to prepare for a Test match so soon after the Brisbane game, particularly those who were also at the hotel and were named in media reports, he added.         
	Symonds said he was still going through counselling sessions and promised to come out a better person.         
	I have been and am still going through a counselling process and I give my teammates, Cricket Australia and Australian cricket fans a commitment that I will continue the counselling work which, as I have already said publicly, is something I want to use to help me understand how and why I behave so I can be a better person, he said.         
	It is something I have enjoyed in the last few months, and it is something with which I am making progress, but it is a work in progress, he added.         
	Symonds reiterated that he has learnt his lesson and vowed to translate his words into action.         
	I have learnt a valuable lesson from this incident and I know that actions speak louder than words and thats how I will be judged, he added.         
	Symonds had been given clean chit by the investigating team of CA that was probing his involvement in his altercation at a Brisbane pub.         
	Symonds had met CA chief executive James Sutherland and captain Ricky Ponting to discuss his involvement where he insisted on his innocence.         
	Sutherland accepted his version and decided not to terminate his contract and had let him off after a warning.

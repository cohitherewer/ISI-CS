The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pironkova shuts out Ivanovic
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pironkova shuts out Ivanovic
                      
	Rome: Top seed Ana Ivanovic crashed out of the Italian Open in her first game on Wednesday, losing 4-6, 7-5, 2-6 to Bulgarian qualifier Tsvetana Pironkova.         
	Former world No. 1 Venus Williams beat Australian Samantha Stosur 6-4, 6-1 in a game postponed from Tuesday because of rain to join Pironkova in the third round.         
	Serbias Ivanovic made an untidy start with too many groundstrokes finding the net or going long and she soon went down a break, but she broke back in the ninth game only to fail to hold immediately after and concede the set.         
	The world No. 3 twice surrendered a break advantage in the second set and let a string chances to take the Bulgarians serve again go begging before she finally managed to level things up.         
	But the unforced errors kept flowing and she was broken three times on the way to losing the decider.         
	Ivanovic missed this tournament the last two years due to injuries. At the German Open last week, Ivanovic lost to Elena Dementieva in the semi-finals.         
	In first-round play, Maria Kirilenko rallied to beat 18th-seeded Nadia Petrova 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 in a match that began on Tuesday but was stopped due to rain with Kirilenko ahead 2-1 in the third set. In another match, Ekaterina Makarova upset 13th-seeded Nicole Vaidisova 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.

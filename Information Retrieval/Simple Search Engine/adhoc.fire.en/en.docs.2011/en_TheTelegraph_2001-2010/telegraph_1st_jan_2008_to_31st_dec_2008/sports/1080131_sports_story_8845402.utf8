                                                   Yuvraj ruled out of 1st ODI

           
	Adelaide: Yuvraj Singh will stay put in Australia and is set to be available for the tri-series from the second one-day Internationals onwards. 
    
	Yuvraj was miserably out of form in the Test series and was left out of the third match after he injured his knee in a practice session. Though Yuvraj has been declared fit by physio John Gloster but he is reluctant to test himself out in the first ODI against Australia in Brisbane on February 3. 
    
	The dashing right-hander who is also the vice-captain in ODIs, is surely ruled out of the Twenty20 match in Melbourne on Friday.

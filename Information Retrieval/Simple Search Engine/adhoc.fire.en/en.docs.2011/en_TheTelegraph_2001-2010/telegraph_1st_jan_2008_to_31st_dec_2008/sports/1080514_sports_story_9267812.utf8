                                                                                                                                                                                                     If taken positively, pressure can help you perform better: Ishant
    - Kolkata Knight Riders pacer on a terrific season             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                          
	Calcutta: In recent years, few players have made as big an impact as young Ishant Sharma in their first season of international cricket. The 19-year-old, who is a part of a bada joint family in New Delhis Patel Nagar, is clearly headed for big things.         
	That Ishant, who is turning out for Shah Rukh Khans Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL is actually quite simple, came through during his one-on-one with The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	What drew him to cricket and not, say, basketball         
	Im thankful to an uncle of mine, Balwinder Singh, who has played for Railways, for encouraging me He convinced me that I was good at bowling quick and that I should continue to work hard and improve I didnt think of playing some other sport.         
	His hero         
	Glenn McGrath I couldnt interact with him in Australia. Hopefully, though, Ill be able to speak to him during the IPL.         
	The 2007-08 season having been terrific         
	The past six months have been great, but I dont think Ive changed as a bowler from the time I made my comeback in Bangalore (third and final Test against Pakistan) The only difference is that Im more confident now.         
	Handling the expectations-driven pressure         
	I cant do anything about the expectations Woh mere haath mein nahin hai Bowling in the right areas is in my hands and Im just focusing on that. Some pressure is bound to be there and, so, its probably about how you handle it If taken positively, pressure can help you perform better Im taking it positively.         
	His own expectations         
	I aim to land the ball in good areas I must confess theres acute disappointment if I cant Dukh hota hai.         
	What he learnt the most in Australia         
	The long tour actually helped me understand myself as a bowler a lot better Earlier, Id think that my No.1 strength was the inswinger, but during the tour, I realised pace was a top strength. The bounce I could generate because of my height too.         
	Having torn holes in Ricky Pontings reputation         
	(Laughs) I quickly realised that reputations dont matter That the ball was a weapon in my hands and I had to use it well I wouldnt call him my bunny Things went well for me in Australia Mera time accha tha.         
	Thoughts when the team touched down in Australia         
	I knew it was a long tour Didnt know what awaited me, but was determined to do well and to learn from exposure to conditions so different from home.         
	The wicket which gave him the most satisfaction         
	Getting (Matthew) Hayden in the first innings of the Adelaide Test I clean bowled him Having got a hundred, hed been well settled         
	Being timed at over 150kmph during the tour         
	Main khush hua Ashish Nehra had also bowled at over 150 in the 2003 World Cup Pace is important.         
	Whether, because hes only 19, hes concerned about injuries         
	Ill have to keep training, whether I play or not The more regularly I train, at this stage when my body is still developing, the better.         
	Twenty20 being more challenging for the bowlers         
	It is, thats for sure Theres no time to think afresh You cant really plan the deliveries that you want to bowl         
	Unwinding         
	I enjoy the company of close friends Being in their company helps me switch off I also like listening to songs The ones in Punjabi Some of the newer singers (in Hindi) as well.         
	Being interested in soccer         
	(Excitedly) Absolutely Im a big Man U fan Among footballers, I quite like Ronaldinhos style.         
	Finally, on being picked by Shoaib Akhtar as the most promising young quick around         
	Im happy.

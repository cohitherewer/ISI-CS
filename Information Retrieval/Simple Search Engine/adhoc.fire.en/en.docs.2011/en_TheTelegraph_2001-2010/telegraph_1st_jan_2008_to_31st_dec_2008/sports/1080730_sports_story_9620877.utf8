The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle puts in his papers
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gayle puts in his papers
                  Chris Gayle                     
	Port-of-Spain: Chris Gayle has resigned as the captain of the West Indies cricket team, according to West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) CEO Donald Peters, who is also speculated to be sent on leave, indicating uncertain times for the board ahead of the Champions Trophy.         
	CEO Dr Donald Peters confirmed that West Indies captain Chris Gayle had indeed formally tendered his resignation as skipper on Saturday night by letter, a local daily reported.         
	He, however, did not give details as to Gayles reasons, it added.         
	Gayle was reportedly unhappy with the WICB selection policy and voiced concerns over the regional selectors choices in the recent ODI series against Australia after the Windies had surrendered the decisive third match.         
	Meanwhile, the Caribbean Media Corporation claimed that Peters had been sent on unspecified, administrative leave immediately, and corporate secretary Tony Deyal, was said to be dismissed as the outcome of an emergency internal investigation into information leaks from within the board concerning funding for WICB president Julian Huntes office.         
	But Peters said he had received no communication in this regard.         
	We have been hearing that. But no, that has not been communicated to me, and there is no reason to believe that there is any such (decision), he was quoted as saying by the paper.         
	Deyal, on his part, said I have asked the board to clarify it, and the board hasnt said anything.         
	Nobody has confirmed or denied it. There is no reason (given for dismissal). One would think there must be, but I was never asked to respond (to any such issue)...           (PTI)

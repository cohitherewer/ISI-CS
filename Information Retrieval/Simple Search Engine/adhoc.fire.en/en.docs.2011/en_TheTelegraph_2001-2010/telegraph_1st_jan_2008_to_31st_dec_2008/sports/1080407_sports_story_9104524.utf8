	Manama: Giancarlo Fisichella outpaced Lewis Hamilton to finish 12th as Force India notched up their first double finish of the season in the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday.         
	Starting 18th on the grid, three-time race winner Fisichella proved why he is considered such a high-quality driver and the Italian came up with a sublime show to finish 12th, ahead of, among others, McLarens Lewis Hamilton, who finished 13th, Williamss Kazuki Nakazima, Toro Rossos Sebastien Bourdais and Red Bulls David Coulthard.         
	Teammate Sutil, however, was involved in an opening lap mess and had to pit his car after its front had been damaged.         
	The German would still be happy with his 19th place, especially after failing to finish in Melbourne and Sepang.         
	Force India owner Vijay Mallya was naturally elated with the double finish and asserted that the team had shown its potential as a true midfield team.         
	Reliability was the priority and the double finish has vindicated us, Mallya said.         
	The idea was to bring both the cars home and we achieved just that. Giancarlo finished ahead of the McLaren, Williams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso cars. It was a tough race, tough on the cars and the drivers but the strong finish gives us confidence about a good show in the European circuits, he said.         
	Asked if he expected Fisichella to come up with a show like this, Mallya said, We did not qualify well. If you remember, he finished 12th in yesterdays practice session as well. But then we made tactical errors in the qualifying session. Otherwise, a better grid position would have resulted in an ever better show.         
	Though Sutil managed his first finish of the season, the German is yet to live up to expectations.         
	Mallya, however, was not very worried about him. Im not worried with his performance. Racing is like this, you cant predict how the car would behave. I have seen enough strange incidents happening.         
	Today his car was damaged early that resulted in a broken nose. So Im not going to hold it against him, Mallya added.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sreevats, Das back in squad
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sreevats, Das back in squad
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Opener Arindam Das and wicketkeeper Sreevats Goswami were recalled to the Bengal squad for the Ranji Trophy quarter final against Tamil Nadu from Friday.         
	The CAB selection committee on Monday named the duo in place of Anustup Majumdar and Soham Ghosh. The squad will leave for Bangalore on Wednesday.         
	The CAB is still hoping Sourav Ganguly will play in the Ranji Trophy. Jagmohan Dalmiya, in fact, has requested Sourav to play for Bengal.         
	As a president, I have requested him to play for Bengal again. We have told him... But he will not be available for the upcoming match against Tamil Nadu. Lets see what happens if we qualify for the semi-finals. We have to respect his decision Dalmiya said.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB doesnt want to read too much into reports of Kolkata Knight Riders officials visiting the facilities in Cuttack.         
	They are looking for catchment areas in each zone. Perhaps in East they have chosen Bhubaneswar and so they went for a recce. In this way, they will distribute the matches among the venues so that there wont be much pressure on one stadium, Dalmiya said.         
	I met the Knight Riders officials on Monday. And they conveyed this idea of catchment areas in each zone, he said.

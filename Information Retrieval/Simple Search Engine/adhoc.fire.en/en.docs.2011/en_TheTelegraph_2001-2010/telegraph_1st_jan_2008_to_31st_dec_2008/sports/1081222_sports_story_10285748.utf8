The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim not keen on Shield
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Karim not keen on Shield
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Federation Cup winning coach is not willing to play in the IFA Shield, the most prestigious tournament of the city.         
	After lifting the Federation Cup on Sunday, Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa said he does not want to pay a heavy price for playing the IFA Shield by doing badly in the second phase of the I-League.         
	Weve already paid a heavy price for the pressure of the Calcutta Football League. We could have done better in the I-League otherwise. I dont want to repeat the same mistake, Bencharifa told reporters after the Federation Cup final at the Salt Lake Stadium. Its my personal opinion, he clarified. Well take a decision on the tournament later.         
	As of now, IFA Shield is scheduled to start on January 4 and Bencharifas words cast a doubt over the green-and-maroon brigades participation.         
	At the moment, my boys are going on a well-deserved holiday. They are very tired and Ill start thinking about future plans after the break, the coach said.         
	Im proud of my boys. I think we have the best team spirit in the country. You must have seen the way Manju celebrated this win. He didnt play this tournament. This shows the wonderful relation the players share. Weve been able to ward off all difficulties because of this, he said.         
	While he attributed the Federation Cup victory to the efforts of the team as a whole, Marcos Pereira and Deepak Mondal came in for special praise.         
	For me, Marcos is the man of the tournament. Hes taken a lot of workload and even today, he neutralised Beto, which upset Dempos plans, Karim said.         
	Deepak, for such a short man, is an extraordinary central defender. Most of the times he has to deal with guys much taller than him., he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reals poor run continues 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Reals poor run continues 
                      
	Madrid: Real Madrids poor run of form continued on Saturday when the Primera Liga champions lost 1-0 at struggling Real Valladolid and missed the chance to take over from Barcelona at the top of the table.         
	Valencia could have gone top had they beaten Sporting Gijon in the late match at the Mestalla but remain third after goals from Luis Moran, David Barral and Diego Castro gave the Asturians a 3-2 win.         
	Barcelona visit Recreativo Huelva in Sundays late match having won their last eight league games, scoring 33 goals. They have 25 points, one ahead of unbeaten Villarreal, who play at Malaga on Sunday.         
	Valencia have 23 points from 11 matches, the same as Real but one place ahead on goal difference, while Sporting are provisionally in seventh on 15 and Valladolid 10th with 13.         
	Real mounted a desperate charge for an equaliser and almost found one in the 75th minute but Valladolid keeper Sergio Asenjo saved two powerful drives from midfielder Wesley Sneijder.         
	Asenjo made a string of superb stops and kept Rauls weak effort out near the end after the striker intercepted a stray back pass and was through on goal.         
	Reals misery was compounded shortly before the end when their Argentina defender Gabriel Heinze was sent off after receiving two yellow cards in quick succession.         
	In the late match, striker Moran opened the scoring for Sporting midway through the first half when he ran on to Michels through ball and side-footed past keeper Renan.         
	Barral doubled the visitors lead shortly after the break, bamboozling Emiliano Moretti with a series of stepovers and squeezing a close-range shot inside the near post.         
	David Villa pulled a goal back from the penalty spot after Barrals handball, the Spain strikers 11th of the season and 100th Primera Liga goal, before Diego Castro made it 3-1 with about 10 minutes left when he volleyed in from a tight angle.         
	In Serie A, Inter Milan surged three points clear at the top after a sublime double from Zlatan Ibrahimovic sealed a 2-0 win at Palermo on Saturday.         
	The champions again failed to find their best form and relied on two moments of brilliance from the Swede, who first netted off the post with a swerving 20-metre shot just after halftime.         
	He then blasted in an unstoppable free kick after 62 minutes to stun the Sicilians, who had been livelier in attack than the defence-minded visitors in the first half.         
	Inter coach Jose Mourinho, who left out under-performing wingers Ricardo Quaresma and Mancini, is struggling to find the right balance in his side and started with four central defensive midfielders strung across the park.         
	Forward Fabrizio Miccoli had three half chances for mid-table Palermo but they were soon blown away by Ibrahimovics sixth and seventh league goals this term, with the former Ajax Amsterdam and Juventus striker unlucky not to claim a hattrick.

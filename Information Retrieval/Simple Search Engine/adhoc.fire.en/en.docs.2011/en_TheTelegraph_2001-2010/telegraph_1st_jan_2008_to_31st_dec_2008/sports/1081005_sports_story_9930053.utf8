            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: John Buchanan, the Kolkata Knight Riders coach, will be in the city on October 13. Hes expected to be around for a couple of days.         
	Theres some work to be done (in Calcutta) and Ill then head to Bangkok, where the IPL review meeting is now going to be held, the Brisbane-based Buchanan told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	The review was to have been in Goa, but a problem over accommodation has led to the change. Its likely to be held from October 16-18.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Toro Rosso up for sale 
                                                   Toro Rosso up for sale 
                      
	Berne: Red Bull will sell their Toro Rosso Formula One team before 2010 because of a change in the Formula One regulations, co-owner Dietrich Mateschitz has confirmed.         
	It is no big secret that we are putting the Toro Rosso team on the market, he told a Swiss website (www.motorsport-aktuell.com) after last weekends Australian Grand Prix.         
	The regulations are being changed for 2010. By then there can be no more synergies in either the design or the construction of our Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso teams, he added.         
	For that reason I see it as essential that we concentrate on one team. We will not be selling Toro Rosso during the 2008 season, but before 2010. (Reuters)

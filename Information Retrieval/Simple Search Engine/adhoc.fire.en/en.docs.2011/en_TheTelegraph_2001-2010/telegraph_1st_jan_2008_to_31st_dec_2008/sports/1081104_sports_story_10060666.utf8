The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting handled Lee poorly, says Taylor
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ponting handled Lee poorly, says Taylor
                      
	Melbourne: Former Australian skipper Mark Taylor has come hard on Ricky Ponting, saying he should not have embroiled in the on-field spat with pacer Brett Lee, and could have handled the situation in a better way.         
	During the second Test against India, Ponting and Lee were involved in a heated exchange, when the skipper did not bowl the speedstar in the morning session of the fourth day of the match.         
	Ponting, however, maintained that Lee was not introduced into the attack because of a slow over rate.         
	Ricky could have handled it better, away from the cameras and not in front of everyone, he said.         
	However, Taylor said he doesnt feel it would create a rift in the Australian squad.         
	Knowing Ricky and Brett I dont think that is going to cause a rift in the side. Its not easy when you play the game the way he has played it all his life.           (PTI)

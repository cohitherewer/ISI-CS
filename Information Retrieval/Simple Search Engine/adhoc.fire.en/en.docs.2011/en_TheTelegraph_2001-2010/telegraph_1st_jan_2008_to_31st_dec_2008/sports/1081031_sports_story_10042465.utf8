The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My priority is to regain the No. 1 spot, says Anand
                                                                                                                                                                                                       My priority is to regain the No. 1 spot, says Anand
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Viswanathan Anand                           
	Calcutta: Thursday was one of the busiest days for world champion Viswanathan Anand. Late in the evening, after a string of commitments which had to be honoured, the chess badshah briefly spoke to The Telegraph (for the second time, in fact) from Bonn.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Significance of the triple         
	Its another milestone for me... I defeated a big-match player (Vladimir Kramnik) and thats cause for much satisfaction... Whats also pleasing is that I could defend my title and, so, will be the world champion for more than just a year.  In the larger context, our juniors have been doing very well, but my win could still be a shot in the arm for chess back in India... Feels good, really.         
	Whether theres a next level         
	(Laughs) Im sure there is... I remain very excited about the sport and like to try out new things... Discover something new... I made some changes in my game this year and Im happy they clicked. As for the future, lets see.         
	If anything remains unfulfilled         
	Dont know... (Pauses) As Ive said, I remain very excited about chess... Im sure there will be things to achieve... A priority, of course, is to regain my world No.1 ranking (a position currently held by Bulgarias Veselin Topalov)...         
	On the tussle between him and shooter Abhinav Bindra for the label of the greatest Indian sportsman         
	Surely, you dont expect me to get into this! Im very happy for Abhinav, happy that years of hard work paid off in Beijing.         
	Bindras achievement         
	Oh, I was thrilled when Abhinav fired that gold in Beijing... I kept track of the days immediately afterwards too and followed his return home as well.         
	[Anand, by the way, will be in India within a fortnight.]         
	Staying so cool and whether the turmoil, if at all, is wholly within         
	(Laughs) Look, if Ive fooled people, then Im happy!         
	The ideal way to handle pressure and expectations         
	Its best to remain focused on the job and not get distracted... I managed to do that very well in Bonn. Once the focus is there, other things usually fall into place.         
	Finally, celebrations         
	We (wife Aruna is always by his side) did last night and intend going out tonight as well.

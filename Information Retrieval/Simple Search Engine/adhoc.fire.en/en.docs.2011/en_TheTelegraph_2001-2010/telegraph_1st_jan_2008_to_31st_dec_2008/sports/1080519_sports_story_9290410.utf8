	Hyderabad: Mumbai Indians notched up their sixth successive win to be in the hunt for a semi-final berth, beating Deccan Chargers by 25 runs in an Indian Premier League (IPL) encounter here on Sunday.         
	Mumbai first scored a competitive 178 for seven thanks to some sensible batting by Abishek Nayar and Dwayne Bravo and then restricted the hosts to 153 for seven in 20 overs.         
	Bravo, playing his last match in this edition, ended the tournament on a high as he scored 30 crucial runs and followed it up by three wickets.           (PTI)

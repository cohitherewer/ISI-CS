  - HONG KONG OPEN       A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Jeev Milkha Singh in action at the Hong Kong Open on Saturday. (AFP)                                       
	Calcutta: Jeev Milkha Singh fired a crucial four-under 66 in the third round on Saturday to climb to tied-fourth at the UBS Hong Kong Open.         
	Jeev, who was at tied 10th overnight, took his overall score to 10-under 200 with Saturdays effort. The Indian is currently three strokes behind the leader, Oliver Wilson of England.         
	Jeev (71, 63, 66), the winner of three titles this year, produced birdies on the third and sixth and a bogey on the ninth. He then picked up the pace by sinking three more birdies on the 11th, 13th and 15th to close with a solid 66.         
	Im comfortable with the way Im playing and Im confident and looking forward to tomorrow. This tournament has a lot of history and the set up is fantastic. Its great to be here, Jeev said.         
	Jyoti Randhawa (71, 68, 66) also shot a four-under 66 on the third day to take his total to five-under 205.         
	As a result, he climbed from his overnight position of tied 46th to tied 25th. Randhawas third round featured birdies on the third, fourth, ninth, 11th, 13th, 16th and bogeys on the sixth and 10th.         
	Gaurav Gheis (71, 69, 67) three-under 67 propelled him from tied 61st to tied 42nd. His total now reads three-under 207. Ghei came up with an eagle on the 13th, four birdies and three bogeys.         
	Wilson maintained his quest for a maiden European Tour win by edging ahead of the field while Bernhard Langer rolled back the years with a brilliant round.         
	Briton Wilson, looking for his first professional victory after a string of second-place finishes including the recent HSBC Champions in Shanghai, had a shaky start but finished at 13-under with a round of 65 as his putting gained in confidence.         
	You feel like youre sort of losing ground all the time around here, but youve just got to be patient, Wilson told reporters after adding six birdies to his opening hole bogey.         
	Lin Wen-tang of Taiwan birdied the last two holes to stand one off the pace at 12-under, while German veteran Langer was a further shot back after a superb round of 63.         
	Jeev, Spains Pablo Larrazabal, Briton Rory McIlroy and Francesco Molinari of Italy were grouped on 10-under, while Scotlands Colin Montgomerie was within striking distance at nine-under for the $2.5m co-sanctioned event.

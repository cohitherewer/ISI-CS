                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sachin, Sourav make more than just a statement
    - On-field rivals in the IPL take up cudgels for the senior brigade           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Sourav Ganguly           Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Mumbai: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has pitted Sachin Tendulkar against Sourav Ganguly but the issue of age, which keeps cropping up every now and then, has brought them together on the same side of the fence.         
	Indeed, at the pre-match media conference on Thursday, crickets senior-most pro Sachin and Sourav, who is among the most senior of players in India, made more than a statement on the business of age.         
	Sourav turns 36 in early July, Sachin turned 35 last month.         
	Its fashionable to talk of age, but Ive always maintained that class and performance matter If you look at the IPL, almost everybody who has got a hundred is over-30 Sanath Jayasuriya (a blazing unbeaten 114 for the Mumbai Indians on Wednesday) is almost 39 I myself missed a hundred narrowly, pointed out Sourav, who is captaining the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Just a few minutes earlier, Sachin (leading the Mumbai Indians) had said much the same thing. This tournament is the biggest proof that age doesnt matter Its performance This IPL should stop such questions         
	The other night, at the Eden, Sourav had even gone to the extent of saying I hope the selectors are watching At the media conference, though, he clarified hed been joking.         
	Asked whether his performances in the Twenty20 format would help him stage another comeback in ODIs, Sourav replied: Im sure my turn will (again) come in ODIs What I feel bad about is that after 13 years (starting with his Test debut at Lords in 1996), I still surprise people.         
	Contacted by The Telegraph, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar maintained: Weve certainly been impressed with the effort Sourav has been putting into his fielding Beyond that, I cant say anything The team gets picked by five selectors.         
	The selectors, meanwhile, have been given permission to watch the IPL matches from next week. I may come to Calcutta on the 25th (for the Knight Riders home match against Kings XI Punjab), Vengsarkar said.         
	Footnote: The Knight Riders owner, Shah Rukh Khan, has had a hair cut after ages. They cut it this (Thursday) morning for my new film  Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, he remarked during a TV shoot in the afternoon. Turning to Sourav, he asked: Theek hai na? Looks good? His captain gave a spontaneous thumbs-up.

	Dhaka: India snapped Pakistans 12-match winning streak by inflicting a crushing 140-run defeat in the second match of the one-day tri-series at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium on Tuesday.         
	An allround performance ensured an Indian victory as their batsmen and bowlers fired in unison to stop Pakistans march. It was also Indias biggest win in terms of runs versus Pakistan.         
	Indians, having elected to bat, piled up a massive 330 for eight, thanks to a stupendous batting by the top-order.         
	Openers Virender Sehwag (89) and Gautam Gambhir (62) hit sparkling half-centuries and shared an amazing 155-run partnership to lay a strong foundation for the big total.         
	Pakistan, in reply, were bundled out for 190 in just 35.4 overs, giving India their biggest win against them.         
	Skipper Shoaib Malik waged a lone battle with his 53-run knock and did not find any able ally at the other end.         
	Praveen Kumar (4/53) spoiled Pakistans run-chase as he rocked their batting line-up by claiming three quick wickets, including two off consecutive balls. Young spinner Piyush Chawla also returned with figures of four for 40.         
	Pakistan were tottering at 26 for three inside the first five overs after Praveen scalped Salman Butt (9), Younis Khan (0) and Mohammed Yousuf (11), sending shock waves through their top-order.         
	However, Praveen was creamed for 17 runs in the ninth over of the innings when Kamran Akmal, who looked in sublime touch, and Misbah-ul Haq reeled off four boundaries to take the score to 58 for three.         
	Akmal (38) then hit Praveen for a big six but the Uttar Pradesh bowler had the last laugh when he sent him back. The wicketkeeper-batsman mistimed a low full toss and ended up being caught at mid-on by Yusuf Pathan, who made his ODI debut.         
	Misbah (24) too joined Akmal in the dressing room when teen sensation Ishant Sharma beat him with a pacy and rising delivery and induced an edge, taken comfortably by Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	The big burden of climbing the run-mountain then fell on the shoulders of skipper Malik and out of form Shahid Afridi as the asking rate soared up to seven an over.         
	A much-needed partnership once again eluded the Pakistan side as Afridi (23) succumbed to over-aggression, failing to build on a good start.         
	It was a matter of formality from here as Pakistans hopes ended with Afridis wicket.         
	Earlier, Indias top order fired in unison to help them amass 330 for eight. After Sehwag and Gambhir stitched a 155-run opening stand in just over 21 overs, India seemed set for a 350-plus score but they subsequently lost part of the momentum.         
	Umar Gul was the pick of the Pakistan attack, claiming three for 61 in his 10 overs.         
	Wahab Riaz, who was disallowed to complete his quota of 10 overs because he fired two beamers at the Indian batsmen, and Shahid Afridi, claimed two wickets each.         
	Pakistan cut a sorry figure as a fielding unit with Younis Khan twice dropping Gambhir when the batsman was on four and 29, respectively.

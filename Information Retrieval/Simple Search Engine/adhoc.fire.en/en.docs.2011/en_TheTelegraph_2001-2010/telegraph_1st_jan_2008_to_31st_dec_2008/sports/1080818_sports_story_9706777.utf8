The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Akhil: I will get a medal
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Akhil: I will get a medal
            MADHUMITA GANGULY                      
	Beijing: A win away from creating history, boxer Akhil Kumar still remains his cocky, irreverent self.         
	Defeating world champion Sergey Vodopyanov in the pre-quarter finals of the 54kg bantamweight and standing on the threshold of a medal, Akhil, however, didnt appear complacent. He did sound confident, though, on the eve of his bout against 25-year-old Veaceslav Gojan of Moldova.         
	Is he under pressure from the expectations of a billion Indians? Well Yes, the expectations do create a certain amount of pressure, Akhil told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	However, I will get a medal, no matter what, he emphasised. Ive got the chance to capture an Olympic medal and I do not want to lose this opportunity.         
	Even before he boarded the flight to Beijing, Akhil has been insisting that he will not settle for anything less than gold.         
	The Haryana boxer, who won the 2006 Commonwealth Games, however said that one must never underestimate an opponent.         
	A number of players have lost because they have taken their opponents for granted. Vodopyanov had made the same mistake and look who reached the quarter finals.         
	The 27-year-old has not faced Gojan before but said that he had watched recordings. He has consulted his coaches and formulated a strategy and vowed that he will be not be caught off guard in his preparation for this bout.         
	Overwhelmed by the wishes he has been receiving on Sunday  Itna phone calls mujhe kabhi bhi nahin mila, he said with a childlike glee. He utilised this opportunity to request for assistance, by way of jobs and financial security for boxers.         
	In the 51kg flyweight quarter finals, Akhils cousin Jitender Kumar meets three-time European champion Russian Georgy Balakshin.         
	I am in the form of my life, said Jitender, who along with Vijender Kumar in the 75kg middle weight category will fight for glory on Wednesday. Theres no stopping me this time.         
	He has drawn inspiration and motivation from his mentor Akhil and has already decided to dedicate this victory to him.         
	Jitender had lost to the Russian in the 2007 World Championship by just one point but this time the youngest member of the squad is better prepared.         
	Akhil has beaten him in the past and Ill ask him how to go about it, he added.         
	Vijender will take on Carlos Gongora of Ecuador. Both Akhil and Vijemder have beaten Olympic medallists this year. Vijender defeated the man voted the Best Boxer from the 2004 Athens Games, Bakhtiyar Artayev of Kazakhstan, in a competition in Taiwan in May.         
	Akhil defeated Thailands Athens silver medallist Worapoj Petchkoom to win a qualifying tournament in February.         
	Incidentally, all the three are members of the Bhiwani Boxing Club, which is referred to as the Cuba of India.            
	AKHIL KUMAR  
	 (DoB: MARCH 21, 1981)  
	 Akhil Kumar rsquo;s run-up to 2008 Beijing Olympic Games began with a gold in 2005 Commonwealth Championships and yet another gold in 2006 Commonwealth Games, but the good run was cut short by a career-threatening wrist injury which kept him out of action in 2007.He stunned the world with his skill by beating world champion Sergey Vodopyanov of Russia in the pre quarters in Beijing, Akhil now stands on the threshold of history.             
	VIJENDER KUMAR   
	 (DoB: OCTOBER 29, 1985)  
	 The 75kg middleweight pugilist from Haryana may well create history, becoming the third Indian to reach the quarter finals of the Beijing Olympic Games after taming Angkhan Chomphuphuang of Thailand. Leave alone the prospect of a medal, losing the first two qualifiers including the World Championship in Chicago had almost derailed his campaign. But like a true champion, Vijender fought back. Can he follow in Abhinav Bindra rsquo;s footsteps?            
	JITENDER KUMAR  
	 (DoB: JULY 18, 1988)  
	 A product of the Bhiwani Boxing Club of Haryana and the youngest member of the boxing squad, Jitender, who competes in the 51kg flyweight category could not wait to take part in the Olympics. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games, Jitender won a bronze and was first noticed. This year he won a silver medal at Kings Cup in Thailand and a gold medal at Chemistry Cup in Halle. He credits his success to Akhil Kumar, his cousin and mentor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev rallies to best finish in majors
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeev rallies to best finish in majors
                  Jeev Milkha Singh                     
	Augusta: A resolute Jeev Milkha Singh fought back from a disastrous start for his best finish at a major. He finished tied 25th in the US Masters but his failure to sign off among the top 16 means he will not get a return ticket to the prestigious event.         
	The Indian shot a final-round three-over 75 on a chilly, windswept day to end his campaign at four-over 292, 12 strokes off the pace of winner Trevor Immelman (75), who became the second South African after Gary Player to claim the green jacket.         
	Jeev was six over after the first 10 holes before hitting four birdies over a five-hole stretch to salvage his round on a day when only four players broke par.         
	The former Asian Tour No. 1 however bettered his previous best finish at a major, which was a tied 36th in the US Open last year.         
	He was, however, disappointed and said he could have finished higher up on the leader board but messed up his chances by trying too hard.         
	I am really disappointed. I came back pretty strongly on the back nine I tried but I made too many mistakes on the front nine. My management wasnt up to the mark. I was pushing myself too much and getting result-orientated and I paid the price, said Jeev, who finished tied 37th in his Masters debut last year.         
	I was trying shots which I shouldnt have. On the first and ninth holes I should have just made sure I got the ball up on the green and I didnt.         
	Jeev said he would learn from the experience to do better if he gets a chance next year. Im a little disappointed with the way I finished as I wanted the top 16. Hopefully I can learn from this and come back next year.         
	Jeev stumbled to double bogeys on the first and ninth holes after miscalculating his shots and dropped a couple of more shots on the third and fifth holes. He had a birdie on the second.         
	When the Indian bogeyed the 10th after another errant approach from the middle of the fairway, he was in danger of finishing with a disastrous card. However, a birdie on the par-five 13th sparked a fightback.         
	Jeev then enjoyed a Masters moment on the 14th hole when he spun his wedge shot to within inches for a tap-in birdie while playing partner Nick Watney sensationally holed out for an eagle.         
	Jeev converted a 15-foot birdie on the 16th hole and trickled in his fifth birdie from 12 feet on the 17th, only to bogey the 18th after a blocked drive clipped a tree, missing a six foot par save.         
	After 10, I said I had nothing to lose. That was the attitude and I came back strongly. The last hole left a sour taste in the mouth. But the 14th was fantastic, it was a great feeling. That hole has always got me and I got it today, said Jeev.         
	The Indian, who has had two runner-up finishes on the Asian Tour this season, will take next week off before heading to Shanghai for the BMW Asian Open.         
	He will also play an event in Japan before returning to Europe with the aim of working his way back into the worlds top 50.         
	You learn a lot every time you play here. Im mentally tired. Every hole takes a lot out of you. Ill take the week off, refresh myself and start all over again, said Jeev, who is presently ranked 83rd in the world.

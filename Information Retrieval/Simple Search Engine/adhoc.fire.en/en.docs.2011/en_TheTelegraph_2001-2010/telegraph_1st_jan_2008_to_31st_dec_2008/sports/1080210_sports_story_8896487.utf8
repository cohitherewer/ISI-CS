	Calcutta: A 15-year-old batsman  Sankalan Das  smashed an unbeaten 351 in a single day in a CAB junior (110 points) cricket tournament match on Tuesday.         
	Left-hander Das, turning out for Mainland Sambaran Cricket Academy (MSCA), tore the opponent bowlers apart en route to his triple hundred against 38-ward Krira--Unnayan Parishad on the opening day of the league game at Vivekananda Park.         
	Sankalan, batting at No. 3, blazed to 351 off 211 balls with 56 boundaries and a dozen sixes, enabling his team reach a massive 687 for seven, according to former national selector Sambaran Banerjee.         
	However, the CAB could not confirm whether this was a record in local cricket.

                                                  Gambhir: Ive never felt this confident
                  Gautam Gambhir                     
	Brisbane: Gautam Gambhir has devised a simple formula to be successful in Australia in the ongoing tri-series  see the ball, hit the ball and play in the V.         
	Gambhir, the lone centurion in the series so far with a 99-ball unbeaten 102 against Sri Lanka in Brisbane on Tuesday, said conditions Down Under were conducive for stroke making and he preferred to meet the ball on the frontfoot.         
	The plan is simple, see the ball, hit the ball and play in the V. The conditions here give a batsman full value for his strokes though (admittedly) you need a lot of courage and determination, said Gambhir. There is a lot of talk that when you come to Australia you play on the backfoot all the time. But if you ask me, the plan should be to meet the ball on the frontfoot.         
	He admitted that going on the frontfoot against genuine fast bowlers like Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson may not be easy. Its difficult to get on to the frontfoot when you are facing genuine quick bowlers like Lee or Johnson but there is very little chance when you are playing on the backfoot.         
	Unlike most of his teammates, including skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Gambhir has played in Australia and faced some of the quicks who are part of their national squad now.         
	I had played in Australia for India A before and have faced the likes of Johnson and Shaun Tait. I did well then and to be honest, I have never felt this confident before, Gambhir said.         
	He has a simple mantra in life: You dont win a silver, you lose a gold. The inference is clear: win at all costs.         
	That is what I believe in and this is what I want to maintain throughout my playing career. (PTI)

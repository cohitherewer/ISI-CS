	Pune: Top seed Saina Nehwal stormed into the final of the girls singles event of the World Junior badminton championship, even as compatriot RMV Gurusaidutt crashed out in the semi-finals of the boys category here on Saturday.         
	Saina had no problems in quelling the challenge of third seed Shixian Wang and took just 37 minutes to send the Chinese packing 22-20, 21-12. The Beijing Olympics quarterfinalist will face ninth seed Sayaka Sato in the summit clash on Sunday.

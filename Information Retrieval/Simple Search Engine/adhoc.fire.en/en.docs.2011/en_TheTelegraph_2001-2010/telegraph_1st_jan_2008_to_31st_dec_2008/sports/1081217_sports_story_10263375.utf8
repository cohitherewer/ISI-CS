	Calcutta: The Federation of International Cricketers Associations (Fica) will work closely with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to ensure that the most applicable security arrangements are provided to the players, in the wake of growing concerns across the world.         
	Fica will be constructing a detailed security survey and requesting players from across the world to complete this survey in order for ICC to be acutely aware of the players concerns and observations of such security issues, said the federations chief executive Tim May.

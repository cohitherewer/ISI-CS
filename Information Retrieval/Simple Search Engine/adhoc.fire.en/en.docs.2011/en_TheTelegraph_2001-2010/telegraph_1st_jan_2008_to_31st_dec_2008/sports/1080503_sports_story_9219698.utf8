  - Riders desperate to leave behind controversies and losses ahead of encounter vs Kings XI       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Umar Gul and Ishant Sharma in Mohali on Friday                                 
	Mohali: Kolkata Knight Riders coach John Buchanan on Friday played down the spat between captain Sourav Ganguly and Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne. It has already been dealt with by the IPL and we are concentrating on cricket, Buchanan, who addressed the media instead of Ganguly on the eve of the match against hosts Kings XI Punjab, told reporters in a news conference on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Sourav-Warne spat         
	Its not a team issue. We are here to play good cricket. The matter has been dealt with by the IPL authorities and both Warne and Ganguly have accepted what the IPL has said.         
	Growing number of controversies in the tournament         
	Controversies will be there and the media will always be on the look out for them. It is your job, not ours.         
	Umar Guls views on Souravs captaincy         
	It has been misinterpreted. What he meant was how best we have to work out to play the Twenty20 game. Sourav is a good captain the team stands solidly behind him.         
	[Gul had said in a press conference on Thursday that it was not easy to adjust to the Twenty20 format. Even the captain is having problem in leading in this format of the game. He is also learning it, he said.         
	On three loses in a row         
	It is a challenge for us (to do well). We started with two wins. There have been certain improvements in the team and we hope it will show in Saturdays game or the next one. But we are very keen to click as a group which we have not been doing for the last three games. In the first match, Brendon McCullum set very high standards for everyone else in the tournament.         
	The game plan for Saturday         
	We are working on the implementation of skills and expect a good performance on Saturday. We will see elements of the teams progress.         
	The Shoaib Akhtar issue         
	It is BCCIs decision (not to allow him to play).         
	Lessons from the three losses         
	We lost three wicket inside the power play in the last few games and are working on ensuring that it does not happen in the future.

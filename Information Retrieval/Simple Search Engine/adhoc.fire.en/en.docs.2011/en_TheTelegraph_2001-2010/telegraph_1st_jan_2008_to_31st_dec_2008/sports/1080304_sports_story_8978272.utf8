                                                    Border praise for Harbhajan

 - Beleaguered off-spinner finds support from all quarters

	Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh, under attack from the Australian media which has been pulling out all stops to vilify him, has found unlikely support from a former Australian captain. 
    
	The iconic Allan Border on Monday came out in support of the beleaguered off-spinner, saying that Harbhajan was actually being abused by the SCG crowd and that his behaviour under the situation was praiseworthy. 
    
	I was over that side of the ground and Harbhajan was copping a fair bit of stick from the crowd, Border was quoted as saying by the Herald Sun. 
    
	I didnt notice any gestures at all and I thought he (Harbhajan) handled himself pretty well. Im not so sure how serious it is. 
    
	The iconic former captain said it was a shame that a great century by the peerless Sachin Tendulkar was overshadowed by off-field incidents. 
    
	Its a shame that a great century by Sachin in his farewell tour of Australia was being overshadowed by a few bits of silliness in the outfield, he was quoted as saying on Monday. 
    
	Its (the incident) not a big deal. 
    
	Australian middle-order batsman Mike Hussey too said he hadnt seen or heard anything, the report stated. 
    
	I havent heard a single thing about it, Hussey said. 
    
	He said too much was being made of things away from the game. 
    
	I think the Australian and Indian public have had enough of all the controversy, Hussey said. 
    
	We just want to concentrate on the cricket. 
    
	Meanwhile, a section of the media also reported that the off-spinner was himself the victim of racial and religious taunts. 
    
	The Daily Telegraph reported that some fans taunted Harbhajan by saying show us your knot and get a haircut, in reference to his being a Sikh. 
    
	The paper cited the example of two fans at the SCG who wore t-shirts inscribed with racial comments. 
    
	Andrew Wilson and Darren Jones were among a group of 20 fans from Newcastle wearing t-shirts carrying the words  Monkey see Monkey do  in reference to Harbhajans alleged abuse of Andrew Symonds in Sydney, the report said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal look to seal semis berth
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bengal look to seal semis berth
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Srinagar: Standing near the swimming pool of a local school here, Bengal coach Krishnendu Roy looked lost in his thoughts. His wards were busy enjoying a swim, splashing water at each other but Roy, it seemed, wasnt touched by their enthusiasm.         
	Suddenly, the coach lifted his head and broke into a broad smile. I have a problem in hand, he said. The success against Karnataka on Sunday has increased my difficulties, he said with a grin.         
	Against Maharashtra on Tuesday, the Bengal team management has a plan to rest some of the regular players. While a couple of boys have already earned a yellow card each, others should get enough rest before the semi-finals, Roy said.         
	But the big win against Karnataka has given the players so much confidence that no one is willing to warm the bench. They are all absolutely pepped up and want to play in the same pace against Maharashtra. If we can manage to keep up this spirit, good results are bound to come, the coach said.         
	Nevertheless, at least three players  Mehtab Hussain, Seikh Azim and Habibur Rehman  are bound to make way for Lalkamal Bhowmick, Arnab Mondal and Bijoy Basfore on Tuesday.         
	Given the confidence level in the Maharashtra camp, Bengal should easily gain three points even without their main players. Maharashtra are a listless side, crippled by the non-co-operative attitude of the top Mumbai teams.         
	Neither Mumbai FC nor Mahindra United have released their players to do duty for the state team, forcing coach Bimal Ghosh to come here with a bunch of inexperienced players from Air India, ONGC, Central Railways and different districts.         
	So much so, that the Maharashtra State Association has issued show cause notices to Mumbai FC and Mahindra players, threatening them with disciplinary actions for not joining the state camp. To avoid action, the players are likely to submit medical certificates en masse.         
	All that Bengal need now is a point against Maharashtra to seal their place in the semi-finals.

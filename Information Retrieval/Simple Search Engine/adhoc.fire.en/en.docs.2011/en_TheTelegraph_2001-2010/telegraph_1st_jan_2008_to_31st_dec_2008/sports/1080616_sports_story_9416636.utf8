            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Srinagar: It was a dream come true for Punjab coach Jagir Singh on Sunday. For the second time in the history of the National Championships, Punjab won the Santosh Trophy for the second consecutive year and Jagir is confident his team will complete a hattrick.         
	In the mid-Eighties, we won back to back titles in Kanpur and Jabalpur, Jagir said. At the moment, we have a team that is capable of bagging the title again next season.         
	Jagir was right, Punjab have definitely shown the way. While star-studded teams like Bengal and Goa lost ground early, Punjab achieved their target with a bunch of youngsters.         
	Our team have several players from our JCT Academy, said Punjab manager and former India captain Parminder Singh. We carefully select young players from all over the state and then give them good coaching. The success hasnt come overnight.         
	Players like Gurwinder Singh, Sakatar Singh, Balwant Singh, Baljit Sahni and Balraj Singh are all products of the academy. The result proved that the Punjab Football Association (PFA) is doing a good job and the JCT Academy is working in the right direction, said former national coach Sukhwinder Singh.

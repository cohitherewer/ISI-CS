	London: Tanmay Srivastava has been reprimanded by the ICC after being found guilty of breaching its Code of Conduct during the Under-19 World Cup.         
	The incident occurred in the semi-final against New Zealand in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday when Srivastava was reported by the umpires for pointing batsman Corey Anderson towards the pavilion in an aggressive manner after clean bowling him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anils strength was more mental than physical
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anils strength was more mental than physical
                    GUEST COLUMN     Bishan Singh Bedi                                    
	Sometimes unwarranted injuries at vital moments come as a blessing in disguise. This was what happened to Anil Kumble on Saturday at the Kotla. It was a sharp chance that came his way, but only to be spilled. A total of 11 stitches were needed on his non-bowling hand. The agony must have been unbearable. But the incident turned out to have helped Anil in his decision to hang up his boots without further delay.         
	For some time now, this decision seemed to be coming. Of late, Anil has been having a forgetful form with the ball. His right shoulder has not been co-operating for long, much to the dismay of the never-say-die leggie, whose career spanned 18 glorious years.         
	Indias highest wicket-taker in Tests and ODIs was determined to stretch his career. Alas, though the mind was willing, the body wasnt! Hence the abrupt end to a superlative career came about at his favourite Kotla. Would it be out of place to rename Ferozeshah as Kumbles Kotla!         
	The cricketing globe has often seen Kumbles fighting qualities. He was nicknamed the smiling assassin not without reason. Out of his 619 Test wickets, more than a hundred have come against Australia alone. It puts him in the same bracket as the great Shane Warne.         
	As one who helped India win maximum Test matches (43), Kumble stands alone atop the Everest of Indian cricket. With 337 ODI victims, Kumble inspires awe.         
	From a bespectacled scholarly youngster, Kumbles has come a long way to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with other modern greats like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman.         
	Kumbles initiation into cricket had been anything but promising. A tall, unathletic Kumble used to chuck medium pace until a local umpire in Bangalore called him and forced him to bowl innocuous leg-breaks of the freakish kind.         
	Once he found his moorings on his first trip to England in 1990, Kumbles stature grew, slowly but surely. The mechanical engineer brought all his intellectual forces to the fore and worked doggedly on his fitness. In the process, he surprised many of his detractors who doubted his ability to bowl spin.         
	I have always believed one need not be a big spinner of the ball to beat the bat consistently. You just need to deviate the ball enough to beat the bat and hit the timber or the pads.         
	Most of Kumbles dismissals were leg before or clean-bowled. He also has the distinction of getting most wickets through caught and bowled. This is the hallmark of any bowler who never takes his eyes off the ball after releasing it.         
	Kumbles strength was not so much physical as it was mental. His stamina to bowl long spells was unmatched. He was seldom taken to the cleaners. What Anil lacked in speed or movement, he made it up with high level of concentration and application. Kumbles suppleness matched his sportsman spirit and he was the perfect gentleman under trying circumstances. No wonder the entire cricketing world respects him as the gentleman cricketer par excellence.         
	It is a pity that the job of leading India fell into his lap a shade too late. He had all the qualities of a leader and would have done the toughest job in Indian cricket with aplomb. Only 14 Tests in 18 years didnt quite do justice to Kumbles leadership qualities. His colleagues from Karnataka  Dravid and Jawagal Srinath  rave about his extraordinary qualities as a cricketer and a human being. Laxman, Sourav Ganguly and Tendulkar too talk about Kumbles vast influence in the Indian dressing room.         
	An exceptionally private family man, Kumble derives all the spiritual strength from his mother and his wife. Kumbles business acumen is another of his features. I foresee Kumble as a players representative on the BCCI. I am sure he will help solve many a ticklish problem. Perhaps he can try his hand at commentary  his rich voice unbiased and without any hidden agenda.         
	May you live long Kumbles, and help guide the destiny of Indian cricket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians eye final berth
                                                                                                                                                                                             Indians eye final berth
  - AFC CHALLENGE CUP 
  -   Hosts are favourites, says Myanmar coach   Bhaichung Bhutia       JAYDEEP BASU            Sunil Chhetri                                 
	Hyderabad: Bob Houghton does not need a microphone when he addresses a gathering. Even people sitting in the last row would have no problem hearing his voice, and more often than not, the British coach makes an impact with his choice of words, witty remarks and reasoning.         
	But never before in the last two years has the national coach displayed such high level of confidence as he did on Wednesday. On the eve of Indias AFC Challenge Cup semi-final against Myanmar, Houghton was almost whispering, but he made it clear that his wards, by all means, are gearing up to play the final next Sunday.         
	So much so, that when someone suggested that skipper Bhaichung Bhutia could be marked against Myanmar, the Indian coach replied it with a smile. Bhaichung has been marked regularly for the past 15 years. I am sure he knows how to play in such a situation.         
	The Indian team, so far, has played 14 matches this season and lost only one against Maldives in the Saff Cup final in Colombo.         
	This time, we are careful that we should not lose an important match, the national coach said. Myanmar are a good skilful team and it will be a tough match. But I am sure that my boys are capable of taking up the challenge this time.         
	The weather and the schedule, however, could be a cause for worry, Houghton said. It is never easy to win five matches in a row, that too, in such a short time. Secondly, the ground could be very hard to play if it dries up after the rain.         
	The victory against Turkmenistan in the last league match has done wonders. The Indian players are high on confidence despite some of the main players nursing injuries.         
	While midfielder N.P. Pradeep may sit out for Wednesdays match because of hamstring injury, Steven Dias and Climax Lawrence have sore ankles. Striker Sunil Chhetri has a few stitches on his eye and experienced Deepak Mondal and Mahesh Gawli are yet to recover from their injuries. But unlike the Saff Cup, the Indian players seem hardly bothered by the long list of injuries. Deepak and Mahesh bhai didnt play the last match. We have to do without them and win, said goalkeeper Subrata Pal.         
	Another youngster, Gourmangi Singh, echoed similar views. Whatever comes, we have to play the final. Winning the title and qualifying for the 2011 Asian Cup final round is our only goal.         
	Myanmar, ranked 157th in the Fifa rankings, had beaten India innumerable times in the 60s and 70s. But on Wednesday, as Myanmars Brazilian coach Marcos Falopa also admitted, India will start the favourites.         
	Firstly, India are playing at home, Marcos said. I also must say India have been the best team in the tournament so far.

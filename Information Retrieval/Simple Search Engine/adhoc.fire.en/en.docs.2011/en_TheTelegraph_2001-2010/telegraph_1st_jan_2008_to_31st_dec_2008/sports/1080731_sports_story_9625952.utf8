The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I have complete faith in my team: Kumble
                                                                                                                                                                                                     I have complete faith in my team: Kumble
    - Captain refuses to blame any individual for 1st test loss           OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Galle: India captain Anil Kumble expressed faith in his batsmen on the eve of the second Test against Sri Lanka to be played here from Thursday and said everybody needs to play to his potential to win the second Test.         
	The following are the excerpts:               
	Do you feel the batting order needs to be rearranged?         
	No, not really, I have complete faith in my team and the batting line-up that we have. I dont think Ill do anything with that.         
	Zaheer left the nets early today. Is he okay?         
	Hes fine. Before a match this is our routine. Whenever they feel theyve had a good session theyre off.         
	The pitch here is likely to be a turner. What are your plans about playing on it?         
	Well definitely approach this in a positive way. Wed like to go out and try and get a good score. Then we have the quality of spinners as well to come into the game.         
	What do you think should be done to stage a comeback?         
	One down is one down whether youre in Australia or Sri Lanka. Its a matter of regrouping and we have spent quality time discussing issues, how to cope and how to come back. Weve done that in the past, the same set of players. There is definitely a lot of resilience and experience in this team.         
	Have you given any particular instruction to the batsmen?         
	The batsmen are experienced enough to work out what is the best option for them out in the middle and handle whatever comes their way. We will be positive because we need to win this Test match.         
	How important is the toss going to be?         
	Toss and weather are not things we like to concentrate on. Whether we bowl first or bat first we still have to do the job. We need to bowl in the right areas, hold our catches and when our chance comes to bat we have to score runs. In the sub-continent, the toss does play a crucial part but its not something we like to worry about.         
	Was it just the batting that let the team down in the first Test?         
	Its not just the batting line-up. All members of the team are disappointed about what happened in the last game but we need to put that disappointment behind us and are looking forward to this challenge. We always knew it was not going to be easy coming to Sri Lanka and doing well.         
	Dinesh Karthik did not do well in the last match. Are you thinking about replacing him?         
	Its not just one particular player who didnt have a good outing. If you look at the team, overall I dont think we played to our potential. Its very wrong to point fingers at one player in the team. Whatever confidence that I can give as captain Ive done. Its not just about Dinesh (Karthik). Hes a quality player. Im sure hell show his class here.

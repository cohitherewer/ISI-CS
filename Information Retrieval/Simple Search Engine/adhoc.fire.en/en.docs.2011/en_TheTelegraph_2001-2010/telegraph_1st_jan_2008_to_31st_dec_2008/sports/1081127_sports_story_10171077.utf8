The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Change attitude: Waugh
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Change attitude: Waugh
                      
	Melbourne: Former Australia skipper Steve Waugh has a word of advice for allrounder Andrew Symonds, who was involved in a bar brawl, to change his demeanour towards the public in order to avert such controversies which has been chasing the cricketer in recent times.         
	My philosophy is dont look down on people who look up to you. Sometimes you are larger than life to people, they might have only seen you on TV or whatever, you have to be polite.         
	Most of the time the easier option is to give the person your autograph or have a picture taken. It takes longer to say no than just to oblige with a fans request  as long as the person is respectful, Waugh was quoted as saying by a newspaper on Wednesday.

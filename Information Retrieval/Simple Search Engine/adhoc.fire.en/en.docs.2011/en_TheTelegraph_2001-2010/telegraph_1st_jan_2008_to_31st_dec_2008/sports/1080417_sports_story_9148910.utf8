                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chris Gayle boost to Riders squad
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Five foreign players have been included in the Kolkata Knight Riders 14-man squad for their first two matches in the Indian Premier League. Knight Riders play the lung opener against Bangalore Royal Challengers in Bangalore on Friday and take on Deccan Chargers (Hyderabad) in a home tie two days later.         
	Chris Gayle, Ricky Ponting, Brendon McCullum, David Hussey and Mohammed Hafeez figure in the list. West Indian Gayle is expected to arrive in time for the opener. Zimbabwean Tatenda Taibu doesnt find a berth.         
	The real surprise in the squad has been the inclusion of Ashok Dinda. The Bengal mediumpacer, who was in the reserves, found a place after he managed to impress John Buchanan during the practice tie on Tuesday. Ranadeb Bose has been a significant exclusion.         
	Buchanan, who held several rounds of discussion with captain Sourav Ganguly during the day, said he was satisfied with the squad. The players enjoyed an off day before their departure on Thursday.         
	Weve a pretty decent batting at the top of the order. Theres lot of experience too, the coach said after the team meeting at the hotel in the morning.         
	Buchanan brushed aside any talk of a weak bowling in the absence of Shoaib Akhtar and Umar Gul.         
	 The bowling is not weak We have a lot of variety A decent pace attack with the presence of Ishant Sharma and Ajit Agarkar Dinda looked very impressive during the practice match yesterday.         
	The spin department is led by Murali Kartik We also have good allrounders in (Laxmi Ratan) Shukla along with Mohammed Hafeez and David Hussey.         
	The former Australia coach was pinning great hopes on Sourav. Sourav is scoring runs. Hes looking forward to leading the side and were expecting big things from him. He has a clear idea about what to expect from whom said Buchanan.         
	He said he was concentrating on the teams gameplan rather than taking a closer look at the opponents. We just cant keep thinking about our opponents, the Bangalore Royal Challengers We have to concentrate on our strategy and plan.         
	Ishant has also impressed Buchanan. Ive seen Ishant in Australia He also looked decent in the last Test versus South Africa. He has it in him to go the distance if he can stay fit.         
	Dinda said he was a bit surprised at his inclusion. I knew Shoaib and Gul were unavailable. I was confident of doing well at nets Gave in my hundred per cent. Having bowled to Sourav during practice I knew how to go about it. I will hope to fulfil expectations, said the youngster.         
	THE SQUAD

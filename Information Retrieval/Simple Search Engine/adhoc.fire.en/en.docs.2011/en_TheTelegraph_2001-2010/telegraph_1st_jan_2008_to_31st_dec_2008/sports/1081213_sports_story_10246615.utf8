The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Formula One unveils cost-cutting plans
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Formula One unveils cost-cutting plans
                      
	Monaco: Formula One teams will cut their costs by almost a third next year under a package of measures approved on Friday to secure the sports future in the face of the global credit crunch.         
	The governing International Automobile Federation (FIA) said in a statement that independent teams would see engine costs halved in 2009, with a years supply priced at under five million euros ($6.63million) from 2010 compared to at least 15 million at present.         
	Testing will be banned during the season other than at regular Friday practice at Grand Prix weekends.         
	From 2010, refuelling will cease and Grand Prix distances could be shortened.         
	The FIA estimated the new measures would save manufacturer-owned teams the equivalent of 30 per cent of their 2008 budgets next year, with independent teams seeing even more reductions.         
	The measures come with the sport staring into the abyss, with the manufacturers who own half of the teams facing plunging sales and share prices.         
	I think this is probably the first step towards Formula One saving itself, FIA president Max Mosley told reporters.           (REUTERS)

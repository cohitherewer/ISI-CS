The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I believe in my team, says Paes
                                                                                                                                                                                                     I believe in my team, says Paes
  - Captain admits to clash of egos but says that will only help the side              OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: With only 48 hours to go before India take on Japan in the crucial Asia-Oceania Zone group I Davis Cup tie, Leander Paes and his men are fighting hard to put up a united front.         
	In the morning, during the long and strenuous practice session at the National Sports Club of India (NSCI)         
	here, one could easily spot the players who didnt look comfortable in the company of certain others.         
	Later, however, captain Paes was at pains to explain that the players had put aside the internal squabbles which had hit Indian tennis hard in the recent past. This team is capable of playing in the World Group and I am sure the boys will achieve the target, he said.         
	Paes said he believed a team with a little ego will perform better in an international match. He admitted that there was a clash of egos but said that would only help the team.         
	As an athlete, you always have an ego but that also means that these guys will play their hearts out when they go on court. If there is unhappiness, as a captain I have to handle it. Its tough being a captain, but the most important thing is I believe in my team, he said.         
	Indian tennis was rocked by a players revolt against Paes during the previous Davis Cup tie against Uzbekistan in February, forcing the All India Tennis Association (AITA) officials to step in and force a temporary truce.         
	While Mahesh Bhupathi, who led the revolt, said all was well within the team, Paes admitted that the team was still sorting out some issues.         
	Our strength is that we handle things as a team. In life you go through ups and downs but the important thing is how you handle them. We are all looking forward to winning the tie and I am sure the boys will put their best foot forward, he said.         
	Paes said though India were favourites on grass, the Japanese had also evolved into a fine team. I think the Japanese have a lot more depth this time. Their players are in good form but we are also well prepared, he said.         
	In the morning, Paes and Bhupathi practised together for the doubles for nearly 90 minutes. Rohan Bopanna was the only player to skip the practice session.         
	I got an MRI done on my knee last evening and skipped practice to get it treated so that I can be fully fit for the tie day after, Bopanna said.

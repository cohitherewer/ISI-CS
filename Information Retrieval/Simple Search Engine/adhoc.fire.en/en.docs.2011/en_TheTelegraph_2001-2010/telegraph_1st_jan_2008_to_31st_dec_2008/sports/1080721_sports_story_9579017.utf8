	ANECDOTES         
	Drama         
	The Rome Games witnessed many dramas: a Danish cyclist, Knud Eneberg-Jensen, died following a 100km team time trial due to a combination of doping and exposure. He became only the second person to die during the Olympic Games, after the death of the Portugese marathon runner Francisco Lazaro in 1912.         
	Mistake         
	American swimmer Lance Larson was robbed of the 100m freestyle title after a controversial race in Rome. Although two electronic devices recorded that Larson touched home ahead of John Devitt, judges awarded the gold medal to the Australian. The Americans disputed the decison for four years but the ruling was never overturned.         
	Africa         
	The Rome marathon was run at night. The Ethiopian Abebe Bikila, a soldier at the Imperial palace of Haile Selassie, won gold after covering the 26 miles running barefoot. He crossed the line at exactly the same spot where, 25-years earlier, Mussolini had deployed his troops for their colonialist campaign in Ethiopia.         
	Longevity         
	The sabre-fencing competitor, Hungarian Aladar Gerevich, celebrated his 50th birthday on the day he won gold in the team event. This was his tenth Olympic medal, his seventh gold. Twenty-four years separated his first medal, won in 1936 in Berlin, from his last. His father-in-law, Albert Bogen, had previously won the silver medal in the sabre team event for Austria in 1912. His wife, Eva Bogathy, won the bronze in the individual foil fencing event in 1932 and his son won the bronze in 1972 and 1980 in the individual sabre event.         
	Blessing         
	Pope Jean XXIII was present to give his papal blessing to a thousand athletes in Saint Pauls square before the beginning of the competitions. He watched the semi-finals of the canoe-kayak event from the windows of his home in Verano.         
	Versatility         
	The American weightlifter of Japanese origin, Tommy Kono, won the silver medal in the middleweight division. He took his third consecutive Olympic medal but, uniquely, all three were in different weight categories: (1952 lightweight, 1956 light-heavyweight). Outside the Olympic arena Kono was twice voted Mr Universe.               
	EXPLOIT         
	The image of Abebe Bikilas arrival, winner of the 1960 Olympic marathon in Rome running barefoot, will always remain engraved in golden letters in the history of the Games. The 28-year-old Ethiopian, an Imperial guardsman to Emperor Haile Selassie, became the first black African to reach the highest point on the Olympic winners podium.               
	SUMMARY         
	The image of barefoot Ethiopian Abebe Bikila running to victory in the marathon, passing the vestiges of Romes once truly glorious splendour, lent the 1960 Olympics a nostalgic link between history and modernity as the first Games to be exposed to mass market TV.         
	Rome is widely held to be one of Europes most beautiful cities and organisers made spectacular use of this quality when choosing where to locate events.         
	Turkish wrestlers took seven golds in the sumptuous surroundings of the Maxence Basilica while the Soviets took 15 of a possible 16 medals in gymnastics at a site by the Caracalla Thermal baths.         
	The Eternal City can boast to have staged one of the greatest ever Games. The hosts came third in the medals table and the Olympic movement later declared deep satisfaction with how things had gone.         
	One of the Games heroes came in the form of African-American Wilma Rudolph, the 21st of a 22 child family who overcame polio at the age of nine to go on and win the 100m, 200m and 4x100m golds in Rome, where local papers nicknamed her the Black Gazelle.         
	The mens sprint titles traditionally went to Americans but in Rome, Germanys Armin Hary won the 100m dash and to the ecstatic cheers of the delirious home crowds Livio Berrutti, an Italian, won the 200m gold.         
	Other memorable feats included the beating of Jesse Owens long-jump record after it had stood some 25 years. Americas Ralph Boston finally breaking the spell with a jump of 8.21m.         
	Two antipodean middle distance runners also broke onto the scene. Peter Snell from New Zealand bagged the 800m gold and Australian Herb Elliott the 1500m.         
	In the Olympic pool the Americans recovered from the Melbourne edition four years previous and the Australian raid on medals by winning nine gold as opposed to five by the Aussies.         
	On the hockey field India let the gold slip for the very first time losing out to their bitter rivals and northern neighbours Pakistan.         
	Motor-mouthed American boxer Cassius Clay launched his memorable career at the Rome Games winning gold in the light-heavyweight division.         
	Clay, later a renowned civil rights orator, threw his gold medal in a river on his return to the US after being refused admission to a whites only restaurant in the racist segregation marred America of that time.

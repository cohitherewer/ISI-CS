The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punjab hold edge over Chennai
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Punjab hold edge over Chennai
                      
	Mumbai: With Shaun Marsh in awesome touch and the combination of other players they possess, Kings XI Punjab have a distinct edge over Chennai Super Kings when the two teams clash in the second semi-final of the Indian Premier League at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday.         
	The left-handed opener from Western Australia stole the thunder from all batsmen and has been a real revelation for the fans of the game with his superb batting style, classical cricketing shots being its cornerstone.         
	He appears as a major stumbling block in front of the Chennai side as he emerged as the highest run-getter (593 runs from 10 games) in the competition despite not playing in the initial part of the 59-day event.         
	The strength of Punjab lies in the fantastic array of batsmen they have apart from Marsh who has been opening the innings of late with Australian all rounder James Hopes.         
	In Sri Lankans Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, the team possesses two of the finest talents in the world.         
	Punjab also have Yuvraj, who has surprisingly underperformed in a format which he dominated thoroughly in the inaugural World Cup last September in South Africa which India won, and the dangerous Luke Pomersbach to add meat to the middle order.         
	Marsh, given a reprieve by Robin Uthappa early on, took the match away from Mumbai Indians at the same venue on May 21 in the company of Pomersbach and Chennai Super Kings will be wary of the duos abilities to score at a fast clip.         
	The very strong Punjab batting is backed up by efficient bowling manned by Sreesanth, Irfan Pathan, V.R.V. Singh and Piyush Chawla, giving the team a truly formidable look.         
	Chennai Super Kings, who finished third in the points table behind Rajasthan and Punjab do have the wherewithal to compete against their rivals, but man for man they fall a bit short.         
	They certainly will feel the absence of former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming at the top of the order. He has gone home to be with his wife whos expecting a child and in his absence Parthiv Patel is expected to open the innings with S Vidyut or Anirudha Srikkanth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arshavin return to bolster Russia
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arshavin return to bolster Russia
                      
	Innsbruck: Russia can unlock the most dangerous weapon from their arsenal when playmaker Andrei Arshavin returns from suspension to face Sweden in their decisive Euro 2008 group D match on Wednesday.         
	Russia need to win at the Tivoli-Neu stadium in Innsbruck to book a quarter final spot, while a draw would do for Sweden.         
	Arshavin, widely considered Russias top player, sat out their first two matches  a 1-4 defeat by Spain and a 1-0 win over Greece  and is expected to now take charge of the attack.         
	Arshavin is a footballer who can make something out of nothing, a daily newspaper quoted coach Guus Hiddink as saying.         
	Despite the praise, Hiddink has hinted that 27-year-old Arshavin may not get an automatic place in the lineup.         
	I dont know whether he (Arshavin) will play or not, Russian media quoted the Dutchman as saying.         
	Sweden coach Lars Lagerback is likely to make just one change from the side beaten 1-2 by Spain with Niclas Alexandersson returning at fullback after recovering from a thigh strain in place of Fredrik Stoor.         
	Johan Elmander should start on the right side of midfield despite a niggling foot injury.         
	Sweden struggled in the latter part of both their games, so Lagerback will need to choose his substitutions carefully.           (REUTERS)

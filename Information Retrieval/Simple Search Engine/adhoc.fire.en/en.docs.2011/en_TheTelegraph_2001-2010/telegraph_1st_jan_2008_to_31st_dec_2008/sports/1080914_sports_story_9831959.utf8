                                                                                                                                                                                                     Roma lose to Palermo
                      
	Rome: Fabrizio Miccoli struck twice as Palermo beat injury-hit AS Roma 3-1 at home in Serie A on Saturday to give new coach Davide Ballardini a winning start.         
	Miccoli cancelled out Brazil striker Julio Baptistas eighth-minute opener with a stunning right-footed shot into the top corner from the edge of the box .         
	The forward ran on to a Fabio Simplicio through ball and chipped home in the 57th before Uruguayan Edinson Cavani sealed the win in the 73rd after another smart pass from Simplicio. Romas injury woes worsened when Daniele De Rossi suffered a knock on his head.

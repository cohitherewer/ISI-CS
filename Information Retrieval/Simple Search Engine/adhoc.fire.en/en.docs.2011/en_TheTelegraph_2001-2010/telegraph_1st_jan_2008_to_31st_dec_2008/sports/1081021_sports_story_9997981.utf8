            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: JCT, Phagwara have decided to release Brazilian striker Marcos Pereira in favour of Mohun Bagan.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, the JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh said: Yes, we have decided to release Marcos.         
	We had no intention of spoiling the Brazilians season. All we wanted to prove that we were right in not releasing the player till now.         
	Now that the Players Status Committee of the AIFF has ruled it in our favour, we see no harm in releasing Marcos. The report of the status committee has vindicated our stand.         
	The JCT coach also said his club had every right to release the footballer as Marcos was registered with the Phagwara side for the current season in September.         
	According to the register of the Punjab Football Association (PFA) the player was enrolled for our club on September 21 this year.         
	According to JCT sources, Mohun Bagan had to shell out money to get Marcos released on loan.         
	After all, JCT had spent some money on Marcos in the last few months.         
	He was released only after the Calcutta team agreed to pay us that money, sources said.

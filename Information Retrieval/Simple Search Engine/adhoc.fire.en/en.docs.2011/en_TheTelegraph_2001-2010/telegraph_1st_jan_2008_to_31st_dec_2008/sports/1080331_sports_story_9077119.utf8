            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Graeme Smith was happy with the way his team bounced back on the fourth day of the first Test. He also said that he was hoping for a balanced pitch in Ahmedabad.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The first Test         
	We had set up the game well and I think it needed an incredible innings and India got that. I think if Virender (Sehwag) had been out for 200, we would have had an opportunity to have a go at India. It was a good batting track. Even though its ended in a draw its set up things very nicely for the next game. Weve learnt a few things and hopefully can make it count for us in Ahmedabad.         
	Dale Steyns bowling         
	I was very happy with the way we performed Saturday. We learnt a lot from Day III when Virender played superbly. I think all three seamers bowled really well on Day IV. There was a lot of reverse swing on the fourth day. Many of my boys are here for the first time.         
	The positives         
	Im very happy with the way the top six have performed. Hashim (Amla) has played superbly Hes taken his game to a new level and is looking sound technically and mentally. Ill love to see him build on from where he is now, get better and better. Neil (McKenzie) is quite an experienced cricketer Weve brought him back to open and hes added value to our team.         
	On tackling spinners in the subcontinent         
	I think weve dealt with spin pretty well this season  in Pakistan, Bangladesh and here. In terms of our capabilities of tackling spin  technique, game plan, etc.,  we are pretty sound. Weve probably surprised a few of you Weve generally proven we can play it well.

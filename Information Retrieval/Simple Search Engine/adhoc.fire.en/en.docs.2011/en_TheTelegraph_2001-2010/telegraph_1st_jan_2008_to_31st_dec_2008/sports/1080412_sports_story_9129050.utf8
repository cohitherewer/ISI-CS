            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Course-favourite Antenor trounced the opposition in the 1,400m Mica Empress Cup, the main event in Fridays card which brought the curtain down on the winter season. In the process, the 16-10 course-favourite complimented his mentor, trainer Harvinder Singh Bath, for putting together a lame horse to produce a champion-like performance. Jockey Neeraj Rawal partnered the Royal Kingdom to a seven-length-plus victory over the lowly weighted Royal Dazzle.          
	Like all good things, the 30-day season came to a fitting end with all sections of the sport having nothing to complain about. The season had started on a sedate note but grew stronger with every passing week prompting even the bitterest RCTC critic to acknowledge the changing face of the city racing.           
	Nevertheless, afternoon also witnessed a priced double scored by two professionals  Vikash Jaiswal and Errol Bhungard thorough Gallant Commander, El Cid, Starlite and Master Marvel in their respective events.

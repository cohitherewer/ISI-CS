	Bangalore: Test captain Anil Kumble, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and V. V. S. Laxman were Saturday declared fit for the upcoming Test series against South Africa starting on March 26 in Chennai.         
	Pacer Rudra Pratap Singh and V.R.V. Singh also passed the fitness tests at the National Cricket Academy but Rajasthan bowler Pankaj Singh was advised rest for three weeks.         
	Pankaj, who suffered a back strain in Australia, has now developed a hip strain. He was put through the three hour-long fitness assessment by trainer Paul Chapman and physio Paul Close, under the watchful eyes of NCA director of coaching Dav Whatmore.         
	Each of the six players, who were later declared fit, underwent a medical examination, beep test, body strengthening and fielding practice. The findings of the tests were sent by the NCA to the BCCI.         
	Sourav took the test Saturday morning after arriving here on Friday night.         
	The BCCI had instructed all players, who featured in the Test series in Australia but not in the tri-series, to undergo the fitness tests. The national selectors meet on March 17 to pick the squad for the first Test.

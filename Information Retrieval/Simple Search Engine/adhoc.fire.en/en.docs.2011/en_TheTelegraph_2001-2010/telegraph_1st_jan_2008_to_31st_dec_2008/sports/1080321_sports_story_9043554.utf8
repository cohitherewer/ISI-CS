The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India, Pak in same group 
                                                   India, Pak in same group 
                      
	Lahore: India have been grouped with hosts Pakistan for the Asia Cup to be held in June and July this year. The arch rivals have been pooled with minnows Hong Kong in group B, while defending champions Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and United Arab Emirates form the other pool for the ninth edition of the tournament, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) announced Thursday.         
	Despite Australia postponing their scheduled tour of Pakistan citing security concerns, all teams have confirmed their availability for the Asia Cup, to be held from June 24 to July 6. All the participating nations have confirmed their participation and we hope to have a safe and highly competitive Asia Cup in three months time, ACC chief executive Ashraful Huq told reporters.         
	Hosts Sri Lanka won the eighth edition in 2004 but the tournament could not be held as per schedule in 2006 due to the hectic international schedule. Huq denied the tournament was ever in doubt after the Aussies refused to tour.         
	The Australians are unaware of our culture and they dont have an idea that no sporting activity has ever been hurt in Asia. All the teams are going to take part barring any major disaster, he said.         
	The three sides in each group play each other once, with the top two teams from each group qualifying for the second phase, where they will again play each other once. The top two teams will contest the final.         
	Karachi will host 10 of the 13 matches, while Lahore will host three and all matches will be day-night affairs, starting late in the afternoon, Huq said. The first Asia Cup was held in 1984. India have won the event four times, while Sri Lanka have lifted the Cup thrice and Pakistan once.         
	The PCB said that they will provide maximum security for visiting teams.         
	We have always provided the same security to visiting teams that is normally reserved for heads of state. We will do the same during the Asia Cup, chairman Nasim Ashraf said.         
	The ACC president, Arjuna Ranatunga, who is also president of the Sri Lanka Cricket, told reporters that he had no qualms about sending his team to Pakistan.         
	We are not very much concerned about the (security) situation here because we have gone through such situations back home, Ranatunga said.         
	All the participating countries (in the Asia Cup) have given us the green light, and they are willing to come to Pakistan, he said.         
	Ranatunga said that in the event Pakistan could not host the tournament, Sri Lanka could be the alternate venue.           (AGENCIES)

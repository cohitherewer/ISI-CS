(PTI)                           
	Bangalore: Boxing Day turned out to be special for Manoj Tiwary. Having set himself a goal at the beginning of the season, the live-wire batsman put his hand up when it mattered most for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy quarter finals against Tamil Nadu at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here Friday.         
	Talking about his unbeaten 134, Tiwary said his ninth first-class century was special.         
	This innings is special for me as it came at the time when the team needed someone to put up a big score. Also, I had set myself a goal at the start of the season of achieving something big. I am glad that I made a contribution today, the batsman said.         
	Obviously, scoring a hundred is great. But when you score one against a good bowling attack it gives greater satisfaction, said Tiwary.         
	Asked if he rated Fridays hundred as his best, the 22-year-old said: This was a good innings but I rate the 210 that I made against Mumbai in Calcutta as my best so far.         
	He praised Wriddiman Saha and Dibyendu Chakraborty for their contributions.         
	It feels nice to see young batsmen perform. Wriddhiman and Dibyendu did a wonderful job for the side today. We know we have the potential and we believe that we can do better. Moreover everyone is positive and have been contributing. That is a good sign.         
	Tiwary was looking forward to prolonging his vigil at the wicket. I am looking forward to bat out the first session tomorrow. If we can extend our total, it could give us a chance of challenging Tamil Nadu, signed off Tiwary, whose association with the Indian team was cut short by a back injury.

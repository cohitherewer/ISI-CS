      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Perth: Top gun Matthew Hayden, who has been forced to miss the third Test owing to a hamstring injury, is hopeful of being fit for the fourth and final face-off  in Adelaide, from January 24. 
    
	Cant say for sure, but Im hoping to be available for Adelaide, he told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 
    
	Haydens berth has gone to rookie Chris Rogers, a Western Australian. Both, incidentally, had a short interaction with the media. 
    
	Here goes: 
    
	HAYDEN: Personally, Im very disappointed at missing the Test... Its going to be a really special one but, from my point of view, I couldnt look at the skipper in the eye and say I was going to be fully fit... It provides a great opportunity to Rogers... A home Test is always a very, very special one and I want to wish him the very best... We take enormous pride in wearing the Baggy Green and this wont be an exception. So, congratulations to him. 
    
	ROGERS: Im excited, but first commiserations to Matt... I know he wanted to be part of this Test, wanted to be part of trying to make history... Personally, its an amazing feel... Its a fantastic opportunity... Id been dreaming about it for quite a while and it has finally come my way... I hope to do the Baggy Green proud... Ill always remember making my debut in front of my home crowd... You never want to wish an injury to anybody, but that chance is there and I feel for Matt.

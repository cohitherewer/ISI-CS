            GAME 2 REVIEW                    GMSPEAK
     Pravin Thipsay    
	The second day of the Viswanathan Anand-Vladimir Kramnik World Championship match saw another thrilling and exciting game on Wednesday. This time Kramnik, the challenger, created most of the thrill by trying to get the defending champion on the ropes. However, despite a sharp and double-edged battle, the second game also ended without a result.         
	Both players seemed to be in an extremely belligerent mood. Anand surprised the chess world by starting the game with the queen pawn opening, which he has done only a handful of times before. As expected, Kramnik countered with his favourite Nimzo Indian defence, named after the legendary pre-World War II Soviet master Aron Nimzovich.         
	Anand opted for an extremely sharp continuation but was already out of preparation when Kramnik chose a little-known option as early as on move eight. Kramniks ninth move was actually an innovation or a novelty in chess terms. This move led to a very wild position with chances to both sides.         
	Anand is basically an attacking player with a straightforward and classical style. He is famous for his sound style and liking for the compact pawn structure. Kramnik has a modern positional style and exemplary skills in exploiting pawn structural weaknesses in the enemy camp. But when a weakened but dynamic position appeared on the board as early as move 12 on Wednesday, it became clear that the challenger was going to be more comfortable with it than the champion.         
	On move 14, Kramnik played an aggressive continuation and caught the world champions king in the centre by preventing a castling. This forced the champion to weaken his position further, allowing the enemy queen to get to a dangerous outpost.         
	On move 18, Kramnik got the initiative by unexpectedly castling the queenside. After the forced exchange of queens Anand began a brilliant king march. Each and every move by Kramnik seemed to pose severe threats to Anands king but the champion neutralised all the threats with a precise defence.         
	After a brilliant bishop retreat on move 22, Anand was out of trouble and the position suddenly started looking dangerous for his opponent. The challenger, however, kept the initiative by adding more fuel to the position with a pawn sacrifice on move 23. Anand once again covered all his weaknesses with a brilliant defence. However, with only five minutes left on the clock for eight moves, Anand accepted Kramniks draw offer on the 32nd move in a dynamic and unclear position.         
	Anand, perhaps, could and should have tried to exploit his material superiority in the final position but Kramnik had occupied most of the important outposts in the position and it would have been really difficult for the Indian to make any real progress, particularly due to the time scarcity.         
	 The choice of opening by Kramnik in Wednesdays game reflects very highly and positively on his team of trainers and seconds. Every one knows that Anand does not like to defend and this is precisely what he was compelled to do. I feel that chess players should generally avoid playing positions that do not suit their personalities or playing styles. Though objectively Anand was in a satisfactory position throughout the game, one wonders if he actually enjoyed playing his position on Wednesday!         
	The third game will be played on Friday, after a rest day. We will have to wait and see how Kramnik tries to crack Anands Slav defence.

	New York: Dinara Safinas pursuit of a maiden Grand Slam title gathered momentum on Monday when she defeated German qualifier Anna-Lena Groenefeld 7-5, 6-0 to reach the US Open quarter finals.         
	Groenefeld tried her best to rattle Safina when she stormed back from 4-2 down in the opening set to level at 5-5.         
	But that ended up being the last game the 141st ranked Groenefeld won as Safina pounded down a string of sizzling ground strokes to win in 75 minutes.         
	The Russian will next face either former world number one Amelie Mauresmo or Flavia Pennetta.         
	In the mens draw Mardy Fish ruined Gael Monfilss 22nd birthday celebrations by handing the French 32nd seed a 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 drubbing in their fourth round tie.         
	Monfils would have hoped to mark his big day by reaching the quarter finals at Flushing Meadows for the first time. Instead it was Fish who celebrated a personal landmark.                 
	Monfils took an injury timeout while trailing 0-3 in the second set to get his right leg strapped just under his knee but that failed to change his fortunes and he bowed out by slamming a forehand into the net.         
	Fish will face either top seed Rafael Nadal or fellow-American Sam Querrey in the next round.         
	On Sunday Novak Djokovic had illuminated New Yorks midnight hour with an electrifying performance, surviving a 234-minute battle to reach the fourth round of the US Open.         
	The Serbian third seed soaked up the full force of Marin Cilics armoury to stay in the hunt for the title with an absorbing 6-7, 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 victory in a contest that ended at 12.48 am local time.         
	The 21-year-old squandered two match points in the 10th game of the fourth set but roared through the last 11 points of the match to seal the win when Cilic dragged a service return wide.         
	Thanks everybody for staying so late for us. I had a very very difficult match and even if I lost today (Sunday), he would have deserved it. He played great, Djokovic said.         
	Cilic, 19, kept up the intensity throughout but eventually was undone by his lack of experience, cracking down 12 double faults to undo his hard work.         
	Djokovics next test will be against 15th seed Tommy Robredo.         
	While Djokovic kept the midnight oil burning on Sunday, Roger Federer and Jelena Jankovic were enjoying an early night, thanks to their relatively smooth progress during the day session.         
	After a week of lukewarm performances, four-time champion Federer turned on the heat with a masterful 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 destruction of Czech 28th seed Radek Stepanek.         
	Womens world number two Jankovic looked to be heading for another long workout but found her range to end the plucky challenge of Danish teenager Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round with a 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 victory.         
	As temperatures soared on day seven of the hardcourt major, an ailing Marion Bartoli said it was a miracle she could battle on for more than three hours in the stifling conditions. She eventually fell 6-7, 6-0, 4-6 to Austrian Sybille Bammer.         
	I had very low blood pressure and very weak pulse and the trainer advised me not to continue, especially because it was so hot, said the 12th seed.         
	While Bartoli wilted under sunny skies, Federer flourished.         
	In his first two matches, the Swiss master had fallen well short of proving his title credentials as he piled up 66 unforced errors and converted only 11 of 28 break points.         
	He dazzled Stepanek and 23,000 wide-eyed fans on Arthur Ashe Stadium court when his game clicked into overdrive.         
	At one point, the Swiss even managed to surprise himself. With his back pinned to the rear wall, Federer leapt high into the air and his slam-dunk mis-hit bounced off a startled Stepaneks racket frame for a winner.         
	After toying with Stepanek for 96 minutes, Federer threaded a forehand down the line to seal victory and celebrated by punching the air and holding aloft his index finger, as if to remind people Im still No. 1 in New York.         
	Federer chalked up his 30th consecutive victory here to set up a meeting with Russias Igor Andreev.         
	Another Russian, Elena Dementieva, continued to slice through the draw with a ruthless 6-4, 6-1 win over Chinas Li Na. Next up for her is Swiss 15th seed Patty Schnyder.

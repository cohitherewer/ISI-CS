	Jaipur: Riding on a sensational best ever bowling spell of Twenty20 by Pakistani left-arm pacer Sohail Tanvir, Rajasthan Royals cantered to an easy eight-wicket win over Chennai Super Kings in an IPL match on Sunday.         
	Tanvir bagged six wickets in his four-over spell to end the Chennai innings for a paltry 109 after the visitors chose batting winning the toss.         
	And while chasing, the hosts, were never in trouble and romped home with 34 balls to spare. Openers Graeme Smith (35 not out; 44 balls, 4x4) and Swapnil Asnodkar (32; 30 balls, 5x4) put on 78 runs for the first wicket to set up the win and place his team on top of the table.         
	Smith hit the winning runs off Muttiah Muralidharan for a two to bring up 110 for the home sides fifth win on the trot and hand Mahendra Singh Dhonis team their second consecutive loss.         
	Earlier, a sensational bowling spell of six for 14 by left-arm pacer Sohail Tanvir helped Rajasthan Royals skittle Chennai Super Kings for a low total. Tanvirs unbelievable 4-0-14-6 was the first five-wicket haul and also the best figure of the IPL so far.         
	He was ably supported by Munaf Patel (2/16), Shane Watson (1/19) and captain Shane Warne (1/29) in completely destroying the Super Kings batsmen.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We were outplayed, says Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We were outplayed, says Ponting
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: Australian captain Ricky Ponting admitted they were completely outplayed by the Indians in all aspects of the game and said it was probably his worst Test as captain.               
	The following are excerpts               
	If it was his worst Test as captain         
	Possibly yes I didnt have enough time to reflect on it but what I can say is that we were on the back-foot right from the first morning. We didnt get the start we needed and they took away the momentum from us. We were always under pressure and could not bat our way back into the game.         
	What made the difference         
	When opponents score 460-plus in their first innings, you have to make sure you match that score in your first innings. But we came up a couple of hundreds short. We were completely outplayed in every aspect of the game whether in our fast bowling, spin-bowling or batting.         
	Brett Lees performance         
	Brett and Hayden are champion players. And one thing about champion players is that you can never write them off. I am sure they will find a way in the remainder of the series to go out there and help the team with their impact.         
	Reverse swing         
	I think it has taken us 70-80 overs to get the reverse swing going when we are bowling but the Indians are getting the ball to reverse within 6-8 overs. Thats a huge difference in the game.         
	Controversy surrounding Lee         
	I think it seems I will have to clarify that quite a bit. When I met Brett, I informed him you are not going to bowl first thing in the morning. I think it panned out because I informed the reasons to Brett around 11 in the morning, when he wanted to bowl. There was nothing between us. Cant make it any clearer. There was nothing else between us.         
	Whats been wrong with Lee         
	There is nothing wrong with him. Its more of a mindset thing. His body is in good shape. He just needs some fine-tuning, which he can do over the next couple of days.         
	Dhonis captaincy         
	M.S. (Dhoni) has done a brilliant job in this game. Not only with his captaincy but also the way he played in this match.         
	Being 0-1 down         
	Yeah, thats a challenge for us. We are not accustomed to being 0-1 down in a series Not accustomed to being beaten the way we have been in this match.         
	On the role of the spinners         
	I have to take what we have got. Our strategies would be more centred around the pacers. The spinners will do a reasonable job when they can We dont have a match-winner spinner in our side at present.         
	Lack of experience         
	With Stuart Clark out of the side, the side looked more inexperienced. I think Siddle did a reasonable job and will only get better.         
	Pacers doing the job for India         
	We expected that quite a bit. Thats what international crickets all about. Ishant and Zaheer are two great bowlers. They have got the better of us in the first two Tests. We have to find out ways of handling them better in the next two Tests.         
	Anybody other than Ishant who has troubled him much         
	(Grins) Harbhajan probably Ishants been bowling great. The delivery he got me out with in the second innings I will get out to that 95 times out of hundred. The swing he gets The angle he creates. We have to try and make it more difficult for the bowlers.         
	The aggression from the Indians         
	I think they are playing a more aggressive brand of cricket. The way they are batting The way they are bowling The way they are talking. It all started with Sehwags innings on the first day and they maintained that brand of cricket all through.

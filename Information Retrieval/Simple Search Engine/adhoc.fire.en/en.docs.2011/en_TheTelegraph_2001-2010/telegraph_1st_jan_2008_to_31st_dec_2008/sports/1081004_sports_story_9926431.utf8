The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Peter Kirsten too at work
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Peter Kirsten too at work
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: While the eyes of the cricketing world will be on Gary Kirsten next week as India take on Australia in a much-awaited Test series, the rest of the Kirsten family will hope the other two sons can coach their sides to the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011.         
	This weekend, Peter Kirsten will try and help Jersey, a tiny island between England and France, with a population of 90,000 people, on the road to qualification for Asia in 2011.         
	Jersey will be joined by Afghanistan, Fiji, Hong Kong, Italy and hosts Tanzania for a tournament that involves 18 matches over eight days.         
	If Peter and his players can take that step, in the Pepsi ICC World Cricket League Division 4 in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, that would take the Jersey closer to a potential meeting with Kenya, coached by another brother, Andy Kirsten, in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier in April next year.         
	For that to happen, Jersey will have to finish in the top two of the six teams in action in Africa.         
	That will send it to the Division 3 event in January 2009 and that will be one step from the 12-team Qualifier featuring the likes of Canada, Kenya and Scotland.

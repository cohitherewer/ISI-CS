	New Delhi: Mahendra Singh Dhonis leadership has changed the face of Indian cricket, according to Wasim Akram who believes it is a matter of time before India upstage Australia as the number one team in the world.         
	Akram said Dhoni has completely transformed the team ever since he took over the mantle of captaincy and that Indian cricket was on the right track with a number of talented players in their ranks.         
	Dhoni has changed the face of Indian cricket, there is no doubt about that. He leads from the front, he has charisma and players like him. You cant ask for anything more, Akram said.         
	He has given the team confidence. The players now believe that they can go and beat any team and it is this confidence that has helped India bring about the desired results, the former Pakistan captain said.         
	Akram said Dhoni had also brought about a refreshing change in his attitude and approach to matches.         
	But former Pakistan captain Younis Khan is not so much impressed by Dhonis success. Younis said in Karachi on Tuesday: I would like to see how he fares and handles the pressure when the luck runs out. That will be his real test.

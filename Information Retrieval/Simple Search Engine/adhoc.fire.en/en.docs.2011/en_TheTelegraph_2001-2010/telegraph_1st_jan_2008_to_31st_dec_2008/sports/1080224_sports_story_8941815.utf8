            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Poor strategy adopted by the opposition resulted in an easy victory for the Vijay Singh-trained Alterio (C.Alford-up) in the 2,800m Calcutta St Leger, the main event in Saturdays race-card. The winner was allowed to dictate the terms right from the start by trainer Daniel Davids duo of Steal The Glory and Star Team, the 7-10 hot favourite. Alford, therefore, maneuvered the pace to his advantage and scored.          
	David, however, went on to claim the S. Rahamatulla Memorial Cup and the Governors Cup through Triple Edge and Mustang Royal  both rank outsiders. The Police Commissioners Cup was lifted by Supreme Attraction.

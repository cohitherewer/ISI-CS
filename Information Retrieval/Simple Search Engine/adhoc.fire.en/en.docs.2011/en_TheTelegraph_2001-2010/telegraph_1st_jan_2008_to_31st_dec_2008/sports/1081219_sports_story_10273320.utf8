The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tour of Pakistan officially called off
                                                                                                                                                                                           Tour of Pakistan officially called off
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta: Indias cricket tour of Pakistan was officially called off on Thursday following a directive from the government that it was not feasible in the prevailing circumstances.         
	Questions were raised about the feasibility of the tour ever since the terror strikes in Mumbai last month and the government has conveyed to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) the reasons for cancelling the tour.         
	The final decision has been taken. We have got the letter from the sports ministry and the ministry of external affairs not to proceed with the tour, senior BCCI official Rajeev Shukla said in New Delhi.         
	The government has declined permission to go ahead with the tour taking into account the recent developments in Mumbai as well as the overall circumstances prevailing at present, he said.         
	The only option now to stage the series is to agree on a neutral venue, though Shukla said it was too early to take that call. Officials from the Abu Dhabi Cricket Council have already offered to host the series at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, where the England team trained before reaching India for the current two-Test series.         
	The government directive does not come as a surprise, with public opinion in India, as well as that of former cricketers and politicians, largely against the tour. Sports minister M. S. Gill has also said he was not in favour of the team travelling to Pakistan.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) made an official request to Sri Lanka to visit in Indias place while expressing its disappointment at the BCCIs decision.         
	We take this decision as disappointing, something which will hurt Pakistan cricket badly, but it was beyond our control, said PCB chairman Ejaz Butt. The BCCIs email has put an end to all our efforts to convince them to tour Pakistan, and now I hope that situation will improve so that bilateral ties are revived, which is very important for the region.         
	The BCCI said it was neither sad nor relieved by the government decision.         
	We are neither sad nor relieved. It was a reciprocal agreement under which they toured India and we were supposed to tour Pakistan. But the situation is now grim, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan said in Mohali.         
	We always maintained that we need permission from the central government and were told that under the circumstances, its not feasible to tour Pakistan. Hence, we cannot go there, Srinivasan said.         
	Asked if scrapping of the tour would affect preparation of the 2011 World Cup which India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are hosting together, Srinivasan said: Its still another two years before that and we have lot of time to think about that.

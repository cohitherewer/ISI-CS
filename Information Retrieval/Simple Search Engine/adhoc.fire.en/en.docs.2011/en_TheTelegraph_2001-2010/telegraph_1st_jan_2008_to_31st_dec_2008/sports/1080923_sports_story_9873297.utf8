	Calcutta/Karachi: On the backdrop of recent terrorist attack in Islamabad, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is in dilemma about whether India would like to stick to the itinerary approved by the BCCI, during their tour to the trouble-torn country early next year.         
	The PCB today failed to release the itinerary for the series with apparent doubts over having matches in Rawalpindi, the twin city of Islamabad.         
	We dont know when we will be able to release the itinerary, a PCB official said.         
	[When contacted late on Monday, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said: We have not asked for any change in the itinerary. We had approved it earlier.]         
	The PCB had announced few days back it would probably release the itinerary of the tour on Monday after it was approved by the BCCI, with a Test match and one-dayer scheduled at the renovated stadium in Rawalpindi.

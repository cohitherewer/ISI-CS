	Salzburg: Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his first international goal for more than two and a half years to send Sweden on the way to a 2-0 Euro 2008 victory over champions Greece on Tuesday (as briefly reported in Wednesdays Late City edition).         
	The striker, who last found the net for his country in October 2005, combined with partner Henrik Larsson to drive in a superb shot from the edge of the box after 67 minutes to break the deadlock in a dull game.         
	Petter Hansson scrambled the second goal five minutes later to put Sweden level on points with Spain, who beat Russia 4-1 in the other Group D game earlier.         
	Larsson laid the ball back into the path of Ibrahimovic, who struck unerringly to end a 14-game goal drought in spectacular style.         
	Hansson then somehow forced the second over the line after a goalmouth melee.

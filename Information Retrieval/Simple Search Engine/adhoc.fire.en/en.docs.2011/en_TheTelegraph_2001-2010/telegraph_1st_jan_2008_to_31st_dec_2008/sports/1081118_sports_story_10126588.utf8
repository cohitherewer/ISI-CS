The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan weighing swap option
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pakistan weighing swap option
                      
	Karachi: PCB chairman Ezaj Butt has confirmed that the option of switching the Test series with India was very much under consideration.         
	Indias tour to Pakistan is early next year and our tour to India is part of the ICC Future Tours programme and can be swapped (in case India cancel the tour), he said.         
	If the Indians come on schedule it will also mean we can host the Champions Trophy. So our priority remains to convince them to come. The PCB will be asking the government to take up this issue at the government level and make the tour possible.         
	He said instead of switching the 2009 series to a neutral venue, Pakistan would give more weightage to the option of shifting the series to India.         
	The Indians are due to play three Tests, five one-dayers and a one-off Twenty20 game in Pakistan from the first week of January.         
	However, the cancellation of Indias junior hockey team tour to Pakistan on security issues has put a question mark over Indian cricket teams visit to the strife-torn nation.         
	Butt also said Shoaib Malik might have led Pakistan to a convincing 3-0 whitewash against the West Indies, but as decided earlier, a review of his leadership qualities will be done.         
	Malik has done well but his captaincy tenure ends in December. We will sit down and review his performance and decide for the future, Butt said. (PTI)

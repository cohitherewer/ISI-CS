            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Vijay Mallya-led United Spirits Ltd is planning to launch a football league on the lines of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Though no senior United Spirits official could confirm the exact nature of the league planned, the company is believed to be looking to make football appealing through a new format.         
	The officials of various clubs, including Mohun Bagan, Salgaocar, JCT and Air India, however said that no one has so far approached them in this regard.         
	Both Fifa and the AFC have already trained eyes on India, in a bid to cash in on its huge market. The AFC is also funding the Vision India project.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An India series dwarfs Ashes, feels Katich
                                                                                                                                                                                                     An India series dwarfs Ashes, feels Katich
                      
	New Delhi: Australian batsman Simon Katich reckons his teams rivalry against India has become bigger than the Ashes in recent times.         
	Katich, who is currently in India, leading the Australia A team, said beating India at home in 2004 was one of the greatest victories for Australia.         
	Asked whether a series against India was bigger than the Ashes, Katich said: Definitely. I feel the hard-fought series in 2001, when India won that Test match in Calcutta after being down in the dumps, triggered this fascinating rivalry.         
	Later we beat India in their own backyard in 2004 after 35 odd years and got the much-desired revenge. It was one of the greatest victories for us, he told a website.         
	Recalling the tour of 2004, he said the Australian fast bowlers did a fantastic job getting the ball to reverse. That definitely helped us beat the Indians, he remarked. (PTI)

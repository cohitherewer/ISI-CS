The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes relies on good karma
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Paes relies on good karma
  - The pressure is on us to deliver... I can say with confidence that we will, says Davis Cup captain       MADHUMITA GANGULY                  Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes                                 
	Beijing: The heat is unbearable, scorching those sitting even in the shade, watching, as Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi put in rigorous practice at the Olympic Green Tennis Center on Saturday.         
	The duo are drenched in sweat as they exchange shots with South Africans Jeff Coetzee and Kevin Anderson. The tennis events begin on Sunday, though no Indians take to the courts on Day I.         
	It should be a memorable Olympics for both Paes, for whom this is the fifth Games and Bhupathi, who is playing his fourth (teaming up with Paes in all four).         
	A formidable team for five years which claimed 22 ATP titles (and two more after their break-up) including three Grand Slams, the duo parted ways in March 2002. The world No.1 pair of 1999 has not played on a regular basis in the last six years, but whenever they joined hands, theyve produced magic.         
	They bickered bitterly at the Asian Games, traded charges against each other, one revolted against the other in Davis Cup and vowed not to team up ever again. But at the end of the day, here they are in Beijing, driven by a common ambition: an Olympic medal.         
	He was a mere 19-year-old when Paes embarked on his crusade. Its been a long journey. Has the world and the Games changed in the interim?         
	Beijing had hosted the Asian Games in 1990 and from that time to this, the changes have been mind-boggling, Paes told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	The facilities are so much better (though, of course, the pollution is worse, he said in an aside), the infrastructure amazing, all the venues are located nearby  the National Stadium, the tennis and archery centres, the hockey stadium. Its brilliant. Im very impressed, Paes could hardly stop raving.         
	Have the athletes changed over the years?         
	See, Ive been around for 21 years, which is a long time I have seen the Games evolve, as have the athletes. Such changes are not noticed when one is around for say 6-7 years.         
	The training facilities today are futuristic and unbelievable. The athletes are so much more stronger and fitter than ever before.         
	Bhupathi feels that all sportspersons, worldwide, are always driven by the desire to excel, to get that elusive gold, the chance for which comes once every four years.         
	Also, since the venue changes, the hosts go all out to impress the world with their hospitality and organisational acumen.         
	What he finds interesting is the chance to get close to the varied cultures.         
	Paes revels in the experience that each edition brings.         
	Like see here in the village dining room, I come across 10,000 athletes. The range is so interesting! A 12-13 year old gymnast may just be four feet high and at the opposite end of the spectrum, we have a basketball star, a Yao Ming, who is over 7 feet! Yesterday, I came across a Puerto Rican boxer who was HUGE, like a HULK, said Indias Davis Cup captain, eyes dancing with childlike glee.         
	The duo, seeded seventh here, have an easy opener versus Frenchmen Gael Monfils and Gilles Simon. Bhupathi has, however, hit out at the draw, saying said it was unfortunate that some good doubles teams will be ousted in the first round just because the International Tennis Federation (ITF) was not consistent in seedings rules.         
	Bhupathi objected to seedings given to singles specialist players while some good teams will face-off in the first round and get eliminated.         
	According to ITF rules, teams can be seeded based on the players singles or doubles ranking at the Olympics while in other tournaments, only the doubles ranking applies.         
	Mahesh is right, agreed Paes. The draw is top heavy. Federer-Warwinka, Nadal-Robredo, Bryan brothers are all weighted on one side. But then, its also true that youve got to beat the best teams in order to reach a medal. Isnt it?         
	Yes, the pressure is on us to deliver and I can say with confidence that we will. Having an Olympic singles bronze in my repertoire, the desire to add a doubles medal is strong.         
	But you know, its all in ones karma If the karma is right, well get the medal, concludes Paes with a grin.

	Kochi: Anju Bobby Georges remarks that P.T. Usha had not been a world-class athlete has upset the Payyoli Express causing the latter to retaliate by calling the long jumper just a child.     
	Anju, in a television interview, had said she did not consider Usha a world-class athlete. She hinted that Usha only finished fourth in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics 400m hurdles because of the boycott by athletes from the erstwhile USSR.    
	I look up to only world standard athletes, Anju had said in the interview. Milkha Singh and Usha are only Asian level athletes. Usha said: India is expecting a medal from Anju at the Beijing Olympics. If I reply to her comments, that will hurt her. I am not prepared to put her in such a mental state.

	Beijing: An analysis conducted on Beijings air quality indicated some risk to athletes in outdoor endurance events such as road cycling and marathon, but that results are better than expected, an International Olympic Committee official said Monday.    
	Arne Ljungqvist, the chair of the IOC Medical Commission, said endurance events lasting more than an hour could expose participants to breathing problems, but the overall findings showed that conditions will be good for athletes during the Games. The risk is more related to the fact that they may not perform at the best level, he said.         
	Melbourne: The Australian Grand Prix wont be held under lights, despite comments from Formula One head Bernie Ecclestone that the race needs a floodlit future. On Monday, Victorian state leader Premier John Brumby ruled out a night race, but said his government would do everything possible to keep the Grand Prix in Melbourne.         
	New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan guided Team India to a ninth-place finish in the feature race in the A1 Grand Prix in Mexico City on Sunday.

	Team Ireland, the feature race winner, enjoyed their first ever A1 GP win. Oliver Jarvis, who blitzed the feature, beat sprint race winner Alex Yoong of Team Malaysia.    
	In the sprint race, Team India had a difficult start at 18th position in the 20-minute race format that allows very little chance of overtaking. Karthikeyan drove steadily, staying out of the mid-field traffic and chaos but finished 13th.

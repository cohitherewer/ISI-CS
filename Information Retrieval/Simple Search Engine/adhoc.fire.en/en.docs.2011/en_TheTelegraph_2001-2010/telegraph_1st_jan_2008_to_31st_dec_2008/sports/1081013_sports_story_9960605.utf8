                                                                                                                                                                                             Kumble injury not serious
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Anil Kumble                           
	Bangalore: Anil Kumbles sore shoulder is not serious and he is expected to be available for the second Test in Mohali. The Team India captain missed the action for a few hours on Sunday because of the injury.         
	He returned to the field after Ricky Pontings dismissal in the Australian second innings and bowled seven overs in the last hour of play.         
	Its nothing serious... He didnt take the field as a precautionary measure. As of now hes available for Mohali. If something dramatic happens on the final day, then it is going to be different, a member of the team management said.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni led in Kumbles absence. It was learnt that the selection committee had decided at its meeting that Dhoni would be Kumbles deputy in the series. The vice-captain is generally not named in a home series.         
	It may be recalled that Virender Sehwag was the vice-captain during Indias last Test series in Sri Lanka. Dhoni had made himself unavailable for that tour.

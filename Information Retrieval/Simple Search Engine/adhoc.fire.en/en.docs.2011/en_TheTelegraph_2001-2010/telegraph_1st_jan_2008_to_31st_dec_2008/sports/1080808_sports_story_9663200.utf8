  - AFC CHALLENGE CUP
  -   Chhetri puts it past Myanmar with a stunning header         JAYDEEP BASU            Sunil Chhetri scores against Myanmar in the AFC Challenge Cup semi-final in Hyderabad on Thursday. (AP)                                 
	Hyderabad: Forty-six years ago in Jakarta, Jarnail Singh became a part of Indian soccer folklore when he headed in Indias match-winner against South Vietnam in the Asian Games semi-final.         
	He had 10 stitches on his head but it did not deter him from scoring the incredible goal.         
	On Thursday, at the Gachibowli, diminutive Indian striker Sunil Chhetri raised memories of that great victory when his stunning header against Myanmar in the 82nd minute took India to the final of the AFC Challenge Cup.         
	The Delhi boy, who has signed for East Bengal this season, suffered a deep cut on his forehead in the last match against Turkmenistan. On Thursday, he took the field with three stitches that almost covered his right eye, and yet struck the all-important goal that would remain etched in the memory for many years.         
	The goal came at a time when things were looking difficult for the hosts. The heavy shower, that broke out 15 minutes after the start of the match and continued till the end, turned the pitch into a paddy field. It was impossible to play constructive football on this pitch.         
	To make matters worse, the Indians missed some easy chances at the start of the second half and Myanmar started building up the pressure.With the midfield looking like a mini swimming pool, the match seemed to be drifting away towards extra time.         
	With only eight minutes left for the final whistle, midfielder Rennedy Singh sent a long ball for Bhaichung Bhutia inside the box. Challenged by two defenders, the Indian skipper displayed his class when he sold a dummy to his opponents on the right and then lifted the ball to the vacant area on the left.         
	Chhetri, who was rushing in, scored in a breathtaking fashion. He took a header that proved to be a weak one and the ball did not travel much. As the ball was coming down, Chhetri leaped high to meet the ball again and this time it went into the net in a flash.         
	But if Chhetri became the darling of the crowd, who waited patiently outside the dressing room to have a glimpse of the striker after the tie, goalkeeper Subrata Paul could easily be called the unofficial man of the match. He was at his dazzling best on the slushy ground and saved India from going into arrears on at least two occasions.         
	The one he saved in the 15th minute was perhaps the best in the tournament. The curling shot from Paing Yan had goal written all over it, but Paul flew to the right to make a fabulous save.         
	If Chhetri and Bhutia wasted chances for India, Myanmar, too, had their share of missed opportunities. But they could not make any dent in the Indian defence as Surkumar Singh, Gourmangi Singh and Anwar Ali stood tall in their respective positions.         
	India will meet Tajikistan in the final who beat North Korea 1-0.

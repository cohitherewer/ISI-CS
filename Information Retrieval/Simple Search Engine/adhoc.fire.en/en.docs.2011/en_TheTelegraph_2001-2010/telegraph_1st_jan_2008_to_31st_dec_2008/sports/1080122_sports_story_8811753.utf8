                                                      Rahul Dravid could be asked to open again

 - Possibility of India fielding 5 bowlers

	Adelaide: Its not confirmed, but former captain Rahul Dravid, who scored 93 at No.3 in the first innings at the Waca, could be asked to open again mdash; this time in the fourth and final Test.
 
	Hed opened in the first two, without much success and, in the third Test, Virender Sehwag was brought back at the top of the order.
 
	Dravid as opener is a strong possibility as, otherwise, how does one accommodate Harbhajan Singh? Wasim Jaffer has been out of form throughout the series and, as none of the three medium-pacers can be dropped, excluding him looks the only way forward, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.
 
	If that does happen, then Team India will field five bowlers, including allrounder Irfan Pathan, MoM in the last Test.
 
	That Pathan looked competent with the bat, at the Waca, has given the think tank the confidence to consider playing five bowlers.
 
	The picture may become clear by Tuesday evening, after the Indians first nets ahead of the face-off which begins on Thursday.
 
	Traditionally, the Adelaide Oval is quite responsive to spin.
 
	Meanwhile, its a homecoming of sorts for manager Chetan Chauhan, whod turned out for the high profile Adelaide Cricket Club from 1983-1988.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Woods bags 14th major
    - Probably my best ever, says World No.1             Chris Dufresne            Tiger Woods with the trophy at Torrey Pines on Monday                                 
	La Jolla: In the end, he was Rocco, not Rocky. And Tiger Woods was Tiger Woods. And there were no retakes.         
	Rocco Mediate had his chance to win the 108th US Open, on the 18th green, in a playoff, on the 90th hole, at Torrey Pines. But when Mediate didnt win it  missing a 16-foot birdie putt  Woods did, as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition.         
	The playoff, even at par 71 after 18 holes, was forced into sudden death at the par-four seventh hole. Woods made par, Mediate made bogey, and it was time to exhale.         
	I threw everything I had, Mediate said, everything I had. It took 91 holes for Woods to claim his third US Open title and his 14th major championship, leaving him exhausted, relieved, somewhat surprised and only four professional major victories from matching Jack Nicklaus record of 18.         
	Its hard to believe Im in this situation, Woods, only 32, said. Unlike the fist pump Woods let loose on Sunday at No. 18 after his 12-foot slider for birdie sent the championship to Mondays playoff, his final rendering was subdued.         
	Mediate missed his par putt on No. 7, after Woods had made his, then Woods removed his hat, hugged his caddie, hugged Mediate, and savoured more than celebrated the win.         
	Woods has had plenty of major golf moments, but this week might take the rake.         
	I think this is probably the best ever, Woods said. All things considered, I dont know how I ended up in this position, to be honest with you. It wasnt as dominating as Woods 15-shot US Open win at Pebble Beach in 2000, but there might be 108 reasons why the 108th Open will remain special.         
	Woods won despite not playing even a practice round of golf since April 15 surgery on his left knee, a knee that could become Woods biggest obstacle in chasing down Nicklaus.         
	Woods won without complete control of his game. Yet, when he needed birdie at the par-five 18th on Sunday and Monday to keep playing, he made birdie.         
	Woods showed a resilient side too, rebounding after blowing a three-shot, back-nine lead. He also hit more memorable shots in a six-hole stretch Saturday  two eagles and a chip-in birdie  than some players hit in a career.         
	Woods winced and wobbled, grimaced and grappled. He was the drama king.         
	Many in the gallery, estimated by the USGA to be about 24,000, chased the players from hole to hole. It looked to be Woods in a landslide at No. 10, when he extended his lead to three. Mediate, though, kept nipping away.         
	The lead was cut to two at the par-three 11th after Woods bogeyed and Mediate made par. It shrank to one at No. 12, the 505-yard par four, when two Woods clunker shots and a thrown club led to another bogey.         
	Mediate pulled even at No. 14, a par four playing to only 269 yards Monday, when he tapped in for birdie while Woods made par. Mediate was in it to win it at the par-four 15th, but only after Woods upstaged Mediates second shot to 20 feet with a 170-yard blast, out of a fairway bunker, to 15 feet. Mediate shook his head  Unreal, he said later  but answered by draining his birdie putt while Woods made only par.         
	Mediate had a one-shot lead three holes from becoming the oldest US Open winner.         
	Three holes from pulling the biggest Open upset since Jack Fleck beat Ben Hogan in 1955. Three holes from comparisons to 1913, when 20-year-old amateur Francis Ouimet put American golf on the map with his upset win over Harry Vardon and Ted Ray.         
	Mediate held steady until the 18th, when his drive into the left bunker forced a layup on the par-five finishing hole.         
	Woods  go figure  needed only two clean swipes to get within 30 feet of eagle.         
	Mediates third shot, to 15 feet, produced decibel waves that shook the 18th grandstand.         
	When Woods missed his eagle putt, Mediate stood 15 feet from the rest of a different life. But he missed.         
	So the players returned to the seventh hole, where Mediate had nothing left.         
	His tee shot plopped into the left fairway bunker, and he yanked his second next to the grandstands. He got a free drop but couldnt get a wedge shot closer than 18 feet.         
	Woods, on the green in two, tapped in for par.         
	Mediate needed a minor miracle to hole his quick-breaking putt  but didnt get it. His 14th major in the bag, Woods jumped into a golf cart and was escorted down the seventh fairway as fans stormed the ropes to get a closer look.         
	Where does Woods go from here? You just keep going, he said.  there is no finish line. You keep pushing and pushing.           LAT-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India A tighten the screws
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India A tighten the screws
                      
	Bangalore: Piyush Chawla and Monish Parmar shared five wickets as India A fought back strongly and restricted Australia A to 113 for eight in their first innings on the second day of the three-day game Thursday.         
	Parmar took three for 37 while Chawla returned with two for 36 to put their side in a strong position after India were bowled out for 284 in 89.4 overs in their first innings.         
	Australia A are still trailing by 171 runs with two wickets in hand with one day remaining at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.         
	Resuming at their overnight score of 180 for four after a delayed start due to wet outfield, India could add another 104 runs before being bowled out with Mohammed Kaif top-scoring with a well-made 94.         
	Kaif hit 15 fours and a six in his 204-ball knock before being caught by Doug Bollinger off Marcus North. He was involved in a 95-run partnership for the fifth wicket with Virat Kohli, who fell for 49 (4x4; 1x6). Then came a valuable knock by Chawla who made an enterprising 66 in 85 balls with ten fours and a six.         
	Bollinger was the pick of the Australia A bowlers, grabbing four for 59 while Bryce McGain returned with three for 51. (PTI)

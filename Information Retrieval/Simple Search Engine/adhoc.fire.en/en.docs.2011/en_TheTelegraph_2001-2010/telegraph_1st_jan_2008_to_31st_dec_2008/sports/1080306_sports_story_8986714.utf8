	Calcutta: Santos FC of South Africa proved too hot for Mohun Bagan to han dle as the visitors ran away with a 4-2 verdict to move into the IFA Shield final.         
	The home team brought life into a seemingly lost cause when the South Africans were leading 3-0.         
	Bhaichung Bhutia scored one and Ishfaq Ahmed followed it up with a spectacular goal. But Santos held their nerve and took the wind out of Mohun Bagans sails by pumping in another goal .         
	Santos will take on Mahindra United in the final on Friday.         
	Having learnt a lesson early in the first half, when Bhutias header was accidentally deflected by Santos custodian Eduan Naude, the visitors were quick to make amends as they dominated the first half.         
	Danny Bowers fired Santos into the lead in the 21st minute. Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee failed to judge his kick.         
	Minutes after he apologised to his teammates for missing a sitter, Bowers set it up for Tasleem Paulse who made no mistake of making it 2-0.         
	Gregory Roelf, who was adjudged Man-of-the-Match, then added more to the Mohun Bagan misery with a 59th minute strike, taking advantage of the defensive lapse.         
	Mohun Bagan staged a spirited fightback came back through the ever-reliable Bhaichung.         
	The India captain sent the full-house into joy when he left the rival keeper Eduan Naude clueless with a move in the 66th minute.         
	Isfaq Ahmed then scored a cracker in the 81st minute, rifling in a shot after seeing the goalkeeper come out of his line.         
	Just when everybody was expecting the Mohun Bagan equaliser, Santos put paid to their plans, making it 4-2 through Jarren Moultrie.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BAYERN MUNICH
                                                                                                                                                                                                     BAYERN MUNICH
                      
	From a club that was primarily formed by a bunch of gymnast enthusiasts, led by Franz John, Bayern Munich today are one of the most successful clubs in football history. With two Intercontinental Cups, four Champions League and 21 national championships titles in their kitty, Bayern Munich are the worlds third biggest membership-based clubs. It has 140,000 members, only behind Benfica and Barcelona. They have produced a galaxy of stars, some of whom are considered the legends of football. If Franz Beckenbauer was the jewel in the crown for Bayern Munich, players such as Gerd Muller, Sepp Maier, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Lothar Matthus and Stefan Effenberg were not far behind in terms of skill and popularity.         
	Just as East Bengal are the arch rivals of Mohun Bagan, Bayerns main local rivals are TSV 1860 Munich, the more successful club in the 1960s. TSV have since moved between the first and second divisions. They are often referred to by sections of the Bayern supporters as gymnasts, insinuating a lack of footballing pedigree. The rivalry has, at least from Bayerns point of view, lost importance over the last decade reflecting the lopsided state of the achievements of the two clubs and the absence of players for whom local grudges would still matter.         
	Bayerns best years, however, came under Ottmar Hitzfeld from 1998 to 2000. He was certainly the most successful Bayern coach of all time. In Hitzfelds first season, Bayern won the Bundesliga and came agonisingly close to winning the Champions League before losing to Manchester United.         
	Next season, Bayern won their third league and cup double. A third consecutive Bundesliga title followed in 2001 and days later, Bayern claimed the Champions League title for the fourth time. But Hitzfelds reign ended in ignominy in 2004 with Bayern under-performing, including a cup defeat by second division side Alemannia Aachen.         
	Not in his wildest dreams could Franz John have imagined that in the future his team would one day be the German champions, European Cup champions and even World Club Championship winners.         
	Nor could he have imagined that nearly a century later, on a mild spring day in 1999, Beckenbauer would meet the worlds leading heads of state, and no less than the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, would whisper to him that he was the most famous person standing there.  
	BAYERN MUNICH rsquo;S KEY PLAYERS  
	Oliver Kahn  
	Nicknamed ldquo;Titan rdquo;, Kahn is arguably one of the best goalkeepers of all time. Kahn, who made his Bundesliga debut for Karlsruhe in November 1997, won eight German championships, six German cups, the UEFA Cup and the Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup (both in 2001) for Bayern Munich in his glittering career spanning over 22 years. A highly temperamental custodian, Kahn led Germany to the World Cup final in 2002 that also won him the Fifa Golden Ball award for his performance. His biggest moment of glory, however, came in the 2001 Champions League final when he made crucial saves in the penalty shoot out to win the title  
	Ze Roberto  
	A highly gifted, quick and hard-working player, the Brazilian midfielder is in his second stint with Bayern Munich. A fantastic dribbler with a devastating left foot, Ze Roberto has represented Brazil in two World Cups (1998 and 2006) and scored Brazil's third and final goal in a Man-of-the-Match performance against Ghana in 2006. The following year, he announced his retirement from International football to concentrate on club football. The Brazilian, who once criticised the club rsquo;s style of play and predicted struggles if changes are not made, has contributed immensely to the club's success since his return to the team after getting assurances from coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.  
	Mark van Bommel  
	An immensely talented Dutch footballer, Van Bommel, who played for PSV Eindhoven, joined the Bavarians in 2006. Since joining the German side, Van Bommel has proved to be a key player for them, scoring six goals in 30 appearances, providing strength in the midfield. Due to his terrific performance during his first season at Bayern, he was voted the Bayern Player of the year for the 2006-07 season, beating long time fan-favourites Roy Makaay and Mehmet Scholl. His international career could have been much brighter but with the Netherlands failing to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, he couldn't make an appearance in a major tournament until 2006.

	Chonburi (Thailand): Gaurav Ghei turned in a one-under 71 to rise to tied 50th in the Round III of the Asian Tour International here on Saturday.         
	It was a dismal show by the Indians, with Rahil Gangjee (213), who looked prime for a top-of-the-table finish, dropping down to tied 54th after a miserable penultimate round of 75.         
	Joining him at 54th place was Digvijay Singh and Gaganjeet Bhullar.         
	Scotlands Ross Bain carded a solid five-under 67 to join Korean teenager Noh Seung-Yul (68) at the top of the pack           (PTI)

	New York: Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt set the 100m world record clocking 9.72sec at the Reebok Grand Prix athletics meeting.         
	The 21-year-old Bolt on Saturday lowered the record of 9.74sec set by compatriot Asafa Powell in Rieti Grand Prix on September last year.         
	With a favourable wind of 1.7m/sec, Bolt finished ahead of 100m and 200m world champion Tyson Gay of US (9.85) and American Darvis Patton (10.07).         
	Chinas superstar Liu Xiang did not defend his 110m title, pulling out of the race complaining of a tight hamstring.         
	In his absence, world silver medallist Terrence Trammell won in 13.11sec. Womens 100m world champion Veronica Campbell of Jamaica easily won the renewal of her rivalry with American Lauryn Williams. After a false start, Campbell powered to victory in 10.91sec, fastest in the world this year.         
	Wallace Spearmon won the 200m with a time of 20.07, second fastest of the year behind Gay.         
	Americas former world athlete of the year Sanya Richards posted a dominant 400m victory in 50.04. Jamaicas Novlene Williams was second in 50.70.         
	Kenyas Paul Koech set a US record in the mens 3,000 metres steeplechase with a solo run from four laps out, clocking 8:01.85.           (AFP)

                                                   A lovely gesture, says Hogg

      A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES
           
	Brad Hogg on Monday described Indias decision to drop charge against him as a kind and lovely gesture. 
    
	Its much appreciated by myself and the Australian cricket team. Cricket would like to move forward. Hopefully, future games between India and Australia are going to be close contests and good viewing for the spectators, with much enjoyment for the teams, said Hogg. 
    
	The following are the other reactions from India (alphabetically): 
    
	Deep Dasgupta: I am sure they reached some kind of a deal. It sounds strange to me. My only point is why create an issue if you had to agree on a deal. It sends a wrong signal to everyone. I want to read why they took it back. The country was together backing Harbhajan. 
    
	Devang Gandhi: The Indians always have a bigger heart. And they have shown it yet again. Its to forgive and forget things. Its good for the game and I think the Indian team and (Anil) Kumble have handled the situation well. Its a different issue that their charge against Harbhajan remained. Lets forget what happened for the interest of the game. 
    
	Arun Lal: A Magnificent decision. Its the way forward. Its in the interest of the game, preserving the tradition of this great game called cricket. They have shown utmost maturity in handling the issue. Why should we expect the Australians to drop charges against Harbhajan (Singh). Its not quid pro quo at all. 
    
	ASHOK MANKAD: Its good news and an indication that everything is settling down nicely. India have shown grace by closing the chapter. They can start with a clean slate. 
    
	BAPU NADKARNI: They will exonerate him (Harbhajan) too. I am positive. Otherwise Indians would not have dropped the charge against Hogg. I should compliment Ranjan Madugalle for the great job he has done. 
    
	Ajit Wadekar: It was childish, the levelling of charges and the withdrawing it so soon. It makes it clear there was no substance in the first place. The players have been made to appear foolish. I am amazed they (Indians) had not gone to the hearing with legal support to Harbhajan.

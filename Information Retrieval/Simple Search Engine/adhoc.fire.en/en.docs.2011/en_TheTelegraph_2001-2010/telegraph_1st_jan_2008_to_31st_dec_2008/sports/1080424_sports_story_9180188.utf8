The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant: Ricky not a pal when playing for India
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ishant: Ricky not a pal when playing for India
                  Ishant Sharma                     
	New Delhi: They may have become friends after sharing the same dressing room for Kolkata Knight Riders, but pace sensation Ishant Sharma on Wednesday said he would not shy away from showing aggression against Australia captain Ricky Ponting when playing in national colours.         
	Ishant and Ponting had set up a great rivalry during Indias recent tour of Australia but playing for the same team in the Indian Premier League (IPL) Twenty20 competition has provided them with a chance to become friendly.         
	It is a privilege to share the dressing room with a great player like Ponting. We discussed cricket and joked at each other at the dressing room We are just like friends now. But it is not that I wont show aggression at him while playing for India against Australia, Ishant said at a promotional here.         
	No colour comes before you when you are donning national colours. I will give it back if I am provoked and the same thing had happened in the Australia series, he added.         
	Ishant said the bad blood with the Australians in the recent Indias tour Down Under was a thing of the past and he would want to forget it and move on.         
	The bad blood during the Australian series is past. We are professionals, we are friends off the field and dont think of the past, said the 19-year-old.         
	Asked what Ponting had told him before he started bowling during Knight Riders match against Deccan Chargers, Ishant said, he (Ponting) told me the first over was very important in any game. You had done well in the past and you should be doing that now.         
	Ishant said he did not share the view of Ponting, Brett Lee and some others that the cash-rich IPL would mend the bad blood between the Indian and Australian cricketers.         
	I dont see that way. We are professionals and playing as a unit, so we have to interact, discuss cricket and other things. But once you are face to face playing for your country it is different, he said.         
	Ishant refused to pick a favourite in the IPL though he rated the Kolkata Knight Riders as very strong with a right mix of stars and youngsters.         
	It is very early to predict who would win the IPL. Moreover in Twenty20 any team which play better on that particular day wins, he said.         
	Ishant also did not agree that the shortest format of the game was heavily loaded in favour of batsman.         
	If you are a good bowler, you are a good bowler in any form of the game. A good ball bowled in the right area is a good ball whether ODI or Twenty20. So, it is not that bowlers are always whacked in Twenty20.         
	I am concentrating on bowling in the right areas. If I do that I think I will do well in the IPL, said Ishant, who had taken two wickets from six overs while conceding 16 runs.         
	On his Delhi teammate Virender Sehwags swashbuckling innings of 41-ball unbeaten 94, Ishant said it was nothing new for the Delhi DareDevil captain. Everybody knows what Sehwag can do. I have nothing to add more, he is a great player, he said.           (PTI)

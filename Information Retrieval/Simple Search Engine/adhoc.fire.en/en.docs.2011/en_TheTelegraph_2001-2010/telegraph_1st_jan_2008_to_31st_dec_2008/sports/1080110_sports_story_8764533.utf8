                                                    I can now accept failure and move on, says Baghdatis

	Calcutta: In tennis, not many players carry the hopes and aspirations of an entire nation. 
    
	Not many players have single-handedly made the game No. 2 in the sporting hierarchy of their country, encouraging the young to see it as a successful career alternative. And not many players manage to do all this and remain a thorough showman on court, delighting not just his fans but millions who happen to watch him in action. 
    
	World No. 16 Marcos Baghdatis, chewing on his cross (a lucky charm gifted to him by his brother) during a recent chat with The Telegraph, gave the impression that behind that bashful smile and cavalier attitude lies a sharp mind hungry for success, a mind that has at last come to terms with the fact that failure is as much part of life as success. 
    
	From being a fringe player since turning pro in 2003 to taking the tennis world by surprise in 2006 by reaching the Australian Open final as an unseeded player where he lost to Roger Federer, Baghdatiss journey has in many ways been a one-man show. 
    
	In Cyprus, there were hardly any tennis courts when I took up the game. I had no coach. I played with my father and brothers 
    
	And the Cypriot, who broke into the top 20 in 2006  his second full year on the ATP circuit  has changed all that. Tennis is now a very popular sport in Cyprus, next only to football. More and more youngsters are now interested in the game. There are a lot of coaching centres as well, said Baghdatis, flashing that trademark boyish smile. The kids are even following the Davis Cup these days 
    
	Baghdatis won his first career ATP title in Beijing in 2006 and followed it up with a second in Zagreb last year. He also finished within the top 20 for the second straight year. But he acknowledged that breaking into the top 10 is a different ball game. It is very difficult. I am trying to be consistent. I have to work on my consistency and overall fitness, he said. 
    
	For the Cypriot, accepting defeat has been hard. He was seeded 11th in the season-opening Grand Slam last year but was ousted in the second round by Gael Monfils. I can now accept failure and move on. After the 2006 Australian Open I put a lot of pressure on myself. I wanted to win every match. I have worked on physical strength and feel that I am stronger and tougher. 
    
	Baghdatiss New Year didnt begin too well after being shown the door in Round I of the Chennai Open by unseeded Dutchman Robin Haase but he isnt bothered about it too much. 
    
	I really played a very bad match. It was the season opener and I was rusty. In any case it wasnt a Grand Slam or the Masters, was it? 
    
	Asked to pick his most memorable encounter, Baghdatis chose the one against Andre Agassi in the 2006 US Open  a five setter that he ultimately lost 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 5-7 against the retiring American superstar. 
    
	After two sets I was really feeling bad on court. Me against not just Agassi but 25000 people. I felt so insignificant, almost like an ant! I sat down on the chair after the first two sets and egged myself on, saying no matter what happens I will give it my best shot. And what a match it was Emotionally sapping. It was a great experience, he said. 
    
	The man who idolised Patrick Rafter during his formative years and loves wearing Hugo Boss clothes, said apart from tennis, he knows nothing. 
    
	I dont have any hobbies I dont read books. I am more like a woman. 
    
	Well, he is never short of quotes!

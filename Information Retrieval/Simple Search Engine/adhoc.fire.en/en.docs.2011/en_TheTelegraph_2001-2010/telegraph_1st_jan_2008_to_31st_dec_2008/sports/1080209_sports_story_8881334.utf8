	Calcutta: Fifth seed Mansoor Zaman of Pakistan emerged champion in the Calcutta International squash meet, shocking second seed Ong Beg Hee (Malaysia) 11-8, 11-7, 4-11, 11-8 at the Calcutta Racket club Friday.         
	The win helped the world No. 35 log 487.3 points and bag prize purse of $ 4,873. This was Zamans first PSA title after coming back from an injury lay-off. The runner-up, who is world No. 18, settled for $3,300 and 330 points.         
	Zamans last title was in the Governor NWFP International (2007) where he had beaten compatriot Aamir Atlas Khan.         
	The final contest, which lasted 54 minutes, was dominated by Zaman who pushed his Malaysian opponent to the backfoot from the beginning. With his outstanding drop shots and clinical volleys, Zaman earned points convincingly.         
	Zaman beat Omar Masood of Egypt in the semi-final Thursday. Shahid Zaman of Pakistan and Jethro Binns (Wales) were Zamans victims in the quarters and pre-quarters respectively. Hee, who was the favourite, played defensively. The left-hander Pakistani capitalised on Hees weakness to wrap up the first game 11-8. Continuing from where he left the first game, Zaman nullified Hees attacks in the second game to take it 11-7.         
	A desperate Hee made some quick amends to win the third game 11-4.         
	But a resolute Zaman made a strong comeback in the fourth game. With an array of shots, and egged on by crowd support, Zaman settled the issue 11-8.

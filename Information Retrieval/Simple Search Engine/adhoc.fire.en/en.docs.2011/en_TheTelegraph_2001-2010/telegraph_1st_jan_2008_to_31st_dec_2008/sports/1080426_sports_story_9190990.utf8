                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arjun Atwal   tied 76th
                            
	Richmond: A bogey hattrick midway through his opening round marred Arjun Atwals card and his level-par 72 had him tied 76th in the $500,000 Henrico County Open on the Nationwide Tour.         
	Atwal began with a birdie and was in fact two-under when he approached the eighth, only to drop a bogey each on the next three holes.         
	Birdies on the 12th and 15th took him to one-under but again a final hole bogey came to undo the good work.         
	Atwal was the first Indian to become a member of the US PGA Tour.         
	Bubba Dickerson blasted ten-under 62 to open a three-shot lead over Roger Tambellini and Andrew Buckle who returned identical 65. (PTI)

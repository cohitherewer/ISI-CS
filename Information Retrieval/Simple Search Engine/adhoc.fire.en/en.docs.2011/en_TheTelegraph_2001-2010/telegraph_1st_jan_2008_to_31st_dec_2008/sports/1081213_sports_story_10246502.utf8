            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Graeme Swann couldnt have imagined a better start to his Test career  two wickets in his opening over. The youngster was absolutely thrilled at the end of the day.         
	My head was reeling. I could not believe I got two wickets, said the off-spinner.         
	I could not have a better start It is a great chance to play Test cricket for England. I have enjoyed every minute of my stay on the field. I was not really nervous. The first delivery went for a four and then I wrapped him.         
	I was hoping to get my first Test wicket and I achieved it. Even while batting I wanted to make an impact and was not under any pressure. I am delighted that I collected two wickets and the position we are in now means the Test could go either way. We have not given any chance to the Indians so far, Swann explained.         
	He said the team was happy with their overall performance. We are very happy. Obviously, it could have been the other way when we started the innings... To get the six wickets of the Indian top order for less than 200 is a great achievement. At the end of the day we are delighted that we have got three days to try and win the Test match.         
	Was there special planning behind Virender Sehwags wicket? There wasnt anything special planned. I was only focusing on my bowling in the right areas to take wickets.         
	What was running through his mind when bowling to Sachin soon after the double blow?         
	To be honest you do not really pay much attention to whom you are bowling. You only know Sachin is there among the batters... I would like to see him bat but not when I am playing against him. I am happy Andrew Flintoff took that great catch on his follow through.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Upbeat Bagan face United SC
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Upbeat Bagan face United SC
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Buoyed by the comprehensive 3-0 win against Peerless last Wednesday, a confident Mohun Bagan will take on United SC in their second match of the Premier Division of the Sahara Calcutta Football League on Tuesday.         
	After a cakewalk in the first match of the league, the green-and-maroon brigade will be up against a team that will feature in the next version of the I-League.         
	United, who lost two points in their first match against George Telegraph, will be boosted by the addition of the 63 Argentine striker Maxi Miliona to their squad. The footballer signed for the club on Monday. Milionas latest assignment was in the Venezuelan league.         
	Mohun Bagans Moroccan coach Karim Bencharifa admitted that the green-and-maroon brigade were in a confident mood after the win against Peerless, but said he has warned his wards against overconfidence.         
	The players are confident. But we cant afford to be complacent, as well be up against a formidable side who will take part in the I-League this season, Bencharifa said.         
	Lalawmpuiya, who scored a brace in the last match, was down with a viral fever and is a doubtful starter.         
	Lalawmpuiya is not well. Well take a final call about him before the match, the coach told the media. Branco Cardozo might start with Jose Ramirez Barreto if Lalawmpuiya fails to recover in time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL a good challenge, says Laxman
                                                   IPL a good challenge, says Laxman
                      
	Mumbai: VVS Laxman on Thursday said he wanted to get back to the Indian one-day squad but wasnt sure whether the selectors would judge his performance in the IPL to book his place in the shorter version of the game.         
	I am not sure whether the performance in the IPL will help me get back to the one-day team. It will be a good challenge playing in the IPL and want to do well for my team, Laxman said.         
	On not being chosen in the ODI squad in the recent tri-series in Australia, Laxman said it was the selectors call but would look forward playing in the one-day team given the opportunity.         
	It was the selectors call. I am happy I did reasonably well in the Tests. But given a chance Ill look forward to playing in one-dayers also, he added.         
	He agreed with Sachin Tendulkar that the Aussie team went on the defensive after the Sydney Test match.         
	I agree with what Sachin (Tendulkar) said that after the Sydney Test, they werent their normal self, not the normal game of being aggressive. You could make out that they were not aggressive as before.         
	Laxman said the upcoming home series against South Africa would be crucial and could be the beginning of Indias quest to reach the number one spot in Tests. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Adam Gilchrist jumps to   Hayden defence
                                                     Adam Gilchrist jumps to   Hayden defence
          
	Melbourne: Harbhajan Singh has said Matthew Hayden is one of the most disliked cricketers around but teammate Adam Gilchrist has called his one-day opening partner one of the most well-respected people in our team.         
	Hayden had described Harbhajan as an obnoxious little weed and challenged young Indian paceman Ishant Sharma to a boxing bout in an interview to a radio channel.         
	The Indian off-spinner refused to join a slanging match.         
	Who is Matthew Hayden? You only need to speak to international cricketers To know in what opinion they hold him, Harbhajan had said.         
	Speaking ahead of Fridays inconsequential tri-series match against Sri Lanka, Gilchrist, sprung to the defence of his teammate. Ive not ever cared to think what other teams think of Hayden. Hes one of the most well-respected people in our team, so thats all that interests me.         
	Harbhajan also alleged that Australian captain Ricky Ponting had abused him during the one-dayer in Adelaide, but Gilchrist dismissed the claims. But he admitted that the controversies during his farewell international season were taking a toll and it was important for the hosts to concentrate on playing good cricket.         
	When you start to play on emotion, thats when you dont play well, Gilchrist said. Youve got to play on skill.         
	Everyone is over it a little bit now. Im just trying to get on with the finals and play some cricket, Gilchrist said.         
	I cant speak on behalf of everyone, particularly on their team, and I havent spoken to our guys about it but Im sure everyone is just keen to let cricket get on, the Australian wicketkeeper said.         
	Theres been a lot of issues, I havent played in too many summers where Theres been any number of issues you could bring to mind.         
	He also denied an Indian manufacturers claim that his gloves could not have been different from the faulty one worn by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, saying the Match Referee has no problem with his equipment.         
	Ive had my gloves checked Ive heard a rumour I do know that the guy who makes those gloves makes my gloves as well and Ive had Match Referees check my gloves and theyre fine.         
	Gilchrist said on average his gloves were checked once every season. He said officials had cracked down on wicketkeeping gloves several years ago because they were starting to resemble baseball mitts.         
	Theyre all hand-made, hand-stitched  they may have just used a little bit too much leather in that area, Gilchrist said.         
	Its not a case of they tried to sneak back to the gloves of nine years ago that had (a) really big pouch.         
	Gilchrist felt Dhoni wearing faulty gloves was an unintentional mistake. Well, theyre illegal  the Match Referee said that. Not for a moment am I insinuating Dhoni intentionally wore them out there It could happen that easily.         
	You get your gear, were spoilt for choice, you just put it on, you train in it. I dont think they were glaringly obvious to be different to what, say, I use at the moment But they were just a bit too big, he said.

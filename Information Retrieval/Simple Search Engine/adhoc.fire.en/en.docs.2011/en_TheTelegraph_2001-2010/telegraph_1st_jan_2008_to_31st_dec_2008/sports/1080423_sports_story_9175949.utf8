    - Hockey scandal 
  -   STING OPERATION OPENS A CAN OF WORMS             OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            K. Jyothikumaran                                 
	New Delhi: Pressure seems to be building on Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill to resign after a news channel on Monday aired video clippings showing the federation secretary K. Jyothikumaran accepting bribes for including a player in the national squad.         
	While the Chennai-based IHF secretary, who resigned immediately after the fiasco, once again denied the charges, ministers, parliamentarians, hockey officials, sports administrators and former players remained unanimous in their view that Gill should also put in his papers in the interest of the game.         
	The IHF president, who was believed to be enjoying a strong support in the ministry of sports and Indian Olympic Association (IOA), found himself at the receiving end after his former college-mate and union sports minister M.S. Gill asked him to step down.         
	I believe in the totality of the situation. The IHF president must also introspect and review his position. In full consideration of the situation facing Indian hockey and the national need, I urge him to consider withdrawing from his current responsibility. It is time to let other Indians, make an attempt, to lift our hockey, M.S. Gill said in a statement.         
	The IOA, which backed the IHF till recently even when India failed to qualify for the Olympics, also changed its stance. IOA president Suresh Kalmadi on Tuesday strongly condemned the incident and called for a meeting to discuss the issue.         
	The IOA strongly condemns the alleged incident of Jyothikumaran. An emergency meeting of the executive committee of IOA has been convened at 3 pm on Monday to look into this matter and take necessary action , Kalmadi said.         
	K.P.S. Gill, when contacted, said he was out of Delhi and would only discuss things after returning to the capital.         
	We have accepted Jyothikumarans resignation, the IHF president said. When I return to Delhi, we will take stock of the situation and appoint a new secretary.         
	Lok Sabha members from all parties also condemned the incident and sought criminal proceedings against those responsible for corruption in the IHF.         
	Cutting across party lines, the MPs said the government should take strong action against corrupt sports officials.

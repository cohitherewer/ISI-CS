                                                   India keep hopes for final alive
  - TRI-SERIES 
  -  Yuvraj, Dhoni star in thrilling 2-wicket victory at the Adelaide Oval                                           Kumar Sangakkara on way to his 128 on Tuesday    
	Adelaide: India kept their hopes alive of making it to the final of the tri-series when they recovered from early jolts to script a thrilling two-wicket win against Sri Lanka on Tuesday.         
	After the islanders posted a competitive 238 for six largely built around Kumar Sangakkaras 128, the Indian batsmen overcame some anxious moments before overhauling the target with just five balls to spare in a keenly-contested encounter at the Adelaide Oval.         
	The beleaguered Yuvraj Singh marked his return to form with a 70-ball 76 while captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (50 not out), Irfan Pathan (31) and Rohit Sharma (24) were the other notable performers.         
	The victory consolidated Indias position for a place in the best-of-three finals and they need to win at least one of their remaining two matches to qualify for the summit showdown.         
	Australia lead the points table with 17 from five matches followed by India, who have 12 from as many matches. Sri Lanka are at the bottom with six points from four games and need to win two of their remaining three matches to make it to the final.         
	India next play Australia in Sydney on Sunday.         
	The Indian run chase began on a disastrous note as they lost Sachin Tendulkar (0), Gautam Gambhir (15) and Robin Uthappa (10) cheaply to be precariously placed at 35 for three at one stage before Yuvraj and Dhoni came to the rescue.         
	India needed three runs in Fervez Mahroofs last over and Dhoni completed his half century by hitting the last two runs, triggering wild celebrations in the dressing room.         
	The Indians owed their win to Yuvraj who turned around his disastrous tour with a sumptuous 76 off 70 balls (10x4, 1x6) which pulled the team out of a messy start. No less remarkable was the sixth wicket pair of Dhoni and Pathan who shared a 58-run stand and brought the Indians closer to victory.         
	The Indians still found themselves slipping when they lost three wickets and suddenly Sri Lanka were back in the match.         
	Pathan attempted a wild slog off Amarasinghe to leave India at 216 for 6 in the 46th over and then young Praveen Kumar (6) and Harbhajan Singh (3) left with India still three runs short in the 49th over.         
	Ishant Sharma blocked the last two deliveries to deny Lasith Malinga any further success. The first ball of the final over was a wide and then Dhoni steered one towards point boundary to scamper home for the required two runs.         
	It was a remarkable effort from the Team India captain who faced 68 balls en route to his half century, without hitting a single boundary.         
	Chasing 239 under lights, India were staring at defeat at 35 for 3 before Yuvraj turned things around with an almost sublime innings.         
	India lost Tendulkar in the second over and the dismissals of Uthappa and Gambhir compounded their problems.           (AGENCIES)

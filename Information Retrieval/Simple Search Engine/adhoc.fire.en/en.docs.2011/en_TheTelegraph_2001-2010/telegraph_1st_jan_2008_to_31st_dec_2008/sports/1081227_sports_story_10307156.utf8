	New Delhi: The government Friday announced a controversial new policy which allows only sportpersons with an Indian passport to represent the country in international events, a decision which came under scathing attack from the Indian Olympic Association and several tennis players.         
	The IOA and some other federations have asked the sports ministry to reconsider the decision which they described as wrong and unnecessary and said it was not in the interest of Indian sports.         
	The new policy has virtually slammed the door on foreign-based tennis players like Prakash Amritraj and Sunitha Rao as it made clear that only Indian citizens would be allowed to represent the country at international events.         
	The government has decided that, henceforth, players who are Indian citizens only can avail themselves of government assistance to represent the country, an official statement said.         
	The decision leaves the tennis quartet of Prakash Amritraj, Sunitha Rao, Shikha and Neha Uberoi  all US citizens  at the crossroads even though Shikha had Thursday said she was ready to surrender her American passport to continue playing for India.         
	The All India Tennis Association (AITA), which has been hit hard by the decision, has also asked the sports ministry to review the participation rights though it will abide by the latters decision.         
	Junior squash player Karm Kumar, who holds a British passport, recently challenged the Squash Racket Federation of Indias (SRFI) decision to restrict representation only to Indian citizens in the Delhi High Court.         
	Asked by the High Court to formulate a uniform policy on the issue, the government decided to consult national sports federations and the Indian Olympic Association before deciding to restrict representation to Indian citizens.         
	The majority opinion has emerged in favour of restricting the representation of India in international sports events to players who are citizens of India. Some federations have not offered any comment on the matter and have indicated that they would adhere to the policy laid down by the government in this regard, the statement read.

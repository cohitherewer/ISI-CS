                                                  Sachin tips for youngsters
                  Sachin Tendulkar                     
	Melbourne: Sachin Tendulkar offered tips to the younger members of the Indian team in the first outdoor session which the players managed here this evening after a long lay-off due to rain.         
	Struck by persistent rain in the last one week in Melbourne and Brisbane, which restricted them to unfinished games and indoor nets, the visitors had their first full-blown nets at the MCG .         
	No sooner than John Gloster made the players go through their stretching exercises, Sachin took Robin Uthappa and Suresh Raina aside and spoke at length about the conditions and pitches which they would come up against in the coming weeks.         
	Sachin then reserved a good part of his discourse for Rohit Sharma who seemed eager to latch on to the pearls of wisdom from the great man. Indeed Sharma made sure that he was tackling the deliveries in the desired manner by having his batting video-taped.         
	Lalchand Rajput, cricket manager of the team, said Sachin has so much of experience and he is eager to share it with the youngsters. They would benefit greatly by his advice.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni appeared to enjoy himself in bowling to Raina and later spoke at length to a few youngsters on how to play short-pitched deliveries on these surfaces.         
	The youngsters, by the looks of it, appeared relaxed and after an extensive session of nets, headed for some fielding practice.         
	Yuvraj Singh, despite his failure, too looked relaxed and eagerly participated in the nets.         
	Yuvraj and Dhoni have played important roles for India in one-dayers. Yuvraj, I am sure, would soon be displaying his best form, said Rajput.         
	Rajput was almost grateful for the first outdoor nets which his team could have at the MCG. Before nets, I spoke to the team members and wanted them to make the most of the first outdoor nets.         
	The Indians would obviously want to be in the best shape for the game on Sunday when they take on Australia in the fourth tri-series match at the MCG.           (PTI)

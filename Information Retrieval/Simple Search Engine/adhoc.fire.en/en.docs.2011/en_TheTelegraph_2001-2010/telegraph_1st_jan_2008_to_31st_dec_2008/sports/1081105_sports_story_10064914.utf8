The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - BTC takes strict measures
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BTC takes strict measures 
            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: The Bangalore-based veterinary surgeon Dr Hasneyan Mirza was in the city on Monday to help RCTC tide over the crisis emerging after the outbreak of the mysterious fever which has affected scores of horses in the Hastings and the racecourse stables.          
	Mirza, a private practitioner, may, however, face problems back home in view of todays notification by the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC), banning the entry of all professionals connected with other racing centres, including even jockeys who had ridden in Hyderabad on Monday. Mirza is also a BTC committee member.          
	In view of safety measures, BTC also barred into its premises the entry of the veterinary doctors who go out of Bangalore to attend to problems in other parts of the country. Private vets and owners are also not allowed into the BTC stables.          
	The BTC is following the Australian model of measures which proved highly effective in their time of a similar crisis. The disease being contagious by nature, spreads through humans  also termed as carriers.          
	Meanwhile, The RWITC stewards have announced that the Mumbai racing season will remain postponed till 15 January 2009. The mystery fever had hit Pune horses in mid-September. If such is the fate of Mumbai racing, it is easy to draw a conclusion about the resumption of the city races because the fever had hit RCTC stables a month later.

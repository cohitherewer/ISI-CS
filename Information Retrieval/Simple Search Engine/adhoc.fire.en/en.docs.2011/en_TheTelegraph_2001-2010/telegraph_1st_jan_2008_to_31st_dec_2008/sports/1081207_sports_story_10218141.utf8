	London: Liverpool maintained a one-point lead atop the Premier League by defeating Blackburn 3-1 Saturday as second-place Chelsea overcame Bolton with a record 11th consecutive away victory in the top flight.         
	Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso took until the 69th minute to penetrate a stubborn Blackburn defence and Yossi Benayoun added the decisive second 10 minutes later.         
	Slack defending enabled Roque Santa Cruz to pull one back for Blackburn in the 87th, but Steven Gerrard scored in stoppage time to confirm Blackburn manager Paul Inces fifth straight league loss.         
	Chelsea made light work of Bolton, with early goals from Nicolas Anelka and Deco sealing a 2-0 win.         
	Arsenal edged Wigan 1-0 thanks to Emmanuel Adebayors 16th-minute strike.         
	Hull moved up to fifth place by rallying to beat Middlesbrough 2-1 with two late goals, Jimmy Bullard gave Fulham a 1-1 draw against Manchester City, and Michael Owens double for Newcastle helped to re-establish his England credentials, though Stoke retrieved a 2-2 draw.         
	Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka took just nine minutes to remind Bolton of the talent they lost in January, leaping to head home Jose Bosingwas cross.         
	The away victory, which allowed Luiz Felipe Scolaris side to surpass the record of 10 set by Bill Nicholsons Tottenham side in 1960, was wrapped up by the 21st.         
	Salomon Kalou was denied by goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen, but Michael Ballack recovered the ball and headed down to Deco, who scored for the first time since August with a sublime scissor-kick.         
	Arsenal cruised into the lead when Wigan failed to clear a corner. Captain Cesc Fabregas fed the ball back into the area, Alex Song nudged it on to Adebayor, who drove it past goalkeeper Kirkland.         
	It could have signalled a spell of Arsenal dominance but, in a subdued atmosphere at Emirates Stadium, the Gunners didnt threaten again until just before halftime when Adebayor had a shot pushed on to the post by Kirkland.(AP)

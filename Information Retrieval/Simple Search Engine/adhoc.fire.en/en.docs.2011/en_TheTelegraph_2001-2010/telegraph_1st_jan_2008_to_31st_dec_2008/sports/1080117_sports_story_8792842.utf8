	Perth: In a departure from tradition, Australias team meeting on Sunday had a special invitee mdash; iconic former captain Mark Taylor, who is also one of the Cricket Australia (CA) directors. While he didnt go into details of what he said there, Taylor nevertheless spoke to The Telegraph on Wednesday afternoon.
 
	The following are excerpts
 
	On his presence during Sundays meeting at the Sebel Hotel
 
	(Grins) Youll appreciate I cant go into details hellip; I got a call from CAs chief executive, James Sutherland, inviting me to attend. My response was that I would do so only if Ricky (Ponting) wanted me there hellip; Ricky, for his part, said hed be happy to have me with the boys hellip; Thats when I went hellip; I suppose I got invited because Ive been an observer of the game in different roles and could give an outsiders view.
 
	On the meeting itself
 
	What Ricky said the other day, about Australian cricketers playing the game in a certain way, is what came out of that meeting hellip; Weve always played quite aggressively, we look to win hellip; Thats what professional cricketers aim to do hellip; But, yes, Australian teams could do it a little better hellip; Its not that the style has to be altered, its just about making slight changes hellip; A bit of fine-tuning to make the way we play look better.
 
	On whether that was his first presence in a team meeting after retiring in 1999
 
	Yes.
 
	On whether it was a one-off
 
	Dont know. If asked to, I wont have a problem attending another.
 
	On his thoughts on the SCG Test
 
	It was one of those Tests where a lot happened and a lot was made of what happened hellip; A lot of things did happen, for example, Andrew Symonds nicked one in the first innings and wasnt given out hellip; He went on to score an unbeaten 162. But I dont agree that Australia violated the spirit of the game hellip; Yes, we couldve played it better hellip; I accept India didnt get the rub of the green hellip; The fifty-fifty situations went against them hellip; Personally, I dont think the Australians played that badly and I didnt have a problem at all with Michael Clarkes catch of Sourav Ganguly hellip; I was happy with the captains agreement on contentious catches, of going by the fielders word hellip; Im disappointed its off.
 
	On that Clarke-catch which created such a controversy
 
	As Ive said, I didnt have a problem hellip; I was commentating and there was no replay which showed it hadnt been taken cleanly hellip; The problem is everyone began looking for controversies hellip; There arent enough people trying to do whats good for the game. If a Clarke or Ganguly claims a catch, Ill be prepared to accept it unless Im given evidence to the contrary.
 
	On Team India captain Anil Kumbles comment that only one team played the SCG Test in the proper spirit
 
	I dont think that was fair and I dont think the Indians were blameless hellip; A number of things happened which led to some ill-feeling, but the teams had more than a week to cool off hellip; Both have realised they can do things better and thats good for the game.
 
	On whether, had he been Australias captain at the SCG, would he have done anything differently
 
	Too hard to say hellip; Its easy saying things sitting in the commentary box, but its very different in the heat of battle hellip; Frankly, I cant give an answer.
 
	On whether the senior pros of both teams couldve brought tempers down instead of the International Cricket Council having to send Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle
 
	Possibly hellip; I know that Ricky was very keen to get through to Anil hellip; Cant say whether such a meeting wouldve required a facilitator hellip; What matters is that they got together and had a good chat hellip; It has resulted in a pact for good cricket hellip; Look, things happen on a cricket field and if the SCG scenario gets repeated with India bowling on the last day, then a lot of things could again happen hellip; Obviously, no team wants to lose.
 
	On whether players too should take it upon themselves to play in the proper spirit instead of everything being left to the captain
 
	Absolutely, they should hellip; Captains set the tone, though. 
 
	On India withdrawing the offensive remark-charge against Brad Hogg
 
	Its good, but I dont know what evidence they had hellip; If they felt genuinely aggrieved, they shouldve gone through the process.
 
	On whether Australia should, even at this appeals stage, withdraw the charge against Harbhajan Singh
 
	Im not sure whether it can be done, but Harbhajans case is different in that he has already been punished hellip; Like Ive said, Im not sure of the procedure hellip; Maybe the withdrawal thing could be thought of hellip;
 
	On being a role model
 
	(Grins) Im not sure whether the players actually look up to me in a particular manner hellip; What I can do is give them a feedback from the viewers perspective, the kind they wouldnt be getting.
 
	On what had been his message to the dressing room when he took over from Allan Border
 
	That we wouldnt be pussycats! Of course, theres a line which shouldnt be crossed hellip;
 
	Finally, whether commercial interests have come to influence the way cricket is played
 
	Wouldnt say so hellip; Its just that we, in the media, are scrutinising a lot more hellip; The scrutiny after the SCG Test, for example, was unbelievable hellip; Things did happen, but some were looking for controversies which werent there.

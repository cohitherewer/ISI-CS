                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sourav: If you believe you can do something, nobody can stop you
    - The former India captain speaks             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Sourav Ganguly                                       
	Chandigarh: Another day of Test cricket has passed and, so, its a day closer to the end of Sourav Gangulys career. The former India captain, who registered his 16th Test hundred on Saturday, spoke to The Telegraph late that evening.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q In terms of emotions, whats your state in the end-overs of your innings as an India cricketer?         
	A The thought that Ill be missing cricket isnt there... I prepared myself mentally before making my decision public, its not that I decided to quit on an impulse... Im ready for life after cricket... I dont regret having decided to retire.         
	Was it an easy decision?         
	It wasnt... Id be lying if I said it was an easy one... At the same time, Ive always maintained that theres more to life than cricket... Except for one series (in Sri Lanka), Ive performed all the time in the last two years, after my comeback... My hundreds and fifties have come against quality bowling attacks... Australia, South Africa, Pakistan, England...         
	Getting dropped for the Irani Trophy is what crushed you...         
	It did... If the selection committee hadnt changed, I probably wouldnt have been in Mohali...         
	Whats the legacy youll be leaving?         
	Not just me, the other four seniors  Sachin, Kumble, Rahul and Laxman  as well... I think all of us have changed the notion that Indians are poor travellers... Weve helped put together wins overseas and that, I feel, will be our lasting legacy. That Ive played a role in quite a few wins overseas is a matter of huge personal satisfaction.         
	Youve chosen not to list your grit The fighting qualities...         
	Well... What I cant understand is why people are calling this (series) another comeback... Id just been ignored for the Irani Trophy... Ive been a (Test) regular ever since my comeback at the Wanderers (December 2006)... Yes, Ive been a fighter and, even when I wasnt doing well, I didnt allow my confidence to fall.         
	What have you learnt most in the dozen-plus years as a Test cricketer?         
	(After a pause) No. 1 that if you believe you can do something, nobody can stop you... If youre lacking in belief, then no matter who is there to support you, you wont be able to do anything.         
	Have you too looked to convert the stones thrown at you into milestones?         
	At some point in your career, you will be criticised... There will be people around to make adverse comments, but its important not to lose self-belief and confidence... Obviously, youve got to be mentally tough as well.         
	One assumes youll be part of the media, specifically TV, once youre through with cricket...         
	I wont do any commentary full-time... Ive been on the road for over 12 years and need to spend time with the family... Besides, Ive got my business to look after. My commentary work, I suppose, will be limited to a big series or a major tournament.         
	Finally, today, what would be your message to emerging cricketers?         
	Be disciplined and stay focused. The rewards will follow.

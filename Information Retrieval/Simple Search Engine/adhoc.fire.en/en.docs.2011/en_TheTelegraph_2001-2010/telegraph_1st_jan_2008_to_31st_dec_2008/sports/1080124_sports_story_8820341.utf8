                                                     Lee: Blame it on Sydney umpires 

   SHARP SINGLES - Down Under
   
	Australian pace spearhead Brett Lee feels that the furore over the Sydney Test was a result of contentious umpiring and the world champions much-criticised behaviour was in no way responsible for the controversy. Lee emphasised that the nail-biting finish to the Test added to the bitterness that was also attributed to the aggressive attitude of the Australian players to win at all costs.
 
	While I dont feel we conducted ourselves poorly, the close match coupled with a few contentious umpiring decisions magnified the issue and snowballed into a crisis. Lee said. 
 
	Need a world-class spinner: Nielsen
 
	 Australian coach Tim Nielsen says developing a world class spinner should be a priority of the world champions.
 
	It is of critical importance. If you look at pitches around the world these days, spinners are crucial in deciding the outcome of games.
 
	We have been forced to use a few part-timers recently in Andrew Symonds and Michael Clarke, but its important not to lean on them too much because you want to look after them over the long haul, Nielsen was quoted as saying in The Age.
 
	With Brad Hogg and Stuart MacGill turning 37 next month, Nielsen said that rather than investing in new talent, the available bowlers should be nurtured properly.
 
	He urged administrators to keep the faith with the likes of Dan Cullen and Cullen Bailey, despite their low form that resulted in them losing their place in the South Australian XI this week. Spin bowling is not necessarily something you are going to do brilliantly at the age of 21. I think our next long-term spinner will come from the ranks we already have, rather than unearthing a new one.
 
	Gilchrists explanation
 
	 Adam Gilchrist feels that Australias cricketers were portrayed like the instigators of the Cronulla riot following the Sydney Test, and believes the fall-out from the match subconsciously affected the team during the ensuring game in Perth.
 
	No one told us to walk out there and settle down and become friendly on the field, (but) maybe subconsciously guys were a bit more aware of all the hysteria that was created, which, I think, was way over the top, Gilchrist told a radio station. Did we start the race riots that happened in Cronulla? No. We won a game of cricket. 
 
	The way we were hung out I felt like we were the ones who had started some sort of riot that had caused the deaths of people. I know its sport and its serious business (but) I really felt we were hung out to dry.

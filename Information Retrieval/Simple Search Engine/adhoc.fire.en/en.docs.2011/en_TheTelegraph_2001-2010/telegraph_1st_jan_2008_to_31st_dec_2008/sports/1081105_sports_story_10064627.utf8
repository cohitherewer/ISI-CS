The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Commissioners decision binding: ICC
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Commissioners decision binding: ICC
  - Players must always be on guard to avoid physical contact with opposition players, says Sachs       A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Code of Conduct commissioner Justice Albie Sachs on Tuesday dismissed Gautam Gambhirs appeal against the one-Test ban saying cricket is not a contact sport.         
	According to an ICC release, Gambhir will miss the final Test of the current series against Australia, starting in Nagpur from Thursday.         
	Although we have received an objection letter from the BCCI, there is nothing more that we can do as the Appeals Commissioners decision is a final and binding decision, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said.         
	The matter is now closed and the ICC will make no further comment on the case.         
	Justice Sachs, in his verdict, said: I am prepared to accept that he (Gambhir) had been the victim of prolonged and persistent verbal abuse by members of the Australian team, culminating in a moment of anger that led to his unfortunate lapse.         
	(But) cricket is not a contact sport. Small collisions can lead to big ones. Players must constantly be on guard to avoid physical contact with opposition players. The risk of accidental collision must be cut down. Deliberate collision can never be condoned, however grave the provocation.         
	Gambhir was banned for one Test by Match Referee Chris Broad last Friday after he pleaded guilty to a charge under Rule C1 of the Code (Level 2) which states that players shall at all times conduct play within the spirit of the game.         
	Justice Sachs reached his verdict after studying video footage, documentary records and written submissions, according to the statement.         
	Under the provisions of the ICC Code of Conduct, Justice Sachs had the power to increase, decrease, amend or otherwise substitute his own decision from that made at the previous hearing, and his decision is final and binding.         
	 While not without sympathy for Gautam Gambhir, I cannot find that the penalty imposed on him is so disproportionately severe that I should intervene. He concedes that what he did was unacceptable. It was not the first time. Millions of people saw it.         
	The cricketing world is entitled to expect from him and all cricketers the highest standards. The rules against actual or threatened violence against opponents must be strictly enforced. The appeal must fail. The penalty stands, Justice Sachs said.         
	Also, in line with a recent decision by the ICC board to amend the Code of Conduct, Gambhir will bear the cost of the appeal as it was not successful, the release said.         
	The incident that led to the charge being laid took place during the 51st over of Indias first innings on day one of the third Test match when there was a coming-together of the Indian opener and Shane Watson of Australia.         
	Watson was found guilty and fined 10 per cent of his match fee on Thursday for verbally engaging with Gambhir.         
	The charges were laid by on-field umpires Billy Bowden and Aleem Dar, and third umpire Suresh Shastri.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Malsawmtlunaga and Jose Ramirez Barreto celebrate a goal at the Mohun Bagan ground on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: There is more to Mohun Bagan than a Brazilian called Jose Ramirez Barreto. That is the most satisfying thing that came out of their 3-0 victory against Railway FC in the Sahara CFL Premier Division match here on Friday.         
	Nine goals in the first three matches of the season speaks volumes about a teams attacking abilities, but till Friday, it was Barreto who made Mohun Bagan look special. On Friday, the green-and-maroon brigade played well as a unit for the first time. Malsawmtluanga hogged the limelight with his hattrick.         
	Except for the first 20 minutes of the match, when Bagan were slow on the pitch, they played attractive and effective football.         
	Mohun Bagan would have scored in the third minute itself but for Lalawmpuiya, who was perhaps not ready for such an early chance. Lalkamal Bhowmicks cross from the right found Lalawmpuiya unmarked at the goalmouth. All he needed to do was head the ball in, but he headed it wide.         
	The way Mohun Bagan were playing for the first 20 minutes, nobody would have imagined that they would again pump in three goals. Everything changed after yet another wasted chance.         
	Finally, in the 38th minute, Mohun Bagan scored the opening goal. Habibur Rehman Mondal sent the ball to Barreto, standing on the edge of the penalty area, who flicked it over the head of the defender to find an unchallenged Malsawmtluanga inside the six-yard box. He had sneaked in while the Railway defence tried to set an offside trap. His touch was powerful enough to take the ball inside the goal.         
	Five minutes later, Bagan skipper Lalkamal Bhowmick sent the corner in from the left flank, which was headed down at the goalmouth by Peter Odafe. Malsawmtluanga shot the ball over the head of the custodian into the goal.         
	While the partisan crowd was demanding the third goal right from the start of the second half, Bagan players were clearly taking it easy. Bagan coach Karim Bencharifas second replacement resulted in the third goal.         
	Branco Cardozo, replacing Ishfaq Ahmed, ran all the way up to the rival defence from left and sent the ball across the goal to Malsawmtluanga, who scored the most beautiful one of his three goals, in the 81st minute. His right-footed volley off the running ball landed into the goal.

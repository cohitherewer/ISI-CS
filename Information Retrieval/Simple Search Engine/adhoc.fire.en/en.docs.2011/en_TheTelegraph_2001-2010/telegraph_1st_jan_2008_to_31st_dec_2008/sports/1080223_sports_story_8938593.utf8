	Mumbai: North Zone required just one session on Friday, the fourth day of the five-day Duleep Trophy final, to whip West Zone by six wickets and retain the inter-zonal championship for the second year running.         
	North, set to get 166 for a victory over West, started the day at 74 for three. They lost another wicket before reaching the winning total on the strength of an unbeaten knock of 94 by opener Shikhar Dhawan.         
	Dhawan, overnight 44, did all the scoring in the first hour while his partner Yashpal Singh spent an unproductive hour at the crease at the Wankhede Stadium without adding any run before getting out.         
	Dhawan, who struck 13 boundaries and a six in his 274-minute stay, with Rajat Bhatia (33 ..) put on 53 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket to help North home to a record 17th title triumph just on the stroke of lunch.         
	Ashraf Makda was the only successful bowler on Friday. He had Yashpal caught by Ajinkya Rahane after which North, who last won back-to-back titles in 1999-2000 and 2000-01, surged along to a comfortable victory.         
	Norths first innings lead of 66 runs put them in the drivers seat.         
	The champions received Rs 30 lakh while the runners-up bagged Rs 15 lakh.           (PTI)

	Beijing: Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva brought smiles back to the Birds Nest on Monday with a flamboyant, world-record breaking display of pole vaulting, after a morning dominated by Chinese disappointment.         
	Home fans had been stunned into silence and tears earlier in the day as national hero and 110 metres hurdles Olympic champion Liu Xiang hobbled off the track and out of the Games injured.         
	It was such a stark contrast to the mornings action, when the exit of Chinas most popular sportsman and main track hope cast a pall over an otherwise magnificent Games for the hosts. At the end of day 10, China, though, led with a seemingly unbeatable 39 golds, with the US way behind on 22.         
	Kenya grabbed two track golds, with a seventh successive win in the mens 3,000m steeplechase, and victory in the womens 800m through another of athletics major emerging talents, 18-year-old Pamela Jelimo.         
	Jamaicas Bolt breezed through two rounds of the 200 metres.         
	There was satisfaction too for the US team as they managed a clean sweep of the mens 400m, led by Angelo Taylor. Britain picked up another gold  their 12th  in cycling to regain third place in the medals table.         
	Games poster-boy Michael Phelps was resting on Monday and looking forward to going home to his family, friends and his dog in Baltimore after his record eight golds at one Games.

	I tried my best, says Rajput         
	 New Delhi: Former India cricket manager Lalchand Rajput is struggling to cope with the BCCIs decision not to retain his services despite the historic World Twenty20 win and the sensational tri-series triumph in Australia.         
	Obviously its disappointing to see that I have not been retained. I tried my best and the results too are also there. But I guess I cant do anything about it. I have to be positive about the whole thing, a sulking Rajput said from Mumbai.

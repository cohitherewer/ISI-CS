The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injuries bit of a concern: Dilip
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Injuries bit of a concern: Dilip
                      
	Mumbai: Expressing concern over the injuries to some Indian bowlers, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar on Friday indicated that the best available team will be picked for the forthcoming three-Test series against Sri Lanka.         
	The injuries are a bit of a concern but we have options too. All I can say about the selection (on July 8) is that we (selection committee) will pick the best possible team for the Sri Lanka series, said the former India skipper at the sidelines of a prize distribution ceremony.         
	Vengsarkar, however, professed ignorance over the injury scare to left arm pacer Zaheer Khan who, as per reports quoting National Cricket Academy physio V. Muthukumar, is still being troubled by the recurrence of the ankle injury that he had sustained in Australia last December. I know nothing about that, he said when queried on the matter.         
	According to Muthukumars report to the BCCI the Zaheers fitness can be fully ascertained only after he plays a couple of three or four-day matches. India however, have only one warm-up game scheduled before the first Test Colombo from July 23-37.         
	Zaheer had attended the fitness-specific session for some players at the NCA in Bangalore where his ankle injury was assessed by the physio. Sreesanth is also not fully fit.

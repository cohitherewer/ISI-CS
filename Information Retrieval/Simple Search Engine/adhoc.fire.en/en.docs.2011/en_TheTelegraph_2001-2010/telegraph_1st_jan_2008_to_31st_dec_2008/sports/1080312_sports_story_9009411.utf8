The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal boys add spice to SRK team
                                                   Bengal boys add spice to SRK team
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders have finalised their local recruits. The following is a brief profile of the players:         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla         
	His leadership qualities have proved to be a disaster but theres no doubting his all round abilities as a cricketer. An attacking middle-order bat and a steady medium-pacer, he will undoubtedly lend flair to the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	His international exposure may have been limited to three ODIs so far, but he will get the opportunity to mingle with some of the big names of the game. That is sure to put him in good stead in the coming years, since at 26, he still has youth in his side. He also has the experience of playing seven Twenty20 matches in the domestic circuit.         
	Sourashish Lahiri         
	He may have been hauled up by the BCCI for a suspect action but that doesnt prevent him from playing the IPL. His presence is sure to add variety and strengthen the spin attack. A decent off-spinner, the 26-year-old is also equally adept with the bat when the situation demands.         
	He hasnt got the opportunity to play international matches, though his performance in the domestic circuit has earned him berths in the Rest of India squad for the Irani Trophy and the Challenger Trophy. Like Shukla, he has also played Twenty20 in the domestic circuit.         
	Wriddhiman Saha         
	At 23, he is a promising wicketkeeper and has done justice to his reputation for Bengal this season. An useful batsman, he has a century for Bengal. Playing alongside the greats is sure to add to this Siliguri lads experience. Despite the presence of Tatenda Taibu in the side, he can benefit from the rule which allows to have only four foreigners in the playing XI. He has performed creditably in the domestic Twenty20 circuit.         
	Debabrata Das         
	One of the members of the 2006 U-19 World Cup squad, this right-handed batsman is a promising player with all round abilities. A brilliant fielder in the ring, his presence will add to the teams prowess. The 21-year-old Siliguri boy has played for Bengal in the National One-dayers this season.         
	Rohan Banerjee         
	At 19, he is believed to be a very exciting prospect in the state. Having already made his mark at the U-14 and U-19 levels, this is one big opportunity for him. The left-handed opener is consistent and never in awe of opponents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Working committee meeting on Monday
                                                   Working committee meeting on Monday
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CAB has called an emergent working committee meeting on Monday to discuss the distribution of tickets and other issues related to the IPL. The working committee will also decide the date for a special general body meeting to seek the approval of the 121 affiliated units.         
	According to the agreement, 20 per cent of the seats in each of the blocks will be allotted to the CAB while the remaining will be up for sale. The special general body meeting is likely to be a stormy affair with members opposing the rule.         
	The CAB argument is that its a private tournament and not a BCCI allotted game. So the normal practice for ticket allocations will not be followed. Then how do you compensate the members? A grant of Rs 1 lakh is peanuts. Various legal and other issues will also be raised at the SGM. The Eden lease hasnt yet been renewed and the CAB cant expect the members to remain silent, said a member.         
	If the CAB fails to get the backing of the members at the SGM, then one of the centres from among Cuttack, Ahmedabad, Gwalior and Kanpur will be given the go ahead.

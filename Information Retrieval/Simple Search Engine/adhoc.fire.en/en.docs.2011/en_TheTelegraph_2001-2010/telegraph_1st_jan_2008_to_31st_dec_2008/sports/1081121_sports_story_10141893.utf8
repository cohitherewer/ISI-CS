	A superb spell of swing bowling from 19-year old Tim Southee helped New Zealand dismiss Australia for 214 on day I of the first Test in Brisbane on Thursday, according to cricinfo.         
	Michael Clarke (98) fell short of his century by two runs as Southee picked up four for 63.         
	The Black Caps then managed to keep all their wickets intact against some fiery fast bowling from Lee and Stuart Clark for five overs, to reach seven for no loss at the end of days play.

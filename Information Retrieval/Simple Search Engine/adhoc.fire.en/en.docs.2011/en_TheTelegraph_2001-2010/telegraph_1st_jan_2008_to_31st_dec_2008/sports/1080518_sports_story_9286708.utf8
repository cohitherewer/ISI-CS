	Rome: Russian second seed Maria Sharapova pulled out of Saturdays Italian Open semi-final with Serb title holder Jelena Jankovic because of calf strain.         
	Sharapova, who would become world No. 1 next week after Belgian Justine Henin retired from tennis on Wednesday, said she should be fully fit for the French Open which kick starts on May 25.         
	The most important thing is recovery and to be ready for the French (Open), which is obviously a goal for every player, Sharapova said.         
	Im going to Paris in a couple of hours. Im going to get some treatment over there and try to be ready as soon as possible. I hope in two days Ill be able to be on court and be normal, the Australian Open champion said.         
	I wanted to play. I was ready for another challenge, another tough match, said Jankovic, who beat American seventh seed, Venus Williams in the quarterfinals on Friday.

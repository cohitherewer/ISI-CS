The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Last gasp equaliser for Bagan
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Last gasp equaliser for Bagan
    - Title race wide open as top two teams stay on equal points           A STAFF REPORTER            Mohammedan Sportings Theodore Sunday dodges past Mohun Bagans Peter Odafe (left) in the CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting let go a one goal advantage as Mohun Bagan managed an injury-time equaliser to claim a 1-1 draw and snatch a point in a Sahara CFL Premier Division return-leg match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	Theodore Sunday put the black-and-white brigade ahead, converting a penalty just before halftime, only to witness Bagan regroup in the second half and restore parity through Habibur Rehman Mondal in injury time.         
	The draw threw the CFLs title race wide open for three city giants  with Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting sharing 24 points each and East Bengal placed third with 21.         
	While Mohammedan Sporting have played 12 matches, both Bagan and arch-rivals East Bengal have a match in hand.         
	On Sunday, Bagan without Bhaichung Bhutia, P.C. Lalawmpuiya held territorial advantage in the first half and created more scoring chances, thanks to some sloppy goalkeeping by Tharangachan Tungshang.         
	While Bagans last match hero Kartick Kisku, who would like to forget his Sundays outing, missed a couple of sitters, S. Malsawmtluanga and Lalram Luaha squandered two more chances to disappoint coach Karim Bencharifas tactics on the day.         
	Similarly, Mohammedan Sporting never looked promising. With Mike Okoro operating as a withdrawn forward, Shabbir Ali pushed Jothi Kumar along with Sunday to lead his attack.         
	Contrary to expectations, the outing turned out like any other ordinary league tie till referee Dhanapati Roy pointed to the dreaded spot when a surging Sunday was brought down by N. Mohan Raj inside the Bagan box.         
	And Sundays clean finish found the hordes of Mohammedan Sporting supporters celebrating.         
	A change of strategy was immediately noticed after the lemon break. A desperate Bencharifa introduced Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto and things started looking bright for the men in green-and-maroon squad.                   
	But some reckless defensive moves by Shabbir Alis boys saw them maintaining their lead till the final minutes. They however, almost came close to add to their scoreline but some scrappy shots from Lalram Luaha put them down.         
	And to add to their woe when everything seemed over for Bagan, a brilliant Barreto headed down a Lalkamal Bhowmick free-kick from the left for Habibur Rehman Mondal for a clinical finish to rob two precious points from the opponents kitty.

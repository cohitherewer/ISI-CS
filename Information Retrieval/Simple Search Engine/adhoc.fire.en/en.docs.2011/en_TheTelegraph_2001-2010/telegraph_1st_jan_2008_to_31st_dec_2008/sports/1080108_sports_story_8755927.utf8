                                                    Real restore 7-point lead 

         Robinho celebrates Reals second goal on Sunday 
          
	Madrid: Real Madrid restored their seven-point lead at the top of the Primera Liga and maintained their 100 per cent record at the Bernabeu with a 2-0 win over Real Zaragoza Sunday. 
    
	Zaragoza completely dominated for over an hour but were frustrated by a succession of top-class saves by Real keeper Iker Casillas and some profligate finishing by their strikers. 
    
	Real made off with the points thanks to a sharp header from leading striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and a cool breakaway finish from Robinho. 
    
	With one game to go before the halfway mark in the season, Real lead the table on 44 points, seven clear of Barcelona who ground out a 2-0 win away to Real Mallorca Saturday. 
    
	Espanyol are a point behind Barcelona in third, while Atletico Madrid are two further back in fourth. 
    
	Van Nistelrooy put Real in front when he headed in at the near post after some good work by Robinho on the right. Robinho completed a classic smash-and-grab raid 11 minutes later, firing home after breaking clear down the middle of the pitch, while Casillas made several more superb saves to ensure Zaragoza were sent home empty handed. 
    
	Earlier strike partners Diego Forlan and Sergio Aguero led Atletico Madrid their first league win in 13 years at the Riazor. 
    
	Forlan broke the deadlock in what had been a tight contest when he snapped in at the far post six minutes and Aguero made it 2-0 early in the second half with a coolly-taken solo effort. 
    
	Ronald Koemans Valencia continued their dismal run of form and were jeered off the pitch by their own fans when they were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Levante. 
    
	Sevilla continued their revival and closed to within a point of seventh-placed Valencia with a 3-0 win at home to city rivals Real Betis, Primera Liga top scorer Luis Fabiano taking his tally for the season to 12 goals with a first-half double.

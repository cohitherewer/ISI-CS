	Champ Forever, who just about managed to beat Adamant Approach in his last outing over 1,400m, is strongly fancied to strike again over an extended trip and lift the 1,600m Sri Shamlal Gupta Memorial Cup, the main attraction in the Hyderabad race card on Monday. A. Imran Khan partners the K. Satheesh-trained horse.

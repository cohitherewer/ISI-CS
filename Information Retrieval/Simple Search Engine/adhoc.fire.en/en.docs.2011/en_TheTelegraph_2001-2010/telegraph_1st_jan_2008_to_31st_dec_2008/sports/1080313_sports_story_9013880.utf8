The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hamilton surfs up a winner 
                                                   Hamilton surfs up a winner 
                      
	Melbourne: Even paddling a kayak through the Melbourne surf, Lewis Hamilton had to be the winner on Wednesday.         
	The 23-year-old McLaren driver limbered up for Sundays season-opening Australian Grand Prix by beating local sporting celebrities and new Finnish teammate Heikki Kovalainen in a light-hearted race.         
	The beach event, organised by the teams sponsor, may have just been fun in the sun, but the Briton left no doubt that his compe- titive spirit was raging as fiercely as ever a year on from his astonishing debut.         
	Last year he came third, after leading for four laps and overtaking double world champion Fernando Alonso at the first corner, in his first Grand Prix. This year, he said the aim was to win.         
	That is the plan, he said. Weve been working very hard through winter, making sure the training is even better but also preparing the car.         
	I feel we have even a better opportunity this weekend than we did last year at this time. So going into the weekend I feel even more positive.         
	Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen, the Finn who beat Hamilton to the title by a single point to take the title in the final race of last year, won in Melbourne in 2007 and will again be the favourite.         
	Hamilton said his own (Silverstone) race last year had been a key moment in his career. I wasnt really nervous but everyone was expecting me to fail, he said of a debut that led to nine podium finishes in a row and four wins.         
	I started fourth and was going to come out of turn one in about eighth place if I didnt do something about it and I made a real split decision. It was right there and then, I had to make the quickest decision ever, he added.         
	I went down the outside and I managed to come out (of the first corner) in third place and I think that was one of the decisive moments in the year.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib key for Pak: Gayle
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shoaib key for Pak: Gayle
                      
	Abu Dhabi: The West Indian captain Chris Gayle on Tuesday said fit-again paceman Shoaib Akhtar will be the key factor for Pakistan in the three-match series starting here from Wednesday.         
	He (Akhtar) is always the key factor, Gayle said of the maverick Pakistan paceman, who will play his first one-dayer for over a year. He is a wicket-taking bowler in a strong Pakistan pace attack.         
	The 33-year-old Akhtar, who was out for fitness and disciplinary reasons, returned to the squad in August for a Twenty20 tournament in Canada and heads a five-man strong pace attack for the series against the West Indies.         
	Gayle hoped his team would stand up to the challenge. Besides Akhtar, they have (Umer) Gul, and backed by a strong batting line-up they are a very tough team, but if we compete well we can sneak a win in the first game, said Gayle.         
	We know it will be a tough challenge because Pakistan always play well in one-day cricket and since we have not played here and Pakistan have, they have the home advantage.

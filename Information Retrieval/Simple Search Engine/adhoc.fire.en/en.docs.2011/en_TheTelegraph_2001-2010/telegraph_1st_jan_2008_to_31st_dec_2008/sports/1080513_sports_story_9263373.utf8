                                                                                                                                                                                                     We dont want to rush Shoaib: Buchanan
  - Knight Riders coach says every match will be a test for the team from now on       A STAFF REPORTER                                      John Buchanan    
	Calcutta: John Buchanan is confident that Kolkata Knight Riders will make the semi-finals. At a pre-match news conference on Monday, the coach said every game will count from now on and it will be a test of the teams character.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Shoaib Akhtars fitness         
	Hes coming on very well His fitness will be assessed on Tuesday morning. Overall, he has made good progress. We need to see how he pulls up.         
	Chances of Shoaib playing on Tuesday         
	Even a 90 per cent fit Shoaib is good enough to take on anyone in the world. We dont want to rush him. We want to make sure he is capable of bowling the four overs well. Hes not yet 100 per cent fit, but the most important thing is hes feeling confident at the moment.         
	The team for Tuesday         
	I dont want to make any real projection on the selection. Weve retained the same XIV that went to Hyderabad but the final XI will be decided Tuesday morning.         
	The batting         
	Im pleased with the batting. Sourav (Ganguly) played a wonderful innings David Hussey also did well towards the end.         
	The opening combination         
	We would certainly like to get it going We had our sixth combination in eight matches in Hyderabad on Sunday. I think Aakash Chopra did well too. Sourav accelerated at the right time and that gave us the boost. Salman Butt has been in good touch and we hope to see the true picture of his form on Tuesday.         
	Semi-final hopes         
	Our focus definitely is on gaining a semi-final berth. Hopefully we will make it. The boys are making a great effort. From now on we are virtually playing all the top teams Each game counts. It will be a test of how our team has shaped up. The last couple of matches have gone off well. The bowling has always been very good. Were looking forward with confidence and also realise Delhi DareDevils are one of the top teams. They have good batting backed up by Glenn McGrath and Mohammed Asif.         
	Plans for Sehwag         
	Probably the same as other teams have been doing The idea is not to give him room on or around the off-stump. We have to bowl in the right areas more often before he takes the game away from us.         
	The chances against Delhi DareDevils         
	Our job is to play the best cricket against DareDevils. Weve no choice Weve got to do that and get the desired result You cant differentiate between weak and strong teams. It is important to win every match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal: Relieved to win back PGA Card 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Atwal: Relieved to win back PGA Card 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjun Atwal                           
	Chandigarh: Having scripted history late on Sunday, Arjun Atwal was preparing to head for the Chattanooga airport, to board a flight for Orlando (where hes based) on Monday, when The Telegraph got through to him on his cell phone. The Asansol-born 35-year-old spoke for around 15 minutes.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Emotions on winning the Nationwide Tour event in the US         
	Oh, Im relieved... Id been wanting to win back the PGA Tour Card and this victory has done just that... So, its relief more than anything else... Id lost the Card in 2007, after holding it for four years.         
	Becoming the first Indian passport-holder to win a pro golf event in the US         
	It means a lot and Ive shown that Indians can play golf... Actually, it feels great.         
	Significance         
	In terms of prize money, I won $90,000, which isnt much... But it has given me the ticket for the PGA Tour... Id been striving for that. (Adds laughing) I was also presented with a Rolex watch.         
	A turning point of sorts for him         
	Perhaps, yes... Its important to play on the PGA Tour... Im back there.         
	Whether members of the Indian community had been cheering him         
	Indeed, yes... There were quite a few Indians, including a family which owns a chain of hotels.         
	Winning via a sudden death play-off, which calls for a high degree of mental toughness         
	Its definitely about keeping your nerve... Regular yoga, which I learnt at the Bihar School in Munger, helps me stay tough in the mind... Ive been into yoga from the time I was a kid.         
	Dedicating the title         
	(Laughs) To Dad (Bindi)... Hed been with me the previous week when I was playing in Texas... I didnt do well and, before flying home, Dad said that I must win the next one (Chattanooga Classic) for him... For his sake, at least. So, that was at the back of my mind.         
	Not having won any tournament after regaining the Malaysian Open in March, a win which ended a five-year drought         
	One cant win week after week... Id been playing okay, but sometimes a putt here or there would make a difference. Bottomline is that one has to keep trying.         
	Next tournament         
	The Nationwide event in Miami.         
	Celebrations after winning         
	Nothing, really... Id been wanting to return home (Orlando), but missed the flight last evening... The airport is all of two hours away... Of course, Ill be heading there once Ive finished speaking to you... Therell surely be some celebration once Im with my wife (Sona, a source of much strength, particularly during the high-speed crash proceedings) and kids (Krishen, Shiva).         
	Whether he has a goal to reach before 2008 ends         
	There is something... However, Id rather not say anything till it has been achieved!         
	Message for youngsters who look up to him and the Jeev Milkha Singhs         
	Work hard and set goals... Most of the times, its a losing percentage in golf, but youve got to work towards something... Something must drive you.         
	Finally, on Team India being five wickets away from what will be a truly superb win over Australia in Mohali         
	(Laughs) Wow... Thats terrific news... Nothing pleases me more than when we beat Australia in cricket.

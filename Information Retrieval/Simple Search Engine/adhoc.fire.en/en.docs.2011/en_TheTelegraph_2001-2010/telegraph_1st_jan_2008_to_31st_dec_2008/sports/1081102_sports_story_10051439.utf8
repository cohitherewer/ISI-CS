The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies take 2-0 lead
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aussies take 2-0 lead
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A stylish century to Lisa Sthalekar and the international debut of Lauren Ebsary were the highlights of the Australias thumping 86-run win over India at the SCG on Saturday.         
	The victory gives the Australians a 2-0 lead in the five-match series after India never looked likely to overhaul the home teams total of 215/6.         
	Sthalekar (104 . off 113 balls) was again in imposing form and she scored her second one-day International century with a perfectly-timed innings that stole the initiative from India after their positive early start.         
	After being sent into bat, the hosts total was built around a 93-run fifth-wicket stand between Sthalekar and Jodie Fields. The pair were united in the 30th over with Australia toiling at 83/4 after a rain interruption.         
	Sthalekar and Fields were composed at the crease and quickly asserted their authority over the match.

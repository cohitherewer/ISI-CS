	Rome: American Serena Williams and holder Jelena Jankovic moved into the quarter finals of the Italian Open on Thursday with wins over unseeded opponents.         
	Fifth seed Serena tamed lively Italian wildcard Sara Errani 6-4, 6-3 while Serbian fourth seed Jankovic strolled past Russias Maria Kirilenko 6-1, 6-1.         
	Serena twice came back from a break down in the first set before taking Erranis serve in the final game with the help of two big smashes and a net-cord winner.         
	Italys last hope in the tournament also proved a worthy opponent in the second set, when former world number one Serena again recovered to clinch the match.         
	Jankovic played assured tennis, mixing her strokes well, but Kirilenko made some careless errors and at one stage blasted a ball into the stands in frustration.

	New Delhi: Brazilian striker Marcos Pereira is technically ineligible to play for Mohun Bagan, according to Players Status Committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF).         
	The committee, which submitted its report on Thursday, said that Pereira cannot play for the Calcutta team on loan as he was yet to sign for JCT in the new season.

	Adelaide: Team Indias positive intent invited much praise from former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram. 
    
	Speaking on Thursday evening, after stumps on Day I of the fourth and final 3 mobile Test, he told The Telegraph: Ive been very impressed by the moves made by (captain) Anil Kumble... 
    
	First, he included five bowlers in the XI, a signal that the Indians want to win, and then got Irfan Pathan to open in a horses-for-courses strategy... This positive intent is commendable. 
    
	Akram, who is here on a TV assignment, added: In fact, Ive been impressed by the moves being made from Perth, of course starting with the one to bat at the Waca after winning the toss... The Indians are definitely in a confident frame of mind. 
    
	However, he cautioned that the work was far from over. 
    
	Teams have scored over 500 in the first innings at the Adelaide Oval and still lost and, so, a really big total has to be put on the board tomorrow (Friday)... The Indians must continue to back themselves, Akram signed off. 
    
	Absolutely.

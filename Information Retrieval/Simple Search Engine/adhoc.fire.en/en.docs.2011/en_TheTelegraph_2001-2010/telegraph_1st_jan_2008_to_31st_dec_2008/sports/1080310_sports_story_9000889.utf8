	Irfan to be back on Saturday  Vadodara: The left-arm pacer Irfan Pathan is expected to reach his hometown on Saturday from Australia, his father said on Sunday.  Irfan rsquo;s father Mehboob Khan said Irfan has stayed back in Australia to look after a relative who has not been keeping well.   The BCCI official sources said permission was granted to Irfan to stay back in Australia while the entire team returned to the country after winning the CB Series Cup beating Australia.  However, sources refused to elaborate why Irfan had stayed back in Australia. But they added that ldquo;was his personal matter rdquo;.    
	 lsquo;Daredevils rsquo; campaign   New Delhi: The GMR Group, which owns the Delhi Daredevils for the upcoming Indian Premier League, will unleash a campaign on Monday featuring Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. The group, which is in the last stage of finalising main and associate sponsors, has roped in Leo Burnett for its advertising campaign and would be organising clinics and reaching out to schools as a part of the campaign.  ldquo;By Monday, we will start the actual on-ground activities of trying to connect with the fans in Delhi through a campaign, rdquo; a GMR official said.     
	Raina mentally stronger now  New Delhi: The presence of a number of talented batsmen forced Suresh Raina to be confined to the reserve bench during India rsquo;s the tour of Australia, but the left-hander says the healthy competition had made him ldquo;mentally stronger rdquo;.  The 21-year-old Raina, whom former coach Greg Chappell rated very highly, said being out of the team had helped him mature as a player. ldquo;There are lot of talented batsmen in the team. Some are waiting in the wings. It is good. It shows that Indian cricket is heading in the right direction, rdquo; Raina said on Sunday.  ldquo;It rsquo;s not a matter of competition or the slot being crowded because whoever will get the chance to perform will lap it up with both hands. There is a healthy competition in the team and it is good for the team, to be honest, rdquo; he said.    Hinds shines in Rockets win  Calcutta: A first wicket, 122-run partnership between Wavell Hinds (59) and Sachin Dholpure (54) propelled Ahmedabad Rockets to a 19-run win over Chandigarh Lions in the opening match of the third ICL tournament, the 20s Challenge, that got underway at the Tau Devi Stadium on Sunday, says A Staff Reporter. According to an ICL release, batting first, Ahmedabad Rockets notched up 158 for five in their 20 overs. In reply, the Lions quickly lost their top order. With the asking rate creeping up, it was always going to be tough for the lower-orderwhich only managed to take the score to 139 for six.

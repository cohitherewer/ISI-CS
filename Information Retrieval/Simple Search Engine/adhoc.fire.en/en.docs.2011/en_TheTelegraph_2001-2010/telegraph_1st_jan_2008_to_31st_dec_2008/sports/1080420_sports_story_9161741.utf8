            A STAFF REPORTER            VVS Laxman at the Eden on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: V.V.S. Laxman, captain of the Deccan Chargers (Hyderabad), is cautiously optimistic ahead of their opener against Kolkata Knight Riders. Despite their formidable line-up, the Team India middle-order batsman, in a news conference on Saturday, said no side could be termed as the favourites.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On Brendon McCullums innings         
	This is an exciting tournament and a great opportunity for all of us. McCullums innings is one of the best Ive seen. He single-handedly took the match away from Royal Challengers.         
	Plans to restrict McCullum         
	Weve got a plan but things dont always work your way in Twenty20 cricket. You may have a Plan I or a Plan II But you have to keep judging by the situation.         
	Working with Adam Gilchrist and Andrew Symonds and if the events Down Under have had any impact         
	Its been an amazing experience. Weve had an excellent four-five days. Theyve been interacting very well and making an extra effort to mingle with the boys. Everything about the events in Australia is now a thing of the past.         
	Playing at the Eden         
	Eden has always been special Not just because I got 281 here but also because it is one of the best grounds in the world.         
	How he is looking forward to the tournament         
	Its a challenge for me. Its about maintaining a healthy strike rate. I will adjust my game accordingly. I am a natural strokeplayer and have always concentrated on maintaining a good strike rate.         
	On leading Symonds and if he will have any problems with the crowd         
	Symonds is a known matchwinner. Im sure the crowd will love watching him. Hope he has no problems         
	If the bowling is thin on experience         
	Dont think so Though RP Singh didnt have a good Test series in Chennai and Ahmedabad, we should remember that the wickets were flat. It should also be kept in mind that the pacer was returning from an injury. Hes been bowling a lot at nets and also in practice matches. Weve a good balance of youth and experience. Theres Scott Styris and Sanjay Bangar who are good, experienced allrounders.         
	If he thinks Deccan Chargers are strong title contenders         
	All teams are strong enough         
	Leading the side         
	Its a great opportunity to lead some of the greatest matchwinners I am looking forward to the experience.         
	If the Australians have revealed the strategy of playing against Ricky Ponting and David Hussey         
	That is bound to happen They are part of the Deccan Chargers. We will exchange views on opposition players They too will share their views about their Australian colleagues.         
	If a one-sided contest is good for this form of the game         
	Yesterday the wicket was not ideal for strokeplayers. That makes McCullums contribution more special. Every game is different. There will be more contribution from other players It was because of McCullums brilliance that the game became one sided. Sometimes such things happen, in any format of the game  be it Tests, ODIs or Twenty20  due to a particular players brilliance.         
	On leading against Sourav Ganguly         
	Sourav is a great batsman and one of the outstanding captains. We have led against each other Its like a South Zone versus East Zone kind of a match

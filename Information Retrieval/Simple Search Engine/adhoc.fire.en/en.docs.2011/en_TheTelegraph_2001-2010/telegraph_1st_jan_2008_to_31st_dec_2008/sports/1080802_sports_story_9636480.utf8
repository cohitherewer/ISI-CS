                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bhajji: Its not a big turner
    - Team India dismiSsed for 329 sri Lanka reach 215/5 at stumps           A CORRESPONDENT                             
	Galle: Harbhajan Singh, who picked up four wickets on Friday, stressed on the importance of a big total and said that the team would have been happier with 100 more runs on the board.               
	Following are excerpts               
	 On how it went today         
	 We did well with the ball today (Friday), would have been nice to get another 100 on the board, but we are happy with our efforts. We bowled well, we took our catches, and we fielded well.         
	If the ball is turning a lot         
	No, its not turning that much. The odd ball is spinning. But if you bowl in the right areas and set the field accordingly, there are chances you can create.         
	What will be the plan on Day III?         
	We have to get another wicket and then the tail starts, and we know Chaminda Vaas can bat. We have to go out and give a 100 per cent, take our catches, bowl as we did today (Friday), and restrict them within another 50-60.         
	How important was the toss in this Test?         
	The toss was probably very important at the SSC. We lost the toss and it was a flat wicket. Murali and Mendis bowled really well with runs on the board. Any team will bowl well with runs on the board, anyway they are very good bowlers, and they played better cricket. This wicket is a little different, and Im happy the way I bowled today (Friday), and I hope I bowl the same tomorrow (Saturday) and in the second innings as well.         
	If India are satisfied with their performance         
	I think we are not satisfied with our efforts. Still have a long way to go. First one hour tomorrow (Saturday) will be very important, one or two wickets in the first half-hour, then we are in a very good position. Definitely we are going to go out and give our best shot tomorrow.         
	On what adjustments he made to his bowling         
	I bowled a little quicker in this match because the ball was drifting a bit. I just tried to bowl a little quick and I tried to mix my pace, and that worked for me today.         
	On the review system         
	It would have been nice to get Mahela out. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose in the review system. It would have been nice to get Mahela, a couple of chances didnt go our way.         
	His thoughts on Ajantha Mendis         
	Im not the only one. I think he is a good bowler. He has a lot of variations, and yes I was foxed. The more I play him, the more Ill know about him.         
	On Samaraweeras dismissal         
	We dont have the TV on the field. I dont know if he was out or not, but luckily we got him out.         
	Whether he is enjoying bowling at the Galle         
	I was enjoying bowling even at the SSC. You have to keep on trying when things are not going your way. I bowled a lot of overs at the SSC but here also I am just looking to bowl well.

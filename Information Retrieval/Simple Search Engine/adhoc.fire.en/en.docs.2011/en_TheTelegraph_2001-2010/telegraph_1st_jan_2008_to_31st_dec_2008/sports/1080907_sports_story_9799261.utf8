                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     RCTC takes a big hit 
            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Lightning struck at raceground on Saturday, damaging all infrastructure needed for the live and also inter-venue racing coverage. The impact of the lightning was so severe that the public address system became defunct immediately, while telephone lines, CCTV and the totalisator betting operation met with the same fate minutes later.          
	As a result of this, there was no live telecast of the the last race being run at Pune. More importantly, the RCTC had to hold back all payouts at the totalisator.          
	Both, the main and the back-up, systems have been badly damaged. Our support staff is trying to restore them. By Wednesday everything will be right; said Boman Parakh, secretary RCTC. Only Bookmakers will operate on Sunday as the totalisator also needs to set right; Parakh added.          
	Chandranath Chakravorty, manager betting operation said; It will take a day or two before the held back dividends are announced.

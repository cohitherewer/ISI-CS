The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Aguri withdraw from F1
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Super Aguri withdraw from F1
                      
	Tokyo: The struggling Super Aguri team withdrew from the Formula One world championship on Tuesday due to financial difficulties.         
	The team had been fighting for survival since last season when promised major sponsorship failed to emerge while backers Honda were not prepared to offer long-term support.         
	Super Aguri will be ceasing its racing activities as of today, team founder Aguri Suzuki told a hastily convened news conference ahead of Sundays Turkish Grand Prix. It had always been my dream to be a Formula One owner. The past two and a half years have flown past but I have no regrets.         
	A planned takeover by the Magma Group, with Dubai money, collapsed last month and Honda were lukewarm about an 11th-hour rescue bid from Germanys Weigl Group.         
	We simply ran out of time to put together a deal with Weigl, said Suzuki, who had been due to meet Hondas board in Tokyo on Tuesday to discuss the teams fate.         
	Financially it was just impossible to continue in F1 with the enormous budgets needed today. We did reach a basic agreement with Weigl but were always battling against time.         
	Super Aguris exit left Formula One with 10 teams for the first time since 2005.         
	Suzuki thanked Honda and tyre partners Bridgestone but took a parting shot at Honda F1 chief executive Nick Fry, who had expressed scepticism about Weigl.         
	I dont understand how suddenly Nick Fry needs to be commenting on everything, said Suzuki. Honda were our backers and hes not the CEO of Honda. I have no interest in Nick Fry whatsoever and have no idea what he was talking about.         
	Super Aguris trucks had already been denied access to the Istanbul circuit for the fifth round of the championship, while their cars remained at the Honda F1 factory in central England.         
	The decision to withdraw left Japanese driver Takuma Sato and Britains Anthony Davidson out in the cold.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Were a much-improved side: Gilchrist
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Were a much-improved side: Gilchrist
                  Adam Gilchrist                     
	Chennai: Hard hitting batsman Adam Gilchirst on Sunday said that his team has specific gameplan to control the onslaught of Mahinder Singh Dhoni in their next IPL League match against Chennai Super Kings, scheduled on Tuesday.         
	Talking to newspersons, the former Aussie wicketkeeper said: Dhoni is a fantastic player. He can hit anywhere he wants. We have some good bowlers to control the runs.         
	Victory in the last game has helped us gaining the tempo We would like to carry it to the next match, he said, adding As a team we have improved a lot as a team.         
	Gilchrist also pointed out that Deccan Chargers have a great blend of youth and experience, with some of the finest cricketing talents from across the globe.         
	According to him, in IPL, no team is favourite to win since in Twenty20 it much depend on the days performance rather than the team combination.         
	There are good players in every team. But all that matters is who will play well on the given day. Couple of good partnerships and some good bowling would take the team to victory.         
	About his IPL goals, Gilchrist said that the objective of everyone would be to win the title.         
	I look at the IPL this way: take the first two matches and then think of the semi final and later, the final, he said.         
	Gilchrist however, ruled out any risk for Test from the shortest format of the game. Twenty20 will no way affect Test. The longer format will still remain strong, he observed.         
	For me, the most fascinating aspect of Indian cricket is the passion the crowds have for the sport. It is no wonder that India is the second best team in the world now, Gilchrist said, while speaking about Indian cricket.

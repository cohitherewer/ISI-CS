The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inzy, Moin consider suing Shoaib
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Inzy, Moin consider suing Shoaib
  - Five years is a bit harsh but the ban is totally justified, says former batsman             Shoaib Akhtar                           
	Karachi: Beleaguered Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar could face another legal wrangle for reportedly dragging former captains Inzamam-ul Haq and Moin Khan into match-fixing scandals.         
	Shoaib apparently told a television show host that both Inzamam and Moin offered him money to under-perform in some matches, an allegation that left Inzamam livid.         
	We are waiting to see what happens. But myself and Moin are consulting and we will then decide to may be sue him, Inzamam told a Pakistani television channel on Sunday.         
	He said they would wait till the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the International Cricket Councils decision against him (Shoaib) for making those allegations.         
	Shoaib earlier claimed that he had turned down offers from bookies in South Africa and India to under-perform.         
	Inzamam gave enough indications that he was taking the allegations seriously.         
	He is trying to drag us into this match fixing issue. We will wait and see and then do something, the former batsman said.         
	Inzamam said Shoaib was making baseless allegations to save himself from the ban.         
	What can I say about Shoaib? His whole career has been full of controversies. Those who have played with him know him well. He has got into one scrap after another, he said.         
	This ban is because of his repeated bad behaviour. Yes, five years is a bit harsh but the ban is totally justified, he stated.         
	He however, expressed of having little clue why former captains like Imran Khan and Javed Miandad, who had never played with the fast bowler were supportive.         
	Imran never played with Shoaib. He (Shoaib) never played in Imrans team. So they dont know the sort of character he is. But those who know him will never support him, Inzamam stated.         
	He said it was unfortunate that Shoaib had resorted to making wild allegations after the ban.         
	I think the PCB should be supported for finally taking disciplinary action. But I think whatever he is saying has only got him into more trouble, he added.         
	The PCB, meanwhile, has dismissed reports that the ICC has sent a notice to Shoaib for not revealing about the offers made to him to under-perform. No, we have no such information as yet, a PCB official said.         
	The ICC has already confirmed that they will be talking to Shoaib.           (PTI)

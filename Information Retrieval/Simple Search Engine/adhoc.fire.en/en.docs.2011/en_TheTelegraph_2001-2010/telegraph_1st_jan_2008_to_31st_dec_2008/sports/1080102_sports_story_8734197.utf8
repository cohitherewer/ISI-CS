	Mysore: Tharun Thimmaih-trained Callidora may defy penalty and win the upper division of the Continual Trophy, the feature event in the seven-event race card here on Wednesday. Melvyn Masek partners the four-year-old filly. 
     
	The lower division of the race may witness a close contest between Millennium Force and Super Chieftan. However, the former looks much improved and he is expected to carry his topweight to another victory.

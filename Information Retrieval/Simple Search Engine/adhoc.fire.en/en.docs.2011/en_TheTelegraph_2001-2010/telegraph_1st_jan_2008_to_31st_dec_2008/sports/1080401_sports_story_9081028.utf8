The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Virender Sehwag takes a swipe at sceptics 
                                                   Virender Sehwag takes a swipe at sceptics 
  - I will try and play my natural game in ODIs, says opener         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Virender Sehwag on Monday took a dig at those who suggested that the dashing opener plundered his second triple century on a lifeless track in Chennai.         
	Sehwag, speaking during a function organised by the Delhi DareDevils to announce that actor Akshay Kumar would be their brand ambassador in the Indian Premier League (IPL), said scoring runs in international cricket is never easy.         
	Some people have been saying repeatedly that the wicket in Chennai was flat and it was easy for the batsmen to score, Sehwag said. What they missed is that Harbhajan Singh captured eight wickets in that match.         
	It is unfair to say that the first Test only produced individual records, Sehwag said with a smile. Individual performances do matter in cricket. Spectators get entertained when a batsman scores or a bowler takes a wicket. Scoring runs in international cricket is always difficult.         
	The Delhi DareDevils captain said that he was happy to silence the Doubting Thomases with his masterly 319. Lots of people raised questions about my place in the team. I am happy that I could answer them with my bat.         
	After cementing his place in the Test side, Sehwags next target is to become a permanent member of the ODIs squad. Perhaps I stay too positive when I play one-dayers, he said. That could be a mistake. Now I will try and play my natural game.         
	The Najafgarh dasher said that he was fully fit but was ignored for the ODIs. I respect the team managements decision. I have no problems with Dhoni. A section of the media floated that baseless impression.         
	Sehwag hoped to continue with the same form in IPL that he displayed in the Chennai Test. My aim is to lead from the front. We have a few superb players in the team. Well play to win the title.         
	The Team India opener said he expected the Motera pitch to be a more sporting one.         
	In Ahmedabad, bowlers, especially spinners should receive more help from the pitch. Last time we played a Test there, the match ended inside four days against Sri Lanka.         
	He denied that cricket has lost its charm and hence film stars are being roped in to boost the game. People pay money to watch entertainment programmes. What is wrong if they get to watch cricketers and film stars together?         
	Also present on the occasion were Sehwags teammates  Gautam Gambhir, Mohammed Asif and Shoaib Malik.         
	The Delhi DareDevils captain asserted his team is among the strongest in the IPL and refused to admit that the likely non-availability of the Australian and Pakistani players could deplete the side.         
	We have lots of options. If Mohammed Asif is unavailable we have Glenn McGrath. We also have local boys and other Indian youngsters, they will get the chance, which in a way is good.         
	They (cricketers from other countries) will tell us about how to dismiss (Sachin) Tendulkar, Sourav (Ganguly). We can tell them (Australians) how we planned against Ricky Ponting, Andrew Symonds, he said.         
	Bollywood star Akshay Kumar made a grand entry on the stage with a cricket bat and helmet. Akshay, the latest film star to be roped in by the cash-rich IPL after Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla and Preity Zinta, said his heart beats for Delhi as he was born in the city.

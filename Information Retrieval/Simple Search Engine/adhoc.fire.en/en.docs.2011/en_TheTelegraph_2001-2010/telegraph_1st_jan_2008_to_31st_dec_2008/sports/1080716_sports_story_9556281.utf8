            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The dispute between the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and the malis seem to be heading towards a solution after both parties met across the table.         
	It was learnt that the malis were offered a hike in daily wages (Rs 130 on a daily basis) by CAB president Prasun Mukherjee. They were also assured that their provident fund would be increased.         
	The president offered us a raise in daily wages and our provident fund. But we want a further hike and will request the CAB to do so. We will discuss the offer among ourselves and take a decision probably on Wednesday, a senior mali said on Tuesday.         
	The source said that they would be pitching for something in the region of Rs 180. We would have been happier if we were made direct employees of the CAB. But we have to do whatever they tell us We dont have much option.         
	CAB joint-secretary Samar Paul said the association was open to discussion.         
	We sympathise with them We can talk about everything including raising the wages to Rs 180, provided they understand that we cant make them permanent. Let them come to us, we are ready to sit down and discuss, Paul said.         
	Meanwhile, only one member attended the CAB Board of Trustees meeting on Tuesday. The accounts for the year 2007-08 were ratified at the meeting, Ashok Prasad Ray, the only member to attend the meeting, said.         
	The 2007-08 accounts were already ratified by the finance committee and the working committee, so I decided to ratify them. But I declined to discuss about the 2008-09 (the one related to the IPL) accounts unilaterally, Ray said.         
	Incidentally, the inaugural IPL-related expenses will feature in the 2008-09 books as the financial year starts from April 1.

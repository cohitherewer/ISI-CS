 play safe

      A STAFF REPORTER
              
	Calcutta: A win in their last ONGC I-League match against leaders Dempo on Sunday has brought back the confidence among the East Bengal players. 
    
	On the eve of their Round XIV match against Air India, East Bengal, who are lurking in the relegation zone with 11 points from 13 matches, want to play on counter attacks. 
    
	According to coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee, a win will help them escape relegation. We are in a critical position where we need to win to get out of danger. But we cannot play all out  We need to be cautious and play safe, Bhattacharjee said after practise on Tuesday. East Bengal now have five more matches left in the I-League. 
    
	With medio Jayanta Sen, forward Ashim Biswas and defender Saumik Dey sitting out through injuries, East Bengal are expected to play in a 4-5-1 format. Other than Edmilson we dont have a striker. So I will like to ensure one point first, Bhattacherjee said. 
    
	Praising Air India  who have 15 points from 13 matches  Bhattacharjee said that the young squad was capable of upsetting big teams at any point of time. A young side like them are always a threat to their opponents. If you take them lightly you may have to pay the price, he opined.

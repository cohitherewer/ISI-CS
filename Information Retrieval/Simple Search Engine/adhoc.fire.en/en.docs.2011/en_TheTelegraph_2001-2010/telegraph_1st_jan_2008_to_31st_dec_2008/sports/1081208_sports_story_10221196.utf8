            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Bengal consultant Mohinder Amarnath was happy with the teams imposing nine-wicket victory against hosts Assam in the Ranji Trophy Plate group match at the NF Railway Stadium here on Sunday but felt there was room for improvement.         
	Appreciating the efforts of the youngsters on an under-prepared wicket, the legendary cricketer said: The team is a perfect blend of experience and grit. It has the potential to do wonders in any given situation. It was a difficult track to bat on and I felt the youngsters, in particular, were good at it.         
	The boys have played a good game here, but there is room for improvement, Amarnath said.

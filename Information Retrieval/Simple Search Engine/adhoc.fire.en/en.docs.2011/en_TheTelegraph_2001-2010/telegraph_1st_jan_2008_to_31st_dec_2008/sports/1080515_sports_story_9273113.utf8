The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No compromise on Shoaib: PCB
                                                                                                                                                                                           No compromise on Shoaib: PCB
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf Wednesday made it clear that despite Shoaib Akhtars good show in the Indian Premier League, there would not be any compromise on the matter of discipline when he returns home.         
	Shoaibis playing in India after the appellate tribunal suspended his five year ban for a month and will resume regular hearing into his appeal against the ban from June 4.         
	He has to go through the entire legal process. The governing body meeting has again reiterated its zero tolerance policy with players who break rules and violate discipline. So even if Shoaib does well in the IPL it has nothing to do with his appeal hearing, Ashraf told reporters in Islamabad after the governing body meeting.         
	The board is firm there will be no compromise on discipline as a matter of policy. The appellate tribunal is an independent body which will hear Shoaibs appeal and give its decision and we have to justify the reasons for this ban on him, he said.

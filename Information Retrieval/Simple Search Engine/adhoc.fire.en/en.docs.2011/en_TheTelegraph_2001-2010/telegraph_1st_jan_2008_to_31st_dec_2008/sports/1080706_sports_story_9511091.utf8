	Dinner followed row: Sree  New Delhi: Barely a couple of hours after slapping his India teammate Sreesanth, a repentant Harbhajan Singh had a quiet dinner with the Kerala pacer to get over the unsavoury incident. Sreesanth, who was slapped by Harbhajan after an Indian Premier League (IPL) match in May, said neither he nor Harbhajan expected that it would snowball into the crisis that it eventually did. ldquo;We actually had dinner the same day. So I don rsquo;t know how come the media and people took it so seriously, rdquo; Sreesanth said in a TV interview.     
	 Tiwary move  Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary is still undecided on which team to play for during the upcoming Ranji Trophy season after Bengal were relegated to the Plate Group last season. The player, who was part of the Delhi DareDevils in the inaugural Indian Premier League, has offers from at least four Ranji teams in the Elite group. ldquo;I have at least four offers, but I can rsquo;t divulge the names. I haven rsquo;t decided yet, I will take a decision after returning from Australia, rdquo; Tiwary said. He, however, confirmed that he would play for Sporting Union in the upcoming P. Sen Trophy as his club side Mohun Bagan are not part of the meet.    
	 CA rsquo;s views  Calcutta: Cricket Australia (CA) said cash awash ventures like IPL have introduced the concept of private ownership in cricket which might prove detrimental to the game rsquo;s future, says A Staff Reporter. ldquo;We must understand and accept that the introduction of private ownership is likely to see them often at odds with the interests of international cricket. This is a real threat and is likely to provide us with many challenges in the future, rdquo; Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said.    
	 Australia fined  Dubai: Australia were on Saturday fined for maintaining a slow over-rate during their dramatic one-run victory over the West Indies in the fourth ODI in St Kitts. ICC match referee Roshan Mahanama imposed the fine after stand-in skipper Michael Clarke rsquo;s side was ruled to be one over short of their target when time allowances were taken into consideration.    
	 Surgery  Hove: Former Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed will have surgery on Monday to determine the extent of his right knee injury, Sussex announced on Friday. Mushtaq has suffered a fresh cartilage tear but has been told that he will not know the full extent of the injury until the operation has been carried out. Mushtaq underwent keyhole surgery in May.    
	 No replacement  Calcutta: No replacement will be sought for DKS in the P. Sen Trophy and Kalighat would get a walkover in case DKS don rsquo;t turn up, CAB joint secretary Samar Paul said.     
	 Jeev tied 17th  Ash (England): Jeev Milkha Singh survived a tough day carding a modest even-par 72 to slip to tied 17th spot even as Jyoti Randhawa and S.S.P. Chowrasia fell by the wayside after the second round of the European Open.

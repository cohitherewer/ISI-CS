The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wish I had Ajanthas luck, says Bhajji
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wish I had Ajanthas luck, says Bhajji
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh hoped that V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid would score some valuable runs on Monday so that the bowlers have a total to fight with. He shared his views with the media after the third days play here on Sunday.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	What is your game plan for Monday?         
	We are looking to have a good partnership in the morning. I hope Laxman and Rahul play the same sort of innings like Calcutta, and if they can do that and put us in a good position and we go on to win, it will be another great win for Indian cricket. Lets see what happens.         
	Whats wrong with the Indian middle-order?         
	Its a little disappointing that we havent performed up to what we should have as a batting unit. Its just a matter of not clicking. I dont know how it happened. But the Sri Lankans have bowled really well, especially (Ajantha) Mendis, he has been really consistent. He has been the guy who has changed the series for them.         
	According to you, what is the secret of Mendiss success?         
	I wish I could pick his wicket-taking luck. We all bowl the same sort of deliveries. Obviously he is new in international cricket and the more people play against him the more they will get to see him and people will learn about him.         
	What is the condition of the wicket?         
	Its a very good wicket to bat on. If you have patience you can score a lot of runs. Its not doing very much for the seamers and not spinning big or bouncing much.               
	Sri Lankas batting mainstay Kumar Sangakkara said on Sunday that his century in the first innings of the ongoing third Test against India was one of the more difficult hundreds to get.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Sri Lankas batting performance         
	The thinking is to keep them down tomorrow (Monday) to the lowest total possible so that we dont have much to chase in the fourth innings. Looking at our performance today (Sunday), I think Chaminda Vaas is the guy who set us up really well...         
	His hundred         
	I was very happy to get the hundred. I always say a hundred is a hundred. This was one of the more difficult hundreds to get. But at the same time, when you are a batsman, thats basically your job  every time you go out, you try and get runs.         
	The track         
	I dont think this track is going to get terribly worse than it is now. So anything in the region of 220-230 I think is chaseable.

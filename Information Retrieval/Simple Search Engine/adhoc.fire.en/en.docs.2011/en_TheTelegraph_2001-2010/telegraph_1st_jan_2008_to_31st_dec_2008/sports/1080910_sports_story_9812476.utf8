The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CA looking at life beyond Andrew Symonds
                                                                                                                                                                                             CA looking at life beyond Andrew Symonds
    - There is a lot of young talent waiting in the wings: Sutherland                   Andrew Symonds chances of making a comeback are slim                           
	Melbourne: Volatile allrounder Andrew Symonds may already have played his last match for Australia, Cricket Australia (CA) said here on Tuesday.         
	In a clear indication that CA is looking at life beyond Symonds, CA chief executive James Sutherland said the cricketer is almost lost to the team but asserted there are plenty of quality players who can fill the void.         
	It would be a great loss but, at the same time, one of the great things Australian cricket is lucky to have is exciting young talent that is knocking on the door, waiting on the fringes, Sutherland told a local radio station.         
	Symonds absence would provide a gilt-edged opportunity to players like Shane Watson, Sutherland said. People like Shane may well get the opportunity theyve yearned for so long in his absence.         
	Symonds career ran into trouble after he was sent home for preferring a fishing trip to a compulsory team meeting, an incident that gave rise to questions about his commitment to the baggy green. Symonds act had the Australian leadership group enraged and CA was not amused either.         
	On Symonds chances of never playing for Australia again, Sutherland said: I dont think thats impossible.         
	I think the message the Australian players have sent is that we want Symonds in our team, but we want Symonds absolutely committed and wanting to be there. Theyre really asking him that question, Sutherland said.         
	If he cant answer that question, it may well be that hes lost to the team, the CA CEO added.         
	On whether the IPL money was behind Symonds change in attitude, Sutherland said: Its hard to say. He only played in the IPL for two weeks.         
	Really I think there are a whole lot of factors and without Andrew sitting down and talking through some of his issues, I dont think anyone really knows the answer to how hes been affected, he added.         
	Sutherland was also happy with the way the leadership group, particularly stand-in captain Michael Clarke, handled the episode.         
	I was really proud of them the way they did it. They could have taken a short-term view of it, Sutherland said. There were obviously things going on within the team and theyre very conscious of the huge programme theyve got coming up with a very important series against India, a big summer against South Africa and an Ashes series next year.

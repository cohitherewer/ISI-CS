The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | MCC urges ICC to reverse decision
                                                                                                                                                                                                     MCC urges ICC to reverse decision
                      
	New Delhi: The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) urged the International Cricket Council (ICC) to revoke the decision of the controversial 2006 Oval Test featuring Pakistan and England where the match, which was initially awarded to the hosts, was declared as a draw.         
	The MCC world cricket committee, which met here on Sunday, observed that the ICC acted beyond its rights in overturning the decision and recommended that the match be awarded to England as was originally decided.         
	As per Law 21.10, the ICC has no power to decide that results should be altered, whether it feels them to be inappropriate or otherwise, the committee observed.         
	The ICCs decision sets a very dangerous precedent, it said.         
	Present in the two-day meeting here was former Pakistan captain Majid Khan who too put his weight behind the MCC world cricket committees decision.         
	The rule clearly states that a decision once taken cannot be overturned. I was myself present in the ICC Cricket Committee meeting held in May 2007 where it was decided that the outcome of the Oval Test should not be altered, he said.         
	However, Chairman Tony Lewis admitted the committee has no powers to ensure that the ICC acts on its recommendations.         
	Besides Lewis and Khan, the meeting was attended by Steve Waugh, Shaun Pollock, Derek Underwood, John Stephenson, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and Barry Richards.         
	The Committee also recommended to preserve the primacy of Test cricket and felt that Twenty20 cricket should not be thrust on young players.         
	The use of pink balls and day-night cricket was suggested to make Test cricket more exciting.         
	Among other decisions that were discussed included the option of taking Twenty20 cricket to the Olympics, which the Committee felt should not be carried out.           (PTI)

                                                    Tough task for Saurashtra

         Sudeep Tyagi has got 7 wickets in match so far 
          
	Vadodara: Saurashtra are banking on Shitanshu Kotak and the tailenders to prevent Uttar Pradesh from making the final of the Ranji Trophy Super League for the second time in three years. 
    
	Saurashtra bowlers had given the side an excellent opportunity by bundling UP out for 100 in the second innings and setting up a target of 162. But the batsmen squandered the advantage by throwing wickets. They finished the day needing another 69 with three wickets in hand. 
    
	Mithun Manhas helped Delhi edge ahead after the second day of the other semi-final against Baroda in Indore. A match in which no other batsman topped 50, Manhas scored a fluent 97 and was largely instrumental in Delhi managing a first innings lead of 72. 
    
	Meanwhile, Gujarat took control of the Ranji Trophy Plate Division final by coming up with a strong reply against Railways modest first innings total on the second day of the five-day match on Sunday. 
    
	After bundling out Railways for 260, Harshad Rawles 81-ball knock of 110 being the innings cornerstone, Gujarat captain Parthiv Patel and opener Nilesh Modi notched up half centuries in contrasting styles to help their team to 140 for two at close at the Brabourne Stadium.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | What you think matters, not what others think: Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                                     What you think matters, not what others think: Sourav
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL
  -   The former India captain unwinds in lead-up to last Test             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            Sourav Ganguly    
	Nagpur: Had Sourav Ganguly not found a place in the England-bound squad in the summer of 1996, after over four years in the wilderness, he wouldve quit and concentrated on the family business in Calcutta.         
	Sourav, as it turned out, was selected and went on to score a hundred on Test debut at Lords. After a superb career, Thursday will mark the start of his final India appearance.         
	In the lead-up to his last Test, Sourav (Indias most successful Test captain, by the way) spoke to The Telegraph at length.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Its expected that somebody about to play his last Test would be somewhat emotional. Youre remarkably calm...         
	A Thats because my last India appearance hasnt come on me all of a sudden... Ive been different from Anil (Kumble), who suddenly announced that the last day of the Kotla Test would also be the last of his career. My decision to quit was made known a month back, plus Id been mentally preparing myself for a month or so before that.         
	At different times, youve said that theres more to life than cricket...         
	(Interrupting) There is, absolutely... Theres a very normal side to a Sachin Tendulkar too... Even those in other walks of life who havent been fortunate to earn much and travel a lot are happy... Even for a cricketer, cricket cant be everything.         
	How would you like to end what has been an awesome career?         
	With a good performance... (Adds emotionally) That, indeed, would be a great way to go...         
	After Nagpur, youll suddenly be left with much time...         
	Unless Im required to try and get Bengal out of a corner in the Ranji Trophy, I intend taking a complete break from cricket till the 2009 IPL... I have a three-year contract with the Knight Riders and, so, will be playing the Twenty20 stuff till 2010... You know, Im really looking forward to spending time with the family... Id like to play a big part in the growing up of (daughter) Sana, who is seven now... Plus, Im quite passionate about the education project I intend starting in Salt Lake... That will be exciting... Off and on, Ill probably be a commentator on TV... So, there will be quite a few things to do... Of course, Ill be available to promote Bengal in whatever way Im asked to.         
	To cut to the present... How do you look back on your career?         
	Im satisfied... Had somebody told me that Id play over 100 Tests and over 300 ODIs and captain India in almost 50 Tests, at the start of my first-class career (1989-90), Id have shooed him away... Today, then, Ive got to feel satisfied... Id wanted to be a cricketer and have achieved success as one.         
	No regrets?         
	None.         
	Not even the time (2005-06) when you got dropped both from Tests and ODIs...         
	That wouldnt be a regret for the simple reason that I couldnt do anything about it... Getting selected wasnt in my hands... I had no control... The way sport is, nothing can be perfect... Performance counts and there will be ups and downs.         
	A lot of people, including Kiran More, tried to take credit once you made a statement-making comeback in December 2006. Did that amuse you?         
	I wouldnt like to go into that... What Ill say is that no player wants to be dropped.         
	How will you react if you bump into More tomorrow?         
	(Pauses) Wont be able to answer that...         
	What did Greg Chappell tell you in Bangalore, the day after you announced that this would be your last series?         
	He congratulated me on my career... Thats it.         
	Are you disappointed that your relationship soured after Greg became the India coach?         
	I have nothing against him... Greg, I feel, was misinformed about a lot of things... He was misled by some people... Towards the end of his (nearly two-year) stint, I think, he realised that.         
	Going back to your career, while your place as a one-day great is assured, one feels you under-achieved in Tests. That you shouldve been, say, 9,000-plus instead of 7,000-plus runs...         
	I couldve been there, yes... I dont disagree, but youve got to remember that I often batted at No.5/6 and, most of the time, we didnt really have a wicketkeeper-batsman after me... So, in a way, that definitely limited the time at my disposal.         
	What has the journey as an India cricketer taught you the most?         
	(Grins) Had I not played for so long, I wouldnt have learnt as much about life... That its never over is something I learnt the most... Also, as Ive told you, if you want to do something, nobody can stop you... That no obstacle is big enough... What you think matters, not what others think... Its important to be strong in the mind. To give my own example, coming from an over-protected family, I couldve adopted a different lifestyle once I got exposed to the world. However, I didnt and having to confront tough situations on the field made me stronger.         
	Being a role model, have you been conscious about having to behave in a particular manner?         
	Well, yes... Not that Id ever like to unnecessarily draw the publics attention to something... At the same time, I believe one should lead life the way one wants to... I guess the generation I grew up with has made me the person I am.         
	Have you noticed a change in the newer generation of cricketers?         
	They are different... They are fearless.         
	Youve been saluted as somebody with enormous mental toughness. What exactly is being tough in the mind?         
	Backing your ability in the most demanding of situations... Irrespective of how difficult the odds, youve got to trust yourself... Nowadays, theres a lot of scrutiny and one is bound to hear some of the negative comments doing the rounds... When that happens, youve got to get those comments out of your system and to keep believing you can do it... This mental toughness has to come from within and if that doesnt happen then, well, it will be difficult to survive as a pro.         
	The 2005-06 period was particularly tough on you...         
	I gave myself a 50-50 chance of making a comeback. No more.         
	Today, how do you reflect on the comeback (at the Wanderers), in December 2006?         
	My determination helped... I never lost the belief that I could still deliver in international cricket... That the team didnt do well in the tri-series in Malaysia, the Champions Trophy at home and the ODIs in South Africa helped as well... I think a lot of people knew I was a better player than the rest (available).         
	Its ironical that Dilip Vengsarkar helped in your comeback and also played a role in your decision to quit...         
	I have a lot of regard for Dilip... He had a job to do as chief selector and, hopefully, did so in the best interests of the team. I wouldnt have made a comeback if he hadnt supported me in 2006... (After a pause) You dont get everything in life, but thats the way it is.         
	Would you have thought of retirement had you still been playing ODIs?         
	No... Im hurt at the way I was dropped (January this year), that too after having a high average over the past year... I wasnt given a reason... It just wasnt fair... Players whove performed over a period of time shouldnt be dropped like a hot potato. Thats not how things should work... Communication is required... I had the confidence to do well in ODIs and Im sure I wouldve scored in that form as well.         
	Have you been thinking of your Test debut, at Lords, in 1996?         
	Cant forget the hundred I got then... That innings changed me as a batsman... Gave me so much more confidence... By the grace of God, I never lost that confidence... That way, Ive been fortunate... You need to be determined and need to be desperate too... If you dont have the want, you wont succeed.         
	To talk of captaincy... Among other things, Tiger Pataudi is remembered for making the players aware of the importance of fielding. Will you be best remembered for hardening the team, giving it much steel?         
	Perhaps, yes... Also, with great support from the senior group, getting the team to become very competitive overseas... Im happy that the youngsters I encouraged have developed into match-winners... Harbhajan (Singh) made his comeback in 2000-01, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh got their break (2000-01) when I was the captain... (Virender) Sehwag made his Test debut, in 2001-02, under my captaincy and dont forget (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni made his maiden India appearance (2004-05) when I was the captain.         
	What has gone wrong with Yuvraj?         
	Look, he has the talent and, when opportunities come, he has to give Test cricket the value it deserves... Runs dont come from talent alone.         
	Are you still disappointed that the team tripped at the last hurdle in the 2003 World Cup and you couldnt do a Kapil Dev?         
	Yes... I think that was the best team I led in ODIs... At the end of the day, though, one is judged by results and the 1983 team will be saluted as Indias finest ever... That team, after all, won the World Cup.         
	The Test series which gave you the most satisfaction?         
	The one at home, in 2000-01, against Australia... Beating them 2-1 was fantastic... The one which left me most disappointed also features Australia  in 2003-04, when we dominated but couldnt force a win in Sydney... Instead of 1-1, that series shouldve been ours.         
	One of the highpoints of your career has been sharing the dressing room with Sachin. What have you learnt from him?         
	The way he prepares for a match... Sharing space with such a great takes your own game to another level... Ive got a lot of support from him throughout my career.         
	Besides Sachin, is there another batsman youve admired?         
	Brian Lara, another great.         
	Whats the next level for Team India?         
	Being consistently good in Test cricket.         
	Lastly, could we see you as the India coach at some point in time?         
	(Laughs) If Im offered the job... I wouldnt mind, not in the immediate future, but possibly after five years or so.

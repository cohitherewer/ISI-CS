The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wife wont let me retire: Ferguson
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wife wont let me retire: Ferguson
            MARK OGDEN            Ferguson                           
	Sir Alex Ferguson dismissed the prospect of retirement, even if he adds the Champions League trophy later this month to his 10th Premier League title secured at Wigan on Sunday.         
	At 66, and with every major honour already on his CV, some observers have suggested that Red Square would be the perfect place to announce his retirement should his team deliver his second, and the clubs third, European Cup against Chelsea in Moscows Luzhniki Stadium on May 21.         
	But with a 2-0 victory over Wigan Athletic at the JJB Stadium confirming Uniteds 17th domestic title  one short of Liverpools all-time record  Ferguson insisted that he will continue at the Old Trafford helm with a team that he predicts will only improve following their latest success.         
	Ferguson said: Retire? That wife of mine just bullies me, so shed throw me out of the door at seven clock in the morning! So thats a definite no. Oh no, I dare not risk the wrath of that lass from the Gorbals. Shes quite a formidable person! I am proud to have survived for so long, but it is easier for me than the rest because I am at such a great club. How would I be without this? Please tell me.         
	This team is a good young one and has plenty of years left, so the 18th title will come. It has a lot of experience in Edwin van der Sar, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. That kind of experience allows young players to develop.         
	Having secured a 10th title in fifteen years, United go into next weeks Champions League final believing they have struck a psychological blow by securing the Premier League crown.         
	Ferguson said: Were bouncing into the Champions League final. If we had lost the title, it would have been difficult because when we lost the title at West Ham in 1995, we went into the FA Cup final and we were dead. The team was flat the next Saturday and we lost 1-0. But were not dead this time  were alive.         
	Wigan manager Steve Bruce, who was Fergusons captain in two title-winning teams, claimed that referee Steve Bennett played a key role in handing the title to his former club by failing to penalise Rio Ferdinand for handball in the first half, allowing Paul Scholes to escape a second yellow card and then awarding United a penalty.         
	Bruce said: You should ask the referee about his integrity, not ask me about the integrity of my team! Thankfully there was nothing riding on it for us, but there were three decisions in the first half that were unbelievable.

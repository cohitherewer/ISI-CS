The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Veterans flop on return to singles
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Veterans flop on return to singles
            JAYDEEP BASU            Leander Paes in action against Satoshi Iwabuchi on Sunday. Iwabuchi won 6-4, 4-6, 6-4. (AFP)                           
	New Delhi: The Indian Davis Cup squad, it seems, is still a divided lot, even after the fabulous victory over Japan .         
	On Sunday, two senior pros  Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes  had to take the court to play inconsequential reverse singles after Rohan Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj suddenly declared themselves unfit on Saturday night.         
	Taken aback by the unexpected development, the Indian team management had to fall back on the two doubles specialists to carry out the duties in the dead rubbers. The duo did oblige but were thoroughly outplayed in their respective singles matches.         
	In the days first rubber, Bhupathi, playing his first singles match in seven years, was no match for Japans teenage sensation Kei Nishikori and lost 5-7, 1-6 in only 51 minutes. Later, Paes tried to put up some resistance to Satoshi Iwabuchi but it wasnt enough to avoid a 4-6, 6-4, 4-6 defeat.         
	The results on the final day had no bearing on the outcome of the tie, which India had already pocketed on Saturday. But the question that remained unanswered was what made Bopanna and Amritraj report sick the night before.         
	While insiders said it was yet another attempt by the two youngsters to show their disapproval of Paess captaincy, the captain said both players were injured. The boys had injuries. They submitted medical (certificates). Hence they didnt play. So we decided that we would play the singles.         
	When pointed out that he had named Bopanna and Amritraj for the reverse singles on Saturday evening, Paes said: Did I say like that? I dont think so.         
	When asked how he felt about playing a singles match after so many years, Bhupathi said: I had to play. After all, what the boys did on Friday was simply amazing.         
	It wasnt a pleasant experience to watch Bhupathi play singles without any practice. In the first set, he put up a semblance of a fight but completely broke down in the second set that lasted only 19 minutes.         
	It was fun to go out there and play but in the second set I was tired and it showed, Bhupathi admitted.         
	Bopanna and Amritraj said their injuries will need a weeks break to heal. While Bopanna is recovering from a left knee inflammation, Amritraj is nursing a wrist injury.         
	My wrist felt really bad after Fridays match and by yesterday it was hurting a lot. So I had to pull out, explained Amritraj.         
	Bopanna said he would have taken a chance with his knee had India been in a crunch situation. At 2-1, I would have probably played the match but I could sit out as the tie was already sealed, he said.         
	Paes said: If I had more practice, I could have pulled it off. I needed to take my chances, especially in the third set, but lack of match practice meant I kept playing a safe game.         
	I am glad that under my captaincy we could progress to the play-off. I commend my team for their fabulous show. I have to commend Mahesh also for coming out today and completing a match, he said.         
	The two-member commission which had been appointed to look into the revolt against Paess captaincy, had a lengthy discussion with both him and Bhupathi after the tie. It has been learnt that no decision will be taken till the Beijing Olympics.

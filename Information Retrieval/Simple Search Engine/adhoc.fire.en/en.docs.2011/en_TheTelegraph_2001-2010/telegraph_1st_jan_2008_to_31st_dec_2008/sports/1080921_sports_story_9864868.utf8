            STAR RACER                          Bountiful Talent                                    
	Calcutta: Bountiful Talent was a bundle of talent on a treacherous race track, which failed to deter the Daniel David-trained less-fancied horse from winning in the afternoons main event, the 1,400m Calcutta Colts Trial Stakes.          
	A relentless downpour, minutes before the start of the first race, had left the track heavy. The start of the days programme was, therefore, delayed. Nevertheless, it was a gutsy performance that helped the horse win the race. Ridden by B. Prakash, the Vettori son was ridden off the pace to have the measure of a strongly fancied Lycia Falcon. Favourite Agios Nikolaos was never a threat. Daniel David saddled the 9-2 chance.          
	A section of riders demanded the cancellation of the days programme on the pretext that the track was unsafe for riding but stewards put their feet down after some jockeys-turned-trainers inspected the track and gave them a green signal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A very tough game awaits us
                                                                                                                                                                                                     A very tough game awaits us
                    MIND GAMES     John Buchanan                                 Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly at the   Calcutta Sports Journalists rsquo; Club rsquo;s annual   awards function on Monday. A Telegraph picture    
	It has been only 10 days since we began the competition in Bangalore but a lot of cricket, a lot of razzmatazz, a touch of controversy, some unbelievable individual innings  everything seems to have happened.         
	Yet, as we stand on the eve of the second home game for the Kolkata Knight riders, the IPL has effectively only been through some three rounds of a 14-round competition. How can teams, players, coaches, fans, owners, sponsors, broadcasters and the organisational web behind the scenes keep up with the frenetic pace and action?         
	From within the Kolkata Knight Riders team since my last article was written, we have played the Deccan Chargers at home on April 20 and then travelled to Chennai to meet the Super Kings on April 26.         
	We have completed our preparations for our game against the Mumbai Indians on Monday, after which we journey to meet the Rajasthan Royals on May 1 and then to take on Kings XI Punjab on May 3.         
	Of course, everyone seems to be talking about the controversy now. The verdict handed down to Harbhajan is close to the maximum penalty for a level 4.3 offence under the ICC Code of Conduct.         
	I think the IPL, in everything it does, has the capacity to set standards that can stamp this tournament as the model for other world tournaments and all respective countries to follow. Hence I support their stance in this matter, irrespective of the individual involved.         
	Returning to Calcutta, we have taken the opportunity to look back and identify areas that we would like to improve as an individual and as a team. The obvious area is how we can better play the first six overs as a batting group.         
	Currently teams that are winning games consistently have some power hitters at the top of the order, but also make sure that they have not sacrificed more than two wickets in the chase for runs.         
	Generally one of the top three players is batting very deep into the innings, if not all the way. A quick recap on our first game and a similar pattern emerged. The bowling department is the exact flipside of this approach; that is to create wickets in the first six overs to have the opposition on the back foot.         
	I think most people understand what to do but it boils down to how individuals execute the plan. It is about taking good decisions followed by good execution of those decisions, one ball at a time.         
	To achieve this process, one has to know ones game very well Have a clear mind and allow the game to take over in that moment of the ball being delivered being faced or being fielded, and have the courage to back oneself.         
	Experience and knowledge are very helpful allies in doing this but at the same time younger players who play without fear of failure are achieving some exceptional results as well.         
	A brief review of our recent performances shows that on a difficult Eden Gardens wicket we prevailed against the Chargers. Scoring was low which made the game tense throughout. Kartik was almost unplayable; Hafeez proved just as difficult and they received great support from Ishant and Dinda to restrict a dangerous batting line-up to 110 inside 20 overs.         
	The Knight Riders did not have it all their way as we had tumbled to 26 for three inside the Power Play. But the partnerships between Hussey and Ganguly and Hussey and Hafeez guided us home with an over to spare. Of course this was not before a power shortage stopped the game in the 17th over with the scores level on the Duckworth-Lewis system, which would have meant a bowl off had we not been able to rectify the problem in time for the match to be completed.         
	We trained well or the remainder of the week and chose the same 13 players plus Chris Gayle for the trip to Chennai. Unfortunately our top order did not give us the platform to launch a big total as they had done in our first game, again losing three wickets inside the Power Play.         
	Partnerships did not eventuate with further wickets lost in the eighth and 10th overs to leave us at 69 for five. What was pleasing was that the middle to end batsmen found a way to scramble nearly another 80 runs and bat the overs through. Laxmi Ratan Shukla was the engineer of this rearguard action and showed wonderful maturity and very good awareness of what was required.         
	I thought our defence, the combination of bowling and fielding, did a very good job to restrict the Super Kings to 95 for one from 13 overs; but from this point Hayden and Dhoni took total advantage of wickets in hand, a very good batting surface, and a small total to chase  the game was over in four more overs!         
	With three games coming up in a row, two of which are away, we have reduced the training aspect and concentrated more on the team and freshening up for what will prove to be a very tough game on Tuesday.         
	The Mumbai Indians boast of Tendulkar, Jayasuryia, Uthappa, Ronchi, Thornley, Pollock and Nehra, plus a couple of younger talents  their current results do not reflect the quality of their team.           GAMEPLAN

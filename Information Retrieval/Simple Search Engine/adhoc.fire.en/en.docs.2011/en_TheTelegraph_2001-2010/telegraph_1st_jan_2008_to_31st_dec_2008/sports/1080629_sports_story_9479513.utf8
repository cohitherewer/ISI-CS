	Calcutta: This is what the Man-of-the-Match and the Bangladesh captain had to say on Saturday:         
	Suresh Raina: I am really happy with the way I have batted in these three matches. Gautam (Gambhir) was playing very well out there and I just wanted to stay there and build a partnership with him.

I want to thank Paddy (Upton), fielding coach Robin Singh, Venkatesh Prasad and my skipper (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) for supporting me.

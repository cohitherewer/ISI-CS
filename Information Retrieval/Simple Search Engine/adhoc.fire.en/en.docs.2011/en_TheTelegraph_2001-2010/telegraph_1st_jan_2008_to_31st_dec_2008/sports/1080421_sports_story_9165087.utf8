The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My dream came true: Hussey
                                                                                                                                                                                                     My dream came true: Hussey
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: David Hussey said he would have preferred a fast bouncy wicket at the Eden. Nevertheless he was happy that Kolkata Knight Riders players showed character to pull off a thrilling victory.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The pitch         
	Not ideal for Twenty20 cricket. Wasnt the best to bat on I like to play on bouncy wickets. I cant say whether the wicket was an under-prepared one or not It could possibly be that But I am happy that we have won the match and bagged full points. In the end, we showed character. Its two out of two now Hopefully it will be three out of three.         
	The power cut         
	It was a decent break for us We recollected our thoughts and restored our plans.         
	The full-house Eden Gardens         
	Playing at the Eden was a dream come true for me But I was a bit nervous watching the huge crowd The conditions were electrifying and I enjoyed every moment out there in the centre.         
	The hot and humid atmosphere         
	Playing non stop is always tough But we are following the fitness routine of our physio, and that helps us a lot         
	Sourav Gangulys innings         
	He batted well in the middle overs. It was a captains knock and he showed character.         
	On team owner Shah Rukh Khan         
	He is a nice man A down to earth guy. He comes to the dressing room and inquires about us.         
	Was batting second a problem on this pitch?         
	Batting first is always a big advantage. Yeah it was a bit tough batting second this evening. But I am happy that we managed to win in the end.         
	Losing the toss a blessing in disguise for Knight Riders         
	The toss had a great to do with the result. But we showed great character to win in a difficult situation.

  - Popular mediaman on having missed out on the England captaincy and more         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                            
	Adelaide: Mark Nicholas, they say, is the finest captain England never had. The 50-year-old did lead England A, but missed out on playing for and captaining the England team. Nicholas, who is a popular TV presenter and commentator (besides being a leading columnist), spoke to The Telegraph on Monday afternoon.         
	The following are excerpts  
	On why he didnt get the England captaincy  
	(Laughs) I wasnt a consistent enough batsman... I did play some innings (for Hampshire) which were worthy of the selectors thoughts, but I needed to be more consistent. Also, it was an era (mid-Eighties) where the middle-order was pretty much sewn up... Mike Gatting, David Gower, Allan Lamb... I did come under consideration a few times... For example, in 1984-85, and then in 1989, my best season...   
	On whether he actually lost out to Chris Cowdrey once  
	Yes, it was in the summer of 1988... Mickey Stewart came to me during a Hampshire versus Surrey match and said, sorry, youve just lost out 2-3 for captaining in the next Test (Leeds, against the West Indies)... The reason I lost out, according to Mickey, was that I hadnt played a Test. The job went to Cowdrey... I was probably a better batsman than Cowdrey, a good friend, but he was a better fielder. (After a pause) Later, when I was among the runs in a big way, others emerged... Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe...   
	On whether it hurts that he didnt get to play for and captain England  
	Ive been asked about that a lot, but it hasnt been an issue with me... Some players do feel they shouldve played for England and the selectors erred in their judgement, but Ive been pretty sanguine about it.   
	On having captained England A more than once  
	Oh, yes... I quite enjoyed it... In fact, on the 1990 tour of Zimbabwe, they made Mike Atherton my vice-captain and said I was the best man to guide him, so to say... Its another matter that Atherton is probably the most single-minded individual Ive ever met... I guess they (the selectors) wanted him to have an alternate view of life... The tour of Sri Lanka in 1985, with the Tamil problem having broken out, was interesting... I encouraged the players to go out and see the country, mingle with the people... Wanted them to have a wider perspective... Incidentally, except for me, everybody had either already played or went on to play for England...   
	On his style of captaincy, which got rave reviews  
	I was mdash; and still am mdash; a keen student of the game... Indeed, Sir Donald Bradmans Art of Cricket was by my bedside before my tenth birthday... I studied the game, took in its history... And, when I watched matches, I watched to see captains... Their tactics, the way they handled bowlers and the way they placed fields... Ted Dexter was my first hero, but when it came to commentary, I listened to every word from Richie Benaud... Richies been my mentor and friend.  
	On having handled Gordon Greenidge and Malcolm Marshall at Hampshire  
	Gordon and Trevor Jesty were difficult to deal with... They felt they deserved the captaincy when I got the job (in 1984, succeeding Nick Pocock)... I didnt feel bitter, but couldnt understand why they wanted to upset the rhythm of the team with their distrust of me as captain... We managed to get through that... Jesty left that summer itself and Gordon had to leave after a few years because of the restrictions on overseas players... As for Malcolm, he became my closest friend and supporter. I captained Hampshire till 1995.  
	On what makes a good captain  
	The ability to back ones gut instinct... Youve got to have intuition and be a good man manager... In the beginning, when I was a lot more adventurous captain, I led by my gut instincts... Later, Id take into account the views of others... Luck too is needed... I think you need an all-round tactical appreciation and if youre a batsman, then youve got to look at bowlers differently. Understanding bowlers is a very difficult thing and you could easily misunderstand the emotions and sentimentalities... I was lucky in that I bowled a bit.... Finally, the captain has to have the respect of teammates. Im not suggesting a captain has to be aloof, but its important to stand back, off the pack, and provide perspectives which the pack may not get...  
	On his top five captains  
	Imran Khan: Its extremely difficult to unite the Pakistan team but, over two periods, Imran did that... He did it to such a degree that Pakistan became the force that their talent demanded they should be... He had that warrior-like approach and his captaincy during the 1992 World Cup was brilliant, particularly the way he handled Wasim Akram... He convinced Akram to forget his problems with the no-ball and to just bowl with all his speed and skill... Imran allowed Akram to clear his head and to focus on winning matches. Clearly, what he did for Pakistan, as a leader, was monumental.  
	Mike Brearley: Because he was such a stubborn person and didnt necessarily fit into the team pattern, (Sir) Ian Botham was tricky to handle... Yet, Brearley had the genius to make Botham important without setting him apart... He was within the unit, but still made to feel important. By doing so he could get the best out of Botham, admittedly at the best time when Botham was young and eager... The way Brearley lifted the team during the 1981 Ashes was remarkable.  
	Ian Chappell: He had that uncompromising ability... He was a master at not giving the opposition a sniff... His whole ethos was to attack... Ian believed that a counter-attack could get you back in the game when others didnt think so... He believed in playing simply and held the view that some cricketers over-complicated things. The mentality of Ians players was to always move forward... Instead of thinking what happened?, theyd ask what could happen? He was lucky to have had Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson but, boy, didnt he make good use of them!   
	Ray Illingworth: Quite like Ian... When, as a youngster, I wanted an insight into cricket, I got much of it through Illingworth. He knew the game inside out and Ive come across very few men with such an intricate knowledge. Also, he used to be a pro-active captain hellip; Hed set the agenda instead of waiting for things to happen and then responding. Like Ian, Illingworth had the ability to do what the opposition wouldve least liked him to.   
	Mark Taylor: Mark, I believe, set up modern Australian cricket... He understood the need for cricket to be played with an attacking mentality, but in exactly the right spirit. He combined the two exceptionally well and Id like to think hes the one most universally liked and respected around cricket... Allan Border came from the school which said we wont bow down and Steve Waugh from the real hard one mdash; we will mdash; and, almost at any cost, not lose... Mark stood in the middle.  
	On whether somebody narrowly missed out  
	Michael Vaughan... He was an exceptional captain from the time he took over (mid-2003) till the 2005 Ashes... He out-thought the Australians and was a genius man manager.  
	Finally, on the finest Indian captain  
	Before I answer that, Id like to say its an enormous disappointment that Sachin Tendulkar didnt make a good captain... The best of my era, I thought, was Mohammed Azharuddin whose field settings for the spinners would be exceptional... He nurtured spinners while, simultaneously, giving them attacking fields. Till all those terrible things (being sucked into the match-fixing scandal) happened, Azhar had everyones respect.... (After a pause) You need to have a bit of attitude and Sourav Ganguly definitely had that... With all the talent at the time he got the captaincy (2000), it was important that the Indians werent soft about their cricket... Sourav ensured that didnt happen... Going by what Ive heard, though, Indias best captain may have been (Mansur Ali Khan) Pataudi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sharma owes it to Sachin
                                                   Sharma owes it to Sachin
                      
	Mumbai: Middle-order batsman Rohit Sharma on Friday credited his excellent performance in Australia to Sachin Tendulkar, saying the master batsman made him feel at home during the first final of the recently concluded tri-series in Sydney.         
	As soon as I came to the crease he (Sachin) made me feel very comfortable and gave me some advice. He told me that we had to win the match. I felt no pressure at all. I thought I was batting in the nets, the 20-year-old Mumbai batsman said.         
	The youngster, who played a vital knock of 66 in the first final, said it was his childhood dream to play with the maestro whom he has idolised since he started playing.         
	I was just two when Sachin made his Test debut. I never thought that I would one day play with him and bat with him for so long.         
	I used to watch him since I started playing cricket I grew up watching his batting, he said.         
	Sharma, however, said even though he has grown up watching and idolising Sachin, he would not try and copy the style of the batting genius.         
	No one in the world can copy anyone. Everyone in the world has his own style. No one bats like Sachin, Rohit said.         
	He added that he did not allow the pressure of playing a crucial game affect his nerves.         
	I never thought that I was playing in the finals and that wasnt on my mind. While batting I dont think anything else, he said. He also expressed of feeling great to be a part of both ICC World Twenty20 meet and the tri-series triumph in Australia.         
	Its feels great to be part of the team in both of the victories.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We need a panel of coaches
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We need a panel of coaches

	I must say its quite sad the way Ric Charlesworth had to go. Its unfortunate that his expertise couldnt be used in a better way. Apart from monetary disagreement, which I know as a fact, Charlesworth must have found it very difficult to come to terms with a country so vast and culturally diverse.         
	Dont forget, the tussle between the erstwhile Indian Hockey Federation and the ad-hoc committee set up by the Indian Olympic Association had also played its part. The celebrated Australian should ideally have been around for two-three more years and helped our senior coaches in the process.         
	Towards the end of his tenure, the celebrated Australian was simply not being allowed to work. He was not allowed to come close to the squad during the India-Belgium series and wasnt consulted or even taken to Santiago. He became the victim of an ego clash with Carvalho. Carvalho, the former India coach, probably thought that in case we qualify, Charlesworth would get all the credit. He and his cronies even started ignoring the selection committee towards the end. The outcome of all these petty politicking is that Carvalho has left and we have failed to qualify for the Olympic Games.         
	 In what could have a positive effect, the ad-hoc committee has called a meeting in Delhi regarding the staging of the 2010 World Cup and has invited around 40-45 people closely associated with the game in India.         
	FIHs confirmation, that India would stage the 2010 World Cup, is huge. As hosts, we wont need to qualify. Incidentally, the name of Tayyab Akram is doing the rounds as the next consultant for Indian hockey. If the move materialises, it would only benefit Indian hockey.         
	Indias Junior Asia Cup win is a great achievement. More so when you think that we were trailing 0-2 in the final against Korea. To win 3-2 from there in regulation time is huge. However, the win shouldnt take away our focus. It is a fact that around six-seven players in the Junior Asia Cup squad had represented the India seniors in the Azlan Shah Cup. Im not saying that we had fielded over-age players, but if any allegation is made, we should be in a position to soundly refute it. Lets not forget, fielding of overage player has long been a bane of Indian hockey.         
	The IOA, meanwhile, is planning walk-in interviews for coaches. I am not sure how it would work. Whoever is selected, should at least get a 3-4 year term. In fact, I am more in favour of a panel of coaches. They can handle both the senior and junior teams. That would ensure continuity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City shock United 
                                                City shock United 
                      
	Manchester: Manchester City honoured the memory of Manchester Uniteds tragic 1958 Busby Babes before showing no regard for their arch-rivals current title ambitions with an unexpected 2-1 win at an emotional Old Trafford on Sunday.         
	After the fans of both clubs had observed a minutes silence to mark the 50th anniversary of the Munich air crash that killed 23 people including eight United players, City stunned United with an excellent performance to win at Old Trafford for the first time since 1974.         
	First-half goals from Darius Vassell and debutant Benjani Mwaruwari also gave them their first league double over United since 1969 and sent United crashing to their first home league defeat of the season.         
	Substitute Michael Carricks well-taken stoppage-time goal was no more than a consolation for the home side, who played in a 1958-style kit without logos or markings apart from the numbers on their backs as a mark of respect to the Munich victims.         
	Although the kit evoked memories of the great United side that was virtually wiped out at Munich, their performance on the day did not.         
	City, with skipper Richard Dunne outstanding in defence and Stephen Ireland and Martin Petrov battling for everything in midfield, well deserved the win that has seriously hit Uniteds hopes of retaining their title.         
	The result meant City rose from eighth to sixth in the table, at least until Liverpool played at Chelsea later.         
	Arsenal, who play Blackburn Rovers on Monday, have 60 points from 25 matches and victory will move them five points clear of United, who have 58 from 26. Chelsea, before playing Liverpool, had 54 from 25.           (REUTERS)

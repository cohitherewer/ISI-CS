The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahesh, Mark begin in style
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mahesh, Mark begin in style
                  Nikolay Davydenko after his win over Jo-Wilfred Tsonga in Shanghai on Sunday                     
	Shanghai: Novak Djokovic ended his Masters Cup jinx on Sunday, overcoming a rash of errors to beat Argentinas Juan Martin del Potro 7-5, 6-3 in the season-ending tournaments opening round-robin match.         
	Russias Nikolay Davydenko used his devastating ground game to rally past Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 6-7 (6), 6-4, 7-6 (0) in the other Gold group match.         
	In doubles action, Indias Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles of the Bahamas began their campaign with a win over Jeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie of South Africa in the Red group.         
	The Indo-Bahamas duo converted the three break points they earned on their way to a 6-2, 6-3 win.         
	Two-time Masters Cup champions Bob and Mike Bryan had a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) win over Pablo Cuevas and Luis Horna in the other Red group match.         
	The American twins are chasing a historic fourth consecutive year-end No. 1 team title (and fifth overall).         
	Djokovic failed to win a set last year in three matches, citing exhaustion from a heavy schedule in his rise to No. 3 in the world.         
	The Serb also lost in the round of 16 in his past two tournaments and said on Saturday that he was having trouble finding his rhythm.         
	I was a bit intimidated by the fact of not winning a single match last year, thats for sure, Djokovic said. But this year is different. I feel more confident, stronger player on the court, more mature.         
	I used maybe a little bit of my experience. In important moments I played my best tennis.         
	Djokovic started strongly, breaking del Potro for a 3-1 lead. Then his serve and strategy let him down when serving for the first set at 5-3. He double-faulted to give del Potro breakpoint, then weakly dumped a backhand drop-shot attempt into the net to put the match back on serve.         
	A tie-breaker loomed until del Potro netted a forehand while serving at 5-6, 30-30. The Argentine, at 20 the youngest player here, had Djokovic lunging from side to side on the next point only to see the Serb smack a forehand crosscourt winner to take the set.         
	Del Potro, who has jumped to eighth in the rankings from No. 65 on July 7, thanks largely to a 23-match winning streak, angrily spiked his racket but recovered to break Djokovic for a 2-1 edge in the second set.         
	Djokovic broke back in the next game. After del Potro held to make it 3-3, Djokovic ran off the last three games, then applauded the crowd for its support.         
	I have the best fans here in China, he said, adding Thank you in Chinese to a huge roar.         
	Del Potro, who has been nursing a sore toe since the US Open, was left to lament what might have been.         
	When you play against (Rafael) Nadal, (Roger) Federer or Djokovic, you have just one chance or two. I had a breakpoint. I didnt get it. (AP)

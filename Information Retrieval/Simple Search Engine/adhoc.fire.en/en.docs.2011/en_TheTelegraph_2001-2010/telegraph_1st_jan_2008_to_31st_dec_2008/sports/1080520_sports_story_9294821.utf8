	Greensville: A bogey-bogey finish denied Arjun Atwal a place among the top five even though his final round of one-under 71 was enough to get him to tied eighth place in the BMW Charity Pro-Am meet.         
	The Orlando-based golfer finished with a four-day total of 11-under 275 and his exploits also helped him move up to 14th place on the Nationwide Tours money leaders list. At the end of the season, the top 25 will get a PGA Tour card for next season.         
	David Mathis brought in a 68 to complete a wire-to-wire triumph at 20-under 266. (PTI)

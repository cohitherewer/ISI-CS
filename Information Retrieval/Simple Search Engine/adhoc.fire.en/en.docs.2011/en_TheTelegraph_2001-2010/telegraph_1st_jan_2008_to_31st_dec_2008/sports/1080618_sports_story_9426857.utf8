                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bhupathi, Paes move into quarter finals 
                      Bhupathi and Paes                       
	New Delhi: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi appeared to have begun from where they left, launching their Olympic preparations with an emphatic straight set win in the mens doubles event opener at the Euro 349,000 Ordina Open in Shertogenbosch, the Netherlands on Tuesday.         
	The second-seeded Indian pair defeated Swiss Yves Allegro and Sebastian Prieto of Argentina 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) to advance to the quarter finals of the tournament, a warm-up for the Wimbledon Championships.         
	Paes and Bhupathi began well and soon discovered the old touch as after first six games on serve, the Indian Express pounced on the first available opportunity to break their opponents to go up.         
	They converted first of the two breakpoints in the sixth game and then next three games went with serves, giving the Indians 1-0 lead in just 28 minutes.         
	In the second set, Paes and Bhupathi had chances at regular intervals  third, fifth and ninth games  to break but Allegro and Prieto warded off the threat with some sensible tennis.         
	Ultimately, the tie-breaker came in to break the deadlock and the Indians prevailed over to advance to the next round, where they face Spaniards David Ferrer and Marcel Granollers.         
	Rohan Bopanna, with his American partner Robert Lindstedt, bit the dust in their opening round match.         
	Bopanna and Lindstedt were made to swallow a crushing 2-6, 1-6 loss by Argentine pair of Guillermo Canas and Juan Martin Del Porto in just 41 minutes.         
	The fourth seed Indo-Swede duo of Bopanna and Lindstedt were broken in the very first game of the match and could get on board only in the fifth. But by then, a healthy 4-1 lead had put their opponents in the drivers seat.         
	It was the same story in the second set as Bopanna and Lindstedt won their first game after dropping serves in the first and third. They again dropped the seventh to crash out of the tournament.         
	Bopanna had carved out an impressive first round win in the singles event on Monday after defeating Martin Verker of the Netherlands. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gagan pulls it off once again
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gagan pulls it off once again
                  Gagan Narang                     
	New Delhi: Gagan Narang has finally been able to leave behind the disappointment of the Beijing Olympics, after shooting the perfect score for the third time in less than six months as he again hit 400 at the German shooting league  Bundesliga.         
	Gagan, who had missed a final berth by a whisker in the Olympics this August, scored 400/400 against Jamie Beyerele of the US, who shot 397 in the air rifle event. He had shot down the world record of 600/600 in July in Germany and a perfect 400 late last month at the Bundesliga.         
	Shooting perfect is always a high because we always strive for perfection. Gagan said. The league has a 40-shot format for both men and women.         
	Gagan had earlier shot a perfect score of 400 against Karin Prediger of the Petersaurach club. It is tough to beat a shooter like Gagan who shoots perfect scores, Jamie said.         
	With this win, Gagans team Affalterbach beat Germania Prittlebach 4-1 to enter the knockout stage of the league. (PTI)

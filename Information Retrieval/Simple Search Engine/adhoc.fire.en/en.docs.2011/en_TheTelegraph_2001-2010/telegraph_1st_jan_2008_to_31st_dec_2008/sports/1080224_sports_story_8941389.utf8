The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Double blow to Arsenal
                                                   Double blow to Arsenal
                      
	London: Premier League leaders Arsenal suffered a double blow at Birmingham City on Saturday when they were held to a 2-2 draw and lost striker Eduardo da Silva to a terrible leg injury.         
	James McFadden equalised for Birmingham with a penalty five minutes into stoppage time after Theo Walcotts first league goals for Arsenal early in the second half had put his team 2-1 ahead and on course for an eight-point lead in the title race.         
	The match was overshadowed by the third-minute tackle by Martin Taylor that left Eduardo with a broken left leg. The Brazilian-born Croatia international needed eight minutes of treatment before being taken to hospital.         
	Taylor was shown a straight red card for the tackle.         
	Ten-man Birmingham took the lead after 28 minutes when McFadden was fouled on the edge of the box by Mathieu Flamini and the Scotland striker curled in a glorious free kick.         
	 The tackle was horrendous and this guy (Taylor) should never play football again, a furious Arsene Wenger told BBC television.           (REUTERS)

                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bekele wins 5000m
                  Kenenisa Bekele in Beijing on Saturday                     
	Beijing: Kenenisa Bekele became the first man to complete the Olympic long-distance double for 28 years when he romped to the 5,000 metres title on the final evening of athletics competition at the Birds Nest on Saturday.         
	There was more east African success on the track when Kenyan Wilfred Bungei took gold in the mens 800 metres and compatriot Nancy Jebet Langat claimed the womens 1,500m.         
	Norways Andreas Thorkildsen retained his javelin crown but there was a shock in the high jump as Blanka Vlasic, unbeaten all season, lost out to Belgiums Tia Hellebaut.         
	The US, who suffered double disaster in the sprint relay heats, roared back in the 4x400 with a thrilling win in the womens race and dominant victory in the mens, the traditional finale of the last night session.         
	Bekele, who retained his 10,000 title on Sunday, wanted to go one better than his silver of four years ago and, as world record holder, started hot favourite to emulate the double of his compatriot Tirunesh Dibaba in the womens long-distance events.         
	The race followed a predictable pattern as Bekele was given a ride by brother Tariku and the third Ethiopian, Abreham Cherkos.         
	The rest of the field, bar the Kenyans, dropped back before Bekele took off at the bell to win comfortably.         
	His time of 12 minutes 57.82 seconds was an Olympic record and made him the first man to do the double since compatriot Miruts Yifter.         
	There were two more medals for Kenya as Eliud Kipchoge took silver and Edwin Cheruiyot Soi the bronze.         
	Bungei finally claimed the major title his talent has promised for years when he delivered a dominant display in the 800.         
	The race was there for the taking after several leading contenders failed to get past the semi-finals and the 28-year-old Kenyan, still the fifth-fastest man ever to run two laps, drove home from the bell to win in 1:44.65 seconds.         
	Ismail Ahmed Ismail of Sudan took silver with another Kenyan, world champion Alfred Kirwa Yego, finishing strongly for bronze.         
	When I look back at where I was in 2001 I never expected to be still running but Im happy I continued, said Bungei.         
	Langats win was much more of a surprise as world champion and favourite Maryam Yusuf Jamal of Bahrain led through the bell.         
	However, sickness sapped her strength and Langat tore past with 250 to go and won easily in 4:00.23. Ukraine took both minor medals through Iryna Lishchynska and Nataliya Tobias.         
	Vlasic, unbeaten in any competition since June 2007, was short odds to add Olympic gold to her world title but she needed two attempts to clear 2.05 metres which Hellebaut cleared first time to win on countback after both failed at 2.07. Thorkildsen threw an Olympic record 90.57 metres with his fifth effort to beat Latvias Ainars Kovals and world champion Tero Pitkamaki.

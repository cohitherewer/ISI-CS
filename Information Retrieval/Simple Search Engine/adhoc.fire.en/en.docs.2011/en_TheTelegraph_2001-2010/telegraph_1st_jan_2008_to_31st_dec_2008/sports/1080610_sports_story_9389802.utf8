The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India hope to halt Pak run
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India hope to halt Pak run
  - TRI-SERIES 
  -   Rain could play spoilsport in Dhaka today                                     
	Dhaka: With the euphoria of Indian Premier League (IPL) all but settled, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his team will have to quickly get back into the one-day mode to snap Pakistans 12-match winning streak when the traditional rivals face off in the cricket tri-series here on Tuesday.         
	Pakistan routed Bangladesh by 70 runs in the tri-series opener on Sunday to extend their unbeaten streak to 12 matches and it would be a tough task for Dhonis young Indian side to halt the arch-rivals.         
	With seniors like Sachin Tendulkar, recovering from a groin injury, and Harbhajan Singh, serving a ban for slapping Sreesanth during the IPL, not in the ranks, it would be anything but easy for Dhonis young brigade against Pakistan.         
	The team had a feel of the ground and the conditions on Sunday and put in three hours at the indoor nets after rain prevented any outdoor practice session.         
	The short tri-series, being seen as a warm-up for the Asia Cup late this month in Pakistan, is crucial for the Indians as it provides an opportunity for players like allrounder Yusuf Pathan, spinner Piyush Chawla and Gony to show their worth in absence of the seniors.         
	With the pitch at the Sher-e Bangla stadium likely to assist the batsmen, Indias new-look bowling attack, to be spearheaded by Irfan Pathan and Ishant Sharma, will be severely tested.         
	No doubt, the Indian team has the batting strength to score heavily on a strip like this but it remains to be seen how their bowlers contain hard-hitters like Salman Butt, Kamran Akmal, Misbah-ul Haq, Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf.         
	The much-anticipated contest meanwhile faces a major threat from the weather gods. The opener itself was truncated because of intermittent drizzle and this match too could see rain interruptions.         
	As for the Pakistani attack, medium pacers, particularly young talent Wahab Riaz, were impressive in Sundays win over Bangladesh.         
	But with Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif missing from the attack, it remains to be seen how Sohail Tanvir and his bowling colleagues fare against Indias star-studded line-up.

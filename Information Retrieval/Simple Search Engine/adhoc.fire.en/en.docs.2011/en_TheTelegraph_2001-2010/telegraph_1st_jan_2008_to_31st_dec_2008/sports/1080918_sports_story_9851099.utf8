  - Come-from-behind win for Reds 
  -   Easy for Chelsea, Barcelona               Cluj goalkeeper Eduard Stancioiu (left) punches away a header from AS Roma forward Mirko Vucinic during the Champions League group A match on Tuesday                           
	Brussels: Champions League debutants Romanias CFR Cluj shocked AS Roma 2-1 on Tuesday but there were no surprises for big guns Chelsea, Liverpool, Barcelona or Inter Milan, who won their opening matches.         
	The long-time national team rightback Christian Panucci had put Roma ahead in the 16th minute at the Stadio Olimpico, but two goals from Juan Culio in the 28th and 49th minute handed the Romanians victory in Group A.         
	Starting this way at this level is incredible, Clujs Italian coach, Maurizio Trombetta, told reporters. We did all we could to shut down Romas play.         
	Disappointed Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi said: At the moment things are not working. Some of it is bad luck, but were making things complicated all by ourselves. But well get through it, weve done great things in the past.         
	Last seasons runners-up Chelsea opened their account in the same group with a 4-0 demolition of Girondins Bordeaux to give Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari his first win in the competition.         
	However, goals from Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Florent Malouda and Nicolas Anelka failed to satisfy the Brazilian.         
	We started very well, we got three points but we made too many mistakes. We did not control the game enough, we let them have too much of the ball, especially in the second half, but we did get two late goals, Scolari said.         
	Scolari though singled out Frank Lampard for praise saying he had been outstanding for the last three or four years in Europe.         
	He loves football, he trains hard every day and when you do this God helps you. If you didnt do this in training you would not do well in the match.         
	Liverpool coach Rafa Benitez was also disappointed despite his side coming from behind to beat Marseille 2-1 in Group D as briefly reported in Wednesdays late edition. A double from captain Steven Gerrard including a long range effort on target secured the points for the 2005 winners after Lorik Cana had put the French club ahead.         
	The team played well and he (Gerrard) played well but the team can play better and so can he, Benitez said.         
	We played good counter-attack, had quite a few clear chances and Im satisfied with our defence as well.         
	In a competition like this the first game is really important. That puts us in a good position but it was a tough match and both PSV Eindhoven and Atletico Madrid (the other teams in the group) will suffer here, Benitez added.         
	Atletico Madrid kicked off their campaign in the same group with a comfortable 3-0 win at PSV Eindhoven. Madrid easily overcame the Dutch champions with two goals in the first half from Sergio Aguero and a second half effort from Maniche.         
	Werder Bremen were surprisingly held to a goalless draw by Cypriot debutants Anorthosis Famagusta in Group B  the first team from the divided island to reach this stage of European soccers top competition.         
	But there were no such problems for Inter Milan in the other Group B game. Goals from Mancini and his replacement Adriano saw the Italians beat Panathinaikos 2-0 to give Jose Mourinho his first Champions League win as coach of the Serie A holders.         
	After losing their last three games, Barcelona got back to winning ways with a 3-1 home victory over Sporting Lisbon in Group C.         
	Rafael Marquez put Pep Guardiolas side ahead in the first half before Samuel Eto slotted home a penalty on the hour.

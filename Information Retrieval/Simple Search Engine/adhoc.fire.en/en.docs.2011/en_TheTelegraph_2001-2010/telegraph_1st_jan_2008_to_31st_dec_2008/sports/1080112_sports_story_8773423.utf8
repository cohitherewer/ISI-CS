	Durban: Centuries by Graeme Smith, Ashwell Prince and A.B. de Villiers put South Africa in a commanding position in the third and final Test against the West Indies on Friday. 
    
	The West Indies, who need 417 to make South Africa bat again, were 23 without loss in their second innings at stumps on the second day. 
    
	South Africa declared their first innings closed on 556 for four, made in reply to the West Indies 139. Smith scored 147, Prince made an undefeated 123 and De Villiers weighed in with 103 not out. 
    
	The centurions were supported by Hashim Amlas 69 and 74 by Jacques Kallis. 
    
	Smith and Amla resumed on 213 for one, and a cloudless sky denied the West Indian bowlers the overcast conditions that had made their South African counterparts a rasping threat on the first day. 
    
	Medium-pacer Darren Sammy struck in the ninth over of the day when Amla tried to work a delivery to the leg side and instead steered a catch to Dwayne Bravo at silly mid-off to halt the second-wicket stand at 199. 
    
	Six balls later Jerome Taylor had Smith caught-behind by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin, who dived in front of first slip to end an innings of four hours in which Smith faced 165 balls and hit 27 fours. 
    
	Prince and De Villiers dealt efficiently and forged ahead into the second hour after tea in an unbroken partnership that swelled to 182 before the declaration came after De Villiers scored his century. 
    
	Prince faced 196 balls and hit 15 fours, while De Villiers scored his runs off 109 deliveries with 15 fours and a six. 
    
	Daren Ganga (6) and debutant Brenton Parchment (17) successfully negotiated the 11 overs before stumps.

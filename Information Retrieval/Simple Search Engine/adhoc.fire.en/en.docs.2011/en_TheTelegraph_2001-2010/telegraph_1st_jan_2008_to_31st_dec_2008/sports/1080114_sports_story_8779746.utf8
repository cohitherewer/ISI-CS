                                                   Kapil: Indians best behaved

           
	Melbourne/New Delhi: An Australian newspapers lopsided effort to show that Indian cricketers are the worst-behaved in the game was on Sunday rubbished as misleading by Kapil Dev and some other former cricketers. 
    
	Even as Ricky Ponting and his team continued to face a barrage of criticism at home and abroad for their on-field conduct, a Sydney-based newspaper used ICC data to claim that it was in fact the Indian cricketers who were worst-behaved. 
    
	The Indians had faced action in 43 cases, the maximum for any team, followed by Pakistan with 39 cases, South Africa with 27 and Australia 25 penalties by the ICC since 1997, the newspaper reported but the Indians see these figures as lopsided and misleading. 
    
	The World Cup winning captain, Kapil, said: For the last 40 years, India have been the best-behaved team on and off the field. The players have always played in the true spirit of the game. 
    
	Aghast by the report, former opener and coach Aunshuman Gaekwad said: This statistics do not reflect the Indian teams conduct.

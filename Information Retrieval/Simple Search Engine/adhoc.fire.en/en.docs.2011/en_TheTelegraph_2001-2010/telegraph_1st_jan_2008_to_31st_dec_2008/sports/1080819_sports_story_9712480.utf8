	Liu Xiangs dream of defending his Olympic title on home soil ended on Monday when an injury forced him to hobble away from the track before his firstround heat in the 110 metres hurdles.

	Holyfield drops in         
	There was a surprise visitor at Akhil Kumars bout with Veaceslav Gojan of Moldova on Monday. None less than former world heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield. Occupying the pride of place and hogging all the attention, he sat watching Akhils bout (as also the two previous ones), says Our Correspondent. He obliged autograph hunters and posed for pictures but in spite of repeated pleas from journalists, didnt utter a word.

                                                      The international cricket council statements

        Harbhajan Singh in Perth on Monday 
   
	ICC Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle is confident that the third Test between Australia and India will be played in the best possible spirit between two great teams and that cricket will be back in the headlines for all the right reasons.
 
	This is what Madugalle, Anil Kumble and Ricky Ponting had to say, according to an ICC media release, issued on Monday: 
 
	Ranjan Madugalle: I have met the two captains and the managers separately over the past couple of days and then I talked to the two captains together today. I am happy to say that both Ricky Ponting and Anil Kumble were extremely supportive in all dealings I have had with them and I am in no doubt they want to move forward and draw a line under what happened in the past couple of weeks. Ricky and Anil understand and agree that the interest of the game is paramount and that it should always be played in the correct spirit and with mutual respect between opponents. The two captains know they are role models for millions of people and are aware of their responsibilities in projecting the game in a positive way. I am confident that after meeting with the two captains, we can all expect to watch an entertaining game of cricket played in a great spirit between these two fine teams.
 
	Anil Kumble: I value the meeting with Ranjan and also the meeting with Ranjan and Ricky Ponting together. Both the meetings were in the best interests of the game and have strengthened my belief that the game is of paramount importance. We have agreed that we must uphold the interests of the game and it would be our collective responsibility to ensure that the game of cricket is played by both the teams, as role models of this glorious game of cricket. 
 
	Ricky Ponting: I enjoyed a productive meeting which I had with Anil Kumble and Ranjan Madugalle in which we talked through all the issues thoroughly, said Ponting. I am convinced that both the teams can move into the next game clearly understanding the parameters under which the game should be played and the teams acknowledge that the game must be played in its true spirit.
 
	The India team manager, Chetan Chauhan, who had laid a charge under Level 3 of the ICCs Code of Conduct against Australia spinner Brad Hogg, has withdrawn the accusation prior to the hearing on Monday.
 
	Chauhan sent a letter, which was also signed by Kumble, to Match Referee Mike Procter citing the spirit of sportsmanship and the larger interests of the game. The letter asked him (Procter) to withdraw the charge on their behalf prior to the Code of Conduct hearing that had been scheduled to take place in Perth on Monday.
 
	As far as we are concerned, with the charge withdrawn, the case is dismissed and the matter is now closed, said Procter.
 
	The alleged offence had been reported under paragraph 3.3 of the ICC Code of Conduct which refers to players or team officials using language or gestures that offends, insults, humiliates, intimidates, threatens, disparages or vilifies another person on the basis of that persons race, religion, gender, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.
 
	The penalty for a Level 3 offence is a ban of between two and four Test matches or between four and eight one-day Internationals.

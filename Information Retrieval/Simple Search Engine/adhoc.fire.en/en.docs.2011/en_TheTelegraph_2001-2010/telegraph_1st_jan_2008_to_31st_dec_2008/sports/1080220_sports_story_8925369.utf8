The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sampras shows no mercy
                                                   Sampras shows no mercy
                      
	San Jose: Former world No. 1 Pete Sampras hit back-to-back aces to close out the second game of the second set and draw a plea from Tommy Haas.         
	Show some mercy, Pete Haas yelled.         
	Sampras began to hand his racket over to a ball boy before taking it back. Just as he did so often during his brilliant career, Sampras closed out the match with ease, beating Haas 6-4, 6-2 in an exhibition at the SAP Open on Monday.         
	It was Samprass second straight exhibition win against an active tour player, following Novembers straight-set victory over Roger Federer.

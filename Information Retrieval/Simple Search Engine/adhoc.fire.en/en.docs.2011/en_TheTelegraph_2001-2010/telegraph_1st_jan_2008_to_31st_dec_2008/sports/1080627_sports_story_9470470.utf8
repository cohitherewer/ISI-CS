	Karachi: Former captain Wasim Akram, one of the all-time great quicks, has no plans to join the support staff of the Pakistan team.         
	Contrary to reports, I havent been approached to become the bowling coach In any case, I dont have the time, Akram told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	Akram, who has media commitments to honour pretty regularly, added: Off and on, of course, I hold camps (at the Academy in Lahore) for emerging fast bowlers I had one fairly recently         
	Pakistans present coach, Geoff Lawson, is himself a former quick.

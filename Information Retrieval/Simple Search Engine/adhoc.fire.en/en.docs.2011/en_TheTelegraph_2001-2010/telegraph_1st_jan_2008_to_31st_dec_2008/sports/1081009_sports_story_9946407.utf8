The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We will put pressure on their fielding: Ricky Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                           We will put pressure on their fielding: Ricky Ponting
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Bangalore: Ricky Ponting made it clear on Wednesday that the Australians were looking to exploit the Indians poor fielding and running between the wickets during the four-match series.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Did Steve Waughs decision to retire take Australias focus away during the 2003-04 tour         
	A Im not sure if it took our whole focus away when Steve announced that he was going to retire. What it certainly does is create distractions. Theres no doubt that yesterday (Tuesday) afternoon and today the Indian team would have faced pressure of different proportions than theyre used to. We dealt with it pretty well when Steve announced his retirement and probably a bit differently when Adam Gilchrist announced his during the last series.         
	The pitch         
	The pitch has obviously been watered last afternoon and you can see that it has changed a bit. It looks very good to me. I was speaking to Greg Chappell and he thinks its the best one hes seen here in Bangalore. Its nice and hard so Id imagine it would be a very good batting surface for the first couple of days.         
	Putting pressure on the Indians in terms of fielding         
	Absolutely... Putting pressure on their fielding is something were certainly going to try and achieve in this series. Also putting a lot of pressure on their running between the wickets. If we can create a run out or a couple of run outs in each Test innings thats a huge achievement.         
	You must have discussed Souravs decision in the dressing room. What was Chappells reaction?         
	We havent spoken about it at all. It doesnt impact us at all. Whatever Souravs decision was his ownits none of our business really.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Force India owner Vijay Mallya could not hide his disappointment after Adrian Sutil crashed out of the Monaco Grand Prix seven minutes before the end on Sunday.         
	The German was running fourth when Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen rammed into the back of his VJM01, putting paid to a top five finish..         
	It was the saddest moment of my motor sports career, Mallya later said in a statement.         
	To achieve a top five position and that too in Monaco was a dream that ended just seven minutes and less than five laps from the chequered flag with Raikonnens Ferrari running into the rear of Sutils car, he said.

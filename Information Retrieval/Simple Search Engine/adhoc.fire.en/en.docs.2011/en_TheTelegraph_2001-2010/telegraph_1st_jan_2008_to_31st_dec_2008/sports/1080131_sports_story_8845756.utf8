	Singapore: Three from the Team India senior group  Test captain Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman  boarded Singapore Airlines Boeing 777-200 flight from Adelaide on Wednesday afternoon and, while the disappointment of not winning the Test series showed, their shoulders werent drooping. 
    
	After all, as Ricky Ponting acknowledged (and the Australian captain isnt exactly fida over Indian cricket), Kumble and Co. proved worthy competitors and deserve the No.2 ranking in Tests. 
    
	The passionate Kumble, however, isnt satisfied with being second-best. 
    
	Weve got the talent, weve got the characters and weve got the experience... If we continue to be consistent, day in and day out over the next 8-10 months, I dont see why we cant become No.1, Kumble told The Telegraph. 
    
	Thats the way forward for us and Im very happy that both the senior group and the younger lot made significant contributions in the Test series... I accept we were outplayed at the MCG (first Test), but we shouldve saved the SGC game... 
    
	Of course, the way we bounced back after Sydney was amazing... Few give visiting teams any chance in Perth, and most fold up in three days, yet we won (by 72 runs) inside four! Then, with a bowler short for almost the entire Test, we showed a lot of character at the Adelaide Oval, Kumble added. 
    
	The Perth win remains Kumbles stand out memory of the six weeks in Australia. Nobody got a hundred and nobody got a fiver, yet we won so handsomely... Rare for Indian cricket... Rare for other teams too. 
    
	Dravid top-scored, with 93 in the first innings. Among bowlers, Rudra Pratap Singh returned the best figures  four for 68 in Australias essay No.1. 
    
	While Kumble is proud of the way his team played, he agreed that the bottomline still showed a 1-2 defeat. 
    
	Yes, I accept that what matters is the bottomline and that we didnt win the four-Test series... The defeat hurts as wed gone to win... The perfect result wouldve been a 2-1 win or, at least, a 1-1 draw... We couldnt survive those few minutes at the SCG... That will stay a big disappointment, Kumble said. 
    
	Asked if Virender Sehwags success had vindicated his decision to back the opener at the selection meeting, Kumble replied: I certainly dont see it as a personal vindication... Sehwags a quality player with a proven record... Hed done well on our last tour of Australia (2003-04)... 
    
	The Test specialists wont be in action till the three-match series, at home, against South Africa. 
    
	Kumble is looking forward to the break  its always nice to get time with the family and time to take my camera out --- and expects the South Africans to provide tough opposition. 
    
	In recent times, theyve done pretty well in India and I expect a tough series. As an opposition, theyre good, Kumble signed off. 
    
	Footnote: Kumble and Dravid took a connecting flight to Bangalore, after the seven-hour journey from Adelaide, while Laxman headed for Hyderabad.

	Cameron White became the 402nd player to make his Test debut for Australia.         
	Ricky Ponting (123), when on 24, went past Sunil Gavaskar to move into the No. 6 position in the list of highest run-getters in Test cricket. Ponting is now behind Brian Lara (11953), Sachin Tendulkar (11877), Allan Border (11174), Steve Waugh (10927) and Rahul Dravid (10246).         
	Ponting scored only his second score of over fifty on Indian soil. He scored his previous fifty on March 13, 1998. It took him 10 years and 7 months to score another fifty on Indian soil.         
	Ponting surpassed his previous highest of 60 (Calcutta, 97-98) on Indian soil.         
	By scoring his 16th hundred as captain of Australia, Ponting now has the most centuries as captain. He bettered the performances of compatriots Alan Border and Steve Waugh, both of whom had scored 15 hundreds each as captains.         
	Ponting became the sixth Australian captain to score a hundred on Indian soil. However, his 123 is now the highest score by an Australian captain on Indian soil. Steve Waugh had made 110 at Calcutta in 2000-01.         
	Harbhajan Singh has now dismissed Ponting for the highest number (9) of times in Test cricket. He bettered Englands Darren Gough, who has dismissed Ponting on 8 occasions.         
	Michael Hussey registered his 9th Test hundred and his second against India. This was his second century outside Australia  the first being 182 against Bangladesh at Chittagong.         
	The unbeaten 68-run stand between Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir was their fifth 50-plus stand for the opening wicket in a row.         
	The partnership took the Sehwag-Gambhir partnership for the opening wicket to 1501 runs. In Indian Test cricket history, only Sunil Gavaskar and Chetan Chauhan (3010 runs) and Gavaskar and Anshuman Gaekwad (1722) have aggregated more runs for the first wicket.                 (COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON)

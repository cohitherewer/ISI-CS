	Bangalore: A splendid allround display enabled Rajasthan Royals cruise to a seven-wicket victory against Bangalore Royal Challengers in an IPL match on Saturday.         
	In reply to Bangalore outfits 135 for eight at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, the Aussie spin-legend Shane Warne-led Rajasthan Royals reached the target losing only three wickets with 17 balls to spare.         
	Man of the Match Shane Watson, who dismissed both Bangalore skipper Rahul Dravid and Shivnarine Chanderpaul early, stole the show with a well compiled unbeaten 61 off only 41 balls with eight fours and two sixes. Proteas captain Graeme Smith made a useful 49.           (PTI)

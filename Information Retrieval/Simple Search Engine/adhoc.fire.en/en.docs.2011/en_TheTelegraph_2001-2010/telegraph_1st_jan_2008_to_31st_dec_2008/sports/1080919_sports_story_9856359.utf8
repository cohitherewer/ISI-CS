The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I was never an express bowler, says Irfan
                                                                                                                                                                                                       I was never an express bowler, says Irfan
                  Irfan Pathan                     
	New Delhi: Often ridiculed for his pace, or rather lack of it, Irfan Pathan says he is really baffled by the entire fuss for the simple reason that he has never been an express bowler in the first place.         
	At some stage, Irfan was virtually being ridiculed for his dipping pace and diminishing swing but the left-arm seamer believes he never was a tearaway bowler and hence all the talk about losing pace is grossly unfair.         
	A lot of people talk about my swing and pace and I want to tell them that I was never a quick bowler. One must understand that even a spinner bowls slow. Its the variation which helps bowlers take wickets. I have always been a bowler who bowls at around 130-135 km/hr, Irfan said.         
	For those who believe he is losing his swing as well, the Baroda seamer said: I bowl first change these days and the worlds greatest would agree that the white ball stops swinging after the first 10-12 overs.         
	Mature enough to realise that he cannot avoid the constant scrutiny, Irfan said he would love his game to silence the critics.         
	I believe as long as you play cricket you will be criticised.         
	The critics will only stop when the cricketer finishes his career. One can only perform well and make them eat their words, he said.         
	Defending himself against constant criticism, Irfan pointed out to his kitty and said few players have achieved so much in so little time.           (PTI)

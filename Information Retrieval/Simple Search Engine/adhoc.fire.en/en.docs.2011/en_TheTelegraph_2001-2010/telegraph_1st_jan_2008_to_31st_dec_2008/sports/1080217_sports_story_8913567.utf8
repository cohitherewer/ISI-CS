The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 6-year-old who could be the next Rooney
                                                   6-year-old who could be the next Rooney
            Jeremy Wilson                      
	He is not quite 4ft tall and weighs just three and a half stone. However, six-year-old Archie Oates is becoming one of Englands most sought-after young footballers.         
	Archie, who has been nicknamed little Rooney, is already training with Chelsea FC after being spotted by one of their youth academy talent scouts at the age of five. He has dazzled coaches from various Premiership clubs with his ability to deliver perfect corners with both feet.         
	He can also hit shots that are powerful enough to have been struck by an adult. Tottenham, Arsenal, Watford and Queens Park Rangers are among the other clubs to have shown an interest. However, he trains once a week with Chelsea and may well register at the club in September 2009 at the grand old age of eight.         
	It is common for talent scouts to watch matches involving seven-year-olds. But a Chelsea scout was so impressed with Archies ability that he said he would like to see him train with the club immediately, according to Paul Fitzgerald, the boys coach at the more modest Belmont United in north London. The Chelsea scout told me, Im very interested in taking on the little lad, he said.         
	At the time, Archie, who lives in Edgware, north London, was playing his first competitive match with the older boys of Belmonts under-eights.         
	Mr Fitzgerald, said: He has scored six or seven in a few matches. He has got a great shot, he is not afraid to tackle someone twice his size and only ever needs to be told something once, but it is his skills which are unique. The coaches at Chelsea rave about him  they say he is special. He is exceptional. He listens and he goes away and practises all the skills and picks them up very quickly. He is unique. He can play in every position.         
	Archies mother, Charlotte Pett, said: He is happy at Chelsea. They came over after a match and asked if he wanted to train with them. I think he is the youngest one there. He could train at a different club every single day but I just want him to enjoy it.         
	All he thinks about is football. It is all he is interested in. He has Sky Sports in his bedroom and when he is not playing, he is watching it.         
	He watches all the leagues  the Italian, the Spanish football and understands it all and knows all the players. His ideal person is Wayne Rooney and he even looks a bit like him.         
	Coaches have predicted that he is likely to one day play in the same position as the Manchester United and England forward. Rooney started playing at Everton just before his 11th birthday.         
	Young players can register for a clubs Premier League academy during the school year in which they turn nine. This means they train exclusively at one club for a year, or, from the age of 12, for two years. Players may sign professional contracts at 17. On Friday night, Chelsea FC confirmed that Archie was training at the club, but played down the boys involvement.         
	A spokesman was reluctant to give details of younger players for fear of putting too much pressure on them.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Calcutta: India will have to wait until Saturday to know their opponents in the Under-19 World Cup final after the semi-final between South Africa and Pakistan was interrupted by rain.         
	Asked to bat first, the South African colts scored a challenging 260 for eight in their allotted 50 overs. A rain interruption reduced the target for Pakistan to 252 in 47 overs and the defending champions were 86 for two when weather gods interfered once again.         
	The on-field umpires decided to resume the semi-final Saturday.         
	According to an ICC release, Pakistan began their chase in a shaky manner, losing both opener Umar Akmal and No. 3 Shaan Khan with just 15 runs on the board.         
	But Ahmad Shahzad and Umar Amin dug in and put together a good partnership in the face of some fine SA bowling, particularly in the shape of left-arm mediumpacer Wayne Parnell, who was getting the new ball to swing in prodigiously.         
	Shahzad and Amin then took the score to 86 for 2 off 18.5 overs before the covers were on again.         
	Opener J J Smuts (59 off 83 balls), Riley Rossouw (53 off 71 balls) and Jonathan Vandiar (50 off 50 balls) took control after they lost their first wicket at the score of 35.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen century fails to stop Indias run
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pietersen century fails to stop Indias run
            SUDIPTO GANGULY                      
	Cuttack: Kevin Pietersens unbeaten hundred proved futile as the Indian juggernaut kept rolling on, crushing England by six wickets in the fifth ODI at the Barabati Stadium here on Wednesday.         
	The visitors lost their fifth match in a row and with two ODIs left in the series, chances of a 7-0 whitewash by India dont look remote.         
	The Indians won with 6.2 overs to spare, courtesy half centuries from Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Suresh Raina.         
	England managed a total of 270 for four in their 50 overs after Dhoni decided to field first on winning the toss  a decision keeping in mind the dew factor.         
	The India captains decision, however, came as a surprise to his opposite number. I would have definitely batted first had I won the toss, Pietersen said after the toss.         
	But Dhoni had the last laugh as the enormous amount of dew on the ground made it difficult for the England spinners to grip the ball.         
	Pietersen later was forced to admit that the dew made a huge difference. The ball had become a soap ball. All our bowlers were slipping on their mark, the England captain said.         
	It was very difficult for the spinners to grip the ball. Graeme Swann was bowling seam up at the end.         
	Both teams made two changes in the playing XI from the one that played in Bangalore last Sunday. Rohit Sharma, who had made way for Tendulkars return in the team, replaced Gautam Gambhir on Wednesday. India also replaced Munaf Patel with Irfan Pathan.         
	Ian Bell, who had been out of runs throughout the ODI series, got the axe and was replaced by Alastair Cook. Steve Harmison replaced a wayward James Anderson in the bowling department.         
	Sehwag (91) and Tendulkar (50) stitched together an opening partnership of 136 runs and at that stage it looked curtains for England.         
	But England picked up three quick wickets to stage a comeback. Sehwag, adjudged the man of the match, completely destroyed the English attack during his 73-ball stay. He blasted 15 fours and one huge six during the course of his innings. He ripped apart off-spinner Swann in his very first over, hitting three boundaries and a six to notch up 21 runs.         
	Tendulkar looked a bit edgy at the start but grew in confidence as his innings progressed. He hit six boundaries during his 57-ball knock, including some exquisite off drives and flicks of the hip.         
	The maestro fell in similar fashion to his last innings dismissal in Bangalore. The ball crashed onto his stumps after he went for an off-drive.         
	Yuvraj Singh, who was promoted to the No. 3 spot, didnt last long and fell to part-timer Ravi Bopara. It was a soft dismissal for the left-hander as the ball seemed to stop on him and Yuvraj offered a return catch to Bopara.         
	Sehwag fell on the very next ball, out leg before to Stuart Broad. The Indian vice-captain might consider himself unlucky, as the ball seemed to be sliding down the leg side.         
	Dhoni (51) and Suresh Raina (53 ..) then clamed the nerves, stitching together a partnership of 94 runs. The duo first played out a few overs quietly and then went on the attack.         
	Dhoni, when on 22, survived a strong appeal for caught behind followed by one for stumping. The stumping was mighty close but the third umpire gave Dhoni the benefit of doubt after a number of replays proved inconclusive. The Indian captain departed, with the total on 250, out leg before to Swann. Raina along with Rohit Sharma took India home.         
	Earlier, captain Pietersen notched up the first hundred in the series for England.         
	Pietersen, who walked in at the fall of opener Alastair Cook, stayed unbeaten for his 111 from 128 balls. His innings was studded with 10 hits to the boundary and a six of off-spinner Harbhajan Singh. The over boundary off Harbhajan also took him to 3000 runs in ODI cricket.         
	The England captain raced to his fifty off only 59 balls, with seven boundaries. He slowed down a bit while he neared his century. It made a difference of at least 10 runs to the eventual score.         
	The Indians were guilty of bowling a bit more on the pads of Pietersen and the England captain wasnt complaining.         
	Pietersen added 89 runs with Paul Collingwood (40) for the third wicket and then picked up the run rate with Owais Shah (66 not out) during an unbroken 112-run stand.         
	Zaheer picked up both the openers in his first spell. The left-arm pacer hit the deck hard and extracted good bounce off the Barabati pitch. Harbhajan and Ishant Sharma picked up the other two wickets to fall.

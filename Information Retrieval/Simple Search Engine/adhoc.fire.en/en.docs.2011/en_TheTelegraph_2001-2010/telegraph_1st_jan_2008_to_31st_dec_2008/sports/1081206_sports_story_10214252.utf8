                                                                                                                                                                                                       A complete player   vs a lethal left foot
  - THE BIG DEBATE: WHO IS THE GREATEST?             Pele                                 
	The debate never stops. Who is the greatest ever footballer in the world  Pele or Maradona! Some of the most well-known names of Indian football expressed their views on this sensitive issue to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically):         
	 Shabbir Ali: I consider Pele the greatest ever player though I have great respect for players like Maradona or Johan Cruyff. During the days of Pele in the 60s, skilled players never received the required protection from the referees. The law was such that Pele used to be a victim of foul play. Yet, he won the World Cup at the age of 17.         
	 Manoranjan Bhattacharya: Pele was great but we have watched more of Maradona than the Brazilian. His skills had a magical effect on the present day football fans. Pele is a three-time World Cup winner but Maradona waged a lone battle to bag the 1986 World Cup. His goals were incredible.         
	 Subhas Bhowmick: According to me, Pele is the greatest ever footballer. I strongly believe in consistency and Pele was more consistent than Maradona. Pele won the World Cup thrice, but Maradona could excel in only one. The Argentines main weapon was his left foot. Pele was a complete player. He was equally proficient in shooting, dribbling and heading.         
	 Bhaichung Bhutia: Both were great players of different eras, so I cannot keep one ahead of the other. Pele was a complete footballer. He possessed every skill that a player can have. He was also very good in the air. Maradona had a breathtaking left foot that made him the greatest player of our time. It is difficult to compare the two.                   Maradona       
	 Arun Ghosh: Pele stands a little ahead of Maradona because he is more successful. That he won three World Cups is a clear testimony of his greatness. Maradona was a fabulous player but he could showcase his skills in only one World Cup. I had the opportunity to watch him during the 1990 World Cup in Italy, but he couldnt impress.         
	 Chuni Goswami: It is difficult to draw a comparison between the two. Along with Alfredo di Stefano they are considered the three greatest footballers, but it is not possible to list them in order of merit. True Pele was a complete player, but Maradona was a spectacular dribbler. Dribbling, after all, is the most difficult art in football.         
	 Syed Nayeemuddin: Maradona is the greatest ever footballer. Pele won the World Cup thrice but he had some highly skilful players in the team. Maradona did it almost single-handedly. People say Maradona does not lead a disciplined life. But since Fifa has given him the Player of the Century award, we have no right to talk about Maradonas lifestyle.         
	 Inder Singh: In all respects, Pele is the greatest player in the world. As a footballer his achievements were far more than Maradona. Pele was an allround footballer. He used to shoot with both legs and was a powerful header of the ball. Even after retiring, Pele has carried himself in an extremely dignified manner.         
	 Shyam Thapa: On the field, both Pele and Maradona were the greatest footballers during their playing days. However, off the field Pele is ahead. In at least 50 countries, Pele doesnt need a visa to enter. Maradona was not allowed to enter Japan during the World Cup in Asia. I respect his skills but will tell young kids to emulate Pele.         
	 I.M. Vijayan: My vote is for Maradona. I havent seen a better player than him. We were all footballers, he was a super footballer. I have seen some videos of Pele. No doubt he was an extraordinary player but none can win a game single-handedly like Maradona. His was a one-man army. Not even a magician can match his dribbling skills.

	Bangalore: Staging a remarkable recovery, Geet Sethi outplayed Devendra Joshi to enter the final of the point format of the ONGC IBSF World Billiards Championship on Thursday.         
	In an all-Indian semi-final, veteran Sethi trailed by three games before bouncing back in style in a tremendous show of grit and determination at the Karnataka State Billiards Association hall.         
	Digging deep into his wealth of experience, Sethi came from behind and eventually won five games to three  (102-151, 95-151, 2-151, 150-126, 152-57, 152-16, 152-112, 150-0).         
	Meanwhile, Pankaj Advani also entered the title round with a hard-fought five games to three victory over Rupesh Shah, and will clash with Sethi on Friday.         
	The 23-year old Bangalorean lost the second, fourth , and fifth games in a see-saw battle before clinching the next three to emerge victorious. Advani won 150-115, 91-152, 150-142, 49-151, 98-152, 151-118, 151-16, 150-93.

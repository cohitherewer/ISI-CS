The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Security beefed up for players
                                                                                                                                                                                           Security beefed up for players

	Bhubaneswar: Police left hundreds of cricket lovers dejected as they whisked away India and England cricketers through separate routes as soon as they landed here on a chartered plane on Monday.         
	The fifth ODI will be played in Cuttack on Wednesday. India, who lead 4-0, have already sealed the series with their victory in Bangalore.         
	Supporters who had gathered at the Biju Patnaik airport here since early morning to catch a glimpse of their favourite cricketers went home disappointed.         
	The security arrangements were meticulously planned in advance in view of the unpleasant incident which took place about two years ago when the then Team India coach Greg Chappell was allegedly slapped by a Kalinga Sena activist at the airport.         
	We had to make alternative arrangements in order to avoid any untoward incident at the airport, commissioner of police B. K. Sharma said, adding that adequate security was provided for the safety of the players.         
	This time we ensured that nothing of that sort takes place, Sharma said. We are maintaining utmost vigil, Sharma said.         
	The match would take place 25 km away at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack. Elaborate arrangements had been made to safely escort the players and support staff of both the teams to Cuttack and back. The teams spent the day at the hotel and will practice in the afternoon on Tuesday.         
	After their arrival, team members were accorded a ceremonial welcome amid beating of drums and showering of flower petals and kept in the high security zone of the hotel located in Nayapalli area.

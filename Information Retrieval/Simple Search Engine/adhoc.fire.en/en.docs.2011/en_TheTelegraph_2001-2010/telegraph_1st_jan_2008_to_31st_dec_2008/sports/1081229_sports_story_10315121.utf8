                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fernandos secret deal
                      
	Rome: Fernando Alonso has a secret agreement to join Ferrari for four years from 2011, Italian sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport reported on Sunday.         
	The twice Formula One world champion has never hidden his desire to go to the Italian team and Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo recently fuelled the ongoing speculation by refusing to rule out the Spaniards future arrival.         
	The newspaper said the deal had several get-out clauses for both sides.         
	A Ferrari spokesman would not comment on the reports, apart from saying: We can only repeat that we have two drivers signed to the end of 2010.           (REUTERS)

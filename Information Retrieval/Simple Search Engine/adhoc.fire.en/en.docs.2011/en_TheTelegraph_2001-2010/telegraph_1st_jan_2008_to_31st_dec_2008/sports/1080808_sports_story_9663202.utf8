                                                                                                                                                                                                     Will try and stay calm: Parthiv
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: Dinesh Karthik got his chances, but hardly made the most of them, in the first two Tests. Its no surprise, then, that hes out of the Team India XI and wont figure in the decider.         
	The beneficiary is, of course, 23-year-old Parthiv Patel, whose last Test was way back in October 2004.         
	Bahut accha lag raha hai... Im very happy, Parthiv told The Telegraph on Thursday evening. Earlier in the day, captain Anil Kumble gave him the good news.         
	Asked if was feeling the pressure, Parthiv laughed and said: Not at the moment...Ill try and stay calm...         
	Wife Avnis presence should help him relax.         
	Parthiv, incidentally, has been made the 16th player for the five-match one-day series which starts less than a week after the final Test ends.         
	He wont forget Thursday in a hurry.

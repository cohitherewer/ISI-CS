                                                                                                                                                                                                     IPL faces channel blackout
                      
	New Delhi: After sorting out almost all the issues with the print media, the Indian Premier League on Tuesday faced a boycott of its coverage by major television channels.         
	The decision, which came under the umbrella organisation of news broadcasters association, was conveyed by the secretary general to IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi on Tuesday.         
	The TV channels were protesting against exclusive rights given to Sony Network and IPLs refusal to discuss the issue with them.         
	The association has written a letter to Modi.         
	At the end of the day, therefore, our members are left with a partial and unsatisfactory response to our attempts to ensure a balanced approach between their rights to fair use and the rights and interests of IPL, and establish a relationship based on mutuality of interests and equity in law, the letter read.           (PTI)

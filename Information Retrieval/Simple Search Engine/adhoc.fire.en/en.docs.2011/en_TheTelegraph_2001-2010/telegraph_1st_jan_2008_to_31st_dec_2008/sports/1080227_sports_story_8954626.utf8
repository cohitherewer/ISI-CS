                                                   Kapil wants more from Sachin 

           
	Gurgaon: Former India captain Kapil Dev on Tuesday said Sachin Tendulkar could silence his critics by performing in the best-of-three finals. 
    
	The top players are expected to be at their best in important matches and what better stage than the finals, Kapil said on the sidelines of a golfing event. 
    
	There are a lot of expectations from Sachin and there is nothing wrong in that. If a star player like him fails in seven matches, people will ask questions, the 1983 World Cup-winning captain said. 
    
	Kapil said India had the capability to beat Australia but needed to be more consistent. He seemed impressed with Mahendra Singh Dhonis skill as a captain. 
    
	Whatever he (Dhoni) decides is in the teams interest. He is leading the side very well and he should be given total freedom. 
    
	Kapil said India had a good bowling attack but nowhere close to being the worlds best. 
    
	They are better than what we were but the boys need to work hard on their game, he added. (PTI)

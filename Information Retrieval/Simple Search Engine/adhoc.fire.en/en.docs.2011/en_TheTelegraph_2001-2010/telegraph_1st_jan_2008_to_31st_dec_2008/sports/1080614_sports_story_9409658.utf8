The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB puts Malik on notice
                                                                                                                                                                                                     PCB puts Malik on notice
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dhaka: Shoaib Malik has been virtually put on notice by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). The Pakistan captain has been asked to crack the whip and stage a dramatic improvement in the teams performance before the end of the Asia Cup at home next month or face the axe.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf, who arrived here on Friday on a scheduled visit, has made that clear to Malik during a meeting this evening. Ashraf, who avoided the media, also met coach Geoff Lawson and the players.         
	Ashrafs leaked email, seeking an explanation from the team management after the embarrassing loss to India here, has already caused a stir. Manager Talat Ali has also not been spared and told to be more stringent in matters of selection.         
	Malik, who took charge after the World Cup in the Caribbean last year, got his tenure extended till December but it wont surprise if he is removed before the end of his term. Misbah-ul Haq is tipped to take over in such an eventuality.         
	Shahid Afridis name has also been doing the rounds but his inconsistency is being seen as a deterrent. Younis Khan has made it clear in the past that he isnt keen on taking charge. The PCB doesnt want to hand over the leadership to senior pro Mohammed Yousuf.         
	Lawson has already blamed some seniors for their non-performance in a recent outburst. The latest developments have again left the PCB, already struggling to save face after the Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif controversies, in the lurch.         
	While Asifs fate has evoked sympathy among his teammates, Shoaib does not enjoy such luck. Many believe Asif has been a victim of circumstances.         
	Coming from a lower middle-class background Asif has failed to handle success, which has been instant, said a teammate. That seems to be the common consensus. No one, however, is accepting the fact that he may have taken to drugs.         
	How then was he caught at Dubai Airport on charges of drug possession? That is the million-dollar question doing the rounds in the Pakistan camp.         
	Asif had become very cautious after being implicated in a doping scandal during the Champions Trophy in 2006. The latest scandal doesnt really make sense He has been a regular to Dubai and is aware of the stringent rules there. So why on earth should he do this, the cricketer said.         
	For Shoaib, the door is almost shut, barring a dramatic turn of events. No one wants to create problems in the team with Shoaibs presence, said a source.

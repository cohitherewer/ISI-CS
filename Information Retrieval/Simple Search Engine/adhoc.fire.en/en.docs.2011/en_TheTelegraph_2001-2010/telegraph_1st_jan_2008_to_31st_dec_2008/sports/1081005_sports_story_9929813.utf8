                                                                                                                                                                                                     We will make the AFC Cup final: Colaco
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Dempo coach Armando Colaco is confident that given a long time contract, he is capable of transforming the national team into one of the best in Asia.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph a few hours before leaving for Beirut to play the historic AFC Cup semi-final against Lebanons Safa club on Tuesday, Colaco said he was ready to take up the challenge but no one in the football federation had ever bothered to offer him an opportunity.         
	I am not going to beg around after achieving so much at the club level, said the Goa based coach, considered one of Indias most successful club coaches in recent times.         
	After winning back to back National League (now I-League) titles for Dempo, I have now taken them to the AFC Cup semi-finals. I have been told that no Indian club could ever make this grade before, said the Dempo coach.         
	I am sure the boys will take the team to the final also, Colaco added. They are playing wonderful football. I am really proud of them.         
	Colaco said it wont be difficult for him to emulate what the national team have achieved in the past one year.         
	If the authorities are ready to give me a three-year stint and all the facilities that the current coach is getting, I can also achieve the same, Colaco said.

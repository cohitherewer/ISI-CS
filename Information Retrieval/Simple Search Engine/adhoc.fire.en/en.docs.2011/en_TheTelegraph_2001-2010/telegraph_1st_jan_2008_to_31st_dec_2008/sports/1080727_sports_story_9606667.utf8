            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: On a day when referrals made a very big impact in Team Indias innings and 239-run defeat at the SSC, that was one of the major talking points during the post-match news conference.         
	The following are what the players had to say:         
	MAHELA JAYAWARDENE: This is probably one of the reasons why it came If it wasnt there, we probably would have had four bad decisions going against us in this Test. Sachins and Rahuls decisions were both tough ones for the umpires to pick up Especially when you have two bowlers like Murali (Muttiah Muralidharan) and Ajantha (Mendis) going at the batsmen on these kind of tracks. It is not easy. They just needed that extra bit of help. I am all for it.         
	MUTTIAH MURALIDHARAN  Its (a) very good (system). Umpires are under lesser pressure. They dont have any rest and their concentration levels have to be very high. It has relaxed the minds of the umpires. Because of this, major clashes like what happened in Australia can be eliminated. No one can complain that we lost due to bad decisions  no more excuses.         
	ANIL KUMBLE  It is a bit too early to comment on it. Will have to sit and work out how the technology will help us. Couple of our calls were negated. We will have to take it forward.

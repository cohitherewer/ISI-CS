The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sebastian Vettel romps home 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sebastian Vettel romps home 
                      
	Monza: Germanys Sebastian Vettel stunned Formula One as the sports youngest race winner at the age of 21 on Sunday with victory for tiny Toro Rosso at their home Italian Grand Prix.         
	Vettel, also the youngest driver to start a Grand Prix from pole position, gave his Ferrari-powered team their first win with a remarkably assured drive through the spray and slippery conditions.         
	It was a stunning result for Formula Ones smallest team, formerly tail-enders Minardi, who are co-owned at least until the end of next year by Red Bull energy drink billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz and Austrian Gerhard Berger.         
	McLarens Lewis Hamilton, who started 15th, retained his championship lead by a single point after overtaking a string of rivals to finish seventh.         
	Ferraris Brazilian Felipe Massa failed to make the most of starting nine places ahead of the Briton and finished sixth in a wet race that began behind the safety car.         
	With four races remaining, Hamilton has 78 points to Massas 77 and Robert Kubicas 64 for BMW-Sauber, pending an appeal into the result of the Belgian Grand Prix where the championship leader was demoted from first to third for cutting a chicane.         
	Its amazing, I cant believe it. Im lost for words, said Vettel over the radio after taking the chequered flag 12.5 seconds clear of McLarens Heikki Kovalainen.         
	It is the best day of my life. These pictures and emotions I will never forget, he added later. Kubica took third place.         
	At 21 years and 74 days old, Vettel became Germanys first race winner since Ferraris seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher retired in 2006. Fernando Alonso finished fourth.         
	Germanys Nick Heidfeld was fifth for BMW-Sauber while Australian Mark Webber collected the final point in eighth place for Red Bull.         
	Giancarlo Fisichella could not cash in on his 12th place start and crashed out while his Force India teammate Adrian Sutil came a lowly 19th in the wet Italian Grand Prix here today.

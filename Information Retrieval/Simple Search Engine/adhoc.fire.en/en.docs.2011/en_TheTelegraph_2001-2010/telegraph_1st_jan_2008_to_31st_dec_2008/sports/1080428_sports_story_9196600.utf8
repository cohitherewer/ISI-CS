	Perth: India conceded an extra-time goal to lose 1-2 to China and finished last in the four-nation hockey tournament here on Sunday.         
	India had beaten their northern neighbours 3-1 in their last league match on Saturday but they played the catching up game on Sunday before eventually finishing with the wooden spoon.         
	India had lost their first round-robin league match 1-4 to Korea but came back strongly to hold the Australians 2-2 and thumped China 3-1 in their next two matches only to be pipped to the post for a spot in the final by Korea. Australia beat Korea 4-3 in the final to win the tournament.         
	In Kazan, Indian women let in a late goal and conceded another in extra time to go down 1-2 to Netherlands Antilles and squander the bronze. (PTI)

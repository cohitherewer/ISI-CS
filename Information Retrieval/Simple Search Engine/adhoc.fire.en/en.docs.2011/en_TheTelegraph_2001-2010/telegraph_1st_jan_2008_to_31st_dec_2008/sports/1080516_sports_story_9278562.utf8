The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I can handle Bhajji, Sree: Kirsten
                                                                                                                                                                                           I can handle Bhajji, Sree: Kirsten
                                        Gary Kirsten feels passion is needed in the Team India camp    
	New Delhi: Team India coach Gary Kirsten does not foresee slap-gate protagonists Harbhajan Singh and Sreesanth sharing cold vibes in the dressing room but the South African says even if it comes to that, he has the requisite skill to handle the situation.         
	The idea that it will be a problem having the two of them together in the squad is crazy.         
	I would like to think me and Paddy (Upton) have enough management experience to cope with anything like that, if it ever did become a problem, Kirsten was quoted as saying by a website on Thursday.         
	Harbhajan slapped Sreesanth after an Indian Premier League (IPL) match last month allegedly after being needled by the Kerala pacer.         
	The temperamental off-spinner was subsequently banned from the ongoing edition of the IPL and fined Rs 3 crore before being handed an additional five-match ODI ban by the BCCI on Wednesday.         
	Reflecting on one of the ugliest episodes in Indian cricket, Kirsten said the incident occurred because both Harbhajan and Sreesanth were passionately competitive players who tend to lose control over their temper rather easily.         
	They are both very passionate cricketers who, ironically, are as similar off the field as on it. On the friendly side of the boundary rope I have found them to be extremely friendly, inoffensive and helpful people, he said.         
	But when they cross the line, literally, they become very passionate and their blood boils quickly, Kirsten said.         
	Kirsten hoped the players would realise their mistakes and mend ways after the embarrassment it caused to both of them.         
	They have both made mistakes and they know that. Harbhajan has paid an enormous price for his latest indiscretion and I honestly have no doubt that he has learnt his lesson, he said.         
	The former Proteas opener said he spoke to Harbhajan on the issue and realised that the flamboyant bowler was still deeply apologetic about his action.         
	I had a long chat over the phone with him recently and he knows he made a big mistake. I think he wanted to know where he stood with me and I was able to reassure him that I wanted him in my team.         
	Hes a passionate bloke and I want passion in the team, India need passion to win. Of course, it has to be controlled and ill discipline is unacceptable. There is a difference between sporting aggression and plain loss of temper, and he knows that, Kirsten said.         
	The coach said Harbhajan was keen to move on and was looking to make a resounding comeback after serving his ban that would see him miss the tri-series against Bangladesh and Pakistan besides two matches of the Asia Cup.         
	Hes still concerned but hes desperate to put it behind him and move on. He made a bad error of judgement and hes very determined that it wont happen again. And I think he realises the consequences if it does, he said.         
	The Team India coach, in his personal website  www.garykirsten.com  said that Test cricket needs a radical overhaul to be in vogue in the face of the Twenty20 revolution.         
	I believe the time is ripe to create a world league system for Test cricket. The game needs to have a world champion every year, the former South African opening batsman said.         
	Its what keeps people interested, involved and engaged.         
	The idea of an annual Test championship comprising one-off Test matches between the nine or 10 Test-playing nations, I believe would create global interest.         
	Four home games one year, five the next. It would mean every Test playing nation would play nine or 10 Tests per year which would count towards the championship, he said.

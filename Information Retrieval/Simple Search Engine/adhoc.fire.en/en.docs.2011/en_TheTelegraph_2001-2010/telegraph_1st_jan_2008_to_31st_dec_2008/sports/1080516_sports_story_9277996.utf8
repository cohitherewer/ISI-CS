The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sharapova: Shes an inspiration
                                                                                                                                                                                           Sharapova: Shes an inspiration
                      
	Brussels: The tennis fraternity has reacted to the sudden retirement of world No. 1 Justine Henin with surprise. The following is a selection of tributes to the Belgian (In alphabetical order):         
	ROGER FEDERER: Its obviously a shock for the tennis world. Its a particular surprise before Roland Garros and Wimbledon, which shes never won. Its quite surprising and unfortunate that shes out of the game but she will have her reasons. She is a special player because she can play on any surface and its remarkable that shes won so many tournaments because she is small and the tall players coming in now have an advantage.         
	I couldnt imagine deciding out of the blue to retire, especially if I was number one. I would prefer to take a year off if it was all getting too much for me, rather than saying straight out that Im not going to go on.         
	ANA IVANOVIC: (Tennis loses) another champion, a great player who brought a lot to the womens game. She had a different game to any other woman on the tour. Im sorry to hear this.         
	BILLIE JEAN KING: Pound for pound Justine is the best player of her generation. I trust she has not come to this decision quickly or easily and I wish her the very best. Justine is an extraordinary player, a special person and a true champion in both tennis and in life.         
	MARIA SHARAPOVA: Shes 25 years old and shes achieved so much in her career. If I was 25 and Id won so many Grand Slams Id quit too. Without being the strongest or the biggest, shes won so much. Shes an inspiration. Theres so many things to life and Im sure she wants to explore them. I definitely dont blame her for retiring.         
	SERENA WILLIAMS: She was a great champion and she gave me a world of trouble, so I hope the best for her. What can you say about such a great champion? I dont think we have enough time.         
	VENUS WILLIAMS: She was a great opponent. She always challenged herself to play her best tennis, no matter what the circumstances. A real fighter.           (REUTERS)

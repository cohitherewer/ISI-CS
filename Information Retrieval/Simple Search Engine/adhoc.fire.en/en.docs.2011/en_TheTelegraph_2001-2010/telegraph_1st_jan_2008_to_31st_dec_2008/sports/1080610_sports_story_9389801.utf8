The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Were totally keyed up for this match: Kirsten
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Were totally keyed up for this match: Kirsten
                      
	Dhaka: Team India coach Gary Kirsten has no doubt that Tuesdays match between India and Pakistan would live up to expectations and there is no lack of motivation in the Indian camp.         
	He expects a great game on Tuesday. I am sure it is going to be great game tomorrow. Every India and Pakistan match is a great match. I know our guys are totally keyed up for this match, he said after Mondays training session.         
	My players are motivated for the game and want to do well. I have no concerns about the intensity of the match tomorrow, though it is a big game. It is something we have given some considerations and thoughts too. We need to make sure that our game plan and strategies are designed for 50 overs cricket. It is different to what they did in IPL. So, we worked hard during the last two days to get things right.         
	Kirsten said he watched Sundays game between Pakistan and Bangladesh to get an idea of the pitch and the outfield. I had a look at it today as well and I do not think it is going to be different. We have got an idea as to how the pace is going to be and we plan accordingly, he said.         
	Talking about Virender Sehwags chances of playing Tuesdays match, Kirsten said: He has got a mild cold. As a precautionary measure, we thought we could give him some rest. Otherwise, there are no fitness worries. Everyone is fit and firing, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson talked of extending their 12-match unbeaten run by routing India.         
	We do not want to treat the match as a must win one and put ourselves under pressure. We want to play our own game. Twelve games in a row is our best so far and the Australians have won 22 . To beat their record we need to play every game seriously, including the one tomorrow against India, Lawson said.

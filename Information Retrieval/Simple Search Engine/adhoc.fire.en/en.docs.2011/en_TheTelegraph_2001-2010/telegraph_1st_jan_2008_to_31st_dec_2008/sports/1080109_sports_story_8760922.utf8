  - Hobart meet 
  -   Sixth-seeded Indian to face Pennetta               Sania beat Kudryavtseva 6-3, 6-4                           
	Hobart: Sixth seed Sania Mirza advanced to the quarter finals of the $1,70,000 Moorilla Hobart International with a straight sets victory over Russian Alla Kudryavtseva on Tuesday.         
	Sania beat Kudryavtseva 6-3, 6-4 and will now face Italian Flavia Pennetta in the Tier IV hard court event.         
	Pennetta advanced after Australian qualifier Jelena Dokic pulled out midway through the first set of their second-round match with an ankle injury. Pennetta was leading 5-0 when Dokic retired.         
	Dokic, a former world No. 4, is still to decide whether she will attempt to qualify for next weeks Australian Open.         
	The 24-year-old, who received courtside treatment but was unable to continue, later said she had sustained the injury in qualifying on Sunday and played with it in her first-round victory over Martina Mueller on Monday.         
	Dokic, who did not receive a wild card from Australian Open organisers and was considering whether to play the wild card qualifying tournament beginning on Thursday, said she would need to see how her ankle responded.         
	Its not something thats really serious, so hopefully it will settle down. Well see what happens tomorrow. Ill have to make a really hard decision on Thursday.         
	In other matches on Tuesday, Russian second seed Vera Zvonareva beat Romanias Ioana Raluca Olaru 6-3, 6-2 while Eleni Daniilidou of Greece provided the upset of the day with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over top seed Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine.         
	Daniilidou will now meet Australian Casey Dellacqua, who made her first WTA quarter final with a tough 6-4, 4-6, 6-1 victory over Russian Anna Lapushchenkova.         
	In the Sydney International, Justine Henin made the quarter finals without playing a match. The Belgian received a walkover on Tuesday when Lucie Safarova of Czech Republic was unable to play her second-round match due to a strained buttock.         
	A two-time Sydney champion, Henin had already received a first-round bye because she was among the tournaments top four seeds. (AGENCIES)

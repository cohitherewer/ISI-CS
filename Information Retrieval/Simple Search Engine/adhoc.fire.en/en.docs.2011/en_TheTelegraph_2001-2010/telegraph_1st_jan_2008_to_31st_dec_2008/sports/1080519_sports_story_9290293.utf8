The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We wouldve chased anyway, says Chennai captain Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We wouldve chased anyway, says Chennai captain Dhoni
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: For a man who grins even during adversity, its but natural that Mahendra Singh Dhoni would be smiling after Chennai Super Kings pulled off a two-run victory (via D/L method) over Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden on Sunday.         
	At the end of the rain-curtailed match, Dhoni, sporting the team jersey, said he would have chosen to field anyway because there was always a threat of rain. The captain, however, refused to speculate on Chennais chances of reaching the semi-finals, saying they are taking one match at a time.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Chennai bowlers performing better this time         
	They did well They didnt give too many loose runs away and bowled tightly during the middle overs. Forced the batsmen to make mistakes and capitalised on them.         
	Batting second         
	We would have batted second anyway. There was always the threat of rain and Duckworth/Lewis method coming into action. In this format where its all over in 20 overs, its always better to chase. So that was always at the back of my mind.         
	Whether path to semi-finals has become easier         
	We dont want to look too far ahead. Just want to take one match at a time.         
	On Kevin Pietersens possible arrival in the next edition of the IPL         
	Hell possibly have a big impact. Hes supposed to do well but in this format its not about individuals. Its about teamwork. The trick is to perform as a team. One individual may see you through occasionally but if you dont fire as team its difficult to sustain the momentum.         
	akhaya Ntinis hattrick         
	We didnt even know that he had completed a hattrick until after we came out to bat. He is a great bowler. He had been bowling pretty well but was not being able to get the wickets. He showed his class today.         
	On the captain fielding on the boundary line         
	Well Im not the best fielder so I had to stand on the boundary line.         
	Hows your finger?         
	It s better than before but theres still loads of pain.

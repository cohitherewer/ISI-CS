	Zurich: Triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt confirmed his domination of the sprints on Friday with a comfortable 100m victory at the Weltklasse Golden League meeting.         
	The 22-year-old Jamaican, who set world records in winning the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay in Beijing, finished Fridays race in 9.83 seconds, 0.16 seconds clear of Americas double Olympic bronze medallist Walter Dix.         
	After taking silver behind Bolt at the Olympics, Trinidad amp; Tobagos Richard Thompson had to settle for third place in Zurich, a further 10th of a second behind Dix.         
	It was good, but my start was not too good, said Bolt. I concentrated on winning and as Im starting to get a cold I was not able to think about any faster time.         
	Fellow Olympic champion and world record holder Dayron Robles was also able to back up his stunning 110m hurdles performance in Beijing.         
	The 21-year-old Cuban ran neck and neck with Olympic bronze medal winner David Oliver before ducking his head at the line to finish in 12.97 seconds, 0.01 seconds ahead of the American.         
	Kenyan teenager Pamela Jelimo continued her fantastic season, following up her Olympic gold medal in the 800m by setting the years best time of 1: 54.01.         
	Jelimo, 18, kept well on track for a share of the Golden Leagues $1m jackpot awarded to athletes who win their event at all six of the seasons meetings.         
	Theres still one race to go for the jackpot and the world record is closer now, too, though Im not sure I can do it this year, she said.         
	With only next Fridays Golden League meeting in Brussels remaining, Jelimo faces competition for the main prize only from Croatian high jumper Blanka Vlasic.         
	After being denied the gold medal in Beijing by surprise Olympic champion Tia Hellebaut of Belgium, Vlasic struck back impressively in Zurich.           (REUTERS)

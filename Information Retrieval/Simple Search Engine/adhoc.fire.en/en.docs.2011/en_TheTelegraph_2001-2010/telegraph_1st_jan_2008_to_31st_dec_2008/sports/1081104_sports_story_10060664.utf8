	Bangalore: Anil Kumble on Monday said that his successor Mahendra Singh Dhoni would be a successful captain and said Indian cricket was safe under his leadership.         
	This is the right decision and now I hand over this role to Dhoni. We have a very able leader in him.         
	Team is also looking very nice and I am sure it will continue to move forward. Indian cricket is in safe hands, he said.         
	Asked about Dilip Vengsarkars criticism a day before his retirement, Kumble said he prefers not to take such statements personally and instead thanked the former chief selector for giving him an opportunity to lead the Indian Test side.         
	It is something which I dont take personally. Thats his opinion. I dont know about it, some journalists came to me and told me about what he had said. I dont read newspapers so I dont know. But thanks to Dilip, I got to be the captain of the team. I am thankful to all those who made it possible, he said.         
	On his future plans, Kumble said he was working towards opening an academy for budding cricketers.         
	There are plans to start an academy, not immediately but in a couple of months. The groundwork has already started. he said.           (PTI)

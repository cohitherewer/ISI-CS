The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hayden: We will make a comeback 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hayden: We will make a comeback 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Matthew Hayden                           
	New Delhi: Australian opener Matthew Hayden on Sunday toiled for four hours at the nets and said was ready for a big knock in the third Test against India beginning on Wednesday.         
	Hayden, generally considered the backbone of Australian batting, played miserably in the first two Tests in Bangalore and Mohali. With two games to go, I expect to play very well in those two Tests, Hayden said.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Australias preparations for the third Test         
	So far its been good. We are 0-1 down in the series because India played very well in the last game. Australia played very well in the first Test but didnt get the desired result and so we are down in the series. I had a look at the Kotla track and it does look like a good batting pitch. We will surely make a comeback.         
	His own preparations         
	Ive put in a lot of work in a month in India but it has not quite paid off. But Im very confident with the way Im playing now. A big score is round the corner... For me its a good opportunity really to spend some time in the middle. These next 13 days of cricket will shape the way we want to play the game. Todays extended net session was to replicate what I want to do in the next 13 days.         
	If he agrees that he has struggled against Zaheer Khan in the series so far         
	I think when a bowler is successful against a particular batsman he knows he has got certain strategies thats working for him. But, of course, I believe in my heart that I have been extremely successful against Zaheer before and I believe he knows it well. So its a good fight. Things might be different this time.         
	On what happened after Zaheer dismissed him in Mohali         
	After I got dismissed, Zaheer was obviously very excited and I think Chris Broad dealt with it in a way that was appropriate. I can assure you that Hayden had no role to play in that incident. We really tried to concentrate on various disciplines within our game. We are extremely optimistic of the competition ahead.         
	Having problem in dealing with reverse swing         
	Whenever we come to India, the talk is always about spin bowling. It has been so over a long period of time. But reverse swing is something Australian cricket has come across in the past. We know its a weapon in modern game with wicket playing good and hard. When I first started playing cricket there used to be greener conditions, which allowed conventional swing. Its part of the modern day game to combat reverse swing and I think our strategy is good enough to combat that.         
	Stuart Clarks fitness         
	Stuart had a good bowl today. I think its a matter of time and well assess him tomorrow.

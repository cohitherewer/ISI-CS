	Sreesanth stands by Harbhajan 
 
	Mumbai: Indian paceman Sreesanth doesnt believe that someone like Harbhajan Singh will never uses abusive language on the field. quot;I know him and he will never abuse anyone on the field, he said.
 
	He later said that even the Indians were aggressive and Australians got the taste of their own medicine when they toured India recently. They (Australians) are known for sledging and it did not go well with them when we gave it back to them. 
 
	If they couldnt take our aggression then it is not my problem, quot; he said. 
 
	Sreesanth will be travelling to the NCA in Bangalore on Thursday and said he had kept Indian physio John Gloster, Dilip Vengsarkar and NCA director of operations Dav Whatmore informed about his recovery process. 
 
	Afridi wants to be captain
 
	 Karachi: Flamboyant allrounder Shahid Afridi joined the race for the Pakistan captaincy following doubts over the availability of Shoaib Malik for the first two ODIs against Zimbabwe. It is a big honour to play for the country. But it is every players dream to captain the national side too. I am no different, Afridi said.
 
	The PCB said it was monitoring Maliks fitness in the national conditioning camp. 
 
	Saqlains dream
 
	 London: Former Pakistan off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq has said he would like to play for England once he qualifies in April. Saqlain, 31, took 208 wickets in 49 Tests for Pakistan and has played County cricket for 10 years. He possesses a British passport through marriage.
 
	Hussains belief
 
	 London: Former captain Nasser Hussain has said Englands batsmen need to come out of their comfort zone and follow teammate Kevin Pietersens more selfish approach if they are to regain the Ashes. 
 
	I believe England have the raw materials to build another very strong side. The area of concern for me is mental; they need toughening up, Hussain said. 
 
	Arun to stay 
 
	 Calcutta: Bharat Arun reached the city on Wednesday, saying he would stay with Bengal and prepare for the upcoming national one-dayers, adds A Staff Reporter. I plan to start by watching several league matches and make pool of 20 players and have a 14-day one-day specific camp in the first week of February, Arun said. Arun is expected to sit with the CAB officials before deciding on the future course of action.

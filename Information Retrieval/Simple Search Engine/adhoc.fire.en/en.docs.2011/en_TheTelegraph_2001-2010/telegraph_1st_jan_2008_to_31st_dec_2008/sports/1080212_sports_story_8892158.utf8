                                                   My talent is a gift from God: Chowrasia
  - I wish to know the secret of not losing focus from Woods, says champion       INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                            
	Calcutta: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia had a busy day on arrival in the city on Monday morning. Despite numerous commitments, he found time to speak to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts  
	On whether his success will help promote the sport  
	I hope so. We need two or three more courses in Calcutta for the game to spread to the masses. The Indian Tour should also have more money. But the youngsters these days are very professional. They take to the game in an organised manner. They are bound to achieve success. I never did physical training till the last six months. I have been training with my friend Pritam Saikia, who is based in Delhi. He accompanies me on the Asian Tour and when Im in the country I remain in regular touch. It has helped improve my game.  
	On how he celebrated the victory  
	I did not do much because by the time I finished my media commitments, it was late. I was also tired hellip; Had a quiet dinner with my brother and a few friends hellip; May be we will have a celebration now that Im in back here.  
	On whether the achievement has sunk in   
	On Sunday I was confused hellip; I didnt realise the significance and things happened so fast. After going through the papers on Monday, its now sort of sinking in hellip; I know the weight of expectations is bound to increase hellip; I decided not to play in Indonesia because it would be tough to focus hellip; I need to cool down and relax.  
	On whether success has also brought in sponsors  
	There has been nothing very significant yet, but industrialist Gautam Thapar has decided to sponsor me on the European Tour. The Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) is also there with me. So I dont have to worry.  
	On if he has a role model   
	I dont idolise anyone. When I used to practice, there would be no one around because I had my sessions when everyone left.   
	On if he follows anyone with special interest  
	Tiger Woods. During the Masters, I followed Ernie Els very closely. In fact, they are among the greats of the game. Only yesterday Rahil Gangjee and I were discussing that Els enjoyed a big advantage because of his height. He lost to Woods very closely in the Desert Classic recently. Els has a good swing. He is affable and has a great attitude.  
	On whether he has spoken to any of the Indians on the circuit  
	I am in constant touch with Jeev Milkha Singh, Jyoti Randhawa, Shiv Kapur and Arjun Atwal mdash; Indias representatives on the European Tour. I was with Jyoti at the airport this morning and sought his advice on playing in Europe. He is always forthcoming and has promised all possible help and guidance.  
	On his forthcoming tournaments  
	I will be playing in the SAIL Open in Greater Noida (beginning February 20) to be followed by the Johnny Walker Classic at the DLF course.  
	On taking to the sport as a pro  
	The love of golf attracted me and the monetary factor was an added incentive. I went to Patna to participate in a tournament in 1997 with my pocket money. I played with Mukesh Kumar. I got some money there, but more importantly, gained confidence. Things started to fall in place after I came second at the Indian Open in 1999.   
	On if he has received any formal coaching  
	Nothing in my formative years. I got my first coaching in 1999 from Australian Clive Bird. He worked on my swing and corrected my posture. He also changed my grip slightly. Everything comes naturally to me hellip; Ive learnt a lot from watching others. My talent is a gift from God.  
	On his interest in other sports  
	Table tennis and tennis hellip; I want to play tennis for relaxation and not cricket or football because of the chances of getting injured in those games. Sourav Ganguly is my favourite cricketer. I also like Ronaldinho, particularly because he always has a smile.  
	On his nickname Chipputtsia  
	(Smiles) I want to get rid of it. My game is more that just chip and putt now. I am hitting better. The other day Atwal also said that they should stop calling me by that name.  
	On his shortcomings  
	I have to improve my fitness and strength. My putting has improved but I need to be consistent. I have to overcome these before setting foot in Europe. I also plan to do yoga and meditation to improve concentration.  
	On his target  
	I want to play well in the European Tour and make it to the USPGA. I will be playing in the HSBC Championship in Shanghai later this year where Woods will also participate. I want to speak to him and know the secret of not losing focus in the final round. This is because Ive lost numerous tournaments in the final round.  
	On whether he wants to dedicate this achievement to anyone  
	To Neel Low, who gave me my first set of clubs, to RCGC and its members without whose support nothing would have been possible.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sporting return to I-League elite tier
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Md. Sporting return to I-League elite tier
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mike Okoro scored the equaliser against United SC in 1-1 draw                           
	Guwahati: Mohammedan Sporting confirmed their berth in the top tier of the I-League after a 1-1 draw with Chirag United SC in a penultimate round match of the second division finals on Wednesday. Theodore Sundey Wrobeh scored for United in the 46th minute before Mohammedan Sporting captain Mike Okoro equalised in the 57th.         
	Mohammedans Adebayo Tokonbo missed a penalty in the dying minutes of the match. With seven points, Mohammedan Sporting joined Chirag United (10 points) and Mumbai FC (7) in the first division.         
	Mohammedan Sporting thus managed to put an end to Uniteds winning streak. After a barren first half in the all-Calcutta fixture, Sundey Wrobeh drew first blood for Chirag United two minutes into the second half.         
	After conceding the goal, Mohammedan Sporting came back strongly to repeatedly attack the opponents territory, and reaped the harvest 10 minutes later with Okoro scoring the equaliser.         
	Okoro pushed in a shot from teammate Kulothangan to get past Chirag custodian Somnath Khara. The ball slowed down in front of the goalpost only to be pushed in by Okoro for the equaliser.         
	Mohammedan Sporting got another opportunity in the dying minutes of the match when they were awarded a penalty after Mozaffar Rahman of Chirag pulled down forward Kulothangan inside the box. However, Adebayo squandered the opportunity as his shot went straight into the safe hands of the Chirag custodian.

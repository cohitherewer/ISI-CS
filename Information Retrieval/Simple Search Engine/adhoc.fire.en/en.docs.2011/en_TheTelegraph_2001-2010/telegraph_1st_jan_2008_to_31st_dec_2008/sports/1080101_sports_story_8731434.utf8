                                                     Were looking ahead, not back: Zaheer

        Brad Hogg
   
	Team India spearhead Zaheer Khan and the sole specialist spinner in the Australia squad, Brad Hogg, spoke to the media in Sydney on Monday afternoon.
 
	The following are excerpts
 
	HOGG: The MCG Test was my first in four years and I was nervous... It was good nervousness... The nerves, though, settled down... Now, Ill take to the second Test with confidence and will probably be getting a bit more respect from the Indians... At the end of the day, I can only give one hundred per cent... Im bowling to the best players of spin and, so, its a challenge and we know the Indians will come hard at us... I did enjoy getting Sourav Ganguly at the MCG... Hed been my first Test victim too (back at the Kotla in October 1996)... The wicket at the SCG seems to have changed a little in the past couple of years and the spinners probably have to work harder... I dont think Im going anywhere near Shane Warnes shoes... Im a different type of bowler and person... Im quite impatient and need to work on that... Thats my character and I cant change... I realise there are few left-arm chinaman bowlers... I myself grew up seeing Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson bowl... Now, hopefully, there are some young left-arm chinaman bowlers... I dont think age is a factor in international sport and sportsmen can go on till 40-45... The good thing about the Australian team is that everybody backs everybody... We help each other.

	ZAHEER: Were looking ahead, not back... I wouldnt like to talk of the last Test... Thats gone... Its not that the bowling unit is disappointed with the batsmen... Its a team game and ones in it together... Instead of looking back, we should look at the 15 days of cricket left in this Test series... Its not that Im missing a (quality) new-ball bowler at the other end... Its all about creating pressure and any bowler can do that... Yes, I did have a problem with the no-balls at the MCG... It will be sorted out before the second Test... I havent taken a different approach in Australia, its just that one needs time to adjust... Rahul Dravids a great player and will surely bounce back.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Krejza should play 3rd Test, says Border
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Krejza should play 3rd Test, says Border
                      
	Melbourne: Dismissing suggestions to call up Andrew Symonds and Shaun Tait or the retired Shane Warne to save Australia the blushes, former skipper Allan Border on Saturday batted for rookie spinner Jason Krejza to be included in the first XI for the third Test against India.         
	Theyve got to look at the spin option, that seems obvious. Thats an area that is an Achilles heel, Border was quoted as saying .         
	Cameron White and Michael Clarke have done well, but theyre not front-line spinners. Theyve taken Jason away, so we need to find out one way or the other whether hes the right bloke, he said.         
	I know he got unflattering figures in the tour game but that counts for nothing. If youve taken him away, theres a reason for that and now is the moment of truth. Theyve just got to have the guts to play him  and I think they need to, added the former Australia captain, who was a national selector for seven years till 2005.         
	Krejza has been cooling his heels on the bench after he was ignored for the first two Tests. But Border feels if Ricky Pontings men desire to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Krejza should be given a go in Delhi.

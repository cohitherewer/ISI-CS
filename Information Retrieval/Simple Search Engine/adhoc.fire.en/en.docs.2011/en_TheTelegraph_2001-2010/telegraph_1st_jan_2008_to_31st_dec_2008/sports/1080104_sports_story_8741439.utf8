                                                   A counter-attack with few parallels

 - Laxmans gem leaves Aussies clueless 
   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
                 
	Sydney: Asked whether counter-attacking would be the best strategy in Australia, V.V.S. Laxman had replied depends on the situation. 
    
	That was in the lead-up to the first Test, at the MCG, where Team India got mauled. 
    
	On Thursday afternoon, the situation presented itself at the SCG and Laxman counter-attacked like few, in recent memory, have dared to do. 
    
	Most of Laxmans runs came through drives and, within a matter of overs, the aggressive Australians switched to being defensive. 
    
	So fluent was Laxmans batting that few noticed just how much Rahul Dravid was struggling. They came together very early in the innings, after Wasim Jaffer was bowled by a low full toss from Brett Lee. 
    
	Jaffer, by the way, has cut a sorry figure in all three innings so far. 
    
	The former captain did produce a half-century, and it couldnt have been timed better even if his timing didnt send anybody into raptures, but its Laxmans 109 (218 minutes, 142 balls, 18x4) which will be talked about for years. 
    
	I rate it as one of the finest by any Indian overseas... Laxman, in my opinion, was all class... That it would be such a high quality innings became evident within minutes, former India captain and cricket manager Ravi Shastri told The Telegraph. 
    
	Shastri, incidentally, has a double century at the SCG. 
    
	Thanks to Laxman and his 175-run partnership with Dravid for the second wicket, the Indians could reach 216 for three at stumps on Day II of the second 3mobile Test. 
    
	Anil Kumble and his men are still way behind Australias first innings 463, but with Sachin Tendulkar (who got a standing ovation when he came out) and Sourav Ganguly around, the Test is actually quite interestingly poised. 
    
	Earlier, the Australians batted till about 20 minutes before lunch. Andrew Symonds remained not out on 162 and Lee managed to reach 59. My dream is to get a Test century, he revealed. 
    
	The Test is balanced well, said Laxman, while Lee accepted that the wickets of Dravid and Laxman late in the day helped spare Australia a restless night. 
    
	Those late wickets were important... Laxman was batting beautifully, but the Australian way is to hang in there... It wouldve been a different story had we only taken one wicket, Lee maintained. 
    
	Now, of course, Laxman has a hundred in each of his three Test appearances at the SCG. The latest wasnt without blemish  Adam Gilchrist, who is one short of 400 victims, dropped him twice  but he deserved every stroke of luck. 
    
	The dasher from Hyderabad, after all, himself produced strokes by the dozen. Forget the bowlers and fielders looking nonplussed, even captain Ricky Ponting often didnt know what to do. 
    
	Kya zabardaast batting ki hai... All of us enjoyed every minute, praised manager (and former opener) Chetan Chauhan. 
    
	There was praise too for the dour Dravid, who took 45 minutes and 40 deliveries to move from 18 to 19. He was, in fact, unfazed by the barracking and raised his bat in acknowledgment when the turnout cheered that 19th run. 
    
	Dravid also had two lives. 
    
	Significantly, even as the Symonds confession continues to cause ripples, Ponting didnt claim a catch off Dravid when the batsman was just short of his half-century. 
    
	One hopes thats the starting point for honesty across all teams. Equally, one hopes there will be accountability for the likes of Steve Bucknor, who (for all his experience) continued with poor decision-making.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly believes that Bengal cricket will benefit from Mohinder Amarnath, who took charge as consultant of the Bengal senior team on Monday.         
	Speaking to reporters after a strenuous four-hour long training session under the watchful eyes of the former Indian allrounder on Tuesday, Sourav said: He was a great cricketer. One of the best during his time And theres a lot to learn from him I feel juniors will gain immensely from him ... Bengal cricket will improve too.         
	Sourav however, declined to comment on his availability for Bengals Ranji Plate Division campaign starting in November. I am not in a position to comment anything on it... There have been no talks with the CAB yet... the administration is going to look after it.         
	Incidentally, this was Souravs first meeting with Amarnath.         
	The 57-year old Amarnath was learnt to have given special tips to Sourav during Tuesdays training. Amarnath, however, chose to play it down. There was no special session with Sourav. It was a regular session and thats all... We spoke a lot on cricket, Amarnath said.         
	Asked whether he would like Sourav to be included in the Bengal squad, Amarnath said: Obviously, his inclusion will help us a lot But its not my duty to speak to him regarding this. Its the CABs job.         
	Amarnath, after the first-days training session was quite satisfied with the fitness level of the players.         
	It was learnt that the CAB after a meeting with Amarnath on Tuesday evening have restructured the Challengers meet. The matches will now be three-dayers.The consultant has also stressed on the need to have a specialist leg-spinner in the squad.

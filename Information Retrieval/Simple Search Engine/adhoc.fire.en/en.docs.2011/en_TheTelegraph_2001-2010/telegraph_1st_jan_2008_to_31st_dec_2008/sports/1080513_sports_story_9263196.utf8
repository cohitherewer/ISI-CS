                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lifter Kavita banned for doping
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Another doping controversy has struck Indian weightlifting with promising lifter Kavita Devi being banned for two years after failing a drugs test.         
	According to Weightlifting Federation of India (WFI) sources, Kavita, who was a member of the Indian team in the recent Asian championships in Kanazawa City, Japan, was sent back midway through the meet after she tested positive.         
	The WFI president, Harbhajan Singh, said the 75-kg lifter was excluded from the squad because she tested positive for steroid use.         
	We received the information late. When we came to know about it, we asked her to return from Japan, Singh said. She was not inclined to take the B sample test, the WFI chief added.         
	Singh said Kavita, who trains at the SAI Centre of Excellence in Lucknow, has been told by the International Weightlifting Federation that she will not be able to participate in any international or national competitions for two years.         
	Indias Egyptian coach Magad Salama quit last February alleging that several of Indias top lifters were taking performance-enhancing drugs.         
	WFI officials challenged the Egyptians claim but Salama did not relent and finally left the job.

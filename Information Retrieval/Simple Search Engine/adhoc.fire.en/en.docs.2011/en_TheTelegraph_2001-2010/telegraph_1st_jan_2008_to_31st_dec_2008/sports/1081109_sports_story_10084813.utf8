The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff banking on experience
                                                                                                                                                                                           Flintoff banking on experience
                      
	Mumbai: Fit and raring to go after missing nearly a year of international cricket due to injuries, England allrounder Andrew Flintoff on Saturday said he is counting on his past experience of playing in India to help his team upstage Mahendra Singh Dhonis side in the seven-match ODI series starting November 14.         
	I will be trying to pass on whatever I know and help other people in the team with my experience. The important thing is for everyone to enjoy the Indian culture while they are here, Flintoff said.         
	The lanky allrounder, who was out for about a year due to a nagging ankle injury before returning to international cricket this year, said the big test for the English team would be the Indian conditions and adapting to them.         
	I have been trying to get lighter on my feet while batting, Flintoff said.         
	Denying there would be any extra pressure on him to perform during the seven ODI series and two Tests, he said, When I go out to bat I just want to score runs.         
	Playing in India is always interesting as people were more passionate about the game and the stadiums are packed with spectators, Flintoff said.         
	Flintoff said it was regrettable that Sachin Tendulkar would be absent for the first three ODIs and only a few of the senior players like Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble would be there in the upcoming tour.         
	Meanwhile, pacer Ryan Sidebottom has said he may miss the first few matches of the seven-match one-day series as he has not completely recovered from his calf injury.         
	The England team will start their tour of India with a warm-up match at the Brabourne Stadium against a Mumbai XI starting Sunday. (PTI)

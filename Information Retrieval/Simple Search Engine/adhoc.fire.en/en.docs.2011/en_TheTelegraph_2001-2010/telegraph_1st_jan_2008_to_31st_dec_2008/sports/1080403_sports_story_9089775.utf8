                                                   Shoaib: I was approached by bookies
                      
	Karachi: In a sensational revelation, banned Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar on Wednesday said he was approached by match fixers during the tours of India and South Africa.         
	I have rejected many offers to under-perform. It happened in Johannesburg and India but I never accepted them as I cant betray my country, he said in a interview to a local TV channel.         
	And what do I get in return A five-year ban, the example of which you dont get anywhere in the cricketing world, Shoaib said.         
	Shoaib, who will play for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, said he had been signed up on the insistence of Sourav Ganguly.         
	If I had been so indisciplined, do you think that Shah Rukh Khan or Ganguly would want me to play for their team, he stated. (PTI)

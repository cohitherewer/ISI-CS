	Bangalore: Asserting his supremacy, Pankaj Advani on Friday annexed the ONGC IBSF World Billiards Championship (point format) with a comprehensive six games to one victory over Geet Sethi.         
	The 23-year-old Bangalorean delighted the home crowd at Karnataka State Billiards Association hall with a superlative display, winning 150-90, 151-0, 150-24, 150-0, 86-150, 150-72, 150-12.         
	After a below-par semi final match on Thursday, Advani played with far more focus and swept the first four games in the morning session to gain a position of strength.         
	Though the veteran Sethi, with eight world billiards titles under his belt, won the first game in the next session, he could not get the momentum going, with his younger opponent dominating proceedings.         
	Advani said the bad semi-final had spurred him to come out with improved performance and it paid off.         
	In sport, every day is a new day, he said after the match which promised to be an epic encounter before the start but turned out to be one-sided in the end.         
	He said every day throws up new challenges and its different from the previous day.         
	Sethi said inclusion of billiards in the Asian Games inspired him to continue playing the game and expressed hope that it would figure in the Olympics as well.         
	I am still going strong, I still enjoy the game, he added.         
	Meanwhile, the time format of the ONGC IBSF World Billiards Championship gets underway here from Saturday. The final will be played on Wednesday. (PTI)

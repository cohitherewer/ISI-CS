The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rebels fall in line, for now 
                                                   Rebels fall in line, for now 
            DAVIC CUP TIE vs JAPAN                          Leander Paes      
	Bangalore: Indias Davis Cuppers, who have revolted against captain Leander Paes, on Sunday agreed to play under him but only for the upcoming tie against Japan in New Delhi next month.         
	The players  Prakash Amritraj, Rohan Bopanna and Mahesh Bhupathi  said, via a statement, that their stand on Paes captaincy had not changed but they were making themselves available for the Japan tie as playing for the country was of paramount importance.         
	Former Davis Cup captain Vijay Amritraj read out the statement on behalf of the players after the conclusion of the WTA Bangalore Open here.         
	Playing for the country is of paramount importance and there is no greater honour With our only goal being to play for the country and with all other issues very much on the table we look forward to playing the Japan tie at home in April. And, just to reiterate, our first letter to AITA stands, the statement said.         
	The players added that they had discussed the issue with Vijay before making themselves available.         
	It (the letter written to the AITA) was done after a lot of thought and with a heavy heart. We have had numerous conversations with Indias most respected sports ambassador who served the country for over two decades with distinction.         
	Vijay, who had been authorised by players to speak on their behalf, said: The boys decision is unanimous.         
	There is no going back. The issues needed to be addressed I was really concerned and I had long discussions with them. I had a series of discussions with Mahesh, Prakash and Rohan.         
	Vijay said that though the players had agreed to play under Paes, the decision to remain in the hot seat or not was his to make.         
	As for the Japan match, the players have said that they are prepared to play under him. It is left to him to sit on the chair.           (PTI)

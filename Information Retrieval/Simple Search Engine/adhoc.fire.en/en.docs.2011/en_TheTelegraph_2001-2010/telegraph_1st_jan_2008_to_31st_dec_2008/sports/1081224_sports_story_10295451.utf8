The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rahane not losing focus
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rahane not losing focus

	Mumbai: Twenty-year-old Ajinkya Rahane of Mumbai, who has emerged as the surprise leading run-getter in the Ranji Trophy midway through the season, says he wouldnt be satisfied until he has achieved his prime goal of making it to the Indian team.         
	My dream is to play for India and I want to be focused on that. I am not thinking about what others are doing. I want to keep contributing, performing for my team, Rahane told The Telegraph.         
	At the start of the season, Rahane wasnt exactly making headlines. That task was left to the likes of Cheteshwar Pujara who slammed three consecutive triple centuries, not all of them in first-class cricket though. Rahane, however, has gone about his task with a single-mindedness to clinch the batting honours at the end of the league stage.         
	His 924 runs at an astonishing average of 84.00 have come at a strike rate of 69.84 this season. His tally so far includes four hundreds .         
	His consistency is remarkable considering that this is only his second season. Even last year, on debut, he aggregated more than 1000 runs from seven matches in first-class cricket overall. I worked hard on my technique in the off-season. My natural game is a positive one and that helps, said Rahane.         
	Another aspect of his batting is that whenever he gets to the triple figure, he goes on to make a big one. It was evident even in his under-19 days. On Indias U-19 tour of New Zealand, Rahane made 179 while sharing a 291-run partnership with Tanmay Srivastava in the last of three Tests. The duo were then involved in another century stand, scoring 110 each, that helped India win the one-day series, that followed, 2-1.         
	Mumbai coach Pravin Amre, however, values his hundreds against Delhi and Gujarat more. His hundreds are important because they come in the first innings, he said.         
	Amre believes Rahane is an India material and its a matter of making the necessary adjustments.

	Nagpur: An inexplicable collapse by the Indian lower order combined with a fluent unbeaten 92 from Simon Katich helped Australia fight back in the fourth and final Test on Friday.         
	Debutant Jason Krejza did the star turn with eight for 215 and then Katichs 115-run partnership with Michael Hussey (batting on 45) kept them in the reckoning at close on the second day. In between, Harbhajan Singh scalped his 300th wicket when he dismissed Ricky Ponting.         
	The Indians, sailing smoothly at 422 for five at one stage, seemed to develop a sudden bout of lunacy as they lost wickets in a flurry to be bowled out for 441 at the Jamatha Stadium. The Aussies consolidated their position by racing to 189 for two.         
	Krejza repaid his captains faith in him with a deadly spell in the post-lunch session during which he took five wickets from 26 balls, conceding just 15 runs.         
	His figures are the best by a visiting spinner on Indian soil and made him only the fourth bowler in the history of the game to claim eight wickets in his maiden innings.         
	Considering that Shane Warne, who too made his debut against India, returned with a haul of one for 168 in his first innings and went 22 innings without a fiver against India, it augurs well for the 25-year-old off-spinner.         
	Krejza received enormous help from the home batsmen. After not losing a wicket in the morning session, the hosts crashed within an hour after lunch.         
	Krejza struck with the fourth ball of the fourth over on resumption when Dhoni played far too across and exposed his leg stump.         
	Two balls later, Krejza got the outside edge of Sourav Gangulys bat with one that turned. The ball also had enough bounce to surprise the batsman and Michael Clarke took a good low catch at first slip.         
	The offie then removed Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra off successive balls. Ishant Sharma averted the hattrick but didnt last long. Ishant finally became Krejzas fifth victim of the day with a catch to Katich at short leg.         
	There was little sign of things to come in the first session when Sourav and Dhoni negotiated the Australian bowling with ease.         
	It was Dhoni who got the scoreboard moving with his nonchalant punches through the off-side but soon Sourav took control. The former India captain once again showed his class as he regularly beat the point and cover fielders to the boundary.         
	The left-hander reached his 35th Test fifty with a flourishing cover drive off Krejza. He seemed to be on his way to joining a select band of batsmen  Australians Reginald Duff, Bill Ponsford, Greg Chappell and Mohammed Azharuddin  who scored centuries in their debut Test as well as the last one, but that was not to be, for the time being at least.         
	Sourav went into the lunch break on 80, but could add only five more to his account afterwards before falling to Krejza.         
	Harbhajan became only the third Indian to claim 300 wickets with his dismissal of Ponting  it was the tenth time the Aussie captain fell to the Turbanator in his career  but there was little else to celebrate for the hosts.         
	Dhoni juggled the new ball between Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan (who bowled the second over of the innings) and Ishant Sharma without much success.         
	Matthew Hayden had fallen in the seventh over, thanks to some inspired fielding by Murali Vijay Krishna whose direct hit from mid-on caught the batsman yards short of the crease.

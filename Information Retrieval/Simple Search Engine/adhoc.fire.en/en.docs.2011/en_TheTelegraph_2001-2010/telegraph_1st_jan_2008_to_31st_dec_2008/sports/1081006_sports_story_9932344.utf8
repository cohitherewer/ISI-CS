The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes, Dlouhy falter in final
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Paes, Dlouhy falter in final
                      
	New Delhi: Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhys bid for a second successive ATP title ended in disappointment after the top seeds were stunned by the Russian-German pair of Mikhail Youzhny and Mischa Zverev in the finals of AIG Japan Open in Tokyo on Sunday.         
	The unseeded Youzhny and Zverev beat the Indo-Czech pair 6-3, 6-4 to capture their second ATP title together.         
	Playing a solid service game, Youzhny and Zverev converted two of the four break points that came their way and protected their serve against four break point chances that Dlouhy and Paes earned in the 58-minute encounter.         
	It is the second time this year that Youzhny and Zverev have combined to deny Paes and Dlouhy a title win, having also done so when they claimed their maiden ATP title at Halle in June.         
	Paes and Dlouhy were chasing their second straight title after capturing their first last week at Bangkok.         
	The 35-year-old Paes was bidding for his 41st ATP doubles title and second in Tokyo, after triumphing in 2000 with former partner Mahesh Bhupathi.         
	In singles, Czech Tomas Berdych halted fifth seed Juan Martin del Potros hot streak by beating the Argentine 6-1, 6-4 to win the Japan Open on Sunday.         
	Ninth seed Berdychs fourth ATP Tour title and his first since winning on grass in Halle last year came after Del Potro left the court to take medicine for an upset stomach.         
	Everyone could see he had some problem, said Berdych, who stunned second seed Andy Roddick in the semi-finals.         
	But he took some pills and was getting back into the match.         
	It might have been different if Juan Martin was feeling better but I served well and everything came together.         
	Del Potro had been strong favourite to win the final at the $969,000 Tokyo hardcourt tournament having won 29 of his previous 30 matches but Berdych dominated from the start.

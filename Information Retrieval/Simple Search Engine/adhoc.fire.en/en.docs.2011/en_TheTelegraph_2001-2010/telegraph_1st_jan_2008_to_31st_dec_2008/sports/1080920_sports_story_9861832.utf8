The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | US grab early advantage
                                                                                                                                                                                             US grab early advantage
                  Nick Faldo takes notes on the opening day                     
	Louisville: The United States won the opening Ryder Cup session for the first time in 17 years to lead holders Europe by three points to one after Fridays foursome matches at Valhalla Golf Club.         
	Despite trailing early on in all four alternate shot encounters, Paul Azingers Americans mounted a gritty fightback in bright sunshine in their bid to end a run of three successive defeats in the biennial competition.         
	The US had not won an opening session since the 1991 matches at Kiawah Island.         
	Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan drew first blood with a 3 and 2 victory over Britains Paul Casey and Swede Henrik Stenson in the second match out after recovering from a bogey-bogey start.         
	It feels great, Leonard said in a greenside interview after he and Mahan sealed the win with a regulation par on the 16th green.         
	I told Hunter I lost the first two holes for us on purpose to take the pressure off. We had a lot of fun out there and were looking forward to this afternoon.         
	Stewart Cink and Chad Campbell came from one down after 12 holes to edge British pairing Ian Poulter and rookie Justin Rose one up after their opponents three-putted 18.         
	We didnt play perfect but we recovered from our mistakes, made a couple of birdies and picked our way out of it, Cink said.         
	In a topsy-turvy battle in the top match, Phil Mickelson and rookie Anthony Kim recovered from three down with six holes remaining to finish all square with Irishman Padraig Harrington and Swede Robert Karlsson.         
	The Americans won three consecutive holes from the 13th and had a chance to clinch victory at the last before Kim failed to escape from a greenside bunker.         
	I thought we might have a chance on 17 and 18 but unfortunately we didnt make a birdie, said Mickelson, who is appearing in his seventh Ryder Cup. We were very grateful to take a half having been three down with six to go.         
	Local favourite Kenny Perry and Jim Furyk came from one down to lead Spaniard Sergio Garcia and Britains Lee Westwood by two with two to play before having to settle for a half.         
	Kentucky native Perry missed a four-foot par putt on 17 for the win and drove into water at the last to let the Europeans back into the match.         
	It was just a battle out there, a disappointed Perry said. We fought hard and played great. Thats just the way it goes. We had our shot.         
	Garcia, an inspirational figure for Europe since his Cup debut in 1999, extended his unbeaten record in foursomes matches to 8-0-1 (win-loss-half).         
	Europe are bidding for an unprecedented fourth consecutive victory while the United States are seeking their first triumph since their come-from-behind success at Brookline in 1999.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No dearth of talent in Bengal, says Mohinder Amarnath
                                                                                                                                                                                                       No dearth of talent in Bengal, says Mohinder Amarnath
    - IM VERY HOPEFUL SOURAV WILL BE IN THE TEST TEAM AGAINST AUSTRALIA             A STAFF REPORTER            Mohinder Amarnath with Laxmi Ratan Shukla at the Pankaj Gupta Indoor Coaching Centre on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                       
	Calcutta: Mohinder Amarnath, consultant to the Bengal Ranji Trophy team, arrived in the city on Monday on what can be described as a tour of introduction to and assessment of the team and the infrastructure. Amarnath reached Eden Gardens in the evening and headed straight to the indoor gym where the Bengal players were going through the paces.         
	Sourav Ganguly was there too, but he missed Amarnath by a whisker; the former India captain leaving minutes before Amarnaths arrival.         
	After his brief interaction with the players, he addressed a news conference where he spoke about the job at hand. A member of the World Cup winning team in 1983, he was characteristically optimistic about Bengals chances of a return to the Elite division. Bengal have good cricketers. The present breed is ambitious and Im sure theyll do well. They are talented... Ill share my experience with them, and try to spend as much time as I can away from my other commitments.         
	The discussion then turned to the inevitable  Sourav and his exclusion from the Rest of India team for the Irani Trophy. The Comeback Man, as he was often referred to during his playing days, said that it was still early to write off Indias most successful Test captain. When asked whether he considered Sourav capable of making a return to the Test side he shot back saying: Why do you say he wont? The teams not been announced yet. He added that Sourav has seen enough and there is nothing new he could tell the embattled southpaw. Sourav doesnt need advise. Hes seen ups and downs. Hes a focused player and a determined man. Im very hopeful hell be in the team.         
	Talking of the team proper, he conceded that perhaps Bengal have fallen on hard times, but that is all in the game. Bengal have the raw material of talent to regain their lost stature and splendour. He went on to put the entire youth versus experience debate into perspective by saying that it bespeaks folly to take sides in this great divide, the current preoccupation of all teams.         
	He agreed that youth has its vigour and passion, but qualified this by saying that it is truer of the limited-overs game than of Test cricket. You need a blend of youngsters and senior players. Age doesnt make a difference if you are physically fit and perform well. Yes, but you should look ahead and constantly seek to improve.         
	On whether he had any foreign player in mind for the Bengal team, he replied that home-grown talent that has been nurtured well negates the need for foreign signings. Ive no names in mind, honestly. If you have your own talent you dont need foreign players. Im sure Bengal has enough talent.         
	 On the question of selections and meeting the selectors he said that he would rather first meet the team, interact with the players, understand their strengths and weaknesses before coming to any conclusion.         
	On Jagmohan Dalmiya he said: I have the greatest regard for Dalmiya and when he contacted me I said yes. He has done a lot for the game. To be very honest if Im here its because of Dalmiya.

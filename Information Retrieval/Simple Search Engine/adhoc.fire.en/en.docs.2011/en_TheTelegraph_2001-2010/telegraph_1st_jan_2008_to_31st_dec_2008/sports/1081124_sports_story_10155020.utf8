            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary, Alberto Colaco is unlikely to continue in his position after December.         
	According to highly placed sources in the AIFF, Colaco on Saturday has written a letter to the new president-in-charge, Praful Patel, requesting to be relieved of his responsibilities at the end of this year.         
	Colaco, who was appointed the general secretary by Priya Ranjan Das Munshi in 2005, has a contract with the federation till December 31, 2008.         
	The new committee, which will take over after the AIFF elections on December 23, is expected to decide about the renewal of his contract.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Colaco, who left for Shanghai on Sunday to attend the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) meeting, said he was not ready to discuss the issue.         
	Let me tell you very categorically that I have not resigned, Colaco said. In that case, I would not have gone for the AFC meeting.         
	Colaco, however, admitted that he had written a letter to Patel, who has taken over the charge of the federation because of Das Munshis illness. No one knows the content of the letter except me and Mr. Patel, he said.         
	Colaco denied that he was unhappy with the conduct of some of the members. I am 60 years old. I always thought it was a good age to retire, quot; he said.         
	But I know if I leave the federation right now, it will create a vacuum. There are so many AIFF projects going on at the moment and no one understands them better than me.         
	Some AIFF insiders, however, said that his resignation could be a part of the AIFF politics to gain control over the federation in the elections to be held next month.         
	Albert (Colaco) is extremely disturbed by the attitude of some of the members, said a source close to the general secretary.         
	A few others, however, felt that Colaco was only trying to put pressure on the new president-in-charge. It is only a ploy to strengthen his own position in the AIFF, said a member.         
	Colaco, who is from Goa, shot into prominence in the mid-nineties when he was appointed the chairman of the National Football League (now I-League). In 2000, he was elected the honorary secretary.         
	Considered a close confidant of Das Munshi, Colaco has often been accused of working in an authoritarian manner. In Saturdays meeting, he spoke in favour of postponing the elections till February next but his views were opposed by a large section of the executive committee members.         
	As per the AIFF constitution, the general secretary is appointed by the executive committee on the proposal of the president.

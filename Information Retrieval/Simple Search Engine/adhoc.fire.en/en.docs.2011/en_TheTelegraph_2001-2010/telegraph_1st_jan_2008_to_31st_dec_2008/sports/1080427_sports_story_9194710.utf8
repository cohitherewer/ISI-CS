The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Troubled Mumbai Indians take on Deccan Chargers today
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Troubled Mumbai Indians take on Deccan Chargers today
                      
	Mumbai: With stand-in captain Harbhajan Singh in fresh controversy and a big question mark still on Sachin Tendulkars availability, winless Mumbai Indians will be under tremendous pressure against Deccan Chargers of Hyderabad in their Indian Premier League encounter here on Sunday.         
	In batting, the Mumbai top-order led by Sanath Jayasuriya has failed to fire and this has put enormous pressure on the teams bottom half.         
	With Deccan Chargers also losing their three outings, both teams would be eager to kick-start their tepid campaign under lights at the state-of-the-art stadium in the satellite township of Navi Mumbai, just across the harbour.         
	Hyderabad are struggling to gel as a team with retired Australian great Adam Gilchrist yet to provide value for money. V.V.S. Laxman has also not yet shown that the national selectors were wrong in repeatedly ignoring his claims in the shorter forms of the game.

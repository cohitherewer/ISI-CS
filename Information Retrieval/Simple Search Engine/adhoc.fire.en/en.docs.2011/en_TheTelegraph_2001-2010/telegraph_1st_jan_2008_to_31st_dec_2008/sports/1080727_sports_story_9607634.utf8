	ANECDOTES         
	Profit         
	For the first time the Games was organised by a private company whose stated aim was to make a profit. They eventually made $150 million.         
	Smog         
	Pollution was one of the scourges of the Games  with 12,000 tonnes of harmful emissions drifting in Los Angeles every day. In order to curb this during the Games, the city authorities asked surrounding factories to reduce production by up to 20 per cent.         
	Security         
	The spectre of terrorism led the organising committee to take drastic measures at the Games, with a record budget of $55 million, and a total of 17,000 men as well as 80 helicopters flying in the sky above Los Angeles. The authorities even considered using an explosive-disarming robot if a bomb scenario became apparent.               
	EXPLOIT         
	The Los Angeles Games belonged to one man  Carl Lewis. After a total of 2 minutes and 26 seconds of competition in the Coliseum, the American athlete achieved what, for many, was a mere formality in becoming a sporting and Olympic legend.         
	In doing so, 23-year-old Lewis equalled the impressive record set by his illustrious compatriot, Jesse Owens, in 1936 in Berlin  namely winning four gold medals in the same events during a single Olympiad: 100m and 200m double, 4x100m relay, and the long jump.         
	SUMMARY         
	In his home state of California King Carl won gold in the 100m sprint, 200m, 4x100m and the long-jump and was to remain in top level athletics until Atlanta 1996 where his fourth straight long-jump gold gave him a career haul of nine titles at four Olympiads.         
	However, in response to the 1980 boycotts the Soviet Union responded in kind at LA and pressured many of its satellite states to do the same.         
	As a result, many events were once again deprived of the top competitors and therefore irreparably devalued.         
	In the absence of the Soviet bigwigs, Frances Pierre Quinon won javelin gold and Americas Mary Lou Retton and Japans Koji Gushiken won gymnastic titles that all had the distinct taste of chocolate if bitten into to test their authenticity.         
	Some of the great and traditional clashes between East and West were sadly missed with victories in disciplines such as basketball, volleyball, weightlifting and wrestling just too easy without the Soviets there to fight tooth and nail for the gold.         
	The Games took place in the beautifully renovated stadium first used for the highly successful 1932 edition but several athletes complained bitterly about pollution levels in the city that they claimed hindered their performances.         
	But along with Lewis some great champions did of course emerge from Los Angeles.         
	Home sprinters Evelyn Ashford (100m and 4x100m) and Valerie Brisco-Hooks (200m, 400m and 4x400 m) dominated the track for the US.         
	Britains Daley Thomson successfully defended his decathlon crown won four years earlier in Moscow.         
	Moroccos Nawal El-Moutawakil became the first African woman to win an Olympic gold with a win in the 400m hurdles.         
	Britains gentleman athlete Sebastian Coe completed the first ever back-to-back gold in the 1500m while Germanys Ulrike Meyfarth won the high jump 12 years after winning her first gold in the event at Munich.

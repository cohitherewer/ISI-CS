The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | American brilliance leaves   Faldo to face the music
                                                                                                                                                                                                     American brilliance leaves   Faldo to face the music
    - With rookies and without tiger woods, us reclaim Ryder cup             Lewine Mair in Louisville                                  
	America were outstanding  nothing less. Having headed into the last day of the 37th Ryder Cup with a 97 lead, they set the seal on their first victory since 1999 when Jim Furyk defeated the game Miguel Angel Jimenez by 2 amp; 1. I feel so sorry for Miguel but great for my team-mates, said Furyk, the quiet man of American golf.         
	Paul Azingers so-called 13th man, the crowd, went every bit as wild as you would expect at the end of one of the finest matches in history. Azinger may have called upon the spectators to cheer missed putts but that was something they never did. They revelled in the occasion and added to it.         
	Fairly or unfairly, the knives were going to come out for Nick Faldo for a singles line-up in which he saved his big guns  Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Padraig Harrington  until last.         
	As had been feared, their efforts counted for nothing when Furyk tied things up in the eighth of the 12 matches. Yet as Faldo rightly insisted, things could very easily have come down to the last putt on the last green. That was the risk we took, he shrugged. It very nearly worked out The two sides were divided by fractions this time.         
	The Americans, with a bunch of rookies and no Tiger Woods, in the aftermath of their win, were probably going to see Faldo in a kindly enough light, but one complaint they had about the man was that he had lorded it over them all week.         
	It seems like hes comparing everyone to himself, said one. He didnt show us Yanks enough respect.         
	Europe had been hoping to start their comeback with a Sergio Garcia win over Anthony Kim at the top of the singles line-up. As it was, Garcia was drubbed to the tune of 5 amp; 4. The opposition had analysed what might happen to perfection.         
	Their feeling was that if you had given the Spaniard a truth serum, he would have admitted that the one player he didnt want to face was Kim.         
	Anthony can out-Sergio Sergio in terms of getting under an opponents skin, came the suggestion from the US team room. He wont take any bull**** from him.         
	To no ones great surprise, Kim was to hand when Garcia was getting a ruling at the sixth. He wanted to check that John Paramor, the referee, was not erring on the side of kindness as he told Garcia where he could take a penalty drop.         
	Kim, who was eight under par for the 14 holes  and was heading to play a 15th when told the match was over  said that this was the finest day of his life: The most exciting day Ive ever known Were in Kentucky and were winning the Ryder Cup.         
	The next US point came from the 48-year-old Kenny Perry, who defeated Henrik Stenson by 3 amp; 2.         
	 Perry had to be tired and, when news came that he had shooting pains in his shoulders, it seemed that the young and healthy Swede might prevail. But sore shoulders or not, Perry went on slotting putts, with a 10-footer at the 13th giving the local hero a virtually unassailable three-hole lead.         
	Boo Weekley, whose Kentucky Derby-like gallop from the first tee is not something he would want to try from the first tee at Turnberry next year, played the best golf of the day to defeat Oliver Wilson.         
	And then it was down to the massive-hitting JB Holmes, who, with his 17th-hole win over Soren Hansen, set things up for Furyk.         
	The first of the European points had come from Robert Karlsson as he made Justin Leonard look thoroughly ordinary for 15 holes; the next from Justin Rose, who defeated Mickelson, a player who was never the same after the 15-footer he went to pluck from the hole at the sixth spun round the cup and stayed out to have him slipping one to the bad.         
	Then there was Paul Casey. Luckily for him, his opponent, Hunter Mahan, allowed himself to get too excited after holing a 40-footer on the 17th.         
	His drive at the last went into the water and Casey won the hole and halved the match. The sad thing is that on Saturday night, the Europeans had had their best team meeting.

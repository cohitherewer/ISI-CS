The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India Blue eye final berth
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India Blue eye final berth
                      
	Cuttack: On a high after registering a bonus point win over India Red, defending champions India Blue will look to clinch a final berth when they take on India Green in the Challenger Series for the NKP Salve Trophy at Barabati Stadium here on Saturday.         
	An authoritative 96 from India discard Robin Uthappa against India Red on Thursday meant that the Karnataka batsman is back to his grooves which will be a reason for concern for the Mohammad Kaif led India Green.         
	Allrounder Irfan Pathan was also instrumental in the win having contributed a quickfire 43 on a slow and low Barabati pitch and later the Baroda medium-pacer effected two dismissals.         
	Delhi pacer Pradeep Sangwan, playing in his first Challenger tournament, was fiery and economical in his six-over spell which earned India Blue the wicket of Piyush Chawla who was sent at No. 3 to push the run rate.         
	I had nice first match outing in Challenger. With the bonus point win, we are now favourites for the summit clash on Sunday. The pitch was slow and sometimes there was low bounce, I just have to maintain my line and length without experimenting when we take on Green tomorrow (Saturday), the Delhi bowler said.         
	The only worry for India Blue could be Yuvraj Singhs form. Just when the India Blue captain was looking set, a careless shot cost him his wicket and the Punjab batsman departed for just seven.         
	Not reading too much into his failure, Yuvraj though said, As long as our team wins, I am happy.         
	The fact that Barabati pitch is low and slow must be a good sign for local boy Pragyan Ojha who will play before his home crowd for the first time. The left-arm spinner will be a formidable pair with off-spinner Yusuf Pathan who will look to explode while batting against India Blue.

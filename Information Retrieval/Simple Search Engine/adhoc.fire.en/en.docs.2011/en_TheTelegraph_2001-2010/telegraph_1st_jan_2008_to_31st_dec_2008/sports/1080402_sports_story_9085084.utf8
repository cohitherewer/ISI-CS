The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its Bhutias call: AIFF
                                                     Its Bhutias call: AIFF
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Tuesday chose to distance itself from Bhaichung Bhutias decision not to take part in the Olympic torch relay and said it wishes the event all success.         
	In a statement, AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the India captains decision was purely an expression of his fundamental rights, totally unrelated to AIFF and the football fraternity.         
	I had chat with Bhaichung over the phone and we understand his sentiments. The AIFF welcomes the Beijing 2008 Olympic torch relay as a part of Olympic movement and we wish the Games all success, the statement read.         
	The minister said that since Bhaichung hails from Sikkim, his concern for incidents in Lhasa was natural.         
	He pointed out that on several occasions individuals had used sporting events to express themselves on critical issues.         
	The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) also made it clear that it would not persuade Bhaichung to reconsider his pull out, saying it respects his personal decision.         
	The IOA secretary general Randhir Singh said they had received Bhaichungs letter detailing his reasons to opt out of the relay.         
	Hurdler G.S. Randhawa and Flying Sikh Milkha Singh, who are among the legendary former athletes invited to take part in the April 17 relay in the national capital, said a sporting arena was not the right place to make a political statement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gilchrist wins it in style
                                                                                                                                                                                             Gilchrist wins it in style
                  Deccan Chargers opener Adam Gilchrist en route to his unbeaten 109 in Mumbai on Sunday. Gilchrist scored the fastest century in the tournament, reaching the landmark in just 42 balls                     
	Mumbai: Adam Gilchrist slammed 10 sixes and nine boundaries in a cavalier unbeaten knock of 109 to power Hyderabad Deccan Chargers to a comprehensive 10-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians and register their first win in the ongoing IPL on Sunday.         
	The left-handed Gilchrist was in splendid form and carted the bowlers all around the park to delight the capacity crowd of 55,000 at the D.Y. Patil Stadium while steering to a record-setting 42-ball 100.         
	He remained unbeaten, to hold complete sway over the home attack that looked clueless on how to stop the rampage.         
	At the other end was captain V.V.S. Laxman, with an attractive unbeaten 37 as the duo piloted their team to their first win in four ties. Deccan Chargers achieved the target of 155 without any loss in only 12 overs.           (PTI)

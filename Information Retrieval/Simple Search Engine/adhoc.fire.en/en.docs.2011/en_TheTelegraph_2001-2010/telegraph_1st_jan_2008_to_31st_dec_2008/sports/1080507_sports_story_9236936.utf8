                                                                                                                                                                                           Sree: I have not changed 
                      
	Bangalore: He may have been hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons, but Kings XI Punjab speedster Sreesanth insists he has not mellowed down despite the slapgate involving Harbhajan Singh.         
	Sreesanth denied that the slapping row, which saw Harbhajan being banned from the remainder of the Indian Premier League (IPL), had curbed his aggression.         
	No, Ive not mellowed down, Sreesanth said after the Kings XI Punjab- Bangalore Royal Challengers IPL match on Monday.         
	I dont focus on past but only focus on the present. Im only concentrating on hitting the right areas.         
	The pacer rocked Bangalore Royal Challengers on Monday claiming two wickets off successive balls in the first over of the innings, a blow the hosts could not recover from.         
	The Rahul Dravid-led Bangalore side was eventually bowled out for 126 in 19.2 overs, a target the Punjab side overwhelmed in 18.2 overs losing only four wickets.         
	Sreesanths bowling figure of 4-0-16-2 earned him the Man-of-the-Match award.           (PTI)

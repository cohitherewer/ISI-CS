                  Gautam Gambhir on way to his 86 on Wednesday                     
	New Delhi: Glenn McGrath shattered the twin myth that Twenty20 is essentially a youngsters game with an obvious bias towards batsmen as he claimed the tournaments first four-wicket haul to guide Delhi DareDevils to a 10-run win over Bangalore Royal Challengers here Wednesday.         
	Chasing 192, the Bangalore outfit came close to the target, thanks to efforts by Jacques Kallis (54 off 44 balls) and Rahul Dravid (38 off 30 balls). But it did not prove enough in the end as they ended up on 181 for five.         
	Earlier put into bat, the DareDevils rode on the 98-run second wicket stand between Gautam Gambhir (86) and Shikhar Dhawan (50) to post 191 for five.         
	The visitors sprang a surprise in their run chase by sending Praveen Kumar (6) as make-shift opener but the ploy fell flat on its face as old warhorse McGrath came up with a three-wicket burst in his first spell that had the Bangalore side in complete disarray.         
	McGrath scalped Praveen with his fifth delivery and removed Ross Taylor (29) and Wasim Jaffer in the fifth over to rock the visitors who were reeling at 48 for three.         
	McGrath returned to haunt the visitors again as he scalped Dravid to break his 87-run stand with Kallis. The Australian returned an impressive figure of 4-0-29-4.           (PTI)

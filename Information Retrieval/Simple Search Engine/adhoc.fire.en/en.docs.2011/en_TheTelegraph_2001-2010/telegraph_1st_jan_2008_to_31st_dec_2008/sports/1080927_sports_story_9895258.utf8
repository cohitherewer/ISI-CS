            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: After failing to rope in M.K. Kaushik, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) appointed ad hoc committee decided on Friday to engage a foreign coach for the national hockey team.         
	It also named former assistant coach Harendra Singh the coach in charge of the senior team till the 2010 Asian Games.         
	The ad hoc committee will be appointing a foreign coach as soon as possible, said IOA president Suresh Kalmadi at a press conference at the Olympic Bhawan.         
	We have written to the International Hockey Federation (FIH) about this. They have promised to send us three names soon. The ad hoc committee will select one of them for the national team, Kalmadi added.         
	The IOA president was not ready to accept that the IOA stood embarrassed for initially selecting Kaushik for the senior team as the veteran coach was already attached with the womens squad.         
	We had spoken with the IWHF (Indian Womens hockey Federation) officials. We also had a talk with the sports ministry. Since they wanted Kaushik for the womens team, we decided to look for another coach. After all, we have to look after the interest of the womens team also, Kalmadi said.         
	Asked whether Australian coach Ric Charlesworth could be considered, Kalmadi said: He has already resigned and gone.         
	Interestingly, Kalmadi said that the ad hoc committee and the selection committee did not have a talk with Harendra Singh before selecting the former international as the coach in charge.         
	Harendra later said: I had a closed door meeting with the ad hoc committee members. What transpired there, I dont want do discuss. I am looking for positive results when I start the camp in Bangalore in October.         
	It was also announced that the following players have been added to the list of probables for major international tournaments:               
	Dilip Tirkey, Bimal Lakra, Deepak Thakur, Ajitesh Roy, Bharat Chhikara, Ignace Tirkey, V. S. Vinay, Kuljeet Singh, Amit Singh, Bikas Toppo and Kalu Ram.

	As I sat down in front of the television at National Institute of Sports, Patiala on Friday to watch Vijender Kumar in action in Beijing, my mind raced back to the day when I fought the then world No. 3 Wongprates Sontaya of Thailand in the Asian Games semi-final.         
	Unlike in Beijing, the crowd in Bangkok in 1998 was partisan and hostile. But I managed to win the bout and went on to bag the gold for India in the bantamweight class.         
	Today too, I was hopeful that Vijender would make the final. I had full faith in him and had he been a little more tactical, would have made the title round.         
	If I go purely from the boxing point of view, Vijender lost but was not disgraced. He fought superbly throughout. The 8-5 margin was close, and with some luck, it could have swung Indias way.         
	I am in Patiala to do my coaching diploma in boxing. We adhere to strict rules here, but today all of us were too excited to follow the guidelines. Long before the bout started, everyone positioned themselves in front of the TV.         
	I was not unduly perturbed when Vijender went down 0-2 in the first round. I was sure of his comeback which he almost did in the second round. But a few small mistakes in the last two rounds cost him the bout.         
	First of all, he could have been a little more aggressive in the third round. I was always expecting him to land his best punches in these two minutes. He was a bit hesitant, though there can be no denying the fact that the Cubans defensive tactics was exceptionally good.         
	Im sure the coaches present in Beijing briefed Vijender correctly in the final round, but he was not able to take advantage of the warning that the Polish referee issued to his opponent for foul play. Vijender should have launched an onslaught at that point of time.         
	Time was short, so that was the only way to pick up a few more points. But then, despite the defeat, it was a great day for Indian boxing. After all, for the first time we will watch an Indian pugilist on the Olympic podium. Hardly anyone considered Vijender a great prospect when he left for Beijing. Now he is coming back a hero.         
	I think Vijender has helped Indian boxing to take a giant leap. Now parents will not hesitate to encourage their children take up boxing. My advice to parents is that please dont think boxing is something of a street brawl.         
	It is a game of huge skill and please encourage your sons and daughters to take up the sport.         
	In the end, I must admit that these five Indian boxers in Beijing Olympics have done a great favour to me. Till a few days back, I was on the verge of quitting as an active boxer, but the performances of Akhil Kumar, Jitender Kumar and Vijender have given me a new lease of life.         
	So much so that now I am planning to make a comeback in the Commonwealth Games in 2010. Dont be surprised if you see me in the ring again in the 60kg category. It is all because of Vijender and Co.

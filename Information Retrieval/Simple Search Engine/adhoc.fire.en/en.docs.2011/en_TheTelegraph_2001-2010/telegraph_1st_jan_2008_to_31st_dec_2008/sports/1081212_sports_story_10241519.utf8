	Calcutta: In-form pacer Sourav Sarkar is likely to replace Iresh Saxena when Bengal play Vidarbha in their Ranji Trophy Plate group B match at Vidarbha Cricket Association ground in Nagpur from Friday.         
	Bengal, who are almost in the semi-finals, lead the group standings with 18 points from three wins and one draw.         
	They are clearly considered the favourites against Vidarbha, who, with 10 points, are out of contention for a semi-final berth.         
	According to coach Utpal Chatterjee, the pitch will be a bowling paradise for the first two days and will help the batsmen thereafter.         
	I think the pitch will help bowlers in the first two days Batsmen need to be cautious, Utpal said from Nagpur on Thursday.         
	It was learnt that Dibyendu Chakraborty will bat at No. 6 while wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha will come in at No. 3.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjun Atwal misses cut
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arjun Atwal misses cut
                      
	Livermore: Arjun Atwals inconsistent form continued with the Orlando-based Indian failing to make the cut in the 600,000 Livermore Valley Wine Country Championship.         
	After his opening round of 73, an equally average round would have kept him for the weekend action but Atwal stuttered to a horrendous 10-over 82 to crash out with a 36-hole total of 155. The cut was set at 147.         
	Barring the lone birdie on the eighth hole, it was a horror story for this seasons Malaysian Open champion.         
	Atwal got off to a disastrous double-bogey start and dropped shots on the sixth and ninth holes as well to take the turn at five-over. On his way back, it was more or less the same story for Atwal.         
	As if a bogey hattrick from the 12th-14th holes was not enough, he signed off with back-to-back bogeys.         
	Overnight leader J. J. Killeen (69) consolidated his grip on the lead with a two-day total of 134, five shots clear of Aaron Price (69) and Joe Daly (70).         
	In Manila, Indias Arjun Singh fired a one-over 73 to be at tied 21st after the third round of The Philippines Open on Saturday.         
	Filipino Angelo Que is in the lead after shooting an impressive 66 for a total of six-under 210.         
	Himmat Singh Rai slipped from overnight tied 52nd to tied 60th with a total of 11-over 227 after he shot 78.           (PTI)

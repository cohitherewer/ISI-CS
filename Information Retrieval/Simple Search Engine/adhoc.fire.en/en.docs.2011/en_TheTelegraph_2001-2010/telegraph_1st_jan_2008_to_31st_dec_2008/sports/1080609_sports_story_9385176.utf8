The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Daunting task for France 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Daunting task for France 
                      
	Zurich: France launch a new era in tentative fashion when they kick off their Euro 2008 campaign against Romania on Monday.         
	The 2006 World Cup runners-up, facing a daunting task in a tough Group C also featuring the Netherlands and world champions Italy, are unsure what to expect from their first major finals in more than a decade without Zinedine Zidane as playmaker.         
	With the balding maestro now retired France need to find a new talisman and the right balance between ageing stalwarts and exciting youngsters.         
	There is room for hope with winger Franck Ribery ready to take over Zidanes role and 20-year-old striker Karim Benzema determined to prove himself on the big stage.         
	But concerns persist after a struggle to qualify, timid performances in warm-up games and the thigh injury sustained by captain Patrick Vieira that will sideline him in Zurich on Monday.         
	Thierry Henry is also doubtful, teammate Lilian Thuram said. Henry has not trained since pulling out of Fridays session because of a knock received in the 1-0 warm-up win over Colombia in Paris last Tuesday, his 100th cap.         
	Its true he has not been able to train and I dont know if he will be able to start the match, Thuram told reporters on Sunday.         
	Henry, who has scored a record 44 goals for his country, is expected to be replaced by Nicolas Anelka.         
	The pressure will be on Raymond Domenechs side as Romania, who failed to qualify for the last three major competitions, have everything to gain and nothing to lose.

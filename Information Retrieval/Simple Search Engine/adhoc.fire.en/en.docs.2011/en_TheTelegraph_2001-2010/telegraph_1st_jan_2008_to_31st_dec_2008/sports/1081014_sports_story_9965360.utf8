The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dunga laments hostile welcome
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dunga laments hostile welcome
                      
	San Cristobal (Venezuela): Brazil coach Dunga complained of a hostile reception in Venezuela, saying his players were kept awake at night and that some suffered stomach problems.         
	When we play away from home in the World Cup qualifiers, the whole country unites to try and make things as difficult as possible for Brazil, he told Brazilian reporters after the 4-0 win. They left us stuck in the plane for an hour and a half. Inside the hotel, we also had numerous difficulties during the night. There was a discotheque and a lot of shouting near the players rooms. Four or five players were ill because of the food. This creates a certain difficulty.         
	Dunga also complained that a Brazilian flag was burned at the Pueblo Nuevo stadium and the national anthem was jeered. We show respect for all the teams and ask for respect for us, he added.         
	Brazil raced to a 3-0 lead in only 19 minutes with Kaka scoring the first goal only six minutes into his first international for 11 months. Its very good to be back and even better to score a goal on my return, said Kaka.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia on Friday thanked the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) for its hospitality to the Australia team touring India, according to a Cricket Australia release.         
	Commenting on the facilities offered to Australia by the RCA, Cricket Australias acting CEO Michael Brown said: It is important for any touring cricket team to acclimatise to the conditions before a big series and were grateful to the Rajasthan Cricket Association for the hospitality theyve extended to Australia and the high quality of the facilities on offer at RCAs academy in Jaipur.         
	We look forward to extending the same courtesies to India when they next tour Australia as part of the successful and ongoing bilateral relationship between Cricket Australia and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	The Australians, who landed in India a week before the official start of the tour, were provided with the top-quality training facilities by the RCA.         
	But BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty had objected to it by saying they were being obliged more than expected.

                                                   Zvonareva to play in Bangalore

           
	Bangalore: World No. 21 Vera Zvonareva will participate in the Bangalore Open 2008 to be held from March 3-9. Having lost the final in three sets in Doha last week to Maria Sharapova, Zvonareva has decided to take a short break before she heads to Bangalore. 
    
	It has been a great week for me in Doha. Of course, I wish I could do better in the finals, but I still have lots of things to work on. I am improving with every match and it was great to make a final in the first event after I was injured in Australia. I will spend a couple of days in Moscow relaxing and get ready for Bangalore, she said in a statement. 
    
	Other top players in the $600,000 Tier II event includes the Williams sisters, Patty Schnyder, Jelena Jankovic and Agnes Szavay. (PTI)

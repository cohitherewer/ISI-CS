	Galle: It was a strenuous workout for Team India on Tuesday with stress on tackling the spin bowlers and working on close catches as they prepared to put the ignominy of innings defeat behind and move ahead for the second Test starting here on Thursday.         
	The Indians seemed unsure whether to take on the menacing Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis head on or opt for a copy book defence.         
	While Anil Kumble amp; Co. took to the nets on early morning, the Sri Lankans opted for an afternoon practice session.         
	The small boundaries could tempt players such as Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Kumara Sangakkara to have a go at the bowlers. We have to learn from mistakes: Robin         
	Meanwhile, according to fielding coach Robin Singh, the Indians are geared up for an improved performance in the second Test. He said the team had learnt from their mistakes in Colombo.         
	We were very low after the defeat in the last Test (in Colombo) but we are mentally in a better shape right now. Everyone is trying to lift their game, Robin said.         
	There have been a few lapses in the past that wont be repeated. Most people are aware of their responsibilities. We had a bad day (in the last Test) but we will come back strongly, he said.         
	India suffered batting collapses in the first Test against Sri Lanka when they were bowled out cheaply in both the innings and Robin felt the onus would be on the batsmen to give a good start if they have to get back to their winning ways.         
	Everyone is prepared in their own way. If each player plays well, if we are able to get a good start, it will be good. Rest of the batsman can follow, he said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Security is top priority: ECB
                                                                                                                                                                                           Security is top priority: ECB
                      
	Bhubaneswar: The remainder of Englands one-day series against India was on Thursday scrapped following the terror attacks in Mumbai which also prompted the organisers of the $ 6million Champions League to postpone the high-profile Twenty20 event.         
	While England will return home without playing the last two matches of the seven-ODI series, a final decision on the fate of the Test series will be taken later with the ECB making it clear that it would abide by the security advice by various sources.         
	After a prolonged meeting with top England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) officials and the England team management, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary N. Srinivasan told a press conference in Bhubaneswar that the Guwahati and New Delhi one-dayers have been called off in view of the security apprehensions expressed by the visiting team.         
	ECB managing director Hugh Morris said they would be holding discussions with the BCCI on the Test series, which is still hanging fire. Apart from Ahmedabad, Mumbai, where terrorist attacks have killed over a 100 people since Wednesday night, is one of the venues for the two-match Test series.         
	This morning I held initial discussions with the BCCI Secretary N. Srinivasan, as well as representatives of the Indian team management at the team hotel in Bhubaneswar. I have also briefed the England players and management on the situation as well as liaising closely with the ECB chairman and chief executive and the players representatives, Morris said in a statement.         
	He later addressed a press conference and said the Test series would depend on the nature of security advice the team gets from various sources.         
	We are looking at several options and we will go by the security advisors. If they advise us to play in India, we will play the Test series. However, the players are desperate and disturbed over the incidents in Mumbai, he said.         
	The events of last night were deeply distressing and the situation is still unfolding. We are urgently seeking information from expert sources regarding last nights attacks and will continue to hold further discussions with our colleagues from the BCCI over the next 24 hours, Morris said.         
	Morris said the safety and security of the team could not be compromised at any stage.         
	The safety and security of the England team is of the utmost importance to ECB. We have reviewed all our security arrangements in the light of these attacks and will be taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of the team. On behalf of the Board and the England team, we would like to express our condolences to the families and friends of those people who were killed or injured in last nights attacks, Morris said.         
	England will stay put in Bhubaneswar for a day before returning home.           (PTI)

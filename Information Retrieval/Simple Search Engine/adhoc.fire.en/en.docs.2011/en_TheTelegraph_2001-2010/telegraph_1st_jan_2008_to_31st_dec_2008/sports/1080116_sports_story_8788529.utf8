                                                     Letter to Procter

   
	The Telegraph has obtained a copy of the letter sent to Mike Procter by Indian team manager Chetan Chauhan and captain Anil Kumble requesting the Match Referee to withdraw the charge against Australian spinner Brad Hogg. The following is the text:
 
	Dear Mr Mike Procter
 
	The Indian team has always played the game hard and fair, upholding the hoary traditions of the gentlemens game.
 
	In order to help to create a congenial atmosphere and in the larger interest of the game, the Indian team has decided not to press the charge against Australian player Brad Hogg. This is in keeping with the highest Indian traditions and ethos.
 
	We also firmly believe that on-field problems between the two teams are to be sorted out between the players and we sincerely believe that this should have been adhered to by both the teams.
 
	In keeping with the spirit of sportsmanship and in the larger interests of the game, I request you on behalf of the Indian cricket team to consider the charge withdrawn and we deeply appreciate your support in this regard.
 
	Best wishes and warm regards,

 Signed by Chetan Chauhan and Anil Kumble

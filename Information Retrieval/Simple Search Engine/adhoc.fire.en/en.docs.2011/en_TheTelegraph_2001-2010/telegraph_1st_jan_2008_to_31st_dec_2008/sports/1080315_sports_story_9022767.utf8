  - DEODHAR TROPHY
  -   Dravids 139 runs off 138 balls in vain               Rahul Dravid scored 139                           
	Hyderabad: Former India captain Rahul Dravid hit a dazzling century but East Zone still defeated South by 23 runs in a Deodhar Trophy match here on Friday.         
	Electing to bat, East Zone posted a challenging 274 for five in 50 overs. In reply, South Zone were dismissed for 251 in 48.3 overs.         
	Dravid was the lone bright spot for South Zone in their defeat as the middle-order batsman, who came to the crease after the fall of opener Dinesh Karthik (3), slammed 139 runs off 138 balls with 13 boundaries and a six.         
	Dravid and Arjun Yadav (42) held the innings together for some time with a 83-run partnership after South Zone had struggled to 89 for three.         
	Yadavs dismissal proved too costly as rest of the South Zone batsmen fell cheaply to leave Dravid stranded.         
	The other blow for South Zone was V.V.S. Laxmans injury which prevented him from taking to the field during batting. Laxman was injured while fielding.         
	For East Zone, paceman Dhiraj Goswami was the pick of the bowlers, bagging three for 42 while Ranadeb Bose chipped in with two wickets.         
	Earlier, captain Laxmi Ratan Shuklas (73) scintillating half-century powered East Zone past the 270 mark.         
	Shukla hit five sixes in his 66-ball knock and stitched a 101-run partnership with Saurabh Tiwary (73) for the fifth wicket.         
	Prasanta Saha contributed 21 runs lower down the order and helped build an unbeaten 58-run sixth-wicket partnership with his captain.         
	R. Vinay Kumar was the most successful bowler for South Zone, claiming three wickets.           (PTI)

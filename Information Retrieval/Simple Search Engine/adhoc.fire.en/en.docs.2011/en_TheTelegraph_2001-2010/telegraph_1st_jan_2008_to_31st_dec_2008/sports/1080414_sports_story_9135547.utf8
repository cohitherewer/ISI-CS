The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni basks in deliberate ploy
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dhoni basks in deliberate ploy
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Harbhajan Singh in action on Sunday                           
	Kanpur: Team Indias stand-in captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Sunday described the use of his part-time bowlers as a deliberate ploy, keeping in mind the nature of the wicket.         
	In India, the third-day wicket is generally like fourth day wicket; it spins a lot. Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) and Viru (Virender Sehwag) and other bowlers bowled in right areas and didnt give any chance to batsmen to rotate the strike, Dhoni told a news conference after India squared the series against South Africa at the Green Park.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Using the part-time bowers         
	It was a deliberate ploy in the first innings. There was not much help for pacers. In India, the third-day wicket is generally like fourth day wicket; it spins a lot. Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) and Viru (Sehwag) and other bowlers bowled in right areas and didnt give any chance to batsmen to rotate the strike. Viru is much more than a part-timer on this kind of wicket. We knew that with him and Yuvraj in the team we would not need an extra spinner.         
	Will you give credit to your bowlers or the pitch?         
	Australia has bounce, England has swing and New Zealand has seam and we have spin. Every place has its speciality. Its not about the wicket your are playing on but how you are playing The credit should go to both the bowlers and the batsmen.         
	Gary Kirstens presence         
	Gary has motivated the players and helped us stay focused. He cant change much at this level and he needs time to settle down.         
	Strategy behind opening the attack with Harbhajan Singh (in the second innings)         
	We knew the new ball would turn. With the seam there was bounce too. From one end, we kept the seamers on and from the other end spinners, so that the seamers remained fresh for the older ball for reverse swing.         
	On Sreesanth-Ishant Sharma stand         
	Every partnership was crucial on this wicket. Since it was not a high scoring game, we could play the mind game by taking a good lead Thats why the last wicket partnership was crucial.         
	Leading in the Test         
	Every challenge is different but its easier to lead the side on a wicket like this. Everything worked for me.         
	Missing Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble         
	Well we did well, but it doesnt mean we are better off without Sachin or Anil. Who is there to replace Sachin? Who is there to replace Kumble? It is better to have them in the side than not, but the credit goes to the boys who stood up in their absence. The win was very crucial but both were missed in the match. Had Kumble played the match wouldnt have lasted three days.         
	The second and third Tests ended in three days. Was it a sweet revenge?         
	Dont believe in a revenge theory, but we enjoyed the game.

	Beijing: Among the most famous table tennis players in China is a celebrity whose face sells everything from flooring to golf courses. The Chinese so adore this icon that they nicknamed him Lao Wa  or old friend. Fans from as far away as Tokyo flock to his restaurant.         
	They come to meet the man with light brown hair and blue eyes. They come to eat Swedish meatballs. They come to shake hands with the Michael Jordan of table tennis. Jan-Ove Waldner means many things to the people here. But he is not Chinese. He is Swedish, and yet somehow, he is still their own.         
	On Thursday night at Waldners Swedish restaurant, W Bar, Olympic table tennis was played on two projection screens while staff members wearing kitchen aprons engaged in the real thing on a regulation table placed between the back wall and the bar. At nightfall, lights were dimmed and candles lit and the sound of table tennis pinged off the restaurants walls.         
	There was a certain romance to it: table tennis by candlelight.         
	Where did this love of Waldner begin? How did a country with a monopoly on table tennis stars come to embrace the one outsider who consistently beat them?         
	He paused. At which point his daughter, Li Ying, filled silence with the truth.         
	We hated him at first, she said. Eventually, we started to love him.         
	Perhaps pictures explained it best, Li Gu said, moving toward the shrine to Waldner.         
	Photographs of Waldner covered every inch of the wall. Photographs of him grown, a champion, with the Chinese cheering the man they once disdained. Li Gu pointed to one photograph.         
	This picture tells a story, he said. This is a story about revenge.         
	For the next five minutes, he talked with the glide of a natural storyteller. This story took place in India in 1987. Waldner became ill a few days before the Swedish team was set to take on the indestructible Chinese. Coaches and friends begged him not to play.         
	Waldner did play. The picture gives away the ending: his face flush and long and filled with the glare of competitor who has only seconds ago been beaten. The Chinese coaches are seen jumping in the background, their arms raised in triumph.         
	I will be back, Li Gu said Waldner muttered to himself.         
	Waldner played the Chinese team two years later. Sweden won, 5-0. The picture of that team hangs on a wall in that back room  the boys in blue, long-haired and blue-eyed, conquerors of China, the table tennis power.         
	This was like a nuclear bomb, Li Gu said. Boom! The unbeatable were beaten. The Great Wall of table tennis was finally broken.         
	But even that only partly explains Waldners appeal here. Li Gu breaks it down into three components, the first being that Waldner was the first to compete with and regularly beat the Chinese. The second being his lack of arrogance, his everyman image. But most importantly he showed the proper respect to China and its national obsession.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The decision of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to do away with the age verification tests has reduced the ongoing National under-16 championships for the Mir Iqbal Hussain Trophy to a farce.         
	What is going on here in is a complete mockery of the age group championship, said Bengal joint coach Sushi Chakrabarty from Mahilpur in Punjab. Several states, barring a few like Bengal and Goa, have fielded over-age players.         
	Hosts Punjab, Assam and a few north east states seem to be the biggest culprits but nothing can be proved unless boys are forced to undergo proper medical tests, the coach added.         
	The mess, some people alleged, was created by the federation. Two months prior to the tournament, the regulations circulated by the AIFF stated that it was mandatory for every participating team to do the MRI tests of the boys.         
	Surprisingly, 10 days before the start of the championships, the AIFF circulated yet another letter to all state associations saying it was not obligatory for the teams to do the tests.Federation sources said the MRI tests were waived after many state associations said they could not bear the cost.         
	This is very surprising, said Savio Messias, the secretary of the Goa Football Association (GFA). The purpose of the tournament has been defeated because of age tampering. We too are receiving a lot of complaints from our team management, he added.         
	A seasoned coach, who was, once associated with the national team at the age group level, said the federation, should pay for the MRI tests.         
	We get to hear that the AIFF has a huge sponsor for the under-16 team. Why cant the AIFF use some of that money to host a proper tournament, he asked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I expected call-up for ODIs: Vijay
                                                                                                                                                                                                     I expected call-up for ODIs: Vijay
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Opening batsman Murali Vijay Krishna, who has been impressive in his debut in the fourth Test, on Friday said that he had actually expected a call-up for the India one-day squad.         
	I have been playing well and did well in the Challenger Trophy. So I expected to be called up for the ODIs. I got it for the Tests. So I was ready, Vijay Murali told reporters after the second days play.         
	It was not surprising as I have been doing well over the last three months. I got picked for both the ODIs and Tests, which had been a dream for me. I am living it now.         
	The national selectors on Wednesday also included him in the 15-man squad for the first three ODIs against England later this month.         
	The 24-year-old Tamil Nadu player said he had not been anxious about sharing the dressing room with the seniors.         
	I knew some of them already. The senior players spoke to me and made me feel comfortable, he said.         
	Vijay Murali, who was called up as a replacement for Gautam Gambhir, was asked to join the Indian team while in the middle of a Ranji Trophy match.         
	I had scored a double hundred that day and so was feeling happy when the call came. Right through the travel to Nagpur I was enjoying myself, he said.         
	The youngster was calm and confident during his knock of 33 on the first day (Thursday).         
	Its a good feeling to be playing alongside Virender Sehwag. When you have someone like him, you dont need to worry about scoring runs, he said. I tried to do my part, be comfortable and stay there as long as possible.

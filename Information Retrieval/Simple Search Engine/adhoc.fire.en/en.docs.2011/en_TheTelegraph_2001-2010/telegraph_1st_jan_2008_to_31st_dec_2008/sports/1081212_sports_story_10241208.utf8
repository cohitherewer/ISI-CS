The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss: Great to be playing 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Strauss: Great to be playing 
  - First test 
  -  INDIA FIGHT BACK AFTER GOOD START BY ENGLISH OPENERS         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Zaheer Khan at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Thursday. (AFP)                                 
	Chennai: Andrew Strauss termed his 233 ball 123 on Thursday as very special. Playing, as he is, after some length of time, he said there was no pressure on him to perform and that he relied solely on instinct.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His innings         
	It was pretty hard to begin with, getting out of the net mode and switching to Test match mode. It was such a flat wicket to begin with It was a case of my concentrating hard and helping the team to be in a pretty good position.         
	On playing after a long gap         
	I havent played Test cricket for close to three months In the first half-hour, it was pretty hard to get out of the mental baggage. But it is comfortable for me since I have done it for a long time. As I said before the first hour or so it was a case of my getting the pace and adapting to the conditions. If you cannot score runs on a flat wicket, you struggle. It was slightly trickier playing reverse swing. The pace bowlers were getting some reverse swing and the spinners a little more bounce.         
	His approach         
	I was really comfortable and did not want to go for anything big. There was some good bowling. Zaheer Khan was excellent with his reverse swing. Ishant Sharma too. They were bowling exceptionally well. We would have like to be about two wickets less than where we are now. Matt Prior can play pretty well in these circumstances. We need to get 350 to 400 to get to a winning position and put pressure on the Indians.         
	The lead-up to the Test         
	There has been so much talk about our coming back and whether it is a right thing to do or not. The cricket side has not been seen as important during the last three days leading up to the Test. It was such a relief to concentrate on the Test. I think from both sets of players point of view it is fantastic to finally get to play. This is a great place to play Test cricket and it is always an education playing here whether you play spin or reverse swing. If you do not enjoy playing here, you are not enjoying in most places.         
	If he would term the century historic         
	This is an important Test for the game of cricket. We came back and showed that the game will continue. To get a hundred is very special. I do not want to kind of overplay my role. It is always important to score runs, particularly in Test matches. I have never thought what will happen if my place in the side is there or not. I did not feel any pressure in coming and playing here today.         
	His mental preparation         
	I felt no anxieties in the last ten days or so. I was one of the first guys to decide in favour of the tour. The security chief was saying that it is getting worse. I think I did a right thing. I am talking only for myself. It is a great relief mentally with security officials standing with machine guns and things like that. During the last three days, I was only concentrating on playing the Test match. It made me feel both refreshed and focused.         
	On Amit Mishra         
	He looks a very promising bowler to me. He has excellent variations. He was a bit slow with his deliveries today. I can imagine that on a quicker wicket, it will be harder work for a batsman.         
	The wicket         
	There was some scruff on the bowlers follow-through and the wicket is going to break further. I think spin is going to play an increasingly dominant role in this game. Now it is a bit slower, but it will be quicker as the game progresses. It will be hard work for both sides.  
	DAY I HIGHLIGHTS  
	Andrew Strauss became the 100th cricketer to make 4000 runs in Test cricket.  
	Strauss (when on 57) became the 27th England player to reach the 4000-run mark. He is the 6th English left-hander to do so.  
	Strauss recorded his 13th Test hundred. It was also his second hundred in as many Tests on Indian soil. It may be recalled that he had scored 128 in the first innings of the 3rd Test of the 2005-06 series in Mumbai. It is also his second hundred of 2008 and 6th away from home. Interestingly, England have never lost a Test when Strauss has scored a 100.  
	Strauss has also scored a hundred in his last three first-class matches. Playing for Middlesex, Strauss scored 101 vs Worcestershire and 172 vs Northamptonshire in September 2008, before making a third consecutive century on Thursday.  
	Graeme Swann became the 641st player to play Test cricket for England. He is the third player to make his debut for England in Tests in the year 2008. The other two are Tim Ambrose and Darren Pattinson.  
	Incidentally, the last off-spinner to make his debut for England was Shaun Udal in November 2005.  
	By playing this match, Sachin Tendulkar now has the longest career span by an Indian in Test cricket.  
	India are playing their 14th Test of the year 2008. The most by any country so far. South Africa, however, have played 13 and are due to play three more.  
	England are playing their 50th Test match on Indian soil. They are the only visiting country to do so.

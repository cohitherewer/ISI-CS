The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Drogba set to decide shortly

	Drogba set to decide shortly   
	Didier Drogba is set to decide on his immediate future in the next ten days and although an official approach has not yet been made, Milans technical director Leonardo sounded out the clubs interest in Drogba saying they are, waiting for the right time to move. Barcelona, meanwhile, offered a swap deal with Samuel Eto, but Chelsea declined the offer. Meanwhile, Chelsea are set to sign AC Milans world player-of-the- year Kaka for a world-record fee of 79.2m.     
	Liverpool bid  
	 Liverpool are also considering a second attempt to sign Espanyols Albert Riera. The Spanish international winger is on the wish-list, although a deal is proving hard to nail down, especially since his club turned down Liverpools 9.5 million offer for the player.           
	United interest   
	 Falcao, who is similar in style to Carlos Tevez, could be brought in to bolster Uniteds attacking options should Ronaldo decide to leave. Falcao has scored 38 goals in 58 games for River Plate so far, and would cost around 15 million.           
	Saha on loan  
	 Less speculation and sensation surrounds the expected departure of Louis Saha, who will in all probability be sent out on loan to Roma this summer, although the Italian club will likely sign the striker on a permanent deal in due course.

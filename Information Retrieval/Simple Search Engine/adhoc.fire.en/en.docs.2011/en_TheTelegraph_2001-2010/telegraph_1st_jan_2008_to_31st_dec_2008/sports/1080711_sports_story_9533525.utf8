The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds still unsure of playing in Pak
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Symonds still unsure of playing in Pak
                      
	Sydney: Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds still feels unsafe to travel to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy in September.         
	Players from Australia, New Zealand and England have expressed concern over playing in Pakistan due to the unstable condition there. The concerns seem to have aggravated after the recent suicide blasts in Pakistan.         
	Symonds said he was yet to be convinced that Pakistan has become a safe place to go and play cricket, though he would keep an open mind.         
	My feelings havent changed a great deal, said Symonds, who first raised objections about Australias scheduled, but later postponed, tour of Pakistan in April.         
	It is only a game of cricket at the end of the day, and putting yourself in a position where youre not safe, is ridiculous, said Symonds. (PTI)

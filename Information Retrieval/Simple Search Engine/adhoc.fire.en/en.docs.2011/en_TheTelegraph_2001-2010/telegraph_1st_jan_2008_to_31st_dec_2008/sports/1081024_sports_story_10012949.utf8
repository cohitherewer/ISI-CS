The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karun to test drive for Force India
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Karun to test drive for Force India
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai: Karun Chandhoks Formula One ambitions are all set to get a succour in the coming days in the form of a test drivers role with the Force India F1 team for the 2009 season.         
	The 23-year-old from Chennai drove for I-Sport in the GP2 Series this year and would in all probability be competing in the F1 feeder series for one more season, either with the current team or another. Yet, being a test driver with an F1 team would serve as a stepping stone to the big league whenever the opportunity arises.         
	It would be ideal for Chandhok if he gets a full-fledged testing role in 2009. Testing is restricted in F1 as a cost-cutting measure, so he can be both driving in GP2 and do the testing, sources said.         
	With India to host an F1 Grand Prix in 2011, it would also be in Force Indias favour to have a home grown driver in their line-up.         
	Chandhok is currently in discussion with a few other teams apart from I-Sport, which itself is backed by Red Bull, another F1 team.

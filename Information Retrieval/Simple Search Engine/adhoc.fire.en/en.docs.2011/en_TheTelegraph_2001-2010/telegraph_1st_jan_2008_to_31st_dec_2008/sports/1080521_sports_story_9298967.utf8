Barton jailed   for 6 months   Liverpool: Newcastle midfielder Joey Barton has been jailed for six months after admitting to charges of assault and affray.

Euro yellow cards rule  Moscow: Uefa ruled on Tuesday that single yellow cards given at the Euro 2008 will be cancelled after the quarter finals to help players avoid suspension for the final.

                                                   Atwal vows to return to PGA Tour

           
	New Delhi: In the past one-and-a-half years, Arjun Atwal has fallen from the PGA Tour perch, almost lost his Nationwide Tour card and survived a fatal car crash, but the Indian can finally see light at the end of the tunnel. 
    
	The first Indian to make it to the big league of the PGA Tour, hardly anything has gone right for the Orlando-based golfer since a fairytale 2005 season, when he came very close to lifting the Bellsouth Classic before losing the plot in the play-off. Atwal almost missed his Nationwide Tour card too. 
    
	A tied-second finish in the Panama Movistar Championship has convinced him that a return to the PGA Tour is just a matter of time. 
    
	I have had a tough one-and-a-half years but I hope that phase is behind me. All I need is to win three Nationwide Tour titles or at least finish among the top 25 in the money list there to return to the PGA Tour again. This is something I have to get and Im sure Ill get it, he said at the Delhi Golf Club, ahead of this weeks Indian Masters. 
    
	Atwal, also the first Indian to win a European Tour event, has committed himself for two other marquee events scheduled here this month  the SAIL Open and the Johnnie Walker Classic  which would see him miss a number of Nationwide Tour events. 
    
	Atwal, however, is not perturbed. Of course I would miss a few events in Mexico, New Zealand and Australia but thats not a big deal. I think I would still have enough tournaments to perform and win my PGA Tour card, he said. 
    
	Dwelling on the Indian Masters, Atwal tipped local favourite Jyoti Randhawa to be the man to beat. Jyoti is an obvious favourite here, he wins everything at DGC. But I have a decent record here too, he said. (PTI)

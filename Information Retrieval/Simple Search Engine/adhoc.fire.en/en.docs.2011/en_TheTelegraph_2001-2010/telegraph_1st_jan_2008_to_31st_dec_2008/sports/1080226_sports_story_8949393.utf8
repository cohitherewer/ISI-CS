The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India lodge written complaint over Aussie behaviour
                                                   India lodge written complaint over Aussie behaviour
  - Were not cry babies but... we cant allow our players to be regularly sledged: Soni       A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                            
	Hobart/Calcutta: Bitterness has again crept into the relationship between Indian and Australian cricketers with the Indian team management on Monday lodging a written complaint with the Match Referee about the hosts provocative behaviour.         
	The Indians, whose tour Down Under has been marked by a racism row and a series of on-field altercations, have threatened to take befitting action if Ricky Ponting and his men persist with such behaviour.         
	We have written to the Match Referee, Jeff Crowe, and will take befitting action if it (provocation) continues, team manager Dr Vimal Soni said.         
	Young fast bowler Ishant Sharma was on Monday docked 15 per cent of his match fee for finger pointing at an abrasive Andrew Symonds on Sunday in Sydney.         
	It led the Indians draft a strongly worded letter to Crowe in which they mentioned specific incidents of provocation by the Australians.         
	Contacted by The Telegraph on Monday, Dr Soni said: We are not cry babies but obviously we cant allow our players to be regularly sledged.         
	Im happy that the Match Referee has given me an assurance that he will soon talk to the Australian team management on the issues raised in my letter, he added.         
	We accept the Match Referees decision for Ishant to have transgressed the Code of Conduct, Dr Soni said, adding: We also wanted him to have a look at the provocation which the Australians have been repeatedly providing in the series.         
	Much has happened in the recent past and we didnt want to open up old wounds by making a complaint. But we have mentioned specific incidents in the letter, he said.         
	The specific incidents, it is learnt, concerned the repeated jabbering which Ponting kept directing at Harbhajan Singh on Sunday as well as Matthew Hayden allegedly calling the off-spinner a mad boy.         
	Harbhajan, along with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, drew the attention of the on-field umpires at Haydens antics during the big partnership between him and Ponting.         
	The Indians are adamant that the Ishant-Symonds spat happened as a result of the provocation by the Australian allrounder. Our plea was that Symonds provoked Ishant and thats why he did what he did, said Dr Soni.         
	Even though the Match Referee has promised to have a word with Ponting, the latter had said on Sunday night that Symonds didnt start the argument. He (Symonds) acted in response to what was said to him  he didnt start the incident, Ponting said after his side had won a cliffhanger by 18 runs.         
	Dr Soni, on his part, clarified that he didnt want the matter to escalate and develop into a full-blown controversy.         
	We could have filed another complaint but we did not want to start another hearing, he said.         
	Australia coach Tim Nielsen, however, lost little time in defending his boys and said the opposition should look at their own behaviour.         
	Its interesting how much opposition teams are talking about what we are doing. At the moment, as far as I can see, we are the only team that is in the finals, he said.         
	I said last week it may be time for them to start looking at things in their own backyard, he added.         
	Nielsen warned that nothing could reduce the Australians intensity and they would continue to play the game hard.         
	There is no doubt that both teams are playing the game very hard, no inch is asked for, and no inch is given, and thats how we like to play the game, he said.

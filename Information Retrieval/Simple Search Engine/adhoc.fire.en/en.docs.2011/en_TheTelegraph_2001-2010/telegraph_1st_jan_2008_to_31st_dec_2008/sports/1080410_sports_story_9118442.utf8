The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Expect India to field 3 spinners: Arthur 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Expect India to field 3 spinners: Arthur 
                  Mickey Arthur                     
	Kanpur: South African coach Mickey Arthur on Wednesday sought to put the beleaguered Indians on the back foot ahead of the third and final Test, saying that his players were well equipped to counter the turning track prepared to suit the home teams spinners.         
	Arthur said his team expected such a track after wrapping up the second Test in Ahmedabad in three days and were not unduly worried at the prospect of facing a three-pronged spin attack from the hosts.         
	We expected such a wicket for this match after what happened in Ahmedabad. The wicket will go through the top very early but we are prepared for it. We are quiet confident of doing well in this match also, Arthur told reporters here.         
	Although there was some grass on the Green Park track, it was shaven off on Wednesday morning and it was expected that the pitch would break quickly.         
	The Indians, trailing the three-match series 0-1, have no option but to win the last match to level the series.         
	We are prepared for all the eventualities. We expect India to go in with three spinners in such conditions. We also have the option of two spinners but we have not taken a decision on the team composition yet. I expect the track to deteriorate quickly, he said.         
	The South African coach said his team had been presented with an opportunity to win a series against India at their own backyard and all the players were geared up for the crucial game.         
	We had a long chat on how it could be achieved. Our feet are back on the ground after the splendid victory in Ahmedabad. This is the final challenge and we hope to end it in glory. The team have been awesome throughout the summer and it will be great to finish with a series win, Arthur said.         
	Asked whether the poor form of skipper Anil Kumble had been a big help for the South Africans, Arthur said: He is a fierce competitor and he will come back hard at us. He would not like to lose at home and there will be some pressure on him. But he is an unbelievable cricketer and he will bounce back.         
	Arthur said that his team had a game plan to counter every Indian bowler and they were not thinking of Kumble alone.         
	We have a game plan for all the bowlers and not Kumble alone. He is no doubt one of the top bowlers in the world, one of the legends in the game. We will give him the respect he deserves, he said.         
	On whether the toss would play a big role, he said: Sometimes it is sad when the toss becomes so crucial. We will be happy if it lands in our favour.         
	Arthur also made it clear that pace sensation Dale Steyn would be fit to take the field for the match.         
	Dale has a little niggle but it is not serious. He will play. There are no injury issues in the team. All the other players are in good shape.         
	South African paceman Morne Morkel said he was getting quite used to the subcontinental conditions.         
	I am looking forward to the match. It is a great opportunity to win a series in India. I will go into the match with a positive mindset, he said.                 (PTI)

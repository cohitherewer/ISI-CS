The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hamilton demoted to ninth

	Sepang: Brazilian Felipe Massa led a Ferrari front row sweep in Malaysian Grand Prix qualifying on Saturday while McLarens championship leader Lewis Hamilton was demoted to ninth place for impeding rivals.         
	Massa secured the 10th pole position of his career ahead of world champion teammate Kimi Raikkonen to revive Ferraris morale after a dismal start to the season in Australia last weekend.         
	Our championship starts now because what happened in the last race was incredible, said Massa, who also started on pole at Sepang last year.         
	We did not expect that but we did a very good job during the week and hopefully we can put everything together now to have a quick and consistent championship.         
	While the Italian team set the pace, stewards handed Hamilton and Finnish teammate Heikki Kovalainen five place penalties after the pair had qualified together on the second row.         
	Kovalainen will now be eighth on the starting grid for what could be a wet and treacherous race, with 23-year-old Briton Hamilton behind him in ninth place.         
	We accept the stewards decision but would like to add that neither Lewis nor Heikki impeded any of the competitors deliberately, said McLaren chief executive Martin Whitmarsh.         
	It was an unfortunate incident  nothing more, nothing less  and we look forward to tomorrows race.         
	Italian Jarno Trulli, in a Toyota, and Polands Robert Kubica in a BMW Sauber moved up to take the third and fourth slots.         
	Driving in hot and humid conditions under heavy cloud cover, Massa lapped 0.482 seconds quicker than Raikkonen.         
	Ferrari had been in imperious form all weekend and their front row sweep was the teams first since last Septembers Belgian Grand Prix.         
	Raikkonen was still disappointed with his performance after setting the fastest time of the weekend in the second session.         
	I was not too happy with the last section of qualifying, said the Finn. I just could not get a good grip or the best out of the car. But second is a good place to start and we should have a strong race.         
	Its going to be a long, hot race tomorrow and we are not sure about the weather but looking forward, we are quite happy.         
	Hamilton, winner in Melbourne but out-qualified by his new Finnish teammate for the first time, will struggle to repeat last years second place.         
	We changed some things today and Im not really sure whether it was the right way to go or not but well see tomorrow, said the Briton, who had not been off the front row since Belgium last year.         
	I wouldnt say we were on the back foot but for sure they have got a very quick car, he said before the penalty was announced.         
	But they did last year and we took them at the first corner so weve got to remain positive. Weve got to get good points and I think we can still do that.         
	Last years race winner Fernando Alonso, Spains double world champion who has returned to Renault after a difficult year alongside Hamilton at McLaren, was one of those who protested about the McLarens and will start seventh.

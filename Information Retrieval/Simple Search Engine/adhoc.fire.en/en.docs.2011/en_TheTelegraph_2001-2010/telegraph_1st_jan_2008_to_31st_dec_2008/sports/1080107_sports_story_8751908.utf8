	Calcutta: A medal in athletics at the forthcoming Beijing Olympics is a far-fetched dream, sprint queen P.T. Usha said on Sunday. 
    
	I dont think our athletes can get a medal at the Olympics They should show the performance at least a year in advance if they are to win a medal, Usha told The Telegraph from her hometown in Kerala. Having set up the Usha School of Athletics in 2002, the 43-year-old added that they were targeting the 2012 Olympics. Our athletes are doing very well. Im really hopeful of Tintu Luka (400 and 800 m) among others, Usha, who will arrive in the city for the National School Games on Monday, added.

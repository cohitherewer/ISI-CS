The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC gets BCCI reply on Kanpur pitch
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ICC gets BCCI reply on Kanpur pitch
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mahendra Singh Dhoni inspecting the Green Park pitch on the eve of the final Test                           
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday confirmed that it had received correspondence from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) regarding the pitch for the Kanpur Test against South Africa  the third and final one of the three-match series.         
	According to an ICC statement, this is in keeping with a process of pitch monitoring guidelines which is activated when following a match, the pitch or the outfield is marked by the Match Referee on duty as either poor or unfit.         
	If such a report is made  in this case the pitch was marked as poor by Match Referee Roshan Mahanama  then the ICC writes to the home board and asks for its comments on that. The home board (the BCCI) has 14 days to respond.         
	Once that response is received by the ICC then it is considered  along with the match video  by the ICC general Manager (cricket), David Richardson, and the Match Referee.         
	They have the power to impose a sanction that can range from a warning to the home board (along with corrective action required), a fine or if the situation so demands, stripping the venue of international status for a certain period of time.         
	The BCCI has the right of appeal against any sanction imposed on it. The appeal would be heard by a member of the ICCs Code of Conduct Commission. The decision would be final and binding on both sides.         
	The Kanpur pitch saw 32 wickets fall in less than three days as India won the Test by eight wickets.         
	The ICC acted after Mahanama was less than impressed with the Kanpur pitch. Yawning cracks and uneven bounce made life difficult for the batsmen on the track, prompting Mahanama to submit an unflattering report to the ICC.         
	BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty, however, had downplayed the issue on Wednesday and refused to call it a notice from the ICC.         
	India coach Gary Kirsten, too felt there was nothing wrong in taking the home advantage as long as the tracks were not dangerous for the visiting sides.         
	Former South African captain Kepler Wessels also didnt see any problem with the Green Park pitch. India played well and I think there was no problem with the pitch. In a foreign country, you expect the hosts play according to their strength, Wessels, who is currently coach of the IPL team, Chennai Super Kings, had said on his arrival in Chennai on Wednesday.         
	 I dont see the pitch as an issue as far as I am concerned. In fact, I was surprised that the two other tracks (Chennai, Ahmedabad) did not turn that much, Wessels said.

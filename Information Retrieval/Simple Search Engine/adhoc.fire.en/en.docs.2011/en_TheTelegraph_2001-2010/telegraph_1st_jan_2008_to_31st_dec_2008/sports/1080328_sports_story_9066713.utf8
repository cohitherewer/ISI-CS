	What a fantastic effort by the South Africans it has been so far in Chennai. The visitors proved that they are true professionals and swept aside all the controversies that surrounded them before the start of the Test series.         
	There was a big selection controversy before the tour of India started followed by a lot of talk about the Proteas being under-prepared for this series as there was no practice game before the first Test.         
	South Africa also lost some key players such as Andre Nel to injury. Taking all these into account, they have really done well to score 540 in the first innings. Once on the field, Graeme Smith and his men have stayed focused on the game.         
	It looks a very good batting surface, as was evident even when the Indians batted. The ball is coming on nicely and there is hardly any lateral movement for the fast bowlers.         
	Its a tough job for the new ball bowlers in these conditions with the scorching heat also playing its part. In such a scenario, bowlers could end up trying harder, knowing that pitch is not going to assist them too much. I think thats what happened to both Sreesanth and RP Singh. But they are young and its a good learning experience for them.         
	Another important thing for quick bowlers in these conditions is to bowl with a lot of accuracy. Its important to bowl wicket to wicket, with straight fields and not giving anything away.         
	As far as South African bowling is concerned, Steyn and Morkel will try to make an impact every now and then but in general, bowling accurately is the way to go.         
	With heat being a factor, it is important that the pace bowlers are given short bursts so that they can conserve some energy for the last session.         
	Left-arm spinner Paul Harris is a key bowler for us in this game. He has been a fantastic find and bowls accurately. Others also need to chip in and support him.         
	By posting 540 runs on board, the visitors have put the Indians under pressure. The home side have got off to a good start but still need another 248 runs to avoid the follow-on. Until they get there, pressure will continue to be on them.         
	One may say that by scoring over 500 runs, South Africans have made themselves safe in this Test. Though it will be difficult for them to lose from here, I have seen enough cricket to know that there are no certainties in this game.         
	A lot depends now on how the pitch plays. If it starts crumbling towards the end of Day III, as is the case very often in the subcontinent, then we are in for a very interesting game.         
	Finally, a word or two on Hashim Amla. He hasnt played a lot of cricket in the subcontinent and to score 159 in the first Test of a series, and that too against the likes of Kumble and Harbhajan is a big achievement.         
	Agreed, the ball didnt turn too much for the Indian spinners, but still this innings will give Amla a lot of confidence.           PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT GROUP

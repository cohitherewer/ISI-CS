                                                   Sania sets up date with Venus

           
	Melbourne: Indian Sania Mirza showed she was putting the flag controversy that haunted her Australian Open preparations well behind her as she battled to the third round in Melbourne on Thursday. 
    
	The 21-year-old overcame Swiss qualifier Timea Bacsinszky 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 to reach the last 32 and set up a match against Venus Williams. 
    
	Sania said she was looking forward to a meeting Venus, having played her sister, Serena, at the same stage in Melbourne three years ago, when she became the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam event. 
    
	I am very excited to play Venus, she said. I have nothing to lose and feel like I am playing well. I want to try to get a good start. 
    
	In mens doubles play, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi won their respective first round matches. 
    
	Paes and Australian partner Paul Hanley, seeded fifth, had to dig deep to down Luis Horna of Peru and Stefan Koubek of Austria 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-5) in a see-saw battle lasting one hour and 48 minutes. 
    
	Sixth seeds Bhupathi and Mark Knowles registered a 7-6 (12-10), 6-4 victory over the Russian-German pair of Mikhail Youzhny and Mischa Zverev in one hour and 39 minutes. (AGENCIES)

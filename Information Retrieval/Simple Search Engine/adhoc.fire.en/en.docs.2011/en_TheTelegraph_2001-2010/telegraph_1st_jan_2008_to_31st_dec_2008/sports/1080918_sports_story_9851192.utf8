	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board on Thursday said that it would withdraw the life ban on former captain Salim Malik if the court ruled in his favour.         
	The remarks came from the legal counsel of the PCB at a hearing held in a Lahore court where Malik has appealed against the life ban recommended by a match fixing inquiry commission. PCB lawyer Tafazzul Rizvi made it clear that the Board had only followed recommendations of the commission.

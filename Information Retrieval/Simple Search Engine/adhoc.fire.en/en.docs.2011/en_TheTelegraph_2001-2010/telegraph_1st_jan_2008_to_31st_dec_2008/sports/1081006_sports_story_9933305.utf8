	New Delhi: Indias quest for a berth in the junior football World Cup could be badly dented, if they fail to win against fancied Syria on Monday in Tashkent. Its a must-win scenario for Colin Toals boys, before they take on a relatively weaker Indonesia side on Wednesday in their last group match.         
	A boost for the U-16 boys, will be the return of striker Malsawmfelea who is expected to make the starting lineup.

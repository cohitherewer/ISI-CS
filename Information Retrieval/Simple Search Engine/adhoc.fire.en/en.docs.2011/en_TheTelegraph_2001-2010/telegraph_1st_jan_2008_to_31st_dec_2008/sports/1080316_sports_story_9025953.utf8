	London: Manchester United beat Derby County 1-0 at Pride Park to go top of the Premier League. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the only goal after 76 minutes to take United to 67 points, one ahead of Arsenal.         
	Derby, bottom of the table with only one league win all season and beaten 1-6 at Chelsea on Wednesday, offered far tougher resistance than United expected and Ben Foster, making his debut in the United goal, had a busy afternoon.         
	United finally broke through when Wayne Rooney passed for Ronaldo who side-footed home past former United keeper Roy Carroll for his 31st goal of the season.         
	That was one of our hardest games of the season, United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports News. It became a real battle and all credit to them  and their crowd was great, but were delighted to have the three points. The title race is bubbling up nicely.         
	Chelsea maintained their title challenge with a narrow away victory of their own, winning 1-0 at Sunderland with John Terry grabbing the only goal after 10 minutes, his first of the season. Chelsea stay third on 64 points.         
	Fourth-placed Liverpool came from behind to beat Reading 2-1 at Anfield with goals from Javier Mascherano, his first for the club, and Fernando Torres, his 20th in the league this season.         
	Marek Matejovsky had put Reading ahead after five minutes with a searing 20m volley, but a promising afternoon ended on a sour note for the visitors when striker Shane Long threw his shirt at manager Steve Coppell after being substituted.         
	Portsmouth moved above Aston Villa into sixth place after beating them 2-0 at Fratton Park, while West Ham United came from behind to beat Blackburn Rovers 2-1 at Upton Park.         
	Jermaine Defoe and an own goal from Nigel Reo-Coker in the first half secured the points for Portsmouth, but both teams finished with 10 men after Pompeys Sulley Muntari and Villas Olof Mellberg were sent off late in the game after picking up two yellow cards.         
	West Ham ended a run of three straight 0-4 defeats with their victory. Teenage substitute Freddie Sears headed the winner in the closing stages on his debut.         
	In Bundesliga action, lowly Energie Cottbus stunned Bayern Munich 2-0 on Saturday, handing the league leaders only their second defeat in 24 matches this season.         
	Serbian striker Branko Jelic scored two first-half goals to give the home side their fourth win of the season. Bayern still lead the table, five points ahead of second place Hamburg SV.         
	Jelic put Cottbus in front in the 18th minute, slipping in between defenders Lucio and Daniel van Buyten to tap in an Ervin Skela cross from the right. Jelic doubled the lead in the 38th minute, getting a through ball from Stiven Rivic, out-sprinting Lucio and then calmly beating goalkeeper Oliver Kahn with a fine shot to the far post.         
	Cottbus started the match at the bottom of the table but climbed up to 15th place with the win. Bayerns only other league loss this season was on November 10, a 1-3 defeat at VfB Stuttgart.         
	Schalke 04 recovered from a goal down to beat lowly MSV Duisburg 2-1 on Friday.         
	Germany defender Heiko Westermann got the winner in the 74th minute, firing home from the right with an acrobatic strike after Gerard Asamoahs header came back off the bar. Germany striker Kevin Kuranyi equalised for Schalke on the hour after getting his knee on a low cross from Ivan Rakitic.         
	Duisburg had taken the lead against the Champions League quarter finalists in the 21st minute to stun a sell-out crowd of 61,482. Bulgaria striker Blagoy Georgiev intercepted the ball in midfield and made a superb solo run down the left before beating goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with a fine shot inside the far post.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Indias Ibemcha Salam against DPR Koreas Ri Hyon in Guwahati on Tuesday                           
	Guwahati: Crowd favourite Pranamika Borah went down fighting to Dong Cheng of China in the first round of the lightweight (60kg) category of the 4th ASBC Asian Womens Boxing Championship that got underway at the Karmabir Nabin Chandra Bordoloi Indoor Stadium here on Tuesday.         
	In a keen contest, the Indian put up a spirited fight against her tall Chinese opponent before going down 1-4.         
	Apparently under pressure before a home crowd, Borah of Assam, a bronze and a silver medallist in the 19th and 20th editions of the Ahmet Comert women boxing tournament in Istanbul in 2004 and 2005 respectively, was a bit off colour.         
	After conceding three points in the first round, Borah tried to stage a comeback in the bout gaining a point in the early seconds of the second round.         
	However, the Chinese opponent, who enjoyed the advantage of her height and better reach, took little time to read Borahs strategy and countered with a defensive strategy without going for any more point in the round. Cheng earned her fourth point in the third round.         
	Indias prospects on the first day suffered another setback after Ri Hyon Hwa of DPR Korea outplayed Ibemcha Salam 8-0 in a light welter weight 63 kg bout. Salam, from Manipur, started on a positive note but lost her tempo soon as her opponent took little time in reading the Indians techniques.         
	After opening with a point each, Hwa rallied for two more points in the first round. In the second round, Salam was slow in her footwork as well as attack.

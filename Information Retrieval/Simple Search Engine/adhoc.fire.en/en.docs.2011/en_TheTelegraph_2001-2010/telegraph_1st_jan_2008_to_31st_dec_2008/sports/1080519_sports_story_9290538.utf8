	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders owner Shah Rukh Khan Sunday expressed disappointment at the ICC Anti Corruption Unit (ACU) barring him from going to the team dugout and dressing room in the remaining matches.         
	I like to hang around with the boys. I am very energetic. I am very disappointed that the ICC has stopped me. I dont know the rules. Ill tell only one thing. Nobody dare stop me from coming to Calcutta. Ill be here whenever my team plays a match at the Eden, he said.         
	The ACU officials had cautioned the superstar about going into the dressing room and the team dugout. He was, however, present there during the match and also sat for some time in the visitors dugout.

                                                       BCCI to consult Gary Kirsten
  - Buzz over Greg King following John Gloster out of Team India       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                  John Gloster and Greg King                                 
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) required seven months to find Greg Chappells successor. Its to be seen just how long is taken to appoint the next Team India physio.         
	Its not confirmed, but late on Thursday, The Telegraph learnt that physical trainer Greg King had also decided to follow the path being taken by physio John Gloster.         
	Their contracts come to an end next month and the buzz is that both may have a role in the upcoming and very lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	While King joined at the start of the 2003-04 season, succeeding the tough Adrian le Roux, Gloster began working in early 2005.         
	Assuming King too wont be available after the ongoing tri-series in Australia, the BCCI will actually have to scout for two replacements.         
	Whats confirmed, of course, is that coach-designate Gary Kirsten will be consulted.         
	Gary has to be consulted as, among other things, the physio has to work closely with him. That, in fact, holds true for all members of the support staff, pointed out the BCCIs chief administrative officer, Ratnakar Shetty.         
	Shetty couldnt be contacted after the King-specific development.         
	Speaking on Thursday evening, Shetty added that Kirsten (who takes charge from early next month) could make a short trip to discuss what needs to be done before his first assignment - the home series against the team he once represented, South Africa.         
	The trip should be finalised within a week. Kirsten, incidentally, is coming on board with mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton, who has been working in his academy.         
	The reasons behind Kings decision (again, assuming hes leaving) arent clear, but Gloster may have become fed up with the finger-pointing each time a pacer became unfit.         
	Also, Glosters marrying a Mumbai-based pilot with a private airline next month and Team Indias incredibly hectic schedule would leave him with little time for anything else.         
	The Team India assignment is for a single man, Glosters predecessor, Andrew Leipus, said soon after his marriage (to Sue) broke up.         
	Perhaps, hes dead right.         
	Leipus is back in Adelaide and is entering into a partnership to run a physiotherapy clinic there. Besides, he has begun giving lectures at the University of South Australia.         
	And, yes, Leipus will have a role in the IPL. Ill be working with one of the teams, is all that he was willing to reveal on Thursday afternoon.

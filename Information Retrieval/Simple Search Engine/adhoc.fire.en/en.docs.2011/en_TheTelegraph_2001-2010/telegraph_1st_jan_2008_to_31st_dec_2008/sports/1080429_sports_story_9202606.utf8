The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cristiano Ronaldo seeks home comfort today
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cristiano Ronaldo seeks home comfort today
  - Champions League 
  -   We need solutions, we need results, says Rijkaard                                    Cristiano Ronaldo during practice in Manchester on Sunday. (AFP)		    
	London: The Champions League duel between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi resumes on Tuesday when Manchester United host Barcelona in the second leg of their semi-final at Old Trafford.         
	Messi edged the first round at the Nou Camp last week as Barcelona, enjoying the kings share of possession, had United on the back foot although they might live to rue a lack of goals in the 0-0 draw on their home ground.         
	United fans will be hoping for a more decisive performance from Ronaldo, who could have had a huge impact on the tie from the third minute but missed a penalty and faded to play a lesser role in Uniteds workmanlike, mostly defensive performance.         
	Ronaldo, who has scored 38 goals this season, has not found the net in Uniteds last three games although he was only a substitute in the 1-2 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday that left the two sides level on points at the top of the Premier League with two matches to go.         
	He believes home advantage and the Old Trafford crowd will tilt the balance.         
	Our fans are always fantastic, but over the last month they have been amazing, he told the clubs television channel MUTV. I hope it carries on like that in the remaining games particularly against Barcelona.         
	Barcelona will have to end Uniteds run of 11 straight home wins in European play to reach their second final in three seasons.         
	If we can get past their first line of pressure and play with the same intensity as the first leg, we have a lot of possibilities, said Deco, who scored in the 2-1 victory over Arsenal in the 2006 final.         
	(United) will pressure us more, but we will have more possibilities when we have the ball.         
	Like Alex Ferguson, Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard saw his decision to rest players on Saturday backfire.         
	Barcelona needed a win at Deportivo La Coruna to maintain a glimmer of hope in the Spanish title race. But without a host of stars, including forwards Messi and Samuel Eto, their winless streak was extended to five games with a 0-2 loss.         
	That left Barcelona in third place  a blow to their hopes of finishing runners-up.         
	We need to improve what is not working. We need solutions, we need results, Rijkaard said.         
	Rijkaard gave Deco a 30-minute runout in the second half as he is not fully match fit.         
	The coach said Yaya Toure and Gianluca Zambrotta, who were substituted in the second half, also needed looking after.         
	The visitors also missed the injured Ronaldinho, who is sidelined for the rest of the season. The Brazil playmaker may have played his last game for Barcelona, as he appears to be eyeing a move to another club.         
	Defender Lilian Thuram told reporters: Im sure it will be different in Manchester. I cant explain the difference in attitude but thats just the way it is.         
	Rijkaard is without the suspended Rafael Marquez but captain Carles Puyol returns to reclaim his place in the centre of defence from the Mexican.         
	United have injury concerns over central defender Nemanja Vidic and striker Wayne Rooney though both should be available.         
	It will be a well-balanced game, more open than it was at the Nou Camp and it could go either way, but I think were going into the game with a marvellous chance, Ferguson said. (Barcelona) will play the same system, in the same way, playing that passing carousel where you get dizzy. Its the same all the time and it wont change.         
	After beating Bayern Munich in the 1999 final, Manchester United have twice lost in the semi-finals since then. But Ferguson left Carlos Tevez and Ronaldo on the bench Saturday to ensure they are fresh for Tuesday.         
	Ive got to give my side the best chance possible of getting to a European final, Ferguson said. This football club should have had more success in Europe and I want to give them the best possible chance of doing that.         
	Manchester United will also not let their defeat by Chelsea affect Tuesdays match, according to Ferguson.         
	Everybody is disappointed to lose a game of football but with the incentive of a big game like tomorrow night you put that (defeat) behind you quickly, Ferguson told a news conference.         
	I trust these players and I am happy for those players to represent Manchester United in any shape or form, in any game. I think I am lucky manager to have such good lads. Character-wise they are fantastic.         
	That character is part of Manchester United. It epitomises the kind of player needed to play for Manchester United and I am proud I have got these players representing myself and the club tomorrow night, Ferguson maintained.

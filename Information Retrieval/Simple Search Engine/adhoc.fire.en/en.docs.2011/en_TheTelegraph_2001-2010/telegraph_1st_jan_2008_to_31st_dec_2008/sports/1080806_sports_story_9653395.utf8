	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders will tour Queensland in the last week of September as part of a training and skill development programme. The touring squad will include mostly promising and local players. The teams international stars will not be part of the tour.         
	Knight Riders will play a few practice matches at the end of their fortnight-long trip.         
	That a September trip to Queensland by the Knight Riders was on the cards was reported by The Telegraph on June 1. John Buchanan is the coach of Knight Riders.         
	The touring side will mainly consist of Under-19 players and the locals who could make a difference But this will also be an opportunity for somebody like Cheteswar Pujara, who didnt get enough chance during the Indian Premier League, team director Joy Bhattacharjya said.         
	He, however, said Aakash Chopra wont be available because of his Irani Trophy commitments. As for others, availability wont be a problem even though the Ranji Trophy begins in October-November, Bhattacharjya said.         
	Knight Riders are to play Queensland XI and a Queensland Academy of Sport team as part of their training.

    - Premier division
  - Sunday top scorer             A STAFF REPORTER            Goutam Thakur                                 
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting finished the Sahara CFL Premier Division on 30 points, one behind champions Mohun Bagan, after beating United SC 3-1 at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	With nothing much on the cards for either side and watched on by a handful of supporters, the players took time to get going. Strikers Murithala Ali and Theodore Sunday registered efforts on target for their sides in the first 20 minutes, but neither Tharangachan Tungshang nor Arindam Ghosh in goal were troubled too much. A well flighted cross from Jyothi Kumar saw a flick from Sundays right foot, but Arindams positioning was perfect.         
	At the other end, a cheeky touch from Murithalas right boot saw the ball roll agonisingly wide of Tungshangs far post. Mohammedan Sporting playing in their pristine white away strip took the lead in the 37th minute through Liberian national Sunday. A defence splitting through ball from Okoro set the leagues top scorer racing down the left half of the midfield, outpacing the last defender comfortably. United SC custodian Arindam came charging out narrowing the angle, but Sunday made no mistake in slotting it past him.                     
	United SC came storming back in the second half, with the introduction of Shasti Duley and Soumik Chakraborty adding craft and guile. Murithala Ali turned in the equaliser from inside the 6 yard box in the 51 st minute after a pass from Gouranga Dutta. Minutes later Gouranga set up Soumik inside the penalty box, but the second half substitute blew the chance, striking high and wide.         
	Against the run of play, Shabbir Alis men regained the lead in the 75th minute through the mercurial Sunday. A pass from Jyothi released Sunday, who showed his speed and presence of mind to dodge defender Louice Ebami, before beating Arindam on his near post.         
	Substitute Goutam Thakur increased the lead in the 81st minute, rounding the sprawled keeper. It was Jyothi yet again playing the provider.         
	Shabbir Ali said that he was proud of his teams performance. Together we have proved our critics wrong and I am very happy with my boys. He added: We lost the league against the laws of the game, not on the pitch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We needed to control the controllables: Buchanan 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       We needed to control the controllables: Buchanan 
    - The Knight Riders coach favours super-subs in Twenty20           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan                                 
	Calcutta: Theres little left for the Kolkata Knight Riders to do in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the proverbial last nail in their casket having been hammered by the rain gods on Thursday, but there are lessons to learn and much planning to do for 2009.         
	Coach John Buchanan, for one, has plenty on his plate.         
	Buchanan hasnt engaged in a full-fledged post-mortem as yet (one match remains, on Sunday), but the coach is clear in his thoughts on quite a few issues.         
	That came through when The Telegraph contacted him in New Delhi on Friday morning.               
	The following are excerpts from an interview over the telephone:         
	The Knight Riders being out of the race for honours         
	Were all disappointed We wouldve had a go last night... Whatever the duration of the match... Five5 or Twenty20... However, it was not to be... Wed come to New Delhi with the right thinking and in the right spirit It was a crucial match for the Delhi DareDevils too.         
	His emotions         
	(After a pause) We needed to control the controllables... The weather, of course, wasnt in our hands... Throughout the IPL, we just couldnt string together consistent performances... Couldnt give it our best shot... The semi-finals had been a realistic goal and we shouldve played better throughout... In hindsight, all teams except probably the Rajasthan Royals, feel the same way... But there have been positives... Ashok Dinda and Wriddhiman Saha, for example, will be better after being a part of the IPL for one season... Weve been together as a team for six-seven weeks and know each other much better now... The first year has largely been one of exploration... Looking at the players, the Twenty20 game, the facilities for training... Everything, really...         
	The opening combination having been a big headache         
	Yes, we ended up trying many (seven, in fact) combinations... We always seemed to lose wickets in the first six overs... Next year, Chris Gayle should be available for most if not all of the League, while Brendon McCullum will be there right through... Brendon may not score in every match, thats not guaranteed, but he has an Adam Gilchrist-like impact on the opposition... Gautam Gambhir (Delhi DareDevils) has played very well as an opener in this edition... Getting the opening combination right will be a major priority.         
	Thoughts on next year         
	Well have to raise our level of cricket... Australia could tour Pakistan for a short period and theres talk of the West Indies meeting Bangladesh... That needs to be confirmed... In the next few months, well be clear about the kind of players we need (in 2009) and the options available... There are lessons to learn... The one good thing about the result (failure to move beyond the league stage) is that it has given a big opportunity to look at things that need to be done.         
	Whispers about differences between him and captain Sourav Ganguly         
	Its unfounded... Dont know where it has started... Weve worked together well... One needs a difference of opinion... One needs debate, provided its managed well and benefits the team... Some are probably looking at me and wondering whether the coach is worth his salt...         
	Whether the Knight Riders strategy couldve been different during the first IPL auction, on February 20         
	(Laughs) Just about every franchise may feel that way... We were dealt certain cards... We chose certain cards... Were probably a bit disappointed how some of the cards played out.         
	Buzz that trading in players would be allowed next year itself         
	At this stage, nobody is quite clear... Thats one of the questions well be asking the IPL... Its a busy time for them right now, but well ask and get an answer... Theres also talk of allowing a maximum of five and not four overseas players in the XI...         
	Thoughts on the way forward, generally         
	Id like the IPL to allow super-subs... Perhaps 14 or 15 players in every match, which would enable the best batters and the best bowlers to be fielded... Well be having an internal meeting after Sunday and well put our thoughts down on paper... Theres a case for playing the Twenty20 a little differently.         
	The proposed Knight Riders Academy         
	I expect it to be up and running in some form or the other by October, before the start of the next season locally... Once in place, some of the things should fall into place.         
	Local talent         
	Look, somebody like young Rohan Banerji is very talented, but Twenty20 is a power game and he doesnt have that build... The Academy will help him and others like him.         
	The No.1 performance from the Knight Riders         
	Without a doubt McCullums 158 not out in the opener (against the Bangalore Royal Challengers)... As a moment, the opening ceremony in Bangalore was spectacular and it was nice to be a part of history.         
	Biggest disappointment         
	The top-order not coming good throughout the IPL...         
	Finally, the team most likely to win the IPL         
	The Rajasthan Royals look hot favourites... Once the semi-finals stage is reached, though, the mental process of the teams will be put to test the most... The huge prize money, the adulation that awaits the winner... These are factors which too will come into play.

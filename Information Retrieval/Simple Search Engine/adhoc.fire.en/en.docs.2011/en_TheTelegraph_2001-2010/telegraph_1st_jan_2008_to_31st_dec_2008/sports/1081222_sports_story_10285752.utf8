	Jeev, who netted $1.4 million in prize money to clinch the overall title for second time in three years, said he could handle the pressure of the big events.         
	Winning twice in three years is special. It has given me a lot of confidence, Singh said at the Volvo Masters of Asia in Bangkok on Sunday.

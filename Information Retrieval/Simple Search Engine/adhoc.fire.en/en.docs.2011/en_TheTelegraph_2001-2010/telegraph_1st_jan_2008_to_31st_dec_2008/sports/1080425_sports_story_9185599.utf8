                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ricky enjoys playing the mentor
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: When most of his Kolkata Knight Riders teammates preferred staying in the cool of their hotel premises, Australia captain Ricky Ponting chose to sweat it out under the scorching April sun at the Eden for the scheduled training session.         
	After a couple of hours fielding, batting and throwing himself around, the 33-year old Australian realised that it was too hot and humid out there.         
	Oh its too hot today, Ponting said, coming out of the ground after offering some tips to Bengal skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla.         
	It feels nice when you have young players in your dressing room. They are so enthusiastic and keep on asking questions and always trying to learn things, Ponting said when asked about his teammates.         
	I feel the youngsters are improving a lot It feels great to share my experience with them, he added.         
	On the teams game plan as and when he and New Zealander Brendon McCullum return home for national duty, Ponting said: I cant help it. We both will have to go. But David Hussey will be here I think there will be no problem.         
	Both Ponting and McCullum are supposed to leave after the hosts play their fourth IPL match against Mumbai Indians at home on Tuesday.         
	Coach Buchanan praised Pontings tiring effort.         
	Going into a series, Ponting does need to play well. The last game he had very little time and he is trying hard now, Buchanan said.         
	Ponting, who is going through a lean patch, said: Johns tips are always helpful. Im working very hard and its good to get back to working with him I need to get back among runs he said.         
	A sweating Buchanan, when asked why he chose to train in this unbearable heat, said: I want the boys to get a feel of the heat. There are six more games to be played here and the temperature will soar even more  So they need to adapt.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumble to Sourav: We learnt to win overseas from you
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kumble to Sourav: We learnt to win overseas from you
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly at a felicitation in Nagpur on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Nagpur: Sachin Tendulkar got the loudest applause, Anil Kumble struck the most emotional note and V.V.S. Laxman remembered to thank the media too, but its Sourav Ganguly who got the biggest compliment.         
	Enjoy the last four days (of Test cricket)... Youve been fantastic and its under you that we learnt to win Tests abroad, is how Kumble saluted Sourav during the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)-organised felicitation of the Big Four on Thursday evening.         
	The function was at the VCA Recreation Club, which is on the premises housing Indias newest and finest cricket stadium. Its a small distance away from the city, in Jamtha, but has a hundred pluses.         
	While Sachin and Laxman got felicitated for scoring 12,000 Test runs and appearing in 100 Tests, respectively, the just-retired Kumble and the about-to-retire Sourav were honoured for serving Indian cricket with such distinction.         
	Giants, is how the city-based BCCI (and VCA) president, Shashank Manohar, described the Big Four.         
	Sachin also spoke very highly of Sourav, lauding his grit and determination and his desire to play for India. The senior-most pro didnt stop at that.         
	Having been together for so long, we know each others game so well... Souravs contribution has been terrific... Occasionally, he has tried to teach me some Bengali as well!         
	Sourav, who is looking good for another big score (in the fourth and final Test against Australia), ended his address by saying: Over the past 12-13 years Ive made good friends and made some enemies, but it was all for the good of Indian cricket and, hopefully, youve enjoyed walking the path with me.         
	Asked if the evening had left him somewhat emotional, Indias most successful Test captain told The Telegraph: No... Its nice to be recognised, but Im normal.         
	Kumble, of course, stole the show. Clad in a suit and not the India blue, he had to correct himself at the start of his thank you speech.         
	Having just retired, you couldnt blame him, though.         
	...And my colleagues... Former colleagues, sorry... Its always tough when you know the time is up... It was very hard for me today to watch the match (first day of the final Test) from the Presidents Box.         
	Kumble mentioned that hed been absolutely overwhelmed by the messages hed been receiving, from across the country, after he suddenly decided to retire.         
	To Sachin, among other things, he said: Youve had the challenge to prove everybody right, I had the challenge to prove everybody wrong...         
	Thats definitely one for posterity.         
	Incidentally, Sachin and Kumble felt that Laxman hadnt got his due. The team, though, has known your worth and youre worth your weight in gold, is how Kumble put it.         
	Laxman couldve got a hundred, on Thursday, but fell in the 60s. The former captains appreciation would surely have lessened the disappointment.         
	Both Kumble and Sourav, by the way, hoped that Team India would soon be No.1 in Test cricket. In fact, theyre confident that the goal would be reached.         
	In the ongoing series, at least, the right moves have been made. Fingers crossed, then.         
	Footnote: Kumble is returning home to Bangalore for a family function, but will be back here on Sunday, the series penultimate day.

	London: Look out London, Michael Phelps is coming to the 2012 Games and hes thinking about adding even more events to his repertoire.         
	The Beijing Olympics and Phelps eight gold medals are still making headlines, but the good news for his rivals is that London will be his last Olympics. And the bad news? He could be taking part in even more events.         
	I am looking forward to trying some new events, some events Ive never really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded, Phelps said, adding hes never competed in a backstroke event at a major international meet or in the 100m freestyle.         
	Only a few swimmers will be breathing a sigh of relief after Phelps confirmed his future plans. No breaststroke, no distance swimming, no water open swimming, Phelps said. At least those guys will still be my friends.         
	The only other swimmers likely to be pleased by the 23-year-olds comments are those young enough to compete in 2016.         
	Ive never wanted to go beyond 30, Phelps said. I may go a few years beyond the Olympics. I said to my coach, dont get any ideas because I dont want to compete beyond 30, and he said, thats good because I dont want to coach you past the age of 30.         
	Speaking in London, where he is taking part in the handover celebrations, Phelps said the changes suggested by coach Bob Bowman could help rejuvenate him mentally and physically after what he described as the most gruelling period of his life.         
	Bob said to me that hes going to take everything hes done coaching me and throw it out the door and try something completely different, just to see how it works, Phelps said. Well try a bunch of new things. If were successful, great. If not, we can go back to what weve been doing.         
	Phelps said he was enjoying his celebrity status, but deflected suggestions that the rock star treatment could distract him from being as dominant in 2012 as he was in 2008.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer is now a thinking cricketer, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                             Zaheer is now a thinking cricketer, says Dhoni
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni receives the trophy at the PCA Stadium in Mohali on Tuesday. (AFP)                           
	Mohali: Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday described Man of the Series Zaheer Khan as the bowler who has transformed himself into a thinking cricketer.         
	Talking to the reporters after winning the series, Dhoni said: Hes (Zaheer Khan) excellent. The execution of the plan is important, and hes very clear in his thoughts.         
	He plans against each and every batsman and when you go in the middle, hes ready with his plans. I feel he has transformed himself into a thinking cricketer.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On why he did not declare at lunch on Tuesday         
	We were leading the series 1-0 and it wasnt 100 per cent sure that if we put them in to chase, wed get them out and win the series 2-0. We saw the importance of Gauti (Gautam Gambhir) and Yuvrajs (Singh) contribution in the match. We wanted them to score their centuries. One more reason was that when we started batting yesterday (Monday) evening, we were not sure about the fog. If we had gone after the bowlers right from the start and lost wickets thinking that it would be a 70-over game on the last day and found that we had 98 overs then we would have been in a difficult situation.         
	On Man of the Series Zaheer Khan         
	Hes excellent. The execution of the plan is important, and hes very clear in his thoughts. He plans against each and every batsman and when you go in the middle, hes ready with his plans. I feel he has transformed himself into a thinking cricketer. He watches the batsmen and immediately decides that this is the area Id love to bowl to him. If that doesnt work, hes always ready with plan B.         
	On the series         
	Id like to thank the England team for coming and playing in India. Theyve proved that India is not an unsafe place. We had good cricket over the series.         
	On Englands fight-back         
	Id said at the start of the series that England are a good bowling side. With Freddie (Flintoff) coming in at seven, they can play with five specialist bowlers, and that gives any team an edge..         
	On whether it should have been a three-match series         
	Its good to have at least a three-Test series, because there are chances of coming back into the series. In a two-game series, if you lose the first Test, it gets very difficult to come back, especially if its an away series, because home teams will take advantage and prepare pitches to suit themselves. So I think a three-Test series is good, five becomes a bit too much.                     
	On India hoping to become the No. 1 team         
	Were not really thinking about it. We just want to play good cricket. We have plans for the opposition were facing, and the execution of the plans has been brilliant so far and well look to stick to that. Thats the thing that will take care of our rankings.         
	Whether Yuvraj is the right replacement for Sourav Ganguly         
	I was saying this for a long time, hes (Yuvraj) a very talented player. But at the same time, its not about whether he can replace Sourav Or whos better and whether hes the ideal replacement or not. Hes Yuvraj Singh and Id like to talk about him as Yuvraj Singh. I dont think he also looks at himself at the guy wholl fill in the shoes of Sourav Ganguly.         
	On whether Yuvraj will cement his place in the next 14-15 innings         
	I think hell cement his place before that.         
	On Yuvraj being called a pie-chucker         
	Its good to have a pie-chucker if he can dismiss Pietersen so many times. Id love to have more pie-chuckers who have their own bunnies!         
	On Man of the Match Gautam Gambhir         
	Both Viru (Virender Sehwag) and Gauti give us a platform to capitalise on a good start and put up a big score. They complement each other, they play their shots, they run well between the wickets. Of course, there was a run out in this innings.         
	On his plan after the cancellation of the Pak series         
	Rest!         
	On Rahul Dravids return to form         
	Of course, its great. Next were going to New Zealand and there the ball will be doing a bit because the conditions favour the seam bowlers. So yes, its good to see Rahul Dravid among the runs.         
	On his own bowling today         
	They pushed me to bowl!         
	On his approach to captaincy         
	Im captain on the field and thats it. Off the field, Im just a part of the side. Theres no trick to captaincy, youve just got to read the game well.

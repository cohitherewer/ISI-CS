                                                   India, Lanka fined
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India and Sri Lanka have been fined for maintaining slow over rates during their tri-series match in Adelaide on Tuesday, according to an ICC release.         
	Match Referee Jeff Crowe imposed the fines after Mahendra Singh Dhonis side was ruled to be one over and Mahela Jayawardenes team was found to be two overs short of their targets when time allowances were taken into consideration.         
	In accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct, players are fined five per cent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount.         
	As such, Dhoni was fined 10 per cent of his match fee while Jayawardena was fined 20 per cent.

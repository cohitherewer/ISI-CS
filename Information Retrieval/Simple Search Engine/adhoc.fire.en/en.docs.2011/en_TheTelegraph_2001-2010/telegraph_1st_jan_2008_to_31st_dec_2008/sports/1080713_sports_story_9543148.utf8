                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ric: IOA owes me a lot of money
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT              Ric Charlesworth                      
	New Delhi: Ric Charlesworth, who resigned as technical advisor of Indian hockey recently, has dismissed allegations that he demanded more money to continue in his post.         
	In an email to The Telegraph on Saturday, the legendary Australian coach, who is currently in Melbourne, said those making such allegations are dishonest.         
	On the contrary, the coach said that his employers in India owe him a lot of money.         
	On Friday, sources in the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said that Charlesworth asked for a huge hike in salary before submitting his resignation. Mohammed Aslam Khan, the IOA ad-hoc committee member, also said that the Australian coach was of no use to Indian hockey.         
	Charlesworth said: I will not comment on these allegations and speculation but would be pleased to know who said what Given that I am owed much by my employers in India, the allegations are extremely unfair as well as dishonest.         
	I am aware of much speculation about my future in India though I have no detail or official communication from SAI or the IOA and I am unwilling to comment on media speculation. My employers are well aware of my position and what I am doing.         
	Charlesworth said that he would be back in two weeks but made it clear that he wont accept the role of an adviser.         
	My role as technical adviser in India entailed me to make recommendations in Indian hockey. I do not believe there is much more I can do in an advisory role in India, he said.

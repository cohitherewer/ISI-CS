	London: A profligate Sania Mirza squandered four matchpoints to crash out of the womens singles of the Wimbledon championships as she lost her second-round match 0-6, 6-4, 7-9 to qualifier Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez here on Thursday.         
	Sania, seeded 32nd, wasted three match points in the 13th game of the third set, which allowed her opponent to stage a comeback and the Spaniard did it in style, backing her game by powerful service and intelligent tennis at net. Sania took long to get into her rhythm and within the first 21 minutes, the Indian had lost the first set without managing a single game.         
	The Indian then got her act together as she negotiated the attacking net game of Sanchez through some wonderful lobs. The second set, which again started on a dismal note as she dropped her serve, was remarkable for Sania as she displayed ample determination to stay in the hunt through improved tactics. Sania broke Sanchez in the sixth and 10th games to draw parity in the match.         
	Sania made a good start in the final set as she went up 4-2 by breaking Sanchez in the second and sixth games, but she nullified all the good work by handing two breakpoints in the seventh game after missing easy shots. Next two games went on serve and Sania earned her first matchpoint in the 10th game when a Sanchez forehand sailed long. The Spaniard saved it through a brilliant forehand winner and followed it with another to ward off the threat.         
	Sanchez then saved three more matchpoints in the 13th game as Sania could not convert any of the chances as she preferred to hit hard rather than apply intelligence.

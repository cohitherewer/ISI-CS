                                                   McGrath: Kumble remark surprising

           
	Sydney: Former Australian paceman Glenn McGrath has come to the defence of under-fire captain Ricky Ponting and the rest of the team, saying the world champions played hard but fair cricket. 
    
	McGrath also expressed surprise at Indian captain Anil Kumbles comment that only one team (India) played in the spirit of the game during the Sydney Test. 
    
	Anils a great guy and quite reserved so I find it quite surprising that he would come out and say that, McGrath said. 
    
	From an Australian point of view, I know the way the guys play and I have total respect for every guy that pulls on a baggy green. The Australians play it hard and fair, the most successful paceman in Test history said. 
    
	McGrath said nobody should question Pontings integrity and cited an incident in the Indian first innings when he made it clear he had taken a catch off Rahul Dravids bat on the bounce. 
    
	If they want to look at his integrity they only need to look at the first innings. That catch (of Dravid), he could have caught it, but he was unsure and he said it  end of story. 
    
	The several umpiring blunders at the SCG, particularly the performance of West Indian Steve Bucknor, had come in for stinging criticism but McGrath said the teams should learn to take the rough with the smooth. 
    
	Umpires have a tough thing to do. Theres only eight on the (ICC Elite) panel, there should be more. At the end of the day they call it the way they see it, which is the way its always been, he said. 
    
	Some days you are going to get bad decisions, some days youll get good ones. You cant pick and choose when you want to complain about it. 
    
	Adam Gilchrist also dismissed Kumbles criticism about the lack of sportsman spirit among the hosts in Sydney. 
    
	Though I have not seen his comments or heard him, but thats what I have been told about. I think thats not right, an unrepentant Gilchrist said. 
    
	Definitely we dont feel so and we are not sorry about anything. I do not know what he (Kumble) is referring to, Gilchrist told a television channel.

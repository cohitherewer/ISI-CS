	Calcutta: Call it the John Buchanan Doctrine if you wish, but the eight points prominently listed in the Team Room of the Kolkata Knight Riders at The Sonar do give an insight into what goes into the making of a successful outfit.         
	Significantly, the list includes respecting tradition and not compromising on ethics.         
	Buchanan, who had an amazing record during his years (late 1999 to early 2007) as the Australia coach, has actually kept it simple.         
	The eight points are on one of the two boards in the Team Room. The other board has details specific to the Knight Riders game plan in the ongoing Indian Premier League.         
	At the very top of the Doctrine is skill, followed by leadership (from all, incidentally), tradition, hard work, ethics (explained as the right way), selflessness (specifically, investing in mates), honesty (as also trust and respect) and learning how to do better.         
	The path is quite clear Theres nothing thats complicated, somebody who has been working with Buchanan told The Telegraph.         
	After a splendid start in the League, the Knight Riders lost four on the trot but have returned to winning ways.         
	Buchanan, of course, would like the Sourav Gangulys to get better.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We have a brilliant opportunity: Kumble
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We have a brilliant opportunity: Kumble
                      
	Vadodara: Twice they let Australia off the hook in recent past but Indias Test captain Anil Kumble hopes to buck the trend this time with the potent cocktail of skill and experience in the ranks.         
	Kumble, along with coach Gary Kirsten, was addressing reporters here Tuesday as the Rest of India captain on the eve of the sides Irani Cup tie against Delhi. But almost inevitably, more questions were asked about the four-match Test series against Australia and the veteran spinner too was free and frank with his views.         
	Looking ahead to the series, Kumble rued that both in 2004 at home and last year Down Under India came close to halt the Aussies before wilting in the final stages. But with a relatively inexperienced Australian side facing them, Kumble says its time to make amends.         
	Last year, we came close to equal, if not win, the Test series in Australia and in 2004, we lost the Chennai Test on the last day because of rain. But this time I think we have got a brilliant opportunity, Kumble said.         
	This Australian side is low on experience. I think our vast experience and skill will be to our advantage and we have to back it with the right result at the end of the series. All players had adequate rest and the perfect preparation for such a series and we are looking forward to it, Kumble said.         
	Kumble said he was not losing sleep over the middle order, which looked brittle against Sri Lanka.         
	It was a one-off series in which our batters didnt perform well. Against Australia, the middle order has done exceptionally well and Im expecting it to be no exception this time too, Kumble said.         
	The skipper was not unduly worried about Sachin Tendulkars elbow injury either, which has forced the Mumbaikar to opt out of Irani Cup.         
	Sachin needed time to get 100 per cent fit for the Test series. He is a great player and has done exceptionally well against Australia, he said. (PTI)

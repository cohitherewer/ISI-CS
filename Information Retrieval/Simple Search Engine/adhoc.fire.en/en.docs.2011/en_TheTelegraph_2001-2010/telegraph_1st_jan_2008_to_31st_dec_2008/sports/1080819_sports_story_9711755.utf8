The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We misread the wicket, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We misread the wicket, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                                  M.S. Dhoni      
	Dambulla: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni admitted to have misread the wicket and gave credit to the Sri Lankan fast bowlers after going down by eight wickets in the first ODI on Monday.         
	The following are excerpts:         
	On what went wrong         
	To start with, we misread the wicket a bit. We did not think it would seam or swing that much. Of course, since the breeze was strong, we expected it to swing throughout the day which it did. There was a fair bit in the wicket to start off. The Sri Lankan bowlers bowled really well. They got the first two batsmen out, it was not like the batsmen played bad shots and got out. Credit goes to their fast bowlers, they got wickets.         
	Later on, Mendis put the pressure. The only thing we were doing was to catch up.         
	Handling Murali and Mendis         
	Murali and Mendis are different bowlers. Murali can turn the ball on any sort of wicket, he loves Sri Lankan wickets. Even when he bowls fast, he gets some purchase out of the wicket. If it was any other spinner apart from Murali and Mendis, they wouldnt have got so much turn. There was a bit and when you are in a good position, you can exploit that.         
	On the mistakes India committed         
	It is important to learn because mistakes do happen. Everyone makes mistakes. So long as you learn from them, your graph and the teams graph goes upwards. It is also important to forget a defeat.         
	Sehwags injury         
	He was the batsman in top form. Gautam also got out early. We lost the top two performers of the Test series. But thats the way it is. You never know, thats the way it goes in cricket. You cant really think about the guys you are missing. Instead, you must fill that space. Thats the only way the team can win.         
	On Ajantha Mendiss bowling         
	Its difficult to pick him. He is a very different bowler. Even if you pick him, by the time you realise what ball it is, it gets really late to play a big shot. Nowadays you will see batsmen who can play him, but in one-day cricket it is not only about playing him. You have to rotate the strike because you dont want a bowler to end up with 10 overs for 20 runs.         
	Its not just about playing him out but you have also got to score runs. We will need to find a way by which we can rotate the strike, if not play big shots.         
	On the lack of partnerships in the Indian innings         
	Cricket is a game of partnerships. Whatever format you are playing, the longer the partnership you have, the better it is for the side. You dont always get it. We never really had any sort of partnership.         
	On the Indian seamers         
	Against Sri Lanka, seam bowlers have been successful. In Australia also, we saw Munaf being successful against them. He was up to the mark, he was bowling at decent pace, hitting the right areas. He is putting more effort in the fielding as well, his throwing has improved.         
	What exactly is mysterious about Mendiss bowling         
	The trouble is in picking him, I have not seen any bowler like this. He is an unusual bowler. The only option right now is to play more and more of him, thats the only way of getting better.

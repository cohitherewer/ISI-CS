  - Harbhajans six-wicket haul helps visitors snatch 37-run lead in 1st innings                       
	Galle: A spirited India tilted the balance of the second cricket Test in their favour by taking an overall lead of 237 runs to push Sri Lanka on the backfoot at close on the third day here on Saturday.         
	The visitors first dismissed the hosts for 292 to snatch a vital 37-run lead with Harbhajan Singh (six for 102) playing a key role and then gave a solid batting display to reach a comfortable 200 for four when play was called off early, due to bad light.         
	After two days of tough fight, the Indians have now put themselves in a position to push for a series-levelling victory after being trounced by an innings and 239 runs in the first Test in Colombo.         
	Sourav Ganguly and the stylish V.V.S. Laxman were at the crease at stumps without having opened their accounts on an absorbing days play that saw nine wickets fall.         
	With two full days left in the match, the Indians will now seek to take a substantial lead and hope to polish off the islanders quickly in the fourth innings when the track at the Galle International Stadium was expected to deteriorate.         
	The day unfolded perfectly for the tourists as Harbhajan completed his 22nd five-wicket haul to bring Sri Lankas first innings to an end just at the stroke of lunch. Captain Anil Kumble, who bagged three wickets, ably supported the off-spinner.         
	Mahela Jayawardene was the top scorer for the home team with a responsible 86 as they lost their remaining five wickets for the addition of 77 runs.         
	The Indians again got off to a solid start with the dashing Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir putting on 90 runs for the opening wicket to provide the platform for a big innings.         
	Sehwag scored a brisk 50 off 52 balls before falling to paceman Chaminda Vaas with Tillekeratne Dilshan taking a smart catch at the cover region.         
	Gambhir (74) and Dravid, who has not been in the best of forms, took the score to 144 before Ajantha Mendis struck for the hosts by castling Gambhir with a gem of a delivery.         
	The Indians could have been in a more commanding position had they not lost Dravid (44) and Sachin Tendulkar (31). The experienced Vaas accounted for Tendulkar as he induced an edge and Prasanna Jayawardene made no mistake behind the stumps.         
	Dravid was then adjudged leg before to Muttiah Muralidharan by the third umpire after the hosts opted to call for a review. Dravid appeared disappointed as he walked back to the pavilion.

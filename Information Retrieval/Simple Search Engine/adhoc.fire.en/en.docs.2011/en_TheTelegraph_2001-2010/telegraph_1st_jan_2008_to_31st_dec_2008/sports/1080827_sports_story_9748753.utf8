The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis Hamilton appeals for a faster car
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lewis Hamilton appeals for a faster car
    - FOCUS ON WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP           [+uc('Edward Gorman   THE TIMES, LONDON')+]            Lewis Hamilton                                 
	Lewis Hamilton has appealed to his team to provide him with a faster car as he attempts to win his first world title in his second season in Formula One.         
	The 23-year-old drove an incident-free race in Sundays European Grand Prix in Valencia to finish second behind Felipe Massa, in a Ferrari, a result that leaves the Briton leading the Brazilian at the head of the drivers championship by six points with six races to come.         
	However, Hamilton is concerned that in the past two races  in Valencia and Hungary, the Italian cars have shown superior race pace to his McLaren Mercedes, describing them as bloody quick.         
	My car is quick but their car is quicker, he said on Monday. We dropped everyone at Valencia. It was just Felipe and me in a completely different world, but he was still just edging away from me and I could do nothing about it. It is something I am constantly telling the team that we need to fix  there are certain things that we need to fix and they are working on it. It probably wont be fixed for the next race  it might not be fixed until next years car.         
	Hamilton also spoke revealingly about the contrast in his approach this year to last and admitted that in his historic rookie season, which ended with him losing the title race by one point to Kimi Raikkonen, of Ferrari, at the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix  his motivation was to show everyone that he could win races and to prove wrong the sceptics who predicted he would be slower than his teammate at the time, Fernando Alonso, the former world champion from Spain.         
	Last year I meant business, Hamilton said.         
	I was there to tell everyone that I am not half a second slower than Fernando as some people said I would be.         
	Hamilton explained that he wanted to prove that he was no No. 2 driver, whoever he was up against. Put me next to Michael Schumacher and I am not No. 2 to him  thats what I was there last year to do, to show how good I am, he said.         
	I did that, but this year I want to top that using my mind. My only focus is winning the World Championship.         
	I dont know, if you can see but I feel a lot stronger than I was this time last year. I think it is just maturity, knowing what you need.         
	Last year I would have been at this race (in Valencia) and I would have just driven my heart out not really knowing, not really thinking exactly why. I just wanted to win and was not thinking how the points were going to work.         
	During the race on Sunday, I could see Felipe was pulling away. I was pushing my a*** off but I also thought to myself, He is pulling away even though I am driving my a*** off. The only way to do even better is to push even more but that causes risks of crashing so it would have been silly of me to have pushed too much, crashed and lost eight points. It was better for us to be smart and take the points.         
	There will be another time when I get the chance to take the points off him. Last year that would have played against me. I think this year that is not going to happen.         
	Although the Ferraris may have the edge in terms of speed, the Scuderia have suffered two engine failures in successive races  one for Massa in Hungary and a second one on Sunday for Raikkonen, whose power plant produced a billowing plume of white smoke 11 laps from the end.

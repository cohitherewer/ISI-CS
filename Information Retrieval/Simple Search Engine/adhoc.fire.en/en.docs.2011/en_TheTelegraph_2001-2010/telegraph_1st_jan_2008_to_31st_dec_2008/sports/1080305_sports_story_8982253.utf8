The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We were outplayed: Ponting 
                                                   We were outplayed: Ponting 
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Brisbane: Ricky Ponting admitted on Tuesday that India had outplayed them in all departments. The Australia captain said in the post match press conference on Tuesday that it has been a disappointing way to end the summer.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Disappointing way to end a long summer         
	Its been a long, tough summer. We dominated the series all through until the final. Its pretty disappointing.         
	Bowlers performance         
	The bowlers were outstanding in the first half of the tournament When youre batting at No. 3, you need to take a responsibility But Im guilty as much as any.         
	Were you relieved to have lost in the final         
	No. Im not. Wed have loved to be going to Adelaide on Wednesday. Get away from cricket for a little while. Not just because of controversies. Its been hard cricket... very tough cricket Im sure the guys would be looking forward to having a couple of weeks break.         
	Personal form         
	I thought that 100 was going to change things around for me. I sort of was back to where I started again. When youre in a bit of a slump, as Ive been through the one-day series, it highlights what a fine line it is. Where you are in a slump, you tend to get out in all sorts of ways. Any mistake you make, you pay for it.         
	Rating the Indian team         
	India thoroughly deserved to win They outplayed us thoroughly Sachin set both games up for them Their experienced players stood up Rohit Sharma looked good in Sydney, Ishant has come up leaps and bound They have a lot of talent in this squad         
	Did fatigue play any role         
	Its actually been interesting I was talking about it with coach and chairman of selectors Weve changed only two players in Tests to ODIs Weve had a more changes in the past.         
	Indias policy         
	They went with their youth players for this tour (Sourav) Ganguly was left out and I was surprised But the yosunger players have stood up...         
	Does Australia need some fresh blood         
	The reason this group has been together is that theyre outstanding Times gonna come when players are going to retire Most senior players still have the skills that are required Inevitably there will be changes

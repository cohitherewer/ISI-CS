The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yousufs plea
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yousufs plea
                      
	Karachi: Disappointed at not being able to participate in the million dollar Indian Premier League (IPL), Pakistan batsman, Mohammed Yousuf on Tuesday urged the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to resolve his legal dispute with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	Yousuf was barred from playing in the cash rich IPL due to a legally binding order from an arbitrator in Mumbai.         
	The arbitrator ruled in favour of the ICL, which had filed a petition against the Pakistan player for illegally terminating his contract with them and signing up for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)-backed IPL.         
	Everyone knows about this issue. The ball is now in the PCB chairmans court, a disappointed Yousuf said.           (PTI)

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna said on Saturday that he was ready to play on all three days of the Davis Cup tie against Uzbekistan, to be played here from February 8 to 10. 
    
	With captain Leander Paes still nursing an injury, Bopanna may feature in both singles and doubles. While Prakash Amritraj and Bopanna will play singles, the Bangalore boy is also expected to partner Mahesh Bhupathi in the doubles. 
    
	I am fit to play on all three days. The confidence is there. I just need to deliver on court, Bopanna, who arrived in the capital on Saturday, said.

	Are you happy with the way Deccan Chargers played today?         
	Yeah, I am pleased with the way my boys played.         
	The pitch         
	It was not suited for any form of the game. It was a shocking wicket... In the Twenty20 format you expect high scores. Though the match was exciting in the end, it was tough for the batsmen to go for their shots.         
	Is the character of Eden wicket changing?         
	Yes, definitely the character is changing. Both during the Ranji match and the Test against Pakistan last year, the wicket was slow. The wicket were getting here is not expected from Eden.         
	Did the power cut affect your teams concentration         
	Yeah it did affect our game... The momentum was towards us and the bowlers were in great rhythm. But when the game resumed David Hussey played a responsible innings that proved costly for us.         
	The positives from the match         
	I am not depressed losing the match. We played as an unit and the team effort was clear while batting and bowling. The played we played was absolutely all right.         
	Pragyan Ojhas bowling         
	Ojha was amazing He bowled absolutely the way I expected. He is really a good prospect         
	Do you feel that some more runs on board would have helped you?         
	We were bowled out without playing the full overs It was important to play the entire quota.

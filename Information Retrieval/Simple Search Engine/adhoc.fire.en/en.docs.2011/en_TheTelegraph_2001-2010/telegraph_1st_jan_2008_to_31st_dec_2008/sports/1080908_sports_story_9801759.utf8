            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: The totalisator (tote) and the other electronic systems, which were damaged by lightning on Saturday, have been restored, according to an RCTC press release on Sunday. The club was forced to conduct the Pune races inter-venue without the tote which went through various tests on Sunday to the full satisfaction of the support staff and the senior RCTC executives who put in untiring efforts on Saturday night to set the things right. Only Bookmakers operated on Sunday.          
	Hard work has paid off. The normal functioning of the audio, video and the totalisator betting will be resumed from Monday. We will conduct the Hyderabad and Delhi inter-venue on Monday and Tuesday as per our original schedule, said Boman Parakh, secretary RCTC.

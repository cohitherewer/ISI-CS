The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni has a good team: Sachin
                                                                                                                                                                                           Dhoni has a good team: Sachin
                                        Sachin      
	Mussoorie: Mahendra Singh Dhonis leadership earned him accolades from senior teammate Sachin Tendulkar on Thursday. He said he was a good captain, adding he had a good team at his disposal to bring about the desired result.         
	Tendulkar, who is here for a vacation with wife Anjali and two children, told reporters that apart from Dhonis captaincy, it was a great team effort which saw India finish the year on a high.         
	Dhoni is obviously a good captain. But a good captain needs a good team. Obviously his captaincy is good but the teams performance, its collective effort, is essential for a captain.         
	A team never wins by the performance of one or two players only. When the entire team performs, we get good results, Tendulkar said.         
	Early in his captaincy, Dhoni has enjoyed stellar success in all three formats of the game. The star stumper led India to Twenty20 World Cup triumph, a ODI tri-series victory in Australia and is yet to lose a Test match as captain.         
	Dhoni has won four out of the five Tests he led India in, the last of which was against England in Mohali earlier this week, which ended in a draw.         
	Tendulkar said both good leadership and some sterling performance by the team made it a memorable year for Indian cricket.         
	Throughout the year, our players have performed. It has been a good team effort and good leadership, he said.         
	Looking ahead, Tendulkar said the team would now strive to maintain the high standard it set this year. We had a great series against England when all players performed very well.         
	We will try to maintain the form we have displayed throughout the year. The team has set some targets which we shall try to achieve, he said.         
	Tendulkar also lavished praise on opener Gautam Gambhir, and said the left-hander has established himself as a key member of the side.         
	Gambhir has batted very well throughout the year. He has shown the kind of form that gives nightmares to the opposition.         
	 He has shown great consistency, he attacked when attack was required, defended when defence was required. He has displayed solid technique and capacity to make huge scores. His teammates knew his capability, now the whole world knows about it, Tendulkar said.         
	Gambhir had a stupendous year that saw him break into the top-10 in the ICC Test Rankings for batsmen. The diminutive Delhi batsman scored more than 1000 runs in 2008, including three hundreds in his last five Tests.         
	Asked about the cancellation of Indias Pakistan tour, following the Mumbai terror attacks, Tendulkar said on such occasions, cricket should take a backseat.         
	It is a decision by the government and we respect that decision. The attack on Mumbai was very unfortunate, so many people lost their lives in it.         
	This tragedy is far bigger than any cricket tour or sport. Those who have lost their loved ones can never be compensated, he said.         
	Tendulkar also asked his critics to stop speculating about his retirement till they hear from him on it.         
	It will only be right for me to speak about retirement if and when I feel the time is right. Its not for others to speak or speculate on the subject, he said.         
	I have been subjected to such questions for long now. Let everyone wait till I have something to say on the matter, said Tendulkar.         
	Cancellation of the Pakistan tour allows the Indian cricketers to have more rest before they tour New Zealand, and Tendulkar was optimistic that the team would continue to do well on the other side of the break.         
	For the next month and a half, we would be free of international engagements. There would be domestic ties and then getting together in time to prepare for the tour to New Zealand. Hopefully, our good form would continue next year, he said. (PTI)

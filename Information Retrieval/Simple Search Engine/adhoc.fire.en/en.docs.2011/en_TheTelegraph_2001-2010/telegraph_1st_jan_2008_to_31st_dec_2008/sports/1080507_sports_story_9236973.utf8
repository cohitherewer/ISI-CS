    - HARBHAJAN-SREESANTH SLAPGATE DRAMA CONTINUES                 Sreesanth after the incident                           
	Mumbai: Sudhir Nanavati, the BCCI-appointed commissioner who is investigating the slapping row between Harbhajan Singh and Sreesanth, said on Tuesday that the video footage of the incident had left him stunned.         
	What I saw (in the footage) was shocking, but it has made my job easier, he told reporters after viewing footage of the incident that took place after an IPL match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab on April 25.         
	Nanavati, a lawyer from Ahmedabad, viewed the footage at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) headquarters with IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah and joint secretary M.P. Pandove.         
	He will submit his report to BCCI president Sharad Pawar on Monday.         
	Nanavati took Match Referee Farokh Engineers statement and will also speak to Mumbai Indians coach Lalchand Rajput, who was allegedly standing behind Harbhajan when he slapped Sreesanth.         
	He has already spoken to umpire Amish Saheba, who was suspended for a match after criticising Sreesanths behaviour in an interview. Saheba has, however, denied saying anyth- ing.         
	On Monday, Nanavati summoned Harbhajan and Sreesanth to Ahmedabad this week- end.         
	I have summoned them. They have been told to come either on Friday or Saturday. Harbhajan will be coming on Friday. Sreesanth is yet to confirm a date, he said on Monday.         
	Nanavati was asked by the Board to probe the incident after Harbhajan was banned from playing the rest of the IPL by its disciplinary committee.         
	On whether Harbhajan should be punished twice for the same offence, Nanavati said, according to the BCCI contract, he gets a match fee for the whole year. He is also getting money separately for playing in IPL.         
	If he is getting paid by both the IPL and BCCI at the same time, he should be punished twice.                 (PTI)

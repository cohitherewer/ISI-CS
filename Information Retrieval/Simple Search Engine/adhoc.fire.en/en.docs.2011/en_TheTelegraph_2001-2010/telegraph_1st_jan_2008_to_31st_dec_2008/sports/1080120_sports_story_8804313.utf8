	Saturdays win at the Waca will go down as one of our most memorable Test victories, but I dont agree with those who feel its the greatest. Let me make it clear at the outset that Im in no way trying to undermine the effort of Anil Kumble and his men. They have done a wonderful job and achieved something that can change Indian cricket. 
    
	India had lost both their previous Tests in Perth. This was supposed to be the fastest wicket and the way our batsmen blunted the Aussie attack was a sight to behold. 
    
	The wins against the West Indies and England in 1971 under my captaincy remain Indias best. Simply because they were series-clinching efforts. The win in Perth will come next. It may not led to a series victory but will certainly restore confidence after losses in the first two Tests. 
    
	A lot has been said about the Perth wicket but I feel, like other pitches around the world, it has slowed down with time. Towards the end, some balls were keeping low and some turning. 
    
	Beating the No. 1 team in the world on a 16-match winning streak and in their stronghold speaks volumes of the teams versatility. Hats off to Anil Kumble! He led from the front, setting examples. The captain managed to pass on his positive approach among the others and it showed. 
    
	Kumble was aggressive, but it was all controlled. He managed to motivate the players brilliantly after what happened in Sydney. The events that followed the second Test brought the players together and enhanced team spirit. 
    
	The decision to bat first sent the right signal and left the Aussies dazed. The selection of Virender Sehwag proved to be a masterstroke. Besides his explosive batting, he took two important wickets in the second innings. 
    
	To get Dravid back to his favourite No. 3 spot also paid dividends. Special mention should be made of Laxman and Pathan. Laxman is the unsung hero of Indian cricket whose exploits have more often than not contributed to winning causes. The return of Pathan is a big advantage for the team. His all-round ability was being missed while he was out of form. 
    
	The one man impressed a great deal was Ishant Sharma. He was unfazed by the circumstances and the manner in which he tormented Ponting will remain etched in memory for long. He is the find of the series and has a bright future.

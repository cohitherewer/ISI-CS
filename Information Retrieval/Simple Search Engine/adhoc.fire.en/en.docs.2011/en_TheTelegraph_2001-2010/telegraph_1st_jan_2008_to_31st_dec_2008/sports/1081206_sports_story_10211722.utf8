The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting rues early return
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ponting rues early return
                      
	Melbourne: Conceding that the wrist injury might go on to plague the remainder of his career, Australia captain Ricky Ponting now regrets his premature comeback for the Test series in India.         
	Forced home early from the West Indies tour, Ponting put his wrist under the knife in July but returned to the Australian side which toured India for a four-match Test series which they lost 0-2.         
	Ponting, in fact, needed a cortisone injection in the Mohali Test and the 34-year-old Australian captain, who saw surgeon Greg Hoy on Thursday, said the decision to return ahead of the India tour was surely premature.         
	It would have been nice to have another couple of months off, but I wasnt afforded that luxury, the Australian captain was quoted as saying.         
	Though Ponting has been cleared to play in the home series against South Africa, the Australian said he was feeling the pain, while driving.         
	At the moment its an inflammatory injury. Hitting straight down the ground is probably where I have the most discomfort.         
	I will keep working on it, I will keep icing it, I will keep doing the treatment I need to do over the next little period and hopefully by the end of the summer its not around any more, he said.         
	After the defeat in India, Australia run the risk of losing the No. 1 status to South Africa in the upcoming series, an idea Ponting is not comfortable with.         
	We have never referred to ourselves as being the best team in the world, the champion team, that is just something that is said about us all the time. Its taken us a long time and a lot of great wins in different conditions around the world to give us that No. 1 spot.         
	So, if South Africa beat us 3-0, I dont know if that gives them enough points to get over us or whatever. But if they simply won the series 1-0 or 2-1, I dont think that would mean they deserve to take over that mantle, Ponting said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Max Mosley victory puts media in chains
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Max Mosley victory puts media in chains
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Max Mosley                           
	Max Mosley, president of the Federation Internationale de Automobile (FIA)  the governing body for Formula One and other international motor sports  won his breach of privacy case against the News of the World newspaper Thursday over its allegations that he engaged in a Nazi style orgy with five prostitutes.         
	In a powerful judgement, Mr Justice Eady, declared that however morally distasteful the public might find such activities, the press had no right to publish them as they did not constitute a significant crime. The judge acknowledged the growing influence in national life of the European Court of Human Rights, which gives peoples privacy precedence over the right of the media to investigate them.         
	Lawyers claimed that the judgement effectively introduced a privacy law into Britain, even though Parliament has never passed one. Mosley was secretly filmed conducting a five-hour sado-masochistic session at his Chelsea flat with the women, one of whom was the wife of an MI5 agent. Mosley won 60,000 damages - a record for a privacy case - with the judge ruling that the News of the World had produced no evidence of a Nazi link. The newspaper faces costs of 850,000.         
	Mosley decided not to sue for libel but to pursue a privacy action, which meant his case would not be heard by a jury. His case was bolstered by the Human Rights Act which came into force in 2000 and brought in a civil law known as misuse of private information. This judgement has nailed the Nazi lie on which the News of the World sought to justify their disgraceful intrusion into my private life, he said.         
	Colin Myler, the News of the World editor, said: Our press is less free today after another judgement based on privacy laws emanating from Europe.         
	Tory MPs accused the Government, which had opposed a privacy law, of allowing one in by the back door.         
	Last year James Purnell, as culture secretary, said: We agree there is no case for statutory regulation [of the press] and that a free press is a hallmark of our democracy.

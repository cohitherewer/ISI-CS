            OUR PRINCIPAL CORRESPONDENT            Houghton                           
	Mumbai: India coach Bob Houghton on Friday emphasised the importance of having a well co-ordinated national programme if India were to ever realise their dream of qualifying for the World Cup.         
	Pointing out the lack of exposure for talented young players coming through the age-group tournaments and academies, Houghton said that a domestic structure which gave enough competition for these players while protecting the top players from burnout was the need of the hour.         
	I see under-21 players who are part of the Olympic team sitting on the bench when they join the I-League. Thats unbelievable, Houghton, here to hold discussions with coaches, said.         
	If we are going to look at the 2018 World Cup, the qualifiers would be starting in seven years time from now. That means the current group of U-19, U-16 and U-14 players will be the nucleus. We need to focus on them, he said.         
	Houghton, who will be visiting Calcutta and Punjab to exchange his ideas with the coaches and officials there, said that by having the I-League spread over nine months and making tournaments like the Durand Cup and Santosh Trophy as pre-season buildup, the problem of giving enough rest to the senior players was solved. However, providing the under-19 players with competition was yet to be addressed.         
	We must get the state leagues to play the youngster more, he said. Of the players who left the Tata Academy, 14 joined the two teams of Calcutta. But they havent played a single match yet.         
	Regarding the India team itself, Houghton said he was looking at having international matches against Asian rivals more than European ones.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An intriguing test lies ahead for Fab Four
                                                                                                                                                                                                     An intriguing test lies ahead for Fab Four
    - Zaheer, Ishant combine to claim 9 wkts Ponting, Hussey guide visitors to 430           INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                            
	Bangalore: A determined opening partnership between Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir made Australias imposing first-innings score of 430 seem a little less daunting when rain forced a premature end to the second days play at the Chinnaswamy on Friday.         
	Ricky Pontings maiden hundred in India and Michael Husseys classy 146 had put the visitors firmly in control of the opening Test, but the Indian opening pair showed good application and temperament during their 91-minute stay at the wicket. The 68-run unbroken stand promises a solid riposte, but the third day will prove to be an intriguing test for the Fab Four on a dry and slow wicket with variable bounce.         
	Against a new-ball attack that was taking time to settle down, Sehwag scored freely, hitting seven boundaries. Gambhir was more circumspect, playing each ball on its merit.         
	If Ponting set the tone for the innings with outstanding resolve on the opening day, Hussey ensured the momentum was not lost. His ninth century in 26 Tests ended a record streak of low scores  five innings without a half-century  the longest in his remarkable career.         
	Positive in intent, Hussey never tried anything extravagant. Putting a heavy price on his wicket, he gathered runs with deft placement on both sides of the wicket. He batted for almost seven hours across two days, hitting 15 fours and a six off Harbhajan Singh.         
	The early departure of Shane Watson on Friday made no impact as Hussey continued with his prolific and consistent performance in the company of Brad Haddin.         
	Nicknamed Mr Cricket, Huss, as he is popularly called, made the most of sloppy Indian fielding, the worst being Sourav Gangulys failure to stop a regulation shot that made captain Anil Kumble turn his face away in disgust. The lefthanders calm outlook, mental strength and ability to perform outstandingly in any situation be it at the opening slot or at the middle-order has given him a new status in this Australian side. For the record, the Aussies have won all eight Tests where Hussey has scored a hundred.         
	Hussey knows the importance of chance in cricket. Left in the lurch for long by the Australian selectors, despite a Bradmanesque average in county and first-class cricket, he had to wait till the Langer-Hayden-Ponting triumvirate cracked.         
	Eleven years after making his debut for Western Australia, he sat in the dressing room at St Kilda, Melbourne, during a Pura Cup match in 2005 with Justin Langer and Adam Gilchrist going great guns. The Aussies had just lost the Ashes and most of the dressing room talk was about the changes that would be affected in the side for the series against The West Indies.         
	With over 15,000 first class runs, most were certain Husseys chance would come but not sure when. None of that was of any concern to fast bowler Gerard Denton as he ran in. The ball reared sharply and smacked Langer on the chest and he was forced to retire hurt. A scan revealed a fractured rib. Hussey had finally got his chance. He has never looked back since.         
	Perhaps, if Denton had attempted a yorker, Langer would have played that series. Hussey might have finished his career without a baggy green cap and Australia would have missed out on one of their finest batsmen.         
	Three years on, Hussey is the backbone of their middle-order, a vital cog in their effort to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The fastest man in history to reach 1,000 Test runs  he currently averages over 68.         
	Versatility, be it the opening slot or middle-order, is his asset as he has built on his patient game with a range of bottom-handed drives and deft glances.         
	The way he guided the inexperienced Haddin and tailender Brett Lee in building partnerships also highlighted his leadership qualities. Having added 91 for the sixth wicket with Haddin, he put on 59 for the eighth with Lee.         
	None of the bowlers troubled him except for Ishant Sharma (4/77), who moved the ball in both directions and extracted considerable bounce. No doubt the visitors managed to breathe a little easier when he was rested between long spells.         
	Kumble and Harbhajan, despite searching for footmarks on both sides of the wicket, lacked the killer instinct, and it was left to Zaheer Khan (5/91) and Ishant to pull the trigger. Despite a fiery spell on Thursday, Zaheer was unimpressive on the second morning. He returned with renewed zeal after tea to run through the Aussie innings and claim his sixth five-wicket haul in Tests.         
	Meanwhile, Ulrich Meggersee, a directed pressure point technique (DPPT) practitioner, has joined the Team India support staff at the request of the physical and mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Warne wish for Sachin on his 35th birthday
                  Sachin Tendulkar                     
	Jaipur: Legendary leg-spinner Shane Warne has wished Sachin Tendulkar as many playing years as he wants on his 35th birthday on Thursday.         
	Warne said cricket fans would have to wait for long to have another player of Tendulkars calibre, so he should be allowed to continue his career instead of critics suggesting him to retire in the wake of his injuries and occasional form-slumps.         
	He is a great player. We may have to wait for many-many years to have another player like him. He should be allowed to continue till he wants to, said Warne.         
	Warne, who is captaining and coaching the Rajasthan Royals team in the Indian Premier League, said Tendulkar was the best batsman in the recent times.         
	I feel West Indian Brian Lara and Sachin are the best batsmen of the recent times but I rate Sachin the best not only because of his amazing cricketing abilities but also because of the exemplary manner in which he conducts himself on and off the field.         
	He is a wonderful guy. Naturally and exceptionally talented, affectionate and always smiling. There may be other good batsmen in the world but I feel that the word great has been used most often for him. I feel Sachin is truly great because of the manner in which he conducts himself. He is disciplined, co-operative, naturally talented and dedicated player, he said.         
	Warne, who faced Tendulkar many a time on the field, said the Mumbai batsman was not only his cricketing rival when but also a family friend.         
	Warnesaid he had still not forgotten the smashing he had got at the hands of Tendulkar.         
	Perhaps there are only a few occasions when he had him read me wrongly. Once in Melbourne, I had him padding my flipper as he couldnt read me correctly. But I still remember another occasion when he smashed my first ball to the fence and on the next I had him caught in the slips with a big spinning ball. Such rare occasions gave me great satisfaction.         
	Tendulkar, who did not play for Mumbai Indians in Chennai on Wednesday, said he did not have anything planned. I have not decided anything yet. There is one programme tomorrow for sure and that is our travel programme. Celebration programme well I dont know any.         
	But the team has some surprise plan for me tomorrow but they have not told me much about it, he said.

                                                   Browns vote for Sir Sachin

           
	New Delhi: Cricketing greats from the Commonwealth nations such as Sachin Tendulkar should be considered for knighthood, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said. 
    
	It used to be the case that great cricketers from the Commonwealth countries would be recognised through our honoured system  we think of Sir Don Bradman or Sir Gary Sobers, Brown, who is on an official tour of India, said. 
    
	I believe it was a good tradition to celebrate the achievements of the great Commonwealth cricketers. It shows we are good sport and I would like to see some of the great players of the modern era  like Sachin Tendulkar  proposed for honorary awards so the British nation can salute them, Brown said.

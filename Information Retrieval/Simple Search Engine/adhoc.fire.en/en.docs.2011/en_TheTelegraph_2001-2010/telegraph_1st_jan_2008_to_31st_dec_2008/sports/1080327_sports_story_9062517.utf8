The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India hang in after flying start by South Africa 
                                                   India hang in after flying start by South Africa 
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Chennai: Anil Kumble loves to lead by example. Only on the match-eve, Ravi Shastri was all praise for his commitment and ruthlessness on the field.         
	The Indian captain showed quicksilver reflexes to pull off an acrobatic one-handed catch to his left in the last session of the opening day of the Future Cup series. That fine effort helped the hosts stay in the hunt even as South Africa threatened to run away with the honours.         
	Till Kumble dismissed Ashwell Prince in the 82nd over, the bowling looked innocuous and the fielding showed signs of crumbling. The dismissal provided the players with a spring in their steps as the visitors were made to toil for every run in the remaining 8.3 overs. The pressure suddenly seemed to tell on the batsmen.         
	South Africa, however, saw off that mini crisis without suffering any further damage to end the day on 304 for four, built largely by a 132-run opening partnership and an elegant unbeaten 85 from Hashim Amla. World record holders Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie made 73 and 94, respectively.         
	The Indians are hoping to restrict them to 375, and, as Harbhajan Singh said, then make things difficult for them in the second innings.         
	From the lively and bouncy tracks Down Under, it was back to the docile pitches in the subcontinent. India missed someone genuinely quick as both Rudra Pratap Singh and Sreesanth failed to make an impact with the new ball. The four-man attack was stretched to the hilt and it was ultimately left to Kumble and Harbhajan to work some magic in tandem.         
	The intense heat and humidity also played their part. It was decided to have a drinks break after every 40 minutes and two in every session. It did very little to improve the players zeal on the field as the sloppiness in the field often resulted in South Africa getting away with too many boundaries.         
	Smith and McKenzie made full use of winning the toss, piling on 109 runs in the opening session. The pair preyed on the bowlers profligacy as the wicket allowed very little room for the error.         
	Smith initially struggled against Sreesanth but grew in confidence as McKenzie pulled and drove with panache at the other end. It has been a dream comeback for the righthanded opener since returning to the side against the West Indies earlier this year after a three-and-half year exile.         
	He batted with the flourish and extravagance of a multimillionaire at a casino, dealing in boundaries and big shots. There were 18 fours in his innings that spanned 230 minutes.         
	Just when the Indians looked lost, Kumble provided the breakthrough, enticing Smith to drive a bit early for V.V.S. Laxman to take a smart catch at short mid wicket.         
	Amla was determined not to let go the opportunity. With an uncomplicated approach he delighted the sparse turnout with neat drives and flicks. It was against the run of play when Harbhajan finally managed to entice McKenzie to edge one to the lone slip, but not before he had tormented and frustrated the attack.         
	Jacques Kallis made just 13 when he decided to walk before Asad Rauf could raise his finger.

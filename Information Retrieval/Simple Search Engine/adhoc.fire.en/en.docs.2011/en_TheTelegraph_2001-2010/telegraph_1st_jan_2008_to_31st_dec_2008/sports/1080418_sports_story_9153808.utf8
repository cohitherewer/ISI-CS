                                                                                                                                                                                                       Younis Khan returns for final ODI 
            CRICKET BRIEFS    
	 Karachi: Younis Khan returned to the Pakistan squad for the final ODI against Bangladesh, denying reports that his pullout from the previous two matches was in protest of the questioning that he was subjected to by the ICC anti-corruption and security unit.         
	Younis also denied reports that his pullout was a result of differences in the team. Some things did happen that were not to my liking but they didnt force me to rest for the last two games. Neither do I have any differences with anyone in the team, Younis said.  
	Yousuf lookalike   
	 Karachi: Security officials posted at the Multan stadium for the fourth ODI evicted a man trying to enter the host teams dressing room posing as senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf. Mohammed Shafiq, who belongs to a local village near Multan, is a Yousuf lookalike and has also styled himself on the batsman with the same flowing beard and cap.         
	On Wednesday, when Yousuf was on the field, Shafiq managed to break through several security cordons posing as the batsman and was just about to enter the dressing room when a security official stopped him and the truth was revealed.   
	WICB turns down invite   
	 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Boards effort to hold a home series received another jolt with the West Indies refusing to accept an invitation to play a few one-dayers. After being snubbed by Australia, India and Sri Lanka for security and other reasons, the PCB has now been told by the West Indies Cricket Board that they cant undertake a tour in August due to prior engagements.   
	Kapil wish   
	 London: After having a team from Pakistan in the Indian Cricket League, the organisers are now keen to include an English side in their Twenty20 tournament.         
	Kapil Dev, chairman of ICL board of directors, said he wanted to add a London or Birmingham team to the league. If I get a chance, if I have the money, I will definitely make one team from London or Birmingham. Give me the money and sponsor and I will do it, Kapil said.   
	Fica warning   
	 London: The Federation of International Cricketers Association has warned that the ICC may be faced with the biggest players revolt in the history of the game if it continues to be paralysed by the BCCI and remains incompetent in its handling of issues facing the sport.

	Born into an agricultural family in a town between The Hague and Amsterdam, from an early age Francina Fanny Blankers-Koen began to show signs of her impending nickname the Flying Housewife. The youngster enjoyed sewing, gardening and cycling. That was, until she discovered sport.         
	At the age of 14 her potential became apparent. She joined the Hoofdorp swimming club and the gymnastic and fencing association. There, Franz De Haan, her gymnastics coach, introduced her to athletics. Subsequently, Fanny joined the Amsterdam Womens Athletics club where she met her future husband Jan Blankers. He would later play a pivotal role in her success.         
	So began Fannys Olympic trail, amassing regional and national titles and eventual selection for the 1936 Games. At only 18, her stay in Germany ended with 5th in the 4x100m and 6th in the high jump.         
	Returning to Holland, Fanny trained through often bitterly cold winters. Her determination soon paid off and, in 1938, she broke her first world record in the 100 yards (11 sec).         
	The breakout of the second World War put paid to her Olympic ambitions. However, following her marriage to Jan Blankers in 1940, she continued to impress Europe with her versatility. At 30 years of age, when the Games resumed in London in 1948, the flying housewife romped home to wins in the 100m, 80m hurdles, 200m and the 4x100m.

                                                    Poor umpiring takes sheen off 16th win 

         Michael Clarke after taking three wickets in five balls to set up the 122-run win 
          
	Sydney: Atrocious umpiring and inept batting led to Indias shocking 122-run defeat against Australia in the second Test marked by bitterness between the two sides. 
    
	India failed to survive the last seven balls of the match as Michael Clarke snapped up three wickets in a span of five balls to give the hosts a record-equalling 16th consecutive Test win. 
    
	On a controversial fifth days play, the Indians were left to chase a stiff target of 333 in 72 overs but they were bundled out for 210 in 70.5 overs as Australia took an invincible 2-0 lead in the four-match series. 
    
	The victory in this Test, marked by controversial umpiring decisions and a simmering race row, allows the hosts to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. 
    
	In the nerve wracking final moments, it seemed India would manage a draw at 210 for seven but Clarke dismissed Harbhajan Singh, RP Singh and Ishant Sharma in quick succession to hand a dramatic victory to the Aussies. 
    
	The fifth and final day was sullied by some horrendous umpiring decisions and as has been the case so far, Australia had no reason to complaint while India found themselves at the receiving end of the goof-ups by Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson. 
    
	Although the Indians had reasons to be aggrieved with umpiring, the batting collapse was quite inexplicable as the fifth day Sydney Cricket Ground track did have something for the bowlers but was not unplayable. 
    
	Chasing 333, India had just shown signs of recovering from a top-order collapse that left them reeling at 54 for three when they lost Sourav Ganguly (51) and Rahul Dravid (38) to two terrible decisions. 
    
	Down the order, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (35) and Anil Kumble (45 not out) tried their best but failed to avert the defeat. Despite the defeat, Kumble and his men can still be encouraged from the fact that they fought against more than just 11 adversaries. 
    
	Earlier on Sunday morning, Mike Hussey struck an unbeaten 145 and along with Andrew Symonds (61) guided Australia to 401 for seven when Ricky Ponting declared their second innings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev has potential to be Indias best 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Somdev has potential to be Indias best

	While Indian cricket soars to Olympian heights, tennis just about manages to keep its toe-hold in the Asian hierarchy. Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi battle on bravely with their fingers plugging the dyke of time.         
	For Paes, now 35 years of age, 2008 could have turned out to be his best year ever. A couple of points in the mens doubles semis at Wimbledon and in the finals of the US Open could well have given Paes a rich harvest of three Grand Slam titles in one year!         
	At the end of the year, Paes, partnering Cara Black, could garner only the mixed doubles title at the US Open, with a memorable display of teenage reflexes and unbridled enthusiasm.         
	In spite of a lower back surgery and other niggling injuries, Bhupathi who will be 35 in January, also had a great year with partner Mark Knowles.         
	Bhupathi is ranked No. 6 in the doubles, having made it to three finals in the ATP Masters series. He combines very well with Knowles and with luck could add to his impressive tally of 13 Grand Slams in 2009. Bhupathi and Paes, no longer together on a mono-rail but travelling on parallel lines, are still motoring along at full steam in the world of doubles.         
	They could well pick up a couple of Grand Slam titles in 2009. The defining moment will come when the inevitable loss of reflex and strength is more than what they can make up by way of their rich experience. Prakash Amritraj, now 25 years old and ranked 211 and Rohan Bopanna, 29 and ranked 310, have huffed and puffed for several years without even breaching the 200 barrier of the ATP rankings.         
	Bopanna has taken refuge in doubles play with good results and robust financial reward. He is talented, with a big serve and power game, which could have taken him to the top 100, but somehow he has not been able to get his act together.         
	Prakash had a very good run on grass in July at Newport to reach the finals where he succumbed to the the 57th ranked Fabrice Santoro of France. Prakashs victory over 99th ranked Frank Dancevic of Canada in the semi-finals was of significance. It was a dream run which underlined what could be a late blooming potential. Sadly, grasscourts are almost extinct and the pedigreed Prakash, with his net rushing tactics, is at his best on grass.                     Somdev		    
	He needs to perform on hardcourt and other surfaces to improve his rankings.         
	 The spotlight is now on Somdev Dev Varman. Trained in the US, Somdev has victories against high ranking players. There is plenty of scope for improvement in Somdevs game but he seems to be on track to become our No. 1 player and a future anchor of the Davis Cup team.         
	Some years ago I was told that there was only one graduate among the top 100 men. It is unlikely that there are many graduates or towering intellectuals amongst the top 100 women. Sania Mirzas doctorate from Madras University will certainly cause a stir in the world of tennis! A baffling gesture by the University to which Sanias response was I feel privileged. It is an honour before adding that she used to average 90 plus and got a first class in the 10th and 12th standards despite studying only a month before her exams.         
	A doctorate is the highest degree that a University can give and a statement of potential academic excellence by the recipient can hardly justify such an award. More than even Sanias tennis results  which at its best is mediocre  it seems her sparkling personality and glamour won the day. Also, many see her as a pioneer of liberating Indian womanhood.         
	It is a relief to see Sania back on the sports pages from the Bollywood film magazines. Her high profile comeback, showing her working out in the gym and throwing punches wearing boxing gloves and pronouncements by her physical trainer that she is absolutely fit and raring to go is very heartening indeed.         
	She must proceed with utmost caution. She cannot afford any more breakdowns. Patience and a conservative approach will keep her injury free as she climbs back to the top 30.

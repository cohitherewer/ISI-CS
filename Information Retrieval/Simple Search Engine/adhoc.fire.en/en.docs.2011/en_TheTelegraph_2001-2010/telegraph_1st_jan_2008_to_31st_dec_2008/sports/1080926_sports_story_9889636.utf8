The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India A hold the edge versus Australia A
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India A hold the edge versus Australia A
                      
	Chennai: After their morale-boosting 3-wicket win over Australia A, India A will have the edge when the two teams clash in the final of the triangular series at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday.         
	The win, third in a row, in Wednesdays inconsequential last league match helped Indians to settle scores for their 17-run loss against the Australians in the rain-marred first match in Hyderabad. India, who scored 277 for 7 to wrap up the league phase with 13 points, would also have the home advantage.         
	However, weather is likely to play spoilsport as pre-monsoon rains lashed the city since last evening, to be precise, minutes after the covers were put on after the stumps were drawn. Met officials have forecast cloudy skies with chances of showers till Friday morning. Following overnight rains, players did not have net practice.         
	Suresh Raina, leading the side in the absence of S. Badrinath, doing duty for the Rest of India as a last minute replacement for the injured Sachin Tendulkar, did a commendable job by not only notching up victory but also finding his touch with the bat at the right time.

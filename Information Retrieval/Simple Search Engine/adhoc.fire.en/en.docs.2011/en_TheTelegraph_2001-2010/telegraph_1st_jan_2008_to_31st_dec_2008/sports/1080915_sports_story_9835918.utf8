            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will send a letter to Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra on Monday in response to his controversial comments made during the title celebrations at the club premises on Saturday.         
	Mohammedan Sporting secretary SultanAhmed said that the strongly worded letter would demand an apology from Mitra.         
	We will congratulate Bagan for their league win, but we will also seek an explanation from Mitra for his comments. We would expect a letter of apology from Mitra and Mohun Bagan, Ahmed said.         
	Though Mohammedan Sporting officials are not mulling further actions at the moment, the word is that if an apology from Mitra doesnt come soon, the club might then move to the ethics division of the AIFF.

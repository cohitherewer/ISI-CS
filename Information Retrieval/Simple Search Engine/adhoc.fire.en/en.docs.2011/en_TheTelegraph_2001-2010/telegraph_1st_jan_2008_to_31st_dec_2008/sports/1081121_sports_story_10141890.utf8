The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gavaskar hits back at Ricky Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gavaskar hits back at Ricky Ponting
                      
	New Delhi: Sunil Gavaskar hit back at Ricky Ponting on Thursday for his uncalled for remarks that the former India captain was no angel in his hey-days, saying the Australian captains comments were an indication that his side was rattled to find a challenger in India.         
	I think it was totally uncalled for and it is showing the world that they are rattled, Gavaskar told a television channel.         
	The former Indian captain said Pontings comments also smelled of publicity gimmick.         
	I think they have been a champion side and suddenly they find that they have a challenger in India,         
	Ponting, in his just-published Captains Diary 2008, has lashed out at Gavaskar and other former players for often blaming the Australian team for on-field confrontations.         
	I still have a vivid image of Sunil Gavaskar angrily trying to take his opening partner off the MCG with him in 1981 when he was given out lbw in a Test match, but to hear him today youd think he was positively angelic when he was the best opening batsman in the world, he wrote.         
	Gavaskar pointed out that Ponting would not have a clear understanding of the incident as he was just a child then.         
	Ponting was just seven-year-old when MCG incident happened. He does not know the background, he said. (PTI)

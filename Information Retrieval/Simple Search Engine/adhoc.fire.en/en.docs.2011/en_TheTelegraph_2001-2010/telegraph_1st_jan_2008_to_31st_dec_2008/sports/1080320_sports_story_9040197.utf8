            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Wednesday was a day of long knives with six of the eight winners on the cards being outsiders. The afternoons feature event, the 1,200m Colonial Cup, was no exception with trainer Robin Corners less-fancied ward, Royal County Down having the measure of the favourite, Antonique. Corner also had another surprise in store  Namgay, who made every post of the Artwork Handicap a winning one. Namgay, however, presented apprentice jockey Pradeep Kumar his maiden victory.           
	Sportsman and Salazaar were the only fancied runners who scored. As a result of outsiders taking centre stage, the jackpot pool amounting to Rs 3,92,970 remained unsolved.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | US in semis
                                                                                                                                                                                                     US in semis
                      
	London: Andy Roddick took out his frustrations on Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu on Sunday to seal a place for the United States in the Davis Cup semi-finals.         
	The holders had been expected to wrap up their quarter final tie in Winston-Salem against France on Saturday but a rare defeat for top-ranked doubles pair Bob and Mike Bryan meant the Americans had to put their celebrations on hold for 24 hours.         
	But as soon as Roddick stepped out on court on Sunday, it was clear that he was in no mood to hang around and pulverised Mathieu in 97 minutes, clinching the match with two aces. A ruthless 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 exhibition handed the Americans an unbeatable 3-1 lead and a semi-final date with Spain.         
	The US ended 4-1 winners over France after James Blake beat Richard Gasquet in the dead rubber 6-7, 6-4, 6-4.         
	Spain, who were the only nation to reach the last four on Saturday, completed a 4-1 win against Germany in Bremen.         
	Russia and Argentina will contest the other semi-final in September. Russia benefited from the misfortune of one of their opponents to earn the winning point. Czech No. 1 Tomas Berdych injured his ankle and was forced to quit midway through the fifth set of his tussle against Nikolay Davydenko.

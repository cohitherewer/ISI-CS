                                                   We need Lee magic: Steve

      A STAFF REPORTER 
           
	Calcutta: The legendary Steve Waugh is all praise for Anil Kumble, saying the India captain may not be the headline-hunter like Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan but he is quite yet equally deadly. 
    
	Kumble has taken 600 wickets with a fraction of the publicity afforded to Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan but he has been a much admired performer among his rivals, Waugh wrote in his column in the Australian newspaper, The Daily Telegraph. 
    
	He is not the type of player who gives you a restless nights sleep as you ponder his threat, but he is a specialist at ploughing through your dropped guard if you relax for the briefest moment. 
    
	Indian players are generally not renowned for their fitness but he is. The Australian side greatly admire the way his last over of a marathon day is bowled with as much energy as his first, the former Australian captain said. 
    
	Waugh was also surprised by Indias show in the ongoing Test. In my last series four years ago we didnt play India in Perth and after the series was drawn there was a whisper on every street corner that next time the Indians would not be so lucky and a Waca Test would be non-negotiable.. 
    
	The Indians exceptional swing bowling will take a lot of fans back to the early-1980s when Kapil Dev proved a real handful for the Australians with his masterful late swing. You have to admire the high class work of the Indian bowlers, Waugh said. 
    
	When the Indian side batted on day one all of the talk was that it was a batsmans deck. Suddenly on day two it seemed to grow claws when the Indian pacemen were let loose. If this series has proved anything it was that the Indians are made of stern stuff. 
    
	According to Waugh, Australia need some special Brett Lee magic to harbour any chances of scripting their record 17th Test win in a row in Perth. 
    
	I am hoping for Australias sake Lee has one last big surge in him in this match. He deserves to be rated the No. 1 fast man in the world with South African Dale Steyn the only quick I can put close to him, given the reasonably shallow state of world pace stocks, Waugh maintained.

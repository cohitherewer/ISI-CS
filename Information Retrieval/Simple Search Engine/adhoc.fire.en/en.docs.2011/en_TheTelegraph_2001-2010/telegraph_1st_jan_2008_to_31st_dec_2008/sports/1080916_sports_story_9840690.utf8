	Dhaka: Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials will on Tuesday meet with six Bangladesh players, including former captain Habibul Bashar, who resigned from the national team in an apparent move to join the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	 Bashar, Shariar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, Mosharraf Hossain, Farhad Reza and Dhiman Ghosh cited personal reasons in their resignation letters on Sunday, Bangladesh Cricket Board member Ashraf Hossain said on Monday.         
	 Hossain said board officials will meet the players to try to persuade them to change their minds. The players only said they will not be available for the national team, he said. Local media reports said as many as 14 Bangladesh players could quit the national team to join the lucrative ICL.

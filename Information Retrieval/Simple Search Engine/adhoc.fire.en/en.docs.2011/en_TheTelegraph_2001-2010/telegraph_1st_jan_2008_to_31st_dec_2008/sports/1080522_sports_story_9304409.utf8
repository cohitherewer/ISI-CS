The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rain threat looms large
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rain threat looms large
  - Efforts on to get Shoaib fit for todays tie       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Only a miracle will now see Kolkata Knight Riders making it to the semi-finals. Mumbai Indians loss to Kings XI Punjab on Wednesday will make them breathe slightly easy.         
	Sourav Ganguly and his men need to win their remaining two matches to harbour any further hopes. Their match against Delhi DareDevils on Thursday is set to attract a full house at the Kotla provided the weather holds.         
	Overnight rain cast a spell of uncertainty even as the ground staff was working overtime to make it fit for play. A washout would mean disaster for both sides.         
	On Tuesday night, the capital experienced its heaviest rainfall in five years and weathermen have predicted more rain in the next 24 hours. None of the two teams could have their nets as there was pool of water around the practice ground.         
	The weather has assumed great significance in this match and the entire DareDevils management is now busy minutely examining the nitty gritties of the Duckworth Lewis system. An official has been given the responsibility to monitor the weather and the subsequent change in equation in case it rains during the match.         
	Knight Riders performance in the last few matches has been dismal and on Tuesday they recorded their third straight defeat. They will certainly look up to their captain to provide the right inspiration at the top of the order on Wednesday. So far, the former India captain has scored 263 runs in 12 matches with just two 50 plus knocks.         
	David Hussey has been the other consistent performer besides Salman Butt, who has been among runs in the last couple of matches. A score around 150 hasnt been sufficient in their previous encounters and they need to score beyond that to put their opponents under pressure.         
	Knight Riders started their campaign in the IPL as favourites but have paid dearly for their poor batting after a rousing start against Bangalore Royal Challengers.         
	Knight Riders would definitely make an all out effort to field their Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who couldnt play the last match because of a knee injury. According to a team official, physio Andrew Leipus is making all efforts to make the star bowler fit before the crucial tie on Thursday.         
	Our physio is working with Shoaib and we hope to get the best result before tomorrows match, said the official.         
	It may be recalled that in their previous encounter against Virender Sehwags men, Shoaib had run through their top order to facilitate the Knight Riders victory.

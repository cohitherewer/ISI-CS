The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer loses to Nadal again
                                                                                                                                                                                             Federer loses to Nadal again
                  Rafael Nadal with the trophy on Sunday                     
	Monte Carlo: Rafael Nadal became the first player in the Open era to win four consecutive Monte Carlo Masters titles when he beat world No. 1 Roger Federer in the final for the third year in a row on Sunday.         
	The second seeded Spaniard, who beat the Swiss 7-5, 7-5, has won his last 22 matches in the principality and has already shown he is the hot favourite to win next months French Open for the fourth year in succession.         
	Before him, only New Zealands Anthony Wilding had won four straight titles in Monte Carlo, back in 1914.         
	Nadal became the first player since American Jim Courier in 1991 in Indian Wells to win the singles and doubles titles at a Masters Series event when, with compatriot Tommy Robredo, he beat Mark Knowles and Mahesh Bhupathi 6-3, 6-3 in the doubles final.         
	The 21-year-old Nadal improved his personal record against Federer to 9-6 (7-1 on clay) and is undefeated on the Monte Carlo clay since a third-round loss to Argentine Guillermo Coria in 2003.         
	Its unthinkable, winning here for the fourth year in a row, Nadal said in a courtside interview.         
	Federer, who lost his Australian Open crown in January and had to wait until last Sunday to claim his first title of the year in Estoril, said: Hes a tough player on clay. Maybe my attacking game did not work so well. Im still close (to beating him). Its not getting much easier but I am right there and its a good thing.         
	Federer, who was on the brink of defeat against Spanish qualifier Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo in the first round, said he felt relieved to be back.         
	I am coming back strong and am happy the way things are now, said the Swiss, who had mononucleosis earlier this year. A few weeks ago I was still in a bit of doubt.         
	Following an early exchange of breaks, Federer stole Nadals serve in the seventh game, only for the Spaniard to break straight back with a crosscourt forehand winner.         
	The Majorcan put all his energy into the 12th game and claimed the set by retrieving a nonchalant volley from Federer.         
	The Swiss 12-time Grand Slam winner, who was inefficient on second serve, did not look strong enough to trouble Nadal. But he came into the second set all guns blazing, attacking the net and managing to hold serve after breaking in the first game.

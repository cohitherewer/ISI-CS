            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh and jockey C. Alford, who is serving suspension, are almost assured of championship honours as the season draws to closure. However, the competition continues to be tough as far as racing is concerned and the back to back last two race meetings, beginning Thursday, are not going to be any different.          
	Thursdays main event, the 1,200m Delhi Race Club Cup provides Diomedes the last chance to prove his mettle.

Appu.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

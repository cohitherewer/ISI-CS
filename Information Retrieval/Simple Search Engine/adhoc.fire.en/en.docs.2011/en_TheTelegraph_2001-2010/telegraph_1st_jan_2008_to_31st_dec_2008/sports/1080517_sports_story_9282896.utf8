            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Doping scandal continues to haunt Indian weightlifting with another lifter testing positive for using a banned substance, according to Sports Authority of India (SAI) sources.         
	A few days back, women lifter Kavita Devi, once considered a medal prospect at the international level, was banned by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) when she tested positive for banned steroid methadienone in an out of competition test conducted by the world anti-doping agency in March at NIS, Patiala.         
	Kavita, who was a member of the Indian team for the Asian championships in Japan last month, was sent back and was later banned for two years. She has also been fined Rs 25,000 by the Indian federation.         
	In the latest incident, a Karnataka lifter Paritosh Upadhyay (94 kg) has tested positive after his A sample, collected earlier this year. He has been found to contain traces of a banned substance in the tests conducted at the SAI laboratory.         
	Sources said that the sports minister M.S. Gill is extremely upset with the development and has asked the IWF president Harbhajan Singh to explain the situation.

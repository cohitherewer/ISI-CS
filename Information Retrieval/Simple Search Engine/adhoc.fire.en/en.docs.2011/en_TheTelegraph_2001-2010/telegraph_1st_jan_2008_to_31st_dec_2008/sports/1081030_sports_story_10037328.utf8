The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - A long wait begins
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A long wait begins 
            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: The inevitable has happened. The start of the Mumbai season has been put on hold until end-December, informed an RWITC heavyweight who did not want to be identified. Things do not seem to be going right. The start of the season is out of question before the New Year; said a source.           
	The season was to get a delayed start  end of November  but things seems to be going out of hand now. The mysterious equine fever that broke out in Pune appears to be taking the dreaded course of the Equine Flu. With nearly 500 horses already affected by the disease, the movement of horses, between Pune, Mumbai has been banned until further notice. Incidentally, a similar fever has also broken out in Delhi.          
	The city races are also going to suffer because of the new developments in the western India. In the month of September, RCTC had banned the city bound horses, from Pune and Mumbai, from where nearly 100 horses were expected to have arrived.           
	Two contingents comprising 33 horses have, however, already arrived in the city from the South. More horses from the southern centres may follow unless the government agencies get into action. A bigger ban on the all-India movement of horses may come into force any time, said an RCTC official.           
	Asked to comment on the matter, the RCTC chairman, Cyrus Madan said: The scene is bad in the RWITC and it does affect us directly. However, we are comfortably placed with our present horse-strength of 495 horses.

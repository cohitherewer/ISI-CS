The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians end tied 17th, Sweden champions
                                                                                                                                                                                           Indians end tied 17th, Sweden champions
                      
	Shenzhen (China): Jeev Milkha Singh could not really set alight the turf, while Jyoti Randhawa, too, was not in his elements and the Indian pair brought home a final round card of one-under 71 to finish tied 17th in the Omega Mission Hills World Cup golf tournament here on Sunday.         
	The duo needed something special in the foursome format to haul them up among the top-10 but all they could manage was a 71 and the aggregate of eight-under 280 was good enough only for a share of the 17th place and a $61,000.         
	They thus fell short of Indias best show in the tournament so far, which came in 2005 when Randhawa had teamed up with Arjun Atwal for a ninth-place finish. The Indian duos discomfiture in this format was all too evident as they dropped bogeys on the fourth and 14th holes. Birdies on the second, 10th and 11th holes did put them under-par but that was just not enough for a strong finish.         
	At the top, Robert Karlsson and Henrik Stenson produced a magnificent three-stroke victory for Sweden after shooting a nine-under 63 in the final round. Four shots off the lead at the start of the day, the Swedes charged up the leaderboard with a stunning front nine of 31 in the alternate shot format to tie Spains Miguel Angel Jimenez and Pablo Larrazabal, before racing home for Swedens second triumph with four more birdies.

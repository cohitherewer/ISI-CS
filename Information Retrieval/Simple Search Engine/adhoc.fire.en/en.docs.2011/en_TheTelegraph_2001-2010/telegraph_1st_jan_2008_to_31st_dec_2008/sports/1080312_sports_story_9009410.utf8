                                                     Butt, Hafeez snapped up by the Knight Riders   Aamir, Kareena for ICL
  - Sreevats Goswami signs for Bangalore Royal Challengers         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Salman Butt                                 
	Mumbai: Bengals emerging star Sreevats Goswami will bat for Bangalore, while bowlers Iqbal Abdullah (Mumbai) and Siddharth Kaul (Punjab) were sold to the Calcutta franchise through a draft procedure in the second IPL auction Tuesday.         
	The Under-19 World Cup winning captain, Virat Kohli (Delhi), too went to Bangalore Royal Challengers. All but two players from Indias U-19 World Cup winning squad found takers.         
	Following their success in Kuala Lumpur, Indias U-19 boys have emerged national heroes. But they still have a long way to go before they emerge as brands or stars in their own right, said an Fraser Castellino, CEO of Emerging Media which owns the Jaipur Team.         
	The Indian colts will be paid a fixed player fee of $30,000 for one year, with the franchises allowed to choose them on the NBA style draft system.         
	Of the 25 international players on the bidding block, the surprise package was Dimitri Mascarenhas, who became the first England player to join the IPL. The Hampshire player was bought by the Jaipur team for $100,000.         
	No England player was available at the first players auction held last month.         
	With a price tag of $300,000, Australia allrounder James Hopes led the list of 14 players who were bought by seven franchises.         
	Having spent their entire corpus of $5 million in the first auction, Hyderabad stayed away.         
	Following Hopes with the second highest bid of the day was South African batsman Ashwell Prince who went to the Mumbai team for $175,000.         
	Pakistans Misbah-ul Haq was bought for $125,000 by the Bangalore team who also picked up New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor ($100,000).         
	Salman Butt and Mohammed Hafeez were bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders for $100,000 each.         
	Australian Shane Watson, who has endured a stop-start career after struggling with injuries, was grabbed for $125,000 by the Jaipur team to be led by Aussie legend Shane Warne.         
	Fighting a legal battle with the breakaway ICL, Mohammed Yousuf did not find a bidder. The Pakistani middle-order batsman will however get the contracted amount by the IPL.         
	Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait was not considered because his offer came in too late, said an IPL spokesperson.               
	If SRK and Preity Zinta are adding that dash of glamour to IPL, the Indian Cricket League (ICL) is trying to rope in Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor to spice-up the rebel league, which has failed to generate good response. It is not clear how the ICL plans to rope in the Bollywood stars but sources say talks are at an advanced stage.

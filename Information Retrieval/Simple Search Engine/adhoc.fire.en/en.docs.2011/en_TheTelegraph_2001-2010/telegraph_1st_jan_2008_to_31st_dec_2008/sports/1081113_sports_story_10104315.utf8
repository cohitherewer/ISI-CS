The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hayden wants Symonds back
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hayden wants Symonds back
                      
	Sydney: The Australian cricket team is a stronger force with allrounder Andrew Symonds in the line-up, senior batsman Matthew Hayden said on Wednesday. Hayden said his close friend and fishing partner Symonds will be welcomed back with open arms by Australian teammates who are keen to forgive and forget.         
	Im going to be incredibly biased and say I want to have Symo back in the side as soon as possible, Hayden said. I think as weve said all along, an Australian side with Andrew Symonds in it is a better side.         
	Meanwhile, Symonds has disclosed in his book how he was unusually impressed by the rare sight of V.V.S. Laxman overshadowing an in-form Sachin Tendulkar during the Sydney Test in January.

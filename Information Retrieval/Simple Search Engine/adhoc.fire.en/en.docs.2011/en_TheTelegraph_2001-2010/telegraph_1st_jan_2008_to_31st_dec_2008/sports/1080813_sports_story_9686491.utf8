	Karachi: Strengthening their pace attack, the Pakistani selectors today included controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar and his fellow paceman Umar Gul in the final 15-man squad for next months Champions Trophy.         
	The selectors have also recalled Kamran Akmal, who was dropped for the Asia Cup tournament in June at home, while picking two young batsmen Bazid Khan and Khalid Latif.         
	Bazid and Latif have been picked as our most experienced batsman Mohammed Yousuf is unavailable for the tournament and we hope they will add depth to the batting, chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said at a news conference.         
	He said Shoaib, Gul and Shahid Afridi, who all had fitness problems ahead of the trial matches last week, were cleared by doctors.                     
	They have a lot of experience between them and will give depth to the bowling, he said.         
	PCB chief operating officer said that Shoaib was picked after the board decided to keep the issue of his paying the fine imposed on him separate from his selection.

	Ahmedabad: India proved why they are the Twenty20 champions! Playing shots in a fashion so common in the shortest format of the game and having been bowled out in exactly 20 overs. They created history for all the wrong reasons at the Motera in the second Test for the Future Cup on Thursday.         
	Seventy six in 109 minutes was all that the much vaunted batting line-up minus Sachin Tendulkar could manage on a pitch which wasnt comatose like the Chepauk, completing the process of getting out in the opening session of a Test match for the first time in the subcontinent and leaving one to wonder whether the multi-million dollar Indian Premier League has hit the country a fortnight earlier than its launch.         
	Making the entire episode appear more dramatic, South African openers Graeme Smith (34) and Neil McKenzie (42) found themselves in marking their guard for an over before the lunch break.         
	Dale Steyn was the wrecker-in-chief, claiming five for 23 in just eight overs, Makhaya Ntini and Morne Morkel hastening Indias collapse with three and two wickets, respectively.         
	South African batsmen then got a complete stranglehold over the match, finishing the day at 223 for four, already a lead of 147 and the unbeaten stand of 106 between Jacques Kallis (60) and AB de Villiers (59) promising to pile more misery on the hapless hosts.         
	On a lively pitch, the Indian batting was dead and buried in no time.         
	And the Indian think tank was left speechless. Its a bad day in office for us, coach Gary Kirsten later said. We were not simply worth our salt, he added.         
	Captain Kumble didnt wish to say anything. I dont want to comment, said Kumble before leaving the ground. His disappointment with the days proceedings writ large on his face.         
	It was in stark contrast to what had happened in Chennai just a few days ago, when the bowlers toiled for 25 wickets for 1498 runs over the five days.         
	Kumbles decision to bat first was a bold one and when Wasim Jaffer slashed Ntini over slip and Virender Sehwag sent a Steyn delivery towards the square-leg boundary, it seemed business as usual.         
	But the openers departed in back-to-back overs, setting the stage for a horror show. The following batsmen, instead of showing application on a track giving hint of some movement, chose the Twenty20 path of blasting their way out of the crisis and ended up scripting a dramatic collapse.         
	Sehwag was found wanting against Steyns chin music but it was Ntini who really rocked with a fine demonstration of pace and swing.         
	There is an interesting story about how Ntini was discovered as a raw talent. He was rearing cattle at his village of Mdingi when a Cricket South Africa development programme official spotted him. He was asked to hurl a ball fast and the result took the official by surprise.         
	Some 15 years since that day, Ntini found used his magic on a different livestock  Indias top order. And like an experienced shepherd, the 31-year-old showed Jaffer, V.V.S. Laxman and Sourav Ganguly the door in a superb spell of intent and character.         
	Jaffer (9) was caught on the crease, Laxman (3) shouldered arms to a delivery which zipped in to clip the top of his stumps and Sourav (0) was a man caught in two minds, before dragging one onto his stumps.         
	It was four for 53 when Ntini decided to take a break, his first spell reading 6-1-18-3. Steyn, changing ends, took over from where his partner had left and shook The Wall with the first ball of his second spell with a beauty.         
	It was undoubtedly the delivery of the day  one pitched on a good length and then seamed away, beating Rahul Dravid (3) all ends up despite the latters best possible effort to offer a straight bat against it.         
	Morkel joined the party soon, dismissing Dhoni and, so, a shade over an hour, Kumble returned to where he started it all, having correctly called the spin of the coin and boldly accepting the challenge of batting first.         
	It was a long and different walk, heavily burdened with responsibility and clearly aware of the horror going on in the middle.         
	The gangly Morkel took only a couple of balls to end the home captains participation and suddenly India were staring at their lowest total against the visitors  66 at the Kingsmead in 1996-97.Top scorer Irfan Pathans gutsy unbeaten 21 (19 extras being the second highest score on the board) saved India from that ignominy.

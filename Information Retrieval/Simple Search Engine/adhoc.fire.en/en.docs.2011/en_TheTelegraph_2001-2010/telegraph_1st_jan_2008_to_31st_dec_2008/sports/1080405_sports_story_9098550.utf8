                                                     Wenger: Race is still open
                  Arsene Wenger                     
	London: Arsenal can give up hope of securing the Premier League title if they lose Saturdays clash with Liverpool at the Emirates, manager Arsene Wenger said on Friday.         
	We have to win all our games to win the title. Five wins is a minimum and a draw but that means we would have to win at Old Trafford. Six wins would be better, he said.         
	Third-placed Arsenal trail Manchester United by six points and Chelsea by one. I believe United will drop points. They play four times away from home, Wenger said. It depends on how the games go and how much effort the teams put in but no win is guaranteed in the Premier League.         
	Manchester United are an excellent team but they can still lose points and they have hard games against us and Chelsea. Everything is still possible, of course. But the main thing for us is to win our games.         
	Arsenal have been overtaken in the last fortnight after leading the Premier League for most of the season.         
	They face United at Old Trafford on April 13. United visit Chelsea on April 26.         
	We have scored less goals and been slightly more unlucky recently. The coincidence has been against us and the form has dropped a bit, Wenger said.         
	But since the beginning of the season, we have lost two games and nobody can deny we have been consistent. We are now in the final sprint which will define and decide our season.         
	I would love to put some more pressure on Manchester United. I feel its very important to win our game first and therefore we need to be at our best.         
	Saturdays home game is the middle of three against Liverpool who held them to a 1-1 draw in the first leg of their Champions League quarter final last Wednesday. They go to Anfield for the second leg on Tuesday.         
	Wenger said all his players except Robin van Persie were available and he would choose his team on the basis of fitness, freshness and tactics.         
	Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez, whose side is unlikely to finish better than fourth, would make changes with the Champions League in mind, however, Wenger said.         
	My calculation is that they had eight players with big Premier League experience who didnt play. But I am not sure how many they will use. I am not sure whether Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres will play.

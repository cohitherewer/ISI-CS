                                                PCBs no to Shoaib
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has made it clear that fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar would not be able to play in the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) unless he signed a contract with them.         
	Although the board has not given a central contract to Shoaib, it has offered him a special retainer, which he has refused to sign saying he did not need any contracts to play for his country.         
	But Shafqat Naghmi, the chief operating officer of the board, said that unless Shoaib had a written contract with them he could not play in the IPL, which is backed by the member boards of the ICC.

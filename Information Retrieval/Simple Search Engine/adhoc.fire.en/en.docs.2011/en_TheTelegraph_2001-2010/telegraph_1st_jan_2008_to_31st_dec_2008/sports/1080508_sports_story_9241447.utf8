	Madrid: Rafael Nadal and the rest of the Spanish Davis Cup team accused their federation president on Wednesday of deceiving them in the process for selecting the venue for the semi-final against the United States.         
	Nadal, the three-time French Open champion, was among eight Spanish players and captain Emilio Sanchez-Vicario who signed an open letter denouncing Pedro Munozs dealings in choosing the host city for the September 19-21 match-up.         
	The players are upset that the Spanish federation appears to favour Madrid because of sponsorship money, despite concerns that the capital citys high altitude could take away the teams home-court advantage.         
	We feel it is our obligation to make public our uneasiness and disagreement with the president of the RFET, Pedro Munoz, and his management in which he has continued to deceive us in the decisions taken since the beginning of his mandate, the letter said, adding that Munoz has deceived some, if not all, of the candidate cities into believing that they had a chance of holding the tie when, in all moments, they never really had a chance.         
	Sanchez-Vicario and the eight players, who include fifth-ranked David Ferrer, former French Open champion Carlos Moya and former top-ranked player Juan Carlos Ferrero, stopped short of asking Munoz to resign.         
	However, they said they will boycott all promotional events for the Spanish federation and its sponsors as long as Munoz remains president.         
	Munoz said he had no plans to step down, and that he had done nothing wrong.

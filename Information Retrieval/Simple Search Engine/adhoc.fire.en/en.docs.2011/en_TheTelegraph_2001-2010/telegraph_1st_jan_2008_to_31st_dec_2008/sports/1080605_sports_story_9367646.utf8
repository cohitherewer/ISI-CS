The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif fate hangs in the balance
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Asif fate hangs in the balance
    - Dubai authorities await result of laboratory tests                 Mohammed Asif                           
	Dubai: The fate of Pakistani pacer Mohammed Asif, detained here four days ago for allegedly carrying contraband drugs, remained uncertain on Wednesday with authorities awaiting the result of his urine sample.         
	Pakistans ambassador to the UAE Ahsan Ullah Khan said that the beleaguered pacer continues to remain in the Dubai airport detention centre and his chances of returning home hinges on the outcome of the urine test he had undergone after being detained.         
	I am an optimist and always hopeful, the diplomat said, when asked about the chances of an early release of the Pakistani pacer.         
	Pakistan Cricket Board had subsequently rushed senior official Nadeem Akram to Dubai and hired a leading legal firm, Afridi and Angel, to bail out the beleaguered pacer.         
	The PCB said that a decision on the return of Asif to Pakistan would be taken in Dubai on Thursday.         
	It is all rubbish that any charges have been dropped against him or he is being released tonight. The public prosecutor will decide tomorrow what to do, Nadeem Akram, PCB director administration, said.         
	Akram said the Dubai authorities had sent the substance recovered from Asifs wallet for laboratory tests and also his blood and urine samples.         
	Two reports have been received today while one will be available Thursday. The reports would be studied by the public prosecutor who will also have a word with police officials and Asif, after which he will decide whether there is sufficient ground to press any charges against Asif or to release him and allow him to return home, Akram said.         
	We are expecting a decision from the prosecutors office by noon and the law firm we have hired in Dubai are constantly in touch with the authorities, he stated.         
	With Dubai going through a period of mourning following a death in the royal family, the Pakistan Cricket Board is afraid that the detained pacers release might get further delayed.         
	As far as we know there has been no fresh development in this case. And because there is a period of mourning in Dubai because of the death of a royal family member, his possible release could be delayed, PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi said.         
	Until the reports come, nothing is moving forward. The situation at the moment remains he is not charged but is under investigation by the Dubai authorities, Naghmi said.         
	It might take some more time for this matter to be fully resolved, he added.         
	Asif has been in the Dubai airport detention centre since Sunday morning when he reached there for a 15-hour transit stay while returning from Mumbai on his way home.         
	Authorities at the Dubai airport detained him after finding the pacer in a drunken state and also found some recreational drugs in his possession.         
	Immediate blood tests confirmed Asif was intoxicated and the pacer was detained.         
	A journalist who visited the detention centre said Asif was now starting to feel the strain of the detention and also the ramifications of his actions.         
	Meanwhile, another senior board official rubbished media reports claiming PCB had sought the help of the government and political figures to seek assistance from the royal family in Dubai.           (PTI)

                                                   East Bengal caught in age scandal

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	New Delhi: East Bengal were on Sunday found guilty of fielding over-aged players in the Manchester United Premier Cup (MUPC), a day after losing in the semi-finals of the prestigious under-15 tournament being played in Goa. 
    
	Three East Bengal players, made to undergo an MRI scan by the organisers, were found to be above the stipulated age by the medical team that conducted the tests. 
    
	They are Bikash Hari, Amit Shee and Subhas Sarkar. According to tournament rules the Calcutta team, which qualified for MUPC World Finals last year, could be banned for one year. 
    
	East Bengal were not the only team in trouble at the eight-team India Finals that concluded at Mapusas Duler Ground in Goa on Sunday: three other teams including both finalists  Sant Bawa Academy (Gurdaspur) and Sarbasikshya Abhiyan Academy (Mizoram)  were also scratched for the same offence. 
    
	The results of the MRI tests were only released on Sunday morning, putting the organisers in a spot of bother. They had to hastily change the teams for the final that was played in the evening. 
    
	Four teams  East Bengal, Gurdaspur, Mizoram and Cosmos Club, Chennai  had to be scratched, said a member of the organising committee. We had no option but to elevate the next two best teams  St Stephens Academy, Chandigarh, and Mahindra United to the final. 
    
	In the final, the Chandigarh side won 1-0, earning the right to represent India in the South Asia final in Kuala Lumpur. 
    
	The All India Football Federation also has to partially take the blame for this mess as it did little to check age-cheating during the preliminaries in Chandigarh and Chennai.

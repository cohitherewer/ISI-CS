The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Negative strategy under fire
                                                                                                                                                                                           CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Negative strategy under fire   
	Melbourne: Considered one of the main reasons behind low turnout in the five-day version of the game, defensive tactics are likely to invite negative points in the proposed ICC Test Championship. According to a report in a local daily, the idea of a Test championship, mooted by Cricket Australia (CA), has been discussed at length in the past six months by the ICC and has found support from all the member boards. The championship would be played four-yearly on a home-and-away basis with a quadrennial trophy and points deduction for negative strategy, the report said. However, nothing is cast in iron yet with I.S. Bindra, who will take over as the principal adviser to ICC next month, saying a lot of spadework needed to be done. The form, the format and the frequency are all part of the discussion at the moment, Bindra said.  
	Workhorse Lee         
	 Melbourne: Overburdened he may be, but Australian pace spearhead Brett Lee says he does not want to sit out of even one international match for his country as he continues to be haunted by the memories of being reduced to a 12th man before the 2005 Ashes series. Even as skipper Ricky Ponting expressed concerns about the increasing workload on Lee after the retirement of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, Lee said he was more than willing to take the extra burden as it was better than sitting out. Ive always said I would love to play every game for Australia. I hate being away. I had 18 months where I carried the drinks and I got so fed up with being 12th man, Lee said. Lee said it was during that frustrating period that he pushed his body hard and made himself fit enough to bowl long spells.         
	Tait ready         
	 Melbourne: Having recovered from mental and physical exhaustion that forced him to quit cricket earlier this year, Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait says he is ready to make a sooner than expected comeback to ease the growing burden on fellow pacer Brett Lee. Tait, who was targeting a return to cricket next season, says he is ready to make himself available this year if the selectors called him urgently for Lees sake. If they called me tomorrow and said, be ready in three weeks, Id do it, Tait was quoted as saying by a local newspaper. I dont know what frame of mind the selectors are in. I know I cant waltz back into an Australian cap but I am keen to get back. I am definitely coming back to play. It is a matter of when, he added.         
	PCB plan         
	 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) met the countrys top police officers to take stock of the security arrangements for the tournament to be staged here and in Lahore from June 24. Rehman Malik, the interior ministry adviser to the Prime Minister, said PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf had requested for the meeting three days back. He had some security fears on the ongoing situation of the country. We discussed their concerns ahead of the Asia Cup and the Champions Trophy and their concerns have been duly addressed, Malik said. Meanwhile, the ICC is all set to officially launch the logo and announce the sponsors of the Champions Trophy on June 18 in Lahore.

                                                   Aussies lack depth: Bond
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Shane Edward Bond, the man who plotted a dramatic Australian downfall in the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy last year, is happy that India could win the one-day tri-series Down Under.         
	The former New Zealand fast bowler, who had never gone wicketless in an innings in Test cricket, is currently in the capital to play in the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). Despite his busy schedule, Bond managed to watch the final in Brisbane.         
	Australians losing the match is good for the game, felt the one-time fiery fast bowler. It will generate interest, more so in Australia, because people will now come to the ground not just thinking about a home victory.         
	Bond said that the Indian triumph was not a fluke. Australia are no more a dominant force. They lack depth. I am sure they will struggle next time they come to the subcontinent. The New Zealand star is the second fastest man in history to take 100 ODI wickets behind Pakistans Saqlain Mushtaq. The performance of young Indian cricketers, especially Ishant Sharma, has impressed Bond a lot.         
	I am particularly impressed by Ishant Sharma, Bond said. He is a goodprospect. To bowl at 150kmph in the first series is a big achievement. He has forced people to sit up and take notice of him.         
	On the contrary, Bond felt the Australians are no more an invincible lot. They are losing players. Players like (Glenn) McGrath, (Shane) Warne, (Steve) Waugh have left the game. (Adam) Gilchrist has retired. (Mathew) Hayden may retire in the next couple of years. They were the best in the world. The other names dont scare, Bond said.         
	The New Zealand bowler said he was least surprised by Sachin Tendulkars performance in the tri-series final.

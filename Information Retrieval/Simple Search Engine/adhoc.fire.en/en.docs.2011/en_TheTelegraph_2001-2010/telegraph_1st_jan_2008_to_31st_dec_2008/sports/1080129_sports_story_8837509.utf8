                                                  Re-hearing not under oath
  - Appeals commissioner John Hansen lays down the procedure       A STAFF REPORTER             Appeals commissioner Justice John Hansen of New Zealand during a news conference in Adelaide on Monday                                 
	Calcutta: Justice John Hansen of New Zealand, the ICC Appeals Commissioner in the Harbhajan Singh case and a member of the Code of Conduct Commission, has a cricket background having been involved with the game both as a player and an administrator.         
	The following are excerpts from his briefing to the media in Adelaide on Monday morning on the procedure to be adopted at the appeal hearing:         
	Following a complaint by the Australian cricket captain, Mr Ricky Ponting, the umpires brought a charge pursuant to 3.3 of the Code of Conduct for Players and Team Officials against Mr Harbhajan Singh.         
	This prohibits using language or gesture that offends, insults, humiliates, intimidates, threatens, disparages or vilifies another person on the basis of that persons race, religion, gender, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.         
	The matter was heard by the ICC referee, Mr Mike Procter, on 6 January 2008. Mr Singh was found guilty of the charge as laid, and was banned for three Test matches.         
	Mr Singh has exercised his rights pursuant to Clause 11 of the Code of Conduct and has appealed against the referees decision.         
	In accordance with Section H, Clause 11(c) of the Code of Conduct, the ICC legal counsel, Ms Urvasi Naidoo, appointed me to hear Mr Singhs appeal.         
	The appeals process contained in Clause 11 of the Code of Conduct puts in place a robust procedure to ensure for a fair hearing, in this case for Mr Singh.         
	It was felt proper that Mr Singh should have the benefit of a personal hearing in this case. The process of that hearing is left to the discretion of the Appeals Commissioner, in this case myself.         
	However, in this case I have consulted counsel for Mr Singh and the Board of Control for Cricket in India, counsel for Cricket Australia and counsel assisting me, Mr John Jordan SC.         
	Following that consultation I have directed that the procedure to be adopted at the hearing will be as follows:         
	1. In accordance with normal sporting disciplinary hearings, and previous appeals, the hearing will be in private.         
	2. This will be a re-hearing, with evidence being given by all of the witnesses who gave evidence to the adjudicator, Mr Procter. There may also be some additional evidence, such as the transcript available from the stump microphone, which was not available to Mr Procter.         
	3. The witnesses will give viva-voce evidence that will be led by counsel assisting me, Mr Jordan. Opportunity will then be afforded to both the counsels to cross-examine the witnesses.         
	4. Again, in accordance with the practice adopted for sporting disciplinary hearings, the evidence will not be on oath.         
	The hearing will commence tomorrow (Tuesday, 29 January) at the Federal Court in Adelaide and will follow the procedure I have just outlined.         
	I should add that Section H, Clause 11 (e) of the Code of Conduct requires the Appeals Commissioner to hear and determine the appeal within seven days of appointment.         
	In this case, at the request of both the BCCI and Cricket Australia, I agreed to the adjournment of the hearing until tomorrow to enable all parties to be in a position to be prepared properly for this serious matter.         
	Given the time between Tests, the simple logistics of the matter did not allow a hearing to be convened within seven days in any event. A venue for the hearing had to be found. The necessary secretarial and transcription assistance needed to be put in place. Video links had to be arranged for witnesses and counsel who are overseas. Counsel had to be instructed. Obviously all these matters take some time.         
	At the end of the hearing I will consider my decision and reduce it to writing.         
	In accordance with Section H, Clause 11(g) of the Code of Conduct it will be forwarded to Mr Singh, Mr Procter, and the Chief Executive of the ICC. Following that required process I will deliver my decision publicly.         
	Harbhajan was found guilty of breaching the Level 3.3 which refers to players or team officials using language or gestures that offends, insults, humiliates, intimidates, threatens, disparages or vilifies another person on the basis of that persons race, religion, gender, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin during the third days play in the second Test between India and Australia at Sydney.         
	The charge against Harbhajan was laid by the on-field umpires Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires after the close of play on day three of the second Test between Australia and India at the Sydney Cricket Ground following a complaint they received from the Australia captain, Ponting.         
	The complaint was made by Ponting after the 116 th over of Indias first innings, prior to which Harbhajan is accused of making a racist comment directed at Australias Andrew Symonds.         
	The Code of Conduct hearing was conducted by Mike Procter of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees after the Test concluded on Sunday 6 January.

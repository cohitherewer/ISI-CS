	Calcutta: East Bengal, currently at fifth spot in I-League standings, will take on leaders Sporting Clube de Goa at the Salt Lake stadium here on Saturday.         
	 The coach and the players realise that there is still time to make amends.We have lost 12 points in seven matches so far. We know if were to get close to the title, we need to win tomorrows match. With the kind of form were in, I hope well win this, Rozario said after practice on Friday.         
	East Bengal will be happy to welcome Alvito DCunha to the playing XI for the first time in this I-League. But Rozario has decided to use this tried and tested soldier sparingly as he is coming back from an injury layoff.         
	Id like to blood him in the second half, not before that, Rozario said.

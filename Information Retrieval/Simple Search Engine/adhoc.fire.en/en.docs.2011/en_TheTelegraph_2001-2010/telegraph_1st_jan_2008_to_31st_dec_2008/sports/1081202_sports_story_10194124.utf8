  - RANJI TROPHY 
  -   Innings win over Tripura fetches hosts six points         A STAFF REPORTER            Bengal players return to the pavilion after their win over Tripura at the Eden on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Bengal recorded their second consecutive victory beating minnows Tripura by an innings and 11 runs to bag six points, including a bonus, in their Ranji Trophy Plate B match at the Eden on Monday.         
	The visitors were bowled out for 208, with Avik Chowdhury bagging three wickets. Ashok Dinda and Ritam Kundu took one wicket apiece.         
	Avik was the man who got the breakthrough on a morning when Bengal pacers, especially Ashok Dinda, looked mediocre. While Dinda gave away 38 runs in his nine overs on the day, Ranadeb Bose lacked direction. Dinda, however, started the slide on the third morning sending back overnight batsman Tushar Saha.         
	There was a brief resistance from the Tripura seventh wicket pair of Nishit Shetty and Rajib Dutta. In between, captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla dropped a Dutta catch at mid-on.         
	Left-handed batsman Shetty (73) and wicketkeeper Dutta (58) put up a brave display, showing good application and determination against the hosts.         
	The pair added 78 runs for the seventh wicket to give some respectability to the Tripura total, but that was not enough to avoid an innings defeat. Both batsmen batted with caution after Bengal had threatened to finish off the Tripura innings within the first hour on the third morning.         
	Dutta was the more aggressive of the two as Shetty anchored the innings. The left-hander was compact during his 227 minutes stay in the middle. He took 127 balls to score a respectable 73, before Avik (who replaced Dinda) uprooted his stumps in the 58th over.         
	Dutta stepped on the gas once Shetty left. But his ambition was cut short as Avik Chowdhury held on to a brilliant catch by in the deed off Ritam Kundu.         
	The next two batsmen  Vineet Jain and Jayanta Debnath  offered very little resistance. Both were sent back by Avik before they could open their account.         
	Bengal have 13 points from three outings. Bengal have named an unchanged squad for their next match against Assam in Guwahati from Friday.

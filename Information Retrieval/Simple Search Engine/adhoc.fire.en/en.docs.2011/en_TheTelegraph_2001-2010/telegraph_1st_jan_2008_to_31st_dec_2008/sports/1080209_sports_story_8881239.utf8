The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Grain on greens worries Atwal
                                                Grain on greens worries Atwal
                      
	New Delhi: Arjun Atwal regrets his putting has not blossomed on the greens of the Delhi Golf Club and the Orlando-based Indian, at tied sixth after Day II, reckons he will have to sort it out as he goes into the final two rounds of the Indian Masters.         
	With overnight leader Jyoti Randhawa tumbling down the leaderboard, Atwal, along with Digvijay Singh, is the highest placed Indian in the $2.5 million European Tour event. Atwal, however, admitted the grainy Bermuda grass leaves him on tenterhooks.         
	I never putted well here, Atwal said as he pointed towards the birdies that slipped through his fingers. At the ninth hole, I missed a two-foot birdie putt. Then at the 13th, I missed it by three feet and again at the 18th hole.         
	I have got to iron it out as I head for the weekend rounds, Atwal said.         
	Asked to compare the greens here with those in the US, Atwal, the first Indian to make it to the PGA Tour, said: In the US, only when you are playing in Florida, it gets grainy like this.         
	Atwals views were echoed by Ryder Cup star Darren Clarke, who carded a 69 on Friday. I struggled on the greens. They are so grainy that Im struggling to pick my lines. I just hung in there and chipped in at last which was a nice way to finish, said the golfer from Northern Ireland.         
	World No. 4 Ernie Els, who carded a 70 to make the cut, said Thursdays quadruple bogey nine on the par-five 18th still rankled him.         
	Just that one hole yesterday and it could have been a little bit different, he rued.           (PTI)

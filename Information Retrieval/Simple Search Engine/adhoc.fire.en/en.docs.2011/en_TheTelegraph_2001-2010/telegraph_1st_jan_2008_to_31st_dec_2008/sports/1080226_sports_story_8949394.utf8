The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant fined 15 per cent of match fee 
                                                   Ishant fined 15 per cent of match fee 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Strange are the ways of the Match Referees and International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	In the latest instance, Match Referee Jeff Crowe has admitted that Ishant Sharma may have been provoked by Andrew Symonds during the one-dayer at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday, but its only Ishant who has been booked.         
	The lanky Indian pacer has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee but no action has been taken against Symonds as umpires Daryl Harper, Tony Hill and Bruce Oxenford did not report him to the Match Referee.         
	Ishant was found guilty of breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct following an incident during the match against Australia in Sydney on Sunday.         
	Ishant was reported by the umpires and charged under section 1.6 of the Code of Conduct which deals with pointing or gesturing towards the pavilion in an aggressive manner by a bowler or other member of the fielding side upon the dismissal of a batsman.         
	The charge related to an incident during the Australia innings when Ishant pointed Symonds towards the pavilion after dismissing him in the 47th over with the home teams score being 296 for four.         
	Ishant pleaded guilty to the charge.         
	Explaining his decision, Crowe said: The gesture was a direct breach of the ICC Code of Conduct. I took into account the fact that Sharma may have been provoked and that this was his first offence and hence the penalty was at the lower end of the scale.         
	Clearly both teams are still sensitive to each others actions in the middle. ICC has recently reiterated that a zero tolerance attitude will be shown to abusive or insulting language and actions.         
	So hopefully the teams in these remaining matches in the tri-series will focus on the business of playing and entertaining.         
	The penalty range for a Level 1 offence is between an official reprimand and a fine of up to 50 per cent of the players match fee.         
	For Level 1 offences, there is no right of appeal and the Match Referees decision is final.         
	ICC CODE OF CONDUCT                 
	1.6: Pointing or gesturing towards the pavilion in an aggressive manner by a bowler or other member of the fielding side upon the dismissal of a batsman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes, Dlouhy out
                                                                                                                                                                                           Paes, Dlouhy out
                      
	London: Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy crashed out of Wimbledon with a five-set defeat at the hands of second seeds Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic in an epic semi-final clash spanning two days here on Friday.         
	The ninth-seeded Indo-Czech pair lost 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, 6-8 to the second seeded Canadian-Serb duo, who take on No. 1 Americans Mike and Bob Bryan in the summit clash.         
	With this loss, the Indian challenge in the Wimbledon came to an end.         
	In a battle that lasted more than three hours on Court No. 1, but took two days to complete, Paes and Dlouhy were done in by unforced errors  26 in all against 18 of their opponents  and their failure to convert 10 of the 12 break points that came their way in the match.         
	The two teams were tied 3-3 in the fourth set when play was suspended Thursday due to inclement weather and fading light.         
	And it was a pitched battle from the time play resumed with the fourth set taking as long as 47 minutes to finish and the Indo-Czech duo managed to survive the grind and delay the inevitable by clinching it.         
	Paes and Dlouhy failed to convert the only break point that came their way in the decider and lost their serve once, an opportunity that was enough for Nestor and Zimonjic to seal the match in their favour.

	Chennai: Gary Kirstens elder half-brother, Peter, will be among those sitting in judgement when he makes his debut as the Team India coach against the country he once played for  South Africa.         
	The three-Test series begins here on Wednesday.         
	Specifically, Peter (who played 12 Tests and 40 ODIs between 1991 and 1994) will be doing studio work for one of the TV channels.         
	From what I know, Peter will be based in Mumbai and be busy with studio work there, Gary told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	Peter, who has been off cricket entirely for a while, runs a guest house back in South Africa.

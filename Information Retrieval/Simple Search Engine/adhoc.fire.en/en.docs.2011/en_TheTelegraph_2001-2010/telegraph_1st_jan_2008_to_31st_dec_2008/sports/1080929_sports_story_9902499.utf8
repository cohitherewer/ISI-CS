The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AITA should help Somdev 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     AITA should help Somdev 
    - Slow clay is not the best surface for Prakashs attacking game                                     Serve Volley

	Victory against Romania in Bucharest in the recent Davis Cup tie would have taken India to the dizzy heights of the elite World Group of 16. The 1-4 loss pushed us back to the Asia Oceania Group I.         
	Paes and Bhupathi continued their winning spree, and notched up the lone face-saving match. While knocking out the opposition, their sparring with each other continues unabated. In fact, very sadly, with the infighting thats going on in the Davis Cup team, it should not be called a team at all.         
	The magic carpet of grasscourts has transported India to unrealistic levels in the Davis Cup. Grass, with low uneven bounce, the heat and vociferous drum-beating supporters with Delhi belly lurking in the background, is a lethal cocktail dreaded by foreign teams.         
	Two close hard-fought victories on grasscourts at home against Uzbekistan and Japan were the stepping-stones to our challenge for a place in the World Group. We were unlucky to play Romania in Bucharest.                     Somdev Dev Varman      
	In India on grasscourts, considering the standard of Romanias No. 2 player, we could have pulled off a 3-2 win with Paes and Bhupathi winning the doubles and Prakash Amritraj and Somdev Dev Varman beating their No. 2 player.         
	In Bucharest, their matches were close and the whole tie could have taken a different turn had Prakash won the first set of his opening match. Both our boys played well.         
	Prakash has shown improvement since the last tie against Japan, but slow clay is not the best surface for his hustling net attacking game. His game would be perfect if he could incorporate Somdevs consistency, patience and tenacity.         
	Talking about Somdev, one has to accept that at 20 years of age, he is the lone hope for Indian tennis. He is winning matches, has attitude, tenacity, consistency and heart, all the major factors needed to climb to the top-100.         
	Somdev could easily add 8/10lbs of muscle over the year with a top-class trainer. The additional strength will build his stamina, add power and depth to his well grooved ground shots, and speed on his serve.         
	This is not all. He needs to be guided by a top coach in top tournaments. The British LTA put in Rs. 8.5 crores to help Murray for just one year. Surely the AITA can sponsor or find sponsors who will chip in for Rs. 3-4 crores for two years.         
	Paes knows the path to the top and he could monitor and navigate Somdevs career. Half-hearted attempts, trimming costs, bickering about little things is a sure route to failure. If India wants a presence in the top-100, Somdev needs to be backed to the hilt, losses and setbacks have to be accepted by promoters and the objective pursued with greater resolve.         
	Somdev is a product of the competitive high-quality intercollegiate tennis system in the US. Jasjit Singh, Sashi Menon and Mahesh Bhupathi, who sharpened their games and attitude on the intercollegiate circuit, have made vital contributions to India in Davis Cup matches.         
	If Indian tennis is to progress, it has to accept the figures prevalent internationally for training and putting players in the top-100, and arrange for sponsorships or the funds.         
	The requirement is no Wall Street meltdown, with a $700 billion bail out.         
	It is a piffling amount. Emerging India has to recalibrate its mind to the burgeoning cost of sports sponsorship and the rich harvest it can reap.

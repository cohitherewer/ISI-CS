The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sanjay Jagdale accepts key BCCI post
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sanjay Jagdale accepts key BCCI post
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Jagdale                           
	Calcutta: The outgoing senior national selector from Central, Sanjay Jagdale, will be the next joint secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	That Jagdale had been offered the key post by the ruling Sharad Pawar group was reported by The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	After giving the matter some thought, Ive given my consent... Im looking forward to the new role, the Indore-based Jagdale said on Wednesday evening.         
	Jagdale, who has served as the India manager more than once, is the secretary of the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association and has played quite a bit of first-class cricket.         
	Soft-spoken and known to be absolutely meticulous, Jagdale is going to succeed Punjabs Mohinder Pandove, who is only a few days away from becoming the BCCI treasurer.         
	According to the intra-Pawar group understanding, the current treasurer, Tamil Nadus N.Srinivasan, will become the secretary. Niranjan Shah (Saurashtra), whose term is getting over, is going to be suitably accommodated. He wont, however, be an office-bearer.         
	Pawar (Mumbai) will, of course, himself be succeeded by Vidarbhas Shashank Manohar. The next president and joint secretary are, therefore, both going to be from the same zone.         
	Meanwhile, one learns that Barodas Chirayu Amin will continue as vice-president from West. The question mark over Souths man, though, continues. The buzz is that Dayanand Narvekar (Goa) could have to make way for Hyderabads Shivlal Yadav.         
	As already mentioned in these columns, Delhis Arun Jaitley is going to be the vice-president from North, Tripuras Arindam Ganguly will be Easts new man, with Rajasthans Lalit Modi sitting in the vice-presidents chair for Central.         
	At the moment, despite heading an affiliate from Central, Modi is Norths representative on the panel of vice-presidents.         
	Some days remain for the September 27-28 AGM in Mumbai and, so, changes in the script are possible. However, its not very likely.

	London: Chelsea ground staff and Manchester United players were involved in a bizarre fracas on the pitch in an almost deserted Stamford Bridge stadium after Saturdays Premier League match between the two teams.         
	None of the United players who started the match were involved but Patrice Evra, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Gerard Pique and substitute John Shea were all warming down when an argument began with the ground staff tending the pitch.         
	Stewards quickly moved in to separate those involved but after the situation quietened down the row flared up again, although no punches were thrown.         
	The incident came a few minutes after Chelsea beat Manchester United 2-1 to pull level with United at the top of the table.         
	A Chelsea spokesman told reporters: We will be studying the CCTV footage of the incident and take whatever action is appropriate. (Reuters)

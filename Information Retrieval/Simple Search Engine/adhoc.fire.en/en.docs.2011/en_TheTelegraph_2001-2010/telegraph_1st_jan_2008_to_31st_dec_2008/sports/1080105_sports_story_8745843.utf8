                                                Duo ready for tough match
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Its difficult to imagine the showdown had not crossed their minds  the best of friends on the ATP Tour  during the second round stage itself.         
	Well, if they thought about it, now they must face it.         
	Both Rafael Nadal and Carlos Moya admitted that it was going to be a tough match. Tough may be for them, but the Chennai crowd wont complain to watch the world No. 2 Spaniard take on former world No. 1 and compatriot Moya in the semi-finals of the Chennai Open.         
	Yeah It is going to be a tough match, Nadal said in broken English after demolishing Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in a late night quarter final on Friday.         
	Both of us, we have played each other so many times we also practise together. It will be a nice match, a very interesting match, the three-time French Open champion said.         
	Among the six times the duo from Mallorca have met each other, Nadal leads 4-2.         
	Moya, who had earlier won against Florent Serra, said almost the same thing when asked about the clash.         
	Its going to be a very tough match for me but I have nothing to lose, he said.

	I am a right-arm mediumpacer. Despite my best efforts and coachs advice I fail to keep the position of the seam upright when delivering the ball. Please help.  
	(Debarshi Mukherjee, 16, Calcutta-40)              
	Check with your coach your wrist position. That might help.                 
	I am a righthanded batsman. I always get bowled to a yorker which is directed at the middle stump. Why does this happen?  
	(Abhishek Sen, 13, Burdwan)              
	Watch the ball and curtail your backlift.                 
	 I am a lefthanded batsman. Whenever I try to play the sweep against a spinner the ball always hits my pads. Please help.  
	(Sayantan Sinha, 15, Calcutta-19)              
	You are getting too close to the pitch of the ball when your pads are in line. Hence the problem.                 
	I am a righthanded batsman. I always fail to flick the ball when it is pitched around the middle or leg stump. I end up getting bowled. Please help.  
	(Vishal Chawla, 19, Howrah-6)  
	You are obviously looking to play the ball away from the body.                 
	I am a righthanded batsman. Whenever I try to hit a pacer over the bowlers head I end up getting caught and bowled. Please help.   
	(Prantik Roy, 17, Calcutta-21)               
	You are getting too close to the pitch of the ball and hence not getting the elevation.                 
	I am a mediumpacer. I often end up bowling a wide when trying an outswinger. Please help.   
	(Samir Dey, 15, Calcutta )              
	Make sure your head is not bobbing over the place at the time of delivery. Also look at the spot you want the ball to land at the time of delivery.               
	I am a righthanded batsman. I often misjudge the balls that are to be left outside the off-stump. What rule should I follow when judging such balls?              
	(Roktim Basu, 19, Calcutta-41)              
	Take a guard that allows you to know exactly where your off stump is.                 
	I am a righthanded batsman. I am often adjudged leg before against leg breaks? Please help  
	(Rohit Das, 18, Calcutta-16)               
	The only problem I think you have is that you are expecting the ball to turn too much.                 
	I am a righthanded batsman. Is it wise to take guard outside the leg stump when facing leg spinners?  
	(Sunil Saha, 17, Calcutta-42)              
	Its really not necessary. You could open up your stance a bit when playing a leggie bowling round the wicket.                 
	I am a righthanded batsman. I often get caught at backward short leg or bowled round the legs when playing a leg-spinner. Please help.  
	(Roktim Banerjee, 16, Calcutta )  
	Check your guard and make sure you open up your stance when playing the leggie.

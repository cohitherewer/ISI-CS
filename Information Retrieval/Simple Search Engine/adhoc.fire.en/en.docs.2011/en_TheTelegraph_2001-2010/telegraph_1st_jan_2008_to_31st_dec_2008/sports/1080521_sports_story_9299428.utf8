	New Delhi: For young drag-flicker Sandeep Singh, the Azlan Shah hockey tournament, was a perfect platform to make a statement. Hounded out of the national team for the Olympic qualifiers for his alleged lack of fitness, Sandeep grabbed the opportunity in Malaysia to prove his class.         
	On Tuesday, when the national hockey team was given a rousing welcome for finishing runners-up in Azlan Shah, Sandeep was at the centre of attraction. But he was in no mood to discuss about the past. I dont want to remember the past, said Sandeep. I am happy that I could prove my critics wrong.         
	After scoring nine goals from penalty corners, Sandeep was the top scorer in the tournament. I gained by playing the domestic circuit. I had done well in domestic hockey and was just waiting for an opportunity. It was nice to play the entire duration and not just fill in for someone. I am glad that my drag flick worked. I still need to work on my drag flick timing and accuracy.         
	Former India captain and team manager Pargat Singh acknowledged that Sandeep has played a significant role in the tournament but requires to improve in some departments. He was good But he needs to improve and I know he can. He has to work on different angles and agility, said Pargat.         
	And A.K. Bansal, who coached the senior nation team for the first time, was confident that the present lot of boys could be developed into a good side.

	Calcutta: Where meetings go, it was quite emotional: Bollywood badshah Shah Rukh Khan running into his childhood cricket idol, keeper Farokh Engineer, quite easily one of Indian crickets first pin-up boys.         
	Shah Rukh, the Kolkata Knight Riders owner, and Farokh met before the start of the teams first home match at the Eden, on Sunday afternoon.         
	Im honoured that Shah Rukh idolised me What else can I say? He didnt know Id be here Shah Rukh, in fact, told me that I was the favourite of his parents too That, for them, Indian cricket meant Farokh Engineer, Farokh told The Telegraph, obviously quite touched.         
	The other day, Shah Rukh (a wicketkeeper in school) had this to say about Farokh in an interview to this Newspaper: He had style, plus Farokh and Shah Rukh kind of rhymed together         
	One of the Match Referees in the Indian Premier League, Farokh added: Its nice that Shah Rukh has renewed ties between cricket and the film industry in such a big way The Kapoors (Shashi was a classmate in Mumbai) were my favourites when I was young As for Shah Rukh, Ive watched some of his films and, clearly, hes immensely talented Besides, what a fine gentleman         
	Farokh, who has settled in England for decades, fondly recalled his association with the Eden.         
	As third umpire Asad Rauf briefed him (in the Match Officials box) on some of the technical issues, Farokh said: Yes, I have nostalgic memories of our sensational win over the West Indies on New Years day in 1975 That match saw some incredible performances, both with the bat and the ball         
	Great captaincy by Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi too.

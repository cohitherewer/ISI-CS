The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My salute to a champion

            Guest Column - Arun Lal    
	I was taken aback, surprised too, by Sourav Gangulys decision to quit after the series versus Australia. Initially it came as sort of a shock because I know for a fact that he desired to play a little longer.         
	All these decisions to call it a day and move on are very personal. In a sense, the circumstances are different for every individual. Thats because in the early days as you get along it is only cricket. But as you grow older there is the family to think about and various other business interests.         
	You also start thinking about your future after the game and how to time it. Moreover, the body doesnt recover as quickly as it used to.         
	The feeling that you have achieved everything also comes along the way. Im not suggesting it has been the same with Sourav. A lot of pressure plays on a cricketer and I am sure some of it has played on his mind, too.         
	Theres definitely a sadness attached to the decision but I realise that all good things have to come to an end. When you think of it rationally, it is a good decision because a player of his magnitude and stature should go out on a high. Thats my perception.         
	But having said that, I also feel that theres no disrespect in being dropped. The only guarantee you have when selected is that one day you will be dropped.         
	I think the decision was very well timed and couldnt have been delayed any further.         
	Sourav is one person who has been surprising one and all right through his career. I have been a fan of his since he was 13. I would say he has surpassed all my expectations as well.         
	Remember when he was first selected, he had very few supporters like me. More articles were written on why he didnt warrant a selection to the side. How wrong they were!         
	His magnificent record and contribution to the country is beyond statistics. That is the respect you want from your colleagues and peers. It means he has always put the interests of the team and country first.         
	Technically, Sourav may not be copybook, but one would travel miles to see him for his class, grace and talent. As a captain, he was unrivalled, not only for his win-loss ratio, but also for his contribution to the game.         
	While I didnt think much of the shirt waving spectacle, he did bring the much-needed aggression and a will to win into the side. His leadership inculcated that focus of how everything should revolve around achieving victory and in that endeavour he backed the right horses and for the right reasons. His judgement was always immaculate and with the larger picture in sight.         
	Not many can have an innings like Sourav and he should sit back and feel satisfied with what he has achieved for himself and the country. I would say its a well thought out decision. He has been through a lot in the last two/three years. He had to fight a tough battle, and in the process came out the better. Even somebody like me thought it was the end, but he bounced back in a spectacular fashion in in 2006.         
	I wish and pray he has the series of his life against Australia. Not for anything else, but only because he deserves it. I was a fan then and am a fan now.

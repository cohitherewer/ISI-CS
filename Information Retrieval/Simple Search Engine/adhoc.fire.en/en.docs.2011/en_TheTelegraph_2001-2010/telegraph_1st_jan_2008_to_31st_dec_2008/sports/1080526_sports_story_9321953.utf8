            A STAFF REPORTER            Umar Gul at the Eden on Sunday                           
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders needed special heroics on Sunday from captain Sourav Ganguly and Pakistan speedster Umar Gul to chase down the highest Indian Premier League total registered at Eden Gardens in their last match of the inaugural edition. Both Gul and Ganguly appeared satisfied with their efforts and earned a word of praise from the visiting captain.         
	These were what the players had to say during the prize distribution:         
	SOURAV GANGULY: This season has been a learning experience for us. I think we have let the supporters and the franchise down. May be next season we will come back a stronger team. Gul had already hit a couple of big sixes in the IPL. So I just told him to stay still and keep swinging his bat.         
	YUVRAJ SINGH: We had the game in our hands till the last four overs. Sourav batted really well He stayed till the end. The positive from this game was that it was our best fielding effort. Rajasthan are above us and are No.1 in the table. If we beat them it would be great.         
	In the last few matches we had not been fielding well So our performance in the field on Sunday has been praiseworthy. Apart from that our bowlers have been bowling really well in the tournament. And even today, but for the last few overs they placed the ball in the right areas. So there are a lot of positives to be taken from this game.         
	UMAR GUL: May be next time Shah Rukh will move me up in the batting order. It was great playing at Eden Gardens. The crowd has supported us throughout the tournament.         
	We didnt do well tournament. It was a combination of bad luck and poor performances. Inshallah we will come back and win the trophy next year.

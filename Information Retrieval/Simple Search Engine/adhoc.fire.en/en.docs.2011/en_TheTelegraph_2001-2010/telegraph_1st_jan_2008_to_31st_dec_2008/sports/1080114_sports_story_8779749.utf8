                                                   Clarke: Wish Id walked off

      SHARP SINGLE 
        
	 Michael Clarke is embarrassed at having stood his ground in Sydney and has made it clear that he may react differently in a similar situation next time. 
    
	In my heart, I wish I had just walked off, Clarke was quoted as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald on Sunday. 
    
	I hope it doesnt happen again I hope I dont get too many golden ducks in Test cricket. I am definitely not saying I am a walker, but if a similar incident happens again I am certain I would react differently. 
    
	Clarke called up Kumble after arriving in Perth on Saturday night to explain that he stayed at the crease because he was shocked and disappointed at himself after scoring his first golden duck in Tests. 
    
	He (Kumble) knows I am not the type to try and harm the game. 
    
	The last thing I would want is to put the game of cricket in jeopardy. 
     
	Matthews slams Ponting
 
	 Former Australia spinner Greg Matthews lashed out at Ricky Ponting for turning down Anil Kumbles peace offer to solve the racism row and said such a thing would not have happened under Mark Taylor. This would never have happened under Taylor, the former off-spinner said. One single phone call, one act of humility from our leader or from CAs bosses would have resolved everything. How did it get to this stage? Matthews told The Sunday Telegraph. He added: I am truly amazed that someone in a position of power at CA just didnt say to Ricky, have a talk to Anil and sort this out for the good of the game. Why didnt that happen? 
     
	Akram warns India
 
	 Pakistan great Wasim Akram has warned Indian batsmen to be on their guard to survive an Australian pace onslaught at the worlds fastest pitch, the Waca, in the third Test starting Wednesday. I believe its (the pitch) a throwback to the 70s and 80s when it only used to fly around the eye level and above, remarked Akram, busy with TV commentary on the current tour. Most importantly, they need to really field well. On that sort of surface, catching can play a big role, as well as good ground fielding. Australian Test hopeful Chris Rogers said the real struggle is to make the first 20 runs and thereafter the batsmen can begin to have a feel of the surface. 
     
	Hogg to invoke Sir Edmund Hillary
 
	 Bradd Hogg, in the thick of controversy for allegedly abusing Anil Kumble and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, will invoke the spirit of a remark made by late mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary when he seeks to clear himself of the charge at a hearing by the ICC on Monday. 
    
	Hogg will argue that he meant no malice, in the same way that Hillary had famously quipped after coming down from the summit of Everest, we knocked the b****** off, according to Australias Daily Telegraph.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nothing wrong with ICC-ICL meeting: BCCI
                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which has banned players who took part in the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL), on Saturday said it had no issues with the upcoming meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) chief David Morgan and ICL owner Subhash Chandra.         
	Theres nothing wrong in that meeting. Mr Morgan will give details of what was discussed at his meeting with Mr Subash Chandra at the ICC meeting scheduled on October 14 and 15 in Dubai, said BCCI president Shashank Manohar just hours after taking over the reins from Sharad Pawar on Saturday.         
	Manohar also dismissed reports of the Sri Lankan board allowing its ICL-aligned players to play in the island nations domestic cricket by saying it was an internal matter.         
	Its an internal matter of Sri Lanka Cricket and we have nothing do with it, he replied curtly to a query on the subject in his first media conference after becoming the BCCI chief.         
	Manohar also dismissed BCCI CAO Ratnakar Shettys statement to a television channel about the Rajasthan Cricket Associations way of obliging Australian cricketers as his private opinion.         
	On Friday, Pawar too set aside notions in the wake of Shettys criticism that the BCCI was not happy with the top-class training facilities afforded to the Australians at Jaipur.         
	The BCCI is not unhappy. They are our guests and as per our Indian tradition we extend our hospitality to the visiting guests, he said on the raging debate.           (PTI)

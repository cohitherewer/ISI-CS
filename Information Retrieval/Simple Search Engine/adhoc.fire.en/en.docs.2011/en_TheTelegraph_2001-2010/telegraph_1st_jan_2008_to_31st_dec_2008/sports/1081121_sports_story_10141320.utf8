	Margao: Mohun Bagan came from behind to beat a spirited Vasco Sports Club 2-1, registering their fourth successive win in the ONGC I-League on Thursday.         
	Vasco took the lead in the 29th minute through Lalnua Puia. However, Rakesh Masih (31st) and Lalkamal (53rd) Bhowmik poured water on the hosts hopes of an upset.         
	A long lob kept out by goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee deflected to Puia, who chipped the ball into the net from the top of the box.         
	Bagan equalised in the 31st minute when Marcos Pereira directed the ball to Rakesh off a free kick. Rakeshs back-header found the net to have both the teams tied 1-1 at half-time.         
	Bagan scored the winner in the 53rd minute. Jose Ramirez Barreto sent a pass for substitute Lalkamal who got the better of defender Elvino Fernandes before essaying a left footer that found the roof of the net.

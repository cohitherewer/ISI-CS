  - Raleng nets three as Services reach Santosh Trophy final after 39 years       JAYDEEP BASU            Action during the Bengal-Services Santosh Trophy semi-final match on Thursday. (PTI)                                 
	Srinagar: Services hit Bengal soccer where it hurts the most  pride.         
	Bengals soccer prestige lay in tatters on the Bakshi Stadium turf on Thursday when the 29-time champions were routed 4-1 by Services in the semi-final of the Santosh Trophy.         
	Twenty-year-old Manipuri striker Sochungmi Raleng did the star turn once again for the Services as his three-goal blitz tore the Bengal defence apart.         
	Rarely before in the history of the national championships Bengal had been mauled so badly, that, too by an institutional side. The last time Services made the final was in 1969 at Nowgong where they were thrashed 6-1 by Bengal.         
	The story, however, was altogether different on Thursday. It was Bengal who were at the receiving end. They remained distinctly lucky not to concede a couple of more goals, especially in the second half.         
	To say Bengals performance was pathetic would be an understatement. They looked like taking a stroll in the park and not too bothered with the Services mauling.         
	Though Bengal conceded the last two goals on counter attacks during the closing stages, overall, they were totally outplayed on the pitch.         
	It took Bengal 75 minute to make their first positive move when substitute Asim Das shot over from close ranges.         
	Sochungmi Raleng is definitely the find of the tournament. He remained the architect of Services giant killing run throughout the meet and it was no exception against Bengal. The Bengal defenders had a harrowing time against the speedy striker, who put his team ahead in the 26th minute off a rebound. It was the best of my three goals, Raleng said later. I could never dream that I would score 13 goals in Santosh Trophy.         
	Bengal showed no sense of urgency after conceding the goal and continued to play in a lackluster manner. A panicky Bengal coach Krishnendu Roy pushed in all his substitute forwards  Asim Das and Shankar Oraon  but did not yield any positive result.         
	Norgen Lama put Services 2-0 ahead with a terrific 30-yard free kick in the 78th minute before Lalkamal Bhowmick made it 1-2 a minute later.         
	But that was all Bengal could do as Raleng fired two salvos in the 89th and 90th minute to leave the former champions running for cover.         
	TEAMS

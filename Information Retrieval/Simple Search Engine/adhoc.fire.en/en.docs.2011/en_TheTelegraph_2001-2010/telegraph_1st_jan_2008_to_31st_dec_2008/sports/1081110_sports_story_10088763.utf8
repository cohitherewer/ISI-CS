	Calcutta: Bengal will aim for a positive start when they open their Ranji Trophy campaign against Madhya Pradesh in Gwalior on Monday.         
	Bengal, whose first match against Assam in Guwahati was cancelled due to security reasons after the bomb blast, will miss the services of left-arm spinner Sourasish Lahiri and Rohan Banerjee.         
	Bengals chances will depend on the performance of Manoj Tiwary, besides the three pacers  Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul and Ashok Dinda.

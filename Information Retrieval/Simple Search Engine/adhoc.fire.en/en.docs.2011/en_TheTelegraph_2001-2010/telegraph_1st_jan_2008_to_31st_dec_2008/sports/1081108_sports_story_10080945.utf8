                                                                                                                                                                                           Force India shake-up
                      
	London: Force India owner Vijay Mallya terminated his Formula One teams Ferrari engine contract a year early on Friday while ousting Colin Kolles as principal and Mike Gascoyne as technical head.         
	Force India , who failed to score a point and finished 10th in the constructors championship this year, have thus paved the way for the arrival of Mercedes engines and closer links with McLaren.         
	Mallya will assume the responsibilities of team principal in addition to his position as chairman.         
	Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, has been invited to compete against Michael Schumacher at Wembley Stadium in the annual Race of Champions that will pit competitors from various branches of the sport against each other on December 14.

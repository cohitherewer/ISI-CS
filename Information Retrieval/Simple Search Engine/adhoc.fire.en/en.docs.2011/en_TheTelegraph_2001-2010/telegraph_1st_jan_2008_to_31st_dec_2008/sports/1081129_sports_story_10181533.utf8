                                                                                                                                                                                                     NZ reach 262/6
                      
	New Zealand wasted their opportunity as they threw away their wickets with loose shots to reach 262 for six at stumps on day one of the second Test against Australia in Adelaide on Friday.         
	Aaron Redmond scored 83, according to cricinfo. New Zealand could have been in a worse position had Matthew Hayden, playing his 100th Test, collected a sharp take to his right when Peter Fulton edged Nathan Hauritz on nine.

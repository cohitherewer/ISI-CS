Excluded at first, Ohuruogu wins gold for Britain | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Excluded at first, Ohuruogu wins gold for Britain 
                      
	BEIJING, Aug 19 (AP): After winning a court battle to overturn a lifetime Olympic ban for a doping violation, Christine Ohuruogu kept her composure and kicked at the end to deliver Britain a gold medal in the womens 400 meters that it almost deprived itself.               
	And just like her selection, she didnt look like shed make it until close to the end.               
	The 24-year-old Briton from east London powered around the final bend in fourth place and surged ahead on the last stretch Tuesday when pacesetter Sanya Richards started fading.               
	She hit the front with 30 meters to go and won in 49.62 seconds, with Jamaicas Shericka Williams finishing strong for the silver medal and Richards being relegated to bronze.               
	Despite being banned for 12 months for missing three out-of-competition doping tests between October 2005 and July 2006, Ohuruogu won the world championship in Osaka, Japan, last August barely weeks after returning to competition. She won the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, in March 2006.               
	The British Olympic Association rules automatically make any athlete banned for a doping violation ineligible for the Olympics.               
	As far as Ohuruogu is concerned, shes served her time.               
	 quot;Why should it be spoiled, unless someone tries to spoil it for me, quot; Ohuruogu replied to the inevitable question of her medal being tainted. quot;Im very happy I picked up three gold medals from three championships and, as far as Im concerned, nothing can spoil that. quot;               
	Ohuruogu won her appeal against the BOA ban in November in a sports arbitration panel, which decided there were mitigating circumstances.               
	She had been the first British athlete banned for missing three out-of-competition doping tests. She has always denied being a drug cheat, saying she was frequently tested and the missed tests were the result of changing her training timetable.               
	Elite athletes are supposed to account for their whereabouts at all times so they can be subjected to unannounced, random testing.               
	UK Athletics said she was guilty of a technical offense and welcomed her onto the Beijing Olympics team, but her achievements have consistently been overshadowed.               
	 quot;I dont really care what people think or say, quot; Ohuruogu said. quot;As far as I am concerned, I am here and Ive won a gold medal. And thats all I care about today.               
	 quot;Im very proud. Ive worked very hard, getting to the championships, Ive kept my head up. quot;               
	Her coach, Lloyd Cowan, said the off-track dramas had steeled Ohuruogu. He said Ohuruogu almost felt as if she was locked up.               
	 quot;Holding her together was the strongest thing, quot; he said. quot;She gets training in the morning, finishes at 12. She goes home. She sleeps. She doesnt want to see nobody, quot; he told The Associated Press. quot;For one whole year she did that. Thats the hardest thing. She didnt want to get on the train. She didnt want to do this. Basically, I think it made her a stronger athlete.               
	 quot;To win the world championship last year, that showed me she had the mentality ... Today, was her day. quot;               
	Cowan said the testing procedure did not allow for flexibility.               
	 quot;They could turn up at your house ... you say youre at the track at 10 and change to go somewhere else, and they turn up and dont call you, quot; he said. quot;All you do is get a letter in the post that you missed a test. Thats it. Thats how we roll in the UK.               
	 quot;Lets get it straight. You can go training at a park and come in, and if they turn up at the venue youre (expected) to be, youre not there, they dont ring saying, Oh were here waiting for you. quot;               
	Cowan said one time Ohuruogu changed training locations was because there was a school sports carnival for 500 children at the scheduled venue. Another time, she was doing a photo shoot for a newspaper.               
	 quot;Simple, little mistakes, quot; he said. quot;Will never happen again. quot;               
	Ohuruogu was raised in the area of east London which is being regenerated to host the 2012 Olympics. And while shed like to be there, making the most of the hometown advantage, shes not giving any guarantees. Shed like some time to get over a tumultuous buildup to Beijing.               
	 quot;Its literally on my doorstep. Its where I grew up, quot; she said. But quot;its four years away, another cycle ... well see. quot;

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pindi Stadium will be ready, says PCB
                                                                                                                                                                                           CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Pindi Stadium will be ready, says PCB   
	Karachi: Unfazed by the criticism surrounding the slow pace of renovation at the Rawalpindi Stadium, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday said the venue  that will host five matches of next months Champions Trophy  would be ready by August 20.  
	A senior official of the board said that the stadium would be up to international standards and ready to host the Champions Trophy.         
	The Pindi Stadium, which is undergoing massive renovation for the eight-nation tournament, will host five matches including the high-profile Pakistan versus Australia game and one semi-final.         
	There has been concern that the renovation work at the stadium might not be completed before the deadline, but Shafqat Naghmi, PCB Chief Operating Officer, who paid an inspection visit to the venue, said it was well on course to be ready by August 20.         
	ECB decision         
	 Karachi: The ecb has put off its decision on sending the England cricket team for Champions Trophy in Pakistan by a week as it is yet to receive a report on the security situation in the troubled country from an international cricket council-instituted special task force.         
	The ecb met on Monday in which the Champions Trophy was also discussed and it was decided a final decision should be taken after seven to 10 days.         
	Aaqibs view         
	 Karachi: Former Pakistan pacer Aaqib Javed believes the International Cricket Council (ICC) needs to play a more proactive role in ensuring all the top teams take part in the Champions Trophy in Pakistan next month as no place in the world is safe today.         
	Aaqib said the ICC needed to put its foot down against the teams and players raising the security issue and are averse to travelling to Pakistan.         
	These things are now part of our lives and we have to live with them. There have been some blasts in China as well with the Olympics starting this week. Life has to go on, he said.         
	Test delayed         
	 Karachi: Pakistan pacer Mohammed Asifs efforts to get a visa to travel to Switzerland for his B sample test met with failure on Monday with the embassy officials advising him to apply afresh for new travel dates.         
	Asifs lawyer Shahid Karim confirmed that they sent another email to the Indian Premier League organisers asking them to extend the date for the B sample test.         
	Ireland qualify         
	 Belfast: Ireland became the first team to qualify for next years World Twenty20 championships in England after labouring to a four-wicket victory over Kenya in the first semi-final of the qualifying tournament at Stormont here on Monday.         
	After taking the hardest possible road to the semi-final stage thanks to a last-gasp win over Bermuda on Sunday, Ireland bowled well to knock the African side over for 67 in 17.2 overs.

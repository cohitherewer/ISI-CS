The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spurs knock out Liverpool
                                                                                                                                                                                           Spurs knock out Liverpool
                      
	London: Defending champions Tottenham Hotspur reached the League Cup quarter finals with a 4-2 defeat of a below-strength Liverpool at White Hart Lane with two goals apiece for Roman Pavlyuchenko and Fraizer Campbell on Wednesday.         
	Blackburn Rovers won 2-1 away at fellow top-flight side Sunderland.         
	Pavlyuchenko opened the scoring after 38 minutes. Campbell made it 2-0 when he capitalised on a mix-up between Cavalieri and Andrea Dossena. On the stroke of half time Campbell struck again.         
	Liverpool made a match of it in the second half with headed goals from Damien Plessis and Sami Hyypia either side of Pavlyuchenkos second.         
	The London Metropolitan police, meanwhile, are investigating an incident involving Chelsea striker Didier Drogba. Drogba had thrown a coin into the crowd while celebrating his first goal of the season.         
	I tried to celebrate the goal and I received some things at me, he said. The big mistake I did was to throw it back so if someone was hurt I just want to apologise for it.

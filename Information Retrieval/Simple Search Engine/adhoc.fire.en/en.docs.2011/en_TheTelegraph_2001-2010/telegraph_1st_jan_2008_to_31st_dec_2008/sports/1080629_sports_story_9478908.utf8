The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hamilton stays positive
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hamilton stays positive

	Lewis Hamilton has said that he would put the hammer down for the rest of the Formula One season to win races and wrest the title from Ferrari.         
	They are strong just everywhere but so are we, the 23-year-old Briton said ahead of his home Grand Prix at Silverstone next week. I really think the next 10 races, the second part of the season, is really when we put the hammer down and when we rise above the rest.         
	The McLaren driver led the championship after winning the Monaco Grand Prix last month, but has failed to score points in his last two outings. Hamilton, who lost the title battle to Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen by a single point last year, is now fourth overall in the standings, which are led by Ferraris Felipe Massa.         
	Youve got to learn to take a step back and realise: OK, you dont have to do anything, just drive the way you normally drive and you will be fine, you will get by, Hamilton said after racing model cars with patients from Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children.         
	With a bit of luck we will pull together as a team and win this championship. And I feel better prepared than ever before to win this championship, so even though it is very close it makes it more exciting for me and for the team and the world watching.         
	Raikkonen won at Silverstone last season after Hamilton, who finished third, had taken pole position on his first Formula One race appearance in front of his home fans.         
	Last year it was incredible how much support I had, said Hamilton. This year its even more, so I am even more nervous but excited at the same time. But I know it will give me a lot of good vibes.         
	Hamilton said he had not been affected by setbacks in Canada, where he drove into the back of Raikkonens stationary Ferrari in the pit lane, and in France where he was penalised 10 places on the starting grid and then handed a drive-through penalty in the race.         
	Its just part of the learning curve, he said. You have your ups and downs and in life we expect to have ups and downs and if you dont then thats not reality. I am sure I havent met my toughest time in my life as yet but all of this is preparing me for it.

	Calcutta: East Bengal crashed out of the IFA Shield after a 1-1 draw with Santos FC at the Howrah stadium on Monday. The red-and-gold brigade needed to win by at least three goals against the South African side to stay alive in the tournament. Santos and Mahindra qualified for the semi-finals from this group. 
    
	East Bengal enjoyed more of the ball possession but failed to open the goalmouth after being outnumbered inside the penalty box. Santos coach Duncan Crowie blamed lack of ball possession for his game plan going out of the window, but the youngsters, nonetheless, were impressive. 
    
	The South Africans looked like emerging runaway winners after opening the scoreline in as early as the seventh minute through Gregory Michael Roelf. East Bengal equalised through an Edmilson penalty seven minutes later. 
    
	East Bengal took charge of the proceedings thereafter mainly because of hardworking Syed Rahim Nabi and Alvito DCunha. But with none to complement their efforts, the Santos defenders didnt have much to worry about. 
    
	Santoss goal was a culmination of three passes. Elton Jonathan Swatz put Clifton Davids up on the right, after the latter had foxed the rival defenders with a dummy run. The resultant cross was nodded in by Roelf. 
    
	East Bengal equalised after an onrushing Abeku Gaisy was brought down inside the box by the rival goalkeeper. Referee Aarjunan has no hesitation in pointing to the dreaded spot. 
    
	Mehrajuddin was replaced by Mehtab Hossain during the closing 15 minutes. East Bengal did open up the goalmouth during this period with Nabi failing to put the ball into an open goal.

                                                                                                                                                                                           Prakash falls   at final hurdle
                            
	New Delhi: Prakash Amritrajs dream run at the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships came to an end after second seed and defending champion Frabrice Santoro handed a straight-set defeat to the Indian wildcard in the finals of the $385,000 event in Newport (as reported in Mondays Late City edition) .         
	Prakash went down 3-6, 5-7 in a one-hour-15-minute combat against his French rival, who became only the third player in the history of the tournament to defend his title. Disappointment for India prevailed in the doubles competition as well with fourth seeds Rohan Bopanna and his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi losing 4-6, 6-7 (1-7) to the unseeded American duo of Mardy Fish and John Isner in the finals.         
	Playing each other for the first time, Prakash and Santoro broke serve in the first two games, but later it was Santoro who seized control with a second break of Prakashs serve for a 3-1 lead.         
	The 35-year-old wrapped up the first set in 30 minutes, winning 18 of the 27 service points. He did not serve with much pace and these courts are soft. The ball stays very low and thus made it hard to return, Prakash said           (PTI)

                                                2 Russian rowers banned
                      
	Lausanne: Two Russian rowers received two-year bans on Wednesday for using prohibited intravenous injections at last years World Rowing Championships. Anastassia Fatina and Anastasia Karabelshchikova were banned by the International Rowing Federation following an investigation that has already resulted in six other Russian rowers receiving bans.         
	The athletes were identified through DNA analysis as having intravenously infused substances for a non-legitimate acute medical reason, Fisa said in a statement.         
	Fisa did not indicate that the substances injected were themselves illegal.         
	Fisa said it was now considering whether to ban the entire Russian Rowing Federation from taking part in the Beijing Olympics this summer. (AP)

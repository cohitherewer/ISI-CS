The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United kick off season in style
                                                                                                                                                                                                     United kick off season in style
                                  
	London: Champions Manchester United won the Community Shield, the traditional curtain-raiser to the English season, 3-1 on penalties after a 0-0 draw against FA Cup winners Portsmouth at Wembley on Sunday.         
	It was the third time in 12 months that United have secured silverware with a shootout victory after beating Chelsea in the Community Shield a year ago and, more importantly, the Champions League final in Moscow in May.         
	Despite playing without their main strike force of Cristiano Ronaldo (ankle surgery) and Wayne Rooney (virus), United dominated a largely pedestrian match and should have wrapped it up before the penalties followed at the end of normal time.         
	Carlos Tevez, Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick finally found the net in the shootout while Jermain Defoe was Portsmouths only scorer.         
	Lassana Diarra fired Portsmouths first spot kick high over the bar while Arnold Mvuembas shot was saved by Edwin van der Sar. Glen Johnson, who with Diarra was in the Chelsea side beaten by United a year ago, handed Alex Fergusons side victory by also firing his shot over the bar.         
	United have won the Shield 13 times outright since their first victory when the match was first staged exactly 100 years ago. Sunday was only the third time the game has failed to produce a goal.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indias performance left me shocked, says Ranatunga
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -   Former captain on Sri Lankas success in the Asia Cup and beyond         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            Arjuna Ranatunga    
	Karachi: The 1996 World Cup-winning captain, Arjuna Ranatunga, who now heads Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), spoke to The Telegraph over breakfast at the Pearl Continental here on Monday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Sunday saw the teams first success in a tournament after youve taken over as the SLC chairman         
	A All credit must go to the boys They deserve to be congratulated and Im so happy that (Ajantha) Mendis didnt feel the nerves It was his first real big match and he was brilliant If you look back, youll find that all our top batters were in form Then, (Muttiah) Muralidharan and Mendis proved to be a handful         
	What, in your opinion, made the biggest difference in the Asia Cup?         
	The team effort Batters, bowlers         
	Did Team Indias capitulation in the final take you by surprise?         
	Indias performance left me shocked, not surprised The batsmen just couldnt pick Mendis, when theyre supposed to be good against spinners I must confess I was surprised when (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni decided to field I know that some of the biggest names dont like the pressure of chasing (in a final) Also, India wouldve known that we would field two spinners The National Stadium wickets had become slower and had begun to turn as well.         
	Frankly, how did you expect the final to unfold?         
	Id thought both teams had an equal chance, 50-50 Even at 66 for four, we kept our nerves What amazed me is that the Indians kept bowling to Sanath Jayasuriyas strength Hes not new to the sport and they shouldve been looking to exploit his weaknesses. Instead, they kept feeding Sanath Allowed him to cut and hook and go for the lofted drives I quite liked Ishant Sharma, but he bowled two good balls and then four bad ones.         
	At the break, what were your thoughts?         
	Well, quite a few people kept saying we were 30-40 short, but I told them to wait and see I also said Muralidharan and Mendis would either win the final for us or give the trophy to India.         
	For somebody so gifted, its surprising that Mendiss debut (in the West Indies) was as recently as April. Why?         
	Thats because he started to perform only last year or so What I recall is that Mendis would trouble even Mahela (Jayawardene) and (Kumar) Sangakkara in provincial cricket I mean our best batters also had problems picking him Now, Im looking forward to seeing Mendis in Test cricket.         
	Mendiss line is immaculate         
	Line and length He lands the ball in the right areas When the left-handers were there, he quickly changed his line Obviously, he thinks.         
	Do you, as the boss, interfere in selection?         
	Not at all.         
	But dont you think the better teams will sort Mendis out rather quickly?         
	They will, I suppose I dont know how soon or late, though The fact is its very difficult to realise what hes bowling. (Adds laughing) At times, I doubt if even Mendis knows what hes doing!         
	Jayasuriya continues to prove that old is gold         
	Hes getting runs and I admire his fitness Having said that, he should know when to leave Today, weve got to look at the next World Cup (2011) and it shouldnt be that Sanath plays till 2010 and then announces retirement.         
	Youve begun to give some of the younger players more opportunities. Is it a conscious move?         
	Weve retained the Asia Cup, yes, but havent done well (in ODIs) over the past year or so In a way, the rebuilding process is on My view is that you cant depend on two or three players For example, the batting cant revolve around Mahela, Sangakkara and Sanath only Chamara Silva, (Tillekaratne) Dilshan and Chamara Kapugedera clearly have to accept more responsibility         
	Your thoughts on Mahela as captain?         
	Hes been doing well, but I was taken aback when he took Mendis off after just four overs (first spell) I would probably have bowled him through. Mahela, however, deserves kudos for introducing Mendis so early Of course, had that move not come off, then everybody wouldve gone for the captains jugular.         
	Hasnt the win given you all an advantage in the forthcoming home engagements against India?         
	The Test series is going to be very different The wickets wont be the same and the Indians will have the seniors The three-Test series will give us an opportunity to assess where we stand We know the Indian batting line-up is awesome.         
	How did you and the team celebrate?         
	I dont get involved in matters of selection and dont get involved with celebrations either When I was the captain, I didnt like officials coming into the players domain Now that Im an official, I cant do what I never encouraged.         
	Finally, are you enjoying the chairmanship?         
	(Laughs) The cricket board has been Sri Lankas biggest charitable organisation! Im trying to set things right Obviously, overnight, too many changes cant be done.

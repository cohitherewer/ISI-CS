                  Michael Holding                     
	London: West Indies legend Michael Holding has resigned from the International Cricket Council in protest of their decision to convert result of the forfeited 2006 Oval Test between England and Pakistan into a drawn match.         
	The former fast bowler, who is a part of the ICC Cricket Committee, said Pakistans refusal to take the field in that fateful match could not go unpunished.         
	When you take certain actions, you must be quite happy to suffer the consequences. That game should never, ever be a draw, Holding said.         
	I have just written my letter of resignation to the ICC Cricket Committee because I cannot agree with what theyve done, he was quoted as saying in the British media.         
	A lot of things that are happening I dont want to be involved with, so Ive moved on, he added.         
	Pakistan were originally deemed to have forfeited the game after they refused to return to the field following an allegation of ball tampering from umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove.         
	The ICC later cleared them of the ball tampering offence and on Thursday changed the outcome of the match from an England win to a draw.           (PTI)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jeev Milkha Singh                           
	Noida: Jeev Milkha Singh on Friday promised to give his best for the country when he partners Jyoti Randhawa in the World Cup golf to be played in Shenzhen, China from November 27 to 30.         
	We will shine in tandem, said the ace golfer during a function here. We have a fine chance of doing well in China.         
	India have earned a direct qualification for the prestigious tournament for the third time after 2005 and 2007.         
	I am not trying to sound over confident but our prospect in China is bright. Jyoti is a superb player and his experience of playing in the previous World Cups will be of great help.         
	Jeev said he would now play fewer tournaments and wants to keep himself fit to play till the age of 50. He added he wouldnt take part in the Indian Open.         
	I am still nursing an ankle injury, so I will not be able to take part in the Indian Open, Jeev said. May be next year I will be there.         
	Im currently going through rehabilitation where I play two weeks and take the next week off. Its disappointing not to play at home but I cannot take chance, he said.

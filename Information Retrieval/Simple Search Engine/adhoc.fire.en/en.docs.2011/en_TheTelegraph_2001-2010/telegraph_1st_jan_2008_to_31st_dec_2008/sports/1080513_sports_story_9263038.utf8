The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sharapova, WTA compromise 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sharapova, WTA compromise 
                      
	Rome: Maria Sharapova reached a compromise with the WTA Tour and completed a promotional photo shoot before the Italian Open began on Monday.         
	The Russian was opposed to the shoot because she does not like distractions before tournaments, and claimed the WTA threatened to fine her more than $300,000 (euro 200,000) if she refused.         
	The photo shoot was reduced to 90 minutes from several hours, Sharapova said. I was riding around in a car for an hour talking  pretending like Im talking on the phone.

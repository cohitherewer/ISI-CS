The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Now its over to you, London

	The Olympic baton officially passed from China to London on Sunday night, as the Beijing Games closed with another dazzling extravaganza of artistic pageantry.         
	Against an astonishing spectacle of fluorescent light and pyrotechnics in the Birds Nest stadium, Londons Mayor, Boris Johnson, accepted the Olympic flag to signal the start of its four-year reign as host city.         
	However, that reign was immediately pitched into controversy, with a row over an exhibition of British art at the hand-over party in Beijing that included a portrait of the moors murderer Myra Hindley.         
	The symbolic hand-over came in a closing ceremony every bit as sumptuous as the one that opened this sporting opera 17 days ago.         
	Beijing was, once again, the place to befireballs in the sky, high-wire aerial ballet and breathtaking choreography to the rhythm of heavenly drums and a thousand dancers ringing silver bells.         
	London 2012, aware of the futility of trying to outdo a floor show of this magnitude, chose a red double-decker bus as the centrepiece of an segment in which the TV talent show winner Leona Lewis and Jimmy Page attempted to bridge the generational divide with a Led Zeppelin classic.         
	They were joined, in what may yet be his international swansong, by David Beckham booting a football high into the sky.         
	Meanwhile, in a row of iced seats, cooled especially for the politburo and their guests, Gordon Brown surveyed at first hand the scale of Chinas ambition. The Treasury has already committed 9.3 billion; China ploughed more than twice that into a showcase calculated to woo the world.         
	By the time of the after-show party, an effusive Mr Brown was promising London would stage the best games ever, adding: This is a great day for London and for Britain and for the Olympic movement. We can say with one voice it is a great time to be British.         
	As the curtain came down on the 29th Olympiad, focus returned to the business of Chinas long march to parity with the West. All of the people were not fooled all of the time during the Beijing pageant. Only on Sunday, the US fired off a diplomatic missive complaining about the incarceration of two Americans in Beijing for their protests about Tibet.         
	Lord Coe and his 2012 organisers recognise the pointlessness of trying to match the Beijings grandeur.         
	Instead, they will try to ensure the streets of London are free of the stultifying state control that strangled the life out of the Beijing party.         
	They are aiming for a street festival along the lines of Sydney, an inclusive celebration that radiates along all points from Stratford.         
	We take with us to London the memories of Britains thrilling victories, and of the incredible feats in water and on land by Michael Phelps, he of the eight gold medals, and Usain Bolt, the sprinter.         
	Outside the great Chinese dustpan and brush was sweeping up. All aboard for London.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

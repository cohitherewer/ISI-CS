The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Faldos shrink   a key element
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Faldos shrink   a key element

	Valhalla: Nick Faldo has brought his own shrink to Kentucky and, as the Europe captain lurched between smooth Faldo, secretive Faldo, rude Faldo and a few other versions on Wednesday, it was possible to see why Kjell Enhager may be busy.         
	It comes to something when even the team captain requires a psychological prop, but just as the fans look to the team for inspiration and the team look to Faldo, Faldo looks to Enhager to make him the best leader that he can be. Ruffled by his pairings being caught on camera on Wednesday, Faldo may have headed straight for the psychologists couch.         
	It is a measure of Enhagers influence on Faldo that the Englishman has got the Swede to fly over to advise him on how he is handling his captaincy. Enhager is available to the players if they want him, but he has not been formally introduced in the team room and is expected to concentrate purely on the man in charge.         
	The role might best be compared to that of Bill Beswick in Steve McClarens England camp, when the psychologist would be the eyes and ears for the head coach as well as offering personal advice and support. McClaren would turn to Beswick over delicate issues such as the right messages to give to players and public. As results dipped, Beswicks influence on McClaren was questioned in some quarters, but a large number of players testify that he was a positive influence.         
	Faldo has spoken effusively about Enhager, but, perhaps mindful that his shrink knows all his personal and professional demons, he barred the psychologist from speaking to The Times.         
	Faldos relationship with Enhager goes back almost a decade. He was introduced to the former golf professional by Fanny Sunesson, his former caddie, after he had missed the cut at the 1999 Open Championship and was at such a low ebb that he was thinking of quitting the game.         
	Enhager is particularly renowned for his motivational work with successful, driven people who are too hard on themselves, whether in sport or business. Faldo, the perfectionist, would certainly qualify.         
	The psychologist helped a generation of Swedish women golfers, including Annika Sorenstam to make their mark using a concept called 54 vision. At their first meeting, the women had said uniformly that a par round of 72 was a reasonable expectation. Enhager challenged them to think of birdies on every hole.         
	Rockets to the moon, air travel and television are examples of ideas thought to be impossible before they became reality, he told them. In sports, there was Bjorn Borgs two-handed backhand, Jan Boklovs V-style ski jumping and Roger Bannisters sub-four-minute mile. Someone believed in it, drew up the blueprint and dared to be different.         
	Faldo has described Enhagers work as a road map pointing you in the right direction and they have become sufficiently close that the Swede was invited to the golfers third wedding.

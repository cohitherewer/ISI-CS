                                                  Bose, Saha script win
    - Duleep Trophy
  -   East Zone put it across South by 68 runs                   Ranadeb Bose bagged 3/67                           
	Mumbai: East Zone needed only two balls in the post-lunch session to vanquish South Zone by 68 runs on the fourth and final day of their Duleep Trophy league match at the Wankhede Stadium here on Wednesday.         
	Chasing a victory target of 273 after having conceded a lead of 109 runs to their rivals in the first innings, South began the fourth day at 113 for three, requiring 160 more runs to win, but failed miserably in their endeavour.         
	South started the victory run-chase disastrously by losing Murali Vijay, opening the innings in place of the injured Swapnil Asnodkar, edged behind the fourth ball from Mohanty.         
	Ranadeb Bose, the gangling Bengal pacer who made the trip to England with the India squad last year, gave East three breakthroughs to put them on the way to a comprehensive victory.         
	Ranadeb sent back south captain Subramaniam Badrinath, R. Ashwin and Swapnil Asnodkar to end up with three for 67.         
	South Zones main hopes for their only win in the three-team group, rested on Badrinath, unbeaten on 42 last evening, but he departed in the 12th over of the day and gave East the upper hand.         
	The South skipper edged an attempted drive off Bose to give Shiv Sunder Das the chance to pouch the catch in the slip cordon.         
	The dismissals of Badrinath (57) and his statemate R. Ashwin  also by Bose  at the same score of 143 put East in command.         
	Bose then packed off Swapnil to leave South struggling at 171 for six and the tail failed to wag.         
	Palash Das ousted the last two batsmen  N. C. Aiyappa and Pragyan Ojha  in the space of three balls on either side of lunch to send South to their second straight defeat.         
	East will meet North in the last league match in Rajkot from February 11-14 and the winners of that match would reach the title round to be held in Mumbai from February 19-23.         
	South captain Badrinath rued that his team had allowed East to escape twice in the match and blamed the inexperience of his bowling attack as the reasons for the defeat.         
	East Zone medium-pacer Bose said that Badrinaths wicket was the turning point.         
	We knew his wicket was the key as there were not many batsmen after him and he also knew it and was under pressure, he said.         
	Bose, leading wicket-taker in domestic cricket last season, said he was happy with the way he bowled on Wednesday.         
	I am an attacking bowler and dont mind if I am hit for a few cover-driven fours. And thats exactly what happened when I got Badrinath out as the ball swung when he drove, he said indicating why the South captain edged to the slip cordon         
	I am looking forward to play for India again. My six-day stint at Bangalores National Cricket Academy under Dav Whatmore and trainer Paul Chapman had been very beneficial, he added.

                                                   Kumble, Ishant fitness test today
                      
	Ahmedabad: A final call on the availability of Test captain Anil Kumble and young speedster Ishant Sharma for the second Test against South Africa would be taken after their fitness assessment on Wednesday.         
	Both Kumble and Ishant bowled decent spells at the optional nets in Motera and the team management will be anxious to have them fit in the wake of Sachin Tendulkars unavailability owing to a groin injury.         
	Only seven players, including Murali Kartik who is recovering from an ankle injury, came to the optional practice session on Tuesday and the latter was put through his paces mildly by team physiotherapist Paul Close.         
	Kumble, who has a groin niggle sustained in Chennai, and Ishant, recovering from an injured finger and toe  bowled at the nets mostly against Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif who had lengthy stints.         
	Kumble later indicated that he was feeling better, which should bring cheers to the Indian camp. If nets sessions are any indication, Yuvraj is almost a certainty to take Tendulkars place in the middle order after he was asked to bat on three different surfaces by coach Gary Kirsten.         
	In that case, Kaif, who last played a Test for India in June 2006 in Kingston, would have to wait some more time.         
	Other players who attended the nets were allrounder Irfan Pathan and leg-spinner Piyush Chawla, both of whom warmed the benches in the series opener.         
	Kumble was off the ground on the final day of the first Test a little after lunch. He said it was a slight niggle, and that he did not risk aggravating the injury.         
	If Ishants passes the fitness test then theres every chance that he will get a look in. Sreesanth and Rudra Pratap Singh, especially the latter, were hardly impressive at the Chepauk. Kumble though defended RP saying a bowler shouldnt be judged on the basis of one match.

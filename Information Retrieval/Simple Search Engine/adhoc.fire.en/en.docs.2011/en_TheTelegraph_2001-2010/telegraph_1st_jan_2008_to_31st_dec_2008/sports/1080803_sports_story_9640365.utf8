	 Beijing: Jamaican 100 metre world record holder Usain Bolt will run both the 100 and 200 metres at the Beijing Olympics, his coach said on Saturday.         
	Neither the coach Glen Mills nor Bolt had previously confirmed that the Jamaican sprinter would run both the events.         
	He will run both, Mills said.         
	Bolt had always said he wanted to run both sprint races at the Games but the coach had been hesitant to allow the 21-year-old world 200 metres silver medallist to add the 100metres to his Olympic hopes.

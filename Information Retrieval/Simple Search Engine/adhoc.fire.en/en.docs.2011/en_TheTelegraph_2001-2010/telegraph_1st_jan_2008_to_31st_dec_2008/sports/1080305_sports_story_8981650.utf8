                                                   Bengal confident
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Guwahati: Bengal will meet Jharkhand in their final outing of the East Zone National One-dayers to be held at the Nehru Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Though inconsequential for Bengal, who have already qualified for the main round with 15 points from three matches, Jharkhand would look for a win to seal their berth in the knockouts. Jharkhand have nine points from three matches. Sourav Ganguly, who had a disappointing outing against Orissa on Monday, will look for a good knock at his happy hunting ground.

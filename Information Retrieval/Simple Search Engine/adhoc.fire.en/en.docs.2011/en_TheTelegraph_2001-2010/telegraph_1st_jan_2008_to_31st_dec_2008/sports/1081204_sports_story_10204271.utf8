	Calcutta/London: England will fly to Abu Dhabi on Thursday before travelling on to India to resume their tour, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said late on Wednesday.         
	England returned home early from their one-day series in India after the attacks in Mumbai last week and the ECB spent 72 hours evaluating security issues before deciding whether the squad would return for two Test matches.         
	While we have sought to reassure players that their safety is paramount we have not pressurised any player into making the trip against their will, Hugh Morris, the managing director of England Cricket, said in a ECB statement.         
	Englands squad, along with nine members of the England performance squad, will practise in Abu Dhabi before travelling on to India next week, subject to the implementation of security recommendations.         
	Earlier, the ECB security adviser Reg Dickason virtually gave the green signal to Chennai as the venue for the first Test, saying the organisers have addressed all his concerns.         
	After his arrival in Chennai, Dickason met BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan and top cops before inspecting the MA Chidambaram Stadium which is scheduled to host the first Test from December 11.         
	We had some security concerns and those have been addressed, Dickason said.         
	Srinivasan, also the president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, said: As per our discussions, hopefully, Chennai would be hosting the first match.         
	Later in a statement, Srinivasan said: BCCI expects no problem with the first Test being held in Chennai.         
	City police commissioner K. Radhakrishnan said that Dickason was satisfied with the security arrangements being planned for the match. He expressed satisfaction, he said.         
	On the security arrangements being planned for the Test, he revealed: Central access control system will be installed at the vantage points and the players viewing area and also at the team hotel.         
	The players, upon their arrival here, will be advised to restrict their movements outside the hotel area, he said.         
	The Tamil Nadu police will also provide extra security at the stadium, which will be more than the usual security arrangement and the players protection by the security staff will be watertight, Radhakrishnan added.         
	Dickason will proceed to Mohali (venue of the second Test) for discussions with the Punjab Cricket Association, the BCCI statement said.         
	After completing his recce, Dickason will submit a detailed report to the ECB.

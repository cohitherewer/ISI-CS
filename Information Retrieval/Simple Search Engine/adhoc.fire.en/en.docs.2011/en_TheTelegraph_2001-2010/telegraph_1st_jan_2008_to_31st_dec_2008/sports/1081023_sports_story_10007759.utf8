The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shaun Marsh to replace Phil Jaques
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shaun Marsh to replace Phil Jaques
            A STAFF REPORTER            Shaun Marsh                           
	Calcutta: Shaun Marsh will join the Australia squad in India as replacement for injured opening batsman Phil Jaques.         
	The 25-year-old Western Australia opener is yet to play a Test, but averages 47.57 in eight one-dayers. He also impressed for Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League.         
	Jaques was forced to return home to seek specialist advice for a back-related injury. Shaun is the son of former Australia opener and coach Geoff.         
	Shaun has been selected having opened the batting for Australia in the one-day International arena and shown great potential, Cricket Australias National Selection Panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said in a media release on Wednesday.         
	He has recently moved to opening the batting in all three forms of the game in inter-state competition and played very well in Western Australias run chase and victory at the WACA against New South Wales.         
	As a replacement batsman on the tour, should the opportunity arise, we are confident that Shaun could fill any role in the batting order. We have also taken the opportunity to enhance Shauns international experience as we consider him to be one of the promising young batsmen in Australia capable of having a significant impact on Australian cricket in the future, Hilditch added.         
	The third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy begins on Wednesday in Delhi. Australia trail the four-match series 0-1.         
	After the retirement of Test opener Justin Langer, Australia have been looking for a suitable replacement in Jaques. He had opened with seasoned opener Matthew Hayden in Australias home series against India earlier this year.         
	Since he was not too successful, Aussies have turned to Simon Katich, who has been opening the innings with Hayden in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy.         
	Jaques injury has given Marsh a chance to get into the Test squad at least.         
	Australians believe Shaun is a very talented batsman. His performance for Australia in the one-dayers has boosted this belief.         
	Marsh caught the eye during the inaugural IPL in April-May this year. His performance at the top of the Kings XI Punjab batting order impressed everybody.         
	The young opener, who has batting in his genes, did not get a chance to play in the early part of the tournament, but played a crucial role to take his team, led by Yuvraj Singh, to the semi-finals of the tournament.         
	The Australian team arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday for the third Test.

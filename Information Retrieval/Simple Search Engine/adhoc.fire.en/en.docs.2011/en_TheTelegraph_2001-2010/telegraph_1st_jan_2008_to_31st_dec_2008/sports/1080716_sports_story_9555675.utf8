The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chance for Dinesh, Parthiv: Kumble
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chance for Dinesh, Parthiv: Kumble
                      
	Colombo: Test captain Anil Kumble is in no mood to lament cricket-weary Mahendra Singh Dhonis absence from the squad and believes it is a gilt-edged opportunity for Dinesh Karthik and Parthiv Patel to prove their mettle.         
	Addressing a press conference soon after the team landed here for the three-match Test series, Kumble sounded upbeat about the teams prospects.         
	This would give an opportunity to both Dinesh and Parthiv to prove themselves after their good showing in the domestic cricket, Kumble said.         
	Dhoni had earlier cited fatigue and opted out of the Test squad. Kumble refused to delve into the pros and cons of Dhonis decision and said the ODI captain had already explained the reasons behind his decision.         
	Though Kumble oozed confidence that his side would live up to the expectations in the series, the seasoned campaigner admitted it would not be a cakewalk for the visitors.         
	It will be a tough series and will require a lot of hard work, Kumble said.         
	Sri Lanka has an impressive record at home and they have found a new match-winner in spin sensation Ajantha Mendis. Kumble, though, insisted the Indian batsmen were not losing sleep over him.         
	We will be on the lookout, Kumble said, when his opinion was sought on the mystery spinner who ran through the Indian batting order in the Asia Cup final. Kumble felt with pace spearhead Zaheer Khan returning to the side, the Indian attack would have a formidable look.         
	Mahela Jayawardene, too, felt that the series would be hard-fought. According to him, Sachin Tendulkars return to the side would lend much depth to the visiting batting line-up.         
	On the introduction of the referral system, which would allow the sides to challenge umpires decision, Jayawardene said it would be an advantage for the players.           (PTI)

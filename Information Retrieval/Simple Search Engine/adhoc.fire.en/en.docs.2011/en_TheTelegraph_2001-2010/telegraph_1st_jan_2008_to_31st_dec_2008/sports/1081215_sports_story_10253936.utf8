                                                                                                                                                                                           Anand: Titles are only milestones
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                                      
	Chennai: Viswanathan Anand, who turned 39 on Thursday, is using the short break in the circuit to catch up with friends and relatives in his hometown. The world champion spoke to The Telegraph, largely on life beyond chess.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The past few weeks         
	Its been pretty crazy... Back home after winning the World Championship, there were just too many receptions to attend, some of which were wonderful. Then I spent a couple of days at home and was off to Bandhavgarh National Park, the wildlife sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh. We spent five days out there and had a wonderful time. We saw six tigers in all and also enjoyed the elephant rides. Then it was back to Chennai before another short trip to Goa and Mumbai. Since then Ive been at home and will be here for the next few days.         
	On his interests beyond chess         
	I try and keep myself updated with cricket. It was nice to meet (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni the other day and share a few ideas. I have been following the ongoing Test versus England. Besides cricket, I also follow football, Formula One, tennis and Indians achievements in other sports. For example, it was nice to read Saina Nehwal moving into the top 10 in world badminton.         
	His favourites in other sports         
	I am a Real Madrid fan May be staying in Spain has motivated me. Another major reason was because I am a Zinedine Zidane fan. Hes my all-time favourite. I watched quite a few matches at the Bernabeu when he was playing. I follow their progress regularly. They havent been doing well this season but you never knowIve also been following the Champions League, the English Premier League Manchester United and Chelsea are my favourites and its been fun to watch Liverpool this time.         
	In Formula One, I follow Fernando Alonso. I didnt have to do much rooting for him this time though (laughs) It was great to see him win the Singapore GP this year to end his drought I quite liked watching the night race.         
	In tennis, I was a John McEnroe fan in his early days and followed Pete Samprass career closely for a long time. The last few years, it has been Roger Federer though. He didnt do well this year and I would be very curious to see if he can bounce back this year. In fact, Rafael Nadal deserved to be No. 1         
	His biggest moment         
	Every moment is big Winning the last two World Championships was fantastic Being world No. 1. Winning in Linares Theres been lot of good moments and I savour all of them.         
	Any heroes whom he idolised outside chess         
	Like I told you, I liked Zidane a lot. Simply loved watching him his style of play, his ball control, his charisma Ronaldinho at his best is also riveting. Also loved Federer in action, the silken touch and the power I guess I admired certain qualities in all of them.         
	If he believes in God or any other supernatural power         
	I pray I find that comforting.         
	His target         
	I next play in Linares in February. Trying to keep the No.1 spot will be the topmost priority.         
	Most precious prize after winning the World Championship         
	(After thinking for a while) I was very touched by the youngsters  playing in the World Youth Championships in Vietnam then  who send me a huge congratulatory banner the day after I won in Bonn.         
	If, at times, motivation is a problem         
	I dont think that is a problem. When the tournament approaches, the tension is always back. Im motivated to defend my world title and the No.1 ranking Titles are only milestones. Its the love for the game that keeps me going. Motivation is not going to be a problem. Im very high on it.         
	On missing home         
	Ive got used to it now. Splitting time between Chennai and Spain         
	Any superstitions         
	Little and harmless ones I use the lucky pin twice or have breakfast at the same time. Its nothing major and has lessened now.         
	Role of wife Aruna         
	She plays a very important role When we got married she knew very little about chess, but now she plays a big part. I depend heavily on her since she takes care of the non-tournament load. During tournaments, for example, I keep myself detached from the outside world. It is she who helps me stay relaxed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fed up Bartoli needs a break
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fed up Bartoli needs a break
                      
	Paris: French No. 1 Marion Bartoli said she needed a break from tennis after suffering a demoralising first-round exit at the French Open on Wednesday.         
	Im just fed up. Im going to turn off my mobile phone, turn off my TV set, forget about Roland Garros, the ninth-seeded Bartoli told reporters after her 7-6, 3-6, 2-6 defeat at the hands of Australian Casey Dellacqua.         
	Im going to try not to think about it. Go far away, very far away. Why not take a short break, some holidays ?         
	Bartoli, who reached the Wimbledon final last year, said she was too worn out to start her preparation for the grass court Grand Slam that brought her to prominence.         
	Since the beginning of this year Ive been playing and I felt tired and I thought, well, this is probably psychological, but its five months Ive been feeling this, in this state, being very tired, she said.         
	So Ill probably start practising for the season on grass, but I first want to think about myself.         
	Bartoli, who picked up a back injury at the start of the season, snubbed a call-up for a Fed Cup first-round tie against China in February, saying it would be too tiring for her.         
	She also withdrew from the Strasbourg International last week with a wrist injury and was not fully fit for her Roland Garros campaign.         
	It was a problem for me on my forehand. I had to use my wrist more, so I made many unforced errors, especially on the match point or balls I sent in the net directly, she said. So that was a bit of a difficulty for me. However, I think I could have overcome that today.         
	Bartoli was 6-5 up when rain ended play on Tuesday but she could not find her touch on Wednesday, bowing out after two hours and two minutes.           (REUTERS)

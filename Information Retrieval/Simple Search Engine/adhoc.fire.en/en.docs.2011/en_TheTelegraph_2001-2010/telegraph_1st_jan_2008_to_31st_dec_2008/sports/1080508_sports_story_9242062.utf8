            CRICKET BRIEFS                
	 New Delhi: The April 25 slapgate involving Harbhajan Singh and Sreesanth threatened to turn uglier before teammates and security guards separated the volatile cricketers. After the off-spinner slapped Sreesanth, said a television channel on Wednesday, the standoff prolonged for a few minutes which saw Harbhajan nudging and abusing him.         
	According to the channel, which claimed to have had a look at the footage, Harbhajan had another go at Sreesanth after he had slapped him while shaking hands with rival players after the match. Sreesanth, on his part, was not ready to take it lying down and he too lounged at Harbhajan before teammates held him back  
	Bhajji appeal  
	 New Delhi: Faced with the possibility of being banned for a few matches by the BCCI, Harbhajan Singh has appealed to the Board to give him one final chance before taking disciplinary action against him. Harbhajan has written a fresh letter to the BCCI just two days ahead of the hearing.         
	Meanwhile, With video footage failing to provide any clue on what may have provoked Harbhajan Singh into slapping Sreesanth, commissioner Sudhir Nanavati on Wednesday said he may now view the recording of the entire match before the incident to establish the exact chain of events.  
	Younis to join  
	 Karachi: Rajasthan Royals will soon have another potent weapon in their armour when senior Pakistan batsman Younis Khan joins them next week. I will leave on the 14th or 15th and hopefully should play in the final leg. The good thing is that there is no pressure on me as the team has done well so far, Younis said on Wednesday.   
	ACA keen  
	Melbourne: With the collective cost of the IPL franchises predicted to be over five times in next five years, the Australian Cricket Association feels it is important to have a designated slot for the competition to prevent conflict with Test or one-day cricket. ACA chief Paul Marsh said IPL had gripped world cricket and administrators needed to embrace the new product.   
	Sajid claim  
	London: A day after Ravi Bopara said he had rejected an offer to play in the IPL, his England teammate Sajid Mahmood claimed he too turned down an offer to be part of the tournament in order to regain his place in national squad. Ive had offers to join the IPL but Im desperate to work my way back into the England side, 26-year-old Mahmood said.   
	Misbah let off  
	Lahore: After claiming that the Pakistan vice-captain Misbah-ul Haqs association with the liquor baron Vijay Mallya-owned Bangalore Royal Challengers was an unlawful act, the PCB has decided that it will not take any action against him.   
	Nominees  
	 Calcutta: Indias one day captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and two of his predecessors Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid are among the nominees for Castrol Cricketer of the Year award for 2007.

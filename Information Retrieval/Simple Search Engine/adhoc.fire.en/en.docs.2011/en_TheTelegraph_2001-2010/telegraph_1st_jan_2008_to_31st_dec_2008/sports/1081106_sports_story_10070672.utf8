	New Delhi: Mohammed Yousuf expectedly joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL) on Wednesday, saying it was sheer misunderstanding that kept him away from the rebel league for the past one year. Yousuf will play for the Lahore Badshahs.         
	Yousuf, who had signed to play in the ICL last year, decided to reject the agreement after he received an offer from the Indian Premier League (IPL). The ICL authorities had then moved to court against the Pakistani player.

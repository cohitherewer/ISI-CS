                                                   IPL tickets issue
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) members will have to buy tickets to watch the Indian Premier League matches at the Eden.         
	CAB president Prasun Mukherjee said on Saturday that there would be no complimentary passes and ticket sales might get underway from April 1.         
	He also hinted that the association would have to remain content with the 20 per cent quota of tickets in each block.         
	People buying seasonal tickets will get a discount and have to pay Rs 1050 instead of Rs 1200, Rs 1750 instead of Rs 2100 and Rs 3500 for Rs 4200 in three categories of tickets.         
	Meanwhile, Mumbai home matches will not be held at the CCI, because no agreement has been reached on tickets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hamilton proud of mature display
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hamilton proud of mature display

	Eight weeks have passed since Lewis Hamilton occupied the top step of a Formula One podium, but he has scored at least one moral victory in the interim  in Belgium, a race he might yet reclaim if next Mondays appeal annuls the 25-second penalty that pushed him down to third place  and believes his seventh place in Italy on Sunday underlined a different side to his character.         
	Mired in the lower midfield, the consequence of an optimistic tyre choice when he allowed his confidence to overrule common sense during qualifying, Hamilton resisted the temptation to atone too swiftly for his error.         
	With visibility compromised by a dense wall of spray and pools of standing water on the track, he adopted a patient approach and waited for conditions to stabilise. He gained a couple of places during the first 10 laps and overtook Kimi Raikkonen on the 11th. He then left the world champion trailing as he embarked upon a feast of overtaking, physically passing six more cars  and benefiting from three drivers early fuel stops  to move up to second place by lap 24.         
	I showed maturity, he said, and proved I am a fighting force as well. I went forwards and no one overtook me, which is always a nice feeling after a race.         
	McLaren erred on the side of caution when he pitted on lap 27, sticking with extreme wet tyres rather than fitting more aggressive intermediates.         
	Had the team repeated the gamble that proved so costly the previous day, he would have been spared a second stop. A podium finish would have been assured and he might well have won, although he regarded seventh place, which kept him one point ahead in the title race, as useful damage limitation.         
	It could have been a lot worse, he said. We might have come away with no points and second place in the championship. To see only a few people in front of me wasnt so bad, and I feel positive.         
	Hamilton believes lessons learnt last year, when he came within a point of becoming F1s first rookie champion, will stand him in good stead during the final four races of the campaign.         
	Im not really thinking about our Belgian appeal, he said. I feel like I won that race, but whats happened has happened. Ill move on whatever the result and concentrate on getting more points in the next few races.         
	Im focusing on staying in shape and not letting anything distract me. Im not messing around doing stupid things  Im keeping myself nice and quiet and doing everything right.         
	Hamilton has always raced with his heart, but Monza proved his head can be just as influential.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Birmingham: Graeme Smith plundered a fighting 154 not out to lead his South Africa team to a five-wicket victory over England that clinched the Test series at Edgbaston on Saturday.         
	South Africa, set 281 to win the third Test and with it the four-match series after they went 1-0 up at Headingley, reached 283 for five in fading light on day four after the pendulum had swung both ways.         
	Mark Boucher hit 45 in a crucial stand of 112 with his skipper. The Proteas claimed their first series win in England since 1965, though they did not play international cricket from 1970 to 1991 because of the countrys isolation. They surrendered series leads in 1994, 1998 and 2003.         
	England had gone six years without losing a Test series at home until India won in 2007 and now they have lost their second at home.         
	Captain Smith was doubtful coming in to the match because of a back injury but elected to play with pain-killing tablets to ease his discomfort. His 16th Test century, scored in 246 balls, and fourth against England steered his team home.         
	South Africa started brightly when reaching 65 for no loss but they slumped to 93 for four. AB de Villiers stand of 78 with Smith settled his teams nerves as they closed on their target. He was eventually caught at slip off spinner Monty Panesar for 27.         
	Smith batted fluently throughout, though he did enjoy moments of fortune. When on 74, he played no stroke to a ball from Panesar that turned square and would have hit middle stump but umpire Aleem Dar saved him.         
	On 79 he should have been run out when Ian Bell, standing over the wickets, failed to catch a throw bounced in from wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose. Smith was yards short.         
	His luck continued when on 85. Replays suggested he got a deflection off his glove from Panesar to Ambrose, but half-hearted appeals from England failed to convince Dar to send him to the pavilion.         
	On the next ball, Smith swept towards the midwicket boundary where James Anderson was fielding, but the ball reached him on the first bounce.           (REUTERS)

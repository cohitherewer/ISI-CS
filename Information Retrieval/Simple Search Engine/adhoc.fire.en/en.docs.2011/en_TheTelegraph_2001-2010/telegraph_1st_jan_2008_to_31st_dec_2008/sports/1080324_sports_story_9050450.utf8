  - Manchester United steamroll Liverpool 3-0, take five-point lead             Didier Drogba celebrates after scoring his second and Chelseas winning goal against Arsenal during their Premier League match at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. (AFP)                           
	London: Manchester United increased their lead in the Premier League to five points on Sunday, and Chelsea emerged as the defending champions main rival in this seasons title chase.         
	United beat Liverpool 3-0 to improve to 73 points, while Chelsea took over second place with 68 points by rallying to beat Arsenal 2-1. The Gunners are third with 67 points, and Liverpool are fourth with 59.         
	Its going to go right to the end, said Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, whose team host Arsenal on April 13 and play at Chelsea on April 26.         
	Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 34th goal of the season, and Wes Brown and Nani added the others for United at Old Trafford.         
	Liverpool played the entire second half with 10 men because Javier Mascherano was sent off after getting a second yellow card.         
	Didier Drogba scored for Chelsea in the 73rd and 82nd minutes. Bacary Sagna had given Arsenal the lead with his first goal for the team in the 59th.         
	Brown, who had previously scored only two goals in 10 years for his hometown club, headed in a Wayne Rooney cross 11 minutes before halftime.         
	Ten minutes later, Liverpool were reduced to 10 men when midfielder Mascherano, who had been booked early on for a late tackle, was cautioned for the second time by referee Steve Bennett.         
	The decision prompted a furious response from the Argentina international who had to be dragged away from the official by several of his teammates.         
	Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez was also incensed by the decision after Mascherano responded to a booking for Fernando Torres, who could have been sent off himself in the second half as he allowed his frustration to show.         
	The incident summed up an unhappy afternoon for Liverpool, who have not beaten United since April 2004 and have now failed to score in their last seven league games against Fergusons side.         
	The Merseyside club came into the game in decent form, having won their seven previous matches, but their key players, Torres and Steven Gerrard, made little impact.         
	Ronaldo, the leagues leading scorer, also looked subdued for long periods but still managed to score his 24th Premier League goal of the season as United could have won by a bigger margin.         
	Only a superb performance from Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina, who was nevertheless at fault with Browns goal, spared Liverpool from total humiliation, the Spain international single-handedly keeping United out until the closing stages.         
	Chelsea kept alive their hopes of winning the Premier League title at the same time as severely denting Arsenals.         
	After leading the table at the start of the month, Arsenal Wenger-guided sides hopes of their first title since 2004 are fading fast with only seven matches to play.         
	The Chelsea fans, who last saw their team lose at home in the league 78 matches ago when Arsenal won at Stamford Bridge in February 2004, were fearing the worst as the match moved into its closing stages with Arsenal leading by Sagnas first goal for the club.         
	Both teams had played some superb football throughout the game, but Arsenal had just shaded the midfield with Alexandr Hleb having an outstanding game and Robin van Persie a continual threat in only his second start after a long injury lay-off.         
	And with almost an hour played, Arsenal took the lead they just about deserved. Sagna escaped his markers to head Fabregass corner inside Carlo Cudicinis near post.         
	Chelsea though, who lost the lead three times in Wednesdays remarkable 4-4 draw against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, this time found the strength to pull themselves back into the game and they equalised with 17 minutes to go.         
	Arsenal failed to clear a long ball from John Terry which ran loose to Drogba who thundered the ball past the previously unbeatable Manuel Almunia for the equaliser.         
	Some wayward defending cost Arsenal the game soon after when Kolo Toure failed to cut out Joe Coles cross and Drogba pounced to score.           (REUTERS)

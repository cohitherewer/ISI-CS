The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan take on Sporting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bagan take on Sporting
                      
	Panaji: Injury-hit Mohun Bagan, who had a disappointing start to the ONGC I-league, will have to pull up their socks when they meet confident Sporting Clube de Goa in the third round at the Nehru stadium here on Saturday.         
	Sporting Clube de Goa are on a high after two successive wins over Vasco and Mohammedan Sporting and are looking to keep their momentum going.         
	The Sporting midfield, consisting of Harmanjot Khabra, Micky Fernandes, Wilton Gomes and Joseph Pereira, have combined well.         
	On the other hand, Mohun Bagan are struggling to strike the right chord following their defeat to Mumbai FC and a draw against Air India. (PTI)

	Aberdeen (Scotland): New Zealand followed up their one-day series win over England with a record-breaking defeat of Ireland here on Tuesday in the opening match of a triangular tournament also involving Scotland.         
	The Black Caps thrashed a makeshift Irish side by 290 runs on Tuesday in what was the biggest margin of victory in the history of one-day International cricket, surpassing Indias 257-run defeat of Bermuda at last years World Cup.         
	New Zealands total of 402 for two was also their highest one-day International total and an opening stand of 274 runs between Brendon McCullum and James Marshall was the fifth highest for any wicket. In reply, Ireland were skittled out for 112.         
	McCullum claimed his first ODI century with a knock of 166 from 141 deliveries that featured 11 boundaries and 10 sixes. Marshall took 120 balls to post his hundred but then added a further 61 from only 21 more deliveries.         
	McCullum finally fell in the 43rd over, holing out to Ryan Haire.           (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ivanovic wins despite injury
                                                   Ivanovic wins despite injury
                            
	Doha: Top seed Ana Ivanovic may be forced to withdraw from the Qatar Open after suffering an ankle injury on her way to the third round on Wednesday.         
	The Serbian, who reached last months Australian Open final, was just two points from victory against Olga Govortsova of Belarus when she slipped on the baseline and collapsed in agony.         
	Ivanovic was able to continue after her left ankle was taped and, from 30-30, she held off a game point and won the last three points to claim a 6-3, 6-1 second round victory.         
	But after the match she was clearly in pain, was unable to walk properly and was doubtful she would be able to play her next match against Polands Agnieszka Radwanska.         
	It definitely hurts a lot and I have difficulty to step on it, Ivanovic said.         
	They think it might be a strain. I have to wait and see how it reacts overnight. But honestly its very questionable. But Ill try to recover as best I can and see if I can go on court.

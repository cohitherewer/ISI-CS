The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brilliance is Lewis only crime
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Brilliance is Lewis only crime
            Kevin Garside            Lewis Hamilton                           
	The youngest world champion in Formula One; younger than Michael Schumacher, younger than Ayrton Senna, younger than Alain Prost, younger than Sir Jackie Stewart, younger than any of the greats that have gone before. That is the remarkable appellation awaiting Lewis Hamilton in Brazil next Sunday.         
	A top-five finish guarantees Hamilton his place in history. His seven-point lead in the drivers championship will be sufficient should Felipe Massa, the only man who can deny Hamilton, finish outside the top two.         
	So what are we to make of Hamilton? Where does he stand in the sporting scheme of things? What kind of a person is he?         
	In recent weeks Hamilton has been under the profiling microscope, and has emerged as a divisive figure, demonised by some. The court of paddock opinion has had him at varying points arrogant, selfish, egotistical, reckless, spoilt and vulnerable under pressure. Flavio Briatore infamously labelled him no Muhammad Ali.         
	Some respectfully disagree. Heres why.         
	TALENT         
	Hamiltons crime was to enter F1 with the equivalent of F. E. C.  Future England Captain  etched on his McLaren. A nine-year association with the team led to a race drive in 2007. This gave the impression that Hamilton was spoon-fed. This ignores the five years Hamilton spent in karts assembled and held together by his father. McLaren did not step in until Hamilton was 13 years old and already a karting champion.         
	CHARACTER         
	Hamiltons crime was to run into a charismatic double world champion and refuse to be intimidated. Fernando Alonso, for a week at least still the youngest champion in F1, is an amazing talent. Hamilton acknowledged that in every respect, bar one. He never deferred on the track. Alonso could not believe that McLaren did not make it plain to Hamilton that his role was to support the double world champion. That is why he left Renault. It was a matter of respect. Hamilton did not see it that way. Neither did McLaren. He burst off the line to post nine successive podiums, a record for a rookie, which catapulted him into an early championship lead.         
	EGO         
	Hamiltons crime is to be different, unique even in F1. How many black faces do you see in the paddock other than his? This has created huge interest in him and the sport. There is resentment in the paddock. His rivals display classic symptoms of jealousy. They infer behavioural characteristics that simply are not there. On the circuit he is a brute.         
	They all are. Drivers, like all top athletes, are driven by an almost pathological need to succeed. Hamilton is no different.         
	There is no self-doubt. Confidence is absolute. Critics interpret this as arrogance. It is not. It is legitimate competitive edge. Out of the car he is grounded, courteous and polite. He comes from an ordinary family. His values are yours and mine. He is not a son of privilege. His family made every possible sacrifice to further his career. He is proof of what can be achieved through hard graft, dedication and commitment.

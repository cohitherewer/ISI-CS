                                                     Im good enough to win French: Federer
                  Roger Federer                     
	St Petersburg: Roger Federer has scoffed at suggestions that he is destined never to win the French Open despite having fallen at the last hurdle in the past two years.         
	The 26-year-old Swiss star lost to clay court king Rafael Nadal in both the 2006 and 2007 finals and the Roland Garros title remains the only one missing from his career Grand Slam set.         
	The French Open obviously is one of the big goals for me, he said here on Monday after being named as Laureus world sportsman of the year for a record fourth straight time.         
	I hope its not the one that is going to elude me. I am still young, I still have time on my side. Ive heard some people say that its possibly my last chance this year. I disagree because I think great athletes can win Grand Slams all the way through to the last days of their tennis careers. I am going to try like hell to win.         
	I dont think I need luck. I am good enough on clay. I grew up on clay and its something that comes very naturally to me. Maybe I just need a favourable draw sometimes Maybe I just need that one set, that one match that is going to make me win the tournament because twice I was just two sets away from winning the tournament.

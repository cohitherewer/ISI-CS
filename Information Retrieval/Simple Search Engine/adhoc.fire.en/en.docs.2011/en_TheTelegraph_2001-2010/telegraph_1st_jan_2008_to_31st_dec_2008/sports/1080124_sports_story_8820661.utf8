                                                     Mental approach will make the biggest difference: Buchanan

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 - 
 Australias highly successful former coach looks back and ahead 
   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
        John Buchanan
   
	Adelaide: John Buchanan enjoyed a fantastic success rate (69 Test wins as opposed to 10 losses and 160 ODI victories as opposed to 46 defeats) during his seven-and-a-half years as Australias coach, starting late 1999. Many, in fact, give him complete credit for getting the Ricky Pontings to constantly raise the bar.
 
	Buchanan, who is Brisbane-based, made a brief visit to Adelaide and spoke to The Telegraph on Wednesday afternoon. 
 
	The following are excerpts:
 
	On his thoughts on the eve of the ongoing series final Test
 
	I expect a very closely fought match... My belief is that the mental approach will make the biggest difference... India have the confidence of having won in Perth, but the ODI team thing is flying around... Much will depend on how the affected individuals handle the situation... I expect Australia to come out strongly, now that the distraction of chasing a world record (17th consecutive Test win) isnt there.
 
	On Indias ODI squad, which is sans the Sourav Gangulys
 
	I realise that some of the senior batters arent there, but I wouldnt like to comment... I suppose your selectors have kept one eye on the next (2011) World Cup.
 
	On the distraction bit in Perth
 
	I do believe the guys were distracted by being just one Test away from a world record... Eventually, it never happened... The other distraction was what happened in Sydney... Coming to the final Test, Im sure Ricky wont accept being second best either from himself or any teammate. 
 
	On what can make the biggest difference for Australia
 
	Matthew Haydens return, after missing the Perth Test... With him back in the XI, Australias top three can really dominate... Much depends on (Virender) Sehwag, yes, but I dont think Indias top three can dominate in Australias manner.
 
	On what can make the biggest difference for India
 
	(Smiles) Well, not allowing Australia to dominate from the start... The Indians will themselves be looking to have a strong foundation and to then build on that. 
 
	On his thoughts on what happened in Sydney
 
	I think far too much has already been said... Both teams had something to do with some of what went on... Its sad that the focus just shifted from 98 per cent of the cricket which was played in good spirit and was high on quality... I hope the ICC takes lessons from that... Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson didnt appoint themselves, they were appointed by the ICC which believed they were the best for the Test... Over the five days, though, they didnt convince me and the rest that they indeed were the best... The ICC has to look into the whole business of training umpires.
 
	On the Australians having been troubled by the reverse swing during the 2005 Ashes in England and being troubled by the conventional swing in the ongoing series
 
	Swing troubles teams all over the world... Actually, there are not many who swing the ball, but the Indians certainly have a few who can do so... In England, the batters realised what the problem was and sat down to find a solution... Ill be very surprised if, over the past few days, the batters as a unit havent done the same again. 
 
	On Anil Kumble as captain
 
	Hes been outstanding and its not a coincidence that India beat Pakistan in the recent Test series and have been so competitive in Australia... Ive always seen Kumble as a natural leader, somebody who stood out... Hes very thoughtful, is respected by teammates and the opposition and, really, the captaincy was long overdue.
 
	On whether Ponting has improved as captain
 
	Hes certainly taken on a bigger leadership role in the last couple of years... He believes he can improve and all the signs are that hes maturing as captain...
 
	On Ian Chappells belief that Ponting is a better captain than Steve Waugh
 
	One must realise that the captains are influenced by the ones theyve themselves played under and by the situation when theyve got the captaincy... Steve played under Allan Border and Mark Taylor and, for much of that period, Bobby Simpson was the coach... Simpson injected discipline and steel and he wanted control... I took over (from Geoff Marsh) and tried to do things differently... Steve, who was then the captain, didnt have many senior players in the team... With Ponting, it has been different... He needed to give the seniors space and allow them to make their own call... Teams evolve... Steve was and Ricky is outstanding.
 
	On his successor, Tim Nielsen
 
	Hes very talented and relates well to the players. Hes been a very good choice.
 
	On whether hes missed coaching Australia
 
	Ive missed being around people... Missed the players, the support staff... There are relationships which you dont forget, but Id decided in October 2005 itself that Id leave after the 2007 World Cup... Fortunately, I went out on a high. 
 
	On whether, after a couple of years, he could return as coach of a national team
 
	Doesnt look like at this point in time, but who knows? (After a pause) The IPL, for example, is an interesting development and Im keeping my eyes and ears open.
 
	On what keeps him busy
 
	Well, instead of working with cricket teams Im working with corporate teams! The principles of coaching are being applied to business and I quite enjoy working out of Brisbane.
 
	On whether his work will take him to India too
 
	I hope it does.
 
	On what makes a successful team
 
	(Laughs) Quality players, a very clear vision of what the future might be and having men whore never satisfied with what theyve achieved.
 
	Finally, on Ian Chappell and Shane Warne questioning his coaching abilities
 
	I dont need to respond to them... Its not necessary... Everybody has made a contribution to Australian cricket and that includes me.

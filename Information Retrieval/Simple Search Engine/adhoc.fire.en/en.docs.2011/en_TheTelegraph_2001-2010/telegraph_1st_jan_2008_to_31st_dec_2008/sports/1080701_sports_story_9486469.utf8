	Calcutta: The CAB is all set to sign former India opener Woorkeri Raman as Bengals coach for the next season.         
	According to president Prasun Mukherjee, Raman will reach the city on Wednesday to have a final discussion before signing the contract.         
	We have spoken to four people but he (Raman) is our first choice. He will be coming to meet us on Wednesday. He seems keen to take up the job, Mukherjee said.         
	It was learnt that Ramans contract will be for one year, and his extension will depend on the performance.

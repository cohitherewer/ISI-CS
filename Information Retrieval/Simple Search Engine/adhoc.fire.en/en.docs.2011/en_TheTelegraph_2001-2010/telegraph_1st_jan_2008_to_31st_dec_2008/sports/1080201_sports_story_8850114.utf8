                                                   CA to monitor Symonds

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: The heat is on Andrew Symonds. The allrounder will have his on-field behaviour scrutinised by Cricket Australia (CA). 
    
	Blamed by Appeals Commissioner John Hansen for initiating the spat with Harbhajan Singh that almost saw India abandon their tour, Symonds is set to meet CA boss James Sutherland to explain his actions, according to a report on Thursday in Australias The Daily Telegraph. 
    
	Sutherland confirmed that his discussion with Symonds would be on the allrounders on-field behaviour. 
    
	Absolutely We will take the opportunity to talk at the right time to Andrew and other players and the players as a group about some of the circumstances and some of the things that are reported in the judgement, he said. But in a bid to soften any public backlash, CA on Wednesday made a point of handing out copies of the players spirit of cricket pact. 
    
	Symonds is a brilliant cricketer. He is tough, uncompromising in terms of the way he plays the game, Sutherland said. He plays the game like most Australians are brought up to play. (But) no doubt with Andrew  as with many other people  there are some things for him to reflect on. 
    
	Sutherland also expressed disappointment that Harbhajan didnt get a more severe punishment, adds an agency report. 
    
	 Judge Hansen says the penalty would have been different if he had had facts in front of him, Sutherland said. 
    
	From that point of view, thats disappointing Im disappointed, CA is disappointed, it sounds like the judge is disappointed too.

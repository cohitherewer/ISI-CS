	Nagpur: V.V.S. Laxman missed out on a century in his 100th Test, but Sachin Tendulkar presented his teammate with his 40th on Day I of final Test on Thursday.         
	Tendulkar, continuing his rich form, hit a fluent 109 that capped another fine batting performance in the series by the Indians. At stumps, the hosts were 311 for five with Sourav Ganguly, playing his last Test, batting on 27 accompanied by captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on four. It was the Mumbai batsmans first hundred in the series and 10th in 29 matches against the world champions.         
	Laxman looked set for a century until he tried to square cut too fine and was caught behind for 64. But the dismissal of these two batsmen, who put on 146 for the fourth wicket, acted as a dampener at the end of the day.         
	Till Laxman made the error, the Australians were for most part of the day left wondering as to whether Ricky Ponting had gone Krazy?         
	Pontings decision to hand a rookie off-spinner his maiden baggy green at the expense of their most economical bowler in the series so far, Stuart Clark, will remain a talking point long after the end of the match, irrespective of the outcome.         
	The visiting captain displayed his gamblers instinct by including the 25-year-old Jason Krejza in place of Clark, who has the best economy rate of 2.20 after sending down 73 overs in the series.         
	Obviously Ponting was relying on the virgin track at the new Jamtha Stadium to crumble fast. To some extent, he might have also been influenced by the fact that his fast bowlers had not managed to get the reverse swing going like the Indians in the previous three Tests.         
	Pontings instinct was almost justified with Krejza, after conceding 32 runs in his first three overs, returning the days best figures of 28-1-138-3.         
	And if Tendulkars two dropped catches  on 85 and 96  were to be counted, Krejza would be having a fiver to his name now and India in a spot of bother. So, as of now, the teams have shared the honours after the first day, which Ponting wouldnt mind especially after losing the toss for the third time in a row.         
	Virender Sehwag set the ball rolling with a typically aggressive 66. With debutant Murali Vijay Krishna providing good support with a confident knock of 33, Sehwag was able to take on the Australian pacers with characteristic disdain.         
	The Nawab of Najafgarh was ruthless in his attack on Krejza from the outset, but the bowler weathered the storm by claiming two wickets in a space of 12 balls.         
	Krejza had Rahul Dravid for his first Test scalp, caught at short leg for a two-ball duck, before Sehwag played him on to his stumps.         
	It was then left to Tendulkar and Laxman to keep India from sliding further, and the two did that in style, piercing the field frequently with delectable shots on both sides of the wicket.         
	Tendulkar had missed out on a hundred in Mohali, where he became Test crickets leading run-scorer during an innings of 88. But in Nagpur, Lady Luck was firmly on his side. Batting on 74, he was stranded in the middle of the wicket after a mix up with Laxman but Krejzas throw missed the stumps at the non-strikers end.         
	Then, trying to take on Krejza, the Mumbaikar top-edged a lofted drive on 85 but Mitchell Johnson failed to hold on at long off. There was similar luck for him on 96, same bowler, identical shot and the same area, only the fielder was Brett Lee.         
	No wonder then that Tendulkar looked up at the sky, which he usually does, and voiced his thanks to the heavens after crossing the milestone. Ultimately, Johnson ended his knock in the second over with the second new ball, with a peach of a delivery that caught his front foot on the crease.

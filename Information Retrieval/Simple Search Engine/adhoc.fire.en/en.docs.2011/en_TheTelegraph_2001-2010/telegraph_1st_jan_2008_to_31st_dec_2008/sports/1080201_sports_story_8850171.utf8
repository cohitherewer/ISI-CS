      A CORRESPONDENT
      Mahendra Singh Dhoni 
             
	Melbourne: Team Indias ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was his usual candid self during the press conference on the eve of the Twenty20 tie against Australia. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
        
	On if matters of the past week will affect his team 
    
	No I really dont care what has been happening in the last week. That is past and I have left it behind and we believe in playing some good cricket here on. 
    
	On what if the crowd tomorrow (90,000 expected) might be hostile to India 
    
	As long as the people on the field are not hostile it doesnt matter. I dont have any problems with that then. 
    
	On if cricket will be quiet or will the banter go on 
    
	Whats cricket without chirping! Why not, I have always believed that little chit-chat has to go on, whether its with the opposition or with your own players theres nothing wrong in having a little talk during the game. 
    
	On if the new bunch has got enough practice 
    
	It would have been great if the boys had some more practice before the one-dayers. They just had a training session yesterday but the wicket wasnt great. Today they had some hits in the indoors, since its raining. But we are looking to use this Twenty20 match as a practice game to get our act together. 
    
	On if he will have an agreement with Ricky Ponting like Anil Kumble did on referrals 
    
	Even that agreement was changed midway, so the mind changes as the play progresses. I am of the view that its best referred to the third umpire and accept whatever he decides and go on . 
    
	On whether Harbhajan Singh will be advised on his conduct or he will be under pressure to control him 
    
	Every individual is on his own I dont think its the skippers job to control a players behaviour. Its the responsibility of every individual to understand how he wants to behave and I am quite sure that Harbhajan is a very sensible and senior guy and he knows what is expected of him. 
    
	On Yuvraj Singhs absence 
    
	Hes a master player in the Twenty20 version, hes proved it for us in South Africa and even in the other games with his fielding and other qualities. Its a step back for us that he will not be playing tomorrow, but at the same time it gives an opportunity for the next guy to come in and do well. 
    
	On the absence of any big names in the team 
    
	I think one-day cricket or Twenty20 is not about big names but about an individual who has a big game on that particular day.

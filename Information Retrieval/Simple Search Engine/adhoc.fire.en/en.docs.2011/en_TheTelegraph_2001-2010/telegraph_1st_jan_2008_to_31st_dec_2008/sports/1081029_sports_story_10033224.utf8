The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo can only get better: Ferguson
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ronaldo can only get better: Ferguson
    - World Footballer of the Year in line for two more awards           Mark Ogden            Cristiano Ronaldo                                 
	Cristiano Ronaldo has been told he can still improve as a footballer after claiming the first of a possible hattrick of personal awards by being named the FifPro World Footballer of the Year.         
	The Manchester United winger, also nominated for the European Footballer of the Year and Fifa World Footballer of the Year awards, has been voted 2008s best player by his fellow professionals across the globe for the FifPro award.         
	And having already been awarded the Football Writers and PFA Player of the Year awards at the end of last season, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson insists that the recognition of Ronaldos talents is thoroughly deserved.         
	Ferguson said: Its fantastic. It is a measure of the quality of the players involved and the success we had last season that Cristiano is quite rightly recognised in a big way.         
	Its well deserved. For a winger to score 42 goals in a season deserves recognition in itself. He is absolutely exciting and is a player who always wants to take the ball. He has great courage as well.         
	Ronaldos recent form for United since returning from an ankle injury last month has been patchy, but Ferguson is confident that the Portuguese star will continue to improve at Old Trafford.         
	He said: What will improve is his authority and his timing because thats what experience gives you. He will get better with his decision making and be able to handle all sorts of situations. At 23, we expect that to progress in the right way.         
	Having fuelled summer-long speculation over his future at United by openly seeking a move to Real Madrid, Ronaldo has yet to confirm his long-term commitment, having issued conflicting statements in recent weeks as to his intentions.         
	But he claims that the main reason behind his decision to stay at United, seemingly discounting the clubs consistent refusal to sell him, was the influence of manager Ferguson.         
	Ronaldo said: Sir Alex was the main factor for keeping me here, but what happened in the summer is finished. My head is focused on the club and playing well for United. Sir Alex has been the big inspiration to me. I am here because of him.         
	Ive been here for five years. Ive learned many things from him and Im continuing to learn. He is a great manager. He has won everything.         
	The Portuguese player is not resting on his laurels as he seeks to recapture the form of last season: I am an ambitious player. I try to improve every season. I know last year was magnificent. I played really well, I scored so many goals and we won major trophies.         
	It is possible this season. But my priority is not only to score goals. I dont have to do that. I just have to play well for the team.         
	Meanwhile, Wayne Rooney has been told he will escape FA punishment after provoking an angry response from Everton supporters at Goodison Park on Saturday by kissing the badge on his United shirt.

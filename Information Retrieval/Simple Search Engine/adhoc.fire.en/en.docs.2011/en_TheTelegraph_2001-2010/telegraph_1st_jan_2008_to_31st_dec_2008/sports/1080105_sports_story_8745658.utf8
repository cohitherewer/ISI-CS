The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal to go all out vs Sporting
                                                East Bengal to go all out vs Sporting
                      
	Margao: East Bengal will be going all out to collect full points when they take on Sporting Clube de Goa in an I-League match at the Nehru Stadium in Margao on Saturday.         
	East Bengal, who are languishing at the bottom half of the table have seven points from eight matches. While Sporting Clube de Goa are one point behind them.         
	East Bengal, who have put up a disappointing show so far after their three consecutive defeats, are looking to begin the new year with a win against Sporting.         
	East Bengal defence which has been their main concern will be looking to their new recruit Julius Chino from Kenya to give more solidarity in the defence. While Alvito DCunha who did not play last match due to double booking will add more strength in the midfield.         
	East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya said his team was struggling to find form but wanted to end the first leg on a winning note to boost our morale before we go into the second leg.         
	Dempo, meanwhile, kept their unbeaten run intact at the end of the first leg when they thrashed Viva Kerala 4-0 in Margao on Friday.         
	Dempo, who led 1-0 at halftime, scored through Valeriano Rebello (34th), Ranti Martins (61st), substitute Clifton Gonsalves (63rd) and Roberto Silva (71st).         
	Dempo finished their first leg and are at the top of the table with 21 points from nine matches. Viva Kerala remained on seven points from as many matches. (PTI)

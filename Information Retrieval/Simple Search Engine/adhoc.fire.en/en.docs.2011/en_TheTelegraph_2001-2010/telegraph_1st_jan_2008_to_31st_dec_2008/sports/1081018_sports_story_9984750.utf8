	Madrid: Croat Ivo Karlovic toppled third seed Novak Djokovic 7-6, 7-6 to make the quarter finals of the Madrid Masters on Thursday.         
	The 14th seed will meet Frenchman Gilles Simon next after unsettling Djokovic with his booming serves.         
	Both sets went to tie-breaks who blasted 20 aces, to Djokovics eight.         
	Earlier, world No. 1 Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Andy Murray all made it to the last eight, but defending champion David Nalbandian went out.         
	Federer comfortably beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-4, 6-1, taking the first when Tsonga double-faulted on his serve.         
	In the only quarter final contest featuring two seeds, he will face Argentinas Juan Martin del Potro. The ninth seed beat compatriot and seventh seed Nalbandian 6-4, 6-2 in just 85 minutes.         
	Top seed Nadal booked his place by breezing past an out-of-sorts Richard Gasquet 6-4, 6-2.         
	Next for up for Nadal is compatriot Feliciano Lopez, who saw off Switzerlands Stanislas Wawrinka 6-4, 6-4.         
	Fourth seed Murray was forced to work for it against big-serving Croatian Marin Cilic 7-5, 7-6.         
	He faces Frances Gael Monfils who put out the eighth seed Andy Roddick 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.         
	In doubles action, Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy made a shock exit, losing their second round match to wildcards Pablo Andujar and Marcel Granollers here.         
	The third-seeded Indo-Czech pair managed to shrug off a disastrous start but eventually lost 1-6, 6-3, 7-10 to their Spanish opponents after a 55-minute battle.         
	The Indian challenge in the event remains in the form of Mahesh Bhupathi, who along with his partner Mark Knowles has reached the quarter finals.           (AGENCIES)

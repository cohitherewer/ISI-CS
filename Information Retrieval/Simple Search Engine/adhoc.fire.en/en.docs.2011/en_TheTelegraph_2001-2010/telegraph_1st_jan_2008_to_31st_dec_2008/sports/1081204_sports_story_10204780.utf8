                                                    Pak board not to punish Asif   Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided not to take any disciplinary action against troubled pacer Mohammed Asif, even if he is penalised by the drugs inquiry tribunal of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for his alleged doping offence in the inaugural edition of the Twenty20meet.  ldquo;It is like double jeopardy. You can rsquo;t punish a man twice for the same crime. If the IPL tribunal does not clear him from the doping offence obviously he is going to face a long ban and the PCB does not come into the picture, rdquo; a senior PCB official said. It was learnt that the PCB had rejected Asif rsquo;s plea for the release of his central contract payments this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Discontent over   CAB teams
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Discontent over   CAB teams
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The composition of the three teams (Bengal Red, Bengal Blue and Bengal White) for the CABs S.K. Acharya Challenger series has led to discontent among the clubs. So much so that a few of the officials have decided to voice their grievance to president Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	The Bengal Red team lead by Laxmi Ratan Shukla consists mainly of Kalighat players while Manoj Tiwarys Bengal White side is loaded heavily with players from Mohun Bagan. The club officials feel sides should have been more evenly balanced. State chief selector Sambaran Banerjee however brushed aside such allegations.         
	We have tried to evenly balance the composition of the three sides. If one team has too many players from a particular club, its just a coincidence. There is no motive behind this, Sambaran said.         
	He added that he was open to ideas and if needed the composition can be changed.

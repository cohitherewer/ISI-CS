            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            South Africa captain Graeme Smith during practice in Chennia on Sunday. (Reuters)                           
	Chennai: Mickey Arthur and Co. neednt have worried.         
	Indeed, Paddy Upton, Team Indias mental conditioning coach, is absolutely clear about not passing on sensitive information.         
	Look, after two years, I may not be with the Indian team... But that doesnt mean Ill pass on confidential details to the next team I may work with... Thats not done, he told The Telegraph.         
	The South Africans had been worried that Upton, who has worked with a number of players in the visiting squad, could pass on information which would compromise the Graeme Smiths.         
	Hand-picked by coach Gary Kirsten, Upton is on a two-year contract.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kovalainens maiden win
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kovalainens maiden win
                                
	Budapest: McLarens Heikki Kovalainen celebrated a shock maiden win at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday after Ferraris Felipe Massa suffered an engine failure, while leading with three laps remaining.         
	Kovalainen capitalised on Massas misfortune to finish ahead of podium debutant Toyotas Timo Glock of Germany with Massas teammate Kimi Raikkonen third.         
	McLarens Lewis Hamilton stayed at the top of the championship standings despite a puncture just after the midway stage, that saw him finish the race in fifth place behind Renault driver and former teammate Fernando Alonso of Spain.         
	Briton Hamilton now holds a five-point lead over Raikkonen in the championship with Massa dropping into third place, a further three points back.         
	Of course, I feel a bit sorry for Felipe because of what happened to him has happened to me a few times this year, said Kovalainen.         
	But Im very happy today, of course, after working through all the hard times along with my team. Massa and Lewis were very fast today but, halfway through, things were working better for me.         
	Massa had looked set to regain the world championship lead after making a stunning start to Sundays race.         
	From third on the grid, the Brazilian used the races opening turn to surge ahead of his two McLaren rivals before building a comfortable lead.         
	With overtaking all but impossible on the rest of the twisting Hungaroring track, Massa saw his advantage boosted when Hamilton left the track on the 41st lap before limping into the pit lane with a punctured front left tyre.         
	Massa then suffered a much more costly problem when his engine died in front of the main grandstand with three laps to go, thus allowing Kovalainen to wrap up his unexpected victory.         
	Giancarlo Fisichella finished 15th even though his Force India teammate Adrian Sutil had to retire just eight laps away from the finish line.         
	Fisichella expressed satisfaction over his performance and said from here the team needs to take a step forward in the remaining races of the calendar.         
	It was a tough race as we were fighting quite a lot. We were quite heavy at the beginning of the race but the pace really wasnt too bad and i could keep up with the others in front of me.

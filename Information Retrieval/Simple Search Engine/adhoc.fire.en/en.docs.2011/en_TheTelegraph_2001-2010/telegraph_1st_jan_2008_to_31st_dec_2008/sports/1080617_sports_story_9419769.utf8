The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Czechs choke on Turkey
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Czechs choke on Turkey
  - Petr Cechs mistake leads to defeat in last few minutes       Jeremy Wilson in Geneva                                        Nihat Kahveci after his goal on Sunday		    
	With identical records following their group matches against Portugal and Switzerland, recent form had suggested a close match. History, however, pointed overwhelmingly in favour of the Czech Republic. Turkey had never previously beaten the Czech Republic and, at No. 20 in the Fifa rankings, stood some 14 places below their opponents.         
	Czech Republic began on the front foot.         
	Turkey were having difficulty in containing the Czech Republics precise and intricate passing.         
	The Czech football was enormously impressive  certainly their best of the tournament  yet Turkey dug deep to weather the initial pressure and they slowly begun to get some sort of foothold in the game.         
	Tuncay Sanli has been an industrious presence for Turkey throughout the tournament and, just as he improved throughout the season for Middlesbrough, his involvement gradually grew as the game progressed.         
	Turkey were playing with belief but, in the space of four minutes, they were struck by a desperately cruel double-blow. Centre-back Emre Gungor fell to the ground and looked in considerable pain as he punched the turf and pointed to his knee.         
	He was carried off and, as Emre Asik waited to come on as a substitute, Turkey were hit by a classic counter-punch. The excellent Sionko broke and crossed to the far post where Plasil slid in to double the lead. Turkey were down to 10-men at the time and a sense of anger and injustice radiated from their dugout.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds faces ban
                                                   Symonds faces ban
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Andrew Symonds faces being banned from the IPL if he decides to boycott the tour of Pakistan because of security fears.         
	Just hours before he became Australias richest cricketer, Symonds declared he would opt out of the tour, even if CA ruled the strife-torn country safe to tour next month.         
	While Symonds softened his stance later, claiming the door was ajar, he was warned even by captain Ricky Ponting that he would be in breach of contract if he ignored the advice of CA and the Australian Cricketers Association, according to a report in the Herald Sun.         
	Some CA officials said a dangerous precedent would be set if Symonds had his own way.

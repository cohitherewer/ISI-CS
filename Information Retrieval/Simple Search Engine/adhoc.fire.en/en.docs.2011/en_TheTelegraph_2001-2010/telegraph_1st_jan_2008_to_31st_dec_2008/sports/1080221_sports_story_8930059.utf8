	Wellington: New Zealand and England played out a dramatic tie in their fourth one-day International in Napier on Wednesday.         
	Both teams finished on 340 runs, leaving New Zealand with a 2-1 lead in the series with one match to play.         
	England batted first and made 340 for six with four players scoring half-centuries.         
	New Zealand lost seven wickets in their run chase with Jamie How top scoring with a superb 139 and Brendon McCullum making 58.         
	How was run out off the penultimate ball of the match, leaving the Black Caps requiring two runs off the final ball to win. However, captain Daniel Vettori could only manage a single off Luke Wrights delivery, leaving the teams all square.         
	Its a game we should have comfortably won after the positions we put ourselves in, Vettori said.         
	We have to give some credit to the way England bowled in those last six overs  they way they hit their lengths was outstanding, but I think we just threw it away, we were fortunate to get the tie in the end.         
	England captain Paul Collingwood thought his teams impressive batting performance was all in vain as the Black Caps closed in on victory in the final few overs.         
	Phil Mustard (83) and Alastair Cook (69) had given England the perfect start by putting on 158 for the opening wicket before they were dismissed in successive balls by Jesse Ryder.

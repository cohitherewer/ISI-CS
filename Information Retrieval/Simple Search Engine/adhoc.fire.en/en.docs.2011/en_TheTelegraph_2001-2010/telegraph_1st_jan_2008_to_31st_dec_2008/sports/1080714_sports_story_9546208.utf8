The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Another blot on CAB
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Another blot on CAB
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengals failure to rope in Woorkeri Raman as coach for the forthcoming season once again highlighted the lack of professionalism that has been responsible for the decay of the game in the state. Among the current administrations series of shortcomings, this is the latest instance.         
	Since coming to power in early 2007, the Prasun Mukherjee-led regime has failed to utilise the resources, culminating in Bengals demotion to the Plate Group last season. While the blame game refuses to finish, very little has been done to stop the slide. It all started with Bengals failure to retain Paras Mhambrey as coach last season. Bengal had reached the Ranji final for two consecutive years under him.         
	The former India pacer had waited for a response from the CAB before finalising a deal with Baroda. Had the CAB president agreed to Mhambreys demands and not resorted to dilly dallying, we could have retained Mhambrey, recalled former secretary Saradindu Pal, who was holding office then. To make matters worse, six members of the senior Bengal team, including captain Deep Dasgupta, decided to join the Indian Cricket League.         
	The CAB administration only managed to convince Laxmi Ratan Shukla to stay back, luring him with the offer of the Ranji captaincy. A move that finally resulted in a lot of internal bickering in the team.         
	This, along with the absence of six key players, is believed to have been responsible for Bengals pathetic performance. The rift between Shukla and Manoj Tiwary was an open secret. The CAB never tried to put an end to it, and as a result the performance suffered, said a member of the team management. It is significant that Tiwary has more or less decided to move out of Bengal this season.         
	The appointment of Bharat Arun, who had no proven credentials as coach, was also indicative of the decline. None of his suggestions were adhered to, and an influential official called the shots at selection meetings, the source added. Not just the Ranji Trophy, the decay spread to the junior levels as well. Runners-up Bengal failed to qualify for the knockout phase in the under-22 category. The story was no different in under-19 age-group. Bengal managed to make the next round only in under-17.         
	With nothing to show for, Mukherjee and Co. tried to pull off a coup by roping in Raman, who had coached Bengal to the Ranji final in 2001-02. But that, too, has come a cropper.         
	Trying to rope in Raman was an eyewash An election gimmick. , said Biswarup Dey, a Jagmohan Dalmiya confidant.         
	President Mukherjee refused to take calls. Joint secretary Amitava Banerjee said: You cannot win CAB elections by mere gimmick.         
	Tranparency is important Everyone has been talking about failures but none have highlighted that three players made it to India A

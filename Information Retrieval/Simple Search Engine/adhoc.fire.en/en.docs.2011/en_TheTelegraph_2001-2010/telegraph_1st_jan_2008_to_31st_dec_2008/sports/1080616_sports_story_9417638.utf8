The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | F1 bosses moot new series
                                                                                                                                                                                                       F1 bosses moot new series
            CHRISTIAN SYLT AMP; CAROLINE REED             Max Mosley                           
	London: It all started with a few slaps to the backside. However Max Mosleys now-infamous exploits seem set to spark a rival motor racing series that could leave F1, and RBS, its biggest creditor in the dust.         
	Mosley has single-handedly presided over one of the biggest scandals ever in the billion-dollar sport. Despite car companies and auto clubs representing tens of millions of motorists calling for him to step down as president of F1s governing body, the Federation Internationale de Automobile (FIA), he refused to resign following lurid revelations about his private life. Heads of state said even that they did not want to be seen with him, preventing Mosley from attending many of this years Grand Prix events.         
	Yet earlier this month Mosley won a vote of confidence from the FIAs members who viewed the attack on him as an attack on the federation. Mosley has made it abundantly clear that he is not leaving F1  but at last weeks Canadian Grand Prix, it came to light that F1 might instead leave Mosley.         
	A series of crisis meetings was held at the race to consider how the sport could survive the damage being done by Mosley to its slick and squeaky-clean reputation. More than 300 sponsors invest nearly 500m in supporting F1s 10 teams and expect this to bring image benefits to them  not association with a sordid scandal. One team boss reportedly said that many (sponsors) are even threatening to cease their payments if Formula 1 does not solve the problem with Mosley.         
	Chairing the meetings was Bernie Ecclestone, the 77-year-old chief executive of F1s commercial rightsholder, and he is said to have come up with the radical solution of starting a new series under a different brand to run outside the FIA.         
	In a case of stalemate over the future of F1, a new series would be one of the only ways forward. The commercial rights to F1 are in fact the commercial rights to the FIA Formula One World Championship since the FIA founded it in 1950. As a result of this, F1 could not be run under any other governing body and so the only way for the participants to distance themselves completely from the FIA would be to start a new series.         
	I dont think it is the first option. We would prefer to work with the FIA if we can, said Nick Fry, Honda GPs chief executive, when asked about the possibility of a breakaway series.

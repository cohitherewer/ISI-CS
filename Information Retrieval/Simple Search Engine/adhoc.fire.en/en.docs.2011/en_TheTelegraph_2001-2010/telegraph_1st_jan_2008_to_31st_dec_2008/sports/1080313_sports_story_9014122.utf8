                                                     Torres helps Liverpool   join English party
            HENRY WINTER            Steven Gerrard (left) and Fernando Torres celebrate the goal on Tuesday. (Reuters)                                 
	Red Square could live up to its name this year. Liverpool, and their giant army of foot soldiers, continued their route march towards the Moscow climax of the Champions League, reaching the quarter finals on Tuesday night with a gritty performance embellished by another example of Fernando Torress predatory arts.         
	Torres struck after 64 minutes, the life ebbing from Inters initially buoyant attempts to overturn a two-goal deficit when Nicolas Burdisso was dismissed. With Javier Mascherano exuding a they-shalt-not-pass vigour in midfield, Liverpool negotiated an occasionally tricky first half before gliding to victory and making it four Premier League clubs in the last eight.         
	So the English are coming. Well, make that the Frenchmen, Spaniards and Togolese who mix with some native talent from Croxteth and Romford in planting the Premier League flag firmly on European soil. News of Fridays 11am draw for the quarter finals and the semi-finals will spice up training sessions at Carrington, Melwood, London Colney and Cobham.         
	Schalke and Fenerbahce appear the easier options, if trips to Germany and Turkey can ever be so described. Everyone will want to avoid Roma and particularly Barcelona, although Lady Lucks sense of mischief may ensure the Premier League sides unleashed on each other. Everyone will want to avoid Torres, Mascherano and Liverpools other masters of the European arts.         
	Their hopes of reaching the last eight lifted by Burdissos dismissal early in the second half, Liverpool had been forced to endure some nervous moments before the break. Mascherano was magnificent, a source of constant defiance, but early nerves had betrayed Liverpool, allowing Inter to set up camp in the visitors half for substantial periods.         
	Zlatan Ibrahimovic showed Liverpool his threat with a fine run down the left. Lucas, stretching out a leg, prevented the ball from reaching the onrushing Esteban Cambiasso.         
	These were worrying times for Liverpool. Ryan Babel rarely looked at ease, his mood worsened by a caution for breaking early from the wall. Moments later, when racing through towards Inters goal, Babel never had any belief in his mission. Such hesitancy allowed Julio Cesar to step out calmly to claim the ball.         
	Still Inter pressured. Julio Cruz, a lively force, let fly from 25 yards, forcing Pepe Reina into a magnificent save, the Spaniard dropping quickly to his right and clawing the ball to safety. Cruz was a constant irritant, even leaving his foot in on Jamie Carragher.         
	A spiky intent suffused the champions of Serie A. Even the ball-boys launched balls to Inter players with the keenness and accuracy of expert scrum-halves. The determination to overcome Liverpools two-goal advantage was evident in everyone in black and blue.         
	Javier Zanetti, such a marvellous servant to Inters cause down the years, sought to control midfield, making a little dart here, a clever pass there. His fellow-Argentine, the impressive Mascherano, refused to allow Inters captain to dominate and bit back with tackle after tackle. They call Mascherano the Little Chief and his big-hearted display kept Liverpool in the game at times.         
	The siege briefly lifted near the half-hour mark, when Torres almost scored an away goal worth all the Inca gold in a laden Spanish galleon. Seizing on Cambiassos poor control, dragging the ball away from Burdisso, Torres arrowed in on goal, but just failed to manipulate his shot around Cesar.         
	 Already cautioned for a foul on Dirk Kuyt, Burdisso was living dangerously when he flew in on Lucas, catching the Brazilian with his thigh. Once again, an Inter centre-half made the long, lonely walk of shame following two yellow-card offences, Burdisso emulating Marco Materazzis Anfield stupidity.         
	Roberto Mancini re-organised his remaining forces, pushing Cristian Chivu to centre-half and dropping Zanetti to left-back, so depriving Inter of much of their momentum. Liverpool moved up a gear. Babel sprang to life, charging upfield, earning a free kick that Gerrard bent over Inters wall. Cesar again impressed with an excellent save, pushing the ball over. The fight went out of Inter. After 64 minutes, Maicon lost possession down the right and Fabio Aurelio took full advantage. Racing forward, he clipped the ball in to Torres, whose response was of the highest order, a thrilling reminder of why Liverpool fans spent most of the evening singing his name.         
	Turning Chivu with effortless ease, Torres unleashed an unstoppable shot from the edge of the area past Cesar. Inter needed four. Mission impossible. Liverpool were about to make it a Fab Four of Premier League sides in the quarter finals.

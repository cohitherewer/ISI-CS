	Kingston: West Indies restricted Australias progress on the second day of the first Test by picking up three wickets in the morning session as the tourists moved to 372 for seven.         
	After Ricky Pontings 158 led Australia to 301 for four overnight, West Indies pace bowler Fidel Edwards again caused problems with the new ball and the Australian batsmen found it hard to make any headway.         
	Edwards, who claimed both openers on the first day, dismissed Brad Hodge, caught behind for 67, to secure a vital wicket for West Indies.         
	Nightwatchman Mitchell Johnson (22) then spooned a soft catch to Daren Powell at mid-on off the bowling of Darren Sammy.         
	Andrew Symonds (18) struggled to get going against some lively pace bowling.           (REUTERS)

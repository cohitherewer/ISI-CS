The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Muralidharan averts dental loss
                                                   Muralidharan averts dental loss
                      
	 An emergency dental operation helped Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan retain his toothy smile, almost by the skin of his teeth! The worlds highest wicket-taker had his front tooth knocked back while fielding during Fridays match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Away from public eyes, the Lankan was rushed to the St Vincents hospital where dentist Dr Peter Foltyn, pressed into service when he was actually watching the match on television at home, completed the operation in under an hour to allow the cricketer to return to bat.         
	I was peeling potatoes when I got the call from the SCG, Dr Foltyn was quoted as saying by The Daily Telegraph. It was fortunate that I was available almost immediately. It took me about 10 minutes to get to St Vincents by car and Muralidharan was getting there as i arrived, he said. At the hospital, Dr Foltyn repositioned the tooth and splinted it but did not give any drugs for that would have forced the off-spinner to sit out of the remainder of the match. Muralidharan eventually returned to ground and hit a six before getting out.         
	Blasts add to doubt         
	 Australias tour of Pakistan had another blow when a suicide car bomber killed 37 people and wounded about 100 at a rally in the troubled nation. Australias players do not want to head to Pakistan next month, with Andrew Symonds admitting in December he would withdraw if not satisfied that Pakistan was a safe place, adds a report from Herald Sun.         
	We are planning to sit down with them in the next few days and we will follow the elections with interest, CA operations manager Michael Brown said.         
	5 Aussies set to sign         
	 Five Australian players were given a one-day extension to sign their Indian Premier League (IPL) contracts and they have until Monday to return the paperwork so franchises can bid for them on Wednesday. The unnamed players were seeking clarification on the contracts finer details but all were expected to sign after Cricket Australia (CA) gave them the green light.         
	There is always a chance (one of the five may not sign) but at this point we have alleviated any issues they have had, said Australian player agent Neil Maxwell, who has been working with organisers in negotiations. There hasnt been a great deal of time to digest the agreement.         
	Arnold admission         
	 Former Sri Lanka batsman Russel Arnold admitted he found the offer to join the ICL too tempting to resist but asserted the ICL moolah did not prompt him to drop early curtains on his career.         
	The Sydney-based player, a veteran of 44 Tests and 180 ODIs, quit international cricket after the World Cup last year and joined the ICL. But the retirement was not rushed because of the haste to join ICL, he said.         
	You need to look after yourself and if you can do that without harming anybody, then why not? Arnold told The Sydney Morning Herald. They might try (to make us look like rebels) but the IPL is the same thing.

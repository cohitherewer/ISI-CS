The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Superstars face Heroes in first semis
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Superstars face Heroes in first semis   
	Calcutta: The first semi-final at the Edelweiss 20s Challenge features defending champions Chennai Superstars and Hyderabad Heroes. Both teams started their campaign on a shaky note and gradually raised their performance.  
	Facing elimination after two defeats in their first two matches, the Chennai Superstars snatched victory from the jaws of defeat in a close encounter against the Kolkata Tigers. The defending champions have been delivering consistent performances. Hyderabad Heroes have been the most improved side as they gear up for their maiden semi-final appearance on their home turf. The Heroes have taken full advantage of the vociferous home fans. Like the Chennai Superstars, the success of the Heroes lies in the fact that their domestic players have gelled brilliantly with their international stars to produce some of the best cricket at the Edelweiss 20s Challenge.         
	The Heroes have beaten the Chennai Superstars in their previous encounter at the league stage. They have not lost a single match on home turf. They also possess two of the top five leading wicket takers.         
	Pak actor buys stake in ICL         
	 New Delhi: Buying stakes in Twenty20 teams seems in vogue for the actors and after Bollywood and Tollywood star Mithun Chakraborty, its the turn of Pakistan star Moammar Rana (Momi), to jump onto the bandwagon. The Indian Cricket League (ICL) on Wednesday announced that the Pakistan actor will have a stake in Lahore Badshahs and would promote the side both in India and Pakistan.         
	I am delighted to see the Lahore Badshahs perform so well. I am looking forward to be working with them and with the likes of Inzamam, Moin and Mushtaq Ahmed to take the Badshahs to the next level, the actor said in a statement.         
	I am sure that my fans will support my team, he added. Chairman Kapil Dev asid: After our association with Mithun Chakraborty, this is the latest development. The Lahore Badshahs have been a critical factor in getting an overwhelming response for the Edelweiss 20s Challenge.         
	Windies spin woes         
	 Port of Spain: Stories of the ill-treatment of spin bowlers at the hands of the West Indies selectors over the years are notorious. Truth be told, though, West Indies  who face Sri Lanka here in the second Test on Thursday  have only produced three world-class spin bowlers in the eight decades since their entry into Test cricket.         
	The selection of the beanpole left-arm spin bowler Sulieman Benn for the opening Test of two against Sri Lanka last week at the Guyana National Stadium has given hope that the selectors may finally be getting the message.         
	Benn conceded 120 runs from 40 overs in the first innings without success. But West Indies coach John Dyson believes it was satisfactory, and seems prepared to give him a chance in the second Test. In assessing his performance, you have got to say that the pitch was a batsmans paradise, Dyson said.         
	It didnt help the fast bowlers, and it didnt help the spinners, and I thought he bowled very, very well for his first Test.

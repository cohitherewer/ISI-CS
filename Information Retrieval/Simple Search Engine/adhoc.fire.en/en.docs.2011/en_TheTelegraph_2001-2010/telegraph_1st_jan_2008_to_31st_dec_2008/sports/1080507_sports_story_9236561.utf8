                                                                                                                                                                                                       Roger Federer settles scores with Canas
                  Roger Federer in action on Tuesday                     
	Rome: Roger Federer settled a score with his bogey player Guillermo Canas on Tuesday, easing his way into the third round of the Rome Masters with a 6-3, 6-3 victory.         
	Canas went into the game as one of the few players on the Tour to hold a winning record against the world No. 1, but Tuesdays result evens things up at three wins apiece.         
	Federer made an assured start, breaking Canas in the middle of the first set before producing two aces and a delightful drop shot to hold his serve to love at the end of it.         
	The Argentine came closest to breaking his opponent in the sixth game of the second set, when Federer was lucky to save a break point with a net-cord winner.         
	Federer, beaten finalist here in 2003 and 2006, never looked back, breaking Canass serve twice in winning the last three games.         
	Rafael Nadal, aiming for his fourth consecutive Rome Masters title, will meet unseeded 2001 champion Juan Carlos Ferrero in a second-round match on Wednesday after his compatriot came from behind to beat German Nicolas Kiefer 6-7, 6-3, 6-4.         
	Andy Roddick got his clay-court season off to a solid start, beating Mardy Fish 6-1, 6-4 in an all-American match-up. In the first round, 14th-seeded Tommy Robredo defeated Juan Ignacio Chela 6-4, 6-1.         
	Andy Murray, meanwhile, claims Juan Martin Del Potro insulted his mother during a first-round match.         
	Someone saying something about your mother who is one of the nicest ladies youre ever going to meet? I dont think thats really that cool, Murray said after Del Potro retired while trailing 7-5, 4-6, 0-1 late on Monday.         
	Judy Murray provided vocal support for her son from the stands during the match. Andy did not elaborate on the nature of the alleged insults by Del Potro, an Argentine qualifier.

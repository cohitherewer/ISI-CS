                                        Symonds needs lsquo;mental rehab rsquo;  Calcutta: Troubled Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds has been told to get psychological help and will not join the touring party to India next month as he ponders whether he will quit international cricket, according to Australia rsquo;s Daily Telegraph, says A Staff Reporter. It is understood the strife-torn cricketer has been asked to go on a mental rehabilitation programme, overseen by Cricket Australia medical staff, in which he would see counsellors about his state of mind.  It may be a similar recovery regime to that undertaken by fast bowler Shaun Tait, who withdrew from cricket in January citing mental exhaustion. It is also understood Symonds, sent home from Darwin after going fishing instead of attending a compulsory team meeting, has no chance of touring India in October as he spends time deciding whether he wants to return to international cricket.

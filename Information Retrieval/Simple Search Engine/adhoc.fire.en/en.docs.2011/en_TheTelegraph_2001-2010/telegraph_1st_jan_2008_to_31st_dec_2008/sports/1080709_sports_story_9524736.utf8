The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Better not think about Ashes next summer
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Better not think about Ashes next summer

	In exactly a years time, Australia will begin their defence of the Ashes in Cardiff. At present, the rebuilt ground there is known as the Swalex Stadium, after South Wales Electricity. But that will clash with Englands Test-match sponsors, the energy suppliers npower, so the name will be dropped for those five days as crickets greatest and most enduring brand attempts to work its magic once more.         
	Make no mistake, crickets greatest brand is what the Ashes are, no matter who sponsors them or how much money the rupee rajahs of the Indian Premier League want to dangle before our eyes. It will endure, too, for as Kevin Pietersen made plain in his newspaper column at the weekend  money cannot buy the feeling he and his teammates experienced when they won the Ashes at the Oval in 2005.         
	For those who see that incredible series as an anomaly, a return to the result of that heady summer may not be out of the question despite the 5-0 drubbing of England by Ricky Pontings side in Australia 18 months ago. For one thing, the Aussies will be without Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, with others possibly joining the pair in retirement (wrist-spinner Stuart MacGill already has) should obsolescence catch up with them.         
	Indeed, Matthew Hayden, 37, (Achilles tendon) and Ponting, who has undergone surgery to his wrist, might not find their injuries so easy to shake off. England also have fitness worries. Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones  who shared 50 per cent of Australias wickets in 2005  have made significant strides towards bowling at full pace again.         
	But a few dozen overs for your county are not the same as competing at full-tilt throughout an Ashes series.         
	Both could be back soon, though the temptation to resurrect the bowling attack that won the urn in 2005  something Duncan Fletcher was seduced by last time in Australia  must be resisted unless it is merited at the time of selection. Yet the possibility is already boosting competition for places, as James Anderson, one of Englands bowlers, admits.         
	We regard it as an extra incentive, Anderson said on Monday. Theres not just Freddie Flintoff were looking over our shoulders at, though hes obviously the biggest of the lot trying to get back.         
	Theres also Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones now back bowling well and players like Sajid Mahmood and Liam Plunkett desperate to get back. Youve got these guys taking wickets, so youve got to keep doing the same to keep your place.         
	Then there is the robustness of Michael Vaughan, for many a crucial ingredient if England are to once again hoist the urn. Vaughans right knee has been playing up of late, which is not good news for those hoping he will be around to lead the team next summer. More than anyone, Vaughans career is defined by the 2005 Ashes. But having missed the whitewash that followed, he will be determined to get another Ashes victory on the CV before that troublesome knee calls time on him.         
	England should know more about their chances against Australia after this summer, with their latest opponents, South Africa, built along similar lines. There is no doubt that the Aussies will be more vulnerable than the last time England played them, though that will not mean they will be any less combative, which is why Englands preparation, the remit of coach Peter Moores, needs to be carefully thought out.         
	The last time England contested the urn, the hype and build-up to the series were so intense that the players were emotionally drained before a ball had been bowled. Little wonder then that when the time came, Harmison sent the first ball straight to second slip. As that experience led to only the second Ashes whitewash in history, far better to distract the players by keeping them busy, rather than allowing them to dwell too much.

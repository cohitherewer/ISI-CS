            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni during a practice session in Cuttack on Tuesday. Picture by Gautam Bose                           
	Cuttack: Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday confirmed that the side will make a few changes in the playing XI when they take on England in the fifth match of the series on Wednesday.         
	Dhoni also stressed on the importance of testing the bench-strength.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the changes in the side         
	There will be few changes in the side. Which players will exactly sit out we cannot confirm right now, but definitely there will be a few changes.         
	On maintaining the intensity         
	We have to keep up the commitment and intensity though we have already won the series. One of the reasons why the intensity will be up is because some of the players, who have been on the bench, will get a chance to play in the coming game. So they will want to perform and prove themselves. That will really help to keep the intensity up.         
	On trying to beat England 7-0 to take the second spot in ODI rankings         
	We are not thinking much on that whether to win 7-0 or 5-2...         
	His message to the youngsters         
	They need to go out there and look to enjoy cricket... If they are too desperate, then their chances of being successful goes down. You should be relaxed, calm and cool. You have nothing really to prove. Everybody knows you are talented, so you are part of the international squad. At times, I personally feel, when you want to perform and do things, you end up putting pressure on yourself. So its better to be in a positive frame of mind.         
	On where India needs to improve         
	As a team we want to improve in each and every department. Its a constant process... Everything right from batting, bowling, fielding, running between the wickets have to be improved. You should never be in a situation when you think that theres no scope for improvement.         
	How important will be the toss?         
	Tough to say... You get some amount of dew. Toss may play an important role. We will see how it goes. I cannot really say right now.         
	On England skipping practice on Tuesday         
	It does not really bother us. We are too much into what we want to do. We are not thinking what the opposition is doing or what their plan of action is because we are looking into the aspects that are in our control. We had an optional session. The guys who wanted to rest stayed back at the hotel, spending some time in the gym. At times, it helps also... Its not always about going onto the field and practising. Sometimes rest helps you more than a good session of practice.         
	The year has been good for Indian cricket         
	We have done well as a team. We have individual performers who have done splendidly when the spinners were not in form, there were fast bowlers taking the wickets and complementing each other. At the same time, the batsmen are doing their job... Even the lower order is contributing.         
	If the ICC should start thinking about the Duckworth-Lewis method         
	Honestly speaking, I dont understand Duckworth-Lewis... I just wait for the umpires to decide.         
	If its wise to rest an in-form player         
	It is tough, but at the same time for the teams benefit, you have to look at a few changes... Especially the guys who are sitting out you want them to play games. Very often what happens the guys who are part of the side for two or three series, in the end figure in only one or two matches. Moreover, in that period, they are not playing domestic games. Usually they end up practising in the nets where they dont get the best of bowlers. So this is an opportunity when we can give them a chance to play... Not always, you lead a series 4-0. But we will not be making too many changes. May be one or two in batting and one in bowling department so that we still play with our best team.         
	On Yuvraj Singhs brilliant form         
	Yuvraj is a very talented player. When he gets going, he is one of the toughest batsmen to bowl to. He scores in every part of the ground. When he bats well, his overall cricket goes up not only just his batting  his bowling and fielding too improve. It has been good to see him score loads of runs. You always have to believe in that kind of a player.         
	If he is going to propose anybodys name in the selection meeting for next two ODIs         
	Sir uske liye meeting hoga udhar... Why do you want me to say...

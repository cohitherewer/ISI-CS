The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tribunal split on Shoaib
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tribunal split on Shoaib
                  Shoaib Akhtar                     
	Karachi: With the Pakistan Cricket Board-instituted appellate tribunal divided on whether to reduce the five-year ban on Shoaib Akhtar or uphold it, a decision on the maverick pacers fate has been delayed by almost a week.         
	After Sundays hearing in which the legal counsels for Akhtar and the PCB presented their arguments, tribunal head Justice (retd) Aftab Farrukh said a final decision on the matter was unlikely before June 14.         
	We have adjourned the proceedings until June 14. The decision can come on that date or a few days after that, he said.         
	Farrukh said a tribunal member, Hasib Ahsan, was unwell and did not attend the hearing but he has given his go-ahead on telephone.         
	He is expected to recover and be available for the next hearing, Farrukh said.         
	Tafazzul Rizvi, the legal counsel for the board, also said a decision on the matter would be out after the June 14 hearing.         
	I am confident that we will get a final judgement soon after the next hearing if not on it, Rizvi said.         
	Meanwhile, sources close to the tribunal said decision has been delayed due to lack of consensus among the members on whether to remove the ban, reduce it or accept the boards stand.         
	The legal counsel for the fast bowler, Abid Hasan Minto in his arguments recalled that Shoaib had made a public apology for his past deeds and statements and was willing to reform himself, the source said.         
	Even the tribunal head gave indications of differences among the members, saying that a final decision would be out only after there was consensus among the panel.         
	The tribunal head has the final vote if there is a hung verdict.         
	There are indications that the tribunal considers the five-year ban imposed by the disciplinary committee of the board too harsh and may reduce it considerably or even convert it into a fine or a ban of few matches.

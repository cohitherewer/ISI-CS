                                                   Indians have Aussies on the run

 - If theres any wicket where 400 can be knocked off, its at the Waca, feels Justin Langer 
   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
              
	Perth: The tables have turned. And how! 
    
	Having got used to decimating opponents, on the field and in the mind, the Australians are in the unenviable position of doing all the chasing in the third 3 mobile Test. 
    
	The agenda has, indeed, been set by Team India and theres every chance of Australias phenomenal sequence of wins (16 in a row) coming to an end at the Waca on Saturday. 
    
	Seven years ago, Australias equally awe-inspiring run had ended at the hands of India. 
    
	Will history (so to say) be repeated? That too at a venue, arguably the quickest and with the most bounce on the circuit, where nobody gave Anil Kumble and his men any chance? 
    
	Oh, its been an incredible Test. 
    
	Needing 413 to win, 44 more than the highest target ever achieved in Australia (against Pakistan, Hobart, 1999-00), the hosts ended Day III on 65 for two. 
    
	Ricky Ponting and Co. require 348 more and while two days remain, those runs are six in excess of the maximum chased at the Waca  versus India, in 1977-78. 
    
	Look, if theres any wicket where 400 can be knocked off, its at the Waca... Its a beauty for the batsmen... Weve lost the openers, but Id never write off Australia, former opener Justin Langer told The Telegraph. 
    
	Ex-captain Mark Taylor felt one of the overnighters, Ponting or Michael Hussey, wouldve to get at least 150. Otherwise, the writing is splashed across the Perth walls. 
    
	The Australians, seen by many as arrogant with a capital A, have only themselves to blame. Coach Tim Nielsen admitted as much. 
    
	Were facing the heat for an under-par batting performance in the first innings (212 all out in 50 overs)... Its our own doing, he said candidly. 
    
	With a bit of disgust too. 
    
	Actually, had the bowlers done their bit, Australia wouldve ended up chasing much less. For, at one stage in their second innings, the visitors were gasping at 125 for five. 
    
	Another poor decision from Asad Rauf sent Rahul Dravid back and, then, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly also returned to the pavilion all too quickly. 
    
	Sachin got deceived by Brett Lee, who was outstanding throughout, while Sourav played into Mitchell Johnsons hands. 
    
	Given that he hasnt been keeping well, its a matter of debate whether Sourav shouldve opted out of the Test. But, then, his critics wouldve linked that to the reputation of the Waca. 
    
	Forget trips to the doctor and blood tests, Souravs chest x-ray was done on Day II. Yet, that wont figure in the records, instead it will be scores of 9 and 0. 
    
	With the Big 3 out in quick succession  it led to the dropping of shoulders in the dressing room, pointed out somebody who was there  it was left to the largely unsung V.V.S. Laxman to mount a recovery. 
    
	He did so with a string of partnerships, the most telling being 51 for the ninth-wicket with Rudra Pratap Singh. 
    
	Rudra Pratap was the bigger contributor and, according to Laxman, had been comfortable facing Shaun Tait, whod been picked to make an impact! 
    
	Nielsen, though, defended the move to replace Brad Hogg with Tait. Hindsight is a wonderful thing to have, but I think we chose the right attack for the conditions... 
    
	Ponting wasnt able to manage his four quicks and the unbelievable lack of urgency resulted in Australia being so far behind on the over-rate that he had to introduce part-time spinners when the quicks couldve been more effective. 
    
	Nielsen, of course, denied that the possibility of a 17th consecutive win would put his batsmen under more pressure. It could, instead, be a big motivator... The target we have now is achievable, but well have to take it hour by hour and look at partnerships, he explained. 
    
	With the first two Tests going Australias way, we cant take the series even if we create history at the Waca and win in Adelaide as well. 
    
	But, then, thats only part of the story as a win here is bound to be counted among the most memorable. 
    
	The entire fraternity is watching, not just the billion and more at home. 
    
	Incidentally, while the Kumbles appeared calm in the hours before a huge day, manager Chetan Chauhan seemed to have allowed the excitement to get the better of him. 
    
	Were winning... Why are you asking? he asserted. For that dream to become reality, though, Ponting will have to be quickly evicted.

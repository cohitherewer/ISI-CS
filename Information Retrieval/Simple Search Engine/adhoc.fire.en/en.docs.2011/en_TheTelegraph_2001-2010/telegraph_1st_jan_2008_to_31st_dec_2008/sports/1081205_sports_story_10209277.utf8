	Melbourne: With the top cricketers demanding more pay and less work, Cricket Australia faces a potential players revolt, according to media report here.         
	According to a newspaper investigation, the Australian cricketers feel their contract is too demanding while the likes of Andrew Symonds are okay with less pay if that means a reduction in media interaction and appearance with the sponsors. Symonds, in fact, offered a Australian $250,000 cut to be spared the media and sponsor interactions.         
	According to existing norms, the cricketers make 22 sponsorship appearances in a year for CA and their state associations.         
	Australian Cricketers Association chief executive Paul Marsh said media and sponsorship obligation would top the agenda when CA meets later this month over a new memorandum of understanding.         
	Thats been an ongoing issue. How do you fit it all in between games? Marsh said.         
	Players understand the sponsors are important. Its about finding the balance, the ACA chief said. (PTI)

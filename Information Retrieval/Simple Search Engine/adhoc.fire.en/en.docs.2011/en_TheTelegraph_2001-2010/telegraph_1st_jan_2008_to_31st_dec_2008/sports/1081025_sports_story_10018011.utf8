The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB sacks Lawson
                                                                                                                                                                                             PCB sacks Lawson

	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday sacked coach Geoff Lawson, nearly six months before the completion of his contract.         
	The former Australian pacer has been given three months pay as per his contractual clause and told to leave. The decision to release Lawson has been taken by the chairman, a board official said.         
	Former Test captain Intikhab Alam is being tipped to become Pakistan coach for next months one-day series against the West Indies in Abu Dhabi, following Lawsons sacking.         
	Intikhab said he had not been informed about any appointment as yet but if an offer was made to him he would consider it as he was keen to serve Pakistan cricket.         
	In another major decision, PCB chairman Ejaz Butt also sacked chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi, replacing him with his trusted aide and former Test pacer Saleem Altaf.         
	Altaf will be the Director-General of the board with additional powers of chief operating officer.         
	Lawsons contract was to expire next year, but the PCB wants to make a fresh target and build a new set-up. So it was decided to release him with full compensation, one official said. He said Lawson has been informed about the boards decision.         
	Butt has been highly critical of the performance of Lawson, and had described him as a useless person at his first press conference last Monday.         
	Butt had made it clear that Lawsons contract would not be renewed next year. Lawson was hired in August last year after the untimely death of Bob Woolmer during the World Cup.

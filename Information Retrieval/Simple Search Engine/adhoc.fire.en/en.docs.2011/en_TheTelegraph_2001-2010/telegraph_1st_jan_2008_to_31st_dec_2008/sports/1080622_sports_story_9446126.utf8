The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pole is for Kimi in Ferrari 1-2
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pole is for Kimi in Ferrari 1-2
                                  
	Magny-Cours: World champion Kimi Raikkonen handed Ferrari their 200th pole position in Formula One in a front row sweep for the Italian team at the French Grand Prix on Saturday.         
	Felipe Massa, who took pole at Magny-Cours last year, was second fastest to secure the Italian teams third one-two in qualifying this season.         
	The pole, the 16th of Raikkonens Grand Prix career, left the Finn perfectly placed to repeat his 2007 victory at the circuit.         
	Polands Robert Kubica, the championship leader for BMW-Sauber after his victory in Canada earlier this month, qualified seventh but will start sixth because of a 10-place penalty on Lewis Hamilton.         
	Hamilton, who picked up the punishment after crashing into Raikkonen in the Canadian Grand Prix pit lane, qualified third and will start 13th.         
	His demotion left Renaults double world champion Fernando Alonso sharing the second row with Italian Jarno Trulli in a Toyota. McLarens Heikki Kovalainen moved up to fifth. Kubica leads Hamilton and Massa by four points in the championship with Raikkonen a further three adrift after seven races.         
	Its the best possible chance to win the race from the first place and the car has been good all weekend, so hopefully we will get some good points here, said Raikkonen, who has failed to score in two previous starts.         
	Force India drivers Giancarlo Fisichella and Adrian Sutil will start at the back of the grid after being eliminated in the first qualifying session.           (AGENCIES)

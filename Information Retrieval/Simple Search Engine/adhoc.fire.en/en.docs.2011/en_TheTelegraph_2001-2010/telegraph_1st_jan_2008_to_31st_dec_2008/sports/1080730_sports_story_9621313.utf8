	 Name: Michael Johnson         
	 Country: United States         
	 Date of birth: 1967-09-13         
	 Birthplace: Dallas         
	 Height: 185 cm         
	 Weight: 78.0 kg         
	 Disciplines: 200m, 400m, 4x400m relay         
	 World Records: 5 (200m, 400m, 4x400m) Olympic Games (5 medals - 5 gold)         
	 200m: 1st (1996)         
	 400m: 1st (1996, 2000)         
	 4x400m relay: 1st (1992, 2000) World championships (9 medals - 9 gold)         
	At the Atlanta Games of 1996 Michael Johnson not only became the first athlete to take Olympic golds in both the 200m and 400m, but shattered the 200m world record with an eye-opening time of 19.32sec.         
	Johnson suffered a niggling hamstring problem after the 1996 Games which curtailed his 1997 campaign, but unfortunately for his opponents he was still ready for the 2000 Sydney Games. His idiosyncratic upright running style, with little knee lift and short rapid strides, makes the Dallas-born athlete easy to spot in a race.         
	With this unique and highly successful technique under his belt, he exploded onto the public consciousness in 1990 when he became the best in the world at both 200 and 400m.         
	He then went on to establish an impressive run of 32 straight wins at 200m from May 1990 to June 1992, and 58 400m finals in a row from 1990 to 1997. Johnson also formed part of the winning Barcelona relay team which smashed the 23-year-old 4x400m world record in a time of 2:55.74.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Grudge match for Kings XI Punjab
                      
	Chennai: Having lost their home tie against Chennai Super Kings, Yuvraj Singh would be keen to settle scores as Kings XI Punjab take on the hosts in an Indian Premier League encounter tie at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium Saturday.         
	The absence of Australian players among Chennai ranks  Mike Hussey and Matthew Hayden  and New Zealander Jacob Oram gives Yuvraj the perfect chance not only to take revenge for the early defeat but to increase their chances of making the semi-finals as well.         
	Yuvraj and his men had a strenuous three-hour nets session on Friday though the hosts, who returned home after their four-wicket over Delhi DareDevils, remained indoors.         
	Injury may have ruled out their in-form opener Kumar Sangakkara, but Yuvraj said his team had the balance to remain unaffected by the Sri Lankans absence.           (PTI)

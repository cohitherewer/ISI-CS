            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: The champions will be separated from the challengers in a matter of hours at the ongoing 4th Asian Womens Boxing Championship here as it enters its final leg on Sunday.         
	Taking a shot at the crown would be crowd favourite Kalpana Choudhury, who joined defending champions L Sarita Devi and MC Mary Kom in the race for individual golds.         
	The entry of the three girls from the north east into the final of their respective weight categories Saturday evening also fuelled hopes of India retaining the team championship.         
	The hosts are assured of atleast nine silver and a bronze after the semi-finals but they face strong challenge from DPR Korea and China.         
	Kalpana overcame a stiff challenge to upset defending champion Ri Jong Hyang of DPR Korea 3-1 in the light flyweight (48kg) category semi-finals to book the final berth.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gambhir excited by ICC move
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Team India opener Gautam Gambhir is excited about the prospect of challenging the on-field umpires during the tri-series in Sri Lanka.         
	Talking to the reporters on the sidelines of a promotional here on Tuesday, the Delhi batsman said he was eagerly looking forward to see how the new system functions during Indias tour of Sri Lanka.         
	It is a new concept and all cricketers would be enthusiastic to see how it shapes up, Gambhir said. It is difficult to say how it will work unless we play there, he said.         
	Gambhir was not ready to accept that the review system might make the game too dependent on technology. According to him, it will only serve to protect the interest of the game.         
	On several occasions we have seen how a wrong decision has changed the result of the game, he said. It has made tremendous impact on the losing side. If this system is ratified, all teams will get a fair chance and the matches would be more interesting, he added.         
	The 26-year-old opener, however, conceded that the review system would take away the aspect of human element from the game.

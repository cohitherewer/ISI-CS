	New Delhi: The disappointing defeat of Akhil Kumar in the Olympic quarter finals notwithstanding, the Government is planning to invest a lot of money for the improvement of boxing in India.         
	According to ministry of sports sources, sports minister M.S. Gill is so impressed by the performance of the Indian pugilists that he has asked the concerned officials to chalk out a mega plan for the game. Once the Olympic is over, the ministry may announce big plans, sources said. It includes huge infrastructural assistance for the Bhiwani Boxing Club (BBC), which has been producing scores of boxers for the past five years. BBC coach Jagdish Singh said the Government should help in creating more facilities for the game.

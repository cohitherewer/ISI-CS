The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Best birthday present ever: Kevin
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Best birthday present ever: Kevin
                      
	London: Kevin Pietersen did not seem overly concerned by the problems of captaincy after being thrust into the leadership of the England team for Saturdays final one-day International against New Zealand here at Lords.         
	England need to win to end their five-match series with the Black Caps all square at 2-2.         
	But Pietersen told reporters at Lords here on Friday: If we do everything we said in our team meeting, Ill be smoking a cigar at mid-off.         
	The South Africa-born Pietersen celebrated his 28th birthday and the Hampshire batsman added: Its an amazing job, an amazing honour and I am thrilled to bits. Its the best birthday present ever, I guess.         
	I think Ill be a similar captain to the kind of person I am. Ill be calm, pretty chilled and let my gut instincts and feelings guide me.         
	But Daniel Vettori said England would miss Durham all-rounder Collingwood as a cricketer even more than a captain. He leaves a gaping hole. We think hes their best player with his all-round capabilities.         
	Pietersen has huge shoes to fill but hes the sort of guy who seems to demand that sort of attention.         
	Tactically, I think I am pretty sound and aware of certain situations, Pietersen said.         
	But he added: This is a temporary job. Paul Collingwood has done a fantastic job, hes the skipper.         
	The main objective is not worrying about me, its about making sure we win and draw the series.           (AFP)

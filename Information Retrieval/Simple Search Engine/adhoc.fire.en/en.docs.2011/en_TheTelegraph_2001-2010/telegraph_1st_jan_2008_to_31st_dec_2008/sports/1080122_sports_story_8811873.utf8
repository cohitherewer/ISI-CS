                                                    Tait fears the worst

         Shaun Tait 
          
	Adelaide: Australian pacer Shaun Tait Monday admitted that his flop-show in the Perth Test has all but ended his chances of being selected for the fourth and final Test against India starting January 24. 
    
	Im not sure if Ill keep my spot here to be honest, by the look of things, Tait said. 
    
	Tait, who was touted as a wicket-taking machine by skipper Ricky Ponting, came a cropper in Perth and went wicket-less besides adding to Australias slow over-rate woes. 
    
	However, the 24-year-old remained optimistic about getting a chance in the forthcoming triangular ODI series also featuring Sri Lanka. 
    
	Well see how we go in the (Australia) one-day games and things coming up. Hopefully Ill get the chance to be a part of the squad there again, he said. 
    
	Tait said he lacked practice going into the Perth Test and probably would have done better with a warm-up match under his belt. 
    
	A touch underdone, to be honest. We are professional cricketers and we are training all the time and theres probably no reason why we should be underdone, he said. 
    
	But the fact is I hadnt had a whole lot of cricket under my belt and, obviously, there were limited opportunities to bowl as well due to (slow) over rates and things like that. There will be another game where I get a chance to do well, Tait explained. 
    
	Hoping to learn from the Perth debacle, Tait said he would prove to be a better bowler in future matches. 
    
	If I do get the chance to play in the Test arena (again), hopefully it will be a bit more fruitful, he said. 
    
	Tait said like the rest of his team, he too was dejected at losing the match which ended Australias 16-Test winning streak. 
    
	Very much so. Obviously from a team perspective and individually, he said. 
    
	But at the end of the day, its only a game and there will be another time where it might be a good day for me and the team as well, he added. (AGENCIES)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             
	New Delhi: The India under-19 team will get a lifetime opportunity to play against some of the worlds most famous clubs when they take part in the Champions Youth Cup in Malaysia.         
	According to AIFF sources, the organisers of the high profile tournament  which will also feature junior teams from clubs like Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Chelsea, AC Milan, Juventus, Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven  agreed to include India on insistence of the AFC president.         
	The tournament is scheduled to take place from August 2 to 17.         
	AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi might have disappointed many on Monday, when he refused to allow Bhaichung Bhutia and other Mohun Bagan players in the national team to play in the one-off exhibition tie against Bayern Munich in Calcutta.         
	On Wednesday, he, along with AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, played a vital role in convincing the promoters of the tournament to include India in the meet.         
	Out of the 16 teams in the fray, India are the lowest ranked side. While 12 teams are famous club sides, the under-19 national teams of Malaysia, Qatar, Japan and India complete the 16-team draw. Japan, however, are yet to confirm participation.         
	AIFF sources said that Das Munshi and Colaco, who were in Kuala Lumpur for the past couple of days to attend the AFC meetings, clinched the deal after AFC president Mohammed Bin Hammam strongly recommended Indias participation.         
	Hammam also took personal initiative to set up a meeting between the AIFF officials and the promoters of the tournament.         
	The AIFF at the moment doesnt have an under-19 team ready. A national camp will be called from June 1 in Goa under the guidance of technical director Collin Toal, who is currently busy with the under-16 team that has qualified for the final rounds of the Asian championships.         
	The AFC is also exploring the idea of allotting the under-16 Asian meet to India in near future.         
	Teams participating in the Champions Youth Cup are Manchester United, Chelsea, AC Milan, Juventus, FC Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Ajax, PSV Eindhoven, FC Porto, Olympique Lyonnais, Flamengo, River Plate, Malaysia U-19, Qatar U-19, India U-19 and Japan U-19.

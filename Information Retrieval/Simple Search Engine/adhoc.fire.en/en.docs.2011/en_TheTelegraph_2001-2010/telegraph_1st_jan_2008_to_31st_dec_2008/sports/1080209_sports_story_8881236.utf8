	New Delhi: Leander Paes decision to play rookie Somdev Dev Varman ahead of Prakash Amritraj didnt pay any dividends as India and Uzbekistan were locked 1-1 at the end of the first day of the Davis Cup tie on Friday.         
	On a chilly and windy day, India began brightly as Rohan Bopanna played flawless tennis to put the hosts ahead with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 victory over Farrukh Dustov in 72 minutes.         
	But once the sun shone in the afternoon, India faded away. Big serving Denis Istomin came up with some stunning display to outgun Somdev in straight sets in a two-hour battle.         
	The Indian debutant was not entirely disgraced but the 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win was a clear testimony of the Uzbeks absolute command over the proceedings.         
	Though the Indian plan of turning the tie into a dead rubber by Sunday afternoon went ashtray, Paes said he was happy at the end of the first day.         
	The day was a success, though not a grand success, the skipper said. When we played them the last time, we were down 0-2.         
	Today, Rohan played excellent tennis. He is also playing superbly in doubles.         
	With Mahesh (Bhupathi) also there, it is Uzbekistan who are on the back foot. India are in the drivers seat.         
	In the morning, India looked all over their opponents.         
	The start of the tie got delayed by 85 minutes because of slightly soggy court conditions. But once it started, Bopanna looked eager to make up for the lost time.         
	Dustov, who struggled throughout to cope up with the grass court, found the Bangalore based player too hot to handle.         
	In the first set, Bopanna didnt drop a point on his service and broke the Uzbek in the sixth game. Dustov played with an extreme forehand grip and preferred to stay near the baseline. It didnt improve the situation.         
	There was hardly any change in script in the last two sets. Altogether, Bopanna hit eight aces and played some outstanding shots. No wonder, he later termed it as one of his best matches in life.         
	Istomin, on the other hand, is man of wonderful skills. He exhibited allround court craft and sent some terrific returns early in the tie to take control of the situation.         
	In spite of the Indians best efforts, Istomin forced Somdev to play the second fiddle throughout the encounter.         
	Istomins ability to rise to the occasion at crucial points made all the difference. Somdev, who didnt look too comfortable on grass, played his hearts out and offered a close call in almost every point.         
	But that didnt unnerve his opponent as the world No. 184 came up with a winner every time.         
	Somdev was beaten but was not disgraced. He made his more fancied rival fight for every point.         
	His best came in the ninth game of the first set when he forced five deuces before Istomin could serve for the set.         
	If Somdevs display on Friday is any indication then the youngster is here to stay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India lose the plot as Pakistan stay afloat
                                                                                                                                                                                                       India lose the plot as Pakistan stay afloat
  - ANOTHER MUST-WIN MATCH FOR TEAM INDIA TODAY         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Pakistans Younis Khan (left) being congratulated by Misbah-ul Haq after the former reached his century against India during their Asia Cup match in Karachi on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	Karachi: Regular captain Shoaib Malik collapsed during a pre-match fitness test, on Wednesday afternoon, but that wasnt ominous for Pakistans men in green.         
	Stand-in captain Misbah-ul Haq lost the toss and the Virender Sehwag-Gautam Gambhir duo smashed 89 in the first 10 overs. Then, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Rohit Sharma added 112 for the fifth wicket to help post a 300-plus total.         
	However, with the Team India bowlers erring both in line and length (three of the regulars went for over 60), even 308 for seven wasnt enough and Pakistans hopes of making Sundays Asia Cup final havent been extinguished.         
	Clearly, after writing a decent script, the Indians lost the plot in a hurry. Pakistan won by eight wickets, ending the win-less run of 25 years against India in the commercial capital.         
	Now, for India, Thursdays face-off against Sri Lanka has become a must-win contest. Another such situation, actually.         
	Incidentally, Pakistans match-winning start (80 for one in the first 10 overs) was witnessed, among others, by Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani. He spent around half-an-hour at the National Stadium.         
	As I happened to be in Karachi on a day of an India-Pakistan game, I decided to drop by and give moral support to our players, the dapper Gilani told the media.         
	[The Prime Minister also reassured the doubters about security during the Champions Trophy in September].         
	Of course, Fridays Pakistan-Bangladesh match, the last Super Four engagement, will have no fizz if India beat Lanka. Mahela Jayawardene and Co. have already qualified for the title-round.         
	Assuming India cant put it across Lanka, Pakistan will have the huge advantage of knowing exactly whats required of them: As it turns out, a simple win.         
	Well be back at the ground just 14 or so hours later... Its a do-or-die game for us... Its going to be demanding, but as professionals, were expected to cope with it, remarked captain Dhoni.         
	The loss of three wickets within three runs and in less than two overs hurt India badly and Dhoni, it appeared, couldnt get over it. The chance to make amends, though, is there  only, the Lankans have been playing superbly.         
	Its expected that theyll go all out as they probably wouldnt like to face Team India in the final.         
	Misbah isnt the very expressive kind, but he has much more of a presence than Malik. He looked in control, even when the Indians were heading towards a big total and the body language of the team, for a change, was praiseworthy.         
	The body language remained positive throughout, perhaps more so when Salman Butt (one of Shah Rukh Khans Knights) and Nasir Jamshed launched the reply.         
	If Sehwag and Gambhir had torn into Sohail Tanvir (first spell 3-0-31-0), the Pakistani openers took Praveen Kumar to the cleaners (3-0-28-0 in spell No.1). Then, Ishant Sharmas opening over cost as many as 16.         
	Butt got run out and the fiesty Jamshed (hes always fearless, former captain Ramiz Raja told The Telegraph) had to retire on 53 owing to cramps, but the momentum wasnt lost.         
	The Indians were marginally ahead at the end of 10 overs, but by the 25th, the hosts were well in front  a passion-driven 165 for one vis-a-vis 153 for four.         
	MoM Younis Khan (unbeaten on 123), who hit his second hundred against India in a matter of three ODIs, anchored the chase beautifully and absolutely solid was Misbah (70 not out).         
	Just weeks ago, Younis, who is one of the finest players of spin, had registered an awesome 108 in the tri-series final in Dhaka.         
	As for Misbah, well, he has improved his chances of quickly taking over from the listless Malik. A winning debut will forever be special.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kaushik back after a decade 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kaushik back after a decade 
    - Dilip Tirkey dropped from list of World Cup probables           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: M. K. Kaushik on Wednesday was appointed the national hockey coach for two years by the ad hoc selection committee of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).         
	While Kaushik has been named the coach till the 2010 Asian Games in China, Harendra Singh and Ramandeep Singh will be his assistants. Kaushik returns as coach after a decade.         
	The selection committee, however, sprang a surprise when it dropped experienced defender Dilip Tirkey from the list of World Cup probables.         
	The exclusion of Tirkey from the list of probables came as a surprise as he had a good tournament in the recently concluded Muruguppa Gold Cup in Chennai.         
	Kaushik, when asked, said Tirkey still stands a good chance of coming back into the side. It is not the final list. Other players also have a chance of getting into the team on the basis of their performance in the domestic tournaments.         
	Tirkey, a former India captain, said he was disappointed by the decision of the selectors. But this is not the end of the world for me, he said. I will try my best to make a comeback.         
	Interestingly, the suspended Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), headed by K.P.S. Gill, held its Annual General Meeting in a city hotel on Wednesday. It was meant to be a test of strength but only a handful of members turned up.         
	The IHF secretary, K. Jyothikumaran, who was suspended by Gill a few months ago for allegedly accepting bribe for selecting a player in the national team, was also present.         
	According to insiders, only eight voting members  Haryana, Delhi , Jharkhand, Punjab, Chandigarh , Orissa, Himachal and Tamil Nadu  attended the AGM called by Gill.         
	Later in a press conference, Gill claimed that he had the support of most of the members. Todays AGM was attended by more or less 20 member associations. We discussed routine matters and decided to resume our activities, Gill said.         
	We will also see that elections are conducted at the earliest, once the Delhi High Court gives its verdict, he said.         
	The High Court is expected to hear Gills petition against the IOA challenging the dissolution on December 4.

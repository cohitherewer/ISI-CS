  - KNIGHT RIDERS AND ROYAL CHALLENGERS GEAR UP FOR A GRIM SURVIVAL BATTLE       Mind Games / John Buchanan                                
	We have played four successive matches for four losses. The last three being against Mumbai Indians at home, Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur and finally being beaten in a close finish to Kings XI Punjab in Chandigarh  certainly not what we wanted at this point of the season, nor I am sure the fans, sponsors and all our followers.         
	Throughout this period there have been some very encouraging individual performances. For instance, Debabrata Das on debut against Mumbai; Umar Guls penetration and steadiness; David Husseys allround performance in Mohali; Wriddhiman Popps Sahas keeping and batting exploits against Kings XI; Laxmi Ratan Shuklas rescue act on two occasions; some exceptional fast bowling from Ishant and Ashok Dindas continuing improvement.         
	There is little doubt that we have lost games up front  the first six overs which are crucial to the outcome of the match.         
	While poor batting or bowling performance at this stage does not mean the game is lost, it certainly means that the team which is behind at this stage has to play some very good catch up cricket to regain momentum.         
	As a consequence, our starts with ball and bat have been areas which have featured in our discussions in terms of the best way to play in this period of the game. And which players are best suited to providing Kolkata Knight Riders with the right launch pad for the remainder of the innings.         
	What has most pleased me even during our losses is how well every member is dealing with the hurt. There is no doubt that each one of us feels the pain of defeat. At the same time, from the dark clouds come the silver linings. I believe we are learning a lot about ourselves, a lot more about the 20-over game and about all the people within the franchise.         
	From this perspective, I could not be happier. We have a wonderful group of people right from the top. Shah Rukh Khan and throughout the whole Knight Riders team. While everyone wants to post the right results so that we can figure in the semi-finals at the end of May, there is great deal of patience and belief in what we are doing.         
	Part of building a successful franchise is that hopefully the majority of steps we take in the present will be the foundations for the future. I think we are taking huge strides at present even though results are not showing on the scoreboard. Such an atmosphere within the franchise is a critical element to building harmony, team spirit and in the long term, a culture of success.         
	IPL results in the recent games suggest the competition is beginning to take shape. With Deccans win over the Super Kings on Tuesday, Mumbais over Delhi, the Chennai Super Kings losing three games on the trot plus the ongoing successes of Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals, it appears that the Royals, the Kings XI and probably Delhi DareDevils are likely to occupy the top three positions.         
	That leaves a battle for the fourth spot between Chennai, Kolkata Knight Riders and Deccan. I think Mumbai and Bangalore are outsiders, yet both these teams are very capable of gaining plenty of upset wins.         
	Fourth position could be decided by net run rate so the various rates achieved will be an interesting sidelight of the next couple of weeks.         
	Kolkata Knight Riders have welcomed Shoaib this week. Shoaib is very keen to get his game up to speed so that he can make an impact on the competition.         
	With the various off field distractions that have occupied his life, he has had little time to do what he does best and that is to prepare to, and then, bowl rapidly.         
	While there is great temptation to rush a player of the impact abilities of Shoaib into a team that at the moment is not producing results, possible short-term gain will not drive our selection processes.         
	The franchise is developing a strong brand and a strong total team culture. To treat any player, no matter what their reputation or abilities, as a mere commodity in pursuit of victory will not be the culture of Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Shoaib needs the appropriate time to be ready. He knows that as well as we do  exactly how long that will take will be closely monitored by team physio, Andrew Leipus and team trainer, Adrian le Roux.         
	We have made one change to the squad that played in Mohali, with Tatenda Taibu replacing Mohammed Hafeez and we have added Aakash Chopra.

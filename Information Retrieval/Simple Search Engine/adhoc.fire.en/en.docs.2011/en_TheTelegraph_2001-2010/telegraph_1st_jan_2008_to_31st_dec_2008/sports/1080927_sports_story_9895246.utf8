	New Delhi: Saina Nehwal said she was immensely satisfied with the victory over world No. 6 Lin Zhu.         
	Any victory is important but this one has a special place, she said from Changzhou. I lost to Zhu in the Japan Super Series. So, I was eager to win this match. It was a very satisfying victory.         
	The match lasted for nearly an hour but according to the Hyderabad based shuttler, she should have wrapped it up by a straight game.         
	The second game, which Zhu won 23-21, was the longest. At one point of time, I was leading 20-18 but allowed her to make a comeback. If I managed to hold on, I would have won it easily, she said.         
	Saina, who reached the quarter finals of the Beijing Olympics, said she was happy with the way she played. My drop shots came good today throughout the match.

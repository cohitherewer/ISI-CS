The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poulter off to solid start
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Poulter off to solid start
                      
	Augusta: Britains Ian Poulter spectacularly aced the par-three 16th hole to vault into the early lead in the U.S. Masters first round on Thursday.         
	The Englishman holed out from 170 yards to get to three under overall in the opening major of the year, having earlier birdied the par-five second.         
	It was the 21st ace recorded at the Masters, and the first since South Africas Trevor Immelman holed out at the 16th in 2005.         
	Tournament favourite Tiger Woods, seeking his 14th major title, was level for the round after parring the first six holes.         
	The world number one, a four times champion at Augusta, was fortunate not to drop a shot on the opening hole where he benefited from a favourable bounce off the tee.         
	The 32-year-old American struck a tree with his drive at the par-four first. (Reuters)

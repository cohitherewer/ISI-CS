The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ministers comment surprises Ranatunga
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ministers comment surprises Ranatunga
    - I Dont see why elections have to be called, says SLC chairman           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ranatunga                                 
	Calcutta: The Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chairman, Arjuna Ranatunga, has expressed surprise that there would (possibly sooner rather than later) be elections to the body he has been heading since January 1.         
	The existing structure is of an interim kind, not unusual in Sri Lanka, where the power-hungry are often desperate to run SLC.         
	Its news to me The President (Mahinda Rajapaksa), who appointed me, hasnt communicated anything at all Only the President can order elections, Ranatunga, who is a Member of Parliament (and a former minister), told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Dubai, on Thursday evening, he added: I dont see why elections have to be called when weve got SLC back on track My team and I have worked very hard to get things in place, but if some want SLC to return to the days of corruption, then I have nothing to say         
	Among other things, my team and I have stopped certain people from robbing SLC and have also stopped some from doling out fancy sums It hasnt been easy, but I took charge with the brief of setting SLC in order.         
	On Wednesday, an agency report from Colombo quoted Sri Lankas sports minister, Gamini Lokuge, as saying: Work is under way to hold the elections.         
	Its no secret, however, that former SLC chairman Thilanga Sumathipala is more than just keen to make a comeback  something reported in these columns during the recent India-Sri Lanka Test series.         
	The straight-talking Ranatunga and Sumathipala, who is quite a controversial figure (pretty well-connected too), havent ever seen eye-to-eye.         
	Asked if he would contest, should elections actually be called, Ranatunga replied: You know me If Im not wanted, Ill leave SLC Im not going to ask people to vote for me (in a sports body) Ill be the chairman as long as the President wants me in the chair. Im absolutely clear on that count.         
	As always, theres no ambiguity in a position taken by Sri Lankas only World Cup-winning captain.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Jyoti Randhawa                           
	Calcutta: Jyoti Randhawa retained his DLF Masters crown edging out veteran Mukesh Kumar by one stroke at the DLF Golf amp; Country Club at Gurgaon on Sunday.         
	Randhawa shot a one-under 71 in round four to total eight-under 280 for the tournament. Mukesh produced a fabulous round of five-under 67 to finish one stroke behind Randhawa at seven under 281.         
	With this win, Randhawa also climbed to 10th on the PGTI order of merit. Mukesh is the current leader on the order of merit as a result of his second place finish.         
	Randhawa (72, 68, 69, 71) recorded his first win since the 2007 Indian Open thanks to a solid final round at his home course. He began poorly with a double bogey on the second where he landed his tee shot in the left rough. He soon recovered by sinking a birdie on the third.         
	The defending champion made another birdie on the ninth to make the turn at even par. He then made pars all the way till the 14th.         
	Randhawa, elated after his long-awaited win said: This win is of great significance for me because I have not been in the best of form recently. I think I was trying too hard to win in the early part of the tournament and thats why I was not at the top of my game. But today I felt great in the morning while practising and knew that a solid performance was round the corner.         
	Mukesh gave me a tough fight and I did get a little nervy towards the end. But all said and done I am glad that I came through. This win is a good return to form for me.         
	Mukesh Kumar (72, 72, 70, 67) ended a creditable second after shooting the days best round.         
	Ashok Kumar (72, 73, 70, 68) capped his week with a brilliant 68 to finish third at five-under 283. Ashok sank two eagles and four birdies while he dropped strokes with two bogeys and a double bogey.         
	Gaganjeet Bhullar (67, 72, 72, 75) and Shamim Khan (72, 70, 69, 75) were both tied fourth at two-under 286.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag relies only on skills
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sehwag relies only on skills
                      
	Bangalore: Virender Sehwag does not believe in astrology but rather relies on his own skills when it comes to ruling the 22 yards.         
	Fed up with suggestions and recommendations that he should wear jersey with specific numbers on it while playing, the flamboyant Indian opener went on to wear a numberless shirt in the fourth one-dayer against England on Sunday.         
	I dont believe in astrology but my family members do. Too many people used to call up and pester me and my family to use different numbers.         
	I was so fed up that I decided not to take any of their advice. We play Test matches without numbers and hence I dont use any number on my T-shirt, Sehwag, adjudged Man of the Match for his scintillating 69 in Bangalore, said.

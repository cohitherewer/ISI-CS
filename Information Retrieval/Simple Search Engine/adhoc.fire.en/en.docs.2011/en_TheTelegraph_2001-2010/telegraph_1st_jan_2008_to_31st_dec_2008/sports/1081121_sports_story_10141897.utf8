            A CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag in action on Thursday                           
	Kanpur: India overcame some tense moments and fading light before beating England by 16 runs via Duckworth-Lewis method to take a 3-0 lead in the seven-match ODI series here on Thursday.         
	In the first evenly contested match of the series, the hosts required 241 runs off a maximum of 49 overs after the start to the third ODI was delayed by 45 minutes due to hazy conditions.         
	India were 198 for five at the end of 40 overs, 16 runs ahead under the Duckworth-Lewis method, when poor light forced the players off the field. A wicket at that stage could have complicated things for India but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (29 not out) and Yusuf Pathan (12 not out) ensured there were no further hiccups.         
	The duo played without any risks and Dhoni, in particular, was in no mood to even try for quick singles as India were ahead due to a superior run-rate. The England players looked visibly unhappy with the abrupt end to the match and captain Kevin Pietersen had a long discussion with the umpires before leaving the field.         
	In the morning at the toss I said that Duckworth-Lewis would come into play, Dhoni said after the match. I had the sheet in my pocket when I went to bat.         
	The match in Kanpur saw the bowlers keep a leash on the scoring after two nightmarish outings in the earlier matches. Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh picked up the Man of the Match award, picking up three for 31 in 10 overs. He completed 200 wickets in ODIs in the process and picked up the wickets of Pietersen, Paul Collingwood and Owais Shah.         
	Virender Sehwag scored a responsible 68 as India lost Gautam Gambhir (14) and Suresh Raina (1) early, and were reduced to 34 for two. Rohit Sharma (28) failed to capitalise on a good start and edged off-spinner Graeme Swann to wicketkeeper Matt Prior. Yuvraj Singh contributed with another crucial 38 off 31 balls.         
	India decided to take the Power play in the 34th over of their innings after the mandatory change of the ball.         
	In the four Power Play overs (reduced by one over due to the revised playing conditions), India scored 38 runs and lost one wicket. It proved to be very crucial for the hosts as it took them comfortably ahead of the required run-rate.         
	Earlier, England changed their batting line-up under pressure. Ravi Bopara, sent in as opener, made a well-compiled 60.         
	Ishant Sharma replaced R.P. Singh and picked up a couple of wickets. He looked a bit erratic and had problems with no balls.         
	In a bizarre incident, curator Shiv Kumar had to wait outside the stadium till wee hours as he was denied entry by the security personnel.

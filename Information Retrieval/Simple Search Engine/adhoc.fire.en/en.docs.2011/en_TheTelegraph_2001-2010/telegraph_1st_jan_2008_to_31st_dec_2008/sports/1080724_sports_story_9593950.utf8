	ACA chief executive Paul Marsh on Wednesday said the security consultant hired by them as well as Reg Dickason and the consultants hired by the International Cricket Council had in their reports indicated there were a number of external threats in Pakistan.         
	There is a credible threat in all the major cities in Pakistan, including those which are hosting the event and they expect bombing in the coming week. So its what we are concerned about, Marsh told a news channel.         
	He said the job of the ACA and cricket australia was to ensure that they send players in a safe environment.         
	And we are not convinced of that in what we have seen in which is available to us here, he added.               
	Asif rsquo;s plan

	Training

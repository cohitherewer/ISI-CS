The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zondeki to replace Langeveldt
                                                   Zondeki to replace Langeveldt
                      
	Durban: Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Wednesday named fast bowler Monde Zondeki as Charl Langeveldts replacement in the national squad for the three-Test series against India starting on March 26 in Chennai.         
	Langeveldt pulled out after he was selected in place of fast bowler Andre Nel to fulfil CSAs requirement of at least six players of colour in the India-bound squad.         
	Langeveldt told CSA CEO Gerald Majola that he was not in the right frame of mind to play in India because of the controversy surrounding the dropping of Nel and his inclusion.         
	Zondeki, 25, is only the second black African to have been selected for the national squad after Makhaya Ntini. His selection fills the transformation quota.         
	He is the leading wicket-taker in South African first-class cricket this season with 62 dismissals at an average of 19.16 (PTI)

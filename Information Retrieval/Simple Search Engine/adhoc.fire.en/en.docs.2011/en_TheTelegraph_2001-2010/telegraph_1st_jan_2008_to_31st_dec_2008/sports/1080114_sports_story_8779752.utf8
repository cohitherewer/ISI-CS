                                                   Ian Chappell blames it on Aussie image

           
	London: Former Australian captain Ian Chappell has said that the allround criticism of Ricky Pontings teams abrasive behaviour during the acrimonious Sydney Test was only to be expected, considering their image as a team who intimidate the opponents. 
    
	Australia are aggrieved at always being portrayed as the on-field aggressors and the Harbhajan incident was the perfect opportunity for vindication: see, we said were not the only ones, Ian wrote in his newspaper column on Sunday. 
    
	The former Australia captain, however, feels that the current side are better behaved than the one led by predecessor Steve Waugh. 
    
	Ponting has addressed the behaviour of the Australian team since taking over the captaincy but some of the hypocrisy from Steve Waughs tenure lives on, he wrote. 
    
	Ian said Sydney-like incidents would occur again unless on-field umpires are given more powers. 
    
	If the administrators are firm but fair, the umpires are competent and in control and the captains set a good example, hypocrisy will be reduced and sportsmanship increased. 
    
	Tough Test cricket is batting, bowling and fielding well for five days, not making snide comments on the field and then getting angry when an opponent hits back either verbally or skilfully, Chappell said. 
    
	He also disapproved of the ICC system of captains to report opponents for racial comments. 
    
	Captains are now asked to dob in opponents for racial comments; who ever dreamed up that idea should be sacked on the spot. To ask Ponting, the captain of the team most opposing players acknowledge leads the way in on-field intimidation, to judge opponents behaviour is a blueprint for disaster.

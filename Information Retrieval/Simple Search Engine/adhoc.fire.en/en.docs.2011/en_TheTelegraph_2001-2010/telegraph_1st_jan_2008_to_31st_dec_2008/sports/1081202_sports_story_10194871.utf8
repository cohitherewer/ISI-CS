The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichung, Barreto still a class apart
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bhaichung, Barreto still a class apart
              FREE-KICK    P.K. BANERJEE                           Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto remain the main force behind the   club rsquo;s six consecutive victories     
	Two months ago, at the start of the I-League, I had predicted that the Calcutta teams would perform better this time. Though I am not fully satisfied with the showings of the city teams, it gives me immense pleasure to see that Mohun Bagan have climbed to the second spot in the league table after a disappointing start.         
	I watched a few of the Mohun Bagan matches on television and was convinced that Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto remain the main force behind the clubs back-to-back victories in six matches.        
	There is no doubt that both stars have their best years behind them. Yet they still have the ability to stretch any defence in the country. The other day I was simply delighted when Bhaichung struck that gem of a goal against Mahindra United.         
	I was sure that Bhaichung was not able to get a full view of the rival goal from the position he was in, yet he managed to bulge the net. It was his class and experience that made all the difference.        
	I was equally impressed by Barreto. He isnt a prolific scorer like he was five years ago, but his ability to play the correct passes in the middle can win a match.         
	He rarely sends a wrong pass and once he gets the ball, it becomes virtually impossible to snatch it from him.         
	His ball-covering is so good that one cannot take the ball away from him without committing a foul.        
	Karim Bencharifa, the Mohun Bagan coach, was right when he said that his first task was to ensure at least a second place by the end of the first leg. It will surely help him to launch an all-out attack when the league reopens in January.        
	East Bengal are lagging behind but they, too, have the ability to make a comeback. There are too many injuries in the team and once the players return to fitness, I am sure the red and yellow brigade will hit form in the second leg. One should not read too much into East Bengals consecutive defeats against JCT, Dempo and Churchill.        
	What makes me sad these days is the lack of talented local players in the Calcutta teams.         
	I dont want to mention names but some of the local midfielders are absolutely mediocre and do not have the ability to change the course of a match.        
	In the 70s and 80s, there were midfielders like Gautam Sarkar, Mohon Singh, Prasun Banerjee and Prasanta Banerjee, who used to be the backbones of their respective teams in the Maidan.        
	Then we had Basudeb Mondal and Tushar Rakshit, who were not as good as their predecessors but were still very skilful. The current lot of players are just too ordinary and lack mental toughness.        
	Sometimes I feel these present day players should have undergone a course on mental toughness under my friend Peter Thangaraj, who passed away a few days ago.        
	 I still remember how gallant he was under the bar in the 1962 Asian Games final against South Korea despite the fact that he had just recovered from flu. It was an amazing display of willpower to overcome all odds.         
	In the end, I must congratulate the United SC coach, Subrata Bhattacharya, for doing a decent job till now.         
	The other day his team were reduced to 10 men but still managed to beat Vasco convincingly. Subrata himself was a courageous footballer and has managed to generate the same spirit among his wards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India felt helpless: Irfan
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Team India felt helpless: Irfan
                      
	New Delhi: The Indian cricket team felt helpless and their frustration grew more and more after watching on television the worst-ever terror attack in Mumbai last week, disclosed paceer Irfan Pathan, who was filled with a cocktail of emotions including hurt and anger.         
	We were all very excited after our ODI win over England in Cuttack. We usually listen the interviews of the Man of the match and the others on TV so that we can pull their legs, but channels started flashing the terror attack and we were glued to our seats till the morning. Everyone was hurt, Pathan said, recalling the horror of 26/ll.         
	Entire India was angry and so was I for what happened there (in Mumbai). Whatever happened there was shameful. We asked ourselves why cant we do anything, our frustration grew bigger and bigger as we watched the action on TV, he said.         
	Pathan, who was here for a promotional, said the team was planning to do some charity for those who suffered in the tragedy. Asked if he had demanded extra safety cover, which a few of his teammates enjoy, he said it was now required by every Indian citizen.         
	Not only cricketers but the entire country needs special security at the moment, he said, and urged celebrities from all walks of life to co-operate with the security personnel at public places. We should leave our comfort zones and co-operate with the security agencies in places like this hotel (Taj Man Singh), because life is most important, Pathan said.         
	Pathan, when querried if being a Muslim, he felt scared to take the field in the backdrop of Mumbai terror attacks, he said: Religion has nothing to do with terrorism. No religion preaches killing or unrest. It (terrorism) is wrong. And no, I am not scared to take the field despite whatever happened.         
	On his views about the fate of sports in the subcontinent, Pathan felt human life was too precious to put at risk in volatile situations. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | UnhappyKevin Keegan resigns
                                                                                                                                                                                                     UnhappyKevin Keegan resigns
                      
	Newcastle: Kevin Keegan resigned Thursday as Newcastle manager after only seven months, quitting the Premier League club for a second time.         
	After a week of talks with the clubs board, Keegan released a statement saying he had been left with no choice but to leave.         
	Keegan had been retired from coaching at the professional level until the Magpies persuaded him to return last January. But he grew frustrated at his lack of influence over transfers, losing James Milner to Aston Villa last week and failing to secure several other targets.         
	The appointment of Dennis Wise as director of football was seen as undermining Keegans power.         
	Ive been working desperately hard to find a way forward with the directors, but sadly that has not proved possible, Keegan said. Its my opinion that a manager must have the right to manage and that clubs should not impose upon any manager that he does not want.

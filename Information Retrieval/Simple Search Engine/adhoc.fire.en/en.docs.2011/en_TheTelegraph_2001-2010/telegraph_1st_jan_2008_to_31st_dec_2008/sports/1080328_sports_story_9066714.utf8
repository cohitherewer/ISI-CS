The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coach, IHF in bitter battle
                                                     Coach, IHF in bitter battle
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Joaquim Carvalho                           
	New Delhi: At a time when the nation is still mourning Indias first ever failure to qualify for the Olympic Games, Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) officials, it seems, are yet to learn their lessons.         
	According to highly placed sources, IHF officials are now involved in a bitter battle with national coach Joaquim Carvalho over the induction of two players in the list of probables for the national camp, beginning in Bangalore next Monday.         
	While Carvalho has already submitted a list of 39 probables  excluding Arjun Halappa and drag-flicker Sandeep Singh  IHF secretary K Jyothikumaran has included both in the list.         
	The camp was set to begin today (Friday) but had to be postponed till Monday because of this dispute, disclosed the source.         
	The IHF secretary has inducted five players in the list without consulting any one. It has infuriated the coach. That is one of the reasons why the IHF is yet to announce the names of the probables for the national camp.         
	Carvalho was severely criticised by former Olympians for ignoring Halappa and Sandeep from the squad that lost to Great Britain in the Santiago qualifiers. But the coach is believed to have managed to convince IHF president KPS Gill that both these players should be ignored for the four-nation meet in Australia and the Azlan Shah tournament in Kuala Lumpur.         
	When asked whether he has once again dropped Halappa and Sandeep Singh, Carvalho said the official list should be released by the federation.         
	But, then, my emphasis is on youngsters. I dont want to take players who have received enough chances but have failed to deliver. I am looking forward to watch some inspiring performance from youngsters like Sameer Buxla, Diwakar Ram, Pramod Kumar or Damandeep Singh.         
	According to IHF sources, Carvalho is not on talking terms with Jyothikumaran and is upset with the way the secretary is pushing players from his home state like V. Raja or Senthil.         
	Jyothikumaran, who refused to comment on the issue, is keen to bring in Ric Charlesworth in place of Carvalho. During the IHF meeting last week, he lobbied hard for the removal of the Mumbai-based coach but was vetoed by Gill.

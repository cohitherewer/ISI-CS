The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods still has a grand vision
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Woods still has a grand vision
            THOMAS BONK                      
	Augusta: He wore all black, including a black cap, but Tiger Woods also wore a sunny disposition on Tuesday at Augusta National Golf Club, and it seemed to fit him well.         
	Countdown to the 72nd Masters has begun in earnest, and Thursdays first round probably cant come soon enough for Woods. Hes already tapering off his pre-tournament work.         
	Woods limited his practice round to nine holes and was done well before noon. His plan for Wednesday didnt even include looking at the course, so Woods restricted his work to the driving range.         
	As far as preparations go, Woods seems to have had his fill, and he wont have long to wait to see if hes going to be able to live up to his words.         
	Remember? Winning all four majors this year is well within reason.         
	Thats what Woods said a couple of months ago. Thats what Woods reiterated in a lively question-and-answer session on Tuesday.         
	Woods got handed the big question early, whether anything has happened so far to dissuade him from his opinion. No, he answered without hesitation. I mean, the reason why I said that, you have to understand why I said that  because Ive done it before. Ive won all four in a row.         
	In 2000, Woods won the US Open at Pebble Beach, the British Open at St Andrews and the PGA Championship at Valhalla, then won the 2001 Masters to hold all four major championship titles at the same time.         
	Majority of my career... nine of those years Ive won five or more tournaments, so just got to win the right four. Thats what it boils down to.         
	Phil Mickelson said that he agreed with Woods, that winning all four majors in one year is possible.         
	Its going to be a tough feat, he said on Tuesday. Its certainly a possibility. And he has already won four majors in a row, so its not an impossible feat. Its been done by Bobby Jones a long time ago, certainly not with the professional majors. But I think its doable. I just dont know what the odds will be.         
	Drawing a line that connects Woods to major championships is a popular exercise on the PGA Tour, mainly because he has made it such a straight one. When Woods successfully defended his PGA Championship last year at Southern Hills, his collection of major titles reached 13, five less than Jack Nicklauss record of 18.         
	Woods is widely regarded as having a better chance of surpassing Nicklauss total than winning all four majors in one year. But Zach Johnson, the defending Masters champion, says Woods is a unique player, easily capable of the unexpected, or even blurring the line of whats seen as impossible.         
	He says he can get better, which is absolutely scary, Johnson said on Tuesday. I mean, I know I can. Its encouraging. Makes you want to work harder. Hes a freak, in a good way. Hes won every major and won every major multiple times. So I think everybody would probably agree that it seems like his form, middle to the end of last year and certainly the beginning of this year, you can kind of compare it to 2001, that time period, and that was scary. So hes still as scary as ever.         
	Moist and cool conditions have not only made the course play longer than its 7,445 yards because the ball doesnt roll on the fairway, but the greens have been softened. Woods doesnt expect them to remain that way.         
	Woods, who will play the first two rounds with US Open champion Angel Cabrera and Stuart Appleby, says being successful on the greens is essential. You cant putt poorly here and win, he said.         
	Now, you have to drive the ball well in order to win here. Before, you could spray it all over the place and it didnt matter. Its playing a lot more penal off the tee, but the greens are still the same. The greens are still just as penal.         
	The verdict on just how penalty-laden they actually play is now only a day away.                 LAT-WP NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Krejza in the reckoning: Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Krejza in the reckoning: Ponting
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Ricky Ponting at nets on Tuesday. (AFP)                           
	New Delhi: Australian captain Ricky Ponting hinted on Tuesday that off spinner Jason Krejza may make his debut in the third Test beginning at the Kotla on Wednesday.         
	Jason is definitely in the reckoning. I think the wicket is little bit loose on the surface at the moment, though it looks a pretty good batting track now. It would probably start loosening even more.         
	Spin is definitely an option for us. There is option of playing both and there is option of playing one, Ponting said speaking after the training session.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Will the absence of Harbhajan be an advantage?         
	In Mohali, Mishra did a pretty good job, taking seven wickets in the game. Yes, Harbhajan has a good record against Australia and hes a very good bowler. I believe he has got a sore toe at the moment.         
	Look, we will be ready for any team they produce on the day. We already have spoken and looked at Mishra last time and we know Anil Kumble very, very well and know its not going to be easy against them.         
	Did Bishan Singh Bedis visit to the nets help you?         
	I have no clue how he came around. I was training and Bishan was there. I think he spoke to Jason and lot of positive stuff came out of it. Bishan had to say some good things about Jason after the session and it must be good for his confidence. All in all, I think it was a worthwhile experience and it might happen again in some stage.         
	Is there any panic in the Australian dressing room after losing the Mohali Test?         
	I dont think so. We have been looking around to invite some people to come along and have a look. Greg was the assistant coach in the first two Tests, Steve Waugh just happened to be here for some MCC things happening and as I said, I dont know how Bedi actually ended up there!         
	On Australian preparations         
	We have prepared well for this match. It has been a good experience till now but no one like to loose. But you have to learn from the defeat. Over the last week we have spent considerable time in thinking what we need to do. I know the mistakes I have made as a player so far and am also aware of the errors on part of some the other guys. The true test is that we dont make those mistakes again.         
	On reverse swing         
	When the ball started reverse swinging, the Indian bowlers put it in the right areas and troubled our batsmen.         
	I think that is the area where the Indians have scored over us. Our bowlers have been a bit off the line with the reverse swinging ball and we have paid the price for that.

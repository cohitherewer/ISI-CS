                                                                                                                                                                                                     Relaxed Sourav focused on match
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: A day after making the dramatic announcement, Sourav Ganguly strode into the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Wednesday morning, seemingly oblivious to the huge media attention his arrival evoked. It seemed just another day and that the significance and enormity of the decision had already sunk in.         
	Sourav has some pleasant memories of this ground  the last time he batted here, he scored 330 in the two innings against Pakistan.         
	He was the first to have a close look at the wicket before being joined by captain Anil Kumble and Sachin Tendulkar. By then it was time for some practice. Sourav batted indoors in front of the bowling machine for quite a while before going to the nets. He was all grace, never for a moment bothered by pace or spin. In between, there was also some fielding practice with Robin Singh.         
	I feel relaxed I slept well last night and there are no regrets. I just felt it was time to go, he said.         
	The thought of being under constant scrutiny has no doubt led to the retirement. But has he ever thought why he is always singled out? Probably, the concerned people dont like my face, he quipped.         
	Sourav does not think that the pressure of having to do well in this series has increased with his decision. Obviously I will try and do well. The pressure of doing well will always be there and that probably brings the best out of everyone. I cannot say whether it is a relief or not All I can say is I have not been sad, he said. I am going to approach the series in the same way that has made me successful in the past.         
	What has been the reaction of his family? Nothing. My father will always be sad as usual. He also needs to understand that I need to go. I know the situation better than anyone else, he said.         
	Souravs decision has now led to the question as to who will call it a day next. Anil Kumble, on Wednesday, said he would announce it when the time comes.         
	I will let you know when my last series is I am not someone who would like to announce it beforehand         
	Lets stop talking about this. Let the players decide when they need to go, the Indian captain said.         
	The next four weeks could prove to be critical for Indian cricket.

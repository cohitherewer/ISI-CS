                  Preity Zinta during the players auction in Mumbai                     
	New Delhi: Bollywood actor Preity Zinta, who owns the Mohali team in the Indian Premier League, is disappointed at not being able to rope in Harbhajan Singh but is confident that they will win the inaugural edition of the tournament.         
	She said they were keen to have Harbhajan in the team.         
	We missed Harbhajan. We tried hard (to win him) but Mumbai wanted them. We wanted to have him in the team, Zinta told a TV channel.         
	On her teams chances in the tournament she said, Absolutely...Absolutely Mohali is going to win.         
	Zinta is comfortable with the on-field antics of temperamental speedster Sreesanth, who has earned a reputation of being over aggressive.         
	We love Sreesanth for who he is. He is an important part of the team. I dont mind if he screams, dances on one leg. I have no problem as long as he performs, she said.         
	Zinta said she was not a die-hard cricket fan but a sports enthusiast. I was always a sports enthusiast. I used to watch only one-days and that too finals. India-Pakistan matches I love to watch. I am not only a cricket fan but (I am) a sports enthusiast, she said. (PTI)

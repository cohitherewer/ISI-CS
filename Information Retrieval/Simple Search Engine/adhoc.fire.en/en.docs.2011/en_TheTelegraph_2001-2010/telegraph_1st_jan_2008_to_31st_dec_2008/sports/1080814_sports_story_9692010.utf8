	Beijing: It will be a real treat for tennis lovers on Thursday as Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi take on Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarter finals of mens doubles.         
	The seventh-seeded Indians eased into the last-eight stage on Wednesday, beating Marcelo Melo and Andre Sa of Brazil 6-4, 6-2 in just over an hour.         
	Federer and Wawrinka got the better of Dmitry Tursunov and Mikhail Youzhny 6-4, 6-3.         
	In a late second-round womens doubles match, a half-fit Sania Mirza and rookie Sunitha Rao tried their best but could not avert a defeat against the top-seeded pair, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Dinara Safina. The Russians won 6-4, 6-4.         
	Breaking Sa early in the third game, Paes and Bhupathi went ahead and subsequently did not relax their grip. They took the first set without much ado.         
	The Indian veterans broke Melo in the first game of the second set. In the seventh game, a couple of double faults by Sa handed them a brilliant chance to take the match away from the Brazilians and they did just that, courtesy a Bhupathi winner.         
	Bhupathi then served out the set and match to keep the Indian Express on track.         
	Like yesterday, we played well again today, said Paes, this helps build confidence for the later matches. When we are so sharp and confident as we have been in the first and second rounds, we would be tough to beat.         
	Were they prepared for the opponents they had to face on Wednesday?         
	It was quite late when we found out who would be our opponents Around 10pm on Tuesday. After the match we have to go for stretching, massage and then rejuvenate ourselves a bit. Hesh (Mahesh) does things his own way while I do mine.         
	We dont hang out together all the time. What is important is that we deliver on court.         
	No, we havent played against the duo as a doubles team, though I have played Sa twice in singles and once in a doubles match before and lost all of them, Paes grinned.         
	So now are they quits? Oh no, we are 3-1 now, Paes laughed again         
	If we play the way we are doing now, with a high level of energy and professionalism, we are ready to take on anybody.         
	Sania and Sunitha put up a valiant fight before bowing out. The world No.65, battling a dodgy wrist that forced her to retire in the first round singles match, and Sunitha, with a heavily-strapped right thigh, broke the Russians to go 3-0 up in the first set.         
	However, Kuznetsova and Safina hit back to eventually seal the set in 43 minutes.         
	The Indians broke Safina in the third game to go 2-1 up but the Russians broke Sunitha in the fourth game. They eventually sealed the nearly one-and-half hour battle.

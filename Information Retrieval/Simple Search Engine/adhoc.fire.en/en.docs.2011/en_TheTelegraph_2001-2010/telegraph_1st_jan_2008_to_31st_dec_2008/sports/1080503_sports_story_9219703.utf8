The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wright sees a positive in slapgate
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wright sees a positive in slapgate
                      
	Mumbai: Former Team India coach John Wright has looked at the brighter side of the Harbhajan Singh-Sreesanth spat and feels that while it cannot be condoned, it also shows the passion with which both play the game.         
	What happened between Harbhajan and Sreesanth is what sometimes happens when the enthusiasm and energy gets misdirected, Wright told a website on Friday.         
	Id rather let my players have that sense of passion even if it meant it sometimes overflowed in controversy. Its hard to teach someone how to feel totally committed, he said.         
	Yes, Harbhajan and Sreesanth may need to be told a few things but their intent is admirable. Neither will take a backseat and both are fuelled by an innate sense of competitiveness, he said.         
	Okay, there may be times when that becomes a bit of a problem for management but its a tremendous sign for the Indian cricket team, added the former Black Caps captain and opener.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dementieva in quarters, Jankovic closer to No. 1
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dementieva in quarters, Jankovic closer to No. 1
                      
	Tokyo: Beijing Olympic gold medallist Elena Dementieva earned a berth in the lucrative season-ending championships Thursday as Jelena Jankovic took another step towards becoming world No.1.         
	Dementieva, the third seed who won the Pan Pacific Open here in 2006, overwhelmed Alize Cornet 6-0, 6-3 to book a place in the quarter finals.         
	The Russian, who received a first-round bye, took the first 10 games in a row for a runaway victory over the 18th-ranked Frenchwoman in just 69 minutes.         
	With the win, she joined Jankovic, Serena Williams, Dinara Safina and Ana Ivanovic in qualifying for the elite $4.45 million Sony Ericsson Championships in Doha, Qatar from November 4-9.         
	This is great that Im going to be there, because this year I was fighting to get into the tournament. Its very nice, Im very excited about Doha, said Dementieva, ranked fourth in the world.         
	First of all, its great to have a chance to play there, because at the end of the year, this is the biggest event, she said.         
	With the stadiums roof closed due to rain in the morning, Dementieva got off to a perfect start and Cornet had to wait for the Russians backhand error at 40-15 to take her first game in the 11th game of the second set.         
	The 18-year-old Cornet took three straight games, but it was too late to get back into the match.         
	At the end of the match, she (Cornet) had nothing to lose and she started to play very aggressive. We had a good fight, said Dementieva.         
	Maybe I lost my concentration a little bit, because I won 10 games in a row. Its never easy, because I was always trying to make a winner.         
	In the quarter finals, Dementieva will take on either Francesca Schiavone of Italy or Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians go up 1-0
                                                   Indians go up 1-0
                      
	Sydney: Sachin Tendulkar cracked his first one-day century in Australia as an inspired India spanked the world champions by six wickets in the first of the best-of-three tri-series finals at the SCG on Sunday.         
	After the Indian bowlers had put up a disciplined performance to restrict Australia to 239 for eight, Tendulkar (117 not out) batted like a true champion to notch up his 42nd ODI century to steer India home with 25 balls to spare.         
	The 34-year-old master blaster, who has not been in the best of forms in the tri-series, could not have found a better time to make a statement with his bat, breaking the jinx of not having an ODI century on Australian soil in the process.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit the winning runs by clobbering a boundary to trigger off scenes of wild celebration among Indian fans in the galleries.         
	Indias gamble to go in with two spinners paid off as both Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla bowled tidy spells to contain the run flow with only Matthew Hayden and (82), Michael Hussey (45) and Andrew Symonds (31) being the notable scorers.         
	The pressure will be on the home team when the two teams square up for the second finals at Brisbane on Tuesday.         
	Tendulkar provided the thrust from the very start as laying a strong foundation with a 50-run partnership for the opening wicket with Robin Uthappa (17). and then stitching the valuable partnership with rohit sharma which tilted the scales in visitors favour.         
	The master batsman reached the century with a dab to third man, hitting eight boundaries facing 106 deliveries. India had suffered a usual stutter losing three wickets of Uthappa, Gautam Gambhir (3) and Yuvraj Singh (10) in quick succession.         
	Uthappa had done his bit in providing India with a decent platform before he pulled James Hopes straight into the hands of Mike Hussey who took a brilliant diving catch on the run at the square leg fence.         
	Gambhir was a victim of misunderstanding when he hesitated momentarily on a call for second run from Tendulkar and found himself short of crease at the non-strikers end.

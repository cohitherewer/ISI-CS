The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chennai win, send Mumbai packing
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chennai win, send Mumbai packing
                      
	Hyderabad: Chennai Super Kings grabbed the last available semi-final spot in the Indian Premier League after beating Deccan Chargers by seven wickets in their last league match on Tuesday.         
	Chasing 148 to win, the visitors overhauled the modest target with four balls to spare, thanks to sensible batting by Suresh Raina (54 not out) and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (37).         
	The Chennai team not only sealed a semi-final place for themselves but also broke the heart of Sachin Tendulkar-led Mumbai Indians team, who are now out of the tournament.         
	A Chennai loss on Tuesday and a Mumbai win on Wednesday against Bangalore Royal Challengers would have enabled Mumbai to enter the last-four stage of the tournament.         
	Now, Mumbais last league match has been rendered inconsequential.         
	Dhoni played some blistering shots in his 25-ball knock which included four fours and one six and shared a crucial 55-run stand with Raina for the third wicket.         
	Skippers fall brought Albie Morkel on the crease and he together with Raina saw their team home, though some tight bowling at death made the encounter interesting.         
	Pragyan Ojha had Dhoni caught in the deep by Gibbs and that put brakes on the run-flow.         
	Chennai required 17 runs off the last two overs. R.P. Singh bowled the penultimate over, which fetched the visitors 10 runs.         
	Raina hit Vijaykumar for a six on the second ball of the last over to seal the victory for his team and also brought up his half-century.         
	Raina consumed 43-balls for his brilliant 54-run innings, adorned with five boundaries and two shots over the fence.         
	P Vijay Kumar drew first blood when he dismissed former Black Caps skipper Stephen Fleming (14) but the hosts could not build on the early success as Parthiv Patel and Suresh Raina did not give them any chance.         
	Fleming went for an extravagant shot outside the off- stump but ended up with an edge to Adam Gilchrist behind the wickets.         
	Raina played some elegant shots on the off-side and together with Patel put up 34-runs for the second wicket before the Gujarati batsman walked back.         
	Patel hit straight to Shahid Afridi at covers to become the victim of P Sravesh Kumar.           (PTI)

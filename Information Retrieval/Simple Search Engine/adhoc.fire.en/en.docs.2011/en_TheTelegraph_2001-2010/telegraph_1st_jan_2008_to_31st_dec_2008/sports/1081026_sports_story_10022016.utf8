The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Baggy Green makes Benaud scratch head
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Baggy Green makes Benaud scratch head
                      
	Melbourne: A Baggy Green cap said to have belonged to Richie Benaud is expected to fetch Australian $25,000 in an auction here but the former Australian cricket captain says he has no idea whether the piece of memorabilia was ever owned by him.         
	I dont have any Baggy Greens, never have had, Benaud told a local daily when asked about the auction on November 5.         
	An auction house here claims that the cap was worn by Benaud during a tour of South Africa in 1957-58.         
	Benaud said he has no clue as to whether the cap is authentic. (PTI)

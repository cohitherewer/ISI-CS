The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yousuf for ICL, PCB shocked
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yousuf for ICL, PCB shocked
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan cricket authorities were shocked as prolific batsman Mohammed Yousuf Monday left for New Delhi to play in the Indian Cricket League (ICL), jeopardising his international career even as he was named in the national squad for the series against the West Indies.         
	Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials confirmed they have learnt from Yousufs wife that he would be playing in the ICL, dealing a severe blow to the national team which has witnessed a series of defections to ICL in the recent years.         
	He didnt tell us anything about his plans. His leaving like this for India and confirmation he is going to play in the ICL has come as a shock to us, PCBs director, cricket operations, Zakir Khan said.         
	Newly-appointed Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam said Yousufs sudden departure was hard to explain as he never got a chance to interact with him.         
	Until we get an official confirmation from Yousuf himself we cant say much. But if he has joined the ICL then he would be banned from all cricket in Pakistan, Zakir said.         
	Travelling to India on the same flight with Yousuf was PCB director general Saleem Altaf, but even he had no inkling of the batsmans plans.         
	I asked him where he is going. He just told me he is going to India on a private visit and would return after two days, said Altaf, who was travelling to New Delhi to attend a World Cup meeting.

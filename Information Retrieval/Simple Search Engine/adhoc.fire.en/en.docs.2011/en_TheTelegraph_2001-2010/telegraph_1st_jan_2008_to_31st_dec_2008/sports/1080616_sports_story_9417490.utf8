The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Austrians look for a miracle 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Austrians look for a miracle 
                      
	Tenero: Euro 2008 co-hosts Austria will invoke the spirit of Cordoba against Germany on Monday and the prize this time could be more than just a sense of schadenfreude.         
	At the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, an Austrian team with no chance of qualification beat West Germany 3-2 to take the reigning champions out of the tournament with them.         
	Thirty years on from that great upset, Austria have a chance to go one better.         
	A point would be enough for Germany to go through as group B runners-up behind Croatia but victory for Austria could take them into the last eight at the expense of their old rivals, provided Poland do not beat Croatia by a bigger margin.         
	A 50,000 crowd will give the Austrians fervent backing in the capital but the cold reality is that Germany, despite their 1-2 defeat to Croatia, remain overwhelming favourites.         
	That was acknowledged by Austria coach Josef Hickersberger, who played in that famous win in Cordoba  Austrias only victory over Germany at a major tournament.         
	Germanys goal will be to reproduce the sharp counter-attacking football that took them to a 2-0 win over Poland in their first match.         
	Germany are always under pressure. Its exceptionally high for this game but our team spirit is good.         
	Germany, three times European champions, will be without Bastian Schweinsteiger after his red card against Croatia, and probably full-back Marcell Jansen, who has a shoulder injury.         
	Lukas Podolski, scorer of all three German goals so far, has overcome an ankle injury and will play.           (REUTERS)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkars return to competitive cricket looks set to be delayed as the senior-most pro may now, in what will be a change of plan, not play the September 24-28 Irani Trophy in Vadodara.         
	Hes been named in the Rest squad, led by Anil Kumble, to take on Ranji Trophy champions Delhi.         
	Sachin hurt his left elbow during the last Test in Sri Lanka, at the P. Sara Stadium, some five weeks ago, and seems to require more rest.         
	The injury made him miss the five-match ODI series there.         
	A formal announcement is expected within a day With such a big series (against Australia) coming up, its better to be safe than sorry, a top source told The Telegraph late on Friday.         
	The first of four Tests versus Ricky Pontings men begins in Bangalore on October 9.         
	Sachin is, of course, less than 100 runs away from Brian Laras (Test) world record of 11,953. Incidentally, the Mumbaikar is within two months of completing 19 years at the highest level.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Russia hit by player absences
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Russia hit by player absences
          
	Neustift (Austria): Russias chances of upsetting highly-fancied Spain in their Euro 2008 opener on Tuesday will be undermined by the absence of playmaker Andrei Arshavin and striker Pavel Pogrebnyak.         
	Arshavin is suspended while Pogrebnyak has been ruled out of the tournament with a knee injury.         
	Spain, on a 16-match unbeaten run, are favourites to win the group D tie in Innsbruck but Andres Iniesta said the Russian setbacks would make little difference to his team.         
	I dont think we should change our tactics because of what has happened, the midfielder told a news conference.         
	Spain topped their qualifying group before notching morale-boosting wins over world champions Italy and France in their Euro 2008 build-up.         
	But despite having Fernando Torres, David Villa and Primera Liga top scorer Dani Guiza in their ranks, goals have been hard to come by with Spain scoring more than once in only one of their last five matches.         
	To rectify the situation coach Luis Aragones appears to have decided to play Torres and Villa up front rather than a lone striker.         
	The two-man attack is likely to mean no place for Cesc Fabregas in midfield while Marcos Senna is favoured to get the nod over Xabi Alonso as the holding player.         
	Russia coach Guus Hiddink refused to get too downcast about the loss of Arshavin and Pogrebnyak.         
	I cant complain and start crying, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag predicts 3-1 win for India
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sehwag predicts 3-1 win for India
                      
	New Delhi: Swashbuckling opener Virender Sehwag on Monday forecast a 3-1 result in favour of India against Australia in the upcoming four-Test series, if the series was played on spin-friendly tracks.         
	If we are playing on spin friendly tracks, the series might be in our favour 3-1, Sehwag told a TV channel on Monday.         
	The Indian team is the only team that beat Australia in Australia twice. We beat them in Perth last time and before that in Adelaide. So, we are accepting the challenge and we will fight it out. Hopefully we will do well and reclaim the Border Gavaskar trophy, he added.         
	Sehwag, said he was clear about his job which is to give a good start to the team and then convert it into a big advantage. I am in good nick but I am looking forward to this series and hope I will do well because its against the Aussies and everybody knows its a tough task to get runs against them, he added.         
	The Delhi player, however, made light of the fact that Ricky Pontings men struggled in the drawn four-day warm-up match which concluded in Hyderabad on Sunday.         
	In a practice game, you are not 100 per cent on and you are just practising for the Test match and are not worried about the result. I think they got what they wanted out of the game. They are ready for the Tests, he said.         
	Sourav Ganguly too has cautioned his teammates not to be fooled by Australias performance in the warm-up match and said they would surely come hard at us in the Tests.         
	Just dont go by what they do in the (practice) match. Tests and practice matches are completely different, Ganguly said.         
	These were the same bowlers  (Brett) Lee, Mitchell Johnson and Stuart Clark  who made things tough for us in Australia. It wont be any different when the Test matches start and Im sure theyll come very hard at us, he was quoted as saying by The Courier Mail.         
	Australia managed to draw their only practice match on the tour with Mike Hussey (126) and captain Ricky Ponting (58 not out) impressing against the Board Presidents XI.

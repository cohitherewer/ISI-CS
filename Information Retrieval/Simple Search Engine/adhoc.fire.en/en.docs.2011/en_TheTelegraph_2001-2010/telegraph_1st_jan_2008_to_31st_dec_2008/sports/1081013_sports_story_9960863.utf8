The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | White could take India by surprise, says Chandra
                                                                                                                                                                                                       White could take India by surprise, says Chandra
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR              Chandrasekhar                      
	Bangalore: Bhagwat Chandrasekhar feels debutant leggie Cameron White could turn out to be the surprise package for India on the final day of the opening Test. Australia are already ahead by 263 runs, and White could put India under pressure on a deteriorating pitch.         
	Whatever little Ive seen of White suggests that he could surprise India. He seems interesting with his fast leg breaks. Something in him makes me feel that he could click,Chandrasekhar told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	When on song White could be very dangerous. I dont know how the Australians are going to utilise him, but he could pose some problems in these conditions. Hes just got to be disciplined and be on the spot, the city-based legendary leg-spinner said.         
	White apart, Chandrasekhar hasnt been impressed by the visiting attack. Its tough to replace a Shane Warne or a Glenn McGrath. They will surely suffer on this tour... No bowler has so far shown the ability to run through the side. And you need it to win Test matches, he said.         
	Chandrasekhar thinks Anil Kumble still has it in him to deliver. There has been lot of talk in the media about Anils retirement but I believe hes still a match-winner. I know age also counts, but he still has the potential.         
	Its hard to find a replacement. A Piyush Chawla or a Amit Mishra may be promising but they need to mature and fine-tune their bowling. Anils obviously having some problems, given the lean phase, but he has to sort it out.         
	It happens sometimes in a long career I went through a similar phase once in my career. Its difficult to pinpoint any particular reason for it, he explained.         
	Harbhajan Singh, too, hasnt been successful recently. Has he noticed any flaw in his action? Its again very difficult to say He obviously has his own plans, but I would suggest that he should flight the ball a little more. Hes been bowling too flat Giving more flight would mean being more attacking and opening up a few chances.         
	Chandrasekhar doesnt agree that India should have played three spinners in this Test. We should play to our strengths. When we have quality pacers, then whats the harm in playing them. When spin was our strength and we didnt have pacers, we concentrated on spin         
	He is not ready to bet on Indias chances on the final day. Making predictions is very difficult. The wicket isnt doing much except for turning at times. Given the current position, I would say Australia are slightly ahead, though a draw is more on the cards.

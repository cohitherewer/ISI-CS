The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Malik seeks ICC help
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Malik seeks ICC help

	Karachi: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik on Wednesday urged the International Cricket Council (ICC) to intervene and convince the member countries for home and away series against his country to stop it from becoming an isolated cricket nation.         
	If teams dont tour Pakistan and if we dont get a home series then the sport will suffer in Pakistan and people will lose interest in it eventually, Malik said.         
	I think the ICC cannot allow this situation to get out of hand. Being the governing body it needs to influence on member countries to compensate for the postponed events this year, he added.         
	Malik, Kamran Akmal, Rao Iftikhar, Sohail Tanvir left this morning from Karachi for South Africa to participate in the shooting of an Indian film, Victory, in which other leading cricketers of the world have also featured in bits and pieces.         
	Malik told reporters that he was disappointed and depressed at the lack of international exposure for Pakistan.                     
	It is very frustrating for the players the way two important events have been postponed this year. It is so depressing that despite being a major cricket playing nation we will not be able to play a Test match this year, he said.         
	Australia postponed their Test tour in March and then the ICC deferred the eight-nation Champions Trophy due to security concerns of South Africa, England, Australia and New Zealand.         
	To make matters worse Pakistans effort to organise an alternate series to replace the postponed Champions Trophy have also failed.         
	South Africa turned down a proposal to host Pakistan and Sri Lanka in a tri-series this month, while a planned one-day series in Sri Lanka has also run into problems.         
	Pakistan played their last Test against India in December and their next series is not scheduled until January when India tours Pakistan.         
	Meanwhile, Ehsan Mani, former president of the ICC, has advised the Pakistan Cricket Board to surrender the hosting rights of the Champions Trophy to avoid financial losses.         
	Pakistan need to be more smart in the existing circumstances and not insist on hosting the tournament. It should have and can still allow it to be shifted to some other venue instead of facing financial losses, he told a TV channel here.

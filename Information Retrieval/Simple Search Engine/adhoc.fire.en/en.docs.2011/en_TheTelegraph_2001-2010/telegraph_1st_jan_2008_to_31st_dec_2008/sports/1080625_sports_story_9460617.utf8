                                                                                                                                                                                                     EURO DIARY
                      
	Austria coach quits  
	Vienna: Josef Hickersberger quit as Austria coach because his team failed to reach the quarter finals. The Euro 2008 co-hosts were eliminated in the group stage after losing 0-1 to both Croatia and Germany and drawing 1-1 with Poland. We played very well, even sensationally some of the time, but we didnt reach the quarter finals and didnt accomplish our common goal, Hickersberger said on Tuesday. Im sorry and Ive drawn the consequences from it.   
	Chivu surgery         
	Bucharest: Romania captain Cristian Chivu has undergone shoulder surgery to fix an injury that affected his form at the European Championship. The operation took place in the Italian town of Pavia south of Milan on Monday and lasted two hours, a Romanian daily reported on Tuesday.         
	Hiddinks wish         
	Basel: Russia coach Guus Hiddink would have preferred his young, attacking team play world champions Italy in the semi-finals instead of Spain. I watched (the Spain-Italy quarter final) and you think, Id really like the Italians because tactically you can work against them. It is a team where lots of people stay in one place behind the ball, but that leaves space elsewhere where you can play, he said.

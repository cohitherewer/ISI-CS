The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahela blames it on inconsistency
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mahela blames it on inconsistency
                      
	Colombo: If India have already pocketed the one-day series with one match to spare, it is because of the inconsistency plaguing the Sri Lankan batting, according to Mahela Jayawardene.         
	India sealed the fate of the series with their 46-run win on Wednesday.         
	Im disappointed with the way we played. We had our opportunities but we have not been consistent. Especially with the bat, the Lankan skipper rued. If you are not capable of getting the runs, it is quite difficult to win matches.         
	We just need to make sure that our batting is consistent. In one-day cricket, it is important that you be very consistent with the bat. That is where I think we lost the series, he added.         
	Jayawardene said the opening pair remains a headache and it would probably take some time before they find a solution.         
	Like I said, we have not been consistent. I think we had Upul (Tharanga) partnering Sanath (Jayasuriya) for quite some time. Upul had a bit of a slump in the last eight months and is now with the A team in South Africa.         
	We need a bit of time to get it right. We need to find the right combination from top to six. Whoever can take responsibility and play the role, we require him to play in different situations. That is something that we are still working on, Jayawardene said.         
	He also felt that the Sri Lankan youngsters have been slightly outshone by their Indian counterparts.         
	Opportunities are there for them, but they have also been consistent. Suresh (Raina) and those guys have been playing good cricket. I think our guys need more confidence to go out and express themselves. They are our future. We just need to make sure that we get the right guys, he added.

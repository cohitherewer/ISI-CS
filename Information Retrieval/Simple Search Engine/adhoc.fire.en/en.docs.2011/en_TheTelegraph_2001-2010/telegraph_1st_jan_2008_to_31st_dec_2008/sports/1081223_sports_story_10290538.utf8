                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     RCTC all set for Jan. 1 start 
            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Its official now. Hoof beats will be heard again at the RCTC race ground from the New Years Day. The start of the cold weather season was delayed by two months, thanks to the outbreak of pyrexia (high fever) affecting almost the entire horse-strength in the RCTC stables.          
	The equine fever brought about a major setback to our winter racing plans but we are looking ahead for the January 1 start. Eighty horses have attained racing fitness and as many will be cleared to race in the following week, said Cyrus Madan, chairman RCTC, at a news conference on Sunday evening.There will be 24 fixtures during the truncated season and racing will be held mainly on weekends. Rs 6 crore have been offered as the stake money during the season, he added.          
	RCTC will hold all the five classics  including the Derby (March 1)  during the season which concludes on April 17.          
	Our Mumbai correspondent adds: The Maharashtra government has imposed a two month ban on the movement of horses from Pune to Mumbai. It means the start of the Mumbai season, may be delayed beyond mid-February.

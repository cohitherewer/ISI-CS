	Calcutta/New Delhi: As expected, Mahesh Bhupathi is back in the Davis Cup squad. The selection committee named him for next months Asia Oceania Group I first-round tie versus Uzbekistan. 
    
	Leander Paes, who suffered an ankle injury at the Australian Open and had to pull out of mixed doubles, will be the captain even if he is not fit to play. The selectors, however, expect him to recover in time for the clash with Uzbekistan, scheduled in Delhi from February 8-10. 
    
	Rohan Bopanna, Prakash Amritraj and young Somdev Dev Varman complete the line-up. National hard court champion Ashutosh Singh and national grass court winner Vishnu Vardhan have been named as standbys. 
    
	India had lost 1-4 the last time they faced Uzbekistan in an away tie. Next month, though, they will start as favourites on home territory as they will be playing on their favourite grasscourts. 
    
	Bhupathis last Davis Cup tie was against Pakistan, in April 2006. 
    
	The doubles ace, who got back to the Tour after a three-month lay-off following a surgery, had made himself available for selection sometime ago after having announced that he would never again play for India. 
    
	This being an Olympic year did influence my decision but Im not looking too far ahead, Bhupathi told The Telegraph. Im taking one tie at a time only. Bhupathi and Paes are expected to pair up for the Beijing Games, having agreed to put their differences aside. 
    
	Wont he be available if India beat Uzbekistan and come up against Japan, as is expected? 
    
	Let us first win this one, then well see You can never say in a Davis Cup tie, Bhupathi argued. 
    
	The AITA also announced the squad for Indias Fed Cup matches, to be be played in Bangkok from January 28. 
    
	US-based Shikha Uberoi replaced the injured Tara Iyer. The other members are Sania Mirza, Sunitha Rao and Isha Lakhani. 
    
	Hosts Thailand, Australia, China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, New Zealand and Uzbekistan are the other competing teams.

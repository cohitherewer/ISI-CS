                                                                                                                                                                                                     IOA chief defends   attire
            BEIJING BYTES                      
	 Facing flak from all quarters for allowing Sania Mirza and Sunitha Rao in casuals in the Olympic opening ceremony, IOA president Suresh Kalmadi said on Saturday that it was a decision taken by chef-de-mission K. Murugan. The two players had expressed a desire to be part of the contingent but had no time to change. Kalmadi said both the tennis players had just returned from a prolonged practice session and did not have enough time to deck up in the official sari for the march past, hence they turned out in casuals. Personally, their practice was more important for me than attending the ceremony. Im happy they still wanted to go. Murugan was a bit confused, since he thought asking Sania and Sunitha not to go could lead to a controversy , so he finally allowed them to attend the ceremony in casuals, Kalmadi told reporters. We had kept saris for all women athletes and it just happened that they didnt have time to change.   
	Djokovic fuming  
	Tennis star Novak Djokovic blasted conditions at the Beijing Olympics as extreme on Saturday, while the sports global chief played down fears over heat, humidity and smog. Djokovic said he had never experienced such humidity and hoped new rules would be made to protect the players. quot;I never, ever played in worse humidity than here, quot; the Serbian added. International Tennis Federation president Ricci Bitti said players were not at risk and contingency plans were in place.  
	School for gold  
	Top Chinese home appliance maker Haier Group said on Saturday that it was launching a programme to build one primary school in a poor rural area for every gold that China wins in Beijing. It would make its donations through Project Hope, a Chinese charity dedicated to improving access to education in poverty-stricken parts of the country.  
	French connection  
	Olympics head Jacques Rogge joined Francophone heads of state in a table tennis knockabout on Saturday at an event to celebrate French as an official language of the Beijing Games. Rogge congratulated Beijing organisers for ensuring French was fully represented and was confident that would be maintained at future Games.  
	Smog fixation  
	Achim Steiner, who heads the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and was in Beijing to see the Olympics opening, said many of the 30,000 journalists covering the Games were over-fixated on Chinas smog and had displayed short-term memories. After all, air pollution was a major concern in Los Angeles 24 years ago, he said.Though few now seem to recall the dramatic scene at the end of the womens marathon when the Swiss competitor (Gabriele Andersen-Scheiss) was seen staggering and stumbling from exhaustion, the heat and, perhaps, the effects of air pollution.  
	Bolt ahead: Greene  
	 Former world record holder Maurice Greene said Usain Bolts 100 metres performances this year had leapfrogged the Jamaican ahead of his rivals for Olympic gold. What Usain Bolt did earlier this year to run a (world record) 9.72 put himself on a totally different level to anyone else in the 100 metres, the retired Greene said.

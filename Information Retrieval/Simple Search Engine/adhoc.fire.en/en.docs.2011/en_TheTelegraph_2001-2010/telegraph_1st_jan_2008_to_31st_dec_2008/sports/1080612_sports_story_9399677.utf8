                                                                                                                                                                                                     India tipped to host 2009 SAFF Cup
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Srinagar: India is likely to host the next edition of the SAFF Cup scheduled in 2009, according to All India Football Federation sources.         
	Though the tournament is scheduled for 2009, it could spill over to 2010 as the AIFF is unlikely to hamper its own programmed to accommodate the tournament. India had earlier hosted the SAFF Cup in 1999 in Goa.

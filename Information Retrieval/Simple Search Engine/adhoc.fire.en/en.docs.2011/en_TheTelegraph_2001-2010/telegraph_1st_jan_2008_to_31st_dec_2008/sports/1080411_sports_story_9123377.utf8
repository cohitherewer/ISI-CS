                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tie wont stretch to fifth rubber, feels Paes
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Captain Leander Paes on Thursday said that he was confident of wrapping up the crucial Davis Cup encounter against Japan without the tie going into the fifth rubber.         
	Last time we played Uzbekistan I had a gut feeling that the tie would be extended till the fifth rubber, Paes said. This time it wont be like that. But we are ready for any challenge, he added.         
	The winners of the Asia/Oceania Zone Group I tie, beginning at the DLTA courts on Friday, will progress to the World Group play-off.         
	India, who have won their seven home ties against Japan since 1961, last played in the elite 16-nation World Group in 1998 and have not appeared in the play-offs since 2005.         
	Paes, who holds a 48-21 singles record in Davis Cup, appeared confident that with home advantage and a known surface, India have an edge over the visitors. Davis Cup is all about experience, especially if you are playing away from home. The Japanese are better than us on paper but its no secret that our guys are very good on grass, Paes said.         
	His doubles partner Mahesh Bhupathi also said the same thing. Our boys are more comfortable on grass. Although the Japanese are ranked higher than us, we have an advantage on the grass court.         
	Japans non-playing captain Eiji Tekeuchi said the grass court wont be hard to tackle. We checked the surface two days ago and it looked perfect. The surface is fair for both the sides. The heat is a problem for us. We practised with heaters on for a few days before coming to India.         
	In the second singles on Friday, world No.261 Prakash Amritraj will be up against Go Soeda, ranked 156th. The US-based Prakash said: I am not really bothered whether I play first singles or second. I am absolutely ready for the tie and cant wait for tomorrow.

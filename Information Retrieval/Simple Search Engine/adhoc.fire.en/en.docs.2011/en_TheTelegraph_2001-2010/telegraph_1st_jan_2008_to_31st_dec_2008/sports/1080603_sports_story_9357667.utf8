The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Henry set for 100th cap
                                                                                                                                                                                           Henry set for 100th cap
                      
	Paris: Frances final Euro 2008 warm-up should be a special occasion for Thierry Henry, who is expected to win his 100th cap against Colombia at the Stade de France on Tuesday. The 30-year-old striker, who has scored 44 goals in 99 appearances for France  a record, should play some part in the game to become the sixth French player to reach that milestone.         
	The Barcelona forward will join Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly, Zinedine Zidane, Patrick Vieira and Didier Deschamps as the French players to have played 100 internationals or more.         
	Defender Thuram, Henrys teammate at Barcelona, holds the national record with 139.         
	Henry won his first cap in a 2-1 win over South Africa in 1997. He was a member of the squad who lifted the World Cup on home soil in 1998, although he did not play in the final, and helped France win the European championship two years later.         
	After eight years at Arsenal, Henry joined Barcelona last year and has struggled to adapt, although he did recapture his goalscoring form towards the end of the season.         
	He made headlines last week when he was quoted in a newspaper interview as saying he might retire from international football after the June 7-29 finals in Austria and Switzerland.

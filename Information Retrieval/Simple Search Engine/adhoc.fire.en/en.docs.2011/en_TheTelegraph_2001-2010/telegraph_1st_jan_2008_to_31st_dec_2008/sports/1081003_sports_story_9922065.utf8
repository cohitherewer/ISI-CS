The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lee and Co. vow to be patient
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lee and Co. vow to be patient
                      
	Melbourne: For centuries Indian pitches are believed to be tailor-made for batsmen and spinners and not for fast bowlers, but Brett Lee and Co. feel pacers key to success in sub-continent conditions is patience.         
	Though the Australian bowling department doesnt have any experience of playing Test cricket in India, they have made a pact to be patient in the upcoming four-match Test series to plot the hosts downfall.         
	Patience is definitely going to be a word that we will be using through the whole Test series.         
	I just think the key to bowling over here, going on what you read and what you hear from past players, is to be nice and patient, Lee was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	Lee, who needs three wickets to pass Craig McDermott (291) as Australias fourth highest Test wicket-taker, is aware of the fact that he is the spearhead of the Aussie bowling attack.         
	We are up against world class batsmen, we are up against wickets that arent going to be conducive to fast bowling, and the weather is going to be really hot.         
	We have to try as a team to block all that stuff out and just really focus on the way we know, to be nice and patient, he said.         
	Lees colleague in the pace department Stuart Clark said in Indian conditions, pacers need to maintain discipline to be successful.         
	I think the wickets become harder to bat on. They dont bounce, there is no pace in them and they dont carry, Clark said.         
	Leg Before Wicket and bowled become a really useful mode of dismissal, rather than just caught. In Australia a lot of the guys get caught behind the wicket.         
	Bowled and lbws are a big way of getting out over here, he said.         
	We have to work long and hard for four or five days. If we can do that, then we will have a chance at the end, he added.           (PTI)

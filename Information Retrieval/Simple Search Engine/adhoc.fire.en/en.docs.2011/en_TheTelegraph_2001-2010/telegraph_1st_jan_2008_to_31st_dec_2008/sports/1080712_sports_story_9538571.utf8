                                                                                                                                                                                           Coach: Im very satisfied
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa looked a satisfied man with his teams comprehensive victory against Peerless in their opening match of the season.         
	Claiming that the team would get better as the season progresses, the Bagan coach after the match said: I am very satisfied with the teams performance. The level of fitness was also very satisfactory.         
	We could have scored a couple of more goals, but that is not important. Whats important is creating chances, which we did.         
	Asked about his teams sluggish pace on the ground, Karim said it was only the first match of the season and there was nothing to be worried.         
	This is the start of the season. We have worked very hard for five weeks before this. The players are still not very fresh. I am confident that the team will only get better from here, Karim said.         
	Meanwhile, Peerless coach Mihir Bose sounded a bit worried after his sides second loss in as many matches. About a dozen players have moved from my last years side. It will take some time for me to rebuild this team, Bose said.

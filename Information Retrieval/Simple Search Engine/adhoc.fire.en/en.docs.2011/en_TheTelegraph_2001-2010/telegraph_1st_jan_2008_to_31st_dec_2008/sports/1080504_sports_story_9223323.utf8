The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal storms into title round
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nadal storms into title round
                  Rafael Nadal of Spain hits a return to Denis Gremelmayr during their semi-final match at the Barcelona Open on Saturday. (Reuters)                     
	Barcelona: Top seed Rafael Nadal produced a claycourt masterclass on Saturday to demolish German Denis Gremelmayr 6-1, 6-0 to reach the final of the Barcelona Open.         
	The Spaniard, trying to win the title for the fourth successive year, was in irrepressible form as he raced to victory in 50 minutes.         
	He will play either Spanish second seed David Ferrer or Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka in the final.         
	I didnt know much about him, Nadal admitted. But I know he reached the semi-finals in Estoril (last month) and he beat some good players to get through today.         
	I am just very happy that I played to my level and am pleased to be through to the final.         
	Gremelmayr, who took a set off world No. 1 Roger Federer in the Estoril semi-finals, had beaten three seeded players  James Blake, Dmitry Tursunov and Nicolas Almagro  en route to the last four but he was totally outclassed by a rampant Nadal.         
	The German held his opening service game but that was as good as it got as Nadal tore him apart with his best performance of the week.         
	In the quarter finals, Nadal survived an early scare to beat Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela 6-4, 6-2.         
	The top seed, trying to win the title for the fourth successive time, looked off-colour early on to trail 4-2 but roared back to clinch the match. German Gremelmayr edged out another Spaniard, 10th seed Nicolas Almagro 6-2, 3-6, 7-6.         
	Nadal conceded just four games to the Argentine the last time they met but Chela began superbly, taking risks and putting the top seed under rare pressure.         
	Chela broke the Nadal serve to love to lead 4-2 but the match effectively hinged on an epic seventh game.         
	Chela had five chances to extend his lead to 5-2 but Nadal suddenly sprung to life, taking his third break-point chance to get back on terms.         
	He broke again two games later before serving out the set and after breaking the Argentine in the first game of the second set, he eased to victory.         
	If it had gone to 5-2 it would have been very difficult to win the first set, Nadal said in a courtside interview.         
	But getting back to 4-3 gave me a lot of confidence and I am very happy to be in the semi-finals for the fourth year in a row.         
	Second seed David Ferrer came through his second tough battle in as many days to reach the semi-finals, beating Spanish compatriot Tommy Robredo 7-6, 6-4.         
	The world No. 5, pushed hard by Ecuadorian Nicolas Lapentti in the previous round, battled past the sixth seed in a match lasting two hours, five minutes.         
	He will play 14th seed Stanislas Wawrinka for a place in the final after the Swiss fought off the challenge of another Spaniard, Albert Montanes, 6-3, 6-7, 6-4.         
	Wawrinka held match point in the second-set tiebreak, but the Spanish world number 87 hit back to force a decider.         
	Montanes then fought back from 5-2 down in the third set to be back on serve at 5-4, only to lose his serve again as the Swiss claimed victory after two hours, 46 minutes.         
	I knew I had to be aggressive and go for my shots, because Montanes is a very good clay-court player, Wawrinka said.         
	I could have closed it out in the second set but I was not worried because I was confident I could win it in the third set.           (REUTERS)

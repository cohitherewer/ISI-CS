	Moscow: Jitender Kumar (51kg) pummelled Welshman Jo Gage 18-6 while A.L. Lakra (57kg) got a walkover into the semi-finals, assuring India of an unprecedented four medals at the AIBA boxing World Cup here Thursday.         
	After Akhil Kumar (54kg) and Dinesh Kumars (81kg) resounding quarter final victories Wednesday, Jitender and Lakras entry to the last four stage also extended Indias unbeaten run at the prize money event, where the gold medallist will take home $10,000 and the silver and bronze medal winners $5,000 and $2,500, respectively.         
	Lakra got a walkover against Mexican Arturo Reyes Santos, who was deemed over-weight before the bout.         
	Jitender next faces Pan-American Championships gold medallist Hernandez Lafita of Cuba, who beat Moldovan Alexandr Riscan 10-6.         
	Lakra, on the other hand, would either be up against World Championship bronze medallist Yang Li of China or Cubas Idel Torriente.         
	An aggressive Jitender dominated the proceedings from the word go and seized the early initiative by leading 5-0 after the first round. He cooled off a bit in the second round and landed just three scoring punches but a tight defence ensured that Gages score-sheet remained blank.         
	The 22-year-old Haryana-boxer, who bravely fought with 11 stitches on his chin during his quarter final loss in the Beijing Olympics, was back to his attacking best in the penultimate round and earned seven points to his opponents three to ensure a comfortable lead going into the final round.

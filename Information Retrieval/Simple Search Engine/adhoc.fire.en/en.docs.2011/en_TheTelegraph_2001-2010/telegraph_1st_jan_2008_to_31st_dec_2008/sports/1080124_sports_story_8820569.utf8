                                                   Odafe set to become highest-paid footballer

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	New Delhi: Churchill Brothers prolific goal getter Odafe Onyeka Okolie is set to become Indias highest-paid footballer next season. 
    
	If information emanating from Churchill Brothers sources is to be believed, then the Nigerian striker might receive a pay packet of anything between Rs 70 to 80 lakh for the 2008-09 season, the highest ever individual payment in Indian football. 
    
	Last season, Mohun Bagan broke all records when they lured Brazilian sharpshooter Jose Barreto back to Calcutta with a contract worth Rs 60 lakh. But this season, Barreto reportedly accepted a pay cut to settle for a lesser amount. 
    
	Dempos Nigerian striker Ranty Martins became the highest paid footballer this season when he signed a Rs 52 lakh seasonal contract with the Goan outfit. Jose Barreto, Yusif Yakubu (Mahindra United), Odafe and Roberto Beto Mendes (Dempo) are the other four best paid foreign footballers in India. 
    
	With 13 goals in 12 matches including three hattricks, Odafe is currently the hottest property in Indian football and is being chased by every top team in the country. 
    
	Sources said that Churchill had to up the ante after Odafe received a fabulous offer from Mohun Bagan that might make the Nigerian the best paid footballer in Calcutta. 
    
	The offer from Mohun Bagan is really big, Churchill sources confirmed. Churchill will have to match the offer if they are serious about retaining his services. After all, Odafes three-year contract with Churchill will come to an end this season. 
    
	The club supremo Churchill Alemao, who is also a minister in the Goa cabinet, said that he would retain Odafe at any cost. 
    
	Odafe is priceless. We are not going to lose him under any circumstances. We would certainly do the needful to retain him for the next season. 
    
	But then, Odafe himself dropped a hint about leaving Goa when he told The Telegraph that he was not against the idea of going back to Calcutta, a city which once failed to notice his skills.

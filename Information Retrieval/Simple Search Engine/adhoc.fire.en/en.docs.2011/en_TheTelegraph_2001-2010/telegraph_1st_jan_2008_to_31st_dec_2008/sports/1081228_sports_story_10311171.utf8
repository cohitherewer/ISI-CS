            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: An inspirational bowling performance by Karnataka saw them bounce back into the reckoning by reducing Saurashtra to 183 for nine in the first innings of the Ranji Trophy quarter finals at the Brabourne Stadium here on Saturday.         
	Karnataka pacers Vinay Kumar (2/46) and debutant S Aravind (1/31) exposed the chinks in the Saurashtra line-up with their accuracy and control on the second day, after their first innings ended on a respectable total of 305.         
	Saurashtra openers Chirag Pathak (24) and Bhushan Chauhan (24) made a promising start but the other batsmen, playing their first away game of the season, were found wanting in application and technique on a true wicket and against an inspired opponent.         
	Aravind had the prolific Cheteshwar Pujara (1) caught behind with an away swinger for his maiden first-class wicket while Vinay Kumar picked up Pathak and the obdurate Sitanshu Kotak (11).         
	Summarised scores         
	 In Ahmedabad: HP 250 vs Mumbai 405/6 (W. Jaffer 108, R. Sharma 98; V. Bhatia 3/136).         
	 In Mumbai: Karnataka 305 (R. Uthappa 139, V. Kumar 48; R. Jadeja 5/82) vs Saurashtra 183/9 (R. Jadeja 38; C. Raghu 2/8, S. Joshi 2/32, V. Kumar 2/46).         
	 In Vadodara: UP 305 amp; 76/1 vs Gujarat 117 (P. Kumar 5/25, I. Ahmed 3/73).         
	All matches to continue.

	Paris: Frances Gilles Simon closed in on a place at the season-ending Masters Cup by beating Russian Igor Andreev 6-3, 7-5 in the Paris Masters second round on Wednesday.         
	Simon, eighth in the ATP Race after reaching this months Madrid Masters final, will secure a trip to Shanghai if his closest rivals do not reach the final at the Paris indoor event.         
	Spains world No. 1 Rafael Nadal and sixth seed Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, two of the five already in the Masters Cup, also reached the third round in Paris.         
	Top seed Nadal beat Frances Florent Serra 6-2, 6-4 while Davydenko overcame Croat Ivan Ljubicic 7-6, 7-5.         
	The 10th-seeded Simon twice recovered after trailing Andreev, against whom he saved four match points in the Madrid first round, to set up a third-round clash with seventh-seeded American Andy Roddick.         
	Simons victory means Argentine David Nalbandian, who beat German Nicolas Kiefer 7-6, 6-3 earlier on Wednesday, must retain his Paris title to book a trip to China.         
	He next faces compatriot Juan Martin Del Potro, who is seventh in the ATP Race and could lose and still book one of the three remaining qualifying spots.         
	Spains David Ferrer, ninth in the ATP Race, suffered a 3-6, 2-6 defeat by German Philipp Kohlschreiber. (Reuters)

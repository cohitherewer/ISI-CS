	Mysore: Karnataka captain Robin Uthappa hit his second century of the season but Rahul Dravids bad form with the bat continued as Karnataka finished Day I at 277 for seven against Andhra Pradesh in a Ranji Trophy Elite Division tie at the Gangothri Glades Cricket Ground on Sunday.         
	A late fight back from the Andhra bowlers helped them claim a share of the opening day honours.         
	Uthappa and K.B. Pawan had little trouble negotiating the new ball after they chose to bat after winning the toss.         
	A couple of quick wickets brought Andhra back in the game.         
	Dravid (39), after leaving alone a number of deliveries, finally managed to get the scoreboard ticking.

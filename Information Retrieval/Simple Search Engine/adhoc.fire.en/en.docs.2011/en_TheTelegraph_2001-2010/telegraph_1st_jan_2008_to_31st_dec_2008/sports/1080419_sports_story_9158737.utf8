The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chopra 3 shots off the lead
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chopra 3 shots off the lead

	Hilton Head Island: A solid round of two-under 69 took Daniel Chopra to tied 23rd on Day I of the $5.5 million Verizon Heritage Classic on Thursday.         
	Chopra shot a 34 on his front nine and a 35 on his way back at the par-71 Harbour Town Golf Links to be three shots behind the leaders.         
	Chopra, a Swede of Indian origin, went about his work without dropping a shot and two birdies came early on the par-five second and fifth holes, but had 13 pars in a row after that.         
	He did not make too many mistakes and found the fairways 79 per cent of the time. He also hit 72 per cent greens in regulation. He had 29 putts for the round.         
	Former champion Justin Leonard fired a sparkling five-under-par 66 to set the first-round pace with fellow-Americans Lucas Glover and five-time winner Davis Love III.         
	American Stewart Cink, the 2004 champion, was a further stroke adrift along with nine others, including compatriots Anthony Kim, John Rollins and Charles Howell III, plus Colombias Camilo Villegas.         
	It was a nice day, and wonderful weather-wise, Leonard, 35, told reporters after hitting a five-iron to two feet at the last to set up his sixth birdie of the round.         
	It was great to play without a whole lot of wind after last week when you (had to) play so defensively. You come here and play a little more aggressively.         
	Leonard, winner of the 2002 Heritage Classic, said his most significant hole of the round was the par-four 10th where he chipped in to save par.         
	Among the other big names, American world No. 9 Jim Furyk opened with a 68 and third-ranked South African Ernie Els battled to a 72. (Reuters)

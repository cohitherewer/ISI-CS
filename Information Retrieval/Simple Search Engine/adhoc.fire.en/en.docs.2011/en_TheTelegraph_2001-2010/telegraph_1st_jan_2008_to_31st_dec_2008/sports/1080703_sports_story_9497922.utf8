The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahela: Adapting to different Indian teams is a challenge
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mahela: Adapting to different Indian teams is a challenge
  -   The Sri Lankan captain on the forthcoming tour by India and more           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                             Mahela Jayawardene      
	Karachi: Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lankas captain (adjudged the ICCs best in 2006), spoke to The Telegraph in his Pearl Continental suite on Wednesday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q With Team Indias tour of Sri Lanka not far off, have you started to look ahead too?         
	A Not really, but we know its very important for us... Indias the Big Brother in a lot of ways and, so, all eyes are on the tour whenever your team comes calling... Well be focusing on those Tests and ODIs as soon as this Asia Cup gets over.         
	The tour starts with the three-Test series. How do you, personally, rate India in Test cricket?         
	The Indians have been consistent, which is a big factor in international cricket... Theyve got matchwinners, with the batting being stronger than the bowling... Actually, theyve got some brilliant performers who handle pressure well... Clearly, the Indians are formidable, but weve got a good record at home... Thats going to count.         
	Would you prefer facing a younger Team India in the ODIs or the hugely experienced Team India in Tests?         
	(Laughs) Trying to adapt to different Indian teams is a challenge for us... Both teams have their strengths and weaknesses and its important for us to focus separately on Tests and ODIs. Obviously, we already have an idea of the combinations India could come up with... Well be looking to counter whatever is thrown at us.         
	In Sanath Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralidharan and Chaminda Vaas, you have exceptions in your own team, but whats your take on the debate linking age with selection?         
	I think much could depend on how the teams want to go forward in international cricket... The combination  whether to have one, two or three senior guys in the XI could also come into play... The strategy is important... Nowadays, one-day cricket does demand a lot of energy and, so, the advantage is with the younger generation... Having said that, if the seniors are fit and have retained the passion and hunger, then theres no reason why they cant be playing... The bottomline is youve got to assess what a particular player brings to the table and how he fits into the combination being planned.         
	So, age isnt an issue with you?         
	No... I mean even if somebody is 40-41 but meets the requirements, then he could be playing... However, my view is that once somebody is on the wrong side of the 30s, then his achievements of the past shouldnt be a consideration... That must go out of the window... He should, in my opinion, only be judged by what he has done in the past 10-12 months. Its a call that has to be made by the selectors and the team management.         
	Youve got the Sanaths and also a clutch of young players. Whats your approach in the dressing room?         
	The best way to handle everybody is to treat them equally... Of course, the youngsters have to respect the seniors... Thats part of our team culture. The rules, if I may add, are applicable to everybody.         
	Is captaining off the field a bigger challenge given the age difference within your team?         
	Look, one has to understand that the team is made up of different individuals and each one will have his likes and dislikes... As they could react differently, you do need to give them space to do their own thing. (After a pause) Everyone in our team has a role and each one has to be a team man.         
	I understand youve given your players the freedom to express themselves out in the middle... Have you done so consciously?         
	I have... Within the teams game plan, the idea is not to curb anybodys individuality... After all, the players have been picked because they bring something special to the team.         
	You seem to be enjoying the captaincy...         
	(Grins) Yes... It can get tough if the enjoyment isnt there... I wasnt happy with our one-day form earlier this year, but things have gone well in this Asia Cup... I try to push myself... Try to push my team to get better.         
	Do you too feel that cricket, in general, is getting more aggressive? That the pace is picking up?         
	I do, indeed... It has been happening for over a year now and captains cant have fixed ideas... This is a challenging time... A lot of younger players are coming in, across teams, and theyre coming with a different attitude... Nowadays, teams need to adapt quicker... Having said that, its best not to complicate things... Cricket isnt that complicated.         
	Will the Twenty20 game kill one-day cricket?         
	No... The IPL could continue to be a hit, but I dont see one-day cricket dying... On tours, the selectors will continue to pick only two teams  for Tests and ODIs... I dont think three teams are going to be picked... Twenty20 cricket, though, should improve the skill-level of the cricketers and that will then improve one-day cricket as well.         
	What was it like playing (for Kings XI Punjab) under Yuvraj Singh in the IPL?         
	Yuvi was brilliant... All of us learnt a lot from the first edition and will be better (prepared) next year.         
	Your thoughts on Thursdays match versus India?         
	We do look to win every match... Our line-up for tomorrow, though, will depend on this evenings result... The big one, most definitely, is Sundays final.         
	Finally, are the players more comfortable with a former captain, Arjuna Ranatunga, at the helm of Sri Lanka Cricket?         
	There are good things and bad things about it... Arjuna has only recently taken over and the administration is settling down... Other ex-cricketers are also involved, which certainly is a good thing... Generally, former cricketers understand the needs of current players better... But i-ts still an interim set-up back at home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes-Dlouhy lose, miss semis berth
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Paes-Dlouhy lose, miss semis berth
                      
	Shanghai: Lukas Dlouhy and Leander Paes lost their second round robin match of the Masters Cup doubles event to miss out on a semi-final berth.         
	The Indo-Czech pair lost to Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski 6-7 (2-7), 3-6 in the Gold group.         
	In the other Gold group match, Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic guaranteed themselves a place in the semis with a 6-1, 6-4 win over Jonas Bjorkman and Kevin Ullyett.         
	In singles action, Briton Andy Murray claimed a place in the semi-finals with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Frenchman Gilles Simon.         
	The 21-year-old world No. 4 fended off a mid-match fight-back from Simon to join Serb Novak Djokovic in the last four on his debut at the season finale.         
	Swiss Federer kept his hopes of a fifth Masters Cup title alive with an unconvincing 7-6, 6-4 victory over Radek Stepanek, the world No. 27 who replaced Andy Roddick when the American pulled out with an ankle injury earlier in the day.         
	Defending champion Federer, who lost his opening match to Simon on Monday, started well with a break in the first service game but looked well below his best and allowed the Czech back into the match.         
	The world No. 2 needed a tie-break to win the first set and was broken when serving for the second, finally clinching his first win of the week when Stepanek double faulted.         
	Simon, the world No. 9 again impressed but paid the price of converting just one of eight break points he held on Murrays serve.         
	Murray started confidently, grabbing two breaks after some long opening exchanges to lead 4-0. Simon, though, showed in his victory against Federer that he could be an awkward customer and a change in tactics shifted the balance of the match.

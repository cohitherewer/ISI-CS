                                                   East Bengal desperate for a turnaround 

 - Barreto warns Bagan of the rivals fightback under Manoranjan today 
   A STAFF REPORTER 
                     
	Calcutta: Quite a few East Bengal true-blues made their way to the club tent on Sunday morning, desperately seeking a turnaround under Manoranjan Bhattacharjee. Those milling around the members stand reflected the mood best. With their sentiments swinging from cheers for the new coach and jeers for the officials present at the ground, their voices rose and rose to tip Manoranjan the wink about their wishlist. 
    
	The former India defender ignored the supporters on his way to the dressing room and, much like his playing days, tackled their demands with his characteristic reticence. He has been thrust into an examination that others would not dare to take. 
    
	Its about surviving more than the pursuit of honours in the ONGC I-League, about negotiating a confident Mohun Bagan who have beaten them four times in a row at the Salt Lake Stadium and, of course, about lifting the team from the shadow of a misfired Subrata Bhattacharya reign  Manoranjans plate has been replenished even before the ball of his first match in charge has been kicked. 
    
	Manoranjan is not a professor waxing eloquent to a bunch of demoralised students about how to seize an opportunity and turn things around. For him, its building confidence quietly, with minimum fuss. 
    
	Maybe football should not just be about meticulous practice sessions like Subratas, tactics boards like Amal Dattas or in-depth scouting of the opposition like Subhas Bhowmicks. It is also about talking business in simple words, just like this reticent but brave man. 
    
	Manoranjan knows that for a change in fortunes, the brain is required as much as the heart. 
    
	The problem with the team is in the mind. The players need mental discipline. Mohun Bagan is a big opponent but if we remain mentally strong, we can be successful, Manoranjan said on the eve of the second-leg derby. 
    
	These are words which havent escaped the notice of the rivals. Jose Ramirez Barreto, for instance, warned his teammates of an East Bengal pushed up against a wall. Its going to be East Bengals fight to come back under a new coach. They are always dangerous under such circumstances and we have to be extra-careful, the Brazilian playmaker said on Sunday. 
    
	The mood was the same with his coach Carlos Roberto Pereira. I dont think East Bengal will be relegated. Whatever the condition they are in now, theres no question of taking them for granted. Its a big match for both teams and its always 50-50, Pereira maintained. 
    
	True to the rivals anticipation, a do-it-now wind is blowing through the East Bengal camp. We have to give our best tomorrow, said Alvito DCunha, who has often been accused of non-cooperating with Bhattacharya. Nothing can signal our comeback better than a win against Mohun Bagan, pointed out Soumik Dey. 
    
	The players should draw motivation from their coach, taking the clock back to the first-ever derby held at Salt Lake Stadium, once known as the East Bengal bastion and now a place where Mohun Bagan inflicted defeat on them four consecutive times. In the 1984 IFA Shield final, Manoranjan stood like a rock against the Mohun Bagan of Prashanta Banerjee, Krishanu Dey, Bidesh Bose and Babu Mani. East Bengal won that match 1-0. 
    
	Leading scorer Edmilson, his partner Ashim Biswas and defender M. Suresh will miss tomorrows match through injury. But Manoranjan must ensure that riding his players war cry, East Bengal live up to their name, to what the famous shirt means to their long-suffering supporters. 
    
	But such is the confidence sweeping the Mohun Bagan players at present that they are thinking beyond Mondays traditional clash. They have seen a ray of hope in runaway league leaders Dempos maiden defeat to Mahindra United. 
    
	With 17 points from 11 matches, Mohun Bagan are 10 points adrift of Dempo who have played a game more. Both Carlos and his captain Bhaichung Bhutia believe many more ups ets could happen in the coming days. 
    
	Dempos loss has given us a chance. We need to rise to the occasion and keep our chase on as strongly as possible, stressed Bhaichung. 
    
	Against the Bhaichungs ambitions, East Bengals job is clearly cut out  of ending a long and depressing ritual of panicking on big stages.

        A STAFF REPORTER            Action during Mohammedan Sporting of Calcutta and their Dhaka counterparts IFA Shield match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The two Mohammedan Sportings, Calcutta and Dhaka outfits, dished out a goalless draw in an IFA Shield group A match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.         
	The draw, however, was not totally devoid of excitement as both the teams squandered a lot of chances. If Nigerian Mike Okoro was to be blamed for the city teams plight, captain Nwachumku Paul MacJames missed as many sitters for the Dhaka club.         
	With both teams taking time to assess their opponents, Okoro got a chance midway into the first half.         
	The Nigerian failed to convert his effort in what could have been a great way to start the black and white brigades campaign. Anticipating Okoros surge, Dhaka custodian Aminul Haque blocked before he could fire.         
	Even coach Shabbir Ali acknowledged that Okoro should have converted the goal. It was a good chance for him (Okoro). It would have been really good had we taken the lead in the first half.         
	We had more chances than our opponents. Its not that the team is out of practice. But the players will improve as they play more matches. However, weve not conceded a goal in our last five-six matches, Ali, the Calcutta teams coach, said in the post-match press conference.         
	After their triumph in the Pradyut Dutta Memorial Trophy, which earned them a place in the IFA Shield, the city giants got a reality check.         
	Jyoti Kumars passes may have been clinical but the strikers, Okoro and K. Kulothangan proved to be a disappointment. It was a miserable second half for the black-and-whites. The city teams efforts either went wayward or were blocked by the rival goalkeeper who had a very good match.         
	Okoro had another golden chance in the 69th minute when his right-footer missed the woodwork. Prasanta Chakraborty and Roque Barreto combine, too, failed to get that elusive goal as they missed a sitter in the 77th minute.         
	In fact, the city outfit must have been thanking their lucky stars as their Dhaka counterparts matched them in profligacy. The visitors got their share of chances only to waste them in gay abandon.         
	MacJames and Wali Faisal combine missed a sitter in the 59th minute. When Faisals shot hit the cross, the captain tried to head in the rebound. But Haque blocked his header. MacJames again failed to convert just before the final whistle.         
	The Dhaka teams coach blamed it on the players fitness.         
	We have some fitness concerns We hope to fix those before our next match. Everybody has high expectations from us. We were under a lot of pressure. I think our players need a bit of time to acclimatise to the conditions, coach Mohammed Shafiqul Islam Manik said.         
	Assessing their opponents, the Dhaka coach said: They arent a lot better than us. A win would have been better, obviously. We squandered some chances. There were a few mistakes too. But some decisions also went against us, he said.

	Berlin: World No. 1 Justine Henin was dumped out of the German Open on Thursday, losing 7-5, 3-6, 1-6 to 13th seed Dinara Safina of Russia in the third round.         
	The Belgian top seed had easily won five previous meetings against the powerful Safina, sister of former mens world No. 1 Marat Safin, but was broken eight times on the clay at the Steffi Graf stadium and looked well short of her best.         
	Safina served for the match at 5-0 in the deciding set but Henin saved three match points and broke back only to lose her service and the match in the next game when she skewed a backhand into the sidelines.         
	Its never easy to lose and to lose that way, Henin, 25, said at a news conference. During the whole match I didnt have the intensity and the consistency and it was quite tough. Theres nothing more I can really say. Shes been better. Thats it.         
	The 22-year-old Safina said it was the best win of her career.         
	Going into the match I had inside the feeling that today I have a chance, she said at a news conference.         
	Henin misses out on a clash with former world No. 1 Serena Williams in the last eight in Berlin. The American thumped Polands 11th-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska 6-3, 6-1.

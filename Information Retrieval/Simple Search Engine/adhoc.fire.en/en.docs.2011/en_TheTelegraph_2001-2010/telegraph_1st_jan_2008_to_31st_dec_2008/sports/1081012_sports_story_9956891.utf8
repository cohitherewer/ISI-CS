            HONKY DORY                            
	With Autonomy withdrawn, on veterinary grounds, Dancing Dynamite gets a lucky break to win the 2,000m Nanoli Stud Pune Derby, a Grade I race, which takes the centre stage in the Pune race card on Sunday. Jockey Suraj Narredu partners the Mansoor Shah trained horse who is unbeaten in his careers four starts.          
	Dancing Dynamite also has a point to prove. His recent victory over Antonios was claimed in the stewards room. He may settle all scores in the Derby which promises the winner a handsome purse of over Rs 31 6 lakh.

World jives with Calypso King | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)

            KEVIN GARSIDE IN BEIJING                        Usain Bolt      
	Usain Bolt is 22 today (Thursday). The world is already a different place; Michael Phelps so last week, Michael Johnson nowhere.         
	A night out with Bolt in Beijing is something to behold. Carnival meets the Peking Opera. In any other context, the respective codes would struggle to surmount the culture barrier. But when Calypso Boy runs, little is lost in translation.         
	While he was celebrating the dethroning of an athletics giant with a shoeless shuffle trackside, the Jamaican minister for sport was holding forth on the qualities required to be Usain Bolt  discipline, ambition and commitment. Her oration in the bowels of the Birds Nest amounted to an outline of the class theory of sporting success. Poor boy escapes poverty via his flying feet and the marriage of talent and graft.         
	Bolt made a field of world-class sprinters look like entrants in Its A Knockout, only these participants werent laughing.         
	Like heavyweights in boxing, sprinters are totemic in track and field. The health of the sport is measured by the chemical status of a sprinters blood. The past is tainted by drugs. Suspicion clings. This was the inference Unger was steering his German audience towards. Ben Johnson carries the indelible stain of substance abuse, stuck for ever in a kind of athletics purgatory. Linford Christie tested positive for nandrolone. Dwain Chambers sat at home cursing the cocktail with which he flooded his system. The list goes on.         
	Despite this, and the charged view of an embittered rival, none of sprintings sinister history attaches to Bolt. To lose him to a positive test would be heartbreaking for athletics and crushing for us.         
	He is wiping the slate clean, a young champion taking the game forward using nothing more than the hand he was dealt by Mother Nature. Even the name is beautiful: Bolt  born to fire. What he has achieved here in Beijing none has done before. It was not only about the 100m time but the manner of delivery, the gambol across the line. He might have shredded 9.6sec. He didnt care. The party had already started.         
	The 200m was different. This is his event, a discipline he made his own as a 15-year-old with the worlds fastest junior time. To end the 12-year reign of Johnson as a senior was wish fulfilment of the highest order. I just blew my mind, he said. I blew the worlds mind.         
	Bolt has been likened to Jesse Owens, such is the impact he has made at these Games. The message is not political, just awesome. Everyone gets it. In London hell be at his peak. That should sell some tickets.         
	A small priesthood of athletics commentators have known about Bolt since he set fire to a host of junior world records as a teenager. And his global coronation surprised none in Jamaica.         
	The rest of the world delights in making Bolts acquaintance, a breath of fresh air in a sport in need of renewal. Speed is the thing. We are drawn to his achievements through some primal dimension. We cannot take our eyes off him. On the subject of which, Bolt was dealing in just that kind of currency when he handed the flowers presented to him during the 100m medal ceremony to Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, a stunning example of womanhood by any gauge.         
	The transaction was carried out in the athletes village; the flowers intended to bring her luck. As a world-record holder who would go on to shatter her own mark en route to gold, Isinbayeva was beyond the influence of charms. You cannot fault a man for trying.         
	If an athlete has any doubts, any insecurities, the moments before a race will find them. These sprint boys fiddle their way through endless rituals; stretching muscles already warm, tying laces for the nth time. Then silence. Its showtime.         
	Twenty seconds after the starter-gun split the night air, Bolt was enveloped in the flag of Jamaica, his birthday celebrations under way. He said all he wanted was his bed. Fat chance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India A fall for 248
                                                                                                                                                                                           India A fall for 248
                      
	Chennai: Allrounder Nathan McCullum scalped a career best six for 90 as New Zealand A bowled out India A for 248 in their first innings on the opening day of their four-day cricket match on Sunday.         
	The off-spinner, who had bowled just 11 overs without success in the tri-series also involving Australia, ran through the inconsistent Indian batting line up, bowling 30.4 overs unchanged from the Pavilion end after being pressed into the attack in the 16th over.         
	M. Vijay (45) and in-form Yusuf Pathan (44) were the main scorers.         
	The hosts failed to capitalise after winning the toss on the flat turf and lost wickets at regular intervals to be bowled out for 248 in 75.4 overs in the post-tea session.         
	New Zealand started their reply strongly and were 36 for no loss in 12 overs at close of play with Aaron Redmond (31) and B J Walting (2) at the crease.         
	McCullum, elder brother of batsman Brendon McCullum, took wickets at vital stages and his victims included Vijay, captain Suresh Raina (21), Jayadev Shah (38) and Pathan.         
	Pacers Michael Mason (1/23) and Trent Boult (1/42) and spinner Watling (2/31) gave McCullum good support.         
	After a shaky start losing opener Sahil Kukreja (5) in the fifth over, the Indians recovered well through Vijay (45) and Shikar Dhawan (27).         
	The two appeared to be settling down for a big score when McCullum struck first. He had Vijay snapped up in the slip with a good ball in the 24th over to break the 71-run second wicket partnership.         
	Pathan, who was dropped by Mason at point off McCullum with his score on one and the team total at 132/4, and Saha rescued India adding 54 runs for the sixth wicket. Pathan fell going for an unnecessary pull shot just before tea break and was caught at long on by Trent Boult.

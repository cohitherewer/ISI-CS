	Melbourne: Adam Gilchrist produced a 83 off 50 balls before a batting collapse by Australia gave Sri Lanka a 13-run victory on Friday.         
	Matthew Hayden was rested for the match. This was Australias first match after the opener was reprimanded by CA for his remark against Harbhajan Singh.           (REUTERS)

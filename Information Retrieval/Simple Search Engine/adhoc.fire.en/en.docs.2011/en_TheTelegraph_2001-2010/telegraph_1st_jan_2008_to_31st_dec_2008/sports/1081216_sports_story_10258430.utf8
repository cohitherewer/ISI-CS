The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachins knock superb: Kevin
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sachins knock superb: Kevin
  - First Test 
  -   England lose by 6 wickets after dominating most of the match         OUR CORRESPONDENT              Mahendra Singh Dhoni after India won the first test against England on Monday. (PTI)                             
	Chennai: Kevin Pietersen on Monday admitted that Sachin Tendulkar took the match away from them. He batted like a superstar, the England captain said.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The gains from the Test         
	I think the way (Andrew) Strauss batted was magnificent, the way the openers started the Test match was fantastic Collingwood as well. Graeme Swann on his debut put in a pretty good performance. Freddie tried his heart out again. And to control the Test match for 70 per cent of the time and then unfortunately to miss out is a pretty bitter pill to swallow. In terms of my performance, I miscued a pull shot and I missed a straight ball, pretty simple.         
	The bitter pill part         
	Positives too can be found in the way we played Test match cricket over the past five days. Especially after what happened in Mumbai a couple of weeks ago Obviously that was not in the script.         
	And for both teams to come out and play Test match cricket and to put on a performance like this I think we can be really proud.                 
	Was it the exceptional batting or poor bowling responsible for Englands defeat?         
	Who can write Sachin Tendulkars script any better? The man from Mumbai came in and scored a sensational hundred today. He batted like a superstar. We tried everything we could do but unfortunately He played well.         
	If slow batting by England cost them the match         
	I think our batters have done a fantastic job and got us into a position from where we should have won the Test match.         
	Sehwag and Sachins batting         
	I think the way Sehwag started things off on Sunday and the way Sachin went about his business today I mean if he had got out early who knows what would have happened. I just think Sachin played a super, super knock just like the man. Hes a super bloke and played a fantastic day of cricket today.         
	Yuvrajs batting         
	Once you get a wicket, weve seen on numerous occasions that a couple of wickets fall and we wanted to attack Yuvraj, wanted to try and get under his skin but he played pretty well today as well. He didnt allow much to get to him today.         
	Thoughts on Mohali         
	We can sleep with knowing 70 per cent of this Test was ours. The last time we were here we drew the series in the last Test match. Weve got one Test match to go and well try and draw the series.         
	Any post-mortem         
	We are not going to use any excuses for losing or not putting on a real good performance. But I think our lads put on a fantastic performance over the five days. I am so, so proud of that personally.         
	His injury         
	Ive got a fractured rib. I fractured my rib the day before the Cuttack game. I am alright I can deal with it.

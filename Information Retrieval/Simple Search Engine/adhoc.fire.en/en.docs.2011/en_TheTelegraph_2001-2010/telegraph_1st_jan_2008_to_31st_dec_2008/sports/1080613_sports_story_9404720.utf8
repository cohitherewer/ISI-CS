The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan manager asked to explain
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pakistan manager asked to explain
                      
	Karachi: Livid after India thrashed Pakistan in the ongoing tri-series in Bangladesh, PCB chief Nasim Ashraf has shot off an email to team manager Talat Ali, seeking an immediate explanation on issues including team selection, Shoaib Maliks captaincy and the role played by Australian coach Geoff Lawson.         
	In a related event, the PCB on Thursday sacked former Test player Saleem Altaf from the post of director, special projects, on charges of leaking the confidential email to the local media.         
	In a clear indication that the thumping defeat, Indias biggest win over their arch-rivals, has not gone down well with the PCB, Ashraf has asked Ali to clarify within the next 24 hours.         
	Tuesday nights performance against India in which we lost by over 100 runs was embarrassing. It is not a question of losing a match but our overall performance and the lack of resolve and commitment bothered me, Ashraf wrote in his email.         
	I am writing this to you in your capacity as chairman of the tour selection committee with copies to Malik and Lawson. Please discuss these points and give us your considered response within the next 24 hours so that timely action can be taken before the next match against India, Ashraf wrote in the email which was widely reported in the local media on Thursday.         
	In a later development, manager Ali accused the media for blowing up the email issue.         
	It happens every now and then. There is nothing to it. You (media) are making it a big issue. This is not the first time that the chairman has written to the team. He has the right to ask me anything and it is not abnormal, Ali said.         
	He admitted that Pakistan had an off day in all departments of the game on Tuesday. Who said batting is our weak point? Lets admit that India bowled well, lets give credit to them. However, we are admitting that we did not bowl well, he said.         
	The PCB chairman lashed out at the tour selection committees decision to drop spinning allrounder Fawad Alam and play pacer Rao Iftikhar and noted that playing four fast bowlers was a folly.         
	He also questioned why Malik did not bowl against India as a second spinner, when he was told that the captain was 100 per cent fit.         
	Ashraf criticised Kamran Akmal for spilling a Virender Sehwag edge and still claiming it a catch.         
	This is unsporting behaviour but perhaps one has to give him the benefit of the doubt. But I do not want such behaviour from our players. We ought to be looking at playing another wicketkeeper, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Altaf was accused of leaking Ashrafs email to Ali in which the PCB chief had lambasted the Pakistan team. A PCB official said Altaf has been removed from his position with immediate effect.         
	Sources said the board suspected that Altaf was behind the leak and other sensitive information in recent days and board mandarins were unhappy with the situation.         
	Altaf said he was disappointed and upset. They have given me nothing in writing. They just told me you are sacked and leave the office. My driver came to the stadium and they seized the car by force and took the keys and told the security personnel to show me the way out. Is this the way to treat former players? he asked.                 (PTI)

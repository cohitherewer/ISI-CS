The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Have learnt lessons: Anil
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Have learnt lessons: Anil
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                       
	Ahmedabad: Anil Kumble cut a brave face, insisting that the team will come back in Kanpur to level the series.         
	There will be pressure in Kanpur but we have been in similar situations before and bounced back. We have the same players in the dressing room. So I dont see why we cant do that again in the final Test. The record in Kanpur is also in our favour, the India captain told a news conference after the hosts lost to South Africa by an innings and 90 runs at the Motera on Saturday.         
	Kumble also praised Sourav Gangulys second innings knock of 87, lamenting the left-hander should have made into a hundred.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Having lost the Test inside three days         
	It was very difficult to come back after we were bundled out for 76 in the first innings. We did the right thing by getting their top four wickets. However, the partnership between A.B. de Villiers and Jacques Kallis was crucial for their win. A wicket at that stage could have made a huge difference.         
	On the decision to bat first         
	I dont think the decision backfired on us. The wicket behaved on expected lines with the new ball throughout the match and its only a matter of adjusting to it.         
	The batting collapse         
	It was just one of those days when you didnt convert your start into a meaningful end. In the first innings nothing had worked out for us. We batted much better in the second innings. Our top order got the starts but could not convert them to big scores. We will have to do that in the final Test.         
	Any lack of planning?         
	Absolutely not. Looking back at the first Test in Chennai, we got 600-plus run. We also had the necessary preparation for this match.         
	Any lack of effort from the bowlers?         
	The answer will be the same: absolutely not. They did try their best and only the result was not there. There was 100 per cent effort by our bowlers.         
	Pressure of levelling the series in Kanpur         
	There will be pressure in Kanpur but we have been in similar situations before and bounced back. We have the same players in the dressing room. So I dont see why we cant do that again in the final Test. The record in Kanpur is also in our favour We have learnt our lessons and will certainly go there with a positive frame of mind.         
	If the pitches need to be prepared keeping in mind home advantage         
	I dont give instructions on preparation of wickets. We play on whatever wickets are given to us.         
	Sourav Gangulys 87 in the second innings         
	Its good to see batsmen coming into form before the final Test. It would have nicer had he got a hundred. Its good take some positive like this to Kanpur.

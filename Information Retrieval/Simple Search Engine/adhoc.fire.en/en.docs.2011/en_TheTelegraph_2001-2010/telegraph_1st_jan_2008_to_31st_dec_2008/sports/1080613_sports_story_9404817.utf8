The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lawson should go: Intikhab 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Lawson should go: Intikhab 
                  Intikhab Alam                     
	Karachi: Former Test captain Intikhab Alam believes Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson has failed to deliver and should go, while Zaheer Abbas reckons the very idea of having a foreign coach is not going to work here.         
	Stung after India crushed the Shoaib Malik-led Pakistani side by 140 runs in the ongoing tri-series in Bangladesh, Intikhab said in Lahore that Lawson had disappointed and should go.         
	Lawsons role as a coach was nowhere to be seen in this match. He has failed to give the impression that he can deliver the goods, Intikhab said.         
	Lawson was appointed last August after the death of Bob Woolmer during the World Cup in the West Indies. He has been given an initial contract of two years and told to win a major title for Pakistan in this period after which his contract would be reviewed.         
	Intikhab, however, does not see that happening. The defeat to India was very disappointing and I am sorry to say the way we played it appeared as if we had no gameplan or inkling of what to do. If the seniors are not performing they should be dropped and new players be given a chance, Intikhab said.         
	Former captain Zaheer Abbas also criticised the poor performance of the team and wondered if the concept of having a foreigner as coach would work for the side.         
	Having defeated weak teams like Zimbabwe and Bangladesh we were happy but the side was exposed by the Indians, he said.         
	Zaheer said Pakistan could only rate themselves and claim a top position in world cricket by playing against top teams like India, Australia, South Africa and England.         
	The Indians outplayed us in every department of the game and the worrying factor is that we never looked like we were in the match. We never put up a good fight, he rued.         
	They are glaring problems in the team and the captaincy has added the pressure on Shoaib Malik. We keep on saying this but the board and team management believes we are looking for jobs. The truth is we are hurt by such defeats and we care for the well being of Pakistan cricket, he said.

Gap too wide for women | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gap too wide for women
  - Testosterone, to a large extent, gives the men an edge         GINA KOLATA                              
	Beijing: No matter what happens in the mens marathon here Sunday, one thing is all but certain. The winner will run the 26.2-mile course faster than the winner of the womens marathon last Sunday.         
	The woman who won, Constantina Tomescu of Romania, was fast, of course, finishing the race in 2 hours 26 minutes 44 seconds  more than a minute ahead of the second-place finisher. But for a variety of intrinsic biological reasons, the best women can never run as fast as the best men, exercise researchers say.         
	Women are slower than men in running, in swimming, in cycling. Whether it is a 100m race on the track or a marathon, a 200m butterfly swim or a 10km marathon swim, the pattern holds.         
	And even though some scientists once predicted that women would eventually close the gender gap in elite performances  it was proposed that all they needed was more experience, better training and stronger coaching  that idea is now largely discredited, at least for Olympic events. Researchers say there is no one physiological reason for the gap, although there is a common biological thread.         
	To a large extent, its a matter of testosterone, said Dr Benjamin Levine, director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at Presbyterian Hospital and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Thats why systematic doping of women is even more effective than systematic doping of men. Thats why the East German women were so much more successful than the East German men. The hormone affects everything from muscle size and strength to the size of the heart to the amount of oxygen-carrying blood cells in the body to the percentage of fat on an athletes body. Every one of those effects gives men a performance advantage.         
	Testosterone, Levine said, gives men what he calls a bigger and better-fuelled engine. Their skeletal muscles, which do the work during exercise, are bigger. And their hearts, which provide fuel for the work, are bigger, too.         
	It is not that every man is inherently better than every woman. A very lean, well-trained woman will be faster than a less lean, less fit man, he said. But that is not the issue in the Olympics, where the men and women are among the worlds best.         
	Even when scientists correct for the fact that men are bigger than women  and bigger animals or humans have bigger hearts  mens hearts are still larger than the hearts of women. Exercise makes hearts grow, but male hearts grow more than female hearts, Levine has found.                 
	He recently conducted a study that recruited sedentary men and women and trained them to run a marathon. At the start of the study, Levine said, the mens hearts and the womens hearts were the same size relative to the size of their bodies. Gram for gram, they had the same size hearts, he said. We trained them for over a year. Heartbeat for heartbeat, they had the same training.         
	And the result? The womens hearts did not grow anywhere near as big as the mens hearts, Levine said.         
	Another factor comes into play. Because men have more testosterone, they have less fat and more muscle than women. Thats extra weight women have to carry, said Hirofumi Tanaka, an exercise researcher at the University of Texas. It inevitably takes its toll, slowing women down. Even the leanest women, like elite marathon runners, have a body fat measurement that is around 8 per cent, compared with 4 per cent for elite male marathoners. Unless women are doping and fundamentally changing their biology, they are left with body fat percentages that may be twice as much as mens, Levine said.         
	Female athletes and their coaches are well aware of the performance penalty that extra fat confers.         
	Coaches tell them that if they want to be successful, they have to be leaner, Levine said. Its a constant struggle for female athletes who are in sports where being lean is a determinant of success.         
	But fat, researchers said, is only part of the explanation.         
	Another hindrance to women is their lower red blood cell counts; their haemoglobin levels tend to be 10 to 15 perc ent lower than those of men. The more red cells, the more oxygen-carrying haemoglobin is in the blood. And the more haemoglobin, the more oxygen reaching exercising muscles.         
	Women lose blood when they menstruate, but they also do not make as many red blood cells. Testosterone increases red blood cell production, said Dr Mark Tarnopolsky, an exercise researcher at McMaster University in Ontario.         
	Testosterone also changes the makeup of muscles. Women, with their lower testosterone levels, end up with a smaller proportion of Type 2 muscle fibres, which are used to generate speed and power and strength, Tarnopolsky said.         
	Nonetheless, researchers expect womens performances to improve with time and with experience. No one thinks women  or men, for that matter  have reached a performance ceiling. But, Levine notes, training, talent and a competitive drive can take women only so far. There are some biological factors that cannot be overcome, Levine said.

            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar, on the verge of becoming the highest run-scorer in Tests, slipped further in the ICC rankings for batsmen, dropping a spot to 24th, according to an ICC media release on Tuesday.         
	Tendulkar is just 15 runs away from breaking Brian Laras world record of 11,953 Test runs.         
	V. V. S Laxman (14th) was the lone Indian batsman to move up while Virender Sehwag (11th) and Rahul Dravid (18th) slip.         
	Australias Michael Hussey returned to the top after scoring 177 in the drawn Bangalore Test against India, including a 146 in the first innings.         
	Hussey was placed third before this match, behind Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka and Shivnarine Chanderpaul of the West Indies.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting stayed fourth despite scoring his maiden Test century in India.         
	Opener Matthew Hayden slipped two places. He now lies in the ninth spot with Aussie vice-captain Michael Clarke further back in the 15th position.         
	In the bowling charts, Zaheer Khan, Man of the Match in the Bangalore Test, gained seven places and is now 11th in the rankings.         
	India skipper Anil Kumble lost eight places, plummeting from the 10th position to 18th. The India captain bowled 51 overs in Bangalore without picking up a wicket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England are playing Jekyll and Hyde cricket
                                                                                                                                                                                                       England are playing Jekyll and Hyde cricket
                    Guest Column    Geoff Boycott          
	Andrew Strauss century on Monday was a perfect innings from an opening batsman. I have to admit, I doubted whether Strauss would ever recapture his best form after the black period he went through last summer. But he was brilliant here; without him, there was no way England could have got those runs.         
	What impresses me is that since coming back into the side, Strauss hasnt just reverted to his old way of batting. He used to stand still and play shots, and if he was in nick, he got a lot of boundaries. But that form slump has forced him to change his game  for the better. Now he goes back and across just before the bowler releases the ball, and he has a better grasp of where his off-stump is.         
	By refusing to follow the ball, Strauss frustrates the bowlers into bowling too straight at him. Then he picks off runs calmly on the on-side. He is using a shorter back-lift now, allowing him more time to let the ball come to him, so that he plays it closer to his body and with more control.         
	England have been crying out for a top-order batsman to stay in and give the innings a platform. If Strauss sticks to his plan, he will make bowlers hate him, which is your job as an opener. Yes, he has sacrificed some ability to drive off the front foot through the off-side but this is a much safer way of playing against the new ball. Batting isnt about how many boundaries you hit, its about how many runs you make. Thats a lesson I took on board early on.         
	Strauss was always going to be the key on Monday, because he was the only left-handed batsman still standing, and so had the best chance against Daniel Vettori. Strauss could play Vettori as an off-spinner, using his pad and body as a second line of defence, and deflecting the ball with the spin behind square on the on-side.         
	Together with Monty Panesar, Strauss worked wonders to haul England back into this match. Mind you, they should never have been in trouble in the first place. In the first innings, they were unbelievably flat and lacklustre and they let New Zealand dictate the course of the game.         
	You can never take sport for granted but it would be nice if England could start to produce a little consistency. At the moment theyre playing Jekyll and Hyde cricket: youre never quite sure which team will turn up. England cannot afford these sloppy spells if they are to beat South Africa later in the summer.         
	Darren Gough announced on Monday that he would be retiring at the end of the season. At Yorkshire, we will miss him terribly, but we also know that he has done a fantastic job for the club. When I recommended Darren to the board as Yorkshire captain, a lot of people doubted whether he was knowledgeable enough for such a big responsibility People tend to underestimate him but Darren is one of the best death bowlers I have seen in one-day cricket.         
	Darren is a winner. He has a big heart, smiles all the time and shows his enjoyment of the game. For England, Darren was the heartbeat of the side, the go-to man in times of difficulty. He always has the stomach for the fight  a rare quality. Thats why the Aussies love him; he never gives up. I am proud to have spent a little time working with him, and I hope he ends his career in style this summer.

	New Delhi: Prakash Amritraj on Friday became the first Indian to reach the semi-finals of an ATP Tour singles event in a decade after his straight-set victory over compatriot Rohan Bopanna in the Hall of Fame tennis championships in Newport.         
	The last Indian to feature in an ATP Tour semi-final was Leander Paes who won the title in the same competition in July, 1998.         
	Wild card Prakash achieved the feat by ending qualifier Bopannas dream run at the $385,000 event with a 6-4, 6-3 victory in an all-Indian quarter final.         
	Bopanna had been in fine form in the tournament, having stunned top seed American Mardy Fish in the second round before setting up date with Prakash.         
	Interestingly, Prakashs father Vijay had won the same tournament thrice  in 1976, 1980 and 1984.         
	Prakash will now take on Canadian Frank Dancevi in the semi-final after the seventh seed upset fourth seed Russian Igor Kunitsyn 7-5. 6-3 in the other quarter final.         
	Seeded fourth, Bopanna and his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi advanced to the semi-finals after beating South African Kevin Anderson and American James Cerretanu 7-6 (4), 3-6, 10-7.

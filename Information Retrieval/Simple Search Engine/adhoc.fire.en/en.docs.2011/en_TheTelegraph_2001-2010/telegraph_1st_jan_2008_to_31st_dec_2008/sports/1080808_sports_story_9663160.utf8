The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough draw for Sania
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tough draw for Sania
                      
	Beijing: A tough Olympic draw pitted Sania Mirza against her Czech nemesis Iveta Benesova in the first round and even if she clears this hurdle, greater danger awaits for the Indian in the second round, where former world No.1 Venus Williams is likely to cross swords with her.         
	The mens doubles pair of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, however, got a better deal with the Indian Express duo kicking off their campaign against French pair of Gael Monfils and Gilles Simons on Sunday.         
	Unfortunately, Sania was not lucky enough.         
	In fact, clearing the first round hurdle in singles would prove a vigorous task for world No. 60, who has not been in her best form.         
	Past records also provide no hope, as Sanias all three previous attempts to crack the Benesova code came to a zilch with the Czech, currently world No. 56, having the last laugh on all three occasions incidentally all via three-setters.         
	The Sania-Benesova duel dates back to 2005 in Los Angeles where the Czech won it 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 and history was repeated next year at sHertogenbosch.         
	This year, they met in Stockholm and though Sania seized early initiative by winning the first set, the Czech came back from behind to maintain a 3-0 lead in the head-to-head count.

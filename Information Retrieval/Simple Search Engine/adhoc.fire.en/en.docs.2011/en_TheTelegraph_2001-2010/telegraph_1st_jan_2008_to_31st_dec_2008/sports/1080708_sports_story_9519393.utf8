                                                                                                                                                                                                     IWF divided over sacking coaches
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian weightlifting scenario turned murkier on Monday when a section of the officials in the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) accused the office bearers of trying to pass the buck on to the coaches for doping.         
	The accusation came a day after the IWF decided to dismiss the entire panel of coaches soon after the Beijing Olympics. The IWF secretary, B. R. Gulati, has already written a letter to Director General, Sports Authority of India (SAI), informing him of the decision. The four coaches who have been asked to leave after the Olympics are  PS Sandhu, Hansa Sharma, Tamil Selvan and Amarnath.         
	While Gulati said it was the first step towards cleaning the image of weightlifting in the country, a senior IWF official termed it as an attempt to put the blame on the coaches for all the drug problems in the sport.         
	The IWF is certainly in a difficult situation now, the official said. The government has already asked the federation to clean the sport of doping as soon as possible. The decision to throw out the coaches is only an attempt to please the government.

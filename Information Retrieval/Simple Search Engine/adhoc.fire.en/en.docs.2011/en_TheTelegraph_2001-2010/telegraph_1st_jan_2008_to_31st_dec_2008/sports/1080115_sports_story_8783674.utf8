                                                   Were desperately keen to get the 17th win: Gilchrist

 - We want to keep playing the way weve been playing for quite a while, asserts Australias vice-captain 
   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
              
	Perth: Australias vice-captain, Adam Gilchrist, had a fairly lengthy session with the media on Monday afternoon  much before the Brad Hogg development. Later, he briefly spoke to The Telegraph separately. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
    
	On whether, with so much happening in the past week, theres been time to reflect on the record-equalling 16 consecutive Test wins 
    
	Not really We had five days off (from after the SCG Test to assembling here) and each one did his own thing We havent sat down and had a discussion but, obviously, every player is happy to have helped equal the record I hadnt thought then (in 2001) that the record could be equalled. 
    
	On whether the controversies have taken the gloss off that achievement 
    
	Its been a bit frustrating and disappointing to see so little written about the quality of cricket at the SCG It was an amazing Test, which got decided in the last few overs But we arent going to dwell on all that The chance is there for a 17th win in-a-row If it happens, well be thrilled to have played a part. 
    
	On the mood ahead of the third Test 
    
	Im sure therell be a bit of fire in everyones belly, but Im confident both teams are professional enough to know that once the first ball is bowled, then its into the cricket mode Were desperately keen to get the 17th win Were also keen to win the series Weve already retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, but its not a dead Rubber 
    
	On his first thoughts when word got around that Team India could abandon the tour (after the three-Test ban on Harbhajan Singh) 
    
	(Pauses) Dont remember What I do remember is Ricky (Ponting) commenting that it would be a strange decision That it would be a big move based on one verdict Look, its not for me to tell Indian cricket what to do or what not to do. 
    
	On Sundays team meeting in the presence of facilitator Ray McLean 
    
	It was a continuation of the discussions weve been having from before the start of this season Ray talked very little of the on-field stuff, more about the direction the team is taking The team environment For the players, it was an opportunity to off-load Nobody really did Ricky, as usual, showed leadership and spoke about this week and of putting things behind us It wasnt a crisis meeting as it was scheduled three months ago. 
    
	On former captain Mark Taylor also having been present at that meeting 
    
	Mark has a variety of roles Hes with the media (Channel 9) Hes on the board of Cricket Australia He contributed with a few comments, but there was no formal address and he didnt walk in with a bullet-pointed agenda. Lets say he made a nice contribution. 
    
	[Incidentally, Ponting and Co. were shown footage of where their conduct went wrong in the SCG Test.] 
    
	On whether, instead of the International Cricket Council (ICC) sending Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle to help in sorting things out, the senior pros on both sides couldve taken the lead 
    
	The ICC is the governing body It has the discretion The seniors definitely have a role to play, but we were in different places and didnt catch up with each other I dont know about the Indians, but we want to keep playing the way weve been playing for quite a while. Well continue to strive to be the best at everything we do Its because we strive that weve been able to dominate world cricket Indeed, well continue to get more things right than we get wrong Maybe it hasnt reached a point where weve got to sit across a table and have a discussion Were all big and can get along with it Weve let off steam, theyve let off theirs Now, its time to focus on the next Test. 
    
	On the responsibility he has to ensure that the upcoming Test is only remembered for cricket and not anything else 
    
	Ill continue to play the way Ive played right through my career 
    
	On the issues between the teams 
    
	Oh, I dont want to go back (in time) and spend another day discussing them. 
    
	On Team India captain Anil Kumble 
    
	Anils a fine man and, looking from the outside, a fine leader I cant remember the match, but I remember having called to wish him when he got his 500th Test wicket That shows just how highly we respect him. Hes been a great cricketer, somebody Ive admired and the team has admired. I dont need to tell him anything, hes more experienced than I am. 
    
	On the Waca wicket 
    
	Havent had a close look at it Dont tend to do that too far away from a game Its suited for the faster bowlers (After a pause) The Waca has the Honours Board and players do get inspired Its exciting to talk of past achievements. 
    
	On what catches batsmen off guard at the Waca 
    
	The pace and bounce The extra pace can shock you a little bit It had died down a bit, but its back to its usual pace and bounce Wed bowled India out pretty comprehensively in a one-dayer four years ago and well be looking to open up any scars or wounds they may have had that day 
    
	On Matthew Haydens chances of playing 
    
	More than 50-50 Its a frustrating injury for him because theres so much that he can do at 100 per cent Its the few little things where he feels the hamstring injury I think Matt will be put through a fitness test at the last minute, allowing maximum time to recover. 
    
	On Chris Rogers, the standby for Hayden 
    
	(Grins) Hes not the most elegant batsman, by way of his shot-selection and so on But hes a very, very effective cricketer He knows his game and has had a great first-class career He may look like a nicker and a nudger, but theres a lot more to his game. 
    
	On the strong possibility of quick Shaun Tait making the XI (at Hoggs expense) 
    
	Hes striving to make an impact at the Test level If he does get the nod then hell (make an impact) With his pace, he could play a big part. 
    
	On 94 Test appearances without a break 
    
	Its nice to have played 94 straight Tests Justin Langer once said the greatest characteristic of a champion was longevity Of coming through different conditions over a period of time Its a nice little something to take home. 
    
	On what made him walk during the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka 
    
	It was a personal thing Wed all be critical of the umpires, but I thought lets make it easier for them by walking when I nicked Its different from my role as a keeper, where I may appeal in the belief that contact has been made Of course, by walking, I dont wish to put down others In fact, in that semi-final, I didnt wake up saying Id walk if the opportunity arose It just happened in Port Elizabeth. 
    
	Finally, on being a role model 
    
	Its nice that Im seen that way Nice that the way I play keeps getting appreciated

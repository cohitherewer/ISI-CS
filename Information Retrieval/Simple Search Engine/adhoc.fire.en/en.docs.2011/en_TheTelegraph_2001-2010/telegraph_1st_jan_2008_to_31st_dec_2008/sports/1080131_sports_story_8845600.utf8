	London: Arsenal beat Newcastle United 3-0 for the second time in four days on Tuesday to edge ahead of Manchester United in the Premier League title race. 
    
	Goals from Emmanuel Adebayor, Mathieu Flamini and Cesc Fabregas underlined Arsenals superiority and took the Gunners three points above champions United, who have a game in hand, against Portsmouth. 
    
	The three other matches on Tuesday all involved teams fighting to stay in the top flight. Sunderland gave their survival hopes a huge boost, beating Birmingham City 2-0 at home to move out of the relegation zone and up into 14th place. 
    
	Wigan Athletic drop into the bottom three after losing 0-1 at Middlesbrough while Fulham stay second from bottom after a 0-0 draw at fellow strugglers Bolton Wanderers.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Samuels faces a 2-year ban  
	Port of Spain: West Indies cricketer Marlon Samuels has been found liable of one of the two bribery charges and faces a two-year ban from international cricket. The WICB found sufficient evidence to charge Samuels for allegedly passing on team information to Indian bookie Mukesh Kochar during the first ODI between the West Indies and India in Nagpur on January 21 last year.  
	The West Indies allrounder now faces a two-year ban from international cricket. Samuels was also suspended from bowling in January after independent analysis of his action revealed his off-break and faster deliveries exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance permitted under regulations.         
	Purple cap         
	Calcutta: The Indian Premier League will award Purple cap to the bowler with the most cumulative wickets to his name on each day of the season, says A Staff Reporter. The cap will be worn by that bowler in the field.         
	At the end of the season, the holder will win the honour of being called the Winner of the Purple Cap 2008 and will receive recognition on the final day. In the event of a tie at any given time, the holder will be determined by superior economy rate.         
	The bowler who wins the right to call himself Purple Cap Winner 2008 will be proud of the achievement, since the prevailing thought is that Twenty20 is a batsmans game and the IPL is blessed with many of the worlds greatest batsmen, said Lalit Modi, chairman and commissioner of the IPL.         
	Clarke status         
	Brisbane: Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke may miss next weeks first Test against West Indies following the death of his fiancees father. Clarke was granted compassionate leave last week to allow him to stay at home with model Lara Bingle during her fathers illness. Graham Bingle died from cancer on Saturday at a Sydney hospital. His funeral is due to be held later this week.         
	Australia tour         
	 Sydney: Australia will play ODIs against Ireland and Scotland in the next two years, the first time the World Cup champions have played official games against associate nations outside ICC events. CA said Monday that Ireland, who upset Pakistan and Bangladesh en route to the Super Eights stage of the World Cup, will host Australia in June 2010 when Australia begins a one-day tour of England. Australia will visit Edinburgh on August 28, 2009 for an ODI against Scotland.         
	Pak security         
	 Karachi: The PCB Monday said it will work jointly with the ICC to finalise the security arrangements for the Champions Trophy to be held here in September. The security arrangements will be approved jointly by the ICC and the PCB, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said. The ICC, in its executive board meet on June 29 in Dubai, will finalise the issue of hosting the tournament in Pakistan.

  - Terry sent off vs Everton 
            MARK OGDEN                                
	Referee Phil Dowd prompted fury from Everton and Chelsea as his decisions to dismiss John Terry in the first half, followed by his ruling out of an apparent late Everton winner from Steven Pienaar, marked the 0-0 draw at Goodison Park. The result will only serve to leave Sir Alex Ferguson smiling.         
	Chelseas failure to reclaim top spot from Liverpool leaves them just six points clear of the champions.         
	Evertons hopes of ending a 20-game run without a win against Chelsea were hardly helped by the injury crisis that has left David Moyes without a recognised forward.         
	Had Ashley Cole done better with a second-minute half-volley that forced goalkeeper Tim Howard into an improvised near-post save, Chelsea would have had the advantage of a one-goal cushion against a team that had won just once in front of their own supporters so far this season.         
	But Howards save denied Chelsea and Moyess team used it as a springboard from which they dominated the early exchanges. Cahills endeavour against Terry and Alex resulted in him creating a long-range effort for Phil Neville, whose 25-yard shot brought an important save from Petr Cech.         
	Joe Cole and Frank Lampard did their best to create an opening for Nicolas Anelka, but on more than one occasion, careless play by the French forward saw him trigger the linesmans flag for offside. But with Everton denying Chelsea the upper hand that they have held on their travels this season, Terrys attempt to assert his teams authority went wrong after 35 minutes when his high-risk challenge on Leon Osman resulted in the England captain missing the ball and catching the Everton midfielder high on his trailing leg. Terrys chances of winning the ball were minimal, so he could have no complaints when Dowd showed the red card.         
	Scolari showed no such restraint when he followed Dowd down the tunnel at half-time, with witnesses reporting that the Brazilian pursued the referee, shouting Are you afraid? Are you afraid?, apparently questioning Dowds sensitivity to the angry reaction of the Goodison crowd after Terrys challenge.         
	Compromised by the paucity of their attacking options, however, Everton were unable to mount the kind of sustained pressure required against 10 men and, although they dominated possession, chances were few and far between. Only a far-post Fellaini header troubled Cech as Everton attempted to make the breakthrough.         
	And with Didier Drogba having replaced Anelka at the interval, the threat posed by Chelseas moody Ivorian could not be ignored by Moyess defenders. While hardly throwing caution to the wind, Everton found the courage to raise their game by a notch in the closing stages.         
	He reacted brilliantly to keep the ball out when Lampard deflected Tony Hibberts cross close to the top corner and performed more heroics seconds later when denying Joleon Lescott. And when Everton did manage to beat Cech, Pienaars inability to beat the offside trap, left Dowd with no option but to disallow the 84th-minute effort.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shift in stand, BCCI will soon talk to ICL
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shift in stand, BCCI will soon talk to ICL
    - A dialogue is definitely a positive step: Kapil Dev           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kapil Dev                                 
	Calcutta: In a dramatic departure from its hostile position, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has informed the world body that it would soon hold discussions with the outlawed Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	That was conveyed to the International Cricket Council (ICC) by the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, in Dubai on Tuesday and should come as great news for such promising players like Bengals Avishek Jhunjhunwala.         
	According to top sources of The Telegraph, both in the ICC and the BCCI, a recent one-on-one between former BCCI chief Sharad Pawar and the ICL promoter, Subhas Chandra (of Zee), led to this change in stance.         
	Pawar, by the way, is the ICCs vice-president.         
	The Executive Board was about to discuss the ICLs application for approval when Manohar suggested that the discussion be put on hold till his own meeting with the ICL... The Executive Board agreed and one understands Manohar will be having that meeting sooner rather than later, is what a top source said.         
	Indeed, the BCCI and the ICL could meet as soon as within a week.         
	David Morgan, the ICC president, had given time to Chandra (for a presentation) in the lead-up to the Executive Board meeting. Manohar, somebody very close to Pawar, had been comfortable with their interaction.         
	The BCCI, it may be recalled, has banned anybody associated with the ICL from having anything to do with what is regarded as official cricket. Not just players, but coaches and officials have also been blacklisted.         
	Its not a question of being happy, but I accept that only a dialogue can help sort out misunderstandings... Its good when people talk and when the problem is in India, we Indians alone should settle it... Weve never wanted a confrontation, remarked ICL chairman Kapil Dev.         
	Speaking from Dubai minutes before boarding a flight for Hyderabad, the icon added: I didnt come here to meet anybody from the ICC or the BCCI, I came for work related to Khushi (a charitable organisation)... Ive all along maintained that the players should not suffer... A dialogue is definitely a positive step...         
	Kapil declined to say anything more. Let the BCCI first invite us... Let us begin to talk.         
	According to an ICC statement, Manohar has agreed to provide the Executive Board with a full written report of discussions with the ICL.         
	Many so-called pundits had forecast that the ICL would be a one-season (2007-08) wonder, but season No.2 has just got under way. With an additional team  Dhaka Warriors  to boot.         
	The officially-approved Indian Premier League (IPL) had a much bigger impact, phenomenal actually, but it had a million and more advantages. The IPL, in fact, was announced after the ICL.         
	Both, of course, want to make the most of the Twenty20 boom.

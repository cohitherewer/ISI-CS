The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | More trouble awaits Asif
                                                                                                                                                                                                     More trouble awaits Asif
                      
	Karachi: Mohammed Asif could be in more trouble after he returns home from detention in Dubai as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is planning to suspend the embattled pacer and institute an inquiry against him under World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) regulations.         
	Asif was detained in Dubai on June 1 for alleged drug possession while returning home after playing in the Indian Premier League.         
	PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said on Monday that the board would carry out an inquiry against Asif once he returns home.         
	It is too early to say anything but yes, our anti-doping regulations comply with the Wada and in this particular case also, we have to follow their regulations, Ashraf said.         
	We are hopeful he will be released and allowed to return home but since it is an incident involving drugs, no matter how small the quantity is, he could be suspended from playing cricket until the inquiry is conducted against him, he added.         
	I dont know if they decide to deport him or just send him back home. But at the moment our first priority is that he is cleared of this case which is bad for Pakistan cricket, Ashraf said.

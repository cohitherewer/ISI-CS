The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We wont rest Yuvi: Dhoni 
                                                     We wont rest Yuvi: Dhoni 
            A CORRESPONDENT             Yuvraj Singh                           
	Adelaide: Mahendra Singh Dhoni defended his out-of-form deputy on Sunday, saying Yuvraj Singh would be his choice for the rest of the tri-series. Well not rest him for now. Hell be part of the team and hell play in all the games, India captain told a post match news conference.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	Were you disappointed with the way Yuvraj got out?         
	The shot was on. Two-three overs before that he had hit a six off a similar delivery. The bad balls are there to be punished. If you dont play your shots you dont score runs. But that wasnt the turning point. The turning point was my run out. It was bad reaction from Rohit (Sharma). Even with the cramps I could have made it easily.         
	Is there any possibility of resting the out-of-form Yuvraj Singh?         
	Well not rest him now. Hell be part of the team and hell play in all the games.         
	Any strategy behind going in with five bowlers?         
	Viru (Virender Sehwag) wasnt 100 per cent fit. Besides, I was very keen to go in with five bowlers in the next game against Sri Lanka. I thought why not use the strategy in this game.         
	Were you missing an extra batsman?         
	Thats always an area for concern. If you play with four bowlers youll ask me if I can go in with five. Now that Im playing five bowlers you are thinking why not include an extra batsman. Its more about pluses and minuses.         
	How concerned are you with the middle order?         
	Its not a computer where you program a software and feed into it. Today, the batsmen needed to be more careful about their shot selection... Lack of patience could be another factor. They need to stick to their style and play responsibly.         
	Will Sehwag be available in the next match?         
	Viru should be fit, thats what Ive got to say till now. The report that Ive got from John (Gloster) says he should be fit for the game against Sri Lanka.         
	Why was Irfan Pathan sent up the order?         
	If you send Irfan at No. 3 it balances the side. With Gautam (Gambhir) and Sachin (Tendulkar) opening the innings, Irfan batting at No. 3 gives balance to the rest of the order and we can also bat deep. Irfan at No. 7 or 8 doesnt make too much of a difference. Its all about using the talent youve got and at times you have to do things in a different way.         
	How is your leg now?         
	Its not really a serious injury Its not a tear. Hopefully I will be there in the next game.         
	Wouldnt it be a better option to push yourself up the order?         
	You need some support down the order. With Yuvi not being in really great nick, the middle order comes under a lot of pressure and you need a bit of experience there. Give the newcomers the opportunity to bat at No. 3 or 4. When they are set, I can push myself up.

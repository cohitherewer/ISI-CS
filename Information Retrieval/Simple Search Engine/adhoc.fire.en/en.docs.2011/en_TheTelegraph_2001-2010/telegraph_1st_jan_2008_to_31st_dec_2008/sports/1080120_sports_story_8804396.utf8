                                                   United retain top spot

           
	London: Manchester United hung on to top spot in the Premier League with late goals from Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo sealing a 2-0 victory at Reading on Saturday. 
    
	United failed to put any daylight between themselves and Arsenal, however, with Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor scoring twice as the Gunners returned to form with a 3-0 rout of Fulham at Craven Cottage. 
    
	Third-placed Chelsea rode their luck to beat Birmingham City 1-0 away thanks to Claudio Pizarros late header. They stay four points behind the top two who have 54 points from 23 matches. 
    
	There is a yawning gap to fourth-placed Liverpool who are facing a stiff battle for fourth spot with Everton, Aston Villa and Manchester City. All four clubs are on 39 points. 
    
	Liverpool, who have only played 21 matches, are at Villa on Monday, while Everton travel to Wigan Athletic on Sunday when Manchester City host West Ham United. 
    
	While the top three all won, the bottom three all lost. Fulhams defeat makes them increasingly likely to join Derby County through the relegation trapdoor. 
    
	Bottom club Derby took the lead at Portsmouth before a Benjani Mwaruwari hattrick ended a nine-hour goal famine for Pompey at home to seal a 3-1 win. 
    
	Sunderland stayed in the bottom three after a 2-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur, for whom Robbie Keane scored his 100th goal. Middlesbrough drew 1-1 at Blackburn Rovers. 
    
	United were stifled by Reading on the opening day of the season when they drew 0-0 at Old Trafford and goals were at a premium again, although there was no lack of chances. 
    
	The countrys top scorer Ronaldo wasted several chances for United while Reading also had opportunities, the best of which fell to Dave Kitson who lobbed wide when through on goal.

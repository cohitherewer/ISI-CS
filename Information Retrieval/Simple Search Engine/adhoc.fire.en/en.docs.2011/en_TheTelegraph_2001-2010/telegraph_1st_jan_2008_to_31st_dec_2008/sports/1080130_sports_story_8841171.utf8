	Adelaide: The former Board of Control for Cricket in India president, Inderjit Singh Bindra, has confirmed having been shortlisted for the chief executives post at the International Cricket Council (ICC). 
    
	Yes, Im on the shortlist, but havent made up my mind... Doing something globally will be challenging, but the family has to relocate to Dubai and thats something which is being looked at, Bindra told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 
    
	Incumbent Malcolm Speeds term ends in June and Bindra must decide by the first week of February, before the next board meeting of the ICC. 
    
	If Bindra agrees, then hell have to work under Englands David Morgan for the first two years of his three-year tenure. Sharad Pawar, afterall, will only sit in the presidents chair from 2010. 
    
	A one-time bureaucrat, Bindra heads the Punjab Cricket Association, which is among the bestrun bodies back home.

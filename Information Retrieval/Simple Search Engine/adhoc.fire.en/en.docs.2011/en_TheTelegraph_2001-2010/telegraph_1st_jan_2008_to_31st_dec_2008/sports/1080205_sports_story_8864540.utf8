	Calcutta: Riding a Jose Ramirez Barreto goal, three-time champions Mohun Bagan bagged three crucial points with a win over Salgaocar in the ONGC I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium Monday. The Brazilians winner came in the 34th minute.
 
	The win helped Mohun Bagan move up to the third spot in the standings with 27 points from 15 matches. Salgaocar, on the other hand, pushed themselves deeper into the relegation zone with seven points from 15 ties.
 
	Mohun Bagan may have surged ahead with three valuable points, but had to lose four frontline players for their next tie against Dempo at home on Saturday. Down with injuries, Barreto (ankle), Mohan Raj (knee) and Subhasish Roy Chowdhury (hamstring) are likely to miss Mohun Bagans next tie. 
 
	Captain Bhaichung Bhutia will sit out for double booking while Douglas Da Silva is already out of contention with a hamstring injury.
 
	Mohun Bagan got the goal in a spectacular fashion when Mohan Raj threw the ball inside the six-yard box with both Barreto and Salgaocar goalie Milagrio Medeira rising high. Barreto won the aerial tussle and put the green-and-maroons up by a goal.
 
	Having conceded the goal, the Goans tried to tighten the screws in their defence and launched attacks one after other with mid-fielders operating quite well. But the all-important equaliser eluded them till the last minute. For this, Mohun Bagan custodian Sangram Mukherjee needs a special mention for his efforts under the bar. Mukherjee bagged the Man of the Match award. 
 
	Things didnt go as per plan for Bhutia. In trying to put extra effort, he was booked by referee S. Suresh for the second time in the league and will have no option but to warm the bench against Dempo at the weekend. 
 
	TEAMS
 
	Mohun Bagan: Sangram Mukherjee, Subhasish Roy Chowdhury (Anit Ghosh 74), Peter Odafe, N.S. Manju, Mohan Raj (Rahul Kumar 45), Habibur Rehman Mondal, L. James Singh, Dharamjit Singh, Lalkamal Bhowmick, Jose Ramirez Barreto, Bhaichung Bhutia.
 
	Salgaocar: Milagrio Medeira, Agnelo Colaco, Peter Costa, William Colaco, Remus Gomes (Anil Kumar 85), Rocus Lamare, Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Hery Habimana (Nicolas Rodrigues 81), Joe Rodrigues (Milagres Gonsales 62), Felix Chimaokwo, Fabio Dos Passos. 
 
	Referee: S. Suresh.
 
	 In Kozhikode, captain Okolie Odafe struck twice and his African-mate Mboyo Iyomi scored once to give Churchill Brothers a comfortable 3-1 win over Viva Kerala. The hosts reduced the margin through Saleel (21st minute). Churchill Brothers are in second spot with 29 points behind Dempo (30), while Viva Kerala (12) are in ninth place, facing the threat of relegation along with Salgaocar.

                                                   Leipus turns up at India practice

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Adelaide: Hundreds made for the Adelaide Oval during Team Indias practice session on Tuesday afternoon and in that crowd was Andrew Leipus, whod been the physio from October 1999 to December 2004. 
    
	Its nice to see the boys again and I just cant forget the memorable win here on the last tour (2003-04), Leipus told The Telegraph. 
    
	Leipus, whod actually settled down in Mumbai for a couple of years, returned to home town Adelaide two months ago. 
    
	This is where I belong and Im trying to re-establish myself... Ive only just come back, he added.

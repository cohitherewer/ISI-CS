The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Duncan Edwards the best Ive ever seen: Bobby Charlton

	When I used to hear Mohammed Ali proclaim to the world that he was the greatest, I would always smile. The greatest of them all was a footballer named Duncan Edwards  Jimmy Murphy         
	Is it possible that Duncan Edwards was really that good? Greater, perhaps, than Pele or Alfredo di Stefano? Frustratingly, there being little film footage available of him in action, we must depend upon the evidence of eyewitnesses at the time.         
	 He was the best player Ive ever seen and the best footballer I ever played with, says Sir Bobby Charlton. I always felt I could compare well with any player  except Duncan. He was such a talent, I always felt inferior to him.         
	Even Matt Busby, who was vehement in his refusal to acknowledge that one Babe might be regarded as more important than the others, could not camouflage the tone of awe that entered his voice whenever Edwardss name was raised. Duncan had everything. He was so big, so strong, so confident and still so young. Right from the start we gave up trying to spot flaws in his game.         
	The complete footballer who could have played in any outfield position  though he is primarily remembered as a defensive midfielder  Edwards was only 18 when he became Englands youngest post-War international, a record that stood until Michael Owens debut in 1998. But long before he starred in Englands crushing 2-7 defeat of Scotland at Wembley on April 2, 1955, every club in the land had been monitoring the movements of the boy wonder from the Black Country.         
	As early as 1948, a handwritten letter from Uniteds chief scout in the Midlands, Jack Brien, landed on Busbys desk. Have today seen a 12-year-old schoolboy who merits special watching. His name is Duncan Edwards, of Dudley. Instructions please. Briens recommendation was promptly passed on to coach Bert Whalley with the added instructions: Please arrange special watch immediately  MB.         
	With the young man in question turning out for Wolverhampton Street Secondary School, Dudley Schools XI, Worcester County XI and Birmingham amp; District XI, arranging a special watch represented something of a full-time occupation. At the age of 13, he walked out at Wembley on April 1, 1950, to win his first cap for England Schoolboys against Wales Schoolboys in front of a crowd of 100,000; at 14 he was appointed England Schools captain  a position he would hold for two seasons. Having put pen to paper, young Duncan, still in his pyjamas, left Whalley and his father, Gladstone, to sort out the details while he climbed the stairs to bed, muttering: I dont know what all this fuss was about. Ive said all along that Manchester United were the only club I wanted to join.         
	Ten months later Edwards made his first-team debut at left-half aged 16 years and 183 days against Cardiff City at Old Trafford; not that the date April 4, 1953, is writ large in the history of Manchester United, a 1-4 defeat leaving the reigning champions in the no-mans land of mid-table.         
	A permanent fixture in the England Under-23 side from the age of 17, Uniteds teenage sorcerer may have grown in fame with every passing game but he remained engagingly modest throughout his all-too-brief career.         
	According to Busby, the bigger the occasion the better he liked it, and there were few bigger occasions than Englands 1956 international against World Cup holders West Germany in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. Inspired by Edwardss wonder goal, England went on to win 3-1.         
	After being carried from the wreckage of the plane, Edwards fought for life with the same indomitable spirit in which he played football. Suffering from a collapsed lung, damaged kidneys, broken ribs, broken pelvis, multiple fractures of his right thigh and a litany of internal injuries, for 15 days he defied death in the Rechts der Isar Hospital before even he had to accept defeat.         
	 Edwards is buried in the Borough Cemetery, Dudley, where the inscription on his headstone reads: A day of memory, Sad to recall, Without farewell, He left us all           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni still has a lot to prove: Lloyd
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dhoni still has a lot to prove: Lloyd
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Clive Lloyd                           
	Mumbai: Mahendra Singh Dhoni might have mesmerised the Indian fans with his captaincy skills, but according to former captains Clive Lloyd and Kapil Dev, his true mettle will be revealed only when the team passes through a tough phase.         
	Captaining any team is difficult. Dhoni will be judged in the next four-five years when India play all around the world, 64-year-old Lloyd, in the city on a promotional tour, said on Wednesday.         
	At the moment he is getting the players to play for him. He is an attractive player and gets his side to be an attractive one too.         
	Kapil echoed his former World Cup rivals views. The going is good now for the Indian team under Dhoni. But their character can be judged only when things go wrong, Indias 1983 World Cup winning captain said.         
	Lloyd, one of the most successful captains with 36 Test wins when he led the West Indies in the late 70s and early 80s, said India had the potential to be the no.1 team.         
	I dont see why India cant be the top team in the world. They have top class players and they should aim to be the no.1 team, said the 64 tall legend, nicknamed the Big Cat.         
	On the cricket scene back home in the Caribbean, Lloyd said: Its a sad situation. Our cricketers at the domestic level are not very good. In India, you have the IPL and ICL where the youngsters rub shoulders with leading players. We too plan to have a professional league with two foreigners in each team. Hope that will help improve the standard of our cricket.         
	Asked about the IPL-ICL row, Lloyd said that if the situation continues, then the ICC might have to intervene. ICL started the concept but the sad part is that neither of them seems to step back. ICC should look at the future and make them work complementing each other, he said.         
	Another World Cup winning captain, Australian Allan Border, who was also present on the occasion, defended his compatriot Matthew Hayden on the latters recent third world remarks about India.         
	I know him (Hayden) very well and I can tell you that he loves India and loves playing cricket here, Border, the first batsman to make more than 11,000 career runs in Tests, said.

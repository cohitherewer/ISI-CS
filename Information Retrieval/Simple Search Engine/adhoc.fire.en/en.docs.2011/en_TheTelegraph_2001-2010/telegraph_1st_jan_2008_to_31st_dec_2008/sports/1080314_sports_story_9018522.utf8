The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis turns humble
                                                     Lewis turns humble
    - MINDGAMES galore ahead of season-opening Australian Grand Prix                 Lewis Hamilton in Melbourne on Thursday. (Reuters)                           
	Melbourne: Lewis Hamilton refused to be lulled into a sense of false security by McLaren teammate Heikki Kovalainen at the Australian Grand Prix on Thursday.         
	The Finn, who joined from Renault in a straight swap with double world champion Fernando Alonso, played down his chances of taking pole position or winning Sundays Formula One season-opener.         
	Hamilton, who won four races in a sensational rookie season last year, suggested Kovalainen was being too modest.         
	I think hes not showing his cards yet and hes playing it down a little. Everyone knows that he is very, very competitive. At least I do and hes got a great talent, the 23-year-old Briton told reporters.         
	I am sure hes going to be pushing me just as much as I push him.         
	The Briton, who fell out spectacularly with Spaniard Alonso last year, said his relationship with the Finn couldnt be better.         
	Hes been a lot more active in the team than any other driver Ive seen, he added.         
	Weve been playing tennis, basketball and weve done our fitness trip together. Its great to see him participating in everything.         
	Hamilton said last years troubles, with McLaren fined a record $100 million and stripped of all their constructors points for a spying controversy over Ferrari data, had strengthened the team.         
	I think McLaren as a team are definitely stronger than they were last year, he said.         
	I feel this year they made quite a big step up from last year with everything they went through, they really managed to pull their socks up and keep going.         
	I feel slightly more confident this year because Ive seen the development of the car and seen how hard the team have worked, he added.         
	Hamilton said he felt less pressure as he prepared for his second season in Formula One, despite huge expectations.         
	Im chasing the same dream but I guess in a slightly different way that I probably cannot describe, he said.         
	It still feels fresh, new and very much something Ive always wanted to do. I still feel Ive just got over my rookie badge.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players union backs EPL plan
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Players union backs EPL plan

	Support for an English Premier League grew on Monday as the players union described proposals for the radical tournament as clear and exciting.         
	Keith Bradshaw and David Stewart, the schemes prime movers, will attempt to convince an executive board meeting of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that an EPL from 2010 is the way to go. They hope the board will agree for a full consultation process to take place during which investors will be publicly identified and the counties will learn what they will gain from an EPL.         
	It is the battle to win hearts and minds around the country that will make or break their ground-breaking plan. One county source on Monday described an atmosphere of fear and loathing over a plan which will see the establishment of nine new franchises based at Englands international grounds.         
	Bradshaw and Stewart will be buoyed by words of support from the Professional Cricketers Association (PCA), a body that represent players from all 18 counties.         
	I feel very positive after reading something that is clear and exciting, said Sean Morris, the chief executive of the PCA. It identifies a lot of opportunities and not just for the nine teams but for the whole game. It all makes sense completely. The issue will be how they generate the numbers and how it is distributed. If you can get the distribution right then it will be good for everybody.         
	Emotions are running high ahead of the meeting. Bradshaw and Stewart received a letter from Giles Clarke, the chairman of the ECB, in which they were asked to explain why they had broken boardroom confidence by issuing a public statement on Saturday.

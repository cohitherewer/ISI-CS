	Chennai: Indias strike bowler Jhulan Goswami, the mainstay of countrys women cricket, said womens cricket will have a separate platform in a couple of years.         
	Arriving with the victorious Indian womens team after their Asia Cup win for the fourth time, Jhulan, who crossed the memorable 100-wicket haul in the shorter version of the game, lauded the ongoing IPL tournament.         
	IPL Twenty20 is exciting and it is going to be the future. Indian women cricket is improving, though it could be much better. But there has been great stride during the last three or four years, she said.         
	Jhulan said the team has been working harder. I thank my teammates for their stupendous support but for which I could not have achieved the feat of claiming 100 wickets.         
	Thanking board president Sharad Pawar for helping womens cricket, Jhulan and the captain Mithali Raj said: We thank Pawar for giving us a cash awards of Rs 5 lakh.           (PTI)

	Mohun Bagan               
	JOSE RAMIREZ BARRETO: The experienced Brazilian is clearly the man to look out for on Sunday. Though not fully fit, this 32-year old on Saturday was hopeful of making a comeback to secure the CFL championship for Bagan. With five goals in his kitty along with a hattrick, Barreto is however, expected to start from the second-half.         
	PETER ODAFE: The lanky central defender will be the other Bagan man to watch out for. His sharp movement and brilliant tackling skills will be coach Karim Bencharifas formula to hinder Theodore Sunday and Mike Okoros movements inside his citadel.         
	MOHAMMEDAN SPORTING               
	MIKE OKORO: The Nigerian has to share a lot of responsibilities on the crucial tie, which happens to be the decisive one of the local league. On the day, he is likely to be a playmaker, creating opportunities for Sunday (if he plays). Capable of tearing apart any defence, Okoro with his intelligent moves will be Shabbir Alis most dependable man.         
	THEODORE SUNDAY: Though this promising forward is not sure of playing on Sunday, much depends on his performance. If he can manage to shake off his injuries and make a comeback, things will surely look bright for Shabbir Alis men.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Messi left me enthralled
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Messi left me enthralled

	Unfortunately that was the last time India qualified for the main Olympics. Forty eight years have passed since then but no other Indian team has managed to cross the hurdles of the pre-Olympics.        
	Now that the national team is doing well, I am hopeful that Bob Houghton and his young brigade may qualify for the next Olympics in London, a place where a bunch of barefooted Indians, led by Sailen Manna, mesmerised the spectators 60 years ago.        
	Coming back to football in Beijing, I truly enjoyed the show this time. Argentina were certainly the deserving winners but I was also highly impressed by the Nigerians.        
	In 2010, the World Cup will be staged in South Africa. If the display by the Nigerians in Beijing is any indication, I wont be surprised to see one of the African teams making the last four of the World Cup.        
	Among the Nigerians, I was most impressed by defender Dele Adeleye, holding midfielder Sani Kaita and offensive players, Solomon Okoronkwo, Obinna Nsofor and Chinedu Ogbuke. Okoronkwo was full of grit on the right. There was lot of power in his approach. Ogbuke showed efficiency in playing across the pitch, while Adeleye was commanding at the back.        
	At the same time, I must compliment the Argentina players for sticking to their professional attitude despite the fact the final was not played under ideal situation. A crowd of 90 thousand, including Diego Maradona, watched the final under very hot conditions which reached 42 degree Celsius.        
	I must say that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) should have looked after the interest of the footballers than the television sponsors. The heat was such that the referee had to take the rare step of twice allowing the players to stop and take drinks.        
	Not surprisingly, the game was of poor quality in the first half with too many mistakes, misplaced passes and players trying to move slowly around the field to conserve energy.        
	Yet that goal in the final made me sit back and replay it several times in my mind. To put it simply, it was a stupendous effort.        
	One thing I must admit that when Lionel Messi provided the fine pass down the left side and it was strategically picked up by Di Maria, I never really expected him to chip the ball over advancing goalkeeper Ambruse Vanzekin with such accuracy and calmness from outside the box.        
	But he did and Di Maria was so confident that he made the ball drop far away from the goal line. His idea was to make sure that the ball would roll in. It was a rare show of confidence and skill that only a truly professional can perform.         
	Also, let me put it on record that after the Beijing Games, I have become the latest member of the Lionel Messi fan club.         
	He did wonderfully at the club level and in the World Cup, but the variations he displayed in the Olympics left me stunned.        
	Dear readers, please dont blame me for exaggeration but Messi at the Olympics reminded me of Pele and Maradona for his sheer ability to change pace and the variety of plans he always had in store.        
	No wonder that even a man like Pele regretted that he never had a chance to play in the Olympics. Messi played a vital role in elevating the prestige of Olympic football.

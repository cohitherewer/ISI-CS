The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chopra shares 44th spot
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chopra shares 44th spot
                      
	Hilton Head Island (US): A poor start kept Daniel Chopra pre-occupied with a catching up job throughout his second round and the Indian-born Swede returned one-over 72 to be tied 44th after the midway stage of the $5.5 million Verizon Heritage golf tournament.         
	Chopra had parred the first couple of holes before he ran into trouble with the next two holes claiming three shots.         
	Birdies on the fifth and ninth propped him up but two bogeys and as many birdies on his way back meant a sub-par card remained out of his bound.         
	Though Chopra managed to make the cut at the par-71 harbour town golf links, his 36-hole total of one-under 141 means he would need two solid rounds over the next couple of days to notch up a decent finish in the tournament.         
	Lucas Glover shot his second successive round of 66 too total 10-under, for a one shot lead over defending champion Boo Weekley (64).           (PTI)

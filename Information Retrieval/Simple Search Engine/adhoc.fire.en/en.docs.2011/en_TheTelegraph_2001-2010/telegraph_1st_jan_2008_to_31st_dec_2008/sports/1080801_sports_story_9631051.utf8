The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru: Just played my shots
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Viru: Just played my shots
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Galle: Virender Sehwag, who scored his 15th Test century on Thursday, said he was unruffled by the flurry of wickets in the final session of the match. He just went about playing his shots.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	If the flurry of wickets disturbed his concentration         
	I was not jolted They all got out to good balls. The bowling was of top quality  Murali, Mendis and Vaas. Theyre the kind of bowlers who can bowl a good ball at any time and you have to play them carefully.         
	If he was extra cautious after the first Test disaster         
	It didnt make a difference to my batting. But each batsman plays with a different mindset, and maybe it made a difference to some of the others. I was just playing my shots.         
	If he was bored in the dressing room during the rain break         
	I was doing stretching and ran 10 runs I did what I had to in the dressing-room.         
	His thoughts on Rahul Dravids dismissal         
	I didnt know for sure because I was at the non-strikers end... I had a doubt on whether the ball hit the helmet. Maybe it did hit the helmet, but if you yourself are not sure how can you ask the umpire? If the Sri Lankans knew that it hit the helmet and still appealed then the spirit was not right.         
	On how the day turned out         
	We were in a good position. The first wicket stand was 167 and then we lost four quick wickets. It happens in Test cricket. But all batsmen got out to good balls. You cant blame anyone.         
	The wicket         
	Its a good wicket. The ball is coming on to the bat nicely. Maybe it will turn from the third or fourth day.         
	The opening partnership         
	It was important for Gautam and me to give a good start and we did that. Hopefully well carry on like that... We discussed these things in the meetings before this match and we were happy to be able to give a good start.         
	Is he satisfied with the outcome?         
	At this point there is no satisfaction. Theres still plenty of cricket left. If I can make this a big one, may be score 200, and take the total to 400-500 and thereby put the team in a good position, then I will be satisfied We can then put pressure on Sri Lanka.         
	His batting style         
	I always back myself and play my shots. How can I stop that? If the ball is there to be hit I hit it. You sometimes do think, what if I play a shot and get out after four wickets have fallen but if you dont play your shots how will you make runs?         
	Tackling Ajantha Mendis         
	I was picking him off the wicket. Whenever he bowled I saw how the ball behaved after pitching and played him accordingly.         
	A good total on this wicket         
	350 or 400 should be a good total.

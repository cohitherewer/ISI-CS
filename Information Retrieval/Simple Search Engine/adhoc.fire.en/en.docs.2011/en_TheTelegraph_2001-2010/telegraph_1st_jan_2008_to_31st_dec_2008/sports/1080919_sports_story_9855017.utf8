            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Till Wednesday, there seemed to be only two contenders  Bengals Gopal Bose and Assams Rajesh Borah  for the senior national selectors post from East.         
	On Thursday, however the buzz in local circles was that Raju Mukherjee, a former Bengal captain, could also be in contention.         
	There was, however, no confirmation from anybody from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that Mukherjee was also, in fact, being considered.         
	The senior national selection committee will be appointed at the September 27-28 BCCI AGM in Mumbai.

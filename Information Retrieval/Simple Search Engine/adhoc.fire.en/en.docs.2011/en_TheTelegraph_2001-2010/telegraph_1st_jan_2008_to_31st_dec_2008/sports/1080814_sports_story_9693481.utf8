                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Du wins gold for China
                      
	Beijing, Aug. 14 (AP): Chinas Du Li left her previous shooting competition weeping and so distraught she considering dropping out of the Olympics.         
	On Thursday tears flowed again, but this time they were those of joy and relief as Du left clutching the gold medal in the womens 50-meter, three-position rifle.         
	Du led by one point entering the finals and shot a 101.3 to win the event with an Olympic record 690.3 points. Silver medalist Katerina Emmons finished with 687.7 points.         
	During the first event I did perform very bad and it was a big pity, quot; Du said. quot;I let many people down. I thought about giving up but ... during the past days fans give me a lot of support and my spirit resumed. quot;         
	The victory eased the sting of Dus performance in the 10-meter air rifle event, when she was a favorite but finished fifth. She said the pressure of competing at home got to her.         
	It looked like she might be in for a similar fate on Thursday when she scored a round-low 8.7 on the first shot. She turned it around on the next shot, scoring a 10.3 and didnt falter after that. She wrapped up the win with a 10.8 on the ninth shot.         
	 quot;I was a little nervous, quot; said Du, whose 589 points in qualifying tied an Olympic record. quot;I made the same mistake that I made at the 10-meter air rifle. But I knew I couldnt repeat the same mistake for the remaining shots. quot;         
	Du said she received many postcards and words of encouragement since her first event and was touched by those sentiments. She thanked Emmons, who consoled her after that loss.         
	 quot;What was most difficult was not the (last) four years, but the last four days which felt longer than four years, quot; she said. quot;It was so hard since I lost my first, but I held on. quot;         
	Emmons, of the Czech Republic, came in second after taking gold in the 10m air rifle. She is married to American shooter Matt Emmons.

	Bilbao: World No.1 Viswanathan Anand signed off with a mundane draw against Magnus Carlsen of Norway to finish last in the Bilbao Grand Slam final and the outcome might cost the Indian his numero uno status in Fide rankings.         
	Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria came up with a resounding victory over Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine in the final round to win the tournament with 17 points and is likely to regain the No. 1 spot in the world rankings.         
	Following his eighth draw in the tournament besides two losses, Anand is likely to lose close to 15 rating points from his outing here and for the first time in recent years, the Indian finished last in a high-category tournament.         
	With his scintillating display, Topalov pocketed winners purse of Euro 150000. The Bulgarian won four games than any other player in the meet and lost just one game. Nearest rivals Carlsen and Levon Aronian of Armenia ended on 13 points and shared the second spot. Anand, with eight points, finished last.

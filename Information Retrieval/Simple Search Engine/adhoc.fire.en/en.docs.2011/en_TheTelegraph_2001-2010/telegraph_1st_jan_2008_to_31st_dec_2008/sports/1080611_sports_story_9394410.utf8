            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dhaka: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhirs 155-run opening partnership earned praise from both captains on Tuesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni: I am very happy with our performance. Our overall performance was good, we exploited the conditions well. We got a brilliant start It was important to win the toss It was a kind of wicket which would get slower and slower as the game progressed. (Virender) Sehwag and (Gautam) Gambhir batted very well It was not all about boundaries, they ran well and picked singles off good balls. Later on they picked up boundaries at will All credit to the batsmen Obviously dropped chances were there, but they are a part and parcel of the game. The bowlers also did well Praveen (Kumar), Ishant (Sharma), Piyush (Chawla) Everybody bowled well. Its good to have a strong bench-strength         
	Shoaib Malik: Today (Tuesday) was a bad day Nothing went right for us. The Indians batted well and our bowlers did not bowl in the right areas. Sehwag and Gambhir are a brilliant pair, they batted very well. We missed a quality spinner in our line-up I didnt bowl because we had five regular bowlers in our side.         
	Virender Sehwag (MoM): It was a good wicket to bat on The new ball was coming onto the bat well. After Twenty20, its hard to leave the ball. In 50 overs match, you dont need to hit from the first ball You need to build the innings. I have a good understanding with Gautam We have been playing together for Delhi and India. Its easy to bat with him.

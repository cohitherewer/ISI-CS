                                                     Think-tank mulls Chawla option 
  - No talk about bringing back Sehwag at the SCG     - FIRST TRI-SERIES FINAL      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Piyush Chawla                                 
	Sydney: The Team India think-tank is looking at the possibility of playing leggie Piyush Chawla in the first final of the tri-series, at the SCG, on Sunday.         
	Chawla is a good option and Id like to have him in the XI at the expense of Munaf Patel... A decision hasnt, of course, been taken, a member of the think-tank told The Telegraph on Friday evening.         
	He confirmed that five bowlers (including allrounder Irfan Pathan) would play and, so, theres no chance of senior pro Virender Sehwag being recalled.         
	Pathan, Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar and offie Harbhajan Singh are certain of playing. Even if Chawla doesnt make his maiden appearance in the tri-series, Munafs selection is far from guaranteed.         
	In such a scenario, its possible that we could play Sreesanth instead of Munaf... Sreesanth usually bowls well against Australia and thats bound to be taken into account if the Chawla option isnt exercised, the think-tanks member pointed out.         
	Clearly, as of late Friday, only one change (to the XI which beat Sri Lanka in Hobart) was being considered.         
	The Indians, meanwhile, had their first nets since arriving here on Wednesday. Sachin Tendulkar spent much of the time at the indoor facility at the SCG, while the rest practised outdoors.         
	Thankfully, there was no rain.

                                                   Pullout will hit Aussie image: Lawson
                      
	Karachi: The Australian cricket teams image will receive a setback if they cancel their tour of Pakistan scheduled to start on March 29, coach Geoff Lawson said on Friday.         
	Lawson, an Australian, said that a pullout would have far reaching consequences for cricket in both countries.         
	It is not just about the cancellation of a few matches. The timing is such that it clashes with the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) and already people in Pakistan are talking about this coincidence, Lawson said.         
	I fear the damage to the reputation of Australian cricket would be great if their players joined the IPL in the period they were supposed to be touring Pakistan. A cancellation would turn global sentiments against Ricky Ponting and his team, the Pakistan coach said.         
	Cricket Australia (CA) and the Australian Cricketers Association are waiting for a final security assessment in Pakistan from private consultants before they take a decision by Monday.         
	Lawson was also critical of some of the comments made by a few Australian players about the situation in Pakistan. They dont realise just how important cricket is in some countries and it is not just about cancelling a few games.         
	It is about national pride and the long term future of Pakistan cricket which would be jeopardised if they dont come, he said.         
	Everybody here knows there would be no problems with the tour. Except for them. It is not about loss of TV revenues. It is about the long term repercussions.         
	It would set a bad precedent. It would allow others to say the Australians didnt come. It would lead to Pakistan being isolated in world cricket.         
	Lawson said he had been found big cities such as Lahore and Karachi relatively peaceful. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eduardo undergoes surgery
                                                   Eduardo undergoes surgery
                      
	London: Arsenal striker Eduardo has undergone surgery after breaking a leg in Saturdays Premier League match against Birmingham City.         
	Arsenal said on their website that the Brazilian-born Croatian international was resting in hospital after an operation for a broken leg.         
	Manager Arsene Wenger has already ruled him out for the rest of the season and possibly much longer, meaning that he will miss the European championships in Austria and Switzerland in June. The incident was so horrific that television stations declined to show the replay, although Sundays News of the World had graphic photographs on its inside pages. There has been widespread speculation that the 24-year-olds career is in danger.         
	Da Silvas Croatia teammate Vedran Corluka said he was close to tears when he saw the incident.         
	I was very disappointed and sad because Eduardo is my friend, the Manchester City player told Sky Sports News. When I saw that thing happen to him I wanted to cry because hes such a good guy and he didnt deserve that.         
	I dont want to talk about that tackle. I think the player didnt want to do that, it just happened. Im just sad because Eduardo didnt deserve that. The player made that tackle but I think he didnt want to do that, he was just unlucky on that tackle.         
	The Rio de Janeiro-born player is one of a number of Brazilians who have played for different countries after moving abroad. (Reuters)

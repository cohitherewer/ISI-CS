The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its Nadal versus Youzhny
                                                Its Nadal versus Youzhny
            SREEMOY TALUKDAR                            
	Chennai: There is a method in the madness after all.         
	The city was being battered by unseasonal rain for the past two days. So much so that the quarter finals got delayed.         
	But on Saturday, suddenly it was a clear blue sky. It had to be because the gods clearly wanted to witness Rafael Nadal take on mentor and close friend Carlos Moya in the semi-finals of the Chennai Open.         
	And it was tennis fit for gods, no less, as the top seed saved four match points to better Moya 6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (10-8), 7-6 (7-1) in three hours and 54 minutes and set up a title clash against Mikhail Youzhny.         
	The fourth-seeded Russian had earlier accounted for Marin Cilic 6-2, 6-3.         
	To understand how the match went, perhaps one comment from Nadal during the post match press conference should suffice.         
	The world No.2, who turned pro on 2001 and has played more than a few singles on the way, said: It is not everyday that you get to play a match like this.         
	It was exhilarating stuff as the Mallorcan duo fired from the baseline, came up to the net, used the length of the court and slammed winners from amazing angles. Every zapper was matched and bettered by the other that threw the 5000-strong crowd into throes of collective ecstasy and agony.         
	It is pointless and even sacrilege to go into statistics about such a clash where none deserved to lose but for the record, of the 274 points on offer, Moya clocked 134 and Nadal 140. There was absolutely nothing in there.         
	The first set went with the serves till the tie-break where Moya created a lot more chances than Nadal to clinch the tie-break 7-6 (7-3).         
	In the second, and probably the most interesting set, Nadal broke Moya in the 5th game. He was broken in turn on the 10th and in the ensuing tie-breaker, the third seed got four match points.         
	You dont throw away four match points against Rafa and win in the end, is how Moya put it later as the world No.2 came back in the way only he can to shut out the set 7-6 (10-8).         
	The third and decisive set, the 31-year-old found strength enough to hammer Nadal and achieve a break in the fifth game. Nadal broke back in the 10th and when it went into tie-break, it was clear who would be the winner.         
	Moya, for all his experience, doesnt have age on his side. He had matched his opponent shot for shot all through but had to dig deep in his reserves.         
	In the end the former world No.1 ran out of gas and submitted 6-7 (1-7) in the tie-break. A standing ovation followed.         
	These kind of matches keep me motivated It was amazing when they were chanting my name. I want to carry on, the vanquished said later.         
	Earlier in the evening, Youzhny hardly broke a sweat win in an hour and 23 minutes.         
	The bitter third set battle against Dutchman Robin Haase in the quarters, a match which consumed over two and a half hours and ended well after 1am on Saturday morning, seemed to have taken its toll on the Croat.         
	Backhand is Youzhnys most lethal weapon and it was on song from the first ball that he hit on Saturday, a cracking down-the-line winner. That set the tone as the fourth seed broke the world No.71 in the very first game of the first set. He achieved a double break and wrapped it up in 34 minutes.         
	Youzhny broke in the ninth and final game of the second set to clinch the issue. But the Russian needs to play out of his skin to deny Nadal his first Chennai Open title.

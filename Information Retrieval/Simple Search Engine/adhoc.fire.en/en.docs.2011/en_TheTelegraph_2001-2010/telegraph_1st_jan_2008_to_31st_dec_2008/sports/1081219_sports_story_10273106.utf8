The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rahuls form no worry: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                             Rahuls form no worry: Dhoni
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni during a practice session at the PCA Stadium in Mohali on Thursday. (PTI)                           
	Mohali: Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Thursday that he was in favour of a session by session approach to a Test match rather than thinking about the final outcome.         
	If you start thinking about Day Five or the outcome of the match at the start of the first day, then it might get difficult for you, Dhoni told reporters after the practice session.         
	I believe you need short-term, session-wise plans. In fact if you are a having tough time in a particular session, break it into 8-10 over spells. That is my approach, Dhoni said.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q How is the wicket?         
	A It is quite dry I believe it is a fraction harder on the surface. At the same time, quite a few Ranji matches have taken place here. It can be deceptive and at the same time it can be on the slower side. The cracks are normal, as it was in Chennai.         
	With a victory already under your belt, will it be easy for you?         
	Nothing is easy I can assure you. International cricket is very tough. It looks easy when you have a good side and the side is doing everything right like it is now. I think the team is doing great, more than anything else.         
	How do you assess your victory in the Chennai Test?         
	I think we didnt win too many sessions in the first three days but in the last two days, we did well when it mattered most. We raised our standard and took responsibility. I think Virus (Virender Sehwag) innings was very crucial and Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh) and Sachin (Tendulkar) did well also. I think the bowlers also did a great job there. Whenever they (England) had a partnership, our bowlers were still bowling to win.         
	Are you worried by Rahul Dravids form?         
	I have been answering this question in every press conference and let me tell you again that we are not really worried about Rahuls form. Its just a matter of time before he gets back to form Once he passes the 30-run mark he can get his confidence back. Nobody can question his talent and determination. Its the initial phase and he has not been able to pass that phase. But we have confidence in him.         
	Will Dravid bat lower down the order?         
	As of now, its not confirmed. But then, shifting Rahul to number five and asking VVS (Laxman) to bat at number three seems okay at times. VVS has scored runs at number three and it would be easy for Rahul too.

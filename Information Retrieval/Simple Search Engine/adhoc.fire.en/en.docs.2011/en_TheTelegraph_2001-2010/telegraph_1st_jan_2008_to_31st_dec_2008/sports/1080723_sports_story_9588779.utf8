            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: The Ministerial Security Division (MSD) personnel manning the Taj Samudra floor where the Indian cricketers have been put up had an unusual problem late on Monday.         
	Specifically, around 11 pm, they had to challenge and then pack off two women who turned up claiming they had to meet somebody in a room which, strangely, was unoccupied.         
	We checked the list of occupants and found nobody was in that particular room... They didnt argue and moved away from the floor once we made it clear that they couldnt get anywhere close to any room, an MSD officer told The Telegraph.         
	Both women, by the way, were well-dressed and fluent in English.

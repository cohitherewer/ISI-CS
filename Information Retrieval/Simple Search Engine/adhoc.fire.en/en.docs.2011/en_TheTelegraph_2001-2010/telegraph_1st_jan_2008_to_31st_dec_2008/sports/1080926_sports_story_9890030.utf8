The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Colin blames Faldo for defeat
                                                                                                                                                                                             Colin blames Faldo for defeat
            LEWINE MAIR in LONDON               Nick Faldo                           
	Colin Montgomerie says he would not have taken the Nick Faldo route had he been Europes captain in the Ryder Cup at Valhalla.         
	There are certain things I would have done the same  and some differently, said the Scot, who is expected to lead the team in 2014 at Gleneagles.         
	When pressed as to whether Faldo had got the best out of his men, Montgomerie began with a preamble as to how, after two straight 181/2-91/2 wins, a defeat on the scale of Valhalla  161/2-111/2  was not the best. So possibly not, was his verdict.         
	It was the singles line-up which worried him the most. He accepted that Faldo discussed the order with his players and that they were in agreement. Had he been there, though, he said he would have felt constrained to point out the danger of having three top players  Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Padraig Harrington  down at the bottom.         
	You have to get the line-up spot-on  and it occurred to me at once that our three strongest men might not be in the final shake-up, he said.         
	Only once has America v Europe been decided between the No.12s  and that was in 1991 when Bernhard Langer played Hale Irwin, said Montgomerie.         
	Montgomerie had been all set to be diplomatic when he arrived at the Belfry for this weeks Quinn Insurance British Masters but, as in golf itself, things do not always go according to plan.         
	When asked to what extent he had felt for Faldos men, and then for the beaten Ryder Cup captain himself, Montgomerie began by saying that he could not feel more for the players.         
	Ive been on three beaten sides as against five winning ones and I know exactly what its like to be on the plane coming home, he said. Anything you might have done as an individual fades when the team has lost. You just havent got the magic 141/2 points you need.         
	That said, he addressed the second part of the question  relating to how much he felt for Faldo  and said he was sorry but he could not answer.         
	Montgomerie accepted that the captain had not been helped by the performances of Sergio Garcia, Westwood and Harrington, none of whom had been at their best. Again, he noted that the US rookies had been stronger than Europes and that the Americans had generally putted better than their opponents, with particular reference to the 48-year-old Kenny Perry.         
	On a slightly different tack, he said that if and when he got the captaincy, he would want to do things the Paul Azinger way and have just eight players making the side automatically, with four wild-card picks as opposed to two.         
	Just because we went into Valhalla having won five matches out of six, it didnt mean that our selection process was right, he said. He does not believe that the system needs to be changed at once, as it would be too much of a knee-jerk reaction when Europe has lost just once in the last four starts  but its a thing of the future.

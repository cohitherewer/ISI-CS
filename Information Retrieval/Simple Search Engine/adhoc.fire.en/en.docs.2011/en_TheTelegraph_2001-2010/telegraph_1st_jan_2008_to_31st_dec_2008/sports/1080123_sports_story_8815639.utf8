                                                   Liverpool avoid loss to Aston Villa

           
	London: Peter Crouch grabbed a late equaliser to earn Liverpool a 2-2 draw with Aston Villa in a Premier League game at Anfield played out against a backdrop of anger and protest Monday. 
    
	The England strikers 88th-minute goal rescued the troubled home side after Villa had scored twice in three minutes against the run of play. 
    
	Villa substitute Marlon Harewood cancelled out Israeli Yossi Benayouns first-half strike with an acrobatic scissors kick, his first touch of the game, in the 69th minute before the visitors made it 2-1 with an own goal from Fabio Aurelio. 
    
	Liverpool, who had hoped to leapfrog city rivals Everton into fourth place on goal difference, edged up to fifth on 40 points and ahead of Villa and Manchester City on goal difference. 
    
	Champions Manchester United have 54 points from 23 matches and lead Arsenal on goal difference at the top, with Chelsea third on 50. 
    
	Well keep going, its not over until its over, Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said. But its certainly not good enough. 
    
	The game was played in an atmosphere of simmering anger with the home fans showing their displeasure to the clubs American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett. 
    
	You dont care about (manager) Rafa (Benitez), you dont care about the fans, Liverpool Football Club is in the wrong hands, chanted the crowd. 
    
	The protest was orchestrated by supporters unhappy with Hicks and Gilletts plans for the club and whether they intend to sell to Dubai International Capital, the investment arm of the Dubai Government. 
    
	Hicks also angered the fans last week and undermined Benitez when he revealed Liverpool had spoken to former Germany boss Juergen Klinsmann about taking over as coach. 
    
	Gerrard said events off the field had affected the players. 
    
	Its not just this week, its been going on for some time now, he said. Its certainly not helping the players but Ive got to be careful what I say about the situation.

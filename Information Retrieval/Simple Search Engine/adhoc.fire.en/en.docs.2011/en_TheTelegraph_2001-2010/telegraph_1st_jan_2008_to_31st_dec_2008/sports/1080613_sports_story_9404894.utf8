The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lack of motivation to blame
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lack of motivation to blame
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Srinagar: With the players and resources that were made available to Bengal, it is unfortunate the way they made an inglorious exit from the Santosh Trophy.         
	Bengal, who played four matches here, won only one and virtually struggled to make the semi-finals. The worst, however, came in the penultimate round against Services, a team that showed Bengal their rightful place in Indian football.         
	It is the worst day in my life, said coach Krishnendu Roy after the match as deathly silence prevailed in the dressing room. Never in my career have I lost a match in domestic football by such a huge margin, he said.         
	Roys desperation was understandable but he should have known it before. His dream of winning the Santosh Trophy with the sons of the soil could not be achieved as the lack of motivation was apparent.         
	Motivation was a big problem, said a Bengal official, who was not ready to come on record for obvious reasons.         
	Frankly, Bengal seemed to have lost the battle to regain the Santosh Trophy even before it started.         
	Many in the Bengal ranks were clearly unwilling participants. In private, several players pointed out that they needed rest at the end of the season. Some of them even complained that the allowances were too low.         
	For a change, the IFA cannot be faulted for not looking after their players properly. While many other state teams travelled in unreserved compartments for three days, Bengal boys were flown to Srinagar. Once they reached the venue, the players were put up in a decent hotel and were given enough facilities.         
	Roy should also take the blame for being too lenient with the boys. He allowed them to set their own rules and didnt impose the discipline that was needed to win the trophy after eight years.         
	IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly sounded bitterly disappointed. The way they lost was simply sad. From next year, I will make a recommendation for sending the under-23 team for the national championship. At least it will be an investment for the future, he said.

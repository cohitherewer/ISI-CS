The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I wanted to win this title badly, says Indian ace
                                                                                                                                                                                                       I wanted to win this title badly, says Indian ace
                  Leander Paes                     
	New York: At 35, Leander Paes may not be getting any younger but having added the US Open mixed doubles title to his cupboard, the Indian ace is just not interested in retirement talks.         
	Paes partnered Cara Black and the Indo-Zimbabwean scratch pair struck gold in their maiden Grand Slam by capturing the mixed doubles title Thursday night, taming Britains Jamie Murray and American Liezel Huber 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.         
	Savouring every moment of it, Paes said age was not an issue with him and he would go on as long as he enjoys it.         
	Its fairly simple for me. If I wake up 31 days in a row in the morning and I feel like I dont enjoy this game, Ill stop on the 32nd day. Thats always been the way for me, Paes said in the post-match interview.         
	The Indian ace said he woke up with a purpose and was happy to get his hand on the title, after missing it twice in the past.         
	You know, it was in the back of my mind that I hadnt won this one. Ive been in two finals here. I was match point up in one of them with Lisa Raymond many years ago, and today (Thursday) I woke up in the morning with a purpose.         
	I woke up really fired up, and when I came out to practice, I just said to Cara, you know...         
	Paes heaped praise on Cara and said they would continue playing together.         
	We actually talked about it before we even started this week, that were going to play together all of next year, he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DNA test claims to predict a star
                                                                                                                                                                                                     DNA test claims to predict a star
            PHILIP SHERWELL                       
	Were your children born to run like Usain Bolt or swim like Michael Phelps? Now performance-obsessed American parents may have the opportunity to find out. Atlas Sports Genetics is offering a DNA test that claims to forecast the athletic prowess of children as young as one. The $149 kit lets parents take a swab from their childs mouth, then send off the sample to a laboratory to test for ACTN3, a gene found to have links with athletic success.         
	But scientific critics have compared the tests to a snake oil scheme, arguing that the ACTN3 gene is only one of hundreds that determine whether an individual has particular physical skills and talents.         
	Meanwhile, others have argued that the pitch by Atlas will appeal to parents who would push their children too hard and obsessively, dreaming they might win a lucrative college athlete scholarship en route to a professional sports career.         
	However, Atlas has highlighted the value of the test for children under eight years old as more traditional physical assessments at that age are unreliable indicators of future talents.         
	The tests should give parents some guidance on what type of sports they might want to introduce their children to, said Kevin Reilly, the president of Atlas and a former weightlifting champion.         
	The Colorado company claims that the test can determine whether a child is likely to perform best at endurance sports (such as long-distance running and swimming) or straightforward power sports (such as weightlifting and sprints).         
	The Atlas website boasts: Finding any great Olympic champion normally takes years to determine. What if we knew a part of the answer when we were born?         
	The company cites a pioneering Australian 2003 study that established a link between ACTN3 genes and sporting capability.         
	But these ambitious claims were dismissed by a genetic scientist who spoke to The Sunday Telegraph. The idea that you can take just one gene as an indicator of how a child will perform is outrageous, said Dr Stephen Roth, a University of Maryland genetics expert who has studied ACTN3. Does it contribute? Yes, but it is one of many genes that do so. Two hundred of the 20,000 human genes have so far been associated with some form of athletic achievement.         
	Competitiveness is part of the fabric of American society, but there are fears that this will just add to the pressure, already documented by psychologists, on children to be best on the sports field as well as in the classroom.         
	It is a sad commentary on the fact that many parents are looking for financial gain from their kids or to live through their children, said Dr Roth. As children get older, they will tend to select the sports they most enjoy and that decision usually reflects the ones they are best at.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saha owes it to Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Saha owes it to Ponting
            A STAFF REPORTER                                Wriddhiman Saha      
	Calcutta: Well played U made us all proud was Kolkata Knight Riders owner Shah Rukh Khans text message to Wriddhiman Saha after the youngsters unbeaten 59 off 32 balls in their last Indian Premier League match against Kings XI Punjab.         
	The keeper-batsmans 104-run association with David Hussey for the sixth wicket was however not enough to avoid a nine-run defeat in Mohali. The Siliguri lad is looking ahead with optimism and hopes to cash in on his new found confidence.         
	Everyone wants to perform There is no extra pressure on me. I will try to play my natural game, Wriddhiman told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	His success encouraged his parents to come down from North Bengal but Wriddhiman has told them to see the match on TV. The logic is simple You get a better view on TV than on the field, he said.         
	What was Husseys message?         
	Nothing special He kept on asking me to play naturally and said that we would give it a try if we were together till the end. We almost made it possible.Wriddhiman said he had played enough Twenty20 tournaments locally which has contributed to his being adept at this form. Its a matter of adjustment Be it Twenty20, 50-over a side or the longer format.         
	He has immensely benefited from Ricky Pontings advice. Ponting always used to say, watch the ball till the last He also stressed on not thinking too big and focusing on the basics while walking out to bat, said Wriddhiman.         
	Coach John Buchanan has also been forthcoming. John has been very encouraging mentally. He has also worked on my technique and is always positive in his approach.         
	How is he coping with his new status? Obviously there has been some change. But the consistency factor will determine how good a player you are, he said.

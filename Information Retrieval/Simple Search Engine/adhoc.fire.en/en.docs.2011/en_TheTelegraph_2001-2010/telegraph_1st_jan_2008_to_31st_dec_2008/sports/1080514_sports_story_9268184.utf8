The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Shoaib Akhtar effect
                                                                                                                                                                                                     The Shoaib Akhtar effect
            A STAFF REPORTER      EDEN DIARY                      
	He finally came. He saw. And boy, did he conquer! Sourav Ganguly wanted him, Shah Rukh Khan wanted him, the crowd wanted him and Shoaib Akhtar, the bad boy of world cricket, on Tuesday showed just why. Before he had actually delivered, his very presence seemed to have instilled new belief into his teammates. And in his very first over, with rival captain Virender Sehwag nicking behind, out came the demon. Arms outstretched, head thrown in ecstasy towards heaven, Shoaib the thunder-bolt struck and Delhi were left gasping for breath. The entire Eden crowd went absolutely wild, casting apart all inhibitions. The Shoaib effect.         
	Media blues         
	 Hard-nosed, unimpressive people  thats how journalists are sup-posed to be. Far from letting people know where their sympathies lie, they dont even deem it fit to applaud when the rowdy rabble is going ga ga over a streaky six! But on Tuesday, when Souravs stumps were shattered for seven, the mediamen uttered a collective sigh of despair. The crowds response seemed measured in comparison.         
	Colour conscious         
	 At last something promises to give Calcutta Book Fair a run for its money. The IPL fair! Braving blocked traffic on arterial roads, the maidan has truly been run over by stickers! Yellow, for those not so fortunate and have to park their cars 5km away from the stadium followed by blue, who are stuck in the middle and the VVIP green. The Eden-bound crowd categorised into three clear classes. Three different colours. On a lighter note, who says apartheid is over?

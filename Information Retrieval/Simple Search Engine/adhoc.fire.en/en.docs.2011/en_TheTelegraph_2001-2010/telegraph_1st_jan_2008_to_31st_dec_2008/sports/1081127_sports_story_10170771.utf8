The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai FC clinch a thriller
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mumbai FC clinch a thriller
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai FC returned to winning ways with a dramatic come-from-behind 3-2 win against JCT in a tenth round encounter of the I-League on Wednesday.         
	Mumbai FC seemed headed for a humiliating defeat as they trailed 0-2 till the 57th minute. But two bold substitutions by English coach David Booth brought them as many goals in the space of six minutes and a splendid strike by captain and India player Abhishek Yadav in the 87th minute gave them a well-deserved win.         
	It was a tale of two substitutions, so to say. Abel Hammond coming in for Nelson Cardoz and K. Aseem for Nishant Mehra in a double substitution in the 54th minute proved to be a masterstroke .         
	But the Ghana forward had an instant impact as he gave Mumbai FC their first goal and then repeatedly troubled the JCT defence.         
	JCT took the lead in the 38th minute through a harmless lob from Balwant Singh on the left that sailed over Amit Singha and nestled into the net. The Punjab men doubled the lead in the 50th minute through Eduardo. Booth then replaced Nelson Cardoz and Nishant Mehra with Hammond and K. Aseem.         
	The first goal came in the 57th minute when Kaliya Kulothungan headed a Riston Rodrigues feed and Hammond came up with a return header into the net. Then, Felix Aboagye timed his leap to perfection to meet a corner kick and head in the equaliser.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | If fit, Ishant could be in for 2nd Test
                                                     If fit, Ishant could be in for 2nd Test
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ishant Sharma                           
	Calcutta: Where ironies go, this would be hard to beat.         
	Indeed, left-arm spinner Murali Kartik twisted his left ankle and tore a ligament (in a Central versus North Deodhar match at the Chinnaswamy in Bangalore) just as the national selectors put the seal on his Team India comeback.         
	Kartik, in fact, injured himself only some yards away from where Dilip Vengsarkar and his colleagues (Easts Ranjib Biswal didnt attend the meeting for personal reasons) were deliberating on Monday afternoon.         
	As the extent of Kartiks injury wasnt known by the time the meeting finished, the selectors named him in the 14 for the first two Tests against South Africa, with leggie Piyush Chawla as a standby for Kartik and Harbhajan Singh.         
	However, a scan brought bad news: That Kartik would be out for three-four weeks. The tear may take even longer to heal.         
	Chawla, therefore, comes into the squad straightaway.         
	Vengsarkar and Co. must now select a standby for Harbhajan. The offie, who didnt turn up for Sundays fitness test at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore, has now been asked to appear on Friday.         
	Harbhajan has, of course, already declared himself fit.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni too has to undergo a fitness test that day.         
	Meanwhile, Ishant Sharma hasnt been picked, but could be added to the squad for Test No.2 if hes fit when a fresh evaluation is done at the Academy.         
	The first fitness test too was at the Academy, on Sunday.         
	Ishant may become the 15th player for Ahmedabad if theres a fresh fitness test at the Academy and hes found to be one hundred per cent fine, pointed out one of the selectors.         
	The lanky Delhi quick could be evaluated afresh at some point during the first Test, in Chennai, from March 26. The second begins on April 3, while the third and final one (in Kanpur) gets underway on April 11.         
	Ishant, who made a huge impact in Australia, is recovering from injuries to his left big toe and right middle finger. That he was doubtful in the lead-up to the selection committee meeting was reported in these columns on Monday.         
	Despite being a big flop in Australia, Wasim Jaffers performance in the last home series, versus Pakistan, helped him keep one of the openers berths.         
	That scuttled the in-form Gautam Gambhirs chance of making another comeback at the highest level. He would still, perhaps, have made it had the selectors chosen 15 and not 14 players.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, captain Anil Kumble favoured whats being viewed as a conservative selection.  
	THE SQUAD  
	 Openers: Virender Sehwag, Wasim Jaffer
  Middle-order batsmen: Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh
  Wicketkeeper: Mahendra Singh Dhoni
  Spinners: Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Piyush Chawla
  Medium-pacers: Irfan Pathan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Sreesanth
  Note: Dhoni and Harbhajan have to undergo a fitness test on Friday. Dinesh Karthik is the standby for Dhoni while Harbhajan rsquo;s is yet to be named. May not be necessary, though.

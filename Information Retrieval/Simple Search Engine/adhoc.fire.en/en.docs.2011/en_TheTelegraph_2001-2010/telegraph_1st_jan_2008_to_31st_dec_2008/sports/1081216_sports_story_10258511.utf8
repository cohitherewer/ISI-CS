The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | This 100 is very special: Sachin
                                                                                                                                                                                                     This 100 is very special: Sachin
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar on Monday rated his unbeaten 103 as one of the best innings and placed it alongside the Perth hundred of 1992.               
	The following are excerpts               
	If they had memories of the 1999 loss against Pakistan (India lost by 12 runs after Sachin got out) on their minds         
	Yes... Actually we had that discussion. I told Yuvraj (Singh) when he played a shot off Monty (Panesar) that landed between short mid wicket and long on, wait till the last run is scored. We need to make sure that both of us complete the runs.         
	If he had overcome the disappointments of Barbados and the Test versus Pakistan here in 1999         
	The disappointments are there and they will be there. What you can make sure is that you dont repeat the same thing in the future. I feel extremely happy and proud that I have been able to achieve something very special.         
	Reaching a hundred and scoring the winning runs         
	This is something that I wanted to do. Score a 100 in the fourth innings and win a match for India. Ive scored a 100 in the second innings, but to actually win a match, play the winning shot That was something I wanted to do. This makes it really really special.         
	On how he rates this hundred and what he told Yuvraj once he joined him         
	I would rate this hundred as one of the best, for sure. The win makes it even more special To Yuvraj I said dont be tense. People have been talking about whether Yuvraj is a Test player or not and I think those are just loose statements. He is a terrific player who has got important runs and three Test hundreds. Today he again proved all the people wrong         
	If he rates this hundred as better than the one in Perth in 1992         
	I would put this one right up there given the circumstances and the surface, the weather and the target. I would rate this as one of the top ones.         
	If touring teams will have to rethink strategies on setting targets against India         
	Its a good thing that we have achieved a target of 387. A lot of times the team is unable to achieve a target but that doesnt mean the batsmen are not trying. Sometimes there are failures. It is not something that happens often.         
	Rahul Dravids form         
	The bad patch that Rahul is going through happens to everybody. There is nothing to worry about. He is not just a good player, hes a great player. He will definitely score runs.         
	The mood when Sehwag went bang bang         
	We are quite used to that. You kind of expect something which is not expected. When Viru is batting it is always entertaining and full of surprises. He set it up brilliantly. How many players in the world can do that? Without any doubt, in the end, it was Virus contribution that mattered. Very few people in the world can do what he does.

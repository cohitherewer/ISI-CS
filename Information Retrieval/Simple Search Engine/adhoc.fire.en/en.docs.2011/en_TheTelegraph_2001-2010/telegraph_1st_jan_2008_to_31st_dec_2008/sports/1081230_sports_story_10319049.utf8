The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Balaji happy with show
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Balaji happy with show
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: Laxmipathy Balaji attributed Tamil Nadus come from behind victory in the Ranji Trophy quarter finals against Bengal to team spirit and self belief.         
	Last evening in the team meeting I told the boys that I will give my best and asked them to give their best in the first session. I am glad we backed each other and that I could do what I did, said Balaji, who has captured 31 wickets in six matches this season.         
	Balaji, who is determined to return to the national side, compared this mornings spell (8-5-7-5) to his devastating bowling against Pakistan (4/63 and 3/108 at Rawalpindi, 2004). I would say this is the best I have bowled at home. I would compare it to the spell against Pakistan in 2004. I am happy that I have regained my rhythm, said Balaji.         
	Talking about the surgery on his back, Balaji said: It was tough time. But my coach (Raman), family and friends believed that I could bowl again. Once the bio-mechanics of my bowling action were sorted out, I was comfortable. I thank all those who helped me.         
	W.V. Raman commended Balaji for the destructive spell which broke Bengals back in the morning session. With due regard to the other bowlers, I knew only Balaji could bowl us into the game, said Raman.

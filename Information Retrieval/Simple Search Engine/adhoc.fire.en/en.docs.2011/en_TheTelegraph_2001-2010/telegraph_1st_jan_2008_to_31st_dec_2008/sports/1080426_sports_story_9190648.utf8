The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Riders, Kings in crucial battle
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Riders, Kings in crucial battle
  - We rsquo;ve got bowlers for all conditions: former Team India captain
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Sourav Ganguly                           
	Chennai: At the annual Wisden dinner in the Long Room at Lords earlier this month, former England captain and president of MCC Mike Brearley spoke in favour of the games shortest version. This is proper cricket without the boring bits Twenty20 is here to stay. It should be welcomed, he said.         
	A week into the Indian Premier League theres no doubt the concept is fast catching on. The tournament is being keenly followed, it is creating a storm over the cuppa and the masses have taken to it as fish takes to water.         
	In keeping with the hype surrounding the event, Chennai has been no different. Tickets for Chennai Super Kings clash with Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday were sold out long ago. No wonder the black marketeers are having a field day.         
	With two wins in as many matches for both sides, the contest could well boil down to Chennai Super Kings batsmen versus Knight Riders bowlers. The visitors are sure to feel the pressure against a balanced batting line-up that includes the likes of Matthew Hayden and Michael Hussey.         
	Outside support will also be thin with the absence of Shah Rukh Khan and his en         
	tourage, a key feature in Knight Riders previous two games in Bangalore and at the Eden. Forget Knight Riders, the entire Chennai will miss Shah Rukh, Sourav Ganguly said.         
	The megastar, though, hasnt forgotten to convey his best wishes to the captain and the coach on Friday evening. But theres no doubt that his vocal presence has been a huge inspiration and enough to send the adrenaline pumping for his team.         
	On the field, there will be several battles  Sourav versus Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Hayden versus Ishant Sharma, Ricky Ponting versus Muttiah Muralidharan and the contest between the Hussey brothers, Michael and David.         
	The Knight Riders captain is not willing to be swayed by all this. Whoever plays well on the given day will prevail, Sourav said, dismissing all talk of form and fitness.         
	Knight Riders are likely to retain the same XI that played the previous two games. The evening nets, after having arrived from Calcutta on Friday morning, was dedicated to sharpening the batting skills. Coach John Buchanan would be hoping to make the most of the hosts bowling blues, a fact acknowledged by Kepler Wessels. The Chennai teams coach knows that apart from Murali, no other bowler has delivered. We need to improve our bowling, specially at the death, Wessels said.         
	The 4pm start will mean that the dew, prevalent during the late evening hours, will not have much role to play.         
	The absence of Shah Rukh may act as a dampener for those hoping to see him in person but there will be no dearth of fun and frolic. Shivamani and his troupe will be present to add to the grandeur. And despite the controversies, the cheerleaders will rock a million hearts.

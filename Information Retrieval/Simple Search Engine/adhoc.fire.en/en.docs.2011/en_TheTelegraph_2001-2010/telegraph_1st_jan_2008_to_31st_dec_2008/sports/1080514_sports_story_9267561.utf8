	London: Turkish Grand Prix organisers could face sanctions after two stray dogs ran onto the Istanbul track and one was hit by Brazilian Bruno Sennas car during a support race on Sunday. This was a serious lapse in circuit security and safety, an FIA spokesman said on Monday. The FIA Safety Commission will hold a full investigation into the matter which may then be referred to the world council.    
	Senna, nephew of Ayrton Senna, ran over one of two dogs on the track during a GP2 race at the Istanbul Park circuit. The 24-year-old, who had come over the brow of a hill and had only a fraction of a second to react, was lucky to escape serious injury with the impact breaking his front right suspension.      
	London: A man was held by German police for blackmailing Force India driver Adrian Sutil, according to reports. Between the Spanish and Turkish Grands Prix, a man asked for money from Sutil in exchange for an old computer hard drive having private information about the driver. The hard-drive had nothing to embarrass the 25-year-old driver, but it had Sutils personal details. All my contacts, my friends, my pictures. All my life was on it. You can imagine how bad it is. It doesnt matter what is on there but its my personal things and thats it, he said.      
	Nottingham: Alex Ferguson was selected as Englands manager of the year on Monday night by his coaching colleagues  24 hours after claiming his 10th Premier League title with Manchester United. The 66-year-old, who has managed United for the past 22 seasons, last received the honour by the League Managers Association in 1999 when he guided the Reds to the treble of the Premier League, European Champions League and English FA Cup.        
	Tokyo: Japans JEF United Chiba are planning an audacious swoop for England striker Michael Owen, Japanese media reported on Tuesday. The J-League club have just unveiled former Liverpool first-team coach Alex Miller as their new manager and believe Owen can solve the teams current goal-scoring problems. Japans Nikkan Sports reported that Chiba officials were preparing an initial approach and that contact had been made with Owens agent Tony Stephens.       
	Sheffield: Sheffield United has offered help to the victims of the earthquake in Chinas Sichuan province, which has a team owned by the English soccer club. United owns the Chengdu Blades from the provincial capital, which is close to the epicentre of Mondays quake that has killed almost 12,000 people with thousands more missing.    
	United chairman Kevin McCabe, on a business trip to Australia, hopes to fly to the disaster scene. He said that players and staff from the Chengdu Blades would be donating blood to help the survivors and would visit schools affected by the earthquake.        
	Rabat: Roger Lemerre was named Morocco coach on Tuesday. The Moroccan soccer federation said the Frenchman would take over on July 1.    
	Lemerre led France to the 2000 European Championship title before coaching the Tunisian national team for six years. He left Tunisia after they lost in the African Cup of Nations quarter finals in February.     
	He takes over from Henri Michel of France, who left after Morocco was knocked out at the African Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No directive to selectors, says Shah
                                                                                                                                                                                                     No directive to selectors, says Shah
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah has confirmed a report in The Telegraph that a directive wont be issued to pick a young Team India for the Jue 8-14 tri-series in Bangladesh. The selection is in Mumbai on Friday.         
	He, however, said that the tournament was an ideal platform for trying out new players. Theres going to be no directive, but this tournament seems ideal to take some risk by including new players in the team, Shah said in Mumbai.         
	Speculation is already on about the chances of seniors like Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, who were omitted for the last tri-series in Australia, being included in the squad.         
	Asked about reports that Sachin Tendulkar may not be available for the tri-series, the BCCI secretary said that the selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar would be the one to know this.         
	When contacted Vengsarkar said no one had got in touch with him to say that Sachin wasnt available for the tri-series. Sachin missed the second and third home Tests against South Africa and the first seven IPL ties for Mumbai Indians because of a groin injury.

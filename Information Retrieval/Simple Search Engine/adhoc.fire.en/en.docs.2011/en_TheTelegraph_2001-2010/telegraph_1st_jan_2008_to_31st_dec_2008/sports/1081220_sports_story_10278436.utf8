The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia to miss final
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bhutia to miss final
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will miss the services of Bhaichung Bhutia in the Federation Cup final against Dempo Sports Club on Sunday. The India captain was ruled out of the match after an MRI was on Friday.         
	Bhaichung has been ruled out of the final and may be out for two weeks, Karim Bencharifa, the Mohun Bagan coach, said.         
	Bhaichung has not been in great form of late, but has been a regular in the first XI for the Federation Cup, unlike the Calcutta Football League, when he was out of the side in most of the matches with injury.         
	Bencharifa said that Anand Vasan would also miss the final with injury.         
	Meanwhile, Bagan wrote a letter to the All India Football Federation on Friday, objecting to the crammed schedule of the Federation Cup.         
	The green-and-maroon brigade will be playing their fifth match in nine days when they take on Dempo on Sunday at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	We are astonished and worried as to how AIFF can make such a schedule and that, too, for a prestigious tournament like the Federation Cup.         
	There isnt an element of professionalism in the manner the schedule was made, Mohun Bagan wrote in the letter to the AIFF.         
	It added that Bagan players had very little recovery time between the matches. The players are physically and mentally fatigued and have had practically no time to recover from their injuries or stress.         
	Moreover, niggling injuries can turn serious and might threaten the career of a footballer but we have no other option but to field these half-fit players for the final, it added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev tied 21st, Chopra misses cut
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev tied 21st, Chopra misses cut
                      
	Augusta: A gutsy Jeev Milkha Singh overcame back nine blues and turned in a card of two-over 74 to be tied 21st at the halfway stage of the Masters here.         
	Jeev thus maintained his perfect Masters record where he is now two-for-two for cuts made in the years opening major.         
	Close friend Daniel Chopra, however, was not that lucky and a disastrous second round of six-over 78 soured the Masters debut of the Swede of Indian origin.         
	It was also the end of the road for Liang wen-Chong and an injured Prayad Marksaeng, who along with Jeev, had received a special invitation for the major.         
	Asias No. 1 Liang carded a 78 to bow out in his Masters debut while Thailands Prayad retired after nine holes with a back injury. With a 36-hole total of one-over 145, Jeev joined a group of eight, also including US Open champion Angel Cabrera and British Open winner Padraig Harrington, in 21st place.         
	Jeev battled tough playing conditions at Augusta National Golf Club, turning in 35 before making three bogeys.         
	Despite the struggle, Jeev is determined to move into the top-15 by the end of the week to ensure a return trip to next years Masters.         
	I drove the ball poorly. I was disappointed with that and lost confidence on the back nine. I tried to hit it too hard with my driver and I think thats what got me. It was one of those things. My rhythm became too quick, he said. (PTI)

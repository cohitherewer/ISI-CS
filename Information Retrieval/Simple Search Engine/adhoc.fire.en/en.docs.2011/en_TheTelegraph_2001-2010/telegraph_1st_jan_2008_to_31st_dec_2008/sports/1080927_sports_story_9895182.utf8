  - Irani Trophy Rest of India sniff victory             Mahendra Singh Dhoni in action on Friday                                 
	Vadodara: Gautam Gambhir (51 not out) offers a glint of hope but a wobbly start to an uphill chase had Delhi precariously poised and they would require a string of extraordinary performances on Saturday to stop Rest of India from lifting the Irani Trophy.         
	The Anil Kumble-led Rest set Delhi a stiff target of 378 on a fast-wearing track and then Zaheer Khans double strikes, including the prized scalp of Virender Sehwag (8), took the sting out of Delhis riposte, reducing them to 113 for three.         
	Gambhir found a gritty ally in Rajat Bhatia (31) and the duo cobbled together 76 runs to steady the ship before the right-hander fell to Harbhajan Singh in the last delivery of the day.         
	Gambhirs unbeaten 51 included eight hits to the fence and Delhis hopes to score another 268 runs for a memorable win would centre around the attacking left-hander.         
	With Aakash Chopra nursing a twisted ankle, Sehwag walked out to open with Gambhir but was back in the hut soon after Zaheer Khan trapped the Delhi captain in the third over of the day.         
	Virat Kohli contributed 16 before departing in the same manner, leaving the side in a precarious situation.

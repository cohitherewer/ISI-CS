                                                                                                                                                                                           BCCIs no to counties with ICL players
                      
	New Delhi: Flexing its muscle, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) today made it clear that English counties having players from the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) would not be allowed to participate in the inaugural Champions Twenty20 Tournament to be held in India in September-October.         
	The BCCI working committee, which met here, decided that English counties with ICL players would be barred from the $10 million event, to be run and managed by the BCCI which will have 50 per cent stake in the venture.         
	The tournament will feature top two teams from the domestic Twenty20 tournaments from Australia, Pakistan, South Africa and England, besides India.         
	The working committee approved the proposal to jointly organise the Champions T20 Tournament in late September and early October (this year) involving Australia, South Africa, India and Pakistan. Clubs from England who qualify can play provided the teams do not include players who are with ICL, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said.         
	BCCI vice-president and Indian Premier League commissioner Lailt Modi issued a veiled threat to the England Cricket Board (ECB) saying that BCCI will not participate in any tournament, which will have ICL players in it.         
	The rules and structure of the tournament will be framed by Cricket Australia while BCCI, which will be 50 per cent partner in the venture, will run and manage it.         
	But BCCIs participation is 100 per cent dependent on no participation by ICL players in that tournament. he said.         
	Modi said the working committee took up a proposal sent by ECB regarding their problem on this issue, but the BCCI would stick to its stand.         
	Asked whether there is a possibility that ECB may not take part in the event because of this issue, Modi retorted: That is for the ECB to decide. If that is the case, it will be very sad.         
	The prize pool of the tournament will be $10 million. The winner will get $5 million, the losing finalist $2.5 million and the two semi-finalists will pocket $1.25 million each.         
	Asked about the availability of players for the tournament because of the crammed international schedule, Modi said only a couple of national team players will be involved in the short tournament.         
	In another decision, Delhi has been awarded a Test match in Australias four-match Test series tour to India starting October 9.           (PTI)

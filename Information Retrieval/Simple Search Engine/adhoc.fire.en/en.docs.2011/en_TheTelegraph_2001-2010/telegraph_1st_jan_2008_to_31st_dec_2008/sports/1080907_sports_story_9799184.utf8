                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sayantan is sole leader
            A CORRESPONDENT            Sayantan Das                           
	Calcutta: Second seed Sayantan Das of Scottish Church emerged as the sole leader with 7 points after the completion of round VII of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Alekhine Chess Club on Saturday.         
	Snapping at his heels was Girish Kaushik of Karnataka, half a point adrift, on 6.5 points. Sayantan got the better of Chandrashish Majumder of St Xaviers with the white pieces in the 6th round and then outwitted the highest rated girl, Pallabi Roy of Indira Gandhi Memorial High School in the seventh.         
	Sayantan now sat pretty at the top of the table. He will meet Girish Koushik in a crucial encounter in the next round which might well be the championship decider.         
	Incidentally, in the recently concluded National U-11 at Ahmedabad, Kaushik had drawn against Sayantan. Top seed Satyajit Kundu of Vivekananda Mission School was held to a draw by the Asian U-10 champion Diptayan Ghosh of South Point. Earlier in the morning, Satyajit was held by Girish Kaushik in an irregular Queens pawn opening.

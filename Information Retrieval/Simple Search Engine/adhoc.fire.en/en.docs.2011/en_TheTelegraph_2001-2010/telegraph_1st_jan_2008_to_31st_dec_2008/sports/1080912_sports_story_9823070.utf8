The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Advani wants more
                                                                                                                                                                                             Advani wants more
            SUDIPTO CHOWDHURY            Pankaj Advani                           
	Calcutta: Winning has become a habit for him. Six world titles, two Asian titles, an Asian Games gold, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award and above all the second IBSF World Billiards Championship (the first title was at Qawra, Malta in 2005), clearly, twenty-three old Arjuna awardee Pankaj Advani wants more.         
	On Thursday evening the champion cueist spoke to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Records and Pankaj Advani are synonymous these days. How would you like to describe being the first-ever in the world to win a double?         
	A Its always great to set records. I want to keep this going. Actually, a record was set even in Malta in 2005 when I won my first double as no one had ever won it previously.         
	How did you prepare yourself before the World meet?         
	It was not a planned effort. I just played my game. I practise for about four hours a day at the KSBA And at times it stretches to six hours too. Being on the table for four to six hours requires a lot of stamina and for that I also gym in the mornings to keep myself fit.         
	In 2005, you clinched a double at Qawra, Malta, beating Devendra Joshi. Did that experience help you this time?         
	Three years is a long time. Joshi and I have had many interesting matches and the good thing is we have always enjoyed them. In billiards, once you play the first shot, after your opponent has left the table, you are the one responsible for the position of the balls from then on. So, you actually play yourself. You are your biggest opponent.         
	Now after winning the two titles, what next?         
	Add more to the kitty!!         
	So would you like to be called Indias next Geet Sethi?         
	Geet Sethi is a phenomenal player and has proved his mettle over a period of about 25 years. He is still performing brilliantly and will play on for many more years. I am happy to remain Indias Pankaj Advani, who has won six world titles, two Asian titles, an Asian Games gold and the Khel Ratna by the age of 23.         
	How much will this win help your career? And in a larger sense, what will be its effect on sports in the country?         
	After our achievements in shooting, boxing and wrestling  all individual sports  at the Olympics, I think my double victory in yet another individual sport, will have some positive effect on the sport scenario in the country. If corporate houses would adopt one sport each, freeing sport from bureaucratic red tape, I feel we can shine at all international sporting events, year in year out.         
	Isnt it a bit demoralising given the little importance and attention given to billiards in the country?         
	It is a sad state of affairs, however, as sportspersons we can only strive to excel in performance and win titles for our country. Unfortunately we were not taught marketing skills during sports training !!!! (smiles)         
	In the next five years, where would you like to see yourself in terms of billiards?         
	I would like to maintain my present position.         
	Finally, your message to the emerging billiards players of the country         
	Billiards is called the Mother of Cue Sports. A good billiards performance is like poetry in motion  the smooth gentle strokes coupled with the fine touch on the ball gives this game a supreme elegance not seen in many other sports. In sport, you should always do what you love and not try to love what you do.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohammedan Sportings Madhab Das and Mir Farooq Hyder try to check Churchill Brothers players during the I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Picture by Gautam Bose                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting wasted a handful of chances as Churchill Brothers managed to hold on to a Okolie Odafe goal to win after four matches in the ONGC I-League on Sunday.         
	A costly mistake by Naseem Akhtar in the 70th minute allowed Odafe to score the only goal in the match at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Win this win, the Goan team are back in the title race. They have 17 points from 10 matches. Mohammedan Sporting stayed in the relegation zone with nine points from as many matches.         
	The Mohammedan Sporting custodian  who was otherwise impressive under the bar  failed to fist away an ordinary cross, letting the ball reach Bineesh Balan.         
	The winger managed to turn the ball towards the goal but it came off the post and reached a waiting Odafe, who made no mistake. The defence was left stranded and failed to react.         
	Mohammedan Sporting were left to rue their missed chances. The home teams foreigners  Theodore Sunday and Mike Okoro  missed easy chances in either half to let the team down.         
	Okoro failed to do justice to a brilliant overhead lob from Goutam Thakur in the 20th minute. The Ghanaian made a mess of the chance, sending a first-time right-footer straight into the hands of Churchill goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya. Okoro, who was unchallenged, should have done better.         
	Theodore Sunday, who didnt look 100 per cent fit from the start, wasted a brilliant opportunity in the 67th minute. The Liberian beat his marker with a superb turn but failed to keep his shot down as it went soaring over the crosspiece.         
	Sunday, whose right knee was heavily strapped, was seen limping on a quite a few occasions. He should have been replaced earlier than the 76 minutes he was on the field.         
	Vimal Pariyar, who was brought in as a replacement for Sunday, failed to beat the goalkeeper from six yards in the dying moments of the match.         
	Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali was visibly frustrated with the missed chances after the match.         
	Its not good for us. Were missing easy chances Its hurting us a lot, Shabbir said. We conceded a bad goal today But we didnt play badly.         
	The coach also defended his decision to keep an unfit Sunday on the field for 79 minutes. I was thinking Theo would do something. I played him due to the lack of options, he said.         
	Churchill coach Zoran Djordjevic was elated with the hard-earned win. He also voiced his ire against the quality of referring in the I-League blaming the officials for not letting his team win in the last four matches.         
	Today I am very happy Believe me, I was very sad in the last four games, he said.         
	I showed that my team are capable of becoming champions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal muscles past Blake, in semis
                                                     Nadal muscles past Blake, in semis
                  Rafael Nadal after defeating James Blake on Wednesday                     
	Miami: World No. 2 Rafael Nadal powered to a 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 victory over James Blake on Wednesday to reach the semi-finals of the Sony Ericsson Open.         
	Nadal defeated his American rival for the first time in his career at the Pacific Life Open quarter finals two weeks ago and replicated the feat on Wednesday.         
	Right now I am feeling like I am playing at my best level, so thats important, to come to the clay season with more confidence, Nadal told reporters.         
	He started (out) playing so aggressive. I didnt have many chances in the beginning. I couldnt touch the ball. I couldnt get rhythm in the beginning  nothing.         
	Blake made far too many mistakes during the one hour, 55 minute contest, producing 31 unforced errors compared with just 13 for second seed Nadal. The American also offered Nadal 19 opportunities to break his serve, the triple French Open champion successfully doing so four times in total.         
	Nadal turned the match in his favour when he broke the ninth-seeded Blake with a sizzling backhand passing shot to go 5-3 up in the second set. He greeted the break with his trademark fist pump and from then on Blakes challenge faded.         
	This one was a little more disappointing, Blake said.         
	Last week I feel like I played my game. Just didnt play it well enough last week.         
	This week I felt like I played my game for a while, and then I got a little indecisive.         
	Nadal will play 10th seed Tomas Berdych in the semi-finals after the Czechs 6-4, 6-4 victory over Russias Igor Andreev.         
	There is no time for celebrating, said Berdych. I just need to recover for the next match and be ready for Rafa.         
	In womens action, Jelena Jankovic reached the semi-finals after world No. 11 Elena Dementieva retired with a back injury on Wednesday. Jankovic was suffering badly from a cold but did not have to stay on court too long as Dementieva quit midway through the second set.         
	Jankovic will play world No. 20 Vera Zvonareva after the Russian earned a 7-5, 6-4 win over Dinara Safina. Defending champion Serena Williams will take on Svetlana Kuznetsova in the other semi-final.         
	Serbian Jankovic was leading 6-1, 3-1 when Dementieva, who had her injury treated on court earlier in the match, decided she could not carry on.         
	Im fighting. Im sick, Jankovic told reporters. I cannot play, I cannot breathe on the court. I dont want to go on to the court. But Im hanging in there and trying to be strong.         
	Im more focused than usual because I know that Im not 100 per cent with my health. Im coughing a lot. My nose is running.           (REUTERS)

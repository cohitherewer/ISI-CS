The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag owes it to Kumble
                                                   Sehwag owes it to Kumble
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Virender Sehwag dedicated his latest triple hundred to his late father and the family, but he couldve added Anil Kumbles name.         
	Sehwag, after all, probably wouldnt have been playing for Team India at this point in time had the Test captain not pitched for him very strongly when the squad for Australia was picked in Bangalore last December.         
	The dasher from Najafgarh hadnt been among the 24 probables but made a comeback almost wholly thanks to Kumble.         
	An injury to Gautam Gambhir created a vacancy and it came down to either Sehwag or Aakash Chopra (both of whom, like Gambhir, play for Delhi) being the replacement.         
	Chopra was one of the probables but when the ball was lobbed in Kumbles court, he went for Sehwag.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Kumble said there was no comparison and that the pace at which Sehwag could score remained unmatched.         
	His USP, in fact.         
	Sehwag didnt play the first two Tests (Melbourne, Sydney) because Yuvraj Singh had to be accommodated but made a comeback in Perth. He didnt score many in the first innings but made a very effective 43 in the second.         
	That innings contributed to a momentous victory and Sehwag followed it up with 63 and a superb 151 in the fourth and final Test, in Adelaide.         
	Sehwag hardly got a game in the tri-series which followed but didnt sulk. Rather, he conserved his energy for the South Africans.         
	The rest is, well, history.

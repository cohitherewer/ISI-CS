                                                                                                                                                                                                     India-born wrestler in Australia squad
                      
	Melbourne: India-born wrestler Sandeep Kumar created history by becoming the first foreign-origin sportsperson to make the cut for the Australian Olympic-bound contingent.         
	Sandeep, 25, who migrated to Australia four years ago as he was disillusioned by the state of sports administration in India, will be competing in the 85kg freestyle division in the quadrennial event in Beijing, according to a report in Australias broadcasting service.         
	I feel very proud and honoured to represent Australia at the Olympics, said Sandeep. Frustrated with the system, Sandeep, a one-time Punjab Police constable, landed in Australia on the invitation of Kuldip Bassi, founder and president of the United Wrestling Club (UWC) in Melbourne.         
	They can force the wrestler to lose against an opponent If they dont then they can be punished in some other way. I saw it happen in India. I saw it happening against Sandeep, coach Bassi said.         
	Though Sandeep will be representing Australia in Beijing, sponsorship has been hard to come by and still remains a concern for the young wrestler. He supports his daily expenses by driving a taxi.         
	Im driving full-time but I need more rest  , Sandeep said.         
	Wrestling is very tough as you need enough power in your legs, hands, chest and stomach, he added.         
	The youngest of four children, Sandeeps older brother Anil, also a wrestler, introduced him to the sport at the age of eight.         
	At 15, Sandeep turned professional. He proved his talent from a very early age, winning numerous championships.         
	In 1997, a teenaged Sandeep won a gold medal at the Russian championships. He is the three-time winner of the Australian Asian Championships and has won the Australia Cup, a wrestling competition hosted by the UWC.         
	His father strongly encouraged him to pursue the sport as a career.         
	In India, we got good money and government jobs as well. Thats why I decided to pursue my career in sport, he told a website.         
	But Sandeep was not selected to represent India despite his achievements. Disillusioned, he was forced to leave India. I could have made India proud, he said. But I didnt get the chance.         
	While training in a Punjab wrestling club four years ago, Bassi handpicked Sandeep. Technically he was the most talented, and a smart wrestler too, his coach said.         
	I saw he could do better and I thought that if he came to Australia he would have a good future, he could make a good name for himself, the club and the standard of Australian wrestling, he added.         
	Sandeep trains with Bassi and a Russian wrestling coach twice a day.           (AGENCIES)

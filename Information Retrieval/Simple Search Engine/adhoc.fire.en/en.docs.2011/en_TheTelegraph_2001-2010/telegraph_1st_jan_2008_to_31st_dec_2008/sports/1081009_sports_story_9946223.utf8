	Tokyo: Felipe Massa warned championship leader Lewis Hamilton on Wednesday that the fight for the Formula One title will rage all the way to the wire.         
	The Brazilian trails his McLaren rival by seven points with three races left but promised to give the Briton a battle at this weekends Japanese Grand Prix. This season we have shown good mental strength after bad performances, Massa said. Theres still 30 points to fight for.         
	We will definitely not give up. We will fight until the last lap of the last race. Thats all I have on my mind now.         
	Massas title hopes suffered a severe blow after a botched pitstop meant he finished 13th in Singapore two weeks ago.         
	However, Massa insisted he was more than capable of bursting Hamiltons bubble at Fuji Speedway. (REUTERS)

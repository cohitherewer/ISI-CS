The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjun Atwal stumbles on final day
                                                Arjun Atwal stumbles on final day
                              
	Panama City: Arjun Atwals hopes of ending his long title drought went up in smoke at the Panama Movistar Championship on the Nationwide Tour on Sunday.         
	The overnight leader finished tied second after a nightmarish final round with an aggregate of two-under 278.         
	Atwal, who used to be a PGA Tour regular, began by picking up a shot on the opening hole. After that, however, nothing went right and he turned in his worst card of the week  a four-over 74.         
	Scott Dunlap came from behind to capture his second Nationwide Tour title. Jeff Klauk carded a 69 to share second place with Atwal.         
	The Orlando-based Indian stuttered on a treacherous front nine with the fifth hole marking the beginning of a bogey hattrick and he dropped one more shot on the ninth to take the turn at three-over.         
	Atwal did not make another birdie and another dropped shot on the 15th scuttled his hopes of forcing a play-off.           (PTI)

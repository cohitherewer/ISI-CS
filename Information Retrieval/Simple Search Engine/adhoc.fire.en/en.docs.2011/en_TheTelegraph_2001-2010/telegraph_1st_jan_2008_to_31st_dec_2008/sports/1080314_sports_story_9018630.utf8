                                                   Chopra: Im not only a Test player
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Mumbai: Seasoned Delhi opener Aakash Chopra, whos working hard towards an India comeback, and Saurashtras promising Cheteshwar Pujara, have joined the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Speaking during the occasion in Mumbai, Test discard Chopra lashed out at critics who dubbed him as purely a Test batsman.         
	In India, we tend to stereotype people Certain batsmen are good for Test cricket only and wont be suitable for other formats, Chopra said, defending his selection for the Sourav Ganguly-led side in Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	IPL has given me the opportunity to prove the critics wrong and make a statement he added.         
	Meanwhile, Les Burdett, the curator of Adelaide Oval, said the wickets for the IPL matches wont be totally batting friendly, another report adds from Jaipur.         
	We want uniform wickets. We dont want a batsman getting out due to bad bounce but also do not want a bowler to suffer because of flat track.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal makes most of home comforts
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nadal makes most of home comforts
          Mark Hodgkinson            Rafael Nadal                                 
	Rafael Nadal hasnt just spent the last few days in Roger Federers head, he has also been back home in Majorca, where the Wimbledon champion has been swimming at the beach with his girlfriend and showing his replica trophy to his fellow islanders. Majorca is where Nadal feels happiest, where he can play leisurely rounds of golf and fish off the coast for tuna and these precious few days of relaxation will be crucial if he is to win Olympic gold or the US Open.         
	When Nadal was in London during the Wimbledon Championships, he came out of a restaurant one evening to be confronted by eight paparazzi. It is only when he is back in Majorca that the 22-year-old feels like a normal person.         
	Majorca is my favourite place in the world, as I have my family and friends there, and thats where I grew up, Nadal said. Thats the place for me.         
	The Spaniards family are from inland Manacor, the second largest town on the island after Palma, the capital and the world No. 2 continues to make Majorca his home. In Manacor, hes just Rafa, not the It-boy of mens tennis.         
	In Manacor, people have known me since I was a little kid, Nadal added.         
	They congratulate me when I win something, but treat me like everybody else. I have the same plans for my life as everybody else. I just want to be happy. Im a simple boy, really. I just like simple things.         
	Nadals annoyance at the London paparazzi was particularly informative. Im a public figure, I understand, but I dont live off publicity. I live off what I do on the court. I work there.         
	So there is absolutely no chance of Nadals Wimbledon win turning the Majorcan into a regular of the red-carpet scene quite the opposite.         
	Nadal is far too classy, far too sensible to have ambitions of joining the Hello-ocracy.         
	Nadals family and in particular his uncle and coach, Toni, have always ensured that the young man does not get ideas above his station.         
	Toni Nadal once told his nephew that his skill at hitting a tennis ball should not make him think that he was better than his public. This is a future world No. 1 who is thoroughly grounded.         
	Still, Nadal is not the first in his family to be in the public eye; his uncle Miguel Angel The Beast of Barcelona  played football for Barcelona and Spain, while his grandfather was the conductor of Manacors band.         
	But Nadal, who learnt to hit the ball at a local club, does not have too much time to spend in his beloved Majorca, as the tennis season is relentless.         
	With all that tennis to be played over the next few weeks and the growing possibility that Nadal will become the world No. 1 for the first time, his few days of rest and relaxation are a welcome respite.         
	Majorca deserves more than a sex, sand and sangria image. It is also where Nadal recharges his batteries.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

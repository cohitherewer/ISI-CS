The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Seems there is more to it: Somnath
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Seems there is more to it: Somnath
                      
	New Delhi: Terming Sourav Gangulys decision to retire after the end of the Test series against Australia as unfortunate, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee on Wednesday said it would be unfair if the decision stemmed from things not related to cricket.         
	It seems that there is more than his ability as a cricketer which has probably prompted him to take this decision, then that is very unfortunate. It is expected that one would get his due and nobody should have a feeling that he has been treated in a manner which has prompted him to call it a day sooner than one would have been happy to..., Chatterjee said.         
	BCCI finance committee chairman Rajeev Shukla said: I would like to make it very clear to Somnathda that there is no pressure from BCCI that he should go for retirement, Shukla said.

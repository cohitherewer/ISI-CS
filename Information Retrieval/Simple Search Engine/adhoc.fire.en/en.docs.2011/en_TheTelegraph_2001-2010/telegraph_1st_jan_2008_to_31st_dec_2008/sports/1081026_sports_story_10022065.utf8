                                                                                                                                                                                                       India is the epicentre of cricket: Greg Chappell
    - I only focus on the job Ive got to do             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Greg Chappell                                 
	Calcutta: Greg Chappell, now 60, avoided giving one-on-ones during his four-week stay in India as assistant coach of the Ricky Ponting-led squad. Before leaving for home, though, the former Team India coach (and one-time Australia captain) spoke to The Telegraph from his New Delhi hotel.         
	There were, of course, a couple of pre-conditions from the recently-appointed head coach at Cricket Australias Centre of Excellence in Brisbane: No questions on individuals and on the ongoing India-Australia series. Basically, the interview had to be on his new role.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q When do you actually start work as the Centre of Excellences head coach?         
	A Being in India for the first two Tests was part of the job... Part of my role is to understand, from time to time, the requirements of the national coach (Tim Nielsen) and the national team... Some planning has commenced for next years programme at the Centre of Excellence... The programme there runs from April to September.         
	Have you moved from Sydney to Brisbane?         
	No... It will be at some point next year, were working on that.         
	What made you take up this job?         
	Its a challenge... Cricket in Australia is going through a rebuilding phase... Some stalwarts have retired, some others are probably close to the end of their careers... Its an interesting period and Ive got the opportunity to work with the next generation. Its an exciting prospect too.         
	Having coached a national team (India), what adjustments will you be making in your new role?         
	Look, the emphasis may be slightly different, but the basics wont change. Indeed, as with the India job or when I coached South Australia, Im looking to add value. Thats why Im there.         
	How many coaches will be working under you?         
	Quite a few... Also, a sports scientist and staff to look after the cricketers fitness.         
	The number of cricketers...         
	The core group will be 15, but at different times, there will be specialist camps for spinners or wicketkeepers or... The age group will be 19 and above... Those who form part of the core group could keep returning to the Centre of Excellence for top-up sessions.         
	Will the Pontings be using the facility?         
	Definitely... For pre-season and/or pre-tour camps... Also, we at the Centre of Excellence will be working closely with the national team whenever theres a Test match in Brisbane, usually the first of the season. (After a pause) Such interaction will help the coaches understand the national teams requirements better and will be a good learning experience.         
	Anything from your nearly two years with Team India that will come in handy?         
	Absolutely... That period was an invaluable experience in my development as a person and as a coach.         
	Will you, off and on, be travelling with the national team?         
	Its possible, though not cast in stone.         
	Without going into specifics, how do you look back on the four weeks you spent with the Pontings in India?         
	Again, an invaluable experience... I got a close feel of Tims requirements, the requirements of the team... The chief selector, Andrew Hilditch, was also around... One could assess the cricketers better.         
	[Hilditch too has gone back and Merv Hughes is his replacement.]         
	The impression is that Australias bench strength isnt all that hot...         
	Time will tell... And, to be honest, I dont know everything about Australias bench strength... Ill be having a better view, over the next four-five months, once I travel around the country and watch the first-class matches.         
	Anything about India that you missed and were happy to catch up with?         
	Look, Ive enjoyed all my visits to India and enjoyed a majority of my experiences... My graph is a succession of experiences, really, most of them quite good... India, clearly, is the epicentre of cricket and the IPL has changed the sports landscape... The Twenty20 game and the IPL have given a new dimension and coaches will have to review their practices.         
	The final one: Despite being designated assistant coach, you were actually seen as a Super Coach. Any thoughts on that?         
	Its the right of the people to think what they want... I havent been focusing on how others perceive my role... Have never done that Im just a coach and Tim and I went about our work in a professional way... I only focus on the job Ive got to do.

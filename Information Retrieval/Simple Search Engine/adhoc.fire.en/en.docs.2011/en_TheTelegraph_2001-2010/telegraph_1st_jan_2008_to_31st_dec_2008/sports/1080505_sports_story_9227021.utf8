	Rome: Rafael Nadals bid to win a record fourth consecutive Rome Masters title next week was boosted on Saturday when he drew an easier path to the final than world No. 1 Roger Federer.         
	If results go to seedings, Spains world No. 2 Nadal will meet eighth seed James Blake in the quarter finals and then face No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko in the semis.         
	Federer, in contrast, is lined up to face world No. 5 David Ferrer in the last eight and a possible semi-final showdown against Australian Open winner Novak Djokovic or Argentinas David Nalbandian.         
	Nadals side of the draw also features Britains Andy Murray and Frances Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who stunned the Spaniard in the semi-finals of the Australian Open.         
	Nadal and Federer both have byes into the second round.         
	After a difficult start to 2008, Nadal has predictably regained his form on clay.

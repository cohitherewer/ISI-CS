The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand at second spot Anand
                                                     Anand at second spot
                    Anand                
	Nice: World champion Viswanathan Anand thumped Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine in the blindfold and won his sixth round game 1.5-0.5 in the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament here.         
	Past the half way stage in this 11-round event that has one rapid and one blindfold game in each round, the Indian ace now occupies sole second spot and has also narrowed the gap between him and leader Levon Aronian of Armenia who played out draws with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan in both games.         
	With five rounds still to go, Aronian is at the top of the combined points table with 7.5 while Anand has seven points in his kitty.         
	Five players are just half a point adrift of Anand at joint third. They are Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, Peter Leko of Hungary, Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and Magnus Carlsen of Norway.         
	Anand misread an opening move in the blindfold game but thankfully there was no damage. Despite the mistake, by the 23rd move the writing was on the wall when Anand played a crushing rook move to tighten the noose.(PTI)

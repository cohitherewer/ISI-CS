The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | MP escape with draw
                                                                                                                                                                                                     MP escape with draw
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bad light conspired to deny Bengal a victory against Madhya Pradesh in their opening match of the Plate group Ranji Trophy campaign in Gwalior on Thursday. Needing 160 in 39 overs, the hosts finished on 63 for six when stumps were drawn.         
	MP got three points from the drawn encounter while Bengal are yet to open their account.         
	A reported spat in the dressing room between Ashok Dinda and Shib Shankar Paul after the third days play threatened to blow out of proportions, but timely intervention by the team management prevented a crisis.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shuklas men were in the dumps for most of the match but staged a remarkable recovery on the final day. The credit should go to Wriddhiman Saha, whose fighting 83 helped the visitors claw back into the match.         
	The bowlers delivered when it mattered. Ranadeb Bose got two early wickets, including the experienced Hrishikesh Kanitkar, to send shock waves through the MP line-up.         
	MP were struggling when bad light forced a premature end. The umpires decided to call it off with MP still having to battle ten more overs.

	Calcutta: Buoyed by their victory over league leaders Dempo in their last match, East Bengal got a reality check on Wednesday as Air India held the city giants to a goalless draw in the ONGC I-League at the Salt Lake Stadium. 
    
	Having taken one point from the match, it was a moral victory for the visitors who took their tally to 16 points. But for East Bengal (12 points from 14 matches), the relegation threat remained with the team lurking in the second-last position in the standings. 
    
	The match not only exposed East Bengals scoring inability, it also highlighted Arnab Das Sharmas marvellous effort under the bar for the visitors. 
    
	Sharmas effort outside the goalpost earned him Man of the Match award. 
    
	East Bengals attack centred around their Brazilian striker Edmilson who almost drew the first blood for his team in the 25th minute but Sharma brought out a brilliant save. 
    
	The Air India goalkeeper with his quick reflexes deflected the powerful Edmilson right-footer much to the home teams agony. 
    
	The first half saw East Bengal dominating with few glimmer of hopes given by substitute Snehasish Chakraborty and Syed Rahim Nabi. 
    
	In the 81st minute, Edmilson got a chance to score but he lost his balance in a tussle with opponents defender Nirmal Chhetri. The referee turned down the penalty.With double booking, Edmilson thus will miss the next East Bengal match.

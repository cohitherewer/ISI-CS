The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SOS for Burdett 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     SOS for Burdett 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal, stung by the criticism of the Eden pitch, has called for an emergency meeting on Tuesday. Besides Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Buchanan, curator Kalyan Mitra, president Prasun Mukherjee and other office bearers of the association will be present.         
	Mukherjee said the CAB had agreed to a proposal from Jai Mehta, the Knight Riders co-owner, that a pitch consultant be brought from overseas to inspect the wicket. Accordingly, an SOS has been sent to the Adelaide Ovals legendary Les Burdett and he will be here once the logistics are sorted out.         
	Team owner Shah Rukh Khan said before leaving the city that he had left it to Buchanan to handle strictly cricketing matters.         
	Deccan Chargers captain VVS Laxman had described the pitch as shocking after the match on Sunday. Australian captain Ricky Ponting also expressed similar views and said Mitra had apologised to the team.         
	The curator came to our dressing room after the match and apologised to all of us. He has promised a better wicket for our next match as also the five other games the team will play at the Eden, Ponting told a TV channel.         
	Burdett, BCCI pitch committee chairman Daljit Singh and Mitra will jointly inspect the pitch and decide on the remedial measures, Mukherjee said.         
	Blaming Mitra is the easiest thing to do but we should also remember that he has done his best, he added.         
	Mitra said he has not been asked to resign.

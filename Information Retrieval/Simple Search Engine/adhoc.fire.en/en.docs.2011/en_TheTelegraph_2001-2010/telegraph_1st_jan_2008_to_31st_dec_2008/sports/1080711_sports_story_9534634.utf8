                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bopanna stuns   top seed Fish
                            
	New Delhi: Indian Davis Cup player Rohan Bopanna pulled off one of the biggest and sensational wins in his career by toppling world No. 41 American Mardy Fish to advance into the singles quarter finals of the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport.         
	This is for the first time that Bopanna has made it to the quarter finals of an ATP event.         
	Qualifier Bopanna, ranked as low as 374, beat the top seed 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 in a gruelling second round contest and would now face Davis Cup teammate and wild card entrant Prakash Amritraj who beat Jesse Levine of the US 7-5, 6-3 in his second round clash on Wednesday.         
	I was not concerned about his rankings. I just played an aggressive game, an elated Bopanna said after his victory         
	Bopanna and Amritraj can also find themselves on the opposite side of court in the doubles event, if they manage to win their quarter final clashes with their respective partners.

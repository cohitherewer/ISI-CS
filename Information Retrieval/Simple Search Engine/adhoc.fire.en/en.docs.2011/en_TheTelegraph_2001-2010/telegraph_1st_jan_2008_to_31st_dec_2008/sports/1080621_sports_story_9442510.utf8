The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Closest meet in years: Malik
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Closest meet in years: Malik
                  Shoaib Malik                     
	New Delhi: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik believes the forthcoming Asia cup would be an open contest with Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka all having equal chances of winning the final.         
	I wouldnt say any team are favourite. India are a strong and balanced side but we showed in the tri-series final they can be beaten. So in a way this Asia Cup I think is going to be the closest one in recent years, Malik told reporters at the National Stadium on Friday.         
	Twenty Pakistani probables began their training in a conditioning camp for the continental tournament with wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal missing from action.         
	The national selectors dropped the experienced Akmal from the short list of players giving a chance to young Sarfraz Ahmed to prove himself.         
	Malik said Pakistans only advantage in the coming tournament would be that they would be playing in home conditions.         
	Other than that all three top teams are balanced and can win on their day. The pitches also dont make much of a difference as there is no dew problem in Karachi at this time of the year even at night time, he said.         
	Malik said with the day light saving scheme in force since June 1, lights would only be switched on in matches at Karachi by the time the first innings ended.         
	Malik said he was expecting high scoring games in the super-four stage from June 28.         
	The June 26 match against India is obviously going to be a big one as they are playing in Pakistan after a while now, he said.         
	Malik dispelled the impression that he had gone out of his way to support Akmals inclusion in the team.         
	That is not true. I think every player in the team knows his place is certain only if he performs well. There is a lot of competition for places.         
	People who say I tried to give advantage to Akmal by sending him in as a makeshift opener in the tri-series in Dhaka forget he has opened before under other captains as well, Malik said.

	St Johns: Australian skipper, Ricky Ponting passed the 10,000 Test runs mark in his characteristic style and Simon Katich scored an unbeaten 113 to put 259 for three on the first day of the second Test on Friday against West Indies.               
	Australia declared their innings at 479 for seven, a little after lunch on the second day. Simon Katich made 113 while Michael Clarke scored 110. Brett Lee remained unbeaten on 63.               
	In front of a woefully small crowd and on a deadly and dull batting track at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Stadium, the tourists went about their business in steady and sensible fashion with Ponting making 65 and then Michael Clark confidently adding 38.         
	It was clear from the first few deliveries of the day from quickies Daren Powell and Fidel Edwards which barely reached the gloves of wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin, that the West Indian attack was going to be in for a long hard day. Katich, whose return to Test cricket in this series comes after nearly three years absence, was badly in need of a score after his failure in both innings at the Sabina Park .         
	The day though belonged to Ponting who became one of the seven batsmen to pass five figures in Test cricket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nothing for me is a No. 2 priority, says Shah Rukh
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nothing for me is a No. 2 priority, says Shah Rukh
  - Bollywood superstar and Knight Riders owner on his life and passions         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                    
	Calcutta: The one and only Shah Rukh Khan spoke to The Telegraph for an hour the other day.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On staying calm despite the truly enormous demand on his time         
	Im dedicated to the work I do, which could also be like giving you this interview Its about staying focused To give an example, if youre concentrating on one spot, you dont see anything else Its a bit like the Arjun story, where he looked at the eye of the fish and didnt see anything else I honestly dont get swayed by anything as Im only concentrating on what Im doing. Right now, youre the eye of the fish for me. Nothing for me is a No.2 priority.         
	Not saying no         
	Look, in my heart, Ive dedicated my life to the people Sometimes I find it too philosophical but thats the way it is Its the people, after all, whove made me what I am I certainly dont claim to be a social worker, yet Ive dedicated my life to the people. Having done that, Ive got to take the good and the bad in my stride. I cant disturb anybody in any way Its like not getting angry with my kids (Aryan, Suhana) I do get angry sometimes but I keep quiet.         
	Whether, generally, he learns from mistakes         
	Call me masochistic or whatever but I believe that if you make a mistake, you should see it with a sense of humour I do things which go wrong but I quickly see the lighter side of that experience Ive been very easy in accepting the fact that perfection isnt attainable, least of all by me Obviously, there will always be the chance that you could go wrong and you accept that Perhaps, Im one of the bigger success stories in the past decade or decade-and-a-half in the country but 90 per cent of the things go wrong People looking at my life from the outside will say shit, everythings going right for Shah Rukh Khan, but I know that 90 per cent of the things go wrong When those are the odds, youve got to enjoy the mistakes Its not about learning from but correcting those mistakes.         
	Having been so passionate about owning the Kolkata Knight Riders, even going to the extent of working till 4-5 in the morning         
	When I first came to Mumbai, many years ago, Id told an interviewer that Id like to have the ISI-like mark on my films That Id like to set a good standard That holds true for whatever I do Be it films, a show on television or owning a cricket team Even before the players were auctioned, I was clear that the Kolkata Knight Riders had to have a certain quality It couldnt have been any other way Whatever the work, there has to be a standard and everybody in my office has to follow that For example, Ill always see off a lady to her car and I expect everybody in my office to do the same. So, there has to be a certain standard where work is concerned, a certain standard of behaviour as well I dont like people to be constricted by a 9-5 or a 10-6 scenario Salaries, hikes If the company can afford it, just go ahead and take whatever you want and be happy Everybody owns the company Thats the way I function. (After a pause) Its easy to climb a hill and feel like a king, but Id rather climb a difficult mountain.         
	Whether, by owning a cricket team, hes making up for not having made it big as a cricketer         
	No No Im not the type to live my dreams through somebody else. Its just that when I was in school and in college, I was more interested and better in soccer and in hockey. Id like soccer the most but was best in hockey Id make it to the cricket teams because of my wicketkeeping abilities.         
	Being a ladies man         
	(Laughs) The reason that women love me is that they see in my eyes that I respect them Id never think of just wanting to bed a woman I love them from my heart         
	His passion outside films and the Knight Riders         
	Im passionate about everything Im passionate about life I prefer writing my own letters, I dont leave them for my secretary As it turns out, 99 per cent of the time I dont have the time and, so, I dont write many letters The other day, my son wanted a picture of Einstein and my wife (Gauri) got one However, I said lets take it off the net and I spent an hour-and-a-half getting one from there I was very passionate in those 90 minutes. Why, Im passionate about brushing my teeth too.         
	Quality time at home         
	Its a must Ill never tell my wife or kids that Im tired Its not their problem.         
	Having danced at weddings as a pro performer         
	I may have to dance more to keep paying for the Kolkata Knight Riders! Im looking for some weddings I dont like to borrow money, I like to earn it Then, I believe in the dignity of labour I dont believe in my image, if I start believing in that, then Im a fool Im just a normal, educated middle-class guy I have no qualms about dancing at weddings It wasnt tough deciding to do so. Remember, I started as a street and theatre actor in Delhi Im a full-fledged performer who learnt his art on the streets. Im Shah Rukh Khan because of what I do.         
	Being a traffic-stopper even in far off Berlin         
	It amazed me I know people love me in Germany but I didnt expect the reception I got (in Berlin) in February That much love was shocking (Adds laughing) I realise people in Calcutta love me a lot more now!         
	Whether criticism hurts him         
	If it comes from somebody who doesnt know my job I mean, I cant criticise an astro-physicist because I just dont know what he does Ive never tried to perfect a role because I believe there should be some rough edges (After a pause) When I do village scenes, my son doesnt like them because hes a modern guy Ive then got to explain that the heart of our country lies in the villages.         
	Entertainers having a shelf life         
	Everything has a shelf life, its more in the mind         
	On dreaming         
	Always do God has been kind, for most of the things Ive dreamt of have come true.         
	His motto         
	Theres always something more to achieve.                     
	First cricket match seen         
	(Enthusiastically) The India versus Pakistan Test at the Kotla in 1979-80 My mother took me to the ground for a day and I remember having lined up for Imran Khans autograph. I think he got out at a critical time and didnt oblige me and a whole lot of others That experience taught me one thing  in times of stress, dont make demands on that person Many years on, I told Imran that hed once refused an autograph         
	His role model wicketkeeper         
	Farokh Engineer He had style, plus Farokh and Shah Rukh kind of rhymed together I also liked Alan Knott, he was so agile Absolutely amazing, really. Later, I found Jeffrey Dujon to be a class act. (After a pause) I wasnt good with the bat but believe me, I was really awesome behind the stumps in school (St Columbas, New Delhi).         
	Last cricket match played         
	In Holland, when the IIFA was held there I captained one of the teams and actually took four wickets with medium-paced bowling Having lost touch with keeping, I stood behind the stumps for just one over Mohammed Azharuddin, by the way, was in my team.         
	Cricketers as entertainers         
	India has got into the phase of the economy of entertainment Its not only about cricketers First comes roti, kapda aur makaan Then, its entertainment and sports as an entertainment. Everything, clearly, has to be an event. If it isnt, then the enjoyment wont be there So, everything has to have an event-creation around it.         
	Having backed Shoaib Akhtar so passionately         
	Id do the same for any member of my team         
	Whether hes sorry that those playing in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) arent eligible for national duty         
	I dont know what stand to take, all I know is that they cant play Some can question the BCCI and some could question the ICL Its the administrators call and I really dont know much about the rules and regulations.         
	The controversy after the India versus Pakistan ODI in Jaipur, last November, when a section within the BCCI accused him of using the match to promote Om Shanti Om         
	People forgot that Id been going to matches for a long time There would be no hype then In fact, Ive even watched non-international matches with my son in Mumbai My mother would take me and, being a movie star, I can take my children with a bit more style. So, why not?         
	On Twenty20 cricket         
	Its exciting Its going to catch on I heard a joke the other day, where cricket gets reduced to Ten10 and, finally, the captains go for the toss only to decide wholl win!         
	Finally, his message for the fans here         
	Please fill the Eden on each of the seven match days A lakh a day would be great Make me feel that Ive made the right choice Imagine a lakh of people singing and chanting korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re and Sourav Ganguly batting (After a pause) Im not into this to make money, I can very well do that through other means.

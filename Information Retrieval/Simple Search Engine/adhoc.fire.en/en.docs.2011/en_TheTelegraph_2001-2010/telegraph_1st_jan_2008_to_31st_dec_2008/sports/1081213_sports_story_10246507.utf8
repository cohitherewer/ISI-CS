	Graeme Swann became the second bowler in Test history to take two wickets in his first over. The other bowler to do so was also an Englishman, Richard Johnson, who dismissed Zimbabwes Mark Vermeulen and Stuart Carlisle at Chester-le-Street in 2003. Vermeulen and Carlisle were dismissed off the third and fourth ball respectively.         
	Sachin Tendulkar (when on 6) became the second Indian batsman and the 27th overall to aggregate 2000 runs against England. Sunil Gavaskar, with 2483, is the only other Indian to do so.         
	Yuvraj Singhs bowling analysis is 15-2-33-1 in this innings. This is the most he has bowled in a single Test innings so far. He had bowled 11-1-39-1 against South Africa in Kanpur earlier this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not worried about runs: Sreesanth
                                                   Not worried about runs: Sreesanth
                      
	Kochi: Sreesanth may have proved expensive during the tri-series in Australia but the firebrand quick says conceding runs never really bothered him since his main job was to take wickets.         
	Sreesanth, who missed the Test series owing to a shoulder injury but was included for the tri-series which India won, picked up only nine wickets and conceded 232 runs in the seven matches he played for an economy rate of 5.75.         
	But the flamboyant fast bowler said he wasnt worried too much about his profligacy.         
	I am basically a wicket-taking bowler. I concentrate on my bowling and not how many runs I concede. My job is to take wickets.           (PTI)

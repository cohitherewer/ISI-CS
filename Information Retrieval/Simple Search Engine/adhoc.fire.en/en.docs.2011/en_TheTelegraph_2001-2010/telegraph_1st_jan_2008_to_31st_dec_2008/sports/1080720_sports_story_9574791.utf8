  -  Sureshs absence a blow for red-and-golds         A STAFF REPORTER            On the eve of the first big clash of the season, rival coaches Manoranjan Bhattacharjee (top) and Shabbir Ali (below) chalk out the last-minute strategies with their players. Telegraph pictures                                         
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will possibly have their best chance to put it across East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. While Mike Okoros side have logged in full points in the two matches they have played, the red-and-gold brigade have won one and drawn the other.         
	Sans eight of their first-XI players due to national commitments  Syed Rahim Nabi, Sunil Chettri, Mehrajuddin, Subrata Paul, Sur Kumar, Rennedy Singh, and the duo of N.P. Pradeep and Stephen Dias  and a foreigner, East Bengal have been struggling to make their mark in the Premier Division of the Sahara Calcutta Football League.         
	My foreigners are my trump card, said Shabbir Ali after practice on Saturday. Shabbir was referring to Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday who have proved to be the livewire for Mohammedan Sporting upfront thus far.         
	Okoro has been playing from slightly deep inside his own territory thereby helping to build attacks, while Sundays role has mainly been limited to the striking zone. Together they form a combination that has been hard to stop. But as Peerless showed in the last match, Sunday can be bottled up through policeman marking.         
	East Bengal, who will be further handicapped by the absence of the injured M. Suresh in their defence, will be hoping to cut the link in their attack by keeping a close tab on Sunday. Satyajit Boses overlapping runs that have often resulted in crosses for Sunday also need to be nipped in the bud. Okoro and Sunday have gelled well, and hopefully, they can turn on the tables, said Shabbir.         
	Shabbir, however, didnt underestimate East Bengal, who he felt have always been a tough opposition in big matches. They have the ability to surprise when down in the dumps. I am happy with the performance of my boys in the two matches. We have limited options but our forwardline has the ability to push their defence.         
	East Bengals main concern will be their defence. Poibang Poshna (under-19) is likely to make his debut. Anupam Sarkar is also set to get his first match this season. Soumik Dey, Anupam, Khelemba Singh and Poshna are likely to be the back-four with Nirmal Chettri acting as the defensive screen to keep Okoro and Sunday under vigil.         
	Manoranjan Bhattacharjee will bank on his attacking medios Mehtab Hossain and Alvito DCunha to mobilise the men upfront.         
	This is a new challenge I dont wish to dwell on the past. Mohammedan Sporting are better placed because of the presence of two foreigners in their ranks, admitted Manoranjan.         
	Such equations, however, dont hold much credence on the field. Its important to show guts and character, the coach added.         
	The out-of-form Ashim Biswas is also a worry. Hes our lone striker now. He will need some time to settle down as he is coming back from knee surgery. Its a concern, but hopefully he will deliver, Manoranjan said.

	KEY MEN  
	 EAST BENGAL  ALVITO D rsquo;CUNHA: The veteran can still turn a match on its head with his game-making and scoring skill. His left foot has to deliver telling passes for the strikers to pounce on. With the nucleus of their side missing because of national commitments, East Bengal will be looking up to him to give them the edge. His experience is also not to be missed in such key matches.  ASHIM BISWAS: He hasn rsquo;t been impressive in the matches East Bengal have played. It is believed that Ashim is woefully out of form but such logic doesn rsquo;t hold true in big clashes. A goal can always change his and the team rsquo;s fortunes. Who knows it could just turn out to be Ashim rsquo;s day!  
	 MD. SPORTING  MIKE OKORO: Mohammedan Sporting rsquo;s captain holds the key to the team rsquo;s success. Playing slightly from inside his territory, he has already impressed with distribution and leadership qualities. That he has not lost any of his scoring abilities was proved during their last match against Peerless when his solo effort fetched his side three points. Such brilliance could tilt the scales in big matches too.  THEODORE SUNDAY: His striking prowess inside the penalty box always makes him a dangerous customer. He has already proved that he can unsettle the opposition with his speed and anticipation. Along with Okoro, he forms a lethal combination upfront. East Bengal better keep a close tab on this Liberian!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Relegation rule to wait   till EB-Viva Kerala tie 
                                                   Relegation rule to wait   till EB-Viva Kerala tie 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The result of the crucial tie between East Bengal and Viva Kerala on Sunday may bring about a twist to the existing relegation rule in the ONGC I-League.         
	Both teams are struggling to avoid relegation, though East Bengal (15 points) are slightly better placed than Viva Kerala (12). Salgaocar are at the bottom with 10 points in the 10-team table. As of now, two teams will face demotion.         
	According to sources, a defeat for Manoranjan Bhattacharjees side may prompt the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to introduce play-offs since neither the top federation officials nor the sponsors will like to see a crowd-pulling team like East Bengal getting relegated.         
	AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi backed the idea of play-offs in the recent executive committee meeting but said that it would only be discussed in the next meeting on February 27.         
	This play-off idea has put the federation in a spot of bother, said a source. Since the Second Division I-League is starting in the middle of March, the federation will have to release the tournament regulations in the next few days. The relegation rule also has to be specified to the participating clubs.         
	It has also been learnt that the federation officials are desperately praying for an East Bengal victory in that they then may survive the relegation threat and also solve the federations problems. In the event of an East Bengal win, a circular may be issued to the executive committee members simply stating that there will be no change in the relegation rule, sources said.         
	Despite Das Munshis efforts, not everyone in the federation seems happy with the play-off concept.         
	A section of the officials, who have been backing the few newly formed company-sponsored clubs, will not mind to see the traditional powerhouses being pushed to the back seat.

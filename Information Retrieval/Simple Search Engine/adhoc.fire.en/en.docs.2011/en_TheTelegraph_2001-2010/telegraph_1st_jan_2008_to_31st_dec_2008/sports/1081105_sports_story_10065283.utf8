                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jankovic, Zvonareva cruise
                      
	Doha: Jelena Jankovic defeated Ana Ivanovic 6-3, 6-4 on Tuesday in round-robin play at the WTAs season-ending Sony Ericsson Championships.         
	Jankovic displayed the composure and consistency that have ensured she will end the year as the top-ranked player.         
	Her Serbian compatriot alternated between spectacular winners and a far greater number of errors, drilling a backhand into the net on match point.         
	Earlier, ninth-ranked Vera Zvonareva defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-2, 6-3 in an all-Russian encounter.         
	Zvonareva handled the windy conditions and a noisy crowd better than Kuznetsova, who often yelled out of frustration after mistakes.         
	The conditions are very difficult, especially since we were playing indoors for the past two months, Zvonareva said.         
	The top eight singles players are competing to win the season-ending tournament, a title regarded very prestigious.           (AP)

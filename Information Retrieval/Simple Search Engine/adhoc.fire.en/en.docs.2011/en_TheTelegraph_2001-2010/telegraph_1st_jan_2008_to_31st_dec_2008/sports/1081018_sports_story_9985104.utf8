                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tendulkar: Im relieved that this has finally happened
    - When you enjoy the game, you can deliver the goods           OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar after becoming the highest scorer in Tests on Friday. (AP)                                 
	Mohali: Sachin Tendulkar expressed relief on Friday after surpassing Brian Lara to become the highest run-getter in Test cricket. Addressing the media after the first days play, Tendulkar said he was happy that no one would again ask him when he would get to the record.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The achievement         
	Im very happy with the achievement. There have been a lot of discussions on the record. But I was more focused on the teams requirements. Whenever people met me, they would keep on asking one thing, when are you going to break the record. Im relieved this has finally happened and no one will ask me that question again. Im happy that I also scored 12,000 runs and all these contributions have come in a 19-year journey.         
	Fridays knock         
	Quite pleased with the knock today. When I walked in, we had lost three wickets. It was important we got into a good partnership and continued from there. That partnership (with Sourav) was important.         
	His first reaction after achieving the feat         
	When I looked up, obviously I had two thoughts in my mind. One was I thanked the Almighty and the second one, I thanked my father. Today I missed him. He would definitely be a proud man and I just thought of him.         
	The Mohali wicket         
	The wicket is playing nicely Its on the slower side... not much bounce and turn As the game progresses it will change.                   
	Missing his century         
	I was disappointed that I missed my century. After those crackers went off, we decided to focus on our game and continue batting for a long time. To play a reverse swing ball and playing a new ball is totally different. It took me a fraction longer to adjust and I paid the price for that.         
	His journey         
	I dont know how to describe my journey. It has been fantastic so far. I enjoyed it a lot. It is not only about success. There have been ups and downs through those various challenges and I have been able to overcome those obstacles. Success is a process and during that journey sometimes there are stones thrown at you You need to convert them into milestones. I could overcome those hurdles through the support of my family and well-wishers. Every one wants me to do well. Its a huge strength.         
	His sons reaction         
	I dont know how my son will react. He always tends to surprise me.         
	His next target         
	My next target would be to continue playing like this. I have enjoyed and am enjoying the game. I need to continue with that because I started as a 16-year old and there were no targets then. I just wanted to go and enjoy every moment. When you enjoy the game, you can deliver the goods. Not to think of too many things and complicate my game in the process.         
	Who will break his record         
	I think all records are meant to be broken. Lets see. Im quite pleased that it has come my way. I dont know what is going to happen in future. There might be another 16-year old, who wont be having any targets and who knows where he is going to go.         
	On the record coming against Australia         
	It is a coincidence that it has happened against Australia. I would have liked to get that record against any side. But it obviously makes it a special one since I have got it against Australia as they are the world No. 1.         
	The pressure he was going through         
	To be honest, I was not under any pressure for this record. I knew that I have to go out and play my game. It will come at some stage. There was no burden as such. Today I decided, just to watch the ball as closely as possible so that my focus would be on watching the ball.         
	If it was his proudest moment         
	It is one of the proudest moments. Every time we do well and we win, its a terrific feeling for me. I was very happy after the record but I knew at the same time that there was a big task that needed to be focused on.         
	If he is conscious of these records         
	As the career progresses, the sub-conscious mind starts thinking about it. You know that people start talking about the records. That is how you become aware of all these things. There have been occasions I told my teammates I dont know how many runs I need. A couple of teammates did not believe. I was willing to swear on anyone that I didnt know. That is when they believed.         
	The sparse crowd present at the stadium         
	I did not feel anything about the poor crowd attendance. Its about quality not quantity. I got a fantastic reception; it was a pleasing moment. I appreciated every applause which came my way.         
	If the record was his answer to his critics         
	I dont need to prove anything to anyone. I have been around for 19 years and I did not want to prove to anyone whether it was the first year of my cricket or tenth, 15th or 19th year. What I need is to contribute to whatever the teams requirements are and if I can do that, Im happy. Im not here to answer x, y and z writing something or saying something about me. Its not necessary that they are always correct. It is their opinion and I dont take all those opinions seriously.         
	Srikkanth was the captain during his debut and the chief selector during the record         
	Its a coincidence that he was there at both the times. The first time when I played for India, he was the captain and now the chairman. It is a wonderful coincidence.         
	His best knocks         
	I think the first hundred (against England) will always be an important one. It was a special one. We kept the series intact. Then the Australian tour immediately after in 1991-1992. It was extremely good for me. I had a good tour and scored a couple of hundreds, at Sydney and at Perth, on two different kinds of surfaces. It gave me immense confidence. I felt I could bat anywhere in the world and score runs. Those knocks were probably the turning point of my career.         
	World Cup missing from his cabinet         
	That is something I would like to have. We were close to it in 2003. It was so close yet so far. Im not looking that far ahead. I just want to go out and enjoy myself and my game and not think of any targets.         
	If he had a venue in mind to score these runs         
	I wanted to do it in front of the home crowd and Im quite happy that an Indian has achieved this record. It is not my record, its Indias record. Im happy it has been done on an Indian ground.         
	The best phase of his career         
	I relish every moment. Its not just about success. It is a circle of life. It comes as a package deal. There are days when I dont score runs. But every bit of experience has helped make me a better player.         
	On his future plans         
	I would like to continue. I am feeling good. What I feel is important. As long as Im enjoying, I will be playing. I dont think any x, y, z should ask me to stop.         
	Whom he wants to dedicate the record to         
	I dedicate this knock to my coach Ramakant Achrekar, my parents and my family, particularly my mother. My family always supported me and they were my strength.         
	Sourav being at the other end when he scored his 35th century         
	I was focusing on the match. In fact, he reminded me of my 35th century. Its wonderful to have him around, not only while batting in the middle, but generally we have shared some wonderful moments.         
	If he has Laras 400 in mind         
	I have not played for records. I cant be running after every record. I would be looking after what the team needs. If it comes my way, I will take it. If it doesnt come there will be no regrets.         
	On Greg Chappells comments         
	Again its only an opinion Sometimes it may be wrong.         
	Kumble and his birthday celebration         
	He is a true champion and the greatest bowler India has ever produced. He has a got a big and strong heart. There is a cake ready for him. My teammates will celebrate it.         
	Familys absence         
	It is not my familys style to go over the top. I know they will be extremely happy.         
	Fire crackers at the stadium         
	The duration was bit worrying. Eventually I figured out it was 11,954 crackers or something like that.         
	On how he slept last night         
	Honestly speaking, it was little difficult to sleep. Its not the pressure of the record Its the pressure of the Test match. It has always happened to me before a Test match.         
	On the match         
	We definitely need a big partnership tomorrow (Saturday), to make sure the foundation becomes more solid.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sir Alexs men must expect fireworks at Nou Camp
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sir Alexs men must expect fireworks at Nou Camp

	Manchester United require one special quality in the Catalan bull-ring that is Nou Camp on Wednesday evening: discipline. The world will tune in expecting the Beautiful Game, with Lionel Messi dribbles and Cristiano Ronaldo step-overs spicing every move, but the temperature could rise, particularly if Barcelona fans get on the backs of their under-performing team. Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes must retain composure as well as possession.         
	Barcelona are hardly notorious for the appliance of footballs darker arts, and in Messi they boast one of the most stylish performers on Planet Football, but they are a club in the grip of undoubted tensions, potentially sliding towards civil war. The occasion could get to players like Yaya Toure, Gabriel Milito and Rafael Marquez.         
	Everyone hopes for a fiesta of football, for Messi and Ronaldo to showcase their glittering gifts. It could be a classic encounter, one that will live in the memory of all privileged to be present and those watching from afar. But there could also be fireworks.         
	Rooney is so determined to succeed, so affronted by any injustice, perceived or otherwise, that he must guard against over-reacting if the evening does become fraught. At times, against Blackburn Rovers on Saturday, the England strikers fuse shortened and began burning. He must bite his tongue on Wednesday. Champions League officials will not tolerate dissent.         
	Sir Alex Ferguson is a canny coach, well-versed in the wiles of European foes, and will doubtless advise his players to be careful of any challenges that might tempt an opponent to go down and stay down, so triggering a booking and free-kick. Barcelona have enough adept ball-manipulators to punish United. Every tackle must be perfectly timed; every frustration kept in check.         
	Barcelona fans will appeal for everything, whistle derision at any challenge they deem overly physical. Few supports are as numerous, loyal and noisy as Barcelonas but they can turn fractious. Angered by their teams travails in La Liga, Barcelona supporters have been in near-mutinous mood, even threatening to invade the VIP area of the president, Joan Laporta, at the weekend.         
	Nou Camp could be a sulphurous place on Wednesday, a Rooney or Ronaldo goal away from mass handkerchief-waving hysteria. Barcelonas season rests on a good display and healthy first-leg scoreline. Frank Rijkaards side know how difficult it will be at Old Trafford next week, even with their leader Carles Puyol back from suspension.         
	One of Rijkaards predecessors, the great Johan Cruyff, has talked dismissively of the English long-ball style, but he clearly has not been watching United. His son, Jordi, would struggle to get even near Uniteds talented team now.         
	In Ronaldo, United have the Footballer of the Year. In Rooney, United have a striker made for this Camp Nou stage. In Carlos Tevez, United have a technically accomplished forward blessed with an exceptional work-rate. In Rio Ferdinand, United have a defender comfortable in possession who would stroll into Barcelonas back-four. Throw in individuals of the quality of Scholes, Patrice Evra, Nani and Anderson, and United are more the Total football made famous by Cruyff with Holland than the 21st-Century answer to the old Wimbledon, as Cruyff bizarrely believes.         
	Ferguson is building a fine side just as Rijkaards team look on the edge of a nervous breakdown. The tension in the Barcelona ranks is inescapable with the futures of Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto, Eidur Gudjohnsen, Ronaldinho and Deco all rousing heated debate.

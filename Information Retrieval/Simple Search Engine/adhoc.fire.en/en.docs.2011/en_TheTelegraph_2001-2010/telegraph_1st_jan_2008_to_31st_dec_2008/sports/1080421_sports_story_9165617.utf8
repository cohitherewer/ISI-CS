                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ricky: Ive always felt Sachin has a tighter technique than Lara
  - The Australian captain picks his top five batsmen         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                     
	Calcutta: Australias Ricky Ponting isnt just one of the exceptional captains, hes an outstanding batsman  testimony being 9,776 runs in Tests (34 hundreds, average of 58.53) and 11,026 runs in ODIs (26 hundreds, average of 43.40). The other day, speaking to The Telegraph, the 33-year-old Ricky listed his favourite batsmen.         
	Here goes:         
	The batsmen he idolised         
	Having grown up in Tasmania, it was David Boon... I also liked the way Kim Hughes batted...         
	His top five batsmen (alphabetically):         
	ADAM GILCHRIST: I think we won every time that Gilly got a hundred in an ODI... He made pretty similar contributions in Test cricket too... One sign of a great player is his ability to change a game in a short time... Gilly had that and, in Tests, could score at 4.5-5 an over... That quickly took the game away from the opposition... Indeed, Gilly revolutionised batting...         
	Test record: 5,570 runs (average of 47.60); ODI record: 9,619 runs (average of 35.89). Has retired.         
	MATTHEW HAYDEN: Youve only got to look at his record and see what hes done as an opening batsman... Not many can play for the number of years that hes done (15, at the international level) and have a Test average of 53-plus... His conversion rate for hundreds, for example, has been phenomenal... Matthew has such a presence and wants to straightaway dominate the bowling...         
	Test record: 8,242 runs (average of 53.51); ODI record: 6,133 runs (average of 43.80).         
	JUSTIN LANGER: Some may find his selection a bit surprising, but its a personal thing... I played a lot with him, had a number of incredible partnerships... On tours, especially, wed talk about cricket in general and batting in particular... Justin reinvented his game a bit, later in his career, but was always looking not to give anything away... An aggressive opener, he epitomised Australian cricket and was a great mate in the dressing room...         
	Test record: 7,696 runs (average of 45.27); ODI record: A Test specialist, Langer played only 8 ODIs  160 runs at an average of 32.00. Has retired.         
	BRIAN LARA: One of the two best batsmen that Ive played against... Probably the most destructive batsman on his day and certainly the best player of spin that Ive seen... He would manipulate fields... However, fielding in the slips, I always felt we had a good chance of getting him... We didnt always, but thats a different story...         
	Test record: 11,953 runs (average of 52.88); ODI record: 10,405 runs (average of 40.48). Has retired.         
	SACHIN TENDULKAR: In the same league as Lara, but Ive always felt that Sachin has a tighter technique... Because hes so solid, our bowlers have had to work hard to get him out... At different times, weve worked out different plans, but Sachin comes up with something to combat them... The sign of a truly class player...         
	Test record: 11,782 runs (average of 55.31); ODI record: 16,361 runs (average of 44.33).         
	Finally, his message for young batsmen         
	Keep working on the right things all the time... In fact, keep practising the things youre not good at... Thats critical to improving... Of course, youve got to be passionate about playing the game... Its passion which was my driving force... As a 16-year-old or so, I made sacrifices and anybody wanting to keep improving has to keep making sacrifices.

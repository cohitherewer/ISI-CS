  - DEODHAR TROPHY 
  -   Rahane, Nayar steer West to victory and a bonus point         A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Saurabh Tiwary hit 65                                 
	Calcutta/Hyderabad: East Zone had a poor day in office on Monday as they went down to West Zone who scored a six-wicket win with bonus point in the Deodhar Trophy.         
	At the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, Laxmi Ratan Shukla elected to bat after winning the toss. East Zone struggled and began cautiously to a disciplined bowling and fielding performance from the West Zone.         
	After a loss to Central Zone in their first encounter in which West were bundled out for a paltry 98, the defending champions dished out a much-improved performance.         
	West eventually bowled out East for 225 in 49.2 overs.         
	Having begun their campaign in the inter-zonal one-day tournament with an easy win over South on Friday, the loss to West was a rude shock for Laxmi amp; Co. The coach, Bharat Arun, admitted that they had a bad day in the field having dropped as many as four catches.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph before catching a flight to Bangalore, Arun said: We should have batted well A total of 250 would have been a good target.         
	But at the same time we did not field well. Even our bowling was not up to the mark. We dropped as many as four catches. Two of them  Wriddhiman Saha dropping Ajinkya Rahane behind the stumps and a caught and bowled chance of Abhishek Nayar by Shukla  could have made a difference.         
	Incidentally, Maharashtra batsman Rahane made a 72-ball 60 while Mumbai allrounder Nayar remained unbeaten on 49 to steer West home in 39.2 overs.         
	Arun, who was on his way to Bangalore for an NCA assignment, however added that they would come back strongly against Central at the same venue on Sunday. West head to Visakhapatnam to face North on Thursday.         
	For East, openers Sourav Ganguly and Arindam Das added 63 in 14 overs. Sourav hit five fours in his 30 before falling to a pull off Siddharth Trivedi. After Souravs departure, the top-order collapsed with the team reeling at 124 for four.         
	East were in need of a revival and it was Saurabh Tiwary who showed the way with his second half-century, adding 65 for the fifth wicket with Shukla.         
	The Jamshedpur batsman, fresh from his success in the U-19 World Cup, showed a lot of urgency in his innings off 58 balls, hitting four fours and two sixes.         
	However, they lost their way in the slog overs after Venugopal Rao struck twice to send back Shukla for 25 and then Wriddhiman for three with the scorecard reading 198 for six.         
	There was no late-innings surge from the lower order to boost the total as East settled for 225.         
	West skipper Wasim Jaffer began the chase with a thumping start. After losing his opening partner Yusuf Pathan (six) early, Jaffer upped the ante hitting 10 boundaries en route to his 43-ball 48. He looked set for more before Shib Paul Paul knocked off his middle stump.         
	Parthiv Patel and Rahane added 57 for the third wicket to help West coast towards the target. When Rahane fell for 60 in the 31st over, West were well ahead of the required rate and an unbeaten stand of 69 for the fifth wicket between Nayar and Venugopal Rao finished things off in a hurry. Nayar smashed seven fours and a six in his knock.

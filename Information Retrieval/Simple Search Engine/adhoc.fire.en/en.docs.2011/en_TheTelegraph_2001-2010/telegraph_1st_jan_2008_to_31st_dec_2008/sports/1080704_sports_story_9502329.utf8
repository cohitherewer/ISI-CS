                                                                                                                                                                                                     Coulthard to quit 
                      
	Silverstone: Former Grand Prix winner David Coulthard, at 37 the oldest driver in Formula One, announced on Thursday his retirement at the end of the season.         
	I would like to announce today (Thursday) my decision to retire from racing in Formula One at the end of this season, the Red Bull driver said in a statement issued before his home British Grand Prix.         
	I will remain actively involved in the sport as a consultant to Red Bull Racing focusing on testing and development of the cars.         
	I have an open mind as to whether or not I will compete again in the future, in some other form of motorsport, so I am definitely not hanging up my helmet, added the Scot, expected to be replaced by Sebastian Vettel.         
	Vettel is currently racing for Red Bulls Ferrari-powered Toro Rosso sister team.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav is my idol: Sankalan
                                                     Sourav is my idol: Sankalan
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sankalan Das at the MSCA ground on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Sankalan Dass mammoth innings of 351 in a single day in the CAB junior (110 points) match on Tuesday is a stepping stone for achieving his dream  to be another Sourav Ganguly  that he has been nurturing since he started playing.         
	He (Sourav) is my idol. I would like to emulate him and lead the country, the left-hander said on Wednesday.         
	The 16-year-old, also a right-arm leg-spinner, bagged three wickets and held three catches to bundle out 38-ward Krira--Unnayan Parishad for 99 runs in 34 overs and register a record 588-run win.         
	I am happy but there is no reason to celebrate like this. Its only a start and I want to carry on, said the class XI student of Uttarpara Government High School.         
	I can move to the next level only if I am consistent, he added.         
	Describing Sankalans innings as a clean one without a single false stroke, former national selector Sambaran Banerjee said: His shot selection was perfect. It was a great innings. A result of his dedication. I feel hes a great prospect.         
	Sankalans coach, Debabrata Bhattacharjee, wants him to concentrate on his game and work harder.         
	He must work on his on-side shots and backfoot defence. But hes a dedicated learner, Bhattacharjee said.         
	Its shame that at a time when the CAB is looking to host such mega events as the Indian Premier League (IPL), nobody in the state association could confirm whether Sankalans unbeaten 351 was actually a record or not.         
	As with lots of other things, the CAB needs to quickly get its act right where things such as records and statistics are concerned.

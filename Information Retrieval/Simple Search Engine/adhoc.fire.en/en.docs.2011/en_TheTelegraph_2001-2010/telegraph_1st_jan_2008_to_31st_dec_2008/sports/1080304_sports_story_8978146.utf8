	London: Holders AC Milan hope the return of three key players, including World Player of the Year Kaka, will give them the edge over Arsenal and a place in the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday. 
    
	Milan host the Premier League leaders at the San Siro with the first knockout round tie awaiting its first goal. Since the Champions League format was introduced in 1992-93, no tie in any knockout round has finished goalless after two legs. 
    
	In their search for a goal the European champions are set to recall Kaka, midfielder Andrea Pirlo and defender Alessandro Nesta after they missed the weekend Serie A draw with Lazio through injury. 
    
	Kaka is doing very well, Pirlo and Nesta will certainly be back in time for Tuesdays game, said Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti. 
    
	Milan have other injury worries, though, with midfielder Clarence Seedorf a doubt after suffering a leg muscle strain. 
    
	Milan have complained of fatigue after a punishing schedule since Christmas but Ancelotti said his side should put their worries aside. 
    
	I feel a lot of preoccupation around us, but Im convinced we are on top of the slope, he said. We will need personality, courage and desire, Ancelotti said. 
    
	We have had difficulties with the injuries. Nevertheless, I dont think physical strength is the most important aspect to winning in Europe at the moment and that is why I think we have a good chance. 
    
	Arsenal, held to a 1-1 draw by Aston Villa on Saturday which cut their lead to one point over Manchester United, could welcome back Dutch striker Robin van Persie to their squad after being plagued by injuries for much of the season. 
    
	Manager Arsene Wenger has been less pleased with their recent displays, with the serious injury to striker Eduardo da Silva during the 2-2 draw at Birmingham on February 23 having an effect. 
    
	We had a hangover from last week definitely. You could see that in the first half, Wenger said after the Villa game. Everyone goes through a bad spell. 
    
	Striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who hit the bar with a stoppage-time header in the first leg, has gone off the boil recently but is certain to start at the San Siro. 
    
	Wenger may decide to play him up front on his own given the nature of the tie and a lack of other options. 
    
	I believe we will play better on Tuesday. Against Villa ... we werent at our best and Tuesday will be a different game, Wenger said. (Agencies)

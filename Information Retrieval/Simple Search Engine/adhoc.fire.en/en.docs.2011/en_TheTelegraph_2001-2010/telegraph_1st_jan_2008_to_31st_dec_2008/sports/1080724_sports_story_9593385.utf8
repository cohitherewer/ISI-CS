            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The international hockey federation (FIH) is planning to introduce a new tournament  Asian Champions Trophy  to revive the popularity of the game in the continent.         
	According to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) secretary Randhir Singh, the FIH has already requested India to host the inaugural edition next year. They (FIH) have approached us and we are seriously thinking of holding the meet, the IOA chief said.         
	The tournament, Randhir said, will be in the lines of Champions Trophy. Only four Asian teams  India , Pakistan, South Korea and China  will play. The FIH is very keen to revive the interest of the game in Asia, he said.         
	Apart from allotting the 2010 World Cup, FIH has also asked India whether it would be in a position to host the 2012 edition of the Champions Trophy.         
	The IOA ad hoc committee, currently looking after hockey in the country, however, is yet to make up its mind on appointing the next national coach. A.K. Bansal, coach of the Indian team in the Azlan Shah meet, was a temporary appointment.         
	The ad hoc committee feels that the resignation of Ric Charlesworth wont be a hindrance towards the growth of the national team.         
	He asked for too much money, a fabulous amount. No committee can meet such a demand, said Randhir Singh, who is also a member of the ad hoc committee. We will appoint a new coach very soon.

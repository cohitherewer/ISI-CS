The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jhulan: Well have to be aggressive 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jhulan: Well have to be aggressive 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Captaincy came as a surprise for her, but the lanky Jhulan Goswami is not nervous at all. She is confident of a good show and is hopeful of coming out with flying colours in the so-called tough Australia series scheduled from October 28.         
	Yeah, obviously captaincy came as a surprise for me. I dreamt of leading the country from the day I started playing, but never thought of getting it now, Jhulan said.         
	According to the pacer, an aggressive approach against the Australians would help the Indians to win the series. India will play one Twenty20 International and five ODIs in Australia.         
	This will be their last series before the World Cup in Australia next year.         
	Playing in Australia is always tough And as a captain you will always feel the pressure. The expectations are always high But I am not worried. I love challenges and I know that an aggressive game plan will help our performance, Jhulan said.         
	The 24-year old Bengal pacer who toured Australia in 2006 feels that her earlier experience would come in handy for the forthcoming series. That will definitely help. I am sure the experience gained then will count this time, she said.         
	During their last tour, India lost the only Test match played at Adelaide and were blanked 0-3 in the three-match ODI series.         
	But Jhulan feels that the last tours result wont have any effect on the performance this time. I feel we are a far better side this time. There are seniors like Anjum Chopra, Mithali Raj, Rumeli Dhar and young talents like Priyanka Roy, Thirush Kamini and others. Its a nice blend of experience and youth. I am confident that if we stay positive we will surely be in a commanding position this time, she said.

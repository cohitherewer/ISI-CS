  - KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS OWNER IS CONFIDENT TEAM WILL BOUNCE BACK              LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan acknowledges the 
  Eden crowd on Tuesday                            Calcutta: Shah Rukh Khan hates losing, but he took the Kolkata Knight Riders rsquo; defeat on Tuesday night rather well. Later, after visiting the Mumbai Indians rsquo; dressing room and spending some ten minutes there, he spoke to The Telegraph.  The following are excerpts  First Knight Riders rsquo; defeat seen by him in person  (Grins) When we won the first two matches in a row, (coach) John Buchanan told everybody that lots of cricket remained to be played hellip; I rsquo;m a sportsman at heart and if we didn rsquo;t lose any match, then I rsquo;d feel odd hellip; Of course, it would rsquo;ve been nice to again win in Calcutta, but our batting became unstuck at the beginning hellip; I rsquo;m sure we rsquo;ll come back hard in the next match (on Thursday, in Jaipur).  The level of disappointment  There rsquo;s never a low for me hellip; I can never feel low hellip; There are times when my son (Aryan) runs a race but doesn rsquo;t come first hellip; I rsquo;ve myself lost races hellip; I rsquo;ve made flops but that doesn rsquo;t take anything away from life. It rsquo;s not that I like losing, though hellip; I don rsquo;t and my team doesn rsquo;t like losing either hellip; But, in sports, you win and lose hellip; You pray for a miracle hellip; Look for that one slice of luck coming your way hellip; But that doesn rsquo;t happen hellip; In fact, I believe that sports is the biggest leveller and sports teaches you to lead life hellip; There rsquo;ll be good days and bad days.   Reaction to defeats  I feel happy for whoever wins hellip; My parents taught me that I rsquo;ve got to be graceful in defeat and gracious in victory hellip; So, I do the same things when I lose, like going over to the opposition dressing room hellip; I wish them well and wish them from the bottom of my heart. I rsquo;m a winner because I rsquo;ve got this sportsman rsquo;s spirit hellip; If you rsquo;re mean and sad about your losses, then you can rsquo;t enjoy your victories that much hellip; It rsquo;s because of this attitude that I can, when we win, jump on the stadium rsquo;s roof and shout lsquo;we won rsquo; hellip;   On Ricky Ponting and Brendon McCullum leaving for home  I rsquo;ll miss them hellip; The boys will miss them hellip; The team will miss them hellip; They rsquo;ve been terrific in the dressing room and on the field hellip; (After a pause) At the end of each match, I rsquo;ve been showing the team a dance-step hellip; I showed two tonight as I wasn rsquo;t there in Chennai the other evening hellip; I don rsquo;t talk cricket with the boys hellip; That rsquo;s done by John and the others hellip; I only bring positivity.  Having flown thousands of miles to make it for Tuesday rsquo;s match  Yes, it was difficult yaar hellip; I was in London, then I went to Paris hellip; From there back to London and, then, Mumbai before making it here just in time (on a private aircraft) hellip; While it was difficult, I wouldn rsquo;t have missed coming to Calcutta for the world hellip; I rsquo;ll be off tomorrow (Wednesday) morning as I rsquo;ve got to shoot for my TV show (Kya Aap Paanchvi Paas Se Tez Hain?) hellip; Nothing stops me from going to all the Knight Riders rsquo; matches hellip; I do have shooting commitments which were finalised a year in advance but I could finish early and hop on to a private aircraft and land up in Jaipur or Mohali for the second half of the match hellip; I was in London when we played in Chennai and I had to go on the stage hellip; I remember becoming anxious and calling Juhi (Mehta, co-owner) hellip; I told her that I wanted to be with the team and not in London hellip; It rsquo;s not that I rsquo;m the luck factor or something hellip; The reality is that we rsquo;ve got a good team and this team will bounce back.   The organisational bit of the second match at home  Like I said after the first match, we rsquo;ll be improving with every game hellip; (Adds laughing) Hopefully, we rsquo;ll get everything right by the end of the IPL! I rsquo;m sure the spectators found it a nicer experience tonight, though the electronic scoreboard was too dim.  Finally, whether he brought traffic to a halt in Paris too the other day  (Laughs) Well, yes hellip; And, you may not believe it, but there was a group of French girls with a banner which read lsquo;Korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re rsquo; hellip; It was absolutely amazing.

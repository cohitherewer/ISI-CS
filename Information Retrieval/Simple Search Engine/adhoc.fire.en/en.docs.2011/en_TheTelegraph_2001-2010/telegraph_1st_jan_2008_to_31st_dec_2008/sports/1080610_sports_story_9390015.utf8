The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Podolski brace in German win
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Podolski brace in German win
                      
	Klagenfurt: Polish-born forward Lukas Podolski struck twice to give Germany a 2-0 win over Poland on Sunday, ending their 12-year wait for a victory at the European Championship finals.         
	Podolski tapped the ball into an empty net midway through the first half after Miroslav Klose, another Polish-born striker, burst through to set him up in the group B game.         
	Germany continued to threaten and made it 2-0 when Podolski volleyed home from 12 metres in the 72nd minute after the defence failed to clear.         
	Victory extended Germanys unbeaten record against Poland to 16 games and secured their first win in the tournament since the final of Euro 96.         
	Podolski was named Man-of-the-Match but it was of little interest to the two-goal marksman. That doesnt mean anything to me, he told a German television channel. It was important we played a good match on Sunday. We won 2-0. We did what we set out to accomplish.         
	Podolski said he chose not to celebrate his goals because of his Polish roots. I was born in Poland. Ive got a big family. Its a part of my heart, he said.

            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Apprentice B. Mahesh stole the limelight in stead of jockey C. Alford, who was expected to rule the seven-event race card on Wednesday, the penultimate day of the monsoon season. Mahesh scored a popular double for trainer Darius Byramji. Starting off with a runaway victory of Compton Star in the 2,000m Rising Bell Cup, the apprentice demonstrated a fine piece of judgement while guiding Romantic Scene to a long-neck victory in the main event, the 1,400m Predator Cup.          
	Alford, however, continues to head the championship table with a seven-point lead over his fellow rider, D.K. Ashish. The season concludes on Saturday.

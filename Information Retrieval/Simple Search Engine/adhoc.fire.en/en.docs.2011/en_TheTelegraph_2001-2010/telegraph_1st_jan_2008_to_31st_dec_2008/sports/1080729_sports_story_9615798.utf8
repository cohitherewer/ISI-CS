	Colombo: According to the Galle stadium curator, Indian batsmen should prepare themselves for yet another vicious turner.         
	Jayantha Waranaveera has promised to give the Lankan spin duo all the home advantage they need to wreck the visiting line-up in the second Test, too.         
	This will be a spinners track. Why should we not prepare the pitch for spinners when we have bowlers like Muralidharan and Mendis in our squad, he said. However, the curator insists that the track would assist the fast bowlers initially.         
	It will assist the seamers initially. From the third day, it will start spinning. If Sri Lanka bat first then India could face defeat, he predicted. (PTI)

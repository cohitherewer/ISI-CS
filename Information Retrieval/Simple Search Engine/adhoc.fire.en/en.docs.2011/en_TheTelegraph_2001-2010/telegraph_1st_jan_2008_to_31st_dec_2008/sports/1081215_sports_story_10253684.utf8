            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Yuki Bhambri rounded off a successful 2008 in style by winning the boys singles title in the Orange Bowl Championships in Key Biscane in the US on Sunday.         
	The 16-year-old Indian defeated Jarmere Jenkins of the US 6-1, 6-3 in the final of the hardcourt Grade A tournament, a level second only to the Grand Slams.         
	The victory will see the Delhi lad, currently fourth in world junior rankings, finish the year as No. 2.         
	Ramesh Krishnan and Leander Paes, who were both world junior No.1, are the only players in the recent history of Indian tennis to have ranked better than Yuki.         
	Sania Mirza, who won the girls doubles title of the Wimbledon junior championships in 2003, was ranked No. 1 in doubles that year.         
	It caps a fine season for Yuki, who won titles at the Osaka Mayors Cup in Japan and Asia-Oceania Championships in Indonesia in successive weeks in October-November.         
	Besides, he also reached two Grade 1 finals in March-April and led Indias challenge in the junior Davis Cup finals in Mexico, winning all his three singles matches. The Indian is also in doubles final with local lad Chase Buchanan.         
	Yuki and Chase edged out Shuichi Sekiguchi of Japan and Tsung-hua Yang of Chinese Taipei 4-6, 6-3, 10-8 in the semi-finals.         
	Earlier, Yuki overcame fourth seed Cedrik-Marcel Stebe of Germany 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 in the singles semi-finals on Saturday.         
	That was the only time in the tournament when Yuki lost a set.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kirstens faux pas
                                                                                                                                                                                           Kirstens faux pas
                      
	Gary Kirsten didnt do a Geoff Lawson, but he got it all wrong on Saturday evening.         
	The Team India coach did, however, apologise to the media.         
	Kirsten was to have addressed a media conference at the National Stadium at 5.00 pm. Instead of doing so, he started on the journey back to the hotel with the Mahendra Singh Dhonis.         
	The coach returned midway, after the local media co-ordinator was able to establish contact.         
	Apologising, Kirsten said: I went to the wrong place (second floor instead of the third) and on not finding anybody there, I left... Im sorry.         
	The media, which is constantly having to beat deadlines, lost around an hour because of the coachs faux pas.           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN KARACHI

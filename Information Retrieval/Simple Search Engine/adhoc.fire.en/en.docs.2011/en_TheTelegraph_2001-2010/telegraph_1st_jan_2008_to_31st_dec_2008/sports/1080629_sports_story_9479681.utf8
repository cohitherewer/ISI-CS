The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer: Our team has quite a few non-performers
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zaheer: Our team has quite a few non-performers
  - Former Pakistan captain lauds Indias system and its cricketers         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Zaheer Abbas                                 
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain and one of the most graceful batsmen of all time, Zaheer Abbas, is an angry man nowadays. Put off by the national teams performances and the functioning of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).         
	That came through during Zaheers one-on-one with The Telegraph at his villa in the rather quiet Khayaban-e-Muhafiz area on Saturday morning. Zaheer, incidentally, is a former selector and manager too.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Controversies never seem to end in Pakistan cricket. Why?         
	A Being a former cricketer, it hurts Its very embarrassing too There werent such controversies during our time The crux of the problem, I think, is that a non-cricket person is heading the PCB Mind you, I have nothing personal against Dr Nasim Ashraf, but the point is: Where has Pakistan cricket gone under him?         
	Specifically, whats wrong with Dr Ashraf and his team?         
	Look, he does have a couple of cricketers around him, but nobody is a big name Whats painful is that nobody is taking cricket seriously. They want to be in power, thats it The approach isnt professional and theyve reduced things to a joke. There was a time when India would compete against Pakistan, today things have changed with India competing against Australia, the No.1 team The system in India and its cricketers need to be lauded. (After a pause) Our standard used to be so good when Abdul Hafeez Kardar headed the PCB So many quality cricketers used to come through. Not now We need administrators with competence and those who have a vision. Having said that, I accept nobody carries a magic wand and even a cricketer at the helm wont be able to change things in a hurry A beginning, though, should be made.         
	Another former captain, Majid Khan, has called for a probe into the PCBs financial irregularities. Are you lending your voice to that call?         
	Im not that bothered about financial matters, I want accountability on the state of Pakistan cricket. Why are we not the No.1 team? Whats being done to take us there? Id like those answers.         
	Youve spoken of administrators, but what about the cricketers whore wearing the Pakistan colours?         
	I get your point. Sadly, our team has quite a few non-performers I cant understand the logic of persisting with the Shoaib Maliks and the Shahid Afridis I mean, over the past few years, what have they done to be regulars? Then, Malik is the captain         
	Malik appears to be the Establishments blue eyed boy         
	(Laughs) Thats because the PCB doesnt want a strong captain, somebody like Imran Khan or Maliks predecessor, Inzamam-ul Haq Inzy ran the show and when somebody is that strong, then he can hold the Establishment to ransom I guess it suits those in power to persist with Malik.         
	Are you satisfied with the way the PCB has handled Shoaib Akhtar?         
	No Banning him for five years (reduced to 18 months) was a bit too much To an extent, you should protect your players instead of telling the world that X or Y is an absolute villain. If you need to discipline somebody, one really simple way is to just not pick that cricketer. Drop him for good.         
	But hed even hit teammate Mohammed Asif last year         
	Yes, but how can you overlook the provocation factor?         
	Asif has himself been in controversies, the latest being that detention in Dubai         
	He should be knowing whats legal to carry and what isnt Hes such a simple person and a nice guy, I dont know how he gets into all this.         
	Domestic cricket, I assume, needs to be overhauled?         
	Nowadays, there are more tournaments and, so, more matches But the number of quality players coming through has declined The only one to do so in recent times has been Sohail Tanvir Obviously, changes are needed.         
	Is there general disillusionment? Have the youngsters given up on cricket as a career option?         
	Nahin Nahin         
	For the past year or so, youve had paid selectors. Is that working?         
	All Ill say is that the selectors havent been acting professionally Theyve been keeping faith in non-performers.         
	Your take on Geoff Lawson as coach?         
	I cant blame him, for hes handling seasoned players How much can he do? If I had anything to do with the PCB, Id get a coach from overseas to work with the U-16s and the U-18s From there, like the players, he could graduate to the seniors team.         
	Finally, whats the difference youve noticed in this Indian team vis-a-vis the ones to have toured in the past?         
	The level of confidence Also, Ive been impressed by your (ODI) captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni I like his calm manner Hes always quietly confident Your bowling isnt formidable, but the batting line-up is superb.

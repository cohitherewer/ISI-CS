	Calcutta: Qualifiers Oil India gave Mohun Bagan a run for their money before going down 1-2 in their first match in Group D of the 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Friday.         
	The wily Jose Ramirez Barreto once again made the difference, scoring both the goals and creating many more opportunities. Oil Indias Durga Boro caught the eye scoring a goal and troubling the Bagan defence every now and then.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa had the job of planning his strategy against an unknown team. The difficulty showed in the first half. Oil India are a young side and their football brisk.         
	That surprised Mohun Bagan and before they could realise, Durga was right in front of their goal, unleashing a right-footed volley. But Sangram Mukherjee, unlike his teammates, was alert and denied Oil India.         
	That happened in the fourth minute. The minnows were all over Bagan till the ninth when Barreto brought some relief to the supporters heading home Mohanrajs cross from the right. That was, in fact, Bagans first real chance of the match.         
	Not that anything changed after the goal. It only made the affair evenly matched.         
	The Bagan defence, which was being troubled by the fleet-footed Durga, conceded the equaliser in the 36th minute.         
	Only Habibur Rehman was present in defence when Durga got a lob from the midfield.         
	The failed off-side trap left Sangram wondering if he should come out of the goal.         
	In the end, he was neither here nor there as Durga chipped the ball over his head and into the goal.         
	The Bagan coach, in order to make his team move faster, introduced Ishfaq Ahmed and P.C. Lalawmpuiya for Lalkamal Bhowmick and Shylo Malsawmtluanga respectively, in the second half.         
	The fresh legs kept the Oil India defence busy and made them increasingly error prone, ultimately leading to Barretos second goal in the 56th minute.         
	An off-colour Bhaichung Bhutia tried one of his trademark bicycle volleys. Goalkeeper Prandip Dutta kept that out but Barreto picked up the rebound. His right-footer hit Jyotish Basumatarys hand before going in. The referee, instead of allowing the goal, awarded Bagan a penalty which Barreto converted.         
	Oil India refused to give up but the young men looked tired, and perhaps the fatigue was more mental than of the body.         
	Nobody expected them to win and they had overcome the odds with agility and determination. But the second goal, even for them, was too much to contend with.         
	Air India and Vasco, the other two teams in the group, would know that the way to put Bagan in a spot is to make them run.

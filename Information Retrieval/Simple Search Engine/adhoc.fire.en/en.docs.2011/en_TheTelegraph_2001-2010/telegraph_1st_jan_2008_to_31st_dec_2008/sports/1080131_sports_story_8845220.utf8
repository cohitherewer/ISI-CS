                                                    Well face a tough test in Chile

	Indian hockey is bracing up for a crucial time a little over one month from now. The six-nation qualifying tournament for the 2008 Olympics will be held in Santiago, Chile, from March 1 to 9, and only the winners will make the Beijing cut. 
    
	Joaquim Carvalhos team is currently preparing for the Chilean test through a five-match series against Belgium in Chennai. It was supposed to be a tri-series but Pakistan refused to come, citing their own preparation for the Olympics. 
    
	Although we have taken a 3-0 lead after the first four matches against Belgium, our performance has not been up to the mark. In the first match, we were 3-0 up at one point of time but finished 4-4. In the second, we won 5-0, thanks to man of the match Tushar Khandekars hattrick. But, in my opinion, goalkeeper Bharat Chhetri was the hero. 
    
	The defence had a harrowing time in negotiating the Belgian attack in the first half and had Chhetri not stood tall under the bar, we may have lost the match. All five goals came after the break, but the backline never looked comfortable and often was found wanting in playing as a unit. 
    
	Our defensive and midfield frailties came to the fore again in the third match which we eventually won 3-2. We played with three forwards but, unfortunately, they failed to earn a single penalty corner. 
    
	Belgium may have shocked Germany and qualified for the Olympics, but they are basically a mediocre side. Therefore the fact that we are struggling against them do not augur well. 
    
	The lack of cohesion among the different departments bothers me most. The strategy of playing three forwards is a good idea but the half-line has so far failed to generate the much-needed attacking thrust from behind. Defence is another area Joaquim should immediately attend to. Belgium have exposed the lack of communication among the defenders and there has been also the common mistake of needlessly conceding penalty corners. 
    
	Besides, we seem to be lacking a genuine penalty corner specialist. Ragunath is now being played as a forward but he is essentially a full-back. Hence, his success in the role of a PC specialist is doubtful. 
    
	All this has made me keep my fingers crossed as far as our qualification for the Olympics is concerned. I must say the promise which the team had shown in the last year, is suddenly not looking so rosy. 
    
	Of the six nations in the fray in Santiago, England remain our hurdle No. 1. If we keep conceding silly penalty corners, we may survive a Belgian challenge, but not the English one. The stakes will be much higher in Chile and we will not afford to lose one single match there through our defensive shortcomings. 
    
	Though we need cohesion everywhere, much of our success in Chile will depend on how the defence stands up to the challenge. 
    
	Back to the citys hockey scenario, we are finally in the process of getting an astroturf and it should be laid at the SAI Eastern Region. Im also hopeful that the next Beighton Cup will be played on the astroturf. However, for the moment, my focus is solely on our upcoming test in South America.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serbian test for the Russians
                                                Serbian test for the Russians
                      
	London: Still riding a wave of euphoria after their Australian Open success, Novak Djokovic and Nenad Zimonjic could turn out to be unwelcome guests in Moscow for Serbias Davis Cup tie against Russia.         
	Russia have proved to be the recent powerhouse in the mens team competition, winning the title in 2006 and finishing runners-up to the United States (US) last December, but their chances of making it past even the first round in 2008 look rather slim. Facing an in-form team spearheaded by newly crowned Australian Open mens champion Djokovic and mixed doubles winner Zimonjic, Russia will enter the hardcourt tie as underdogs even though they enjoy home advantage.         
	The US have barely had two months to savour their latest triumph, and 32nd in total, before having to fly back to Europe to begin their title defence in Austria.         
	Captain Patrick McEnroe has chosen to keep faith with a winning combination with doubles specialists Mike and Bob Bryan joining forces with Andy Roddick and James Blake. Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer have excused themselves from Spains long haul trip to Peru. Despite the absence of their top five players, the twice former champions should still manage to roll over a team making their world group debut.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Jagmohan Dalmiya at the CAB on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Howrah Union and Malda DSAs nomination papers for the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections failed to pass the scrutiny on Friday. The court-appointed observer Justice Santosh Kumar Phoujdar will meet again on Saturday to decide their fate. The elections are due on Tuesday.         
	The nomination papers of 118 clubs were cleared during scrutiny on Friday. The nomination of one club was cancelled. Incumbent president Prasun Mukherjee and challenger and former president Jagmohan Dalmiya were both present during the scrutiny.         
	Howrah Unions five-year contract with actor and Indian Cricket League (ICL) stakeholder Mithun Chakrabortys Royal Bengal Tigers (RBT) has put its secretary Indranath Dey, a vice-presidential candidate from the ruling group, in a spot.         
	Dey has all along defended his stance stating that it has nothing to do with cricket and deals with the clubs football activities. On Friday, he submitted a letter to the CAB stating his position.         
	Not many are, however, ready to buy that argument.         
	Rule 3 (F) of the CABs Memorandum of Rules and Regulations states that the association must follow the guidelines issued by its parent body. The BCCI, in a circular, had asked all its affiliates, including the CAB, to severe links with any association or person having any connection with the rebel ICL.         
	Dey has maintained that the agreement is with RBT and not ICL. But ICLs business head Himanshu Modys presence at the announcement of the deal has raised several questions. The media release on the occasion also quoted Dey as saying: We thank ICL for giving us a bigger platform.         
	Malda DSAs Subhasish Sarkars nomination form has allegedly not been signed by the district magistrate and no meeting was held to clear his candidature.         
	We had a discussion on Howrah Union and Sarkars nominations Well make some more submissions on Saturday, Dalmiya said.

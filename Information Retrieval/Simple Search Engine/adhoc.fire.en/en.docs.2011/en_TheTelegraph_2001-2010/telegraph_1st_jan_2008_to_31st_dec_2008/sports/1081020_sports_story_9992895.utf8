The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mishras dream debut poses dilemma for the selectors 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mishras dream debut poses dilemma for the selectors 
    - Buzz is that Kumble may quit at the end of series             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Anil Kumble                                 
	Chandigarh: Five-and-a-half years after his India debut, in a limited overs tournament in Dhaka, leggie Amit Mishra returned a memorable five-wicket haul (conceding 71 runs) in his maiden Test innings.         
	That was on Sunday.         
	Of course, had (regular captain) Anil Kumble been fit, Mishra wouldnt have played in neighbouring Mohali. In fact, he couldve been on the sidelines right through the series against Australia.         
	Having grabbed the opportunity with both hands, though, the seedha-sadha Haryanvi has presented the selectors with a dilemma. What, after all, would be the XI for the next Test (New Delhi) if Kumble is available?         
	Look, well cross that bridge once we get to it... Right now, Id just like to compliment Mishra... Im so happy for him and happy that this committees decision to call him up has been vindicated, the chief selector, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, told The Telegraph at the Taj.         
	A colleague of Srikkanth, who didnt wish to be identified while speaking exclusively, said: Kumbles the captain for the entire (four-Test) series and, if hes available, then hes the first-choice leg-spinner. That should be quite clear...         
	Mishra may have to wait for a regular berth till Kumble decides to retire... Hes not yet 26 and, so, has years ahead of him... Whats pleasing is that we have such a quality spinner and, now, dont have to be despondent...         
	Indeed, with young Piyush Chawla being inconsistent, the fear was that nobody would be able to step into Kumbles jumbo shoes. Not so today, but its still advisable not to go overboard.         
	The buzz, significantly, is that Kumble could call it a day at the end of the ongoing series. Not because hes lost the art of taking wickets, but because his body has been stretched.         
	Kumbles just turned 38 and has been struggling with his bowling shoulder.         
	Narendra Hirwani, a leggie who had 16 victims on his sensational Test debut and is now a selector, remarked: Mishra has been rewarded for hard work... Id sensed hed get a fiver and told him exactly that yesterday (Saturday)... Main uske liye bahut khush hoon...         
	As for Kumble, hes right up there with the greatest... Mishra will have to work harder to get close to the position Kumble is in. Bahut mehnat karni padegi, but he can do it.         
	Mishra himself steered clear of any controversy by saying selection mera kaam nahin hai when somebody at the media conference pointed out that hed landed Srikkanth and Co. in a dilemma.         
	I think Mishras biggest quality is a willingness to learn and work very hard... I had quite a few sessions with him at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), in the summer, and found him to be an eager learner... I didnt find flaws, but did suggest a few things related to alignments and the cocking of the wrist... Minor adjustments...         
	That Mishra had over 300 first-class wickets before his Test debut shows how experienced he is... He didnt show nerves in Mohali and has been treating the Test as just another first-class game... His success is great for Indian cricket, is how another one-time leg-spinner, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, put it.         
	Siva, best remembered for 12 wickets in the Mumbai Test against David Gowers England in 1984-85, was at the NCA as a spin consultant.         
	Incidentally, its not the first time that a stand-in player has complicated matters either for the selectors or a tour selection committee.         
	For example, on the 2003-04 trip to Pakistan, Yuvraj Singhs superb 112 in the second Test (Lahore) led to opener Aakash Chopras exclusion in the decider at Rawalpindi as, otherwise, there wouldve been no place for Sourav Ganguly.         
	The-then regular captain had missed the first two Tests (the opening one was in Multan) owing to an injury and Yuvraj had been standing in. After that hundred on a dicey Gaddafi wicket, however, there was no way that Yuvraj could be left out.         
	Eventually, Parthiv Patel got promoted to open with Virender Sehwag in the decider, which went in Indias favour.         
	Well, what awaits Mishra, who came out of the wilderness with a hattrick (4-0-17-5) for the Delhi DareDevils, against the Deccan Chargers, in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League?

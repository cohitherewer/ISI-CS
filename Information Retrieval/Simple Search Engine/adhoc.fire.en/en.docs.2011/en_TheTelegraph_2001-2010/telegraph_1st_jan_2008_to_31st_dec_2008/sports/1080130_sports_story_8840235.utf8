                                                   Uzbekistan feel India favourites on grass

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	New Delhi: After routing India 4-1 on hardcourts back home in Namangan last year, Uzbekistan are now confident of a victory on grasscourts too. 
    
	Uzbekistan skipper Denis Istomin, who arrived in the capital with other team members to play the Asia-Oceania Davis Cup tie against India here from February 8 to 10, felt the surface shouldnt be a problem for the visitors. 
    
	Sarvar Ikramov and Vaja Uzakov are the other two members who have arrived with Istomin. Farrukh Dustov is expected to join the squad in a few days. 
    
	India are always favourites on grasscourts but that wont be a problem as all of us are in good form, said Istomin, who recently stretched Lleyton Hewitt to four sets in the Australian Open. 
    
	We havent played much on grass except at the Wimbledon but we will work out something, said Istomin after the practice session. We are aware that previously in Jaipur India beat us quite easily on the grasscourts there. 
    
	Interestingly, the Uzbeks couldnt get a feel of grasscourts on Tuesday and had to practice on hardcourts at the Delhi Lawn Tennis Association (DLTA) complex. The grasscourts at the National Sports Club of India (NSCI) are still under-prepared and would only be available for practice from Friday. 
    
	Istomin knows that Leander Paes is unlikely to play the tie because of a ligament tear, but is not ready to take India lightly. The Indians are expected to assemble at the end of this week.

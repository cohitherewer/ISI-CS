	London: Liverpool ended Chelseas 86-game unbeaten run at Stamford Bridge on Sunday with a 1-0 victory and went three points clear at the top of the Premier League.         
	Midfielder Xabi Alonso scored in the 10th minute with a shot that was deflected into the net by Chelsea defender Jose Bosingwa.         
	Claudio Ranieris Chelsea side lost in Feb. 2004 to Arsenal, but the London club hadnt been beaten at home since then  a record that remained intact under Jose Mourinho and Avram Grant. For Liverpool this was an acid test of their credentials. The Reds had never won at Chelsea during Benitezs four-year reign  and had only been successful there once in 19 years  so Sundays victory turned out to be a major statement of intent.         
	The loss came two days after Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari reportedly suggested that his side could finish the season unbeaten.         
	The result was not expected, but we have to understand that Liverpool are a very good side and they didnt play better than us but shot one ball better than us and won, Scolari said. They played eight players defensively and give no space to work the ball.         
	But Chelsea rarely looked capable of denying Liverpool a confidence-boosting victory that bolsters hopes that manager Rafa Benitez can end Liverpools 19-year wait for its 19th league title in May.         
	Top of the league, psychologically that should give us a big lift, Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said. (It is) four years since they have been beaten. Its a great record. Obviously it couldnt go on forever.         
	It had to finish some time, were delighted that it was us.         
	Psychologically it should give us a big lift, Carragher said. Before today Id probably say Chelsea were as good as anyone in Europe with the way theyve been playing this season.         
	Alonso, who Benitez tried to offload in the summer, scored with huge assistance from Bosingwa.         
	Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech had been diving to his right to block Alonsos shot until Bosingwa diverted the ball away from Cech and into the net.         
	It was the first goal Chelsea has conceded in more than ten hours over seven league and cup matches.         
	While Liverpools solid defensive barrier, marshalled superbly by Carragher, prevented Chelsea from creating many threatening chances. Alonso could have doubled the lead in the 62nd minute with a free kick that struck the base of the goal post with Cech well beaten.         
	Unbeaten Liverpool move to 23 points, three ahead of Chelsea and Hull City. An injury time goal from Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor sealed a 2-0 win for his side over West Ham.         
	Adebayor came on as a late substitute at Upton Park and immediately made an impact. In the 75th minute, the Togo international fired a shot that appeared to be going wide until West Ham right-back Julien Faubert poked the ball past his own goalkeeper for an own goal.         
	Adebayor got his second in injury time, placing a right-footed shot into the goal from about 18 yards. (Agencies)

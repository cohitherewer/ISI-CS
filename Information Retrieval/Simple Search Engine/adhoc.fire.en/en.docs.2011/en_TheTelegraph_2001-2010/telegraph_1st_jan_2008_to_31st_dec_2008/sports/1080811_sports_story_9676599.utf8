                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sri Lanka in box seat
                      
	Colombo: India were desperately struggling to save the series-deciding third and final Test at 161 for five, just managing to wipe out the deficit in their second innings against Sri Lanka on the third day here on Sunday.         
	With half of their batsmen back in the pavilion, Indians managed only a 14-run lead, thanks to Sri Lankan bowlers who put the visitors in a bind in the final session.         
	Rahul Dravid was batting on 46 and V.V.S. Laxman was unbeaten on 17 after Virender Sehwag (34) and Gautam Gambhir (26) put on 62 runs for the opening wicket.         
	Sehwag, tearing apart the bowlers during his brief stay, cut a good length ball off pacer Dammika Prasad from outside the off stump into the waiting hands of Thilan Samaraweera at gully. His knock included seven hits to the boundary.         
	Gambhir was the next to go, clean bowled by Prasad. Gambhir went for the pull and got an inside edge to his stumps.

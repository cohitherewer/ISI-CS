The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rohan Bopanna was man of the tie

	India moved into the second round of the Davis Cup Asia-Oceania Group I, defeating Uzbekistan 3-2 at the R. K. Khanna Stadium in Delhi. It was a close encounter which swung Indias way because of two reasons. First, the playing surface was grass and second, the domination we usually enjoy in the doubles match of the tie. Victory in doubles gives India a sure one out of the five matches  a 20% winning edge. Teams who have learned their tennis on clay courts dread playing on Indian grass prepared for Davis Cup play.         
	The thick grass on the court, growing on an uneven surface, keeps the bounce low and unpredictable. This nullifies the higher consistency and accuracy of top calibre players and makes them vulnerable to the chip and charge tactics which our boys are told to employ. Worldwide, except for the very top nations, other countries have developed a fear of playing India at home on grass courts.         
	For India, Rohan Bopanna was the man of the tie. He destroyed Farrukh Dustov in the opening match. Dustov kept looking at the grass listlessly and shaking his head, complaining of the unpredictable bounce. Yet another drubbing in the doubles shattered Dustovs morale. On the third day, Dustov was swamped by a fresh eager-to-play Prakash Amritraj.         
	After a spat over his fitness with non-playing captain Leander Paes, Prakash produced sparkling tennis to defeat Dustov and win the final rubber in four sets. It was a creditable victory under great pressure, as the result of the tie hinged on the outcome of the match.         
	Prakash is a natural grass court player. He can serve and volley, moves smoothly to the net, and can hustle his opponents into errors. His weakness seems to be his forehand which he is inclined to chip back and not hit aggressively.         
	In modern tennis, most of the top players cover two thirds of the court with an attacking top-spin forehand on hard court and clay court surfaces. It may be difficult for Prakash to improve his ATP rankings with his current style of play.         
	Bopanna impressed me a lot. He has a powerful serve, a big forehand and a backhand which is inconsistent but brilliant in patches. He has the game of a top 100 player but somehow is unable to close out matches. Against Denis Istomin, he seemed home and dry, being two sets to love up with a break in the third, But, in sight of victory, he faltered. His forehand went astray and he seemed to be tiring. Bopanna, properly handled, can be the sheet anchor of our team, as he is also a very good doubles player.         
	Somdev Dev Varman showed potential. He has what most of our players lack  the ability to rally from the back court  which is the backbone of modern tennis. A tenacious competitor, Dev Varman will be a welcome addition to our Davis Cup team. There is enormous scope for improvement in his game. By putting on 5-7 kg of muscle, Dev Varman could add 5-10 kph on his serve, which would make a world of difference.         
	More depth on his ground shots and a put-away shot could take his game to much higher levels. His game is not suited to grass courts as he does not have a net attack, but on clay and carpet courts he could become our mainstay due to his consistency from the back court.         
	India now play against Japan in the second round from April 1113. Japan defeated the Philippines 5  0 in Manila, which is an indication that they are a tough team. Their players, Soeda and Suzuki are also higher ranked than ours, but the rankings will surely be reversed when they see the grass courts in India. If we beat Japan, we play the winner of the Australia-Thailand tie. The winner there will advance to the World Group play-offs.         
	The bickering in the team was most unfortunate. Statements and counter-statements in the press by the captain and team members built up tension and discord.         
	The cardinal rule in all teams should be that only the captain can talk to the Press. Being captain is difficult enough. But with a ten-time Grand Slam champion Mahesh Bhupathi dissenting, and a member of the team Prakash, under the protective shadow of a towering icon of Indian tennis, Vijay Amritraj, it becomes a near impossible job for the captain to assert himself.

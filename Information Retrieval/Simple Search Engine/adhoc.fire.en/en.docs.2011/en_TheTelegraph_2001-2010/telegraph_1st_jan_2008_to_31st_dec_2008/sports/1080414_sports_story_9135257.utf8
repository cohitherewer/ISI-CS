            A STAFF REPORTER            John Buchanan with son Michael at the Eden on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: John Buchanan had made it clear to the players that he meant business on the opening day of the Kolkata Knight Riders camp. On Sunday, at the end of three-and-a-half hours of strenuous training they were left drained in the intense heat and humidity.         
	In keeping with the fast pace of the Twenty20 format, the players were made to go through some tough fielding drills. The stress was more on physical conditioning and enhancing their speed and agility.         
	If fitness trainer Adrian le Roux and strength trainer Michael Buchanan kept a strict vigil on their workout regime, John was waiting behind the nets noting minute details of each individuals game. There were occasions when he walked up to a player for an impromptu tip.         
	Assistant coach Mathew Mott was at the other end of the ground, manning the bowling machines.         
	To cap it all, Buchanan got the players together for a half-hour classroom session at one corner of the ground in the end. It was down to the basics as the coach explained the finer points on the white board.         
	Knowing well that the performance of the Indian players will be of utmost importance in deciding the fate of the team, Buchanan spent a lot of time with the Laxmi Ratan Shuklas and the Ranadeb Boses. The Aakash Chopras and Murali Kartiks also needed special attention. Ajit Agarkar also joined the camp on Sunday.         
	The young guns of Bengal, Debabrata Das and Wriddhiman Saha, were also impressive and Le Roux made it clear. We have been around for only a couple of days. Its difficult to take a call but they have been really impressive. Their fielding has also been good They, however, still have to work on a few things, he said.         
	In fact, the former Team India trainer is happy with the general awareness surrounding fitness. Looking at the youngsters in the side one could see they have been in the gym before. They have been exposed to exercises at a very young age in their provinces. Its very good to see the fielding and agility of the players.         
	We were working in the gym this morning, and the younger guys had no problem. It simply shows they have done some work in the gym They were aware of the exercises and knew what would follow, Le Roux said.         
	He also spelt out the need for special training programmes. Twenty20 format is a lot quicker than the other forms of the game. It needs more explosive work on the field Not much functional work. So         
	Weve special plans We practised for two days in the afternoon and will have an evening session tomorrow Most of the players havent been exposed or been away from the subcontinent conditions for some time. The reason behind practising in the sun is to expose them to the conditions. Weve devised certain guidelines for certain players.         
	Le Roux believes his earlier experience in these conditions will be of much help. It was a good experience for me with Team India. I learned a lot... Then I have been here with the South African team. I will fall back on these experiences.

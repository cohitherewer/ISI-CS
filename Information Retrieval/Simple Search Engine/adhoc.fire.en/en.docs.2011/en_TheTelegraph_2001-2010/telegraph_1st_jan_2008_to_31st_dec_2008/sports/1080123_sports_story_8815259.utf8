      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: India Under-19 wicketkeeper-batsman Sreevats Goswami is aiming to be more consistent as he prepares for the World Cup in Kuala Lumpur next month. 
    
	The 18-year-old Liluah resident is the sole cricketer from the state in the squad. 
    
	Weve just returned from South Africa. Weve been playing together and the side is talented. We have the confidence to make the semi-final in the World Cup, Sreevats told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 
    
	Sreevats had scores of 97, 105, 12, 20 and 20 in the five one-dayers in South Africa. He didnt score in the only innings in the first Test, and in the second made 40. Besides he also affected 11 dismissals behind the stumps on the tour. 
    
	Sreevats received praise from South Africas assistant coach Henry Williams. He told me that I had the talent and that I should keep going in the right earnest. 
    
	Having started his career with Liluah CCC, Sreevats shifted to Ashok Malhotra CA a few years back. Ashok Sir called to congratulate after the World Cup selection and has asked to be more consistent, he said. Sreevats will be playing in the CAB League at High Court ground on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Euro laurel integrates Spain
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Euro laurel integrates Spain
            FIONA GOVAN in MADRID            Spain players celebrate their Euro 2008 win                           
	When the final whistle blew on Sunday night at Ernst Happel stadium in Vienna, it did not just confirm Spain as winners of Euro 2008; it also signalled an end to decades of disappointment for a national team.         
	While Spain boasts some of the most talented footballers in the world and arch-rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona regularly contest the Champions League, the national side has long been regarded as a perennial underachiever.         
	Spain has finally brought an end to their black footballing legend, stated one newspaper the morning after the victory, while others screamed At last.         
	The prolonged losing streak led many to suspect that the countrys regional divisions, illustrated by the rivalry between provincial clubs, undermined the sense of unity needed to achieve international glory.         
	The Catalans and the Basques, whose language and culture were so ruthlessly repressed under Franco, would, it was thought, never lend their support to a team that so obviously had its roots in Castilian supremacy.         
	But the jubilant crowds that surged through the streets of cities across the country from the moment Torres sealed Spains victory over Germany showed that the nation as a whole was ready to celebrate.         
	Of course, the greatest scenes of rejoicing were to be found in the capital, where hundreds of thousands of fans spilled into the streets and plazas were draped in the red and gold Spanish flag that for many still embodies the authoritarianism of Madrid.         
	But as the Madrilenos revelled in the long overdue football success, so too, did their counterparts in towns and cities from the Pyrenees to the Costas. Even in Barcelona, capital of the fiercely independent Catalan region, where the slogan Catalonia is not Spain is still chanted and the Spanish national flag remains a rare sight, the people were ready to party.         
	This was no doubt helped by the fact that six of the squad members hailed from the autonomous region, but it was also a sign that the occasion had transcended regional rivalries.         
	This was not a victory for Madrid or Barca, said Arsenals Catalan midfielder Cesc Fabregas. This was a victory for a country and for football.         
	The whole event has revealed not only a rejuvenated sense of nationhood, but also a growing self-esteem. The last and only time Spain won an international football competition was in 1964 under Franco.         
	Since his death in 1975, Spain has transformed itself from an isolated backwater spurned by the rest of Europe to a modern democracy.         
	And Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Prime Minister, was quick to champion the significance of the event.         
	I am the first Prime Minister of [Spanish] democracy that has experienced the winning of a title like this. My generation deserved to see such a triumph, said the 47-year-old premier whose government has, since coming to power in 2004, introduced sweeping reforms including the legalisation of same-sex marriage and the extension of womens rights.         
	He will be hoping that the nations euphoria and new found optimism will help cushion the effects of an economic slowdown.         
	And what Spain as a nation, still lacks becomes glaringly obvious whenever its sporting heroes win a place on the podium: the country has proved unable to agree on lyrics to accompany its national anthem.         
	The national team had no choice but to hum along to an 18th-century military march, because a competition to find words before the tournament failed to produce consensus.         
	In January, the winning entry was announced and then abruptly dropped after the verses that opened with Viva Espana were widely deemed to be too patriotic.         
	Its no coincidence that the Spanish national anthem doesnt have any words, said Josep Ramoneda, head of the Centre for Contemporary Culture in Barcelona.         
	Nationalism in Spain is tainted by Francos legacy and you cant wash that away overnight.         
	But perhaps he was underestimating the power of football.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

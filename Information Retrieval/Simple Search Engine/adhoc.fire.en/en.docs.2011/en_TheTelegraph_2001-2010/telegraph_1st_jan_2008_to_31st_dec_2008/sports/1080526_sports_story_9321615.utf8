The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal tied 30th
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal tied 30th
                      
	Woodmore (US): Arjun Atwal brought home his second successive card of 71 to jump to tied 30th after the penultimate round of the Melwood Prince Georges County Open .         
	The Orlando-based Indian began well and was two-under by the time he approached the ninth hole, which eventually cost him a shot.         
	His dramatic back nine got off to a birdie-double bogey-birdie start.         
	There was a huddle at the top with the quartet of David Mathis (66), Chad Ginn (72), Matt Weibring (71) and Jeff Klauk (73) sharing the pole position at nine-under 207.

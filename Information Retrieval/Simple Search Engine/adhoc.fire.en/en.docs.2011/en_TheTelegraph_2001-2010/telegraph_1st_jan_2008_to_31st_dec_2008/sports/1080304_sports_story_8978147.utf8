                                                   Barcelona cautious vs Celtic 

           
	Barcelona: FC Barcelona will try to guard against complacency when they host Celtic in the Champions Leagues second round on Tuesday. 
    
	The two-time winners only need a draw from the return leg at Nou Camp to progress to the quarter finals following their 3-2 victory in the first leg in Glasgow, two weeks ago. 
    
	We have to be really centred because its a really important match. Were in a good position but we have to avoid being too confident, Barcelona midfielder Edmilson said. 
    
	Barcelona will also want to atone for their 2-4 defeat at Atletico Madrid on Saturday, the teams first loss in 16 games in all competitions which struck a blow to their Spanish title hopes. 
    
	Coach Frank Rijkaard is expected to recall forward Lionel Messi, who scored two goals in Glasgow but started Saturdays match on the bench due to a minor injury. 
    
	Messis return would likely mean that either Ronaldinho, who scored a spectacular goal against Atletico, Thierry Henry or Samuel Eto is relegated to the substitutes bench. The teams so-called Fantastic Four has yet to be fielded in the same line-up. 
    
	Midfielders Deco and Yaya Toure should also be back. However, defensive midfielder Rafael Marquez, who hasnt played since being injured during the first leg, is doubtful. 
    
	Victory would maintain Barcelonas perfect home record in the Champions League this season.

                                                   Russia in semis

           
	Tel Aviv: Defending champions Russia took an unassailable 3-1 lead over Israel in their Fed Cup World Group first-round tie on Sunday after Maria Sharapova and Anna Chakvetadze won their singles rubbers. 
    
	Russia advance to a semi-final showdown on April 26-27 with the winners of the tie between the United States and Germany. Israel will play to avoid relegation from the World Group. 
    
	Russias world No. 7 Chakvetadze secured the tie after seeing off a brave challenge from Israels Tzipi Obziler to win 6-4, 6-2. 
    
	The Russian came back from 0-3 down in the first set to unsettle Chakvetadze if Obziler could stay with her.

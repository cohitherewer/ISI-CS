The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Trickett breaks 50m record
                                                   Trickett breaks 50m record
                      
	Sydney: Libby Trickett confirmed her status as the fastest woman on water when she broke the 50m freestyle world record on the final night of the Australian Olympic trials on Saturday.         
	Trickett (nee Lenton), stormed down one-lap of Sydneys International Aquatic Centre in 23.97 seconds to slice 0.12 off the previous record of 24.09 set five days ago by Marlene Veldhuis of The Netherlands at the European Championships in Eindhoven.         
	Trickett, who won five gold medals at last years World Championships, also broke the 100m freestyle world record on Thursday and won the 100m butterfly earlier in the week to qualify for six events in Beijing.         
	I never really thought I could go this quick before, the 23-year-old said. I have not been able to put together a good 50 before, but after the 100 I was just so excited for this race.         
	Cate Campbell, 15, finished second in 24.38 to book her second individual swim in China after finishing runner-up to Trickett in the 100 and boost Australias chances of winning the three womens relays.

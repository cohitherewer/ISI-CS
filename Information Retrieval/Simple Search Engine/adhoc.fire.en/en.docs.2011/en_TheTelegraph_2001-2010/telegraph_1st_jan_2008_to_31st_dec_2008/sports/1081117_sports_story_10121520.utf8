	Singapore: Indias Jeev Milkha Singh won a nail-biting Singapore Open on Sunday after Padraig Harrington and Ernie Els came agonisingly close to taking the $5 million Asian Tour event to a play-off.         
	Jeev, who virtually sealed the Asian Order of Merit title with the win, started the day five shots behind leader Chapchai Nirat of Thailand but three birdies on the front nine helped him to the top of the leaderboard at seven-under par.         
	Three-time Major winner Harrington looked certain to force a play-off after a stunning fairway wood gave him the chance of birdie at the last, but the Irishmans five-foot putt leaked across the face of the hole.         
	Jeev takes home a winners cheque for $792,500 and becomes the first player on the Asian Tour to win more than $1 million in a single season. The Indians earnings soared to more than $1.4 million with the Singapore victory.         
	Els moved within a shot of leader Jeev with a birdie at the 16th, but a poor tee-shot on 18 left him with too much to do and the South Africans birdie putt veered away from the cup at the last second.         
	Irishman Harrington was left cursing his luck after some bad breaks over the closing holes denied him the chance of capping a magnificent year with a victory in Singapore.         
	He spent the day duelling with Jeev but his final round 70 was good enough only for joint second with Els.         
	Jeev, No. 1 in Asia in 2006, would now lose the Order of Merit title to Mark Brown only if the New Zealander goes on to win all the next four Asian Tour titles.         
	Among others Indians in fray, Gaurav Ghei carded 76 to settle for tied 22nd with an aggregate of 287.         
	European Tour regular Shiv Kapur (289) brought home one-under 70, to finish 31st, one shot ahead of compatriot Jyoti Randhawa who went three-over 74.         
	Indian Masters winner S.S.P. Chowrasia aggregated 291 to finish tied 41st, while Digvijay Singh, despite his brilliant start in the tournament, went on to finish tied 58th at 10-over 294. (agencies)

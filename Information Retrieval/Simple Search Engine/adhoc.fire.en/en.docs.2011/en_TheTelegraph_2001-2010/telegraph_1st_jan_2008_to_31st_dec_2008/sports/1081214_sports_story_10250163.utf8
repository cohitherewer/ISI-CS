            A STAFF REPORTER            Sunil Chetri after the match at the Barasat Stadium on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Sunil Chetri regained his lost form to guide holders East Bengal to a 1-0 win over JCT in the 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium here Saturday. The red and gold brigade is thus almost assured of a semi-final berth.         
	In an earlier group C match, qualifiers New Delhi Heroes knocked out I-League leaders Sporting Clube de Goa by a similar margin.         
	With two wins, East Bengal climbed to the top of group C with six points, while JCT and New Delhi Heroes have three each.         
	Despite having beaten Sporting Clube de Goa quite comfortably on Thursday JCT were over cautious against East Bengal.         
	With the defensive JCT on the back foot East Bengal made constant forays into the opposition defence in search of a goal. Yakubu almost scored one in the 30th minute but a fine intercepting header by Julius Irabor Akpele saved JCT.         
	After the halftime deadlock, East Bengal intensified their attack in the second period and were rewarded with a goal for their efforts. Sunil and Yakubu combined brilliantly to produce the winner in the 47th minute.         
	Sunil picked up the ball in the mid-field and passed to Yakubu who played it back to the India striker. Sunil surged ahead and unleashed a powerful left-footer which beat JCT goalkeeper Karanjit Singh.         
	Earlier, qualifiers New Delhi Heroes stunned a listless Sporting Clube de Goa 1-0 to show the I-League leaders the door.         
	 Sporting Clube de Goa dished out arguably the most pathetic performance of the meet so far with their inept foreign striker Nathaniel Amos making a mess of the chances.         
	However, credit should be given to Chima Okories boys who cashed in on a set piece move which saw Stanley Cyprian set up Romeo Sukhlein for the winner in the 30th minute.         
	The move was created by Itau de Oliveira Rosa from the right flank. Stanely passed the ball to a surging Itau who deceived the Sporting Clube de Goa goalkeeper Rajat Guha and crossed it to Romeo who made no mistake in scoring.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gilchrist spoke loosely: Sachin
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gilchrist spoke loosely: Sachin
    - Icon hits back at former Australian wicketkeeper                   Sachin Tendulkar                           
	New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkar on Monday ticked off Adam Gilchrist for questioning his sportsman spirit and honesty, saying that such loose statements from a person who didnt know him well enough was shocking.         
	I was surprised. I didnt know how to react. What he alleged is something that I cant even think of in my wildest dreams. I love the game so much and those remarks came from someone who doesnt know me enough. I think he made loose statements, the batting maestro said.         
	Gilchrist has written in his upcoming autobiography that the Indian cricketer was hard to find for a handshake when India lose a Test. He cited the Sydney Test as an example.         
	Tendulkar said Gilchrist did call up to clear the air and he did not mince words in telling the former Australian wicketkeeper that he had forgotten the spirit in which the Indians took the Sydney defeat.         
	I am the kind of person who would leave things behind. So many times he mentioned that Harbhajan (Singh) and I are not traceable to shake hands. I reminded him that I was the first person to shake hands after the Sydney defeat. It was a tough game that we lost and it was difficult for us.         
	But none of us in the team would not shake hands. We have that sportsman spirit. We wont shy away from challenges, he told a television channel.         
	Gilchrist had also taken a swipe at Tendulkars honesty during the Harbhajan-Andrew Symonds race row trial, accusing him of giving different versions to the match referee and the ICC adjudicator but the Indian star said it was a closed chapter for him.         
	Thats his opinion but as far as I am concerned the chapter is closed, he said.         
	However, stung by a barrage of criticism, Gilchrist later denied calling Tendulkar a bad sport and a liar, claiming that he was misinterpreted by the media.         
	Gilchrist said earlier all was well between him and Tendulkar after he rang up the Indian batting maestro to explain how excerpts from his autobiography had been quoted out of context by newspapers. He said the conversation with Tendulkar has left him a relieved man.         
	There were headlines around the cricketing globe on Friday suggesting that I had accused Indian batting great Tendulkar of being a bad sport and also that he had lied when giving evidence in the Harbhajan racial vilification hearing earlier this year.         
	Neither of these accusations are true and I felt strongly enough on this to immediately ring Sachin once it was brought to my attention, to explain to him. I am pleased to say that at the conclusion of our chat, the same respect Sachin and I have always had for each other continues to exist, Gilchrist said.

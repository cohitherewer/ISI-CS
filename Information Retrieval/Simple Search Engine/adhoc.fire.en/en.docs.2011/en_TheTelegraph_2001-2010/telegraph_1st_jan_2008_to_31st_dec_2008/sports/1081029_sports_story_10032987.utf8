	Paris: Argentine Juan Martin del Potro put himself firmly on course for a Masters Cup berth when he thrashed Croatian Mario Ancic 6-0, 6-4 in the second round of the Paris Masters on Tuesday.         
	Ninth seed Del Potro, seventh in the ATP Race after claiming four ATP titles within five weeks this year, is one of the contenders for the three remaining spots in the season-ending tournament in Shanghai.         
	The 20-year-old faces a potentially treacherous third-round encounter with either German Nicolas Kiefer or compatriot David Nalbandian, who beat him in the semi-finals of the Swiss Indoors last weekend and still hopes to qualify for next months Masters Cup.         
	Del Potro caught his opponent snoozing in the first set and by the time Ancic had woken up, the Argentine was already one set up.         
	Ancic pulled himself together but dropped serve in a 10-minute third game and Del Potro held serve to seal the win on his first match point.         
	Local favourite Gael Monfils became the first player to reach the third round with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Argentine qualifier Juan Monaco.         
	The Frenchman, seeded 16th, will next meet Rafael Nadal if the Spaniard wins his second-round match against either Frances Florent Serra or Argentine Guillermo Canas.         
	I know my game suits Rafa, its up to me to find the weapons, said Monfils, one of the French crowds darlings since he reached the French Open last four this year. I already have an idea.         
	In first-round action, Swede Robin Soderling made light work of French wild card Josselin Ouanna with a 6-3, 6-4 win.         
	Soderling needed only one break in each set to down Ouanna in 58 minutes.         
	The world No. 18 will now meet second seed Roger Federer of Switzerland, who is looking to avoid a first year without a Masters Series title since 2003. (AGENCIES)

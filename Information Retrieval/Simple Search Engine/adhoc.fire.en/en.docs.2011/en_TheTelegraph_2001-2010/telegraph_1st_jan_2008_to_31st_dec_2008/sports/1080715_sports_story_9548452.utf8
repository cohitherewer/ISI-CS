                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal finishes tied 45th
                      
	Bridgeport: Arjun Atwal turned in his best card of the week  a four-under 68 to jump 20 spots on the leaderboard and finish tied 45th in the $1million Nation Wide Tour Players Cup.         
	Atwals improved final round performance saw him sign off with a total of one-under 287.         
	The 10th tee starter was on a roll with birdies on the 12th and 14th before a bogey-birdie-bogey finish to his first nine left him one-under at the turn.         
	In the front nine, Atwal twice scored a birdie-brace  on the second, third, eighth and ninth holes but a bogey sandwiched in between on the fourth denied him a higher finish on the leaderboard.         
	Meanwhile, American Rick Price (72) lifted the title after beating compatriot Chris Anderson (71) in a playoff. The duo had finished with totals of 15-under 273.           (PTI)

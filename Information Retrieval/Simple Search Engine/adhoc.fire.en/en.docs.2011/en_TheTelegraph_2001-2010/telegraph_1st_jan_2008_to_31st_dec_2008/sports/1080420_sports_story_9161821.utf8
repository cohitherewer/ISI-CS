                  Maria Sharapova, after her loss to Serena Williams on Saturday                     
	Charleston: Serena Williams reached the Family Circle Cup semi-finals on Friday by beating second seed Maria Sharapova 7-5, 4-6, 6-1 while Vera Zvonareva upset top seed Jelena Jankovic 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.         
	Sharapova, who won only nine of 35 points in a final set during which Williams made only one unforced error, lost to the American for the fifth time in seven career matches.         
	Williams improved to 5-2 overall against the Russian who lost for just the second time in 26 matches in 2008.         
	Williams, seeded fifth, blasted 11 aces and successfully landed 65 percent of her first serves during the two-hour, 30-minute affair to set up a clash with Frances unseeded Alize Cornet who upset 10th seed Agnes Szavay of Hungary.         
	In the third set I started to play the Serena game. Im not new to this, said the fifth seeded American who has now won four straight against Sharapova.         
	The 26-year-old former No. 1 is attempting to capture her third consecutive tournament at this clay court event, having won consecutive titles in Bangalore and Miami.         
	This is definitely a big win, but I still want to win the next round and win the tournament, said Williams.         
	Facing Williams for the first time on clay, Sharapova was in control early and served for the first set at 5-4.         
	Williams, however, reeled off the next three games  including two breaks  to steal the set.         
	I was lucky to hang in there during the first set, said Williams.         
	The Russian last week clinched her first clay court title, beating Dominika Cibulkova in the final on green clay at Amelia Island, while the American also won her last tournament, two weeks ago at Miami.         
	Sharapova was happy to take the positives from a tough loss the day before her 21st birthday.         
	Considering the success shes had on clay, she was obviously the favourite, she told reporters.         
	The Russian had a chance to win the first set 6-4 but failed to take it and although she won the second and battled to the end Williams finished much stronger to close out the match.         
	If I did take that (first) set point or if I had taken a couple of those important points, I would have won the second and the match would been over in two. So, you know, thats the way it goes and thats the beauty of tennis.         
	Zvonareva will face fellow Russian and fourth seeded Elena Dementieva in the other semi-final.         
	Dementieva eliminated seventh seeded Patty Schnyder of Switzerland 6-4, 6-4.           (AGENCIES)

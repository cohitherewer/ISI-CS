	Bangkok: Top-seeded Indo-Czech pair Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy stormed into the summit clash of the Thailand Open after inflicting a straight-set defeat on Fabrice Santoro and Jo-Wilfred Tsonga.         
	Paes-Dlouhy thrashed the unseeded French pair 6-4, 6-2 in the last-four match of the $576,000 hard court event. They will now take on the unseeded American duo of Scott Lipsky and David Martin, who beat French pair Julien Benneteau and Nicolas Mahut 6-3, 3-6, 10-7.         
	It took Paes-Dlouhy just 57 minutes to beat their rivals as they broke their opposition once in the first set and twice in the second to clinch the match. (PTI)

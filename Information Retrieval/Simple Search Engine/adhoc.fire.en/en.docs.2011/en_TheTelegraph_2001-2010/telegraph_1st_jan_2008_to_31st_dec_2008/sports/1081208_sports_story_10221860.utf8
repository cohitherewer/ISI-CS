                                                                                                                                                                                           Md. Sp. to miss foreign recruits
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting are eyeing full points when they face HAL in their second match of the ongoing 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Monday.         
	While coach Shabbir Ali is confident that his boys will leave no stone unturned to remain afloat in the tournament, opponents HAL on the other hand are looking to play safe.         
	Mohammedan Sporting are a good side. Though they lost against Churchill Brothers I feel they played well. We will stick to our plans but we need to be cautious, HAL coach M. Muralidharan said.         
	Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali will again miss his foreigners against HAL.         
	I have always said I have limited resources And there will be no foreigner tomorrow. But I am confident they will do fine, Shabbir said on Sunday.         
	Incidentally, Mohammedan Sporting lost 1-2 to Churchill Brothers in their first match while HAL were blanked by Mahindra United.         
	While Madhab Das will be in charge of defence, Shabbir will have Gautam Thakur, Vimal Pariyar upfront.         
	Goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar is almost certain to be included in the first XI.         
	Tharangachan Tungshang is not in good form. He appeared a bit shaky in last match and so we are thinking of including Naseem in the first XI tomorrow, a senior club official said on Sunday.         
	Meanwhile, a tough battle is on the cards in another match, when Churchill Brothers lock horns with Derek Pereiras Mahindra United. Both have won their opening ties and are on three points each.

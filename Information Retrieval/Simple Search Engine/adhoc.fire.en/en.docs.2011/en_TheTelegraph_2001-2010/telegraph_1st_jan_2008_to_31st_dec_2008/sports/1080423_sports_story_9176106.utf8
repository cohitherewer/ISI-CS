The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo: We could be Uniteds finest
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ronaldo: We could be Uniteds finest

	The qualities of Sir Alex Fergusons side have rarely been in doubt this season, but Cristiano Ronaldo believes that the current Manchester United squad could justifiably be viewed as the clubs best of all time if they succeed in securing the double of the Premier League and Champions League.         
	The next few days will go a long way towards determining whether or not the Portuguese wingers suggestion is premature, with Fergusons side facing Barcelona in Wednesday nights Champions League semi-final first leg before returning for Saturdays potential title decider with Chelsea.         
	A convincing result in the Nou Camp, followed by victory at Stamford Bridge, however, and Ronaldos claim, building on the managers assertion that his existing group of players is as strong as any he has worked with during his 21 years at Old Trafford, will gain credence.         
	I also think that this is the most talented team, but you can only confirm this at the end of the season, seeing what the team has won, Ronaldo said. There is a lot of talent, I think that we are going along the right path. Game after game we have shown that we have a fantastic team, with a lot of talent and magnificent players, but at the end of the season we will be able to provide a definite answer if this team is the best Manchester United side of all time. If we win the Champions League or the Premier League we will have a better idea.         
	Much of the focus of Wednesday nights meeting will be on the respective performances of Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the Argentine forward who returned to the Barcelona side this weekend after more than a month out, and whose displays have offered a rare glimmer of consistency during a frustrating season for the Catalan club.         
	Ferguson has singled out the threat of Messi, hinting at a tactical adjustment to deal with the South American, most likely an instruction to Owen Hargreaves to ensure adequate cover is available to smother the players forward bursts.         
	I have a team in mind that I want to use and it could be that one player is given an important role, said the United manager. Barcelona are not going through a great spell, but Messis been out for a few weeks and hes back and will be the main threat.         
	The absence of Thierry Henry from training on Monday  the former Arsenal forward had a fever and, at best, is expected to start on the bench  accentuated the importance of Messi, although Ferguson believes the absence of Carles Puyol, the club captain who is suspended, will be more telling. I think they will miss Puyol because he is a major influence, Ferguson said.         
	Ronaldo, though, distanced himself from any suggestion that Barcelona are a side in decline. At this stage there are no easy games, he said. They are all very important matches where the pressure is very high for both teams and you need the maximum concentration.         
	Anything can happen. Our objective is to win as quickly as possible. We will play to find the best result in the Nou Camp. My objective at this point is to win all the competitions that I am still playing in. The Premier League is a reward for the whole year but they are all very important. I am not obsessed with the best player award. What I want is to play well and to always win.         
	Wes Brown, the United defender, signed a contract extension that will keep him at the club until 2012, although Browns full-back partner, Patrice Evra, revealed he had yet to conclude negotiations on a new deal.         
	My agent and the club are speaking about the contract, the Frenchman said. They had the first meeting a long time ago and now I am just waiting. It is not a problem. I have one year left and I want to stay but the ball is in the clubs court.

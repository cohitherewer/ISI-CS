                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeev at tied 3rd position
                  Jeev Milkha Singh                     
	Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh carded a modest two-under 68 to slip down to tied third spot but being just one stroke off the pace, the Indian remained in contention for the title after the penultimate round of the Golf Nippon Series JT Cup here Saturday.         
	The seasoned Indian pro has a total of eight-under 202, just a stroke behind the leading duo of Prayad Marksaeng (63) and Toshinori Muto (66).         
	Starting off on a steady note, Jeev parred the first five holes before hitting a stunning eagle on the sixth, which was followed by a birdie on the very next hole.         
	But a bogey on the ninth meant that he made the turn two-under.         
	The Chandigarh-golfer played out a subdued back-nine and picked up a birdie against a bogey to finish two-under for the day.         
	Jeev shares the third spot with locals Taichi Teshima (65) and Ryo Ishikowa (66).         
	Thailands Marksaeng shot a seven-under 63 to grab a share of the lead with Japans Muto.         
	Prayad, who won last months Dunlop Phoenix, opened with three straight birdies and added four more at the Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club to finish tied at nine-under 201 with Muto, who shot a 66.         
	Japanese teenager Ryo Ishikawa offset a pair of bogeys with six birdies for a 66 and is a further stroke back along with Teshima and overnight leader Jeev.         
	Ishikawa last weekend became the youngest golfer on the Japanese tour to reach $1 million in single-year winnings and will be bidding for his second win on the Japanese tour in Sundays final round.         
	The Nippon Series is the last event of the season on the Japan Tour and features this years tournament winners and players who finished among the top 25 in the money rankings through last weeks Casio Open.         
	Jeev overcame the grief of losing his child and turned in an even-par round to jump into the lead here on Friday.         
	With his wife recuperating in a local hospital after delivering a stillborn baby, playing in the Nippon Series was the last thing on Jeevs mind.         
	The Indian managed to total six-under 134 on Friday.         
	Im not in the mindset to focus on the game, Jeev had said.         
	The Indian is now in the hunt for his second Japan Tour title of the year, following his triumph in the Nagashima Shigeo Invitational Sega Sammy Cup.         
	The in-form Jeev had signed off with a decent one-under 69 for a tied 11th finish in the $2.5 million Hong Kong Open last Sunday.           (AGENCIES)

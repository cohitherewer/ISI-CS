	Bilbao (Spain): Viswanathan Anands wait for his maiden win in the Bilbao Grand Slam Final chess tournament got prolonged again as he drew his fifth round game with Magnus Carlsen to be joint fourth in the ongoing Euro 4,00,000 prize money meet.         
	The lead positions in the category-22 meet remained unchanged as all fifth round games ended in draw and consequentially, Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria remained atop the tables in the event with three points for a win and one for a draw.         
	Round V results: V. Anand (Ind, 4) drew with Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 8); Teimour Radjabov (Aze, 4) drew with Levon Aronian (Arm, 6); Vassily Ivanchuk (Ukr, 4) drew with Veselin Topalov (Bul, 9).

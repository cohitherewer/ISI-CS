	Madrid: Barcelona tore apart Almeria 5-0 with another irresistible first-half display at the Nou Camp to go top of the Primera Liga on Saturday.         
	In their last home game, Atletico Madrid were hammered 6-1, with Barcelonas first five goals coming in the opening half hour.         
	This time round, Samuel Eto bagged a hattrick and goals from Thierry Henry and Daniel Alves gave them a crushing 5-0 half-time lead against a side reduced to 10 men after 30 minutes.         
	Pep Guardiolas team made it nine consecutive wins in all competitions and moved to the top of the standings, ahead of Valencia on goal difference, with 19 points from eight games.         
	Barcelona scored the opener after only five minutes when a poor header out of defence fell for Cameroon striker Eto to volley home.         
	Lionel Messi crossed low for Henry to tap in the second and Almeria were reeling when Andres Iniesta sent Xavi through the oppositions back four to square for Eto to score again.         
	Messi pulled the ball back from the touchline for Eto to complete his hattrick with a back-heel in the 24th minute, taking his tally for the season to nine.         
	It got worse for Almeria when frustration led their top scorer Alvaro Negredo to take out Rafael Marquez with a late tackle that saw him shown a straight red card, leaving his side down to 10 men for the last hour.         
	Brazil fullback Alves powered a 30m free kick low to the right of Diego Alves for the fifth goal before the break.         
	Almeria stay sixth with 11 points from eight games.         
	Earlier, struggling Osasuna were left still seeking their first win this season after losing 0-2 at home to Real Betis.         
	Turkey midfielder Mehmet Aurelio gave Betis the lead with a free kick that flew through the wall just after the interval, and Argentine striker Mariano Pavone scrambled home the second after home keeper Ricardo Lopez spilled a free kick at the end.Former Spain coach Jose Antonio Camacho took charge of Osasuna two weeks ago, replacing the sacked Jose Angel Ziganda, but has failed to inspire a change in fortunes so far with two consecutive defeats to his name.         
	Betis climbed to 12th on eight points from eight games with their second win. Osasuna are second bottom with four points from eight games.         
	In Serie A action, striker Amauri bagged his third goal in a week to give Juventus a 1-0 win over Torino in a hotly-contested Turin derby on Saturday.         
	The victory followed two league defeats on the bounce for Juventus and further eased the pressure on coach Claudio Ranieri after Tuesdays 2-1 Champions League win over Real Madrid.         
	Amauri, who scored the winner against Real having netted in the 1-2 defeat at Napoli last weekend, burst down the left channel early in the second period and his shot crept under Torinos stand-in goalkeeper Alex Calderoni.         
	The 28-year-old forward, signed from Palermo in the close season, has applied for an Italian passport and could soon force his way into Italy coach Marcello Lippis plans having never played for his native Brazil.

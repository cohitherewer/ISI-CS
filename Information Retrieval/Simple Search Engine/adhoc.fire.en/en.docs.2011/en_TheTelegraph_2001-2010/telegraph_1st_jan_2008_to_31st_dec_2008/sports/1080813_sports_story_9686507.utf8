The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Easy for Paes, Bhupathi
                                                                                                                                                                                             Easy for Paes, Bhupathi
    - Women Archers campaign ends; Sania still uncertain; Khade, Sejwal fall short           OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes                                 
	Beijing: The atmosphere was one of festivity as Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi took on the French pair of Gael Monfils and Gilles Simon in the mens doubles first round action and demolished them 6-3, 6-3 in less than an hour.         
	The seventh-seeded Indians now meet the Brazilian pair of Marcelo Melo and Andre Sa, who upstaged Czech duo Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek 5-7, 6-2, 8-6.         
	Despite their not having played as much as they would have liked to in the recent months, it was not evident in their game. If there is animosity between them, it never showed. Rather, the mood was one of camaraderie, of light-hearted banter.         
	After the first three games went with the serve, India broke France to go 3-1 up and maintained the lead with Bhupathi serving out the set.         
	The second round saw both pairs level at 3-3 when the Indians again broke Monfils and Simon to go 4-3 up and Paes held his serve to make it 5-3.         
	In the ninth game, Monfils knocked one wide while Simons return hit the net. Paes then sealed the set and match with a scorcher of a backhand return that wheezed past Monfils.         
	The handful of India supporters egged the duo on with loud cheers and slogans.         
	Contrary to what the scoreline suggests, said Paes after the match, it wasnt that easy. You should remember that it is one or two shots that make the difference. Every match at this level is tough.         
	While Im happy with the way we played, we need to raise our game in the next round.         
	Paes seemed slightly irked at a question on whether the duo had recreated their magic.         
	What re-found? We never lost it. Yes, the idea is to reproduce that magic everyday, during every match. And sure Abhinav Bindra has a role in charging us up today, concluded Paes with a smile.         
	Meanwhile, Sania Mirza and Sunitha Rao are set to lock horns with Svetlana Kuznetsova and Dinara Safina in the second round of womens doubles on Wednesday. The Indian duo got a walkover from their first-round partners Tatiana Golovin and Pauline Permentier.         
	However, a question mark still exists over Sanias fitness after her wrist injury forced her to concede her singles first round match against Eveta Benesova while trailing 1-6, 1-2.         
	Sanias taken a break today(Tuesday). Shell warm up in the morning tomorrow (Wednesday) and then take a decision, team coach Nandan Bal told The Telegraph.         
	Shell surely going to give it a try, he added.

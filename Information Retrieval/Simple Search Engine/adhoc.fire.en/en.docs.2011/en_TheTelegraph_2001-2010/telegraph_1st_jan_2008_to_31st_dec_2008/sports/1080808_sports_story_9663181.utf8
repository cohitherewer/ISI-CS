The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need to take positive approach: Mahela
                                                                                                                                                                                           Need to take positive approach: Mahela
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said his team definitely need to think about the good starts that India were getting and would try to maintain pressure on the top order.               
	Following are excerpts:         
	On the third Test         
	Its a good Test match. Weve played some really good cricket this series and everyones feeling each other out now. Its going to be an interesting one; everything to play for.         
	On the track         
	This is a pretty good wicket. Over the years its been a very sporting wicket. A good batting track over the first three days and then turn and bounce. It was a good chase (of 352 vs SA in 2006) and everyone contributed. We lost nine wickets getting there but it was a sporting wicket and we had to really dig deep in that. It was a historical win for us coming against a big score and a quality pace attack. We won on the fifth day just before lunch or something, and so the match went all the way.         
	If there will be changes in the team         
	Were definitely leaving out Kulasekera. We still havent made the choice between the two quicks weve got. Both of them have good pace but we havent made the final decision. We just saw the wicket. We will go back and have a chat with the selectors. That is the only change.         
	On the threat of losing a home series         
	That doesnt go through our heads. We played a really good Test at the SSC, we fought very well at Galle and were looking forward to this one.         
	Sehwags batting         
	Veeru batted really well. He took his chances at Galle and credit goes to him. India are getting some good starts and thats something we will definitely think about. If we can manage to get breakthroughs we can manage to keep the rest of their batsmen pretty quiet. If we keep that pressure on the top of the order we have a very good chance.         
	On Indias middle order handling Mendis         
	Ajantha has picked up 18 wickets in two Tests. Do you think they are picking him? Im glad that they are picking him and hes still picking up wickets! I think credit should go to our bowlers. We kept a lot of pressure on them. They had starts but we still managed to get those wickets.         
	We just need to adjust a few things that weve discussed from the last match, where we made a few mistakes in the bowling department. If we can do that and keep the pressure on the Indian batsmen, that is important.         
	On Ishant Sharmas bowling         
	We all knew hes a handful. Hes got pace and he gets a bit of bounce but I thought the way we handled him was different than at the SSC. There was the same kind of venom there but we played him well. I thought we played him very well in the first innings at Galle. We dont need to worry too much, just give concern to areas, and respect their bowlers, who are all top class. We have to be positive about our approach.

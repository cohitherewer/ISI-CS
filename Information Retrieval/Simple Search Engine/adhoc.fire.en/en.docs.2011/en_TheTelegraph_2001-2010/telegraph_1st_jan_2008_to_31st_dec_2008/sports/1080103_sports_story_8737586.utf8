                                                Hari jumps into lead
                      
	Reggio Emilia (Italy): Grandmaster P. Harikrishna got the better of David Navaras defence and tamed the Czech to leapfrog into the lead after Round IV of the 50th Reggio Emilia Chess Tournament on Wednesday.         
	After his Round I loss to Zoltan Almasi of Hungary, this was Harikrishnas second victory in the 10-player round robin event. The Indian now leads the table along with Konstantin Landa of Russia, Vugar Gashimov of Azerbaijan and Almasi with 2.5 points each.         
	Dutch GM Sergei Tiviakov came back strongly in the event, making good use of the clock against Michele Godena of Italy to jump to joint fourth spot along side Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland, Chinese Ni Hua and Mihail Marin of Romania.         
	In other Round IV games, Ni Hua held Viktor Korchnoi, Landa played out a draw with Almasi while Mihail Marin and Gashimov too signed truce.         
	Earlier on Tuesday, Harikrishna played out an easy draw in black with GM Ni Hua of China in Round III of this category-16 round robin meet.         
	The draw was crucial as it kept the Indian within striking distance of the three leaders on two points each.           (PTI)

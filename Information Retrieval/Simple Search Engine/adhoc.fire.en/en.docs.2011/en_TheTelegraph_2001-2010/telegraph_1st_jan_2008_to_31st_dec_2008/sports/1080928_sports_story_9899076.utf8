	London: Former England captain Michael Vaughan was dropped from the squad for the India tour due to his batting slump.         
	Michael has not been selected for the tour of India because his place in the Test squad cannot be justified based on recent form, national selector Geoff Miller said.         
	Our view is that it will be to Englands benefit if he takes a break from international cricket, he said.           (PTI)

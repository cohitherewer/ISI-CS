      HONKY DORY
              
	Mumbai: Celebrations by the derby winning owners started at the dais itself. A bottle of champagne appeared from nowhere. It was uncorked immediately and the contents sprinkled on hundreds of photo journalists crowding the stage. Its a huge occasion for us, said J.K. Rattonsey, the proud part-owner of the winner, Hotstepper. Hundreds of his relations, combined with trainer S.S. Shahs kins had come from all parts of the country and they were in jubilant mood. Uncle was very sanguine of Hotsteppers victory, said the Bangalore trainer, S.K. Habib Khan. No wonder, a contingent of nearly two dozen went led-in the horse at the race track. Photographers clicked them all. 
     
	I wanted one of the best jockey to ride, I didnt want a hard luck story after the race, said Shah. Asked about his reaction when Hotstepper got the measure of Sweeping Success in the last stride, I had closed my eyes at the final stride. I came to know my horses victory when friends started congratulating me, said Shah.
     
	Jockey Mick Kinane was, however, confident about the victory of Hotstepper in the last furlong of the race. I wasnt unduly worried about Sweeping Success offering a resolute resistance. I had saved my horses energy early in the race and never hustled it much till the final 400 metres. My effort worked and Im very happy about it, said the winning jockey.
     
	Incidentally, Hotstepper has been bred at the Kehelam Stud Farm which is, however, closed now.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The weakest Aussie side, says Yuvraj
                                                                                                                                                                                                     The weakest Aussie side, says Yuvraj
                      
	Hyderabad: Yuvraj Singh believes that with no quality spinner in the ranks, Ricky Ponting has arrived here with the weakest Australian squad in recent times even though he warns India against complacence in the forthcoming Test series against them.         
	Under Yuvraj, the Board Presidents XI dominated the four-day warm-up match against Australia with the visitors barely managing to escape follow-on.         
	Australias thin spin resources were also exposed in the match, which convinces Yuvraj that for a change, Australia would no longer start the series as the overwhelming favourites.         
	Obviously (this is the weakest side in recent past), Yuvraj said. You see, last time they had Shane Warne in the side but this time their spin attack is not good enough. In such a situation, the fast bowlers have a tough job at hand. I think they would start the series pretty even, Yuvraj said.         
	They have a good pace attack but you cannot say the same for their spin department. Its going to be hard work for them on the tracks here, he said. (PTI)

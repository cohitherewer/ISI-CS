The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A good year for me, says Raina
                                                                                                                                                                                                     A good year for me, says Raina
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: This is what the captains and the Man-of-the-Match had to say in the post-match presentation ceremony.               
	Shoaib Malik  I had cramps but am feeling much better now. Three hundred was a good total but when you lose your main bowler, its difficult. They batted brilliantly but it was hard to come back after losing Gul. I batted well today and Im in good form now. But its hard to feel good when you lose the game and moreover if you are the captain. We are still missing an off-spinner in the team. But the next round is still there. We are looking forward to do well.         
	Suresh Raina  This year has been very good for me I am enjoying my batting. I would like to thank my captain and senior players. I enjoyed batting with Virender Sehwag, who is a world-class player. Its mind-blowing to see him hit. He just told me to play my natural game and I did just that. It was pretty hot out there but I have worked on my fitness and enjoyed my fielding and batting.

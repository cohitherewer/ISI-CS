	Margao: East Bengal are in danger of being eliminated from the India finals of the Manchester United Premier Cup for under-15 boys even before the tournament gets underway at the Nehru Stadium on Wednesday. 
    
	Eight teams, including defending champions East Bengal, are vying for top honours that would guarantee them a spot in the South Asian competition in Singapore in August. 
    
	For the past two years , Calcutta teams have been qualifying for the World finals. Mohun Bagan were the first team to make the grade, followed by East Bengal last season. 
    
	On Tuesday, when eight participating teams assembled at Mapusa here, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) started the process of trying to eliminate the over-aged boys. Of the 35 boys who are suspected to be over-aged, eight are from East Bengal. 
    
	 All the boys would now undergo MRI tests, the results of which will only be known after AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi inaugurates the tournament on Wednesday. 
    
	East Bengal coach Swarup Das is naturally perturbed. My only question is that what was the federation doing when the same boys played the preliminaries in Chandigarh. No one questioned their eligibility and they were allowed to play. 
    
	There are at least three boys who played in the MUPC World Finals last year without any problems. They have valid passports. Still they have been sent for MRIs, Das said. 
    
	At this rate it might be difficult to hold the tournament, said a tournament official. We only hope that most of the boys come out clear in the MRI tests. 
    
	As per the rules of the tournament, if two or more players of a team are found to be over-aged, the team could be scratched. 
    
	So much so that the inaugural match between East Bengal and Mahindra United (three players sent for MRIs) has now been converted into an exhibition tie. 
    
	The inauguration is in the morning and it would be difficult to get the MRI results so early. So we have decided to make it an unofficial match, said an official.

	New Delhi: Mohun Bagan juniors started their campaign in the Danone Nations Cup for under-14 boys in Paris on a bright note and won three of their four matches on Friday.         
	The victories took them to the pre-quarter finals of the 40-nation tournament where they will cross swords with mighty Czech Republic.         
	All matches were of 30-minute duration.         
	According to club sources, Mohun Bagan, who qualified for the final rounds in Paris after winning the India leg of the tournament in New Delhi, were stretched to a tie-breaker before they could overcome Poland 4-3.         
	The match ended 1-1 at regulation time.         
	Anubrata Maity, who struck for Mohun Bagan inside stipulation time, also scored in the shoot out. Tarun Sarkar and Dibyendu Das were the other scorers.         
	Saikat Das was exceptional under the bar.         
	In the second match of the day, Maity and Subhrojit Das got a goal each to steer Mohun Bagan to a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia but could not match the skills of the Italians in the following encounter to go down 0-2.         
	However, Maity once again came good in the last match and struck the only goal in Mohun Bagans 1-0 victory over Spain.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Foreigner not on radar
                                                                                                                                                                                           Foreigner not on radar
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is still undecided on their foreign player for the forthcoming season. The last date for including a foreigner in a Ranji Trophy side is October 1.         
	According to sources, the association is yet to establish contact with any player and will seek consultant Mohinder Amarnaths views. The former allrounder has already made it clear that he is not very keen on including a foreigner.         
	I dont think we will have a foreigner this time. Time is running out and we havent even shortlisted players. Because of the cramped international schedule, our choice is limited to only Sri Lankan and English players There are very few options in the circumstances and we dont wish to have someone just for the sake of it, a top CAB official said.         
	The players, too, are not keen on a foreigner. It means blocking a slot which could have been utilised by one of our own players. Why not nurture our own talent and reap long term benefits said a senior member of the side.         
	 Sourav Ganguly and Ranadeb Bose, meanwhile, will leave for Chandigarh on Thursday to participate in the J.P. Atray Trophy. They will turn out for local side LIC and the CAB has given them the necessary clearance.

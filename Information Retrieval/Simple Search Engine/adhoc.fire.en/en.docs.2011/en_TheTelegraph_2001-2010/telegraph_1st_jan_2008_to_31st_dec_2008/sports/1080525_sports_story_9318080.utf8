	Margao: Indias preparations for the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Championship in Maldives and Sri Lanka next month got a boost after they thrashed Chinese-Taipei 3-0 in the first warm up friendly at Nehru Stadium on Saturday.         
	India, who were not given much autonomy to operate into the rival side in the first-half, scored all the three goals in the second session through N.P. Pradeep (61st) and Sunil Chhetri (77th and 89th).         
	India could have won by a bigger margin, had it not for custodian Kun-chi Lu.         
	The home team took the lead in the 61st minute when a move from the right by Surkumar Singh sent a cross into the box for Pradeep to head it into the far corner of the net.         
	The Indians stepped up the tempo and twice came close to increase the lead but the Chinese-Taipei goalkeeper did well to put the ball out of danger of Bhaichung and Climax Lawrence shots.         
	After these close saves, India augmented the lead in the 77th minute through a solo effort by Chhetri, who then rounded off the tally when he completed his brace, one minute from final whistle with a stiff grounder of a pass by substitute Sushil Kumar.

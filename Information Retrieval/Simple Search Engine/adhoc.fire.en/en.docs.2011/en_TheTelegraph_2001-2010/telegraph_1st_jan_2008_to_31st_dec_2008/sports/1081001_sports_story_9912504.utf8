The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Consistency the key, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Consistency the key, says Dhoni
                      
	Bangalore: Team India ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday cautioned his teammates against taking Australia lightly in the upcoming Test series, saying that even without stalwarts like Glenn McGrath and Adam Gilchrist, the world champions remain the best.         
	Its not about whether you have an experienced player or not. Its about guys who will go out in the middle, take up responsibility and do well, he said.         
	So, thats what you need out there. The team that will be victorious will be one that plays consistent cricket.         
	Of course, experience does count but Australia has quite a few talented players who have played well, he added.         
	Dhoni said the home side would do well to take one match at a time instead of rushing through with their plans for the series.         
	You cant really be at your best if you are too desperate to perform, the wicket-keeper batsman said when asked if the home team was looking to settle a few scores against Ricky Pontings side.         
	Its not about settling things, (and if) you get desperate, that can hamper your performance... We will take it match by match, he said.

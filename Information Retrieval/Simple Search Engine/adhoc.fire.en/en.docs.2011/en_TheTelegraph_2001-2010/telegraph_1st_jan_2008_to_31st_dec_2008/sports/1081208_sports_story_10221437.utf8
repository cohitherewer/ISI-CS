	Guwahati: Ashok Dinda continued to impress as Bengal outplayed Assam to record their third victory in a row and almost ensured their entry into the knockout stage of the Ranji Trophy Plate group.         
	The hosts were dismissed for 139 in their second innings with medium pacer Dinda hastening Assams exit from the competition, picking up three of the five wickets to fall on Sunday morning.         
	Bengal scored the required 19 runs within 20 minutes, with the loss of opener Anustup Majumdar.         
	It was a turner from Anand Katti which Anustup mistimed to be caught at mid-on by Jacob Martin. Bengal reached the target in 6.4 overs with opener Rohan Banerjee (12) and Arindam Ghosh (1) at the crease.         
	A third consecutive bonus point would have been the icing on the cake for Bengal. But the visitors were not complaining given the comprehensive nature of the victory at the NF Railway Maligaon Stadium here.         
	Bengal are now tied with Madhya Pradesh on 18 points with one match to go in the group stage.         
	After Iresh Saxena picked up the last recognised batsman in allrounder Swarupam Purkayastha, Dinda wreaked havoc in the Assam tail.         
	Purkayastha could add only two runs to his overnight 21 before he edged Iresh to Rohan Banerjee at silly point.         
	Dinda then added three more scalps to his overnight tally of two, to return with figures of five for 28.         
	First innings hero with the ball, Ranadeb Bose, had to be content with two for 31.         
	Iresh picked up two for 27 while spinner Ritam Kundu picked up one for 42.         
	Bengal play their next match against Vidarbha in Nagpur from Friday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stage set for royal battle
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Stage set for royal battle
                      
	Bangalore: The stage is set for an exiting weekend for Indian Premier League (IPL) fans, as Bangalore Royal Challengers face giant killers Rajasthan Royals in their fourth match at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.         
	Shane Warne-led Rajasthan Royals, who were considered as the weakest team after a nine-wicket loss to Delhi DareDevils in their opening match, stunned Kings XI Punjab and Deccan Chargers and would be keen to prove that the feat was no fluke.         
	They jumped to fourth place after Thursdays superb win over Deccan Chargers and are determined to keep at bay the Rahul Dravid and Co., just one step behind them at the fifth spot.         
	The Jaipur outfit appeared to have gelled well under their charismatic leader Warne and their morale is boosted with the inclusion of South Africa Graeme Smith.         
	Royal Challengers, with a loss and a win from their two matches so far, will be hoping to earn more points with Pakistani batsman Misbah-ul Haq joining the team to strengthen their middle-order.         
	Their top-order, however seems to be a matter of concern with skipper Dravid yet to come to terms with the quickest version of the game.         
	Meanwhile, Indias Test captain Anil Kumble, who missed the Bangalores first two IPL matches, is yet to recover completely from a groin strain and is unlikely to feature in the playing eleven.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Farokh: I know my responsibilities
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Farokh: I know my responsibilities
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Farokh Engineer                           
	Calcutta: For once, Farokh Engineer has himself been stumped. Expectedly, hes not amused.         
	The India wicketkeeper of yesteryears, a Match Referee in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), is amazed at the allegation that he wore the Rajasthan Royals colours during that teams explosive face-off against the Kolkata Knight Riders in Jaipur on Thursday.         
	The IPL has, for its part, said Farokh could be disciplined if his actions were deemed to be unethical.         
	I think Im a sensible person and would do nothing to breach neutrality I was in the Match Referees uniform throughout, Farokh told The Telegraph on Friday evening, sounding very cut up.         
	Speaking from Jaipur, Farokh added: Surely, I know my responsibilities and would do nothing to disappoint the IPL authorities whove given me this role The only time that I wasnt in the Match Referees uniform was during the Knight Riders first match at the Eden (April 20) and thats because my kit hadnt arrived.         
	Asked if hed hobnobbed with the Kings XI Punjab owners (Preity Zinta and Co.) in Mohali last week, as has also been alleged, Farokh clarified: Its not a question of hobnobbing A request came from the franchise owners that some people wanted to meet me and I obliged. Thats it         
	Sources in Jaipur have, by the way, pointed out that there was a post-match party at a nightclub, Back to Basics, and that Farokh couldve mingled with the Rajasthan Royals at what essentially was a social gathering.         
	Nothing wrong with that. In fact, if Farokh actually had to take sides, he would cheer the Knight Riders as owner Shah Rukh Khan idolised him when both were much younger.         
	Footnote: The Rajasthan Royals captain-cum-coach Shane Warne never had anything positive to say during John Buchanans years as the Australia coach but that didnt stop him from shaking hands with Buchanan (now with the Knight Riders) after the match. Greg Chappell and Sourav Ganguly too shook hands but thats probably because they had to. Knowing Sourav, though, he wouldve hated finishing a loser in front of Greg, who was around doing TV duty.

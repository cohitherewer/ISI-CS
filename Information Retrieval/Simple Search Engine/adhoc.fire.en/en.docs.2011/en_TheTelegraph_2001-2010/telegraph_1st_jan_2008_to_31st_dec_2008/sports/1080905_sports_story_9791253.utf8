The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sisters energise US Open
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sisters energise US Open
            Kurt Streeter            Serena Williams                           
	New York: This felt different, felt special, felt more like opening night at a Broadway show than a pro tennis match. As the Williams sisters Venus and Serena took the court for their US Open quarter final, inside the massive Centre Court stadium the air cracked with excitement and electric energy.         
	Everybodys energy is way up, said Alicia Luna, a fan from New York, standing with three of her girlfriends. The women gushed about the Williams duo and said that when they found out the sisters would be playing, it was a dead-bolt lock  there was not a chance Luna and her friends would ever miss this match. Not a chance.         
	You dont hear this kind of excitement for many on the mens side of the draw. Maybe for Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer now, after their Wimbledon final. You certainly never hear excitement like this for anyone on the womens tour. The Williams sisters have transcended their sport. They are not tennis players anymore, they are simply stars.         
	It made you wonder about how hard this must be. How it must feel  even after playing 17 times on tour, even after meeting at the Wimbledon final this summer  to toe the baseline in front of thousands, preparing to serve against someone you love, someone you wish well for. Your flesh and blood.         
	Signs of this internal conflict showed in the opening moments. There were double faults and missed returns and poor approach shots. There was little rhythm. They both tend to hit the ball flat, tennis parlance for not imparting much spin. Add nerves to the mix and tennis balls struck hard and flat often sail well past the target.         
	Once they found their range, however, the quality improved. Venus leaped in front early with a break. She served for the first set. Then her sister caught up. A tie-breaker came and this far into the match they were striking the ball beautifully.         
	The crowd loved this match. They treated it like a final. Because the sisters often have up-and-down results, they came to New York with Serena seeded fourth, her sister seventh. That meant there was no guarantee theyd be set apart, in different halves of the 128-player draw. As things turned out, they ended up bunched up close, too close, so close that their match Wednesday night was a quarter final. A quarter final that felt like a final.         
	Serena won the first-set tiebreaker. Then she found herself behind again. Suddenly, there were more winners than mistakes. The fans were kept rising, clapping, yelling. It was raucous. It felt like an event. It felt like Broadway and the bright lights.         
	Venus nudged ahead again in the second set. She had plenty of chances. Set points by the handful. Then her sister clawed her way back. The points tumbled forward. There were back-and-forth rallies and mad dash slices and hard sprinting gets. Tennis as it should be played, tennis as good as it gets. Finally, at 8-7 in the tie-breaker, Serena ahead, her big sister hit a forehand long.         
	The crowd roared. The match was over. Serena over Venus, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (7). This was the 10th evening of play here at the US Open, but the tournament felt like it had finally begun.

    - WORLD CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP REVIEW                 GM SPEAK
     Pravin Thipsay        
	The much-awaited World Chess Championship match between Viswanathan Anand of India and Vladimir Kramnik of Russia has finally come to an end. There had been a lot of excitement about the match in the world, for various reasons.         
	When Garri Kasparov suddenly announced his retirement in 2003 while still at the top, the chess world was confused. After all, he was the undisputed world No. 1 for as many as 18 years  from 1985 to 2003  though his challengers changed with time. There was a lot of curiosity as to who would be the next champion.         
	At this time, the Russians thought they were still the supreme in the game. The Hungarians thought it was their Peter Leko who would take Kasparovs place. The Bulgarians felt that it was a golden opportunity for Veselin Topalov to take over the regime while the Indians were quite certain that it would be Viswanathan Anand.         
	In 2003, Fide announced a new world championship cycle. To the utter disappointment of the chess world, Fide decided to drop the stronger players like Anand and Vassily Ivanchuk from the qualifying cycle. The phase of chaos then began, with Topalov emerging champion from the qualifying event.         
	The great unification match between CPA champion Vladimir Kramnik and the Challenger Topalov in 2006 turned out to be strange in many ways. There were serious allegations and mud slinging by the players.         
	Though the Russian won the match, the quality of the games was so poor that Kramnik was never really accepted as the world champion by the chess fraternity.                   Viswanathan Anand      
	The following year, Fide conducted an eight-player double round robin league tournament to decide the world champion. Anand, who was the highest rated player in the world then, won the tournament quite convincingly, in the presence of Kramnik, Topalov and Leko.         
	It is a tradition in the chess world that when a world champion loses his title, he has a right to challenge the new champion for a return match. The Fide recognise this right. Therefore, in late 2007, Fide decided to hold a match between the two.         
	On one side was the 2006 champion, Kramnik, a pupil of Kasparov. On the other, there was the Indian who is not only unanimously accepted as the greatest chess genius since Jose Raul Capablanca, but is also the player most feared, since Kasparov.         
	The decision to conduct a match between Anand and Kramnik was perhaps the only non controversial and sensible decision taken by Fide in the last several years.         
	The players began their preparations more than six months ago. They started hiring strong players for the purpose. Kramnik chose to have Leko, Sergey Rublevsky (Russia) and Fressinet (France) in his team. Anand invited Rustom Kasimdzhanov (Uzbekistan), Peter Nielsen (Denmark), Radoslav Wojtaszek (Poland) to join his team.         
	The last six months were a sort of nightmare for both Anand and Kramnik. They were obliged to play the tournaments they had agreed to play earlier but were unable to come out with the openings they had been studying. As a result, both played poorly and dropped to world No. 5 and 6, respectively, in the world ratings.         
	The match, which began in Bonn on 14 th October, began with two fighting draws, clearly showing that both meant business. Kramniks opening novelty in the second game looked like a real attempt to forge a breakthrough, though Anand defended accurately and even emerged with some advantage.         
	In the third game, Anand used his first weapon. He played the sharp meran variation of the slav defence and came up with a brilliant opening novelty to score the first victory.         
	The basic idea of the opening choice was to get an imbalanced position, unsuitable to Kramniks style.         
	 Kramnik is basically a positional player with a distinct liking for closed and safe positions. In the third game, he was like a fish out of the water. The defending champion scored his first full point on the third day.         
	On the fourth day Anand played it safe. He changed his opening choice, obtained some advantage but did not press hard. The game ended in a dull draw.         
	The crucial and deciding day of the match was the fifth one. On this day, Kramnik lost the psychological battle.         
	In such an important match, it is normal for players to have two or three sets of openings. If something goes wrong with one, players opt for other options. However, on the fifth day, Kramniks ego prevailed over his wisdom when he decided to repeat the position from the third game.         
	Kramniks unwise decision to repeat the opening led to another loss for him.         
	The next game was just a farce. Kramnik was so shaken by his fifth game loss, that he played like a club level player on the sixth day and was easily defeated by the Indian.         
	Halfway through the match, the matter had already been decided. The champion was sitting pretty with 4.5 points, just two points away from the magic figure of 6.5.         
	Kramnik somewhat recovered in the second half. He played the positions suitable to him. Yet he was unable to crack the Indian in next three games.         
	At this stage, Anand made his only mistake in the match. Needing only half a point from three games, he played his worst game in the last ten years on the tenth day. Kramnik tamed the Indian in just 29 moves.         
	The champion, however, recovered immediately and clinched the title by making a safe draw in the eleventh game.         
	The 12-game match actually ended in 11 games itself, indicating that the champion is head and shoulders above the rest of the world.         
	The chess world is delighted to have a worthy successor to all time greats like Bobby Fischer, Anatoly Karpov and Kasparov. For Indians, it is indeed a golden moment.         
	Let us hope that Vishy remains at the top as long as Kasparov had been there!

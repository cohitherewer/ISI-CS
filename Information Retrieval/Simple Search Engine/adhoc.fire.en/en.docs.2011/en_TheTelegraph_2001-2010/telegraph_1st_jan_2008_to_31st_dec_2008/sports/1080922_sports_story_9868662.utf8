The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Referee Sankar steps into a new role
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Referee Sankar steps into a new role
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Refereeing is a regular cause of dispute in Indian football with clubs regularly bickering over disputed calls following the outcome of their matches.         
	Komaleeswaran Sankar, Indias only referee to supervise in the final rounds of the World Cup (2002 Japan-Korea), sees this as an unhealthy trend and has a solution to this problem.         
	Considered an icon of Indian refereeing, Sankar has decided to launch Indias first ever consultancy company for refereeing that will help everyone, including club officials, players, coaches and referees to understand the finer points of the game.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from Chennai, Sankar, who has just retired from active refereeing, said: This is a unique idea in Indian football, but not in the west. English Premier League teams regularly hire the services of consultancies for players counselling.         
	Three years back, the Greek football league decided to hire one such company to evaluate its oft-maligned referees and stop clubs from complaining over every bad call.         
	Sankar, whose company will be known as SAN Consultancy, will offer services to clubs willing to go to the root cause of the problems between referees and the players.         
	The consultancy package will offer advices and practical demonstrations about how a player should behave on the field, what all he should do to avoid yellow and red cards and other aspects of the referee-footballer relationship.         
	It is the lack of communication that creates most of the problems. Our aim is to close the gap, Sankar said.         
	Active referees can also avail the services to know about technical, physical and mental aspects of refereeing.

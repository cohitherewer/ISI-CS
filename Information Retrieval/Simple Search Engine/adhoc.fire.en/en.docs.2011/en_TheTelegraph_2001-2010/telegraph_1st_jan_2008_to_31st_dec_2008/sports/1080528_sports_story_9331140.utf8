	PCB ire  
	 Karachi: Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson may face a few hard questions from the cricket board top bosses after talking on some contentious issues in an interview to a local radio in Sydney. Lawson admitted in the interview that there were differences between him and chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed. According to sources, neither PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf nor governing body members were pleased with the development.         
	Super Tanvir         
	 Karachi: The success of paceman Sohail Tanvir in the IPL has set off a debate whether the youngster has it in him to follow the footsteps of Pakistan great Wasim Akram. Tanvir has bagged the highest number of wickets (21) so far. He has a unique bowling action which is a big help for him. Plus, like every good pace bowler, he has pace and swing, former captain Rashid Latif said. But Akram believes it is too early to have high hopes from Tanvir.         
	Shoaib test         
	 Karachi: Though Shoaib Akhtar is not among the contracted players of the PCB, the temperamental pacer has been told to appear in a dope test along with national team members. While there is nothing extraordinary with the contracted players being put through a dope test, the decision to ask Shoaib to undergo it has created a stir.  
	Bangla Squad  
	 Dhaka: Bangladesh named uncapped pace bowler Dollar Mahmud on Tuesday in a 14-man squad for next months tri-series with India and Pakistan.

	England in WI         
	 London: England will play four Tests, five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 International on their tour of the West Indies next year.

                                                     Dhoni: Senior batsmen can contribute more
            A CORRESPONDENT            Dhoni                           
	Sydney: Mahendra Singh Dhoni was on Sunday unsparing in his criticism of the top order batsmen saying they have been falling cheaply. The Team India captain said he was open to shuffling the order, if needed.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The teams performance         
	The bowling effort was good. We are talking about the positives of the game. Without any significant partnerships among the top batsmen we managed to get close to 300 runs.         
	The batting         
	The senior batsmen can contribute more... Specially if you see the matches we have played till now. Gautam is one of the batsmen whos been consistent. Rohit has done well in patches and Ive scored a few runs. If the first five batsmen can contribute and put up significant partnerships, then the lower order  me coming at five or six and Robin Uthappa after me  can really go after the bowlers. Get some runs for the team... But its very important to get the initial partnerships going.         
	The Australian team managements complaint about Dhonis wicketkeeping gloves         
	Its up to the Match Referee. Ive been using it for quite some time. Its exactly the replica of the one that I was using in the Test series. Thats all I know about it          
	The senior batsmen         
	If Viru (Virender Sehwag), Sachin (Tendulkar) and Yuvraj (Singh) do well, it gets easier for the batsmen to follow. But it hasnt been the story till now. Its not that theyll not score... We have a very important game against Sri Lanka and would like to win and get into the finals rather than wait for the Sri Lanka-Australia game.         
	The team composition         
	A couple of press conferences back you wanted me to play with four bowlers and an extra batsmen. Now we are doing the same. But the part-timer bowlers  Yuvraj bowled close to seven or eight overs, Viru bowled five or six overs  took up the responsibility and bowled well. I was quite happy with the bowlers performance overall. If you see the scorecard, Im happy with it but the top-order batsmen can score.         
	Sehwag and Sachin         
	They are getting out to good balls. You cannot really do much about it. Its not like they are getting out to some rash shots or they are not taking up that responsibility. At the international level youll get out to good deliveries and have got to accept it and go by it. Its very important to go in with the right approach. Everything is not in your control. The only thing you can do is give your hundred per cent. I think thats what they are doing and hopefully in the coming matches theyll come up with a big score.         
	The batting order         
	We have a few options. Robin Uthappa is an opener but if you see Gautam, the way he has batted at No 3. I dont really want him to open the innings. The other option is make Robin open with Sachin. All these kind of shuffling may go on, but it depends on the kind of wicket well get over there. It depends on the number of bowlers were going in with. Theres lots of speculation but Im open to it. If needed for the team, we can change the openers also.         
	His batting style         
	At times its difficult to decide  be the original Dhoni or play according to the situation. If you try to be aggressive, there would be a good chance of ending up at 150 or 180 with the whole side out. Thats why you choose to have a partnership with Gautam so that the lower order batsmen can come and contribute. That was one of the choices I made and was happy with it.

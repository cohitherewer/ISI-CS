	Calcutta: The Chennai Super Kings squad, sans Joginder Sharma, arrived in the city on Thursday. They face Kolkata Knight Riders in a return-leg IPL match on Sunday.         
	While captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni checked in later in the evening, the team members and the support staff arrived in the afternoon itself.         
	Upset with the nine-wicket thrashing at the hands of Mumbai Indians on Wednesday, the Chennai boys remained indoors and refused to talk.         
	All the members have gone into a shell after their loss yesterday (Wednesday). If they had won, they would have pleased to interact, said a team source, adding that they will go for practice (at the Eden) on Friday afternoon.         
	Having played 10 matches, Chennai are on the third spot with 12 points. Knight Riders are close behind with 10 points from nine matches. A win against Mumbai Indians on Friday, however, may see them upstage the Chennai side.         
	Meanwhile, details of Joginder Sharmas arrival will be known on Friday. Now a proud father, the Haryana allrounder flew to his hometown (Rohtak) to be with his family.         
	Although my son was born on Wednesday, I had to stay back because of the match (against Mumbai Indians). Im not sure when Im joining the team. However, Im keen to play against Kolkata (Knight Riders), the 24-year-old told The Telegraph from his Rohtak residence.         
	My wife and son both are fine This is our first child Im excited. At the moment, I want to be with my wife. Ill let the team members know about my exact status tomorrow (Friday), an elated Sharma added.

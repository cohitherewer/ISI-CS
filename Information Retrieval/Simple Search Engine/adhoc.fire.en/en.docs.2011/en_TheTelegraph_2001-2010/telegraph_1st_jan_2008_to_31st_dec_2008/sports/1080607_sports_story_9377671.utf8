The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asifs case is 50-50: PCB official
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Asifs case is 50-50: PCB official
                      
	Karachi: Despite testing negative for a banned drug, Pakistan pacer Mohammed Asif has only 50-50 chance of escaping punishment from the police in Dubai, according to a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official.         
	A local newspaper quoted a PCB official as saying that though Asif had tested negative, he has only 50 per cent chance of avoiding conviction after he was found carrying a small amount of opium.         
	After having taken a thorough look at his (Asifs) situation, I believe he has a 50-50 chance of avoiding any punishment, the official was quoted as saying.         
	Asif, who was caught with an illegal substance in his wallet on Sunday in Dubai on way to Lahore from India, is due to be produced in a court on coming Sunday, although no changes have been framed against him as yet.         
	The PCB is trying to get a clean chit for the player, who has a history of drug-related controversies as he tested positive for banned anabolic steroid nandrolone in 2006, and rushed one of its senior officials to Dubai and hired a local lawyer to fight Asifs case.         
	Other top PCB officials are also working behind the scenes to get Asif off the hook by trying to use their connections in the influential circles in the UAE, the daily said.         
	Our biggest target is to get the player released and bring him back home on the first available flight, he said.         
	Meanwhile, confusion reigns supreme in absence of any official clarification on Asifs detention and local media in Dubai quoted the chief prosecutor as saying that charges have not yet been framed.         
	Chief prosecutor Mohammad Ali Rustom told a local newspaper in Dubai that forensic examinations have confirmed that the substance recovered from the Pakistan pacer at the Dubai Airport was opium.                 (PTI)

                                                  Leander: Mahesh   return a big boost
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Mahesh Bhupathi                                 
	New Delhi: Leander Paes on Wednesday said Mahesh Bhupathis return is a big boost for the Davis Cup squads morale.         
	Addressing a news conference ahead of Indias Davis Cup tie against Uzbekistan beginning Friday, Paes said he was delighted to get Bhupathi back into the fold.         
	Now that Mahesh is back in the team we are confident of winning the tie. He will take care of the doubles. Hes in great form. The kind of tennis Mahesh played in the Australian Open was excellent.         
	Bhupathi chose to remain silent for the most part. And whenever he was confronted with a question, he restricted his answers to a few syllables.         
	Asked what made him change his decision of not playing against lower-ranked teams in Davis Cup, Bhupathi said: You know about it. I have to play for India in order to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.         
	Paes said his boys are ready to beat Uzbekistan on grass. We faced a few obstacles but now we are well-prepared. It is painful for me to miss the tie but as a captain I have to put the team first.         
	Asked to specify the obstacles, the iconic Paes laughed and said: I leave it to your imagination.         
	Paes said he has made up his mind about the singles players but would reveal it later. I have to talk to a few more people before taking a final decision.         
	Prakash Amritraj and Rohan Bopanna are likely to play in singles though there is a feeling that Somdev Dev Varman may pip Prakash at the last moment.         
	Somdev said he felt more at home on clay courts. I am used to playing on clay courts and indoors. I played on grass only twice before; once in Germany and then in Junior Wimbledon.

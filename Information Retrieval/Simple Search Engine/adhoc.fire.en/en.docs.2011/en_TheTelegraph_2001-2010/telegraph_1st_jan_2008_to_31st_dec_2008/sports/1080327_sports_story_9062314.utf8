                  Monty Panesar in Napier on Wednesday. England beat New Zealand by 121 runs in the third Test to wrap up the series 2-1                     
	Napier: England spinner Monty Panesar claimed six wickets to wrap up the deciding third Test against New Zealand just after lunch on the fifth day on Wednesday.         
	New Zealand, chasing an improbable 553 to win, were bowled out for 431 in their second innings to give England victory by 121 runs and a 2-1 triumph in the series, their first overseas success since South Africa in 2005.         
	Debutant Tim Southee top-scored with 77 not out, including nine sixes, and his half century, off 29 balls, was the fastest by a New Zealander in Tests.         
	Panesar, who took three wickets to spark a familiar collapse of New Zealand0s batting on the fourth day, finished with career- best figures of six for 126.         
	They were spoiled by Southees barrage, however, with his three-over spell after lunch going for 41 runs.         
	Panesar did capture the valuable wickets of Ross Taylor (74) and Brendon McCullum (42) in the morning to realistically end New Zealands chances of batting out the day.

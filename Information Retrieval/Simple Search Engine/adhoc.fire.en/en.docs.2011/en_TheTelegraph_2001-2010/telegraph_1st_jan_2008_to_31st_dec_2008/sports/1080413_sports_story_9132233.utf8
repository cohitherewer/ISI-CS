                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bhupathi tipped to play singles 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: For the first time in seven years, Mahesh Bhupathi is likely to play a Davis Cup singles match on Sunday.         
	According to All India Tennis Association (AITA) sources, the Indians might decide to play Mahesh in place of Rohan Bopanna in the first reverse singles against Japan.         
	In the second singles, captain Leander Paes may replace Prakash Amritraj.         
	Since India have already pocketed the tie, the team management may rest both Bopanna and Amritraj in the dead rubber, sources said.         
	Bopanna is carrying an injury and shouldnt be risked in a match of no consequence. There is also talk about resting Prakash, who had to play a gruelling five-setter on the opening day.         
	The last time Bhupathi played in singles for India in the Davis Cup was in April 2001 against Japan. India won 3-2.         
	Paes also hasnt participated in singles since April 2006 when he scripted a memorable 3-2 triumph against Pakistan.         
	On Saturday, Bhupathi chose to side-step all controversy and said he enjoyed playing with Paes.         
	I feel better playing with him after the controversy, the winner of 10 Grand Slam titles said after he paired up with Paes to take win the doubles tie against Japan and take India to the World Group play-off.         
	Asked about his plans about the Olympics, Bhupathi said: Olympics and World Group play-offs are still far away. At the moment I am concentrating on the ATP Tours. I am playing one after another in Monte Carlo, Barcelona, Hamburg and French Open. I am focusing on them.         
	Paes said that playing with Bhupathi was great and they communicated well. We always had good wins together.         
	I knew this tie would not go down to the fifth match. If it had gone to that, I would not have been ready for the singles at all, as I was coming back after an ankle injury, Paes said.         
	 I am happy that we have a fairly convincing win against a team which comprised players from the top-200 besides a formidable doubles pair, he added.

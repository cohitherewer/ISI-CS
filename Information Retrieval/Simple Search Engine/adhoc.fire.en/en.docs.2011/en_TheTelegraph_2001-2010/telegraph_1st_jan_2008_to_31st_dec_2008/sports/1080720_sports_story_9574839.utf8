The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pre-Asia Cup message from SLC did the trick
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pre-Asia Cup message from SLC did the trick

	Calcutta: Its not known whether somebody in the Indian Board has reminded Gary Kirsten (who has drawn a blank as coach) that results matter the most. A senior Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) functionary did, however, give Trevor Bayliss a piece of his mind before the recent Asia Cup in Pakistan.         
	The 45-year-old Bayliss, an Australian who has turned out for New South Wales as a middle-order bat, has been Sri Lankas coach for almost a year. He succeeded compatriot Tom Moody.         
	Bayliss was unambiguously told that if the results didnt improve, then his (two-year) contract would be terminated  perhaps immediately after the Asia Cup... As it turned out, we retained the trophy, pointed out a very well-placed SLC source of The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Colombo, the gentleman added: The whip had to be cracked... Its not that Bayliss can rest on that achievement, though... He now knows that his involvement has to be bigger and that hell continue to be judged by the results.         
	With Mahela Jayawardene and Co. winning five of their six matches in the Asia Cup, Bayliss ODI record improved to nine wins, but the losses column reads 11. Clearly, he has his work cut out.         
	Bayliss Test record isnt any better: two wins, three losses. The next few weeks, therefore, will be as crucial for him as they will be for South African Kirsten.         
	Under Greg Chappells full-time successor, we just about managed to draw the home Test series against South Africa (in March-April) and, since then, have lost in the finals of two limited overs tournaments  in Dhaka and Karachi.         
	The first India-Sri Lanka Test of the newest series begins in Colombo on Wednesday. It will be a three-match affair.         
	Meanwhile, one learns that some within the SLC favour the appointment of a Sri Lankan as Bayliss deputy. We should look within too, remarked somebody in a position of authority.         
	In time, then, we could witness a fierce desi versus videshi debate across the Palk Strait.

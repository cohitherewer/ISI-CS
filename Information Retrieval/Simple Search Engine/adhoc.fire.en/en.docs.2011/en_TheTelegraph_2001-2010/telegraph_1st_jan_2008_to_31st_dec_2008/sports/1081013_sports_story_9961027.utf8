The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | HIGHLIGHTS
                                                                                                                                                                                                     HIGHLIGHTS
                      
	 When on 30, Zaheer Khan (57*) recorded his highest score in a Test match on Indian soil. His previous highest was 30 vs South Africa at Kanpur in 2004-05.         
	 Zaheer Khans score of 57 is his highest score batting at No. 9. His previous best was 46 vs The West Indies at Bridgetown.         
	 When on 53, Zaheer Khan (57*) bettered the highest score by any batsman at No. 9 at this venue. Englands Graham Dilley had made 52 here in December 1981.         
	 For the first time in his career, Zaheer Khan (57* amp; 5/91) recorded the unique feat of scoring a fifty and taking 5 wickets in an innings of a Test.         
	 By scoring a fifty and taking five wickets in an innings of a match, Zaheer Khan became only the third Indian to do so against Australia. Rusi Surti achieved this feat on the 1967-68 tour at Adelaide while Kapil Dev completed the allrounders double also at Adelaide on the 1991-92 tour.         
	 Only twice now have Indian No. 8 and 9 scored fifties in the same innings of a Test against Australia and this has happened in successive Test matches as well.         
	 The 52 extras conceded by Australia now equals the most conceded by them in a Test. Australia had conceded 52 extras against England in Brisbane, 1982-83.         
	 When he was on 7, Hayden brought up 800 runs on Indian soil in 8 Tests at an average of 53.73. He became the 10th visiting player to score 800 plus runs on Indian soil. For the record, Clive Llyod (1359) has scored the most runs by a visiting player in India.           COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

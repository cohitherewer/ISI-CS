            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa allrounder Jacques Kallis said on Wednesday that he felt greatly honoured and humbled to be named as the top cricketer for 2007 after scoring more runs than anyone else in the year.         
	The 32-year-old hit 1,210 runs at an average of 86.42 and took 20 wickets for just 25.75 runs each to become the fifth player to win Wisden cricket almanacs annual award after Ricky Ponting, Shane Warne, Andrew Flintoff and last years winner, Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	You feel very humble when you realise what an accolade it is and you look at the names of the other cricketers to be honoured, Kallis said in a Cricket South Africa release.         
	Meanwhile, Zaheer Khan, Ian Bell, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Ottis Gibson and Ryan Sidebottom were named as the five Cricketers of the Year for their achievements in the English season in 2007.

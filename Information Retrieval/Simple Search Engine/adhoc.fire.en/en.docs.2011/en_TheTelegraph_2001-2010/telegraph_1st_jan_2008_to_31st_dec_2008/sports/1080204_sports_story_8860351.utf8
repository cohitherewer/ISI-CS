	Mumbai: Orissa duo of captain Shiv Sundar Das and Haladhar Das rescued East Zone from complete collapse with contrasting half-centuries on the first day of their four-day Duleep Trophy league tie against South Zone here on Sunday. 
    
	Shiv Sundar anchored the innings with a diligent knock of 82 spanning 241 minutes and inclusive of 12 fours while wicketkeeper Haladhar cracked a breezy unbeaten 78 in 143 minutes with 13 fours to rally his team after the fall of his captain at 170. 
    
	The duos fighting display helped East Zone, who won the toss and chose to bat, end the opening day at 265 for seven with Haladhar, who has faced 128 balls, and his statemate Debasis Mohanty (six in 32 minutes) at the crease. 
    
	Earlier, East lost wickets at regular intervals with Shiv Sundar, who negotiated 160 balls, standing like a rock at one end. They were 62 for three and 134 for five before recovering. 
    
	Karnataka duo R. Vinay Kumar and N. C. Aiyappa shared four wicket equally to have East on the back foot at 102 for four and then lanky off-spinner R. Ashwin got rid off Palash Jyoti Das to further deepen Easts difficulties. 
    
	Shiv Sundar and Haladhar joined forces to add 36 runs for the sixth wicket before the Test discard, looking all set for a hundred after playing some super cover drives, edged Ashwins sharp off break to slip fielder Murali Vijay. 
    
	Haladhar and Tushar Saha put on a quickfire 71 runs in 81 balls for the seventh wicket to deny South from taking a stranglehold. 
    
	East got into difficulties after play started 105 minutes late because of wet underfoot conditions following a sharp unseasonal shower this morning. 
    
	Arindam Das went for a duck in the third over when he was trapped leg before by Vinay Kumar. 
    
	A brief recovery followed when Shiv Sundar and Anustup Majumdar (19) put on 40 runs before the latter edged Aiyappa to the slip cordon, giving Vijay the chance to pluck the first of his three catches in this position.

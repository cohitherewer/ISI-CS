The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | They dont need me, says Warne
                                                                                                                                                                                                     They dont need me, says Warne
                      
	Melbourne: The Australian cricket team is struggling to find a decent replacement for him but spin legend Shane Warne has ruled out coming out of retirement, saying that the side no longer needs him.         
	Asserting that he was happily retired and does not have the inclination to return, Warne said he has not been approached to come back.         
	Look, Im happily retired. The Australian sides playing well. They played well in the West Indies.         
	They dont need me at the moment. I dont think the call will come. If the call comes Ill weigh it up at the time Warne said.         
	Warne, however, maintained that he was fit despite being away from international cricket.         
	Im fit enough, as in running around the block, Im probably as fit as Ive ever been. I bowled three balls in Brisbane the other day. Theyre the first since the Indian Premier League  whats that, four months? he said.         
	Australia have pencilled in Cameron White and Jason Krejza to fill the spin void left by Warne.         
	The legendary leg-spinner said it would be interesting to see how the team plays the duo.         
	It will be interesting to see what they do, whether they strengthen the batting with Cameron White as the two spinners or play an out and out spinner in Krejza, Warne said.         
	It might depend on the conditions and what make-up they want in their side before they pick their team. It will be interesting to see what they do, he added. (PTI)

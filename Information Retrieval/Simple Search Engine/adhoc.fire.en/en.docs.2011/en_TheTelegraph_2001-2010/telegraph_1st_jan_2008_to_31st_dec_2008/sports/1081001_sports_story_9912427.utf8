                                                                                                                                                                                             Former captains welcome Murali to Bengal fold
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: Muttiah Muralidharan has not signed on the dotted line yet. But Test crickets highest wicket-takers decision to make himself available for some of the knockout matches during Bengals Plate group campaign in the Ranji Trophy this season has been welcomed by all. That the youngsters will gain from his rich experience is the general consensus.         
	[I am yet to sign a contract with them (Bengal)... I am not available for the group stage... If it works out (not clashing with international commitments) then I may play for Bengal, may be in the knockout stage, Murali was quoted as saying in an agency report.]         
	According to a CAB official, his signing is only a matter of formality since he has confirmed his availability in writing.         
	The Telegraph spoke to some of the former Bengal captains and the following are the excerpts (alphabetically):         
	SAMBARAN BANERJEE: Muralis presence is a big bonus for Bengal. The youngsters can only gain by playing alongside him. We dont need him to play too many matches his availability in one/two vital matches is enough for the side. Among available foreign players, he is the ideal choice. Youngsters like Sourashish Lahiri, Ritam Kundu, Iresh Saxena can only gain from Muralis experience. It should be a dream come true for them.         
	GOPAL BOSE: If Bengal are planning to play him in the knockout stages, it will not be a bad idea. Bengals dropping out of the Super League last year was just an aberration They are too good a side to not be there this year. If he is there in the knockout stages, Bengal will gain immensely. His mental approach to the game, how he prepares himself before a match, how he deals with depression, what he tells himself when he has a bad day on the field         
	DEEP DASGUPTA: Its a brilliant idea Murali has played for so long and is a good pro. His rich experience in playing under all sorts of conditions will obviously come in handy. His presence may be a little harsh for Bengal youngsters On the other hand, they will stand to gain playing alongside him.   
	ARUN LAL: Its a wonderful opportunity for the youngsters. He is a true champion and it will be a great chance for the players to gain from his experience. A positive development for Bengal cricket.

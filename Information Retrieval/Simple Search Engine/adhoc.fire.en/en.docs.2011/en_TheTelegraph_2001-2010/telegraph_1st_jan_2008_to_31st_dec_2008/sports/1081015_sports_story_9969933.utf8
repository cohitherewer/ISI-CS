            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: New Zealand have retained the fourth place in the ICC ODI Championship table but have dropped three valuable ratings points despite their 2-1 series win over Bangladesh.         
	New Zealand went into the series leading Bangladesh by 71 rating points and this gap meant they were expected to win the series convincingly. Their failure to win all three ODIs has cost them three points. New Zealand joined India on 113 ratings points but are ahead of Mahendra Singh Dhonis side when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point.               
	1. Australia 131; 2. South Africa 118; 3. England 116; 4. New Zealand 113; 5. India 113; 6. Pakistan 110; 7. Sri Lanka 105; 8. West Indies 95; 9. Bangladesh 47; 10. Ireland 22.

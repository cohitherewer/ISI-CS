	Deferment will hurt Waca: CEO  Melbourne: Anguished at the postponement of the $ 6,000 Champions Twenty20 League to October next year, Western Australian Cricket Association (Waca) on Saturday said they could be seeking compensation from the organisers.  Though Waca Chief Executive Graeme Wood was yet to be officially informed about the postponement, he said they could lose as much as $2 million.  Cricket Victoria too has said that it will press for compensation from the nation rsquo;s cricket Board.  ldquo;It certainly would have been very beneficial financially. We stand to lose a minimum $500,000. And if the team performed very well and we got into the top four and the top two, there was significant gains financially, rdquo; Wood said.

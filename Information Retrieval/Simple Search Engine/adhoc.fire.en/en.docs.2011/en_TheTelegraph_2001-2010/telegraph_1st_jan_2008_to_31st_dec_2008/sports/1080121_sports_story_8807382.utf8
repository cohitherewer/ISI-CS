	Perth: V.V.S. Laxman and MoM Irfan Pathan acknowledged that they woke up on Sunday feeling different. Captain Anil Kumble, though, felt it was just another day. 
    
	As for Sachin Tendulkar, even if he didnt wake up with a different feeling, he certainly looked different on the morning after the superb win at the Waca. 
    
	Have I done a Bjorn Borg? Sachin quipped, when attention was drawn to his chikna look after days of sporting a stubble. 
    
	The announcement of the ODI squad caused heartburn in some quarters but till that was done, late in the afternoon, there was a relaxed air in the Team India camp. 
    
	Most (including Kumble) went out shopping followed by lunch, while the injured Yuvraj Singh preferred the Hyatt Regencys fitness centre. 
    
	The team got together for dinner, with the mouth-watering spread arranged from an Indian restaurant which did the catering at the Waca. 
    
	In the lead-up to the official celebrations, The Telegraph spoke to some of the dramatis personae. 
    
	Heres what they said (alphabetically): 
    
	RAHUL DRAVID: Weve had a good win Now, we need to take the momentum forward to Adelaide All wins are satisfying Ive never believed in rating them As a professional, I take satisfaction from all wins. 
    
	SOURAV GANGULY: Its a great feeling, yes It wouldve been nice to make a big contribution, but everyone fails In fact, its the first time I failed since my Test comeback in December 2006. 
    
	ANIL KUMBLE: For me, this is just another day I dont dwell too much on what has happened We won yesterday, now its time for a fresh challenge. 
    
	V.V.S. LAXMAN: Yes, I woke up feeling different The win will remain very special, but its difficult saying whether its our best overseas I think the win in Adelaide, on the last tour, came from a difficult position.

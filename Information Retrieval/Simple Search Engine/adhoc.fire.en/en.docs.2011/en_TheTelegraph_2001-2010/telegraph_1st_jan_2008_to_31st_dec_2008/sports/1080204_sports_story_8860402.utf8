 -Sharapova comes of age

	The mens event in the 2008 Aussie Open received golden accolades for its quality of play and exciting matches. The womens championship, replete with mundane matches, was significant for the coming of age of 20 year old Maria Sharapova, who ruthlessly demolished the field. Justine Henin, the world No. 1 on a 32 match-winning streak, was humiliated 4-6, 0-6. 
    
	The Australian Open was Sharapovas third Grand Slam title. Her career started in 2002 when she was 15 years old. Two years later, at 17, she was the youngest to win Wimbledon and then in 2006 she claimed the US Open crown. Her rise to stardom has been fuelled not by luck but tunnel-visioned focus and hard work. 
    
	She is no Cinderella, and when the clock strikes 12 in the next 4 to 5 years she could be the richest woman sportsperson in the world, worth more than $250 million! 
    
	Her earnings from endorsements alone in 2007 was reported to be close to $30 million! I cannot see the ageing Williams sisters, Henin, Mauresmo, Davenport, all multiple Grand Slam title winners, posing a serious threat to Sharapovas supremacy. 
    
	Her challenge will come from the barrage of young ladies from behind the former Iron Curtain who have practically taken over womens tennis. 
    
	The four semi-finalists in Melbourne were one Russian (Sharapova), two Serbs (Jankovic and Ivanovic) and one Slovak (Hantuchova)! In the womens draw of 128, 41 were from Iron Curtain countries! The magic formula for their success is an unsatiable hunger for success brought to fruition by American know-how and facilities. 
    
	I have seen the girls from former Czechoslovakia, Croatia, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia etc. in play at the French Championship, and they fight to the last point as if their lives were at stake. Success is a matter of life and death for them and their parents who have staked all. Sadly, there are many who fall by the wayside. 
    
	Sharapovas game seems to have just one flaw. She operates only on full power and this requires her to be fine-tuned to her peak in all her big matches. If things go wrong she does not have a lower gear or a game plan to fall back on. With her there is no compromise. She attacks every shot with a predetorial roar, irrespective of the consequences. 
    
	A glamorous image and sporting excellence seldom go hand in hand. Both require time and nurturing. Sharapova has managed both with rare aplomb from the time she wore an all black cocktail dress inspired by Breakfast at Tiffanys at the US Open. 
    
	Anna Ivanovic does not have the steely eyes of the blonde Sharapova. She is a brunette, looks soft and totally different. But the fundamentals of glamour are there, and her tennis has much room for improvement. They would both be at home if they walked on a ramp into the Rod Laver Arena. It would send Hugh Hefner of Playboy scrambling for his chequebook. 
    
	Sania Mirza could also grace a ramp at any Centre Court. Her third-round, 6-7, 4-6 defeat at the hands of No. 8 seed Venus Williams  winner of six Grand Slam titles  took her to No. 29 in the WTA rankings, making her the best in Asia! 
    
	She is improving all the time but injuries keep pulling her down, not allowing her to put in the extra physical work required for continuous top level play. Without this, progress is almost impossible. 
    
	Perhaps she is impatient and doing too much too quickly. She must be patient while rebuilding her physical fitness. You need a deep foundation to build a skyscraper. 
    
	Sania could not resist, and one could hardly blame her, from playing in her first Grand Slam final despite a torn thigh muscle. A two-three week lay-off will pull her down once again and the rehabilitation process will have to be repeated. To sum up one would say it was a very good performance with a sad ending.

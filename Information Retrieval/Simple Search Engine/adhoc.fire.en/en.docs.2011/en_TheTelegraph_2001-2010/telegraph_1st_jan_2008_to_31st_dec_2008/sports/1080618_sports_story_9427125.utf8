The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lawson hopes for Asif return
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lawson hopes for Asif return
                      
	Karachi: Mohammed Asifs prolonged detention in Dubai has left the entire Pakistani cricket team concerned, says coach Geoff Lawson, who wants to have the embattled pacer back in the side as soon as he is released.         
	Asif has been in detention after being caught with a small quantity of contraband drugs at the Dubai International Airport on June 1.         
	Lawson said Pakistani players might be busy celebrating their tri-series win over India but they are equally concerned about their detained teammate.         
	We are praying and hoping for his early release and I would love to see Asif back in the side, Lawson said after reaching Lahore from Dhaka.         
	Everyone in the team has been talking about him not only as a cricketer but also as a person as well, he added.         
	Although impressed with Sohail Tanvir and Wahab Riaz, who spearheaded the Pakistani attack in Asifs absence, Lawson said the two needed more time before rising to Asifs stature.

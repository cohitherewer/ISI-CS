The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis should be cautious 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Lewis should be cautious 
    - I hate driving for points             SIMON ARRON            Lewis Hamilton                                 
	Restraint does not come naturally to Lewis Hamilton, but it could be his greatest ally if he is to clinch the 2008 Formula One world championship. The McLaren driver leads Ferrari rival Felipe Massa by seven points and knows that second place in each of the seasons final three races will be enough to clinch the title.         
	The notion of racing to finish second is anathema to Hamilton, but needs must. I hate driving for points, he said, but I think we can all see the benefit of that approach at the moment.         
	It is a situation that has been created by the rulebook  and if Hamilton should take the title by stealth he will owe a slight debt of gratitude to bitter foe Ferrari.         
	Motorsports governing body, the FIA, implemented the current scoring system  10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 to the leading eight finishers  in 2003. It was a direct response to events of the previous season, when points were awarded 10, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1 to the top six. Michael Schumacher took his Ferrari to victory in nine of the first 12 Grand Prixs and had the title sewn up by late July.         
	Such dominance stifled long-term interest in the championship and triggered a change in thinking that had a desired, but iniquitous, effect: Schumacher did not clinch the 2003 title until the final race, even though he had scored six victories to challenger Kimi Raikkonens one.         
	If the old scoring system remained in place, Hamilton would lead Massa by a single point and the championship run-in would have a different complexion. As things stand, he can finish second to the Brazilian in each of the forthcoming races  Japan on Sunday, then China and Brazil  and take the title by a point.         
	Such anomalies are nothing new. In 1958 Stirling Moss won four Grand Prixs and Tony Brooks three, but Mike Hawthorns solitary victory and a string of second places were enough to make him Britains first F1 champion.         
	The prevailing scoring system  8-6-4-3-2 to the top five, plus a bonus point for fastest lap  favoured consistency, although Moss effectively talked himself out of the title. Hawthorn was initially excluded from second place in Portugal, following a push-start, but he was reinstated after Moss gave evidence on his rivals behalf.         
	The fact I never won the title isnt relevant, Moss said, because I know for sure that I was quicker than some drivers who did. I preferred to lose knowing Id driven quickly enough to win rather than losing simply because I hadnt driven fast enough.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jacques Kallis waiting to join 10000 club 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jacques Kallis waiting to join 10000 club 
            NILESH BHATTACHARYA                       
	Ahmedabad: Jacques Kallis is relishing a new hunger for success. Having surpassed Sir Don Bradman to become fifth on the list of Test crickets leading centurions here, the prolific allrounder is now eagerly waiting for another landmark: 10,000 runs.         
	The 32-year-olds 30th century (132) in the first innings has took him close to that mark (9,641 in 118 Tests) and he believes it would be a perfect jewel in his crown.         
	Scoring century No. 30 is a special moment. Im enjoying every bit of my career now. The body may not be taking it the way I would have loved to, but the desire is still there. Joining 10,000-club will be a jewel in the crown, Kallis told The Telegraph on Saturday. Ive never dreamt of scoring 30 centuries or 10,000 runs. Its a great moment for me.         
	Kallis was not included in the South African side for the ICC World Twenty20 at home in September. But the worlds leading allrounder came back strongly, winning the Man of the Series award in Pakistan.         
	AB de Villiers, who was adjudged Man of the Match for his maiden double hundred, described Kallis as a legend, saying his tips had helped him stay focussed during his innings.         
	According to Kallis, the future of South African cricket is safely placed in the De Villerss hands.         
	We now have a nice blend of experience and youth in the side. Probably for the first time in my career I can see a bowling attack who can take 20 wickets in the subcontinent. Its a great sign for our cricket, he said.         
	Kallis also said the absence of Sachin Tendulkar, who was ruled out of the series with a groin injury, would add pressure to the home side.         
	Kallis, like his captain Graeme Smith, is also looking for a 2-0 win in the ongoing series. India will certainly bounce back in Kanpur. But we are pretty confident of another win there, he said.

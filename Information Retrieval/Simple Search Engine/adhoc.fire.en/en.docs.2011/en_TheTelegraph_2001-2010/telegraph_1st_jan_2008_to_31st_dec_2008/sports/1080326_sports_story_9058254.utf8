                                                   Murali, Vaas tie WI in knots
                      
	Guyana: Muttiah Muralidharan and Chaminda Vaas took three wickets each as Sri Lanka restricted West Indies to 269 for nine on the third day of the first Test in Georgetown, Guyana, on Monday.         
	The West Indies were still 207 runs in arrears at the close, needing seven runs to avert the follow-on after Sri Lanka had compiled 476 for eight declared on the first two days.         
	Tail-ender Jerome Taylor was unbeaten on 22 at the end of the day with Darren Powell on six. Muralidharan finished with three for 104 from 38 overs while Vaas ended with three for 45 from 22 overs.         
	Ramnaresh Sarwan celebrated his return to international cricket after a six-month injury absence with a fine hard-working 80 from 199 deliveries.

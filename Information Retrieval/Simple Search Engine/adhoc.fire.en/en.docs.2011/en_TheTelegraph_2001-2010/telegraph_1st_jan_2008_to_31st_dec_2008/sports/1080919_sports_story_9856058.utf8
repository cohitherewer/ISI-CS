The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Trouble brewing in JCT
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Trouble brewing in JCT
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The new regulation of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), that makes it mandatory for all I-League clubs to declare themselves as commercial entities, has put JCT in a quandary.         
	According to sources, most of the players in the Phagwara side havent received their salaries for the past couple of months and the foreign players are demanding release from the club.         
	JCT, who finished runners-up in the inaugural I-League, are one of the hot contenders for the title this season.         
	Sources said that veteran Brazilian striker Marcos Pereira has almost struck a deal with Mohun Bagan and is expected to arrive in Calcutta on Friday while Nigerian defender Julius is negotiating with East Bengal.         
	JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh confirmed that the players are not getting their salaries in time. Yes, there is a problem. But we are trying to solve it as soon as possible. Things should be fine before the start of the I-League.         
	The new AIFF rule, Sukhwinder said, has created all the trouble for the Punjab club, who are known to be the best paymasters in Indian football.         
	Till last year, we were playing as JCT Mills and the company was taking care of all the expenses, Sukhwinder said.         
	Under the new rule, the club has to be separated as a commercial entity and we renamed it as JCT Sports Private Limited.         
	Now the main company has to transfer the money to the club. There are some legal issues involved and it also needs the approval of the Government.         
	Till the time it is cleared, the company cannot transfer the money to the club account, the former India player and coach said.         
	Whatever the reasons, things are not well in the JCT ranks. With less than a week left for the start of the I-League, the players are unhappy despite repeated assurances from the management that payments will be made very soon.         
	Sukhwinder confirmed that both Julius and Brazilian striker Eduardo Escobar have demanded increase in their salaries.         
	I know they have received bigger offers from other clubs.         
	But we cannot agree to their demands since they have signed two-year contracts with us. If worst comes to worst, we will play the league with our local players.

	Nagpur: The Australian cricket team on Saturday clarified that fast bowler Brett Lee had been away from the field due to dehydration, and not due to the viral fever he had before the start of the fourth Test.         
	You all know that two days before the match, Lee was suffering from a virus and that he recovered from it and passed the fitness test, a spokesman said. Lee was ill during the innings and at the start of the Australian innings (on Friday) he had dehydration and nausea. He was placed on drips for half an hour and you saw he came out to bat today, he added.         
	 Simon Katich, spoke on the pacers availability Sunday: Hopefully. He had the day off pretty much today. He is a bit brighter today than he was yesterday.

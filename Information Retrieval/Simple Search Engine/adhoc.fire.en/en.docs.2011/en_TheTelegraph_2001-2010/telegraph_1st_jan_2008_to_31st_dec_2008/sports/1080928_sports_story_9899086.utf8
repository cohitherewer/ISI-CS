The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Game being played at two levels
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Game being played at two levels
  - The Sharad Pawar - Jagmohan Dalmiya relationship         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Jagmohan Dalmiya                                 
	Mumbai: Sharad Pawar personally took Jagmohan Dalmiya around the Cricket Centre at the Wankhede (where the Board and the Mumbai Cricket Association are housed), on Saturday morning, but his group had no qualms in removing Brijesh Patel from the finance committee as he continues to be viewed as a Dalmiya loyalist.         
	Much the same thing happened on Friday, on the eve of the AGM, when Pawar insisted Dalmiya attend the dinner hosted by him. A few hours earlier, though, his men had appointed Dalmiya-baiter Raja Venkat on the senior selection committee.         
	Pawars innings as the Board president has got over, but he will continue to wield much influence.         
	It appears a game is being played, that too at two levels, is how a well-placed source of The Telegraph put it.         
	Dalmiya, however, ensured that the Prasun Mukherjees and Samar Pauls, who were thrashed in the last Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections, didnt make it to any of the committees.         
	Also out is Sourav Gangulys elder brother, Snehashish, whod been on the technical committee. Snehashish too has been in the anti-Dalmiya camp.         
	In whats being seen as a tactical move, nobody raised the Dalmiya issue (particularly the bit about claiming Rs 47 crore or so from him) at the AGM. He didnt say anything either, again part of strategy.         
	Incidentally, Dalmiya had an interaction with the IPL chairman and commissioner, Lalit Modi, and former Board president Inderjit Singh Bindra, on the sidelines of the AGM.         
	The issue: Over Rs 8 crore spent by Mukherjee and Co. during the inaugural edition of the IPL, earlier this year.         
	Modi clarified that Shah Rukh Khans Red Chillies Entertainment wouldnt have to reimburse that amount to the CAB and, strictly speaking, each hosting association was only entitled to get Rs 3.5 crore for the matches.         
	Apparently, Modi expressed surprise at the expenses incurred by the CAB. For example, well over Rs 1 crore on food alone during the seven home matches of the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	With the reimbursement issue unresolved, Modi could come to Calcutta for a one-on-one with Dalmiya.         
	For his part, Dalmiya said: A huge amount has been spent and, clearly, the CAB cant be left to bleed... Its something which has to be resolved.         
	Interesting times seem to be ahead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Icon status for Sehwag
                                                   Icon status for Sehwag
                                      Sehwag    
	Mumbai: Virender Sehwag was on Tuesday added to the icon players list by a unanimous verdict and will play for the Delhi franchise owned by the GMR Group, the Indian Premier League (IPL) announced on Tuesday.         
	Sehwag has been granted icon status after a meeting of the IPL with the eight franchises. He will command the same base price ($400,000) like the other icons, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi said.         
	Sehwag was earlier in the day named as captain of the Delhi Daredevils.         
	Modi added that following the withdrawal of the demand to make V.V.S Laxman as an icon player by the Hyderabad franchisee (Deccan Chronicle), he wont be part of this elite group of players.         
	Hyderabad franchisee withdrew their demand for making Laxman as an icon player, Modi said.         
	Modi also said while four Australian players have opted out of the auction, the others will go under the hammer but may not be seen in the league if they are busy playing in the scheduled Test and ODI series in Pakistan.         
	It has been made clear to the franchisees that the Australian players who will be available for the auction would not be able to play in the IPL this year if they are busy playing in Pakistan, Modi explained.         
	Modi said all the Indian players contracted to the BCCI (barring the icons) are available to be auctioned off.         
	With the naming of Sehwag as an icon player, the number of players going under the hammer has been reduced to 77.           (PTI)

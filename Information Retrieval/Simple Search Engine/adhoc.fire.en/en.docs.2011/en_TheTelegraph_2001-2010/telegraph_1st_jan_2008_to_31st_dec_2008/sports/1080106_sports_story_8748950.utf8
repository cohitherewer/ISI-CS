The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal slide further
                                                East Bengal slide further
                      
	Margao: Sporting Clube de Goa pushed East Bengal further into the danger zone, beating the three-time champions 1-0 in their Round IX I-League match at the Nehru Stadium on Saturday. Adjei Lawrence scored the winner in the 52nd minute.         
	Sporting, by notching up their second successive win, brightened their survival hopes with nine points while East Bengal remained on seven. This was East Bengals fifth defeat in a row.         
	The match was crucial for both the struggling teams. Sporting had more scoring opportunities in the match and Elijah Obagbemiro sounded the first warning in the eighth minute when his powerful shot from inside the box was blocked by East Bengal goalkeeper Subrata Paul.         
	Three minutes later, Micky Fernandess long ranger missed the target narrowly.         
	Elijah, who kept the East Bengal defence under pressure, was unlucky in the 26th minute as well when his shot from close range hit the post.         
	East Bengal were more intent on guarding their citadel except for a Surkumar Singh 30-yard shot that was saved by the Sporting goalkeeper. (PTI)

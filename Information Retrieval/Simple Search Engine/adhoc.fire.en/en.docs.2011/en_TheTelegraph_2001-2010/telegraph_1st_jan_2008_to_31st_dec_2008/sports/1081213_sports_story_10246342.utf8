                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mumbai collapse, Orissa stumble
                      
	Cuttack: Orissa lost three wickets in the last eight balls of the day to squander the initiative after bowling out Mumbai for a paltry 180 on Day I of the Ranji Trophy Super League Group A match here Friday.         
	Having restricted the starstudded Mumbai batting lineup, Orissa were tottering at three for three at stumps on the opening day.         
	To make matters worse for the hosts, captain and key batsman Shiv Sundar Das, having sustained an injury to his right hand while fielding, is unlikely to play further.

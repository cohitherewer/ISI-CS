The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Greece have a point to prove
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Greece have a point to prove
          
	Seekirchen: Greece have one main goal at the European Championship: Earning respect.         
	The team came from nowhere to win Euro 2004 in Portugal, and four years later they want to show that was no fluke and establish international credibility.         
	Greece had 10 wins in 12 games to easily win their qualifying group with 31 points  the most by any of the 16 teams that reached Euro 2008  while Fifas world rankings for June kept the team in their record-high eighth place for a third straight month.         
	But theres still a point to prove, said defender Giourkas Seitaridis.         
	At every game we have to demonstrate that we really did deserve to be called European champions, Seitaridis said. At this Euro, we have come as the champions and well be feeling greater pressure because we have to show that what happened four years ago did not happen by chance.         
	Coach Otto Rehhagel had been criticised for adopting negative tactics with a defensive lineup. The German has made gradual changes to a squad which failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, mainly bringing in youthful strikers to improve scoring options.         
	We need a little time to prepare because some of the (older) players have retired and some new players have come in, Seitaridis said. Well need more time for us to bond better.         
	Ten players in the current squad won the 2004 title, with the more recent additions including Celtic striker Georgios Samaras, Panathinaikos defender Nikos Spiropoulos and reserve goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas of Greek team OFI Crete.         
	This is a dream season for me, Spiropoulos said. Sure we feel pressure, because were the champions. But stress is good for you.         
	At Wednesdays training near the Austrian city of Salzburg, five players were rested to recover from minor injuries, team doctor Haris Christopoulos said.         
	Alexandros Tziolis, Christos Patsatzoglou, Vassilis Torosidis and Angelos Charisteas all have thigh strains, while playmaker Giorgos Karagounis was recovering from a right knee tendon inflammation.         
	All five were expected to return to training Friday, the doctor said.         
	Greece play Sweden, Russia and Spain in Group D.           (AP)

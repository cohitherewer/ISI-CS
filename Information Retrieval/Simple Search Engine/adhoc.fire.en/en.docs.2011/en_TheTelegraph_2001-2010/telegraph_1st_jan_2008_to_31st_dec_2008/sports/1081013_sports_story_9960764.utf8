The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We couldnt create chances: Rozario
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We couldnt create chances: Rozario
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Stanley Rozario was a beleagured man on Sunday. His new stint with East Bengal had got off to a bright start with a 3-1 win over United SC in the opening round but two subsequent losses have left him somewhat weary.         
	Still, Rozario saw positives from the teams performance and strongly backed his players.         
	Ball possession, that was our biggest positive, Rozario said. But we couldnt create the chances. Rozario said the result must be seen in the context of the side missing four key players. I think 0-2 is not a fair result. The first goal was okay, but the second should not have been there, he said.         
	Nirmal (Chettri) was forced to play out of position. (Yusif) Yakubu and Parveen (Kumar) were also playing in different positions. And had Parveens header gone in, Rozario wondered.         
	East Bengal played the 4-2-4 formation with Yakubu in the midfield. Rozario defended his gameplan. If I had to keep Yakubu up front, I would have had to plan the whole strategy for one position, he said.         
	Ironically, thats the area Air India exploited successfully.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwags return not confirmed
                                                   Sehwags return not confirmed
  - Brainstorming session for batsmen ahead of Sri Lanka tie       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            Sehwag    
	Calcutta: Team Indias batting failure at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday, against world champions Australia, prompted a brainstorming session on Monday afternoon where only the batters were present.         
	Senior pro Virender Sehwag was very much there (he attended the days optional nets too), but its to be seen whether he makes a comeback in Tuesdays crucial ODI versus Sri Lanka.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Sehwag had actually been dropped on Sunday, even though captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni suggested otherwise.         
	Viru wasnt 100 per cent fit, Dhoni told the media after the 50-run defeat, a loss which has added to the pressure of staying in the race to make the best-of-three finals of the Commonwealth Bank series.         
	Apparently, Sehwag had been very keen to play and that contradicts the bit about him either having a sore shoulder, a side strain or even a mysterious hip problem.         
	Without really clearing the air, a member of the team management said: For Viru to play, well have to go back to four specialist bowlers Its going to be a tough call as the Sri Lankans tend to target the fifth bowler, particularly if hes not a specialist And, so, one cant say that Viru will definitely make the XI         
	The decision has been put on hold till the full-fledged team meeting, some hours before the day-night encounter.         
	Sehwag, clearly, will have a sleepless night and its somewhat baffling that his qualities (even if they havent exactly wowed the purists) have suddenly been forgotten.         
	Hailed as a matchwinner one day, given the kick the next... But then, at 29, Sehwag doesnt qualify for the young brigades membership.         
	For the record, over 182 ODIs, Sehwag has a phenomenal strike-rate of almost 97.         
	Meanwhile, Dhoni and Co. will be reminded by a member of the team management that their priority is to beat Sri Lanka and all other things (including the Indian Premier League) can wait.         
	Irfan Pathan, of course, would like us to believe that the League-related matters havent been a distraction. If that was so, then a reminder to stay focused on the job at hand wouldnt be on the agenda for Tuesday.         
	Anyway, Pathan and his teammates have the chance to correct a popular perception.

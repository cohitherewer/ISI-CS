The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji to miss 5 ODIs, warned of life ban
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bhajji to miss 5 ODIs, warned of life ban
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                Harbhajan Singh and Sreesanth                             
	Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh on Wednesday got away with a five-match ODI ban for slapping his India team- mate Sreesanth during an Indian Premier League (IPL) match.         
	While the off-spinner was also warned by the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCI) of a life ban for any future misconduct, the pacer was asked to improve his on-field behaviour.         
	Harbhajan seems to have got away lightly. What softened the stand of the hardliners within the BCCI and the committee itself was his appeal for leniency and an assurance from him a few days ago that there would not be any misconduct in the future.         
	The appeal, it is learnt, was made on the advice of well-wishers within the BCCI.         
	Sreesanth, despite his tears in public, also didnt want the whole thing to be blown out of proportion as it affected his India teammate.         
	A day after BCCI-appointed commissioner Sudhir Nanavati submitted a 14-page report, the disciplinary committee acted swiftly to impose the ban on the off-spinner who will now miss the forthcoming tri-series in Bangladesh (June 8-14) and two matches of the Asia Cup in Pakistan (June 24-July 6).         
	The disciplinary committee comprising president Sharad Pawar, president-elect Shashank Manohar and vice-president Chirayu Amin met at the cricket centre in Mumbai.         
	The 27-year-old Harbhajan has already been banned from the ongoing IPL and fined Rs 3 crore match fee for the level 4 offence for the incident which took place in Mohali on April 25.         
	The committee accordingly decided to ban Harbhajan for five one-day Internationals, starting today (Wednesday) and further observed that any further instance of misconduct will invoke a life ban, the BCCI said in a statement after the hearing.         
	The committee invoked rule 3.2.1 of the BCCI regulations for players, team officials, managers, umpires and administrators. Under this provision, the maximum punishment that can be meted out to a player is a ban up to a maximum of 5 ODIs and/or 3 Test matches, the statement said.         
	Pawar said a copy of the report was given to Harbhajan who was heard by the committee before a final decision on the quantum of punishment was taken.         
	The BCCI also told Sreesanth to mend his ways. Many in the BCCI are quite fed up with him and some see him as a problem child.         
	The fact that the BCCI has made Sreesanths role in the whole episode public is more than a slap on the pacers attitude.         
	The Board is constrained to warn you for your behaviour on the field and in the event you do not improve your behaviour, the Board would be constrained to take appropriate decision, the letter written by secretary Niranjan Shah said.         
	The disciplinary committee also considered Sreesanth. He has to improve a lot and if he is does something similar in future, he will be dealt with a firm hand, Shah later told reporters.         
	Asked how Harbhajan reacted to his ban, Shah said, he is okay, he knows that he is guilty and the BCCI has also given a warning that if he gets involved in any further misconduct, he will be banned for life.         
	He has learnt his lesson, he knows exactly where he stands, he added.         
	Shah made it clear that the BCCI would not tolerate any such indiscipline.         
	It is sure that if any indiscipline is seen on the field the Board would be very strict. It wont allow itself to be taken for granted, he said.         
	Nanavati, who inquired into the slapping row, is satisfied with the decision taken by the disciplinary committee and said it was quick, appropriate and would set an example.         
	There are two parts to this decision. First, the decision was quick. To keep any one in tension including the culprit and people at large is not proper, Nanavati said.         
	The second thing, the punishment is appropriate as it is not less not more. , Nanavati said.

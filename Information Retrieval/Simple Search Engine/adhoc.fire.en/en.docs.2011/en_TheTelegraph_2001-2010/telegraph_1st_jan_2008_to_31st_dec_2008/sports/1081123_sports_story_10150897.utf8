                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dec. 23 date for AIFF polls
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) elections will be held in the capital on December 23.         
	The AIFF executive committee, which met here on Saturday, deliberated for nearly two hours before deciding to go ahead with the elections despite the absence of its critically ill president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.         
	The meeting, which was presided over by senior vice-president Praful Patel, agreed to hold the elections for all posts. However, no one is likely to file nomination for the post of the president.         
	Initially, we decided to hold the elections for all posts except the president since Mr. Das Munshi is not well, said a senior member of the AIFF.         
	But later it was decided to have the election for the presidents post also, even though no one will file nomination for that particular post.         
	The executive committee unanimously nominated Patel the president-in-charge in the absence of Das Munshi till the elections. He is expected to carry on with the responsibility even after the elections, if Das Munshi does not get well by that time.         
	Federation sources said that there were some members who argued in favour of postponing the elections. Patel, however, ruled against it since there is no such provision in the constitution.         
	Six state associations have been stripped off their voting rights by the executive committee because of different reasons.         
	While Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh have internal problems, Andaman, Daman and Diu, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh have been pulled up for lack of activity at the national level.         
	The meeting also approved increments in salaries of national coach Bob Houghton and age group coach Collin Toal.         
	The second division I-League will be played early next year with only one team from Calcutta  George Telegraph  taking part in it. The application of Peerless Club has been rejected for not fulfilling the AFC licensing norms.

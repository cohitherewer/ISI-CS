                                                   Prakash, Rohan unmoved

           
	New Delhi: Prakash Amritraj and Rohan Bopanna on Tuesday stuck to their stand of not playing under Davis Cup captain Leander Paes. 
    
	I stick to my stand. It has been going on for a few years and it is not good for Indian tennis, Prakash told a television channel from the US. 
    
	Prakash was particularly unhappy with Paes for not fielding him for the singles on the opening day of the Davis Cup tie against Uzbekistan despite being fully fit. 
    
	He got some of the facts wrong. I was fit enough and had even practised, but the reasons he gave is that I was not fit. I dont know why he had to say that, Prakash said. He tends to put down the team which is not good for the players, he said. 
    
	Bopanna said the biggest problem with Paes was that he hardly ever communicated with the team. He hardly has any interaction with the players. There is hardly any communication. It is not good for the team. (PTI)

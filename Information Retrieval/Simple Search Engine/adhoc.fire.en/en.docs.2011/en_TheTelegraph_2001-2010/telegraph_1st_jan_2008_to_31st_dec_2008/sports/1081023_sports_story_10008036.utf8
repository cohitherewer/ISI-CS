The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj plans to keep it simple
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yuvraj plans to keep it simple
                      
	Cuttack: Yuvraj Singh is leaving no stone unturned to regain his form, and the elegant left-hander said the best way to achieve that is by keeping it straight and simple in the upcoming Challenger Trophy.         
	Yuvraj, ignored for the four-Test series against Australia, had a string of poor performances in Sri Lanka earlier this year, where he averaged just above 14 from five matches.         
	However, he came back strongly with a vital 113-run innings in the second essay of the four-day practice match between the Board Presidents XI and the touring Australian side in Hyderabad earlier this month.         
	My form is not so great. So I will try to keep it straight and simple. I am playing as many tournaments as possible at this level. I had a good knock at Hyderabad and I hope for a good outing here in the Challengers too, said Yuvraj who will lead the India Blue team at the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy.         
	The Punjab batsman was of the opinion that Challenger Trophy is always an elite domestic competition as it showcases the best of Indian cricketers aspiring to make it big at the international level.         
	The Challengers mean a lot not only to me but to players like Rohit (Sharma), Virat (Kohli) and (Manoj) Tiwary... Its a challenge leading India Blue which is the second best Indian team. Moreover, being the defending champions, it will be a huge responsibility, Yuvraj said after the teams practice session Wednesday.         
	The 26-year-old flamboyant batsman feels that the Challenger Trophy will help him and his other India teammates to get into the groove ahead of the seven-match ODI series against the touring England side in November-December.         
	The ODIs here will be a good preparation for us ahead of the home series against England. Also, the Challengers will give the players a good exposure, said Yuvraj. (PTI)

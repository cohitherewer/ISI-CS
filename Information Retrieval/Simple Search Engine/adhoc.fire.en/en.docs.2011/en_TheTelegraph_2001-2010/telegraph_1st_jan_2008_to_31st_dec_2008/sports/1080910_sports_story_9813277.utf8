            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Action will be aplenty in Wednesdays eight events, featuring the 1,800m Bhishma Cup, a terms race for four-year-olds and upwards. What may interest the city turfites most is the presence of about a dozen outstation jockeys who will be making the biggest ever congregation on the monsoon track. Need not to say that the competition will be fierce during the afternoon, including the main event which will witness seven of them in action.          
	Nevertheless, Rockefeller may take some beating in the Bhishma Cup. The Pesi Shroff-trainee was an easy third in his last outing when he covered miles of ground in the stretch run. Jockey J. Chinoy, who has been camping in the city for some time, will be partnering the well-bred five year-old by Razeen out of Roccobarocco.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

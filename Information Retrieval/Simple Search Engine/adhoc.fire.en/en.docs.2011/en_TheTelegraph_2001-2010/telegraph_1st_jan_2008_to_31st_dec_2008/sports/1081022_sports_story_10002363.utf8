                                                                                                                                                                                                       Series still wide open, says Sourav 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly in Mohali on Tuesday                           
	Calcutta: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly believes that the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is still wide open and a lot of excitement is in store from the remaining two Tests in the series.                   
	According to the 36-year old southpaw, who reached the city on Tuesday evening, Indias 1-0 lead will always be an advantage but Australia can bounce back.         
	The third Test is scheduled from October 29 in Delhi while the fourth is in Nagpur from November 6.         
	Its always nice to win matches against Australia, Sourav told reporters. But the series is still wide open and the Australians can at any point of time bounce back.         
	He also appreciated the Punjab Cricket Associations gesture of giving him a trophy as a memento in his final Test in Mohali.         
	Sourav was clearly upbeat after scoring his 16th century and crossing the 7,000-run mark in the Mohali Test but said there was no question of reconsidering his decision to retire.         
	I have already told you all about my decision I am not thinking anything about it We are happy that the team has won today (Tuesday) and would like to continue this performance.         
	Incidentally, Sourav announced his retirement plans just before the first Test in Bangalore.         
	The Bengal left-hander, has 7090 runs from 111 Tests with an average of 42.30 and a strike rate of 51.17.         
	Talking about his plans for the last two Tests, the former Team India captain said: I would like to take some rest for the next three days now I just want to stay positive and finish it in style.         
	Asked about the left-elbow injury he picked up during the Mohali Test, he said: Its better now.         
	Sourav stressed that Sachin Tendulkars feat of becoming the highest run-getter in Tests, surpassing Brain Lara, boosted the team, and hence the rec- ord outright win against the Aussies.         
	Sachins knock was no doubt a boost for the team. It lifted the teams spirits and help us to win the match, he said.         
	Hailing leg-spinner Amit Mishras performance as a great show, Sourav said: He (Amit) is a talented player He has done a great job and will definitely be a star performer for India in the future.

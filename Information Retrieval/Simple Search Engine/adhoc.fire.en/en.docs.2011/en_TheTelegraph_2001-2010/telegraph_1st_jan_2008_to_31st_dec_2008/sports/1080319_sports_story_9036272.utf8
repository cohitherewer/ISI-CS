The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand emerges sole   leader
                                                     Anand emerges sole   leader
          
	Nice: Viswanathan Anand jumped into sole lead of the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament after a couple of draws with former world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the third round.         
	The world champion took his overall tally to four points and is now half a point ahead of Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, Levon Aronian of Armenia, Magnus Carlsen of Norway and Topalov who all have 3.5 points each.         
	Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan are a half point behind.         
	Mamedyarov stole the show on the third day with a sensational victory over Kramnik from the black side of a rarely played Budapest Gambit in the rapid game.         
	Anand also leads the rapid section with 2.5 points, a half point clear of Aronian and Topalov. Ivanchuk, Carlsen and Russian Alexander Morozevich head the blindfold event with 2 points each.         
	In the blindfold, Topalov and Anand had a theoretical discussion in one of the main lines of the Catalan Opening where the Indian played black. Topalov had a tiny advantage but Anand defended well and the game ended in a draw after 59 moves.         
	In the rapid game Topalov, playing black, employed the Caro Kann Defence. Anand did not get much out of the opening as the Bulgarian seemed aptly prepared.         
	Two-time world junior champion Mamedyarov stole the limelight with his win over Kramnik. After the blindfold had ended in a draw, the Azerbaijani favoured the Budapest Gambit in the rapid. He used his pieces effectively to pull off the coup in 39 moves.         
	In another interesting game of the day, Aronian found his nemesis in Israeli Boris Gelfand in the rapid game.         
	 After a complicated blindfold that ended in a draw, the Armenian was out of sorts after a pawn sacrifice in a French Defence game.         
	 Gelfand proved that white did not have enough compensation after 55 moves.           (PTI)

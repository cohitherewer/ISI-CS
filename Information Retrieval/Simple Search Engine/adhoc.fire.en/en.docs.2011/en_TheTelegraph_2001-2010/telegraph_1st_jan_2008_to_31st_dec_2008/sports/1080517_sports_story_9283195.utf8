            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan with players and coach John Buchanan at the Knight Riders dugout                           
	Mumbai: At a time when Vijay Mallyas attack on his Bangalore Royal Challengers captain, Rahul Dravid, is still being viewed with shock, its interesting to note exactly how the Kolkata Knight Riders owner, Shah Rukh Khan, behaves.         
	In fact, so particular is Shah Rukh about protocol that he doesnt even enter the teams dressing room without knocking and seeking coach John Buchanans permission.         
	The dressing room is the players domain and Johns in-charge there I definitely need his okay Also, even when Im in there, I sit in a corner, Shah Rukh told The Telegraph.         
	Shah Rukh has, of course, already gone on record saying he wouldnt do a Mallya even if his team stumbles. He has also said that his association with the Knight Riders hasnt been driven by a desire to make money from cricket.         
	For the record, win or lose, the Knight Riders party. Thats the Shah Rukh way and thats why his players absolutely adore him.         
	An exception was made after Fridays disaster at the Wankhede, but not because of the result.

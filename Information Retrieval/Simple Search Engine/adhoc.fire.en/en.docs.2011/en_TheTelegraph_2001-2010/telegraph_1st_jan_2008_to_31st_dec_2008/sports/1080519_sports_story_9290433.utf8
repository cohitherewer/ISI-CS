	Bangalore: Bangalore Royal Challengers would be playing for their pride in their IPL tie versus Delhi DareDevils at the Chinnaswamy on Monday.         
	The match would be a make or break tie for the Delhi DareDevils. With 10 points from 11 matches, the Delhi team cant afford to lose any.         
	Rajasthan Royals 65-run victory over the Rahul Dravid-led side on Monday have almost handed them a semi-final berth while the DareDevils allowed Kings XI Punjab to strengthen their chances for a last-four spot.         
	The Delhi team had a rollicking start but then slumped after losing a few close matches. (PTI)

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Shabbir Ali and Bimal Ghosh sounded happy with the share of points after their teams played out a draw here at the Barasat stadium on Monday.         
	Shabbir, the Mohammedan Sporting coach, said: I know it was our home match and maybe we should have done better, but then again it was the start of the I-League campaign against a side which has always fought hard against sides from Bengal. I am happy to begin the campaign with a point.         
	Shabbir blamed the missed opportunities in the second half for the draw. Our first half was not good, but in the second period we did create quite a few opportunities which we should have taken         
	Air India coach Bimal Ghosh was expectedly happy.         
	I know it was an away tie for us and therefore a point is always good, but given the fact that we went into the lead, maybe a win would have been the perfect ending, he said.

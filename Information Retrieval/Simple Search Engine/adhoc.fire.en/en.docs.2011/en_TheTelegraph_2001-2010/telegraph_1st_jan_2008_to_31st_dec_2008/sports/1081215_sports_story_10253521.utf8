The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Real plan raid for Roman
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Real plan raid for Roman
            DUNCAN WHITE                      
	Juande Ramos, the new Real Madrid coach, is planning a raid on his former club, Tottenham Hotspur, when the transfer window opens on January 1.         
	And it is understood that Harry Redknapp, Ramoss successor as Tottenham manager, is prepared to allow Russian striker Roman Pavlyuchenko to leave to enable him to spend next month.         
	Redknapps chairman, Daniel Levy, has made it clear that there will be only limited funds available in the transfer window for Tottenham and Redknapp is understood to be in the market for a goalkeeper, a defender and a striker, with the latter becoming a priority if Roman Pavlyuchenko is sold.         
	Tottenham are reportedly ready to make a joint bid of 16 million for Robert Green and Matthew Upson, who both play for Redknapps former club West Ham. While Gianfranco Zola, the West Ham manager, has been given assurances his best players will not be sold, the financial crisis has hit their Icelandic owner, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, particularly hard, and a substantial offer will be difficult to resist at Upton Park.         
	Ramos, meanwhile, has been busy since his appointment as Real manager early last week and he has also made inquiries about Tottenhams Aaron Lennon and Didier Zokora.         
	Real have been monitoring Aston Villas in-form winger, Ashley Young, too as Ramos looks to give his new side a Premier League flavour.         
	But Pavlyuchenko has been Reals long-term target. They have been interested in signing him since March, when their chief scout watched him playing for Spartak Moscow. That interest never translated into a firm bid and he signed for Tottenham for a reported 14 million in September.         
	However, Reals leading striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy, has had knee surgery and will be missing for at least nine months, forcing Real into the market for a striker.         
	Pavlyuchenko has not had the impact that was anticipated from him at White Hart Lane and his inability to speak English has frustrated the coaching staff.         
	When he was asked about their interest, he said: If they make an offer for me, of course I will go. Theyre my favourite club in all of Europe and I only follow the Spanish La Liga so I know how they have played.

                                                    Ban unfair, say former captains

         Harbhajan Singh at the SCG on the final day 
          
	New Delhi: The three-Test ban on Harbhajan Singh evoked strong reactions from the fraternity. Everyone felt it unjustified and unfair but advised the Indian team not to call off the tour. 
    
	The off-spinner was banned on Sunday night after ICC Match Referee Mike Procter upheld the Australian charge that he had racially abused their allrounder Andrew Symonds. 
    
	The following are excerpts from what three former India captains had to say (alphabetically): 
    
	Kapil Dev: It is surprising and unfair. The Indian team is one of the most gentle teams in the world. 
    
	Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi: I think we should not forfeit the series. He (Harbhajan) requires moral support from the team, the BCCI and from the countrymen. He should appeal against the ban. 
    
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth: We should not take a drastic step (of abandoning the tour) but instead should fight hard in the next matches.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jyoti Randhawa                           
	Noida: Jyoti Randhawa dropped a shot on 16th and 17th holes to finish tied second in the SAIL Open at the Jaypee Greens on Saturday.         
	New Zealands Mark Brown emerged the comfortable winner after a steady three-under-par 69.         
	Randhawa, who shot a 71, tied for second spot with Scot Hend and South Koreas Noh Seung-Yul. Australian Hend finished at par and Seung-yul ended his campaign with a 69 for a 278 total.         
	Indias Gaganjeet Bhullar and Malaysias Danny Chia fired matching 72s and ended their run in a tie for fifth spot.         
	At one point it seemed as if Randhawa would take the game to Brown. He came as close as within one shot of the New Zealander but the bogeys on the 16th and 17th put paid to his hopes of a sixth Asian Tour win at home.         
	I was losing focus and it was patchy, off and one, said Randhawa. But I am taking this as preparation for next weeks Johnnie Walker tournament. I hope to do well there.         
	Bhullar expected challenge for the title never materialised. His roller coaster round of six birdies, four bogeys and one double saw him end at 72 and stay at nine-under for the tournament, just where he had begun.         
	Brown, who earned the top prize of $63,400 and gained full exemption till the end of the 2010 season on the Asian Tour, said, It was so emotional. I was remembering my father, who passed away four years ago. I wish he was here to see me win, said Brown.

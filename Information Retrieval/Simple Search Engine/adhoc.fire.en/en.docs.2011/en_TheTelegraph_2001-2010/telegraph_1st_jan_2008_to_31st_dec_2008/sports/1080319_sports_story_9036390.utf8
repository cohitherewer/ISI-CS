                                                   Dravid: Man who stood up for the game 
                      
	Bangalore: Paying rich tributes to late cricket coach Bob Woolmer on his first death anniversary Tuesday, former Indian captain Rahul Dravid described him as a man who stood up for the games welfare.         
	Woolmer was a man who stood up for cricket. He will always be fondly remembered by cricketers and those who love the game all over the world. However, it is sad the way it ended, said the Bangalore IPL team Royal Challengersicon.         
	On this day last year, Woolmer died under mysterious circumstances in a hotel room in Jamaica, just a few hours after the Pakistans teams unexpected elimination at the hands of Ireland in the World Cup.         
	To another question on the coming Test series against South Africa slated to begin from March 26 in Chennai, Dravid said: We will do our best.           (PTI)

	Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket chairman Arjuna Ranatunga on Monday said he would not mind sending the Sri Lankan team to Pakistan if India refuse to tour their neighbours as scheduled next month.         
	We will not hesitate to send our team to Pakistan in case we are invited, Ranatunga said.         
	Ranatunga said he was sure Pakistan would provide enough security arrangements for them.         
	Even otherwise Pakistan has proved it can provide adequate security as it did during the Asia Cup cricket tournament, he said. (PTI)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Ace striker Bhaichung Bhutia held the Indian flag high on a starry night in Munich when he rubbed shoulders with some of the worlds biggest stars in the Goal4africa charity match at the Allianz Arena on Saturday.         
	Playing alongside top players like Michael Ballack, Robin van Persie, Nelson Dida, Mark van Bommel, Gennaro Gattuso and Ze Roberto, the Indian skipper scored two fine goals but it was not enough to prevent his team, Edu, from losing 6-9 to Cation in the match organised to raise funds for childrens education in Africa.         
	Scoring goals in a charity match like this may not have much importance but I am happy that I could prove the Indians, too, can play football, said the Mohun Bagan forward from Munich after the match. It was very important to make this point, he added.         
	Bhutia, who was watched by his wife Madhuri and uncle Karma Bhutia from the stands, said it was an overwhelming experience to play with the best players in the world. It is not easy to express my feelings in words, said Bhaichung. It was an unforgettable night. It was a great experience to share the pitch with some of the best players in the world.         
	The simplicity of the top players has moved Bhaichung a lot. They were so humble and nice to everyone. After all they are the biggest stars of the game today.         
	Playing along with former Formula One legend Michael Schumacher was also a kind of different experience for Bhutia. Yes, he was eager to score a goal. It is good that he finally got one in the end, Bhaichung remarked.

	Mar del Plata: Spain won the Davis Cup for the third time, on Sunday, when Fernando Verdasco beat Jose Acasuso in five sets to give them an unassailable 3-1 lead over Argentina in the final.         
	Verdasco won 6-3, 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 as Spain, missing world No. 1 Rafael Nadal through injury, still managed to hand Argentina their third defeat in three final appearances and their first home loss for 10 years.         
	Its a dream. Ive wanted this chance since I was a boy, few get it and even fewer take it, said an elated Verdasco.         
	Verdasco, ranked 16th in the world, was brought in as a replacement for off-form David Ferrer who was crushed in straight sets by David Nalbandian on Friday.         
	Acasuso, ranked 48th, was thrown into the fray after Argentinas No. 1 Juan Martin del Potro was ruled out with a pulled muscle in his right leg which he suffered in Fridays defeat to Feliciano Lopez.         
	Verdasco won the first set after breaking in the fifth game as Acasuso struggled to find his rhythm.         
	The Argentine came to life in the second set, which he won in a tie-break after both players dropped service twice.         
	Playing some excellent tennis and backed by a passionate crowd, Acasuso took the third set and looked as if he could take the tie to a decisive rubber involving Nalbandian which would have left the hosts as favourites.         
	But Acasuso lost his nerve after Verdasco broke in the sixth game of the fourth set to level the match.         
	Acasuso then looked tired and demoralised and the Spaniard strolled through the final set to shatter the hopes of the home crowd.         
	Although Acasuso saved two match points, Verdasco finished off the match at the third attempt with a rasping forehand down the line.         
	In the Davis Cup, you have to fight to the death and you always have to keep your hope of winning. This mental strength helped me win the match, Verdasco said.         
	Spain went 2-1 ahead on Saturday when Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez beat David Nalbandian and Agustin Calleri in a fiery doubles encounter.         
	Nalbandian and Calleri took the first set before the visitors hit back for a 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 win in three hours 19 minutes to put Spain within reach of a shock win.         
	The match hinged on a dramatic third set where Spain raced to a 5-1 lead but Argentina hit back to force a tie-break.         
	The hosts then led 5-1 in the tie-break before the Spanish won six points in a row to take the set.         
	Spain coach Emilio Sanchez Vicario said his pair were more together than Calleri and Nalbandian, whose last Davis Cup match together was two years ago in the final against Russia.         
	This made the difference, he said. They were more united, they helped each other, when one was down the other picked him up. (REUTERS)

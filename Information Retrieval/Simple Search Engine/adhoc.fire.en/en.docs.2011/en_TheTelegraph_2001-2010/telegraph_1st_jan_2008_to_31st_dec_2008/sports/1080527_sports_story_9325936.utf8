The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cristiano will stay, claim United
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cristiano will stay, claim United
            MARK OGDEN             Cristiano Ronaldo                           
	David Gill, the chief executive of Manchester United insisted on Sunday that Cristiano Ronaldo will be in a Manchester United shirt the next season. The 23-year-old twice Footballer of the Year, has refused to pledge his future to United by dismissing the ever growing speculation that are linking him with a world record transfer to Real Madrid.         
	The Portuguese forward has four years remaining in his contract at Old Trafford and Gill claims the club are only interested in keeping him in the Premier League.         
	Gill said, Cristiano has a four-year contract with us. The contract goes to 2012 and there are no current discussions about reviewing that or extending it, but hopefully he will be with us beyond that.         
	We will sit down and extend it with him at some time and hopefully keep him at the club for many more years to come. Why would he want to leave at the moment with all the success he has achieved as an individual and with the team?         
	The chief executive also said, that he is part of a great unit and we believe we can do equally well next season. He wants to be part of that success.         
	You look at him around the training ground and on the pitch with the other players, he is clearly very happy here and we are confident he will be with us for years to come.         
	Gill further said that their manager Sir Alex Ferguson would be given the funds to improve his squad again this summer as United bid to defend their Premier League and European titles.         
	He said, We already started discussions with Alex and Carlos Queiroz in Moscow, but we discuss the squad throughout the season. Those discussions will now come to a finality and we will identify those players that we would like to get in and may move on.         
	One of our strengths is that we dont rest on our laurels. After winning two trophies, we will see what needs to be done for next season.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

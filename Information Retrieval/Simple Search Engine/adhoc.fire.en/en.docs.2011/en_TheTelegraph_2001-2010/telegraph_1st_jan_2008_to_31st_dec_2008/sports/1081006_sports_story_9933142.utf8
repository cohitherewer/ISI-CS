The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Im not here to make friends: Harbhajan
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Im not here to make friends: Harbhajan
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Melbourne: He claims to have learnt from his mistakes and is tired of being embroiled in controversies but Harbhajan Singh refuses to change and says he would be at his feisty best when India take on Australia in the upcoming Test series.         
	Harbhajan said he plays to win and not to make friends.         
	Obviously when I play for my country I go out there to win games, Im not here to make friends, Harbhajan told an Australian TV channel.         
	So youll expect the same sort of fighting spirit. I am very passionate about my game and I get involved in the game. I want to do everything right and I want to win each and every game for my country. Thats the way I am and thats never going to change, he added.         
	The flamboyant off-spinner, who was at the centre of an ugly race row with Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds during Indias tour here earlier this year, however, maintained that he has learnt from his mistakes.         
	We all make mistakes. With time, you learn about life and things which you regret later on, I shouldnt have done that, he said.         
	Harbhajan attributed part of his aggressive persona to being a Sikh, saying that his religion preaches its followers to be warriors and winners.         
	India lost the 2004 home series against Australia but Harbhajan feels this time, his team would be more than a handful for the world champions.         
	We have a very good side and we are probably the only team that have given them a run for their money, he said.         
	Harbhajan is also eyeing his 300th Test wicket in the first Test itself in Bangalore. The 28-year old off-spinner has 291 wickets from 69 Tests.         
	Yes I am quite eager to reach there. I am quite positive about getting there in the first Test, Harbhajan said.         
	He was all praise for Sourav Ganguly. He is a great batsman. He is very intelligent. Ive played under his captaincy... I hope he does well in the series...

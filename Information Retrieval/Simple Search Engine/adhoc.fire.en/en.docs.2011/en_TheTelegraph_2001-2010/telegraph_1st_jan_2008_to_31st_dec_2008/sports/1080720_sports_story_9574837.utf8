  - Will be a dream come true to get his wicket             Ajantha Mendis                           
	Colombo: After wrecking the famed Indian batting line-up in the Asia cup final, Sri Lankas new spin sensation Ajantha Mendis now harbours dream of scalping the prize wicket of batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar in the upcoming three-match Test series starting on Wednesday.         
	Mendis created ripples during the Asia Cup in Pakistan early this month with his carrom ball delivery, picking up 17 wickets in the continental tournament.         
	He single-handedly won the trophy for Sri Lanka by pocketing six Indian wickets in the final.         
	It will be dream come true for me to get the wicket of Tendulkar, especially when he is on the threshold of surpassing Brian Laraa world record of highest Test runs, said Mendis.         
	Tendulkar, who has 11782 runs from 147 Tests so far, is just 171 short of equalling the West Indian legends 11953 runs.         
	Mendis, a Sri Lankan army officer, said that he is pumped up to show his potential against the famous batting quartet of Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman, who were not there in Indias Asia Cup squad.         
	Laxman, Tendulkar, Dravid and Ganguly are among the best batsmen in the world and I am eagerly looking forward to bowl against them.         
	I will be happy to get the scalps of many other Indian batsmen, he said.         
	The young mystery bowler also revealed that apart from the carrom ball he has developed a new delivery to unsettle the Indians.         
	However, when asked to elaborate on his new delivery, he said, come and see for yourself in the match.         
	I will continue with the same tactics in Tests which I employed in ODIs. I dont intend to change much.         
	My bowling is a gift of god. I am also grateful to my school coach from whom I learnt immensely.         
	Asked whether he would be bowling long spells in the upcoming Test series, he said: It is up to the captain to decide whether to give me long spells or not, but if given I am prepared to bowl.         
	On he being compared in the cricketing circles with spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan, Mendis said he has still a long way to go to fill in the veterans shoes.         
	Muralidharan is my idol and it is a privilege for me to bowl alongside him. He has been advising me continuously and told me to approach him any time for suggestions.

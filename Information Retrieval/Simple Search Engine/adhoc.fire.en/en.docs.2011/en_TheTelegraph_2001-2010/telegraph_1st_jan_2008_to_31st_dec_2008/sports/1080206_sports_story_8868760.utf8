The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gerrard to lead in tie vs Switzerland
                                                  Gerrard to lead in tie vs Switzerland
  - Midfielder can transmit things and inspire players: Capello       Vicki Hodges            Fabio Capello in London Colney on Tuesday. (AP)                                 
	Fabio Capello has named Steven Gerrard as captain for Wednesdays friendly with Switzerland at Wembley.         
	The Italian coach has handed the honour to the Liverpool midfielder in the absence of John Terry but will not make a decision on his long-term appointment until after the summer.         
	Gerrard has been given the first opportunity to stake a claim for the position while Capello will run the rule over other potential candidates in the seven months leading up to the start of Englands 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign.         
	Capello said he would wait until before Englands qualifier against Andorra on September 6 to make a full-term appointment.         
	However, in naming Gerrard as his captain for his first match in charge, he said: I have done it because I think he is an important player for England, according to my plans.         
	Steven is important for all the players because he can transmit things and pass on things and inspire players.         
	Chelsea defender Terry was handed the captaincy during Steve McClarens ill-fated tenure and is currently sidelined with injury.         
	While Terry remains in with a shout of retaining the captaincy on a long-term basis, Michael Owen and Rio Ferdinand remain strong contenders for the role.         
	Capello, who spoke in Italian at Tuesdays news conference, praised the co-operation of the squad having taken his first two training sessions at Wembley where he has already taken a no-nonsense approach.         
	England players have been handed a list of dos and donts to abide by under Capellos regime but the 61-year-old denied his hardline approach was because of English footballers perceived pampered lifestyle.         
	I have not found it to be different here than anywhere else, he said.         
	I have found great co-operation here and have been impressed with the players mentality and with this we should be able to do well.         
	Capello has told players they must be punctual and is trying to build a strong bond within the squad by making them eat together while on international duty.         
	We only come together for three days and in those three days we need to create a way of working  thats why I need to set some rules, he said.         
	We all have a role to play. Everyone is worthy of respect.         
	Capello did not want to be drawn on his decision not to hand David Beckham his 100th international cap and instead preferred to concentrate on the players he had selected for the three-day meet.         
	I respect him greatly for all things we did together at Real Madrid, he said.         
	But at the moment the most important thing is talking about the players who will play on Wednesday  not the ones who are not here.         
	Shaun Wright-Phillips, the only player to sit out training on Monday as a precaution, was able to take part in training on Tuesday and will be available for selection.

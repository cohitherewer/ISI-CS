The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB make protest official 
                                                                                                                                                                                           EB make protest official 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Anjan Mitra, it seems, has stirred a hornets nest with his comments that the names of East Bengal and Mohun Bagan were communal in nature in todays context. The issue has now escalated into a full-fledged controversy, and threatens to snowball into an avalanche that could ultimately cost the Mohun Bagan secretary his chair after East Bengal formally lodged a written complaint with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Monday.         
	The Telegraph had reported on Monday that Mitras remarks were in gross violation of the Code of Ethics laid down by the AIFF.         
	When contacted, East Bengal secretary Kalyan Majumdar confirmed the move and added that the club expects the AIFF to follow the law as laid down in the Code of Ethics which Anjan Mitra has flagrantly violated with his comment on Saturday, that the names of some city clubs provided fodder to riot mongers, trouble makers and assorted hooligans to run amok whenever the teams met on the football field.         
	Yes we have filed a complaint today(Monday) with the AIFF, and will appeal that requisite punitive action be taken against Anjan Mitra, Majumdar remarked.         
	The Mohun Bagan secretarys comments had drawn flak from the Mohammedan Sporting and East Bengal authorities who felt that it was in bad taste.         
	Both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan had been mulling action against the Mohun Bagan secretary with Sultan Ahmed, the Mohammedan Sporting. secretary revealing on Sunday that they were definitely lodging their protest in writing.         
	However, there was no word on the proposed Mohammedan Sporting move till Monday evening. The club has also decided to knock on the doors of AFC and Fifa if AIFF fail to take appropriate action.         
	Mitra said he had already heard of the East Bengal step but stood firm on his earlier stand.         
	There should be no communal or class divide in football. Such things as ghoti and bangaal are anachronisms in this day and age. That was from another era. There is no reason why we should continue going to war at every derby invoking such primal loyalties. I have been misunderstood. I never called anyone communal, but it is true that so long as such rifts exist, football will continue to be marred by violence, Mitra said.         
	The AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco, when contacted in Hyderabad, said that he was yet to receive the letter from East Bengal, and therefore couldnt offer any comment on this latest development.

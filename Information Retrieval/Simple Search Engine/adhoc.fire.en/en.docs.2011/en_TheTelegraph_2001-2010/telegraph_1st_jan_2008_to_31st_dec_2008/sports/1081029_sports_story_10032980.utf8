The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia will bounce back: Gilly
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Australia will bounce back: Gilly
                      
	Melbourne: With the memory of the Mohali defeat still afresh, it would need a Herculean effort from Australia to square the four-match Test series against India, but former stumper Adam Gilchrist believes Ricky Pontings men can bounce back in the third Test that begins in New Delhi from Wednesday.         
	Theres a great challenge there, but Ive got no doubt our guys will come out fighting, Gilchrist said at the launch of his autobiography True Colours.         
	India lead the series 1-0 following their record 320-run win in Mohali but Gilchrist feels one weeks rest will help the Aussies recharge their batteries.         
	Im sure the little bit of time off that theyve had enabled them to regroup and get their direction right, so I expect them to come out hard, he told an Australian daily.         
	However, Gilchrist admitted the task at hand is pretty hard for the Australians as they will be playing at the Kotla, known to be Indias happy hunting ground.         
	Gilchrist also said he spoke to Sachin Tendulkar and cleared the air after excerpts from his autobiography, criticising the master blaster for his role in the monkeygate issue, created quite a controversy.

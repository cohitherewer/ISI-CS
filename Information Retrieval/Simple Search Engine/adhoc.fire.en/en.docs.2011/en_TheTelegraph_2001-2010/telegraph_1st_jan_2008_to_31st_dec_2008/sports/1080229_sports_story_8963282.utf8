The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Job fatigue too much for King
                                                     Job fatigue too much for King
  - Outgoing Team India trainer to marry Calcutta-based Kimberlene       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Greg King                                 
	Sydney: Outgoing physio John Gloster isnt the only one getting married soon after Team India returns home. In the same boat is trainer Greg King, who too is ending his innings with the Sachin Tendulkars.         
	While Gloster is marrying a Mumbai-based pilot, King is engaged to Calcuttas Kimberlene Dragwidge, who is a flight attendant with Jet Airways.         
	We first met on a Calcutta-Guwahati flight before the start of the ODIs against Pakistan (in early November last year) and I proposed not much later Yes, you could call it a whirlwind romance, King, who usually keeps a very low profile, told The Telegraph.         
	The marriage is in Calcutta on April 19, a day after the headline-making Indian Premier League gets under way.         
	King will be associated with the Chennai team and has sought its permission to join a couple of weeks late.         
	Marriage isnt the No.1 reason why King has chosen to quit the Team India job. The biggest is that I havent had a real break from the time Ive joined (August 2003) Ive hardly seen my parents, who live in Johannesburg, in the past four-and-a-half years The job fatigue has been too much, he pointed out.         
	King added: I dont know who will succeed either John or me, but the Board should have a rotation system, one that will allow the trainer and the physio to have reasonable breaks Frankly, within a fortnight of landing in Australia, Id realised I just couldnt continue Today, Im only looking forward to this tour ending.         
	Well, weve had burn outs involving sportspersons, but trainers arent immune either.

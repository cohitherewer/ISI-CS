                                                                                                                                                                                                     Saurashtra sets up date with Bengal
                      
	Visakhapatnam: Saurashtra stormed into the final of the National One-dayers after twin half-centuries from Chirag Pathak (58) and Shitanshu Kotak (53 not out) powered them to a five-wicket win over Vidarbha in the second semi-final on Tues- day.         
	They will now meet Bengal in Thursdays final. This will be Saurashtras maiden appearance in the title clash of this tournament.         
	Opting to bat first, Vida-rbha fell short in the very first over losing opener Faiz Fazal.         
	Though Amit Paunikar and Ravi Jangid had a nice 51-run partnership Vidarbha were pushed on back-foot after a good fightback from Saurashtra bowlers brought them back into the game.         
	Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja struck three vital blows to Vidarbha claim- ing three for 49 in his 10 overs.         
	In reply, Saurashtra overwhelmed the target in 47.3 overs with valuable contr- ibutions from Chirag, Shitanshu and Pratik Mehta (33).                       (AGENCIES)

	Linares: World champion Viswanathan Anand drew with his nearest rival Magnus Carlsen of Norway to maintain his slender lead at the end of the 10th round of the Morelia-Linares tournament.         
	Anand took his tally to 6.5 points to be half-a-point ahead of the Norwegian teenager while draw was the order of the day as none of the four games produced a decisive result.         
	GM Levon Aronian of Armenia remained in the third place with a draw against Teimour RadjabovAnand decided to play solidly against Carlsen and chose a positional line against the Sveshnikov variation of the Sicilian defence. Carlsen managed to generate the kind of play which is characteristic of the variation and a level position arose from the opening.         
	With neither player seeing a way to gain the upper hand, a draw was agreed to on the 22nd move.

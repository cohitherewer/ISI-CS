The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB moves court on Shoaib issue
                                                                                                                                                                                                     PCB moves court on Shoaib issue
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has sought advice from the Lahore High Court on whether it can allow controversial speedster Shoaib Akhtar to play in the domestic Twenty20 tournament even if he delays the payment of a fine of Rs 7 million.         
	The PCB legal counsel confirmed they have submitted an application to the Lahore High Court, which will hear a writ petition filed by Shoaib against his 18-months ban and fine imposed on him by an appellate tribunal of the Board.         
	Tafazzul Rizvi said the Board had asked him to get court advice on the payment of fine as the legal notice sent to Shoaib clearly states that he cant play for Pakistan and anywhere in Pakistan without first paying the fine.         
	We will act now after getting advice from the court, Rizvi said.         
	The fast bowler had a five-year ban imposed on him by the PCBs disciplinary committee reduced to 18 months by the appellate tribunal in June.         
	But the tribunal while reducing the ban, asked him to pay up the fine.         
	Shoaib has filed a writ petition in the Lahore High Court against the ban and fine but the court while suspending the ban has given no order on the payment of fine.           (PTI)

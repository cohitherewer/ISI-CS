                                                                                                                                                                                           AIFF defers I-League
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian Football Association (IFA) officials heaved a sigh of relief on Friday when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) agreed to their request of deferring the start of the I-League by 14 days. The fixtures will, however, be released by the AIFF next week.         
	The second edition of the I-League, which was supposed to start from September 12, will now begin on September 26. It will allow the IFA to complete the ongoing Sahara CFL Premier Division.         
	In the meeting of the I-League clubs with the AIFF at the Football House, federation secretary Alberto Colaco expressed his desire to start the league with the match between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in Calcutta, but both the city majors objected to the proposal.         
	Colaco explained that the sponsors wanted to start the league campaign with a crowd-pulling tie, but the Calcutta teams did not agree. The AIFF secretary, however, said he reserves the right to decide the fixtures.         
	According to a club official, Mohun Bagan objected to the AIFFs decision of not allowing the I-League matches to be held at their club ground. The Mohun Bagan official alleged that the venue inspection team submitted an adverse report without even bothering to consult the club officials on the facilities available at the club ground.         
	Selection of venues turned out to be the bone of contention when Colaco informed that Cooperage in Mumbai has been rejected as the I-League venue. It invited strong resentment from the Western Indian Football Association (WIFA) representative, who threatened to withdraw all Mumbai teams from the competition.         
	After a heated exchange, it was decided that the inspection team will visit Cooperage once again. For the first two rounds, all Mumbai teams will play away matches.  
	Major decisions  I-League starts from September 26. The matches in Calcutta will be played at the Salt Lake Stadium.  No matches in Cooperage for the first two rounds. Efforts are on to get D.Y. Patil Stadium and a ground in Kolhapur.  Federation Cup final rounds in Delhi and Gurgaon from December 4-22.  Prize money of the I-League will be decided later. Clubs said top five teams, instead of three, should receive prize money.  Clubs asked AIFF to make the provision to replace at least one foreigner during the league. Churchill Brothers said each team should be allowed to recruit four foreign players.  Mohun Bagan and Sporting Clube de Goa objected to AIFF rsquo;s decision of granting Rs 50 lakh to Mohammedan Sporting. The clubs demanded similar treatment.

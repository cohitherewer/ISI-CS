                                                                                                                                                                                                     Watson to replace Hayden
            A STAFF REPOPRTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket Australias national selection panel on Wednesday announced Shane Watson as the replacement for injured Matthew Hayden in the Australia ODI squad for the five-match series against the West Indies.         
	According to a Cricket Australia release on Wednesday, the chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said Watsons domestic performance and fine knock in the Indian Premier League (IPL) deserved to be rewarded.         
	Watson in the in the recently concluded IPL emerged as the player of the tournament scoring 472 runs and bagging 17 wickets for the Rajasthan Royals.         
	Hilditch said the 26-year-old Queenslands allrounder would be an exciting replacement for Hayden, who will return home with an Achilles tendon injury, in the ODI series to be held from June 24 at St Vincent.         
	Shane has had a disappointing run with injuries but finished our interstate season well and has sustained his fitness levels throughout the IPL. He is an exciting young player and deserves his opportunity to return to the Australian side, Hilditch said in a statement.

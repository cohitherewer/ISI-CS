The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjun Atwal makes cut 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Arjun Atwal makes cut 
                      
	Bridgeport: Two late birdies helped Arjun Atwal return from the brink of disaster to squeeze himself just inside the cut line with a see-saw round of 73 in the $1 million Nationwide Tour Players Cup here.         
	Atwal had an erratic front nine, which got off to an ominous bogey-bogey start, and by the time he was halfway through his round, the Orlando-based Indian was two-over.         
	Things looked even worse when he sandwiched the 12th hole birdie between bogeys, which left the Indian at a precarious three-over for the day.           (PTI)

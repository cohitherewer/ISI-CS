The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | You have to take risks: Randhawa
                                                You have to take risks: Randhawa
                      
	New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa, perched atop the Indian Masters leaderboard after the opening round, is relieved that his aggression has paid off.         
	On a course which traditionally puts a premium on accuracy and rewards players who are precise, Randhawa showed unbridled aggression. Surprisingly, he was rewarded with a blemish-free round of seven-under 65 that included three birdies and a couple of eagles.         
	 Randhawa said this was a risk he could not help taking, considering the depth of the field and magnitude of the event.         
	This is a European Tour event where people shoot really low scores. I know that you cant shoot a seven-under, be happy about it and sit on it. So whenever I get a chance, Im going to get aggressive, said the lanky golfer.         
	Im not saying that the Asian Tour or the Indian Tour is any less. But there you can get away with not making as many birdies. But when you get on the European Tour, you have to make a lot of birdies. So you have to be aggressive and take risks. I took the risk today and got the reward too.         
	As the level of the game goes higher, you have to take more risk, he said.         
	Randhawa took the cue from Mark Meara and Adam Groom before firing his first eagle on the 14th hole.         
	With the new bunkers, it becomes a narrow hole and you cant really hit the driver because if you hit a little right, its going to go in the bush. I saw Mark and Adam hit the ball to the right and thought it would be better to lay up short.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev slips; Randhawa, Gangjee miss cut
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev slips; Randhawa, Gangjee miss cut
                      
	Shanghai: Jeev Milkha Singh dropped back in the title race and tumbled down to tied 16th after a slipshod second round of four-over 76 in the BMW Asia Open here on Friday.         
	Even though Jeev, S.S.P. Chowrasia, Digvijay Singh and Shiv Kapur hung around for the weekend action, compatriots Jyoti Randhawa, Rahil Gangjee and Gaurav Ghei failed to make the cut in the $ 2.3 million event sanctioned by the Asian Tour, European Tour and China Golf Association.         
	Hollands Robert-Jan Dersken (139) made light work of tough conditions at Tomson Shanghai Pudong Golf Club, shooting a three-under 69 for the lead where he was joined by Chinas Liang-Wei Zhang (69).         
	At tied 29th was Indian Masters winner Chowrasia (145), who did well to bring in a card of 73 after three bogeys and a double bogey threatened to derail his campaign.         
	Digvijay Singhs (146) level-par round of 72 was the best by an Indian today and he was joined by Shiv Kapur at tied 39th. Overnight 14th, Shiv went three-over 75 in a round that included three birdies and six bogeys.         
	An identical round of 75 dashed Calcutta pro Rahil Gangjees (148) hopes of staying back for the final two rounds. Joining him just outside the cut-line was veteran Gaurav Ghei who carded his second successive round of 74.         
	After his opening round misadventure of 75, Randhawa, the countrys highest ranked golfer, needed a sub-par card to stay in contention but the seasoned campaigner managed 73 to miss the cut by just one shot.         
	Amandeep Johl (152) needed a miracle to make the cut which didnt happen and he crashed out after a second round of two-over 74.         
	Australian legend Greg Norman carded 73 to lie in tied 16th place. (PTI)

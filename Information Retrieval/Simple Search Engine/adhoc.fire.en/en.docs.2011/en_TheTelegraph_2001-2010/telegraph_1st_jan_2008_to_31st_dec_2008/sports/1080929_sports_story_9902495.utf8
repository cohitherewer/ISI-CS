The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Air India up against Md.Sp. strike force
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Air India up against Md.Sp. strike force
    - I-League barasat turf may turn out to be the deciding factor           A STAFF REPORTER            Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali with Theodore Sunday during practice on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting, who chased eventual champions Mohun Bagan down to the wire in the Sahara Calcutta Football League, will play their I-League opener against Mumbai-based Air India on Monday at the Barasat stadium.         
	On the eve of the match, concerns about the field conditions of the quaint little stadium at Barasat were on the minds of the two coaches.         
	Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali said: It was really shocking to see the turf come apart within the first quarter of the first match between East Bengal and United SC And we all saw the conditions in yesterdays match (Mohun Bagan against Mumbai FC).         
	While Shabbir Ali felt that it was not a wise decision to allow teams to practise at the Barasat stadium days before the I-League kicked off, Air India coach Bimal Ghosh said conditions are unlikely to affect his sides performance. We played most of our pre-season games on similar grounds in the Mumbai monsoon. So this is not new to the boys.         
	Both sides will also bank heavily on their foreign recruits. After the CFL success, Mohammedan Sportings striking pair of Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday is no longer an unknown force for opposition defenders. The urban legend of Mike Okoro skipping the pre-match practice continued as he sat on the sidelines during Sundays practice session.         
	Sunday, still nursing an injury, joined in late. Asked about his fitness, Sunday said: On a scale of 10, I would give myself a two right now. But its a big match tomorrow (Monday) and if the coach wants me to play, I shall give my best. Shabbir, though, hinted that Sunday will start.         
	Mohammedan Sportings third foreigner, Adewusi Adebayo (slated to start in the central midfield), is very much the unknown element, not having played in the CFL for the black-and-white brigade. Adebayo, though, has trained with the side for a considerable period and he should have no problems in gelling with the squad.         
	With Sheikh Azim unavailable, Shabbir will have to choose his central defenders from Bijoy Das, Prem Kumar, Gurpreet Singh and Shubhas Mondal. Jyoti Kumar and Lalchhuan Awma are likely to partner Adebayo in the middle third.         
	Air India have often held bigger teams in the past, and under Ghosh, they would be looking to live up to that reputation. The men to watch out for would be Udofia Chiukwama, the Nigerian central defender, Ghanaian Michael Payo, who will be marshalling the midfield, and the experienced Bashire Abbas upfront.         
	Ghosh would also expect local boys like Bijay Basfore, Jamir Ali Mondal and Gouranga Biswas to step up and deliver.         
	All said and done, its likely to be a showdown between Mohammedan Sportings strike force and Air Indias defence. Chiukwama will have to be on high alert with Sunday and Okoro ready to pounce on any opportunity.

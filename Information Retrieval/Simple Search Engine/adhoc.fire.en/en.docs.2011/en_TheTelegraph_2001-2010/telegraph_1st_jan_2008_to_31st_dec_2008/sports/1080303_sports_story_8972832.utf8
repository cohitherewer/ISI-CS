                                                   Sourav to open vs Orissa today
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Guwahati: Concerns over Sourav Gangulys security has forced Mondays match between favourites Bengal and Orissa in the East Zone National One-dayers to be held at the Nehru Stadium.         
	Orissa wanted to play at the NF Railway stadium, as originally scheduled, while the Bengal team management left it to the organisers. The Assam Cricket Association shifted the venue after talking to security agencies.         
	Sourav arrived here late on Sunday evening. While Bengal are almost through to the knockout stage, Orissa must win to stay afloat.         
	Sourav said on arrival that he would open the innings and that he was not thinking of making a comeback to the national one-day side.         
	He also said it was not a revenge match against Orissa, who had defeated Bengal in the Ranji Trophy. Every match is important. And I have come to give my 100 per cent to my team, he said.         
	Bengal are in high spirits having won their first two matches with bonus points against defending champions Assam and Tripura.         
	The Bengal top-order made mincemeat of the bowling of Assam and Tripura and the addition of Sourav will lend further firepower to their batting against the likes of Debashish Mohanty and Santosh Jena.         
	Nehru Stadium has been a lucky ground for Sourav, who returned to the national team after a century against North Zone on November 6, 2006 after being in the wilderness for a year.         
	He also hit a critical 39 to help India win the first one-dayer of the five-match series here against Pakistan on November 5, 2007. Out of the national one-day team, he would once again try to draw the attention of the selectors in the two matches.

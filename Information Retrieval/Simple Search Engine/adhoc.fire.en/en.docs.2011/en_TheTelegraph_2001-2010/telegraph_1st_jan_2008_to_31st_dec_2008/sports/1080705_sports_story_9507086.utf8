                  Prasad                     
	Karachi: Bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad was all praise for Team India bowlers on Friday.         
	The following are excerpts:         
	On the changes needed         
	The bowlers must be congratulated for coping with the humid weather. I see them really sweating it out. They have done a pretty good job on absolute flat tracks that have no pace, bounce or turn. We have identified some areas to work on. But the ease with which 300 odd runs are being chased with 4/5 over to spare shows nature of the wicket... But the effort and intensity shown by them at practice despite the back of to back matches is commendable.         
	The lack of experience         
	Its true that they lack the experience, but thats how it is. One gains experience as they go along. Lots of processes have been put in place and they are learning very quickly. We saw them do well in the series in Australia and England and ICC World T20 in South Africa. They have shown the eagerness to learn.         
	On the value of having variety in the attack         
	Its very important, irrespective of the conditions. If a bowler is bowling the same stuff ball after ball, its easy for the batsman to adjust. You need variation in pace and length. It is all about the mind. One has to analyse the pitch, weather and the batsman. I developed the slower one later on. Necessity is the mother of all invention. These guys have been trying. Look at Ishant, he is bowling the slower one with great effect.         
	His message to the bowlers         
	Its not exactly telling... Its a two way communication. Gary Kirsten, Paddy Upton have been chipping in by asking them the question on what their strength and weaknesses are. Our job is to facilitate decision making.         
	On Irfan Pathan         
	Injury is part and parcel of the game. Irfan is very hard working, thinks positive and has an amazing attitude. A good example of what he is capable is the Perth Test. He was playing after a long time and won us the match.         
	The bowling unit:         
	We have got good bench strength. Going back to the Australian series, Zaheer missed the series after first Test. RP stepped in with a four wicket haul in Sydney. When he got injured, Irfan and Ishant took over. This group believes in itself.         
	The mental part         
	Its about pressure and how you can handle is important. Its about how a bowler comes back after being taken for back to back boundaries. It has nothing to do with skill but about how strong one is mentally.           A CORRESPONDENT

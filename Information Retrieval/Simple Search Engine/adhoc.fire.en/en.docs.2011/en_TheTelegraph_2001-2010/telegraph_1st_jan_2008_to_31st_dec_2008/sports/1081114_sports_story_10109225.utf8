            Pakistan win with a ball to spare
    Abu Dhabi: Kamran Akmal took Pakistan to a four-wicket win over the West Indies with one ball to spare in the first ODI on Wednesday (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 
    Akmal smashed pacer Jerome Taylor for successive sixes and took a three off a mis-field to settle the issue as Pakistan overhauled their target of 294.
    Chris Gayle hit 113, his 17th ODI hundred, in a total of 294 for nine but it was overshadowed as allrounder Fawad Alam (26) and wicketkeeper Akmal (24), who came together with 33 required from 17 balls, got Pakistan home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fruitless tie for Mumbai
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fruitless tie for Mumbai
                      
	Bangalore: Chennai Super Kings win on Tuesday has put Mumbai Indians out of contention for a semi-final slot.         
	They take on Royal Challengers Bangalore in what has turned out to be an inconsequential tie for both teams. It will be a matter of pride and the Mumbai outfit would be aiming to get over their last-over blues that has seen the team lose their past three matches.         
	While coach Lalchand Rajput has blamed it on luck, skipper Sachin Tendulkar is still baffled as to what the team need to do to avoid snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.         
	The Royal Challengers, in contrast, have been rejuvenated by a win over Chennai in their previous match and Rahul Dravids men would aim to end what has been a disappointing tournament for them, on a high.

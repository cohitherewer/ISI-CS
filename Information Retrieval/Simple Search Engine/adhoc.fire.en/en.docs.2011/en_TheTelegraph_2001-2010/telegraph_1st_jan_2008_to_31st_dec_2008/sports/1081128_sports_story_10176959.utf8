	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is struggling to set fresh dates for the Federation Cup in Calcutta after the Indian Football Association (IFA) informed it about the non-availability of the Salt Lake Stadium from December 11 to 17.         
	According sources, the tournament, which was supposed to be played from December 4, may now be deferred for at least three days.         
	The Federation Cup may now start on December 7 but we are not sure about it, said an AIFF official. We may play the tournament only at Barasat till December 17, he said.         
	The IFA has informed the federation that the Salt Lake Stadium wont be available for the Federation Cup for a week from December 11. The AIFF has also cancelled two of the I-League matches scheduled in Mumbai on November 29 and 30.

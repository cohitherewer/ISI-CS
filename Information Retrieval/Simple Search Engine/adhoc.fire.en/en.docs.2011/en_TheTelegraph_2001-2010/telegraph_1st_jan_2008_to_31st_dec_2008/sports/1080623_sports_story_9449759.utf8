                                                                                                                                                                                           Spin duo in Pak squad
                      
	Karachi: The national selection committee on Sunday named two specialist spinners and included young wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed in place of Kamran Akmal in the 15-member Pakistan squad for the Asia Cup starting on Tuesday.         
	The selectors went for 30-year-old off-spinner Saeed Ajmal and young leggie Mansoor Amjad, who played a Twenty20 International against Bangladesh earlier this year at home.         
	While Ajmal has done well in domestic cricket, Mansoor is an exciting fielder and a capable batsman and is known more as an allrounder.         
	The selectors also picked four pacers led by Umar Gul and Sohail Tanvir.         
	The selectors also included allrounder Fawad Alam providing Pakistan a four-pronged spin attack with captain Shoaib Malik also a handy option.         
	THE SQUAD         
	Shoaib Malik (captain), Misbah-ul Haq (vice captain), Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf, Shahid Afridi, Fawad Alam, Sohail Tanvir, Sarfraz Ahmed, Rao Iftikhar, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Mansoor Amjad.

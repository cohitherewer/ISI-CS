The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Didnt do a lot wrong: Paes
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Didnt do a lot wrong: Paes
  - Dont think we played badly: Bhupathi       OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Beijing: It was heartbreak for India again. After raising a lot of expectations and showing exceptional form in the first two rounds, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi went down 2-6, 4-6 to Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarter finals on Friday.         
	At a news conference following the loss, the Indian duo spoke at length on the game and their future:               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Q A heartbreak?         
	A PAES: Sure it was. Weve played together for so long and an Olympic medal is the only thing missing in our showcase. We came close to it, had some half chances too, but in the end we could not do it. You probably cant do much when you have the best player in the world on the other side of the net and with him a player who does not miss anything!         
	BHUPATHI: Obviously we are disappointed. We didnt go further and thats the bottomline. We came in as prepared as we could possibly be. We played high quality tennis in the last two matches. Today, too, I dont think we played badly. Too bad that we couldnt do it, that too on our Independence Day.         
	Do you think youll be back for the next Olympics?         
	PAES: Why not? I would be 39 by then but you already have 40-plus players around. Im in fact looking forward to the 2010 Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games in the same year. It all would depend on keeping the body fit. If my enthusiasm does not wane and I continue playing quality tennis Why not?         
	BHUPATHI: To be honest, four years is a long time and Im not sure about the next year itself. But yes, if Im among the top 10-15 players then why not? But again, 2012 is a long way off. We have played together for 13 years. Whenever required, we have always put our best foot forward. Though we could not win an Olympic medal, we have always delivered. This is something we take pride in. If both of us remain healthy, we will try to win the Commonwealth gold.         
	Were you surprised the way Federer and Wawrinka came out all guns blazing?         
	PAES: I wasnt surprised with the way Federer came out. He had a tough loss in singles. The way he came out last evening  granted it was 12:20 in the morning, granted the conditions are the same for everybody  but just with the concentration that he came out showed that they had already planned their strategy. It seemed like they had spoken to somebody who knew how to play us.         
	I really didnt feel like I had much of a chance on the returns because they were serving so well. We had one half chance where we had 15-30, and next thing, Wawrinka plays an unbelievable volley. Federer was hitting half volleys past us at the net, one forehand shot cross-court, one backhand up the line. He proved why he is among the all time greats.         
	What was different about the match against them in Athens? (where Paes-Bhupathi had beaten Federer and Yves Allegro)?         
	PAES: For one, the conditions were different. It was a bit slower maybe. I also think that in that match their strategy wasnt quite as spot on as it was this time. They didnt serve as many first serves in. We managed to get on top of them. A different match, different situation. You cant compare the two really.         
	Did you get the impression Federer was actually enjoying himself?         
	PAES: (Smiling) A little too much perhaps. I mean, when you have a guy hitting half volleys past you  and Im not that slow at the net  all you feel is that you just got to hang in. Thats what we were trying to do, we were just trying to hang in and hoping to get that second set to a tie-break and hoping that Wawrinka cracks. But that didnt happen.         
	Is there anything you could have done differently in this match?         
	PAES: Thats what Ive been trying to figure for the last half an hour. I dont see a damn thing. You can say what you want, but at the end of the day it is ones karma, the way it is played out. The conditions are the same for everybody. Weve tried to overcome a tough loss in Athens (where Paes-Bhupathi lost in a marathon bronze medal play-off match to Croatians Mario Ancic amp; Ivan Ljubicic 6-7, 6-4, 14-16). But we got stuck with Roger just playing unbelievable tennis.         
	We didnt see much of the famous Paes-Bhupathi chemistry at work on court?         
	BHUPATHI: Its too bad, because we felt the chemistry. Weve been feeling it since we arrived in Beijing. If you guys couldnt see it, thats really, you know, too bad.

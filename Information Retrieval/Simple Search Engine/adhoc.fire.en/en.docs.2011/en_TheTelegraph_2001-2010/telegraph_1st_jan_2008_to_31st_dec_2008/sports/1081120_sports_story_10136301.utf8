The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sporting escape with draw vs Mahindra
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sporting escape with draw vs Mahindra
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United were once again let down by a toothless attack as an off-colour Sporting Clube de Goa escaped with a goalless draw in a ninth round clash of the I-League football at the Cooperage here on Wednesday.         
	Sporting hardly looked the league leaders as their midfield failed to create enough chances, Mahindra were guilty of muffing the opportunities that came their way.         
	The hosts recovered from a slow start to dominate proceedings, especially in the second half when the visitors had only two shots  that too from long range  on the goal.         
	In the 60th minute, N.P. Pradeep came up with a weak header from an awkward height after a cross from captain Steven Dias, but Sporting keeper Felix DSouza had no problem in stopping the ball.         
	Mahindras best chance came 10 minutes later when DSouza was caught out of position and Ivory Coast striker Djidjia Douhou Pierre, out-manoeuvring the custodian, very nearly found the net but his right-footer was blocked by Samananda Singh.         
	There was an appeal for hand ball as the ball seemingly struck the defenders arm but the referee refused to intervene.         
	That was as close as Mahindra came to scoring in whole of the match.         
	Mahindra coach Derek Pereira admitted that the lack of goals might be beginning to affect the teams overall performance.         
	When goals dont come coming, there will be pressure, Pereira said, referring mainly to his Nigerian forward Chidi Edeh.         
	We are happy with one point. We tried to attack in the first half and were content to defend in the second, said Sporting coach Vishwas Gaonkar.         
	His comments were in contrast to what he had said on the eve of the match  that his players were always going for maximum points and that was why his team had not drawn a single game until now.

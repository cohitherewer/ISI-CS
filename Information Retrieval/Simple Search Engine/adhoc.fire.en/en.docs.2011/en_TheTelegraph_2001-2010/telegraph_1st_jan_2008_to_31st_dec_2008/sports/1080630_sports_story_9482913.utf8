The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lawson, media walk out on each other
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lawson, media walk out on each other
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Geoff Lawson                           
	Karachi: An unseemly exchange between Pakistans coach Geoff Lawson and the Pakistani media, after Sundays defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka, led to unprecedented walk-outs.         
	The Australian started it all by laying down the rules for the media conference: That statements shouldnt be made and that a question must not be asked twice. Also, that the questions had to be sensible.         
	If that was bizarre, what followed was even more so.         
	One of the senior Pakistani journalists countered by asking whether the coach would dictate to the media. Lawson began to leave, but changed his mind. It was too late. This time, the journalists said they were walking out.         
	They did.         
	There was near pandemonium for the next minute or so, with Lawson being booed within earshot.         
	The coachs relations with the media have been strained from the start of his tenure, just under a year ago. In contrast, predecessor Bob Woolmer was on fairly good terms with most in the Fourth Estate.         
	The 64-run defeat has almost knocked Pakistan out of the Asia Cup and calls for heads to roll will gather momentum.         
	Former captain Waqar Younis told The Telegraph: I cant understand how Shoaib Malik could decide to field on a batting track... What was the coach doing? What, indeed, had been the strategy?         
	Now, many more will be asking such questions and the demand for a Pakistani as coach could get much louder.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are almost certain to have their Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto back in the side as they face JCT in their eighth round I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	Barretos comeback after a brief injury lay off will definitely be a boost to the city giants who in their last two matches have beaten defending champions Dempo SC and runners-up Churchill Brothers.         
	According to Barreto Bagans 1-0 win over Dempo was the real turning point.         
	That was the real turning point for us That set the ball rolling for us We want to carry it on, Barreto said.         
	Bagans Moroccan coach Karim Bencharifa echoed Barretos thoughts and said. I also feel the same. That match turned things around.         
	But for tomorrows match, winning is the only thing that is on our minds. We just have to keep ourselves motivated.         
	Meanwhile, United SC are expected to have a tough time as Dempo will be going all out to garner full points when they meet on Sunday at the Nehru Stadium in Margao.         
	United SC coach Subrata Bhattacharjees first aim is to save his team from relegation. Looking at the present situation, we cannot afford to lose. We have to blame ourselves for wasting a handful of chances against JCT and Churchill in our earlier matches, he said.

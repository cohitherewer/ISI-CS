The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer takes on Ricky
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Zaheer takes on Ricky
                      
	New Delhi: With just a fortnight to go for the first Test, Indian pace spearhead Zaheer Khan on Thursday fired his first verbal volley, saying Australian captain Ricky Ponting was under pressure and that it would work to Indias advantage in the four-match series beginning October 9.         
	Pontings poor record is an advantage for us, this could be his last series as captain. If you see his statements in the press (on Australia being underdogs) you can make out he is under pressure. It works to our advantage, Zaheer said.         
	Asked about Australia relying on pace while India banks on spinners, Zaheer said the team would play to its strengths.         
	Its good to play against the worlds best. We are playing to our strengths, we are not bothered about what they are doing. We are looking to get some good match practice and this Irani Trophy has definitely helped us, he said.         
	Having struggled with form and fitness, Zaheer said he was motivated and ready for the challenge. I am prepared for the Australia series. Irani Trophy will definitely help me get into that match fitness mode, he said.

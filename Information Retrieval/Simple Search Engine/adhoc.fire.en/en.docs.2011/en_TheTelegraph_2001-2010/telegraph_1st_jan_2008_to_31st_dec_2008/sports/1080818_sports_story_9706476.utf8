	ICC decision on venue tomorrow  Karachi: Pakistan will know on Tuesday whether they will be hosting the Champions Trophy next month as International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Haroon Lorgat began his task to convince England and South African teams that it is safe to play in Pakistan. Lorgat was in Edinburg on Sunday with other ICC officials to meet English cricket officials and players to brief them on the security arrangements being put in place by Pakistan for the tournament.  Lorgat is expected to address a press conference at Lord rsquo;s after meetings with South African officials and players as well in which he will probably announce whether the tournament will stay in Pakistan or not.  ldquo;These are the final efforts being made by the ICC to convince the teams who are not happy with the security situation in Pakistan that everything is in order in Pakistan, rdquo; said a PCB source.  Meanwhile, an ICC delegation is reaching Lahore Monday on a week-long visit to look into marketing and media issues.    
	 Christie rsquo;s no  New Delhi: Linford Christie, the only British athlete to win 100-metre race gold medals in Olympics, feels that including cricket in the Olympics could be detrimental to other disciplines.  Christie fears the sport would ldquo;hamper rdquo; prospects of individual disciplines which wait for the Games to showcase their talents to the world.  ldquo;Team sports like cricket should not be included in the Olympics. Olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself, rdquo; the 48-year-old 100 metre champion said.    
	 Revelation  London: Former England batsman Marcus Trescothick on Sunday revealed how he plunged into a state of depression as his international career fell apart.  The 32-year-old Somerset opener rsquo;s dramatic decision to fly home from India and quit just before facing Australia in 2006 because of a ldquo;stress related illness rdquo; sparked speculation about the state of his mind.     
	Don rsquo;s letters   Melbourne: Himself a nightmare for premier bowlers of his time, Don Bradman wanted to give a fair deal to bowlers by giving batsmen lbw out for deliveries that pitch outside off and leg stump, provided they don rsquo;t offer a shot, according to his private letters discovered recently.

Bindra, a veteran cricket administrator, was on Sunday unanimously re-elected president of the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) at the annual general meeting of the cricket body held here.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Tatenda Taibu said he was prepared to play only as a batsman if coach John Buchanan so desired.         
	If the coach wants me in a situation where I am not keeping wickets and picks me as a batsman, I am ready for the challenge I have been doing well as a batsman, the Zimbabwean said on Sunday.         
	Kolkata Knight Riders have two other wicketkeepers in the side besides Taibu  New Zealands Brendon McCullum and Bengals Wriddhiman Saha.         
	He said the players were not reading much into Shoaib Akhtars absence. All the guys are looking forward to the matches We are waiting for the challenge.         
	On Zimbabwe cricket, he said that there was not much difference in the players approach. You cant buy experience. The guys are young and talented Once they gain experience they will perform better.

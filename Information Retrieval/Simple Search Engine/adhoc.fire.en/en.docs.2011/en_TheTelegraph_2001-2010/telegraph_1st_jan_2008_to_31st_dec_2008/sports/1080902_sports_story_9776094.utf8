The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoffs performance thrills Kevin Pietersen
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Flintoffs performance thrills Kevin Pietersen
    - Allrounder is playing some of the best cricket he has ever played, says captain             SIMON BRIGGS            Andrew Flintoff has been in superb form since his comeback                                 
	England captain Kevin Pietersen saluted Andrew Flintoff, who was named Man of the Match for the first time since his comeback, for his stunning all-round performance at Lords.         
	Andrew is playing some of the best cricket he has ever played, Pietersen said.         
	Flintoff took three for 21 in his seven overs  easily the best bowling figures of the day  before pulverising the South African bowlers by hitting an extraordinary unbeaten 31 from just 12 balls. Brief as it was, this has to be considered one of the most spectacular displays by any England player.         
	Flintoff was typically modest after the game, trying to deflect the accolades to the batsmen higher up the order. I came in and did what I did and probably took the glory, but the work had been done already. The partnership that Kevin built with Owais Shah gave me the chance to have a bit of a dash. I have played with Owais since I was 14 and he has always been a special player.         
	Flintoff admitted that he had warmed up a little gingerly on Sunday after suffering a back spasm in the morning. These hotel beds are very soft, he said. I spent 11 hours in mine last night, which was far too long. But it was nothing serious.         
	When it was suggested that he might have considered skipping what was effectively a dead rubber on fitness grounds, he looked surprised. When youre playing for England at Lords theres no such thing as a dead game.         
	Flintoff has been out of the game for a long time, and this has clearly given him a raging appetite for success. Early on this season, he seemed almost overburdened by his own expectations, scoring four ducks for Lancashire. But the taste of international cricket has clearly got his juices flowing.         
	Its been a stark contrast, he said. Playing for Lancashire, I looked around and all I could see was fielders. I didnt know where I was going to score a run. But just by playing more and more you find a rhythm and tempo of batting.         
	When Kevin asked me to bat at No. 5 I was over the moon. Statistically I have had my best results there. You have the chance to look at the bowling and get in before the last 10 or 15 overs. At the moment its working but I have to keep at it.

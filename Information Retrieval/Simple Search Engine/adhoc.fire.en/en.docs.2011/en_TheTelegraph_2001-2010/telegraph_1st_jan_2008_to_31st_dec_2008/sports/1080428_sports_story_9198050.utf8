The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF plans to impose levy on organisers
                                                                                                                                                                                                     AIFF plans to impose levy on organisers
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is planning to impose a huge levy on the organisers of the Bayern Munich versus Mohun Bagan match at the Salt Lake Stadium on May 27.         
	According to sources, the AIFF executive committee, which will meet in the capital on Tuesday, is likely to determine the exact amount that Bengal Peerless, organisers of the high profile exhibition match, should be asked to pay.         
	AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco has already conveyed this decision to his IFA counterpart, Utpal Ganguly, in a meeting here on Sunday.         
	Sources said that the IFA is quite upset with the decision and Ganguly has already asked Colaco to review the AIFFs position regarding the Bayern Munich tie.         
	The IFA is disappointed with the way the AIFF has been creating hurdles for the Bayern-Mohun Bagan match, sources said. First, the AIFF delayed in granting permission for hosting the match. Now they are trying to extract money from the organisers, they added.         
	Ganguly is believed to have informed the AIFF secretary that the organisers of the match were only doing a favour to the game by hosting the tie at their own expense and it would be unfair on the federations part to impose levy.         
	The federation has also informed the IFA that it would not be possible to release national team players from the camp for the Bayern Munichs match.         
	The national coach (Bob Houghton) is against releasing players from the camp, Colaco told Ganguly. A few days back, the AIFF received a request to release Bhaichung Bhutia for a charity match in Europe involving Luis Figo. The request was turned down.         
	The AIFF has also asked the IFA to ensure that everything goes on smoothly on the day of the match. Fifa has written to the AIFF and they are particularly keen to know about the floodlight arrangements at the Salt Lake Stadium, sources said.

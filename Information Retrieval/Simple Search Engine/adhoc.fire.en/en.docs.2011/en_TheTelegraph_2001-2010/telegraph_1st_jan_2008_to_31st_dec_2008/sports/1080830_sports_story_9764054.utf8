The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inzamam has no regrets
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Inzamam has no regrets
                      
	Karachi: Two years have passed since Pakistan walked out of the infamous Oval Test and the then captain, Inzamam-ul Haq, says he does not regret the decision and would take the same step again if such a situation occurs.         
	I have no regrets at all. I did so because (Darrell) Hair had called us cheats He called Pakistani cricketers cheats.         
	It was a slur on our team and nation and I cant tolerate that, Inzamam told a TV channel on Friday.         
	The Oval Test was played in August 2006 and it went down in history as the first Test to be forfeited after Hair and fellow umpire Billy Doctrove awarded the match to England after Pakistan didnt come out on time after the tea break.         
	Hair had penalised Inzamam and his men for ball tampering prior to that.         
	Even the ICC Match Referee adjudicator, Ranjan Madugalle, who is an experienced referee, said at the hearing that Hair had acted in haste and didnt use his authority properly, Inzamam said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai, Riders in intriguing battle
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mumbai, Riders in intriguing battle
            SATISH NANDGAONKAR                      
	Mumbai: An intriguing battle is on the cards as Kolkata Knight Riders take on hosts Mumbai Indians in an important IPL encounter here on Thursday. Both teams, having overcome their form slumps, are on a roll and would be looking to garner vital points to book semi-final spots.         
	With Sanath Jayasuriya in devastating form (114 not out) against Chennai Super Kings on Wednesday, Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly will need his main weapon, Shoaib Akhtar, to fire again.         
	Shoaib, who took four for 11 in three hurricane overs against the Delhi DareDevils last Tuesday, however, hardly exerted himself during Thursdays practice session at the Wankhede.         
	 He sported a kneecap on his right knee and apart from a few friendly balls tossed at captain Sourav in the nets, did not bowl.         
	Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar would certainly hope that the Pakistan speedster fails to do an encore on Friday.         
	Among the larger war between two teams eager to book semi-final berths, the smaller battles would be between former captains Sourav and Sachin and their abilities to handle the pressure in the newest format of the game.         
	Shoaib-Ishant Sharma combine taking on the Sachin-Sanath Jayasuriya duo would be another interesting face-off.         
	Before the start of Delhi DareDevils versus Deccan Chargers match on Thursday, Mumbai Indians were in the sixth spot with eight points, two slots below the fourth-placed Knight Riders.         
	After the Calcutta-based sides backbreaking stint at nets, the Mumbai Indians came in after sundown and had a light practice session.         
	With a fit Sachin back in fray and Sanath showing ominous form, the hosts appear hard to stop.         
	Asked what he would expect Shoaib to do at the pre-match news conference, Ganguly quipped, To get Sachin, Sanath and Uthappa early and finish it off.         
	During his chat with the media, in turn, Sachin admitted that the match would be a close call.         
	For the fans, though, it will be a spectacle.         
	Aaiyla Sourav!, six-year-old Tanya exclaimed as Sourav, clutching three bats under his armpit, stepped out for practice.         
	Huge cheers and whistles from local fans greeted Sachin as he walked onto the ground. Indias best ODI pair last played against each other in a Ranji Trophy final and Ganguly was the one who got more cheers than local hero Sachin.         
	For Kolkata Knight Riders, Ajit Agarkar (who knows the conditions well here), Umar Gul and Ashok Dinda can provide adequate support to pace spearheads Shoaib and Ishant.         
	Toss also would be crucial as the side that calls right would in all probability put the rival team in.         
	Mumbai Indians bowling attack, led by Shaun Pollock, is also capable of exploiting the conditions.

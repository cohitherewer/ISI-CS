  - Im not authorised to forgive anyone, says commissioner       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES            Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh after the hearing before Sudhir Nanavati in Ahmedabad on Friday. (PTI)                                 
	Ahmedabad: In the dock for slapping Team India teammate Sreesanth, a grim looking Harbhajan Singh on Friday appeared for another disciplinary hearing before BCCI-appointed commissioner Sudhir Nanavati who said the probe is over and he will submit his final report on Monday.         
	Sreesanth also appeared before the commissioner, albeit after 90 minutes of Harbhajans arrival.         
	After hearing them separately, Nanavati said he was satisfied with their statements.         
	All the proceeding of the investigation is over and now I dont need to talk to any player or official in this case. Im satisfied with the answers of both their statements. Ive all the evidence that I need to prepare the report, Nanavati said after the hearing.         
	He said both players were very supportive and cooperating during the proceeding.         
	I talked to Harbhajan for an hour and 15 minutes and chatted with Sreesanth for 30 minutes. They were quite friendly.         
	BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah was also present during the cross-examination.         
	Harbhajan had slapped the Kerala pacer after a Mumbai Indians versus Kings XI Punjab match of the ongoing Indian Premier League on April 25.         
	Asked whether Sreesanth had really provoked Harbhajan, Nanavati refused to divulged anything.         
	I will write everything in my report.         
	Nanavati will submit the final report to BCCI president Sharad Pawar on Monday. The BCCI disciplinary committee will take an action based on the report.         
	Replying to another question, Nanavati said: I am not authorised to forgive anyone. I have got all the answers and I am satisfied by the statements that the two players have made.         
	The BCCI disciplinary committee comprise Pawar, Shashank Manohar and Chirayu Amin as members.         
	Even though Harbhajan Singh has pleaded guilty and begged for one last chance, sources said the BCCI is in no mood to relent and intends to set a precedence.

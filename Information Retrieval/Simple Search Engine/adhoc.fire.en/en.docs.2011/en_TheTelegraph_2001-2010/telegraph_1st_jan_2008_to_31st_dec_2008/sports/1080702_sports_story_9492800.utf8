                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gary shares Dhonis concern
  - I think three games in four days in this heat took its toll on players, says Team India coach             Pakistans Younis Khan during a training session in Karachi on Tuesday, the eve of the Asia Cup tie versus India. (AFP)                           
	Team India coach Gary Kirsten feels Mahendra Singh Dhoni has a valid grouse against crammed itineraries as they are affecting players performance.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Getting back to cricket after the three-day break         
	After focussing hard, it was important to take time off cricket. We did that We are through our optional practice sessions and happy with the lead up to the next two games.         
	Irfan Pathans fitness         
	He is fine, he is available for selection now.         
	The failure of strike bowlers in the previous matches         
	Most sides have got big scores. The wicket is very flat, and its not easy for the bowlers. But yes, we have come up with certain ideas on what we need to do. Weve spent some time with the bowlers. We believe in these bowlers, after all they are the same bowlers who did exceptionally well in Australia and in conditions more conducive to swing bowling. We need to do some hard work on these wickets, and we are sure the bowlers will do well.         
	Rohit Sharmas form         
	He is a highly talented player, the star of the future. We are very excited about his talent         
	If its easier when the team is doing well         
	No, its similar both ways Guys want to work hard when doing well, and again it would be the same when not doing well. The work ethic is good and guys are aware of what they are doing.         
	I have worked with individuals, thats the work I enjoy doing For me its about building relationships with them, and understand what they want to do.         
	The fielding and scheduling of matches         
	We are not overtly concerned about our fielding. We made a couple of mistakes in the last match, but I think three games in four days in this heat took its toll on the players. Its unfair to expect players to play top cricket in such short time in 35-degree heat. The players are aware of the mistakes.         
	Suresh Rainas form         
	Hes a fantastic player, has great potential. Hes improving and is a star of the future.         
	Sri Lankas performance         
	The Lankans are playing good cricket. They are organised and have good balance. The will be tough opposition with their batsmen in prime form but we are also in good form. It should be a good contest.         
	Sanath Jayasuriya and Muthiah Muralidharans performance         
	Age has got nothing to do with performance. Great players always perform

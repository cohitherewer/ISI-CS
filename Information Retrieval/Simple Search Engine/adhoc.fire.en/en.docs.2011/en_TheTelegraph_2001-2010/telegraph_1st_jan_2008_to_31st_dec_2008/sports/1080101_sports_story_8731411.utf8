	Colombo: Sri Lanka World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga was on Monday appointed chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) after the resignation of Jayanta Dharmadasa.

	Ranatunga said several slots were ensured for school cricketers in the national pool in the past, but the scenario is different now.

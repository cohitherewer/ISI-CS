The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Middle-order is not a worry: Kumble
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Middle-order is not a worry: Kumble
    - Bangalore Test has boosted our confidence: India captain           OUR CORRESPONDENT              Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh at a practice session on Thursday. (Reuters)                                  
	Mohali: Team India Test captain Anil Kumble on Thursday exuded confidence in his batsmen and said it was just a matter of time before they came up with big scores. The veteran leg-spinner, who is suffering from a shoulder injury, also believes that the Mohali pitch would provide an ideal opportunity for his teams strong batting line-up to fire on all cylinders.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On his injury         
	Its better, well take a call tomorrow (Friday). Its still 24 hours before the match starts. Well see how it (the shoulder) responds. Its a lot better than what it was yesterday (Wednesday). I didnt bowl, took rest.         
	Positives from the Bangalore Test         
	There were a lot of positives The way we bowled and restricted Australia to 400 on a good pitch Probably the pitch played the best on the first two days. The fast bowlers The way Zaheer (Khan) and Ishant (Sharma) bowled.Though we did not get too many wickets in the first innings, we controlled the way the innings progressed. All the batters got good hits, they didnt get big scores but contributed well.         
	The Indian middle order         
	No concern with the middle order. It looks a very good batting surface. This is a good opportunity for our batters. Every batsman looked good in the last game and its a great opportunity for them.         
	Team combination         
	It all depends on how the pitch looks tomorrow morning. What we saw yesterday was pretty dry but we cannot decide at this point of time.         
	Extra fast bowler         
	We have not decided on the combination.         
	Media outburst         
	I dont know what is unlike Anil Kumble. I can only be myself and I think it was an opportunity for me as the captain of the team to express my views, because we dont get many opportunities to do that. Its not only my view. The entire team believes whatever I said and they backed me in that.         
	Lack of depth in the Australian spin attack         
	I think we certainly look at something that we can look at. They obviously miss the quality of Shane Warne or Stuart MacGill, and in Indian conditions, you definitely need a spinner to come into play, if not in the first innings, certainly in the second. That is something we look to cash in on.         
	Sachin milestone         
	Sachin is such a great player, all of us would love him to get there as early as possible. And Im sure hell get there here. Itll be very special not just for Sachin but for world cricket and Indian cricket. To have an Indian right at the top is a great honour for all of us. To have shared the dressing room and seen him score every run sitting inside the dressing room, and sometimes out there at the other end, is a fantastic feeling. Im sure it will happen soon.         
	On his own record in Mohali         
	I enjoy bowling here, have a few landmarks, hopefully my shoulder will be okay to get there and I have to take a call tomorrow.         
	Mohali pitch         
	Its a good wicket, always had something for everyone, not just the fast bowlers. Of course pacers enjoy the early half of the match and the batters get a lot of runs because the ball comes nicely onto the bat. There is enough bounce, not much spin though. This time, maybe because of the rain Mohali has had in the last week or so, it might be on the slower side.         
	Stuart Clarks absence         
	Fitness concerns are there in both camps and its part and parcel of the game. Hes definitely a key bowler if you see the last few matches. Besides, we dont look at individuals.         
	The batsmen         
	All the batsmen looked good in Bangalore. Its just a matter of time before they make it big. The off-the-field controversies         
	Lets concentrate on cricket, thats what I said. Lots of things get spoken about cricket but at the end of the day, its a sport to be played.         
	On Ponting         
	He is a quality player whom you need to get out early. We always have a plan for him and if we can implement that, its a plus for us.

                                                    Aussies should be scared of me: Sreesanth

	New Delhi: Fast bowler Sreesanth said on Tuesday that he could be a thorn in the flesh for Aussie batsmen during the forthcoming tri-series in Australia. 
    
	Watch out for me, I am coming, Sreesanth said during a talent hunt programme organised by Gatorade Speedster 2008. I am not scared of anyone. On the contrary, they (Aussies) should be scared of me. I am back and back after a lot of rest. 
    
	Sreesanth is well aware of the fact that the spotlight now could be on him because of his frequent run-ins with Ricky Ponting and his men, especially Andrew Symonds, during the last India-Australia ODI series at home. 
    
	I am not too bothered about that, he said. Frankly, I always loved spotlight. I am simply excited with the prospect of playing a great series. It was disappointing to miss the Tests. I should now make full use of this opportunity, he said. 
    
	Sreesanth will always remain Sreesanth. I love the game and play it with passion. I would always follow my heart. But then, I know the rules of the game and would never overstep. I will remain committed to the spirit of the game, Sreesanth commented. 
    
	Sreesanth was left out of the national team after he got injured during the ODI against Pakistan in Jaipur. He was advised surgery but he preferred ayurvedic treatment to regain fitness. 
    
	Initially I did not trust ayurveda but it worked magic for me. Fourteen days of treatment followed by 14 days of rest, it was not easy. But Im happy it paid off, he said. 
    
	Sreesanth said he was training at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) when India won the Perth Test. We watched it on big screen. It was simply thrilling. 
    
	Sreesanth and other boys at the academy rushed to the road shouting Bharat Mata ki jai. We made so much noise that cars on the roads stopped. It was simply great fun, Sreesanth said.

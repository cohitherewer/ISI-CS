	Adelaide: Australia completed a 2-1 series victory over India on Monday after the fourth and final Test ended in a draw at the Adelaide Oval.         
	With neither side in a position to push for a result, India batted out the last day before the opposing captains agreed to an early finish.         
	India, who needed to win the match to draw the series, finished the game on 269 for seven in their second innings and an overall lead of 232 runs.         
	The final day was dominated by India opener Virender Sehwag and the emotional retirement of Adam Gilchrist.         
	Australias vice-captain stunned the cricket world on Saturday when he announced he was quitting Test cricket at the end of the match, then one-day Internationals in March.         
	Gilchrist capped his last day in Test cricket with two catches to take his final career tally to 416 dismissals, three days after breaking the world record for a wicketkeeper.         
	Sehwag thumped a brilliant 151 and occupied the crease for more than five hours, contributing more than half the Indian total.         
	The swashbuckling Delhi batsman had been dropped from the Test side in January last year after a poor run but was included in the team in the previous Test at Perth. He has had scores of 29, 43 63 and 151 in Perth and here and will be a part of the Indian team for the next months triangular-series.         
	Resuming their second innings at 45 for one, Sehwag scored his first century in 18 months and held the Indian innings together as wickets kept tumbling at the other end at periodic intervals.         
	No other Indian batsman made more than 20, though most seemed content simply to bat for time rather than runs once the prospect of a result faded.         
	There was never much chance of a result after both teams made in excess of 500 runs in their first innings, but Sehwag at least gave the Indians a glimmer of hope of getting far enough ahead to set up an early declaration on the last day.         
	The 29-year-old blazed his way to his 13th Test century off 123 balls before lunch but was forced to curb his attacking instincts when Rahul Dravid suffered a broken finger and India started losing wickets at regular intervals.         
	Dravid retired hurt on 13 when he was struck on the finger by a short-pitched delivery from Brett Lee, who was named player of the series. The former Indian captain was later diagnosed with a hairline fracture on the right middle finger and will be out of action for two to three weeks.         
	Sehwag then took control and scored the first 42 runs of his association with Sachin Tendulkar before the little master could open his account.         
	The stand produced 72 runs in a mere 69 minutes and 84 balls before Sachin, who was named man of the match after scoring a hundred in the first innings, was run out for 13 after a direct hit from Mitchell Johnson.

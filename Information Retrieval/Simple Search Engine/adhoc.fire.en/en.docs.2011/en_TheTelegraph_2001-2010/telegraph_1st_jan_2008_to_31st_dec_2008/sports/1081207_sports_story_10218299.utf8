                                                                                                                                                                                                       Trying my best to win Cup as coach: Diego
  - My mother thinks that I am the best in the world, says legend       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Diego Maradona after getting off his helicopter in Batanagar, en route to Maheshtala, on Saturday. Picture by Amit Datta                                 
	Calcutta: On Saturday afternoon, when Diego Armando Maradona appeared for his media interaction, the man with the divine left foot seemed to be enjoying every moment of the clamour for him. So infectious was his honest enthusiasm and eagerness to offer a detailed reply to every question, that the session turned out to be a much longer one than the organisers planned it to be.               
	The following are excerpts:               
	Q Carlos Bilardo became Argentina coach in 1984. Two years later, he won the World Cup. Are you going to repeat the feat of your former coach?         
	A It is a very difficult question. I am trying to do my best with the team. It is a young Argentina team and should be able to do well in the World Cup. I am confident of winning the World Cup in 2010.         
	After the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, did you hesitate before coming to India?         
	I have never felt threatened in my life. I was determined to come. I was very pleased and surprised by the reception that I received at the airport. The people here are simply great.         
	What do you think about terror attacks in India?         
	Common people cannot protect themselves against death. They feel helpless. All that I can say is its a barbaric act. Those who have been doing it should stop it immediately.         
	Barrack Obama has been elected the next US president. What do you think about him?         
	The present US president George Bush is an assassin. Obama seems to be a nice man.         
	How do you compare Ronaldinho with Lionel Messi?         
	There cannot be any comparison between the two. Ronaldinho is senior to Messi as a footballer. Ronaldinho has earned a lot of distinction including winning the World Cup. Messi will play football for another 10 years. He, too, will achieve a lot of things in life. I think he will be able to play like me in South Africa.         
	How you are preparing yourself as a coach?         
	As a footballer, I enjoyed playing the game. Now I am trying to share my experience with the current lot of players. These Argentine players are a very intelligent lot and should be able to play as a team.         
	When Carl Heinz Rummenigge came to Calcutta, he described you as the best ever footballer in the world. Please tell us who is the best in the world - Pele or Maradona?         
	I sincerely thank Rummenigge for calling me the best in the world. I respect his opinion. But I dont know who is the best. My mother thinks that I am the best in the world. (Laughs) If she thinks so, then there is no doubt that I am the best.         
	Who has influenced you more in life? Carlos Bilardo or Fidel Castro?         
	Both Castro and Bilardo are very near and dear to me. They are very important people in my life. Both of them stood firmly behind me during my bad days. I have great respect for them.         
	Did you ever have the opportunity to smoke a cigar with Fidel Castro?         
	Several times. We have spent long hours smoking cigars and discussing football and politics. He is a great man.         
	Whats the best way to stay healthy?         
	The best way to stay healthy is to have peace of mind. Apart from doing exercise, one should remain calm. What is important is to get up in the morning to find your daughter by the bedside.         
	What are your regrets in life?         
	There are many but sometimes I lament that I did not spend enough time with my daughters. I had a very bad time in my life. I should have done it, but somehow. There will be a day when I will be able to make up for it.         
	What is your advice for Indian footballers?         
	I know India are not doing too well in the international tournaments. But you have to give the young players a lot of attention so that they grow in life. My best wishes are for the Indian footballers but they should know there is lot of competition in football. The Indian players should not be burdened with the thought of from where they will get their next meal. Their future should be secured.         
	Given a chance, will you help Indian football?         
	At the moment, I have a contract with the Argentina federation. My task is to improve the Argentina team. Once I reach my goal, I will try to come to India. The affection that I have received here is overwhelming. I should come back to India.         
	Tell us, which is the best goal you have scored?         
	(Laughs) The one I scored with the hand of God.         
	Which was your best World Cup?         
	Obviously the one I played in 1986 and won. But then, we played well in the 1990 World Cup also. Unfortunately, we could not win it because of fouls and penalties awarded against us. We could have won that time also.

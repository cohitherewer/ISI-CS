The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Frank Lampard battles past a week of anguish 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Frank Lampard battles past a week of anguish 
  - Midfielder takes Chelsea to first Champions League final         ALAN SMITH            Frank Lampard, who lost his mother just over a week ago, celebrates scoring from a penalty against Liverpool during the second leg of their Champions League semi-final at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. (AFP)                                 
	The day before, he was not going to play. Frank Lampard did not feel ready for such a huge occasion less than a week after the death of his mother. Avram Grant had prepared his Chelsea side for Wednesdays second leg of the Champions League semi-final without his talisman.         
	Overnight, however, there was a dramatic change. Lampard woke up sure that he did want to face Liverpool. Grant looked into Lampards eyes and knew. The lad was okay, the starting 11 was revised.         
	The rest, we might say, is now part of football folklore. While that might sound a little melodramatic so soon after the event, the scenes at Stamford Bridge will never be forgotten.         
	 Not by the Chelsea fans so indebted to the goalscorer, nor by the chap in the stands whose son had just converted a penalty under extraordinary pressure and nudged his side towards the Champions League final.         
	Goodness knows what was going through the mind of Frank Lampard sr, a man probably still in shock following the death of his wife. A man, too, who has had to sit there and listen to the mindless abuse that his son has suffered from an early age. Criminally, not just from opposing fans either.         
	The choice at that point is obvious. You can either withdraw into your shell and slowly fade away, as so many promising talents have done down the years. Or you can make a solemn vow to conquer the criticism by being bloody-minded and brave, by refusing to yield to the boo boys. Lampard did exactly that to earn his Chelsea move, just as he had as a kid when a chubby frame induced teasing from some of his peers.         
	Throughout his life, in fact, the polite Essex boy with the private education has had to prove himself time and time again.         
	Actually, it is a strange old world we live in when someone so inherently decent, so clearly well brought up and so obviously talented can attract the kind of stick that was thrown Lampards way. For instance, after being voted as the England fans player of the year twice in succession, some followers turned against him, blaming him for many of Englands ills.         
	On top of that, the label Fat Frank has somehow stuck  ridiculous, really, when you take a quick look at the stats, see how much ground this marathon man habitually covers.         
	Still, who said the facts had anything to do with it? Lampard has become the favourite whipping boy. A thick skin was duly developed. But ask his family and friends  none has ever known someone quite so strong-willed, someone so intensely determined once his mind is made up.         
	Thats probably why Grant did not hesitate when Lampard came back with his change of heart and why Michael Ballack did not argue when his teammate grabbed the ball to take that penalty.         
	What on earth were you thinking? a close confidant asked afterwards. What do you mean? Lampard innocently replied. I always take the pens.         
	So matter of fact. So in control. While all around emotions ran wild. But then the hero had already been through the emotional wringer, helping his dad organise the funeral of a woman to whom he spoke on the phone two or three times a day.         
	Sipping his beer afterwards, Lampard found it hard to assimilate the achievement. The excitement of Moscow could wait.                 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

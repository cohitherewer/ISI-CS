	London: The eagerly-awaited FA Cup fifth-round clash between Englands two top teams turned out to be a one-sided affair on Saturday as Manchester United thumped 10-man Arsenal 4-0 at Old Trafford.         
	United were 3-0 up after 38 minutes through Wayne Rooney, Darren Fletcher and Nani as Arsenals injury-hit side looked badly off the pace and short of motivation.         
	United, also without some leading players, were just as dominant after the break and Arsenal suffered a further setback five minutes after the restart when Emmanuel Eboue was sent off for a wild challenge on Patrice Evra.         
	Both teams then made substitutions to rest players for midweek Champions League games but United remained on top and got the fourth with another Fletcher header after 74 minutes.         
	Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup in stunning fashion on Saturday when Championship (second division) Barnsley beat them 2-1 at Anfield with a last-minute goal by Brian Howard.         
	Liverpool led through Dirk Kuyt but a Stephen Foster equaliser and brilliant goalkeeping by debutant Luke Steele kept Barnsley in the game before Howard drove in the winner.         
	Frank Lampard scored twice as holders Chelsea progressed with a 3-1 home win over League One (third division) Huddersfield Town while League Two Bristol Rovers upset League One Southampton 1-0 with a late goal on his 26th birthday by Rickie Lambert.         
	In two all-Championship ties, West Bromwich Albion thrashed Coventry City 5-0 away and Cardiff City beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0.         
	Liverpool should be wondering how they failed to progress after creating countless chances.         
	However, having struggled to get past Luton and minor league Havant and Waterlooville in previous rounds, the home fans must have been nervous as they failed to make their superiority count.         
	They went ahead after 32 minutes when Ryan Babel crossed for Dirk Kuyt and the Dutchman who had not scored since December could not miss. Barnsley levelled after 57 when Martin Devaney crossed for centre back Foster to score with a firm header.         
	Yossi Benayoun and Lucas both hit the bar for Liverpool while Steele, the 23-year-old on loan from West Brom, saved superbly to deny Benayoun, Crouch and Harry Kewell.         
	Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez, who had opted to rest top striker Fernando Torres with an eye on his midweek Champions League game against Inter Milan, did throw on Steven Gerrard as a late substitute but even the England midfielder could not find a way through some desperate defending.

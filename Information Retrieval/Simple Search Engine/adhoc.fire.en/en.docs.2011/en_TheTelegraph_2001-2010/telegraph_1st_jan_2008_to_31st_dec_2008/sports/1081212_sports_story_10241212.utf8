	Dunedin: Daniel Flynn made his highest Test score on Thursday, opening day of the first Test between New Zealand and the West Indies as the hosts reached 226 for four.         
	Flynn top scored with 95 after Daniel Vettori won the toss and decided to bat first at the University Oval. Play ended an hour before the scheduled close due to bad light.         
	Debutant opener Tim McIntosh made 34 after taking 44 minutes to score his first Test run. West Indies captain Chris Gayle took three for 42.         
	Flynn had batted for almost four hours and was approaching his first Test hundred when Gayle appealed for an lbw. It was turned down by umpire Amish Saheba, but the West Indies captain wanted a review. TV umpire Rudi Koertzen reviewed the decision and Flynn was declared out.

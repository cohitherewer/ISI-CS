                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tiger turns host
                    Tiger Woods                
	Thousand Oaks (California): Tiger Woods will perform an unaccustomed role this week when he hosts the Chevron World Challenge in a non-playing capacity at Sherwood Country Club.         
	The American world number one has been sidelined from competition since winning his 14th major title at the U.S. Open in June, ending his season to have reconstructive knee surgery.         
	A four-times champion at his own tournament, Woods will be a conspicuous absentee from the 16-man field until he hands over a cheque for $1.35 million to the winner on Sunday.         
	Unfortunately, I cant play that incredible golf course, the 32-year-old said in the build-up to the PGA Tour-sanctioned event. I can only cheer from the sidelines in a cart.         
	So it will be a different kind of week for me, a lot of eating, a lot of sitting in there and grubbing.         
	Since his remarkable U.S. Open victory, where he triumphed just two months after having arthroscopic knee surgery and suffering from a double stress fracture of his tibia, Woods has obediently followed doctors orders.         
	The knee is progressing, he said. Im working hard every day and there have been no setbacks. Ive actually started to do a little chipping and putting, but no full swings. Thats not going to happen until early next year.         
	This week, he will have to leave centre stage to some of his closest rivals.         
	I wish I could defend my title but its going to be fun to watch this field compete, said Woods, who romped to victory by a record seven shots at Sherwood 12 months ago.         
	These are standout guys who bring a lot of game and a lot of personality to the tournament.         
	Six of the worlds top-15 players will be vying for supremacy over the Jack Nicklaus-designed layout.         
	The line-up includes British Open and PGA champion Padraig Harrington of Ireland (ranked fourth), Fijis Vijay Singh (fifth), Colombian Camilo Villegas (seventh) and Americans Anthony Kim (12th), Jim Furyk (13th) and Steve Stricker (14th).         
	Twenty-somethings Villegas, Kim and U.S. Ryder Cup player Hunter Mahan are among the most exciting young talents in the game and are certain to hog much of the limelight.         
	Proceeds from the invitational event go to Tiger Woods Foundation projects and the Tiger Woods Learning Center in Anaheim.         
	The full field is: Harrington, Singh, Villegas, Kim, Furyk, Stricker, Fred Couples, Paul Casey, Boo Weekley, Mahan, K.J. Choi, Kenny Perry, Justin Leonard, Mike Weir, Luke Donald and Stephen Ames.

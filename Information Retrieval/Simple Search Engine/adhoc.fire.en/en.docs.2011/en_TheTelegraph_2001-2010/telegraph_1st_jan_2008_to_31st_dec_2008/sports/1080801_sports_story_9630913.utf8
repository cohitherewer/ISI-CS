The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Real not to give up on Ronaldo
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Real not to give up on Ronaldo
            MARK OGDEN            Cristiano Ronaldo                           
	Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon says the next week will prove decisive in resolving whether the Cristiano Ronaldo soap opera results in the Portuguese forward remaining at Manchester United or joining the Spanish champions.         
	Calderon has again defied United, who reported Real to Fifa as a result of their public attempts to lure Ronaldo from Old Trafford, by insisting that Real Madrid remain committed to signing the double Footballer of the Year.         
	Ronaldo is due to return to Manchester early next week for the first time since helping United to Champions League glory in May. The 23-year-old will begin Phase II of his rehabilitation following ankle surgery.         
	Calderon said United and Ronaldo will talk next week and if, after this conversation, United decide to sell him, then of course Madrid will be there.         
	He added: This is a problem that wasnt created by Real Madrid. Madrid are just spectators in this soap opera.         
	At the moment, Manchester United and the player are in an argument and Madrid are waiting. Obviously, its clear that we want Cristiano with the quality that he has, but there is a contractual problem that United and the player have to resolve, not us.         
	 The only contractual problems between club and player appear to be Uniteds intention for him to honour his contract and Ronaldos desire to to move to Madrid.

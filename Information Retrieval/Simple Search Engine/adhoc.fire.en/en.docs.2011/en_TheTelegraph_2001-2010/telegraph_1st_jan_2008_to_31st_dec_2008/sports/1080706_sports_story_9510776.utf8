	Wimbledon: Venus Williams beat sister Serena 7-5, 6-4 on Saturday to win her fifth Wimbledon title and seventh Grand Slam title.         
	It was Venus first win over her younger sibling in a Grand Slam final since the 2001 U.S. Open, and evened their career head-to-head record at 8-8.         
	Venus came from 3-1 down in the first set to turn around the match, breaking Serena four times while dropping her own serve twice in a high-quality contest in windy conditions. Venus broke to finish the match, with Serena hitting a backhand wide on the second matchpoint.         
	The sisters embraced at the net, and Venus kept her celebrations in check as she twirled and waved to the Centre Court crowd. She accepted the winners trophy  a sterling silver salver aptly named the Venus Rosewater dish  from the Duke of Kent.         
	I have to first of all say great match to Serena, Venus said. I cant believe that its five but when youre in the final against Serena Williams, five seems too far away from that first point.         
	She played so awesome, it was really a task to beat her.         
	Its so rewarding to perform here, Venus added. Every time I come back I know I have the chance to play well and make history. My first job is big sister and I take that very seriously.         
	Watching the match from the players box was the sisters mother, Oracene. Their father, Richard, had flown back to the United States because he cant stand to watch his daughters play against each other. Referring to the mixed feelings of her family about whom to support, Venus said: Its hard for all of them, but I like to think they want me to win.         
	The 26-year-old Serena accepted her runner-up trophy and paid tribute to her 28-year-old sister. Im so happy that at least one of us was able to win, Serena said. Shes played great this year. Were just glad to be in the finals again.         
	Venus, appearing in her seventh Wimbledon final, avenged her two losses to Serena in the 2002 and 2003 title matches and stopped her sister from winning her ninth Grand Slam.         
	Many all-Williams finals have did not live up to expectations, with the sisters having trouble playing their best against each other.         
	But this final produced some breathtaking tennis.                 (AP)

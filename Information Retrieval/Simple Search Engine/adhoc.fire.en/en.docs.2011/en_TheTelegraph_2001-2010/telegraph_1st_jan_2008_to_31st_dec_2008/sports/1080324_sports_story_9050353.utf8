The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Geoff Ogilvy leads on   rain-marred day
                                                   Geoff Ogilvy leads on   rain-marred day
                            
	Miami: Geoff Ogilvy held a one-stroke lead over fellow-Australian Adam Scott when third-round play in the WGC-CA Championship was suspended due to heavy rain on Saturday.         
	World No. 1 Tiger Woods, 11 under par through 11 holes, was in a group three shots behind Ogilvy along with Fijian Vijai Singh and Tim Clark of South Africa.         
	Woods was level-par for his round after three-putting for a bogey at the second and birdying the par-four seventh. Vijai displayed top form and was eight under for his round with two holes to go.         
	Play stopped because of rain and thunder.         
	Indias S.S.P. Chowrasia looked much improved and was three-under through 13 holes when lightning struck. After rounds of 74 and 73, Chowrasia seemed determined to make a mark and his truncated third round proved an impressive show. The Calcutta pro reeled off five birdies against two bogeys before being forced to return with three more holes to go.         
	Overnight tied fourth, Jeev Milkha Singh was one-under through 11 holes before darkness dropped early curtains on the proceedings.         
	Jeev birdied the first and fifth but bogeyed the eighth before the weather suspension forced him out with a mission incomplete.         
	Daniel Chopra managed to rush through his round and the Swede of Indian origin returned his best card of the week so far, an eventful three-under 69, to move up the leaderboard.         
	 Chopra blasted two eagles and three birdies but a bogey on the 11th and a triple bogey on the par-five 12th halted him in his stride.         
	Ogilvy, the 2006 US Open champion, was 14 under overall following birdies at the seventh and ninth but was not happy with his performance.         
	I wasnt hitting the ball great this morning. I felt like I missed every fairway I played, he said.         
	Woods, chasing his 10th win in 11 tournaments worldwide, was disappointed with his putting.         
	I need to hit the ball a touch better but most importantly make some putts and get my speed right, he said.         
	I am only three back, still right there and there are a lot of holes to be played on Sunday, hopefully I can get it going and get hot for the rest of the day.         
	With several of the leaders having 25 holes to play on Sunday, the event is wide open.

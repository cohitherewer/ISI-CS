The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | RP working on slower deliveries
                                                                                                                                                                                                       RP working on slower deliveries
                  R.P. Singh                           
	Noida: Rudra Pratap Singh reckons varying pace would be the key against Australia and the Uttar Pradesh left-arm pacer says he has developed a slower ball that would prove quite a handful for Ricky Ponting and his men, when they arrive for a Test series in India next month.         
	R.P. feels the Aussies would be hard to bowl at even when they are playing away, and the surprise element should be there if a bowler has to succeed against them.         
	As a preparation for the Australia series, I am just concentrating on my basics, the bowler said on the sidelines of an interactive session with the students of a university here on Wednesday.         
	But I am trying some new variations as well and have developed a new slower delivery, the pacer said.         
	Besides, Im also working on bouncers, he added.         
	The Indians will have to be at their best to thwart the Australians and they are likely to roll out dustbowls against the visitors to suit their traditional spin strength. R.P., however, felt they can afford to play on lively pitches which would have something for the spinners as well.         
	I would prefer lively pitches, which should be fair to all and make it an even contest between bat and ball, he remarked.         
	India have a decent pool of pacers to choose from for the four-match Test series against Australia, and R.P. thinks the competition for the berths augurs well for the team.         
	This healthy competition is good for Indian cricket. Personally, too, you get to learn so many things. Even a senior bowler learns things from the youngsters, especially their mental approach, he said.         
	R.P. also stressed on the need for a strict fitness regime to restrict injuries to a minimum and keep going.         
	Injury is a part of our life, we cant escape from it. But if we follow a strict fitness regime and work under trainers instructions, we can at least reduce it, he said.         
	R.P. shares a good chemistry with his one-day and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and the left-arm seamer is forthright about whom he wants to see as Indias next Test captain.         
	Anil Kumble is a good captain, he has everything what it needs. But if somebody becomes the next Test captain, it will be Dhoni, R.P. said.         
	Dhoni is a thinking guy and is already captaining India in ODIs and Twenty20 with aplomb, he said.           (PTI)

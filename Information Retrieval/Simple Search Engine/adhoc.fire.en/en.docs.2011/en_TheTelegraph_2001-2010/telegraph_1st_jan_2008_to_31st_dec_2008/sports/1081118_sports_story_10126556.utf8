            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Debutant Rohan Banerjee sounded as comfortable with the microphone as he was with the willow on Monday.         
	The 19-year old provided smart answers while taking questions from a group of journalists at the end of second days play. He said that his normal approach has helped him gain the outstanding feat on his favourite ground.         
	I was just normal. I played my natural game and that helped me a lot. I stayed at the wicket and runs came the southpaw said.         
	Asked if the fatigue of playing such a long innings played a role behind his missing the double century, Rohan said: I was not tired. But I played a couple of bad shots I feel there was a lapse in concentration         
	They have a good attack At different stages I was a bit tensed. But I kept my cool and went on with the game I was patient.         
	An elated Shibnath Roy, Rohans coach, said: I am very happy today. Rohan played a dream innings I knew that he will be a good cricketer from the day I started training him.         
	Rohan had started his career with the Durgapur Cricket Club and presently plays for Kalighat.

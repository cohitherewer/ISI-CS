The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No agreement on Board of Trustees
                                                                                                                                                                                                       No agreement on Board of Trustees
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president, Prasun Mukherjee, on Monday expressed his disappointment that the Board of Trustees would have to be elected rather than selected during the elections on July 29.         
	Talking to reporters after the ruling group filed their nominations for the five-member trustee board, Mukherjee said he had approached the opposition on deciding the panel mutually.         
	I had said that elections should not be held for the Board of Trustees, but it didnt happen. I waited for their response but eventually nothing happened, Mukherjee said.         
	The opposition, however, said there was no official communication. A close aide of Jagmohan Dalmiya said that the ruling group wanted to get a couple of members selected unopposed which was impossible under the circumstances.         
	First of all, nothing was officially said to us... The topic came up during an informal chat but I asked why only some positions should be unopposed. Jagmohan Dalmiya should also be selected as president unopposed in that case, a senior member pointed out.         
	The CAB president exuded confidence in his panel. I think we will win comfortably at least I expect that at this moment, Mukherjee said.         
	He also defended the incumbent office-bearers against all allegations of misappropriations of fund.         
	The explanations regarding the expenses had been given at all the forums. All finances were passed in the finance committee and the working committee meetings. Now some of them are trying to make an issue out of it, Mukherjee fumed.         
	Dipak Das Gupta, president of West Bengal Office Sports Federation, will take on P.B. Dutta for the post of chairman in the Board of Trustees. Biren Mitra, Ashok Roy, Gobinda Prasad Dutta and Ravi Todi complete the line-up for the ruling group.         
	Incidentally, city civil court judge Anindita Roy Saraswati on Monday heard the petition filed by Central Calcutta Sporting Club seeking appointment of an observer to ensure free and fair elections at the annual general meeting. The judge said an order would be passed on Thursday regarding the appeal.

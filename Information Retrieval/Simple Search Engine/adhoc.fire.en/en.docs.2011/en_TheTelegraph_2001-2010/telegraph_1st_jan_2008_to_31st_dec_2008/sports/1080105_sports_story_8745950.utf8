The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC wants player referrals on trial
                                                  ICC wants player referrals on trial
            A STAFF REPORTER            Malcolm Speed                           
	Calcutta: Poor umpiring in the Sydney Test has prompted the International Cricket Council (ICC) to push for a player-driven appeal system to minimise umpiring errors.         
	Chief executive Malcolm Speed told ABC Radio on Friday that the ICC wanted to carry out an experiment giving players the right to lodge appeals against contentious rulings and ask the third umpire to adjudicate with the aid of television replays.         
	Speed said the plan  similar to the one now used in professional tennis  was designed to take the pressure off onfield umpires. Under the system, a team would have the privilege of appealing up to three decisions in an innings, but the ICC made it clear that it would not be used in Test matches.         
	I dont think it will be trialled in Tests, Speed said. Theres a Champions Trophy coming up in Pakistan and that would be the time when all the best umpires and technology are there and we could get an idea of how it works.         
	The ICC has made it clear that it will not go back to fielding home umpires during Test matches. Sunil Gavaskar, chairman of the cricket committee, said the neutral umpire system eliminates the suspicion of bias.         
	Speed said the ICC had been investigating the best ways to make use of modern technology for a number of years but had been unable to come up with a plan that everyone supported.         
	The cricket community is still divided about the batsmen and bowler having an appeal, he said. We have to respect the traditions of the game... but there may be another change in the wind, more countries may support a trial of the system.         
	Speed said he was especially conscious of not reducing the importance of onfield umpires and would insist on placing a limit on the number of appeals that can be made in an innings so that the game was not constantly disrupted.         
	Generally theres a sense the decisions even themselves out. The dilemma is that technology has got better and what do we do with it? he said.         
	A lot of people are saying this is the answer, but were not sure, so lets see if it works, then have the debate.         
	Speed also said that not all umpires were having the same opinion on using the popular hawk-eye technology.         
	Some umpires support it, others say its taking too much away and well simply become coat-hangers for the players, he said.         
	An appeal system was first proposed by Speed and David Richardson, the ICC general manager of cricket, in 2006 and it passed through the organisations cricket committee and chief executives.         
	Then we took it to the chairmen of the ICCs full member countries and the vote was 5-5. Pakistan led the fight against and Australia was against it too. Seven must vote in favour for an issue to be passed, Speed said.         
	He added that member countries would have to vote again. We go at one stage again to a vote of the ICC board and the member nations, if they want to have the trial or they dont want to have the trial

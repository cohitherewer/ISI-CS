The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Be ruthless or face the music, warns Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Be ruthless or face the music, warns Ponting
                  Ricky Ponting                     
	Sydney: Under-fire Australian captain Ricky Ponting on Tuesday had stern words for his teammates, saying it was imperative for them to play at a higher level following the humiliating series defeat against India and that nobody should take his place in the team for granted.         
	Ponting said there was no reason why Australia could not bounce back and win all the six home Tests this summer despite the setback in India and it was time for his team to make a positive statement.         
	We have to play at a higher level than we did through the India tour, theres no doubt about that, and theres no excuses and theres no reason why we cant, Ponting told reporters at the airport shortly after arriving from the tour of India where they lost the Test series 0-2.         
	He said he would not allow the defeat to have a bearing on his captaincy. I will continue to be a ruthless captain and a ruthless player and I expect my teammates to be the same.         
	And if theyre not now, having lost a Test series in India, we have to look around for some other guys, he warned.         
	Ive got total confidence that we can bounce back and that we can win every Test we play in Australia this year, he said.         
	Ponting was adamant Australia deserved to retain their No.1 ranking despite the series loss and predicted his team would play some of the best Test cricket weve seen for a while in the upcoming home Tests against New Zealand and South Africa.         
	Ponting said it was important for the team to come out and make a positive statement after admitting India had played the more consistent cricket over the course of the four Test series.         
	Just seeing the look on some of the guys faces on the plane, there is genuine excitement about moving on from the Indian series.         
	Its important we put that series behind us as quickly as we can and we start focussing on whatever positives there were out of the Indian series and start looking ahead to New Zealand and South Africa in Australia.         
	Ponting stoutly defended his decision to use his spinners and part-time bowlers to make up for slow over-rate rather than relying on specialist fast bowlers on the fourth day of the final Test.         
	He said he felt spinner Cameron White had been a good option because of the bounce he could get and that his pacemen needed a break after having been used for most of the pre-tea period.         
	I still feel the decisions I made werent negative at all. Ive had an opportunity to sit back and think about those decisions I made there and then, Ponting said. Even after talking to other players, Im very comfortable with the decision that I made, he added.         
	Spin legend Shane Warne urged the Australian public not to vilify Ponting but admitted he too was surprised by some of the skippers decision during the 0-2 Test series defeat to India.         
	His tactics surprised me  and everyone else  because he is naturally an attacker. The reason he is under fire is because he put himself before the teams interest and this just isnt Punter.         
	Having played with him for a long time, he was one of the guys that put the team first  always. If it meant throwing his wicket away in the chase for quick runs, he would do that. And there have been previous captains who would not.         
	I just think he got it wrong this time and Im sure he will be a better captain for the experience. Lets not hang him. Lets encourage him and support him. I think the Kiwis are going to feel the wrath of the Australian team and, in particular, the skipper next week, the leg-spin great wrote in his column.         
	Hopefully, Ricky understands where everyones criticism is coming from, takes it on board and does not wipe people. Im sure if he thinks it through, he could do worse than ask Ian Chappell or Allan Border out for dinner and chat about it and he might just pick up something.         
	Warne also had some tips to offer about the high pressure job of leading a team.         
	Captaincy is about getting the best out of your players and understanding what makes them tick  when to give them a rocket and when to throw an arm around them and make them feel important. This comes from understanding your player and which strategy to use.         
	And in this, Warne considers Mark Taylor as the master.         
	Mark was an expert at this and was the best captain I played under. He was a great tactician, too. Regarding the India series where the Aussies came up second best, Warne said he was worried with the manner of defeat.         
	We all know that outside of Australia, India is the toughest place to tour because the conditions are so different from anywhere else you play. To me, it is not that we lost the series but more the way we lost which is a concern for many of us former players.         
	The Australian side to me looks like its lacking a bit of spark. But having said that, India can have that effect on you.                 (AGENCIES)

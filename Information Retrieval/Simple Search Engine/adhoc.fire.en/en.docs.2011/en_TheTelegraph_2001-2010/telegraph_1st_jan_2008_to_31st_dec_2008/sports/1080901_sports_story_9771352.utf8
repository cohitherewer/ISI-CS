The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bernie has no problem with Max
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bernie has no problem with Max
                      
	London: Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday called on the sport to forget the controversy surrounding International Automobile Federation (FIA) president Max Mosley.         
	Ecclestone had previously called for his long-time friend Mosley to resign after newspaper stories about his private life.         
	But after winning his privacy case against a British newspaper which alleged he took part in a nazi-themed sadomasochistic orgy with prostitutes, Ecclestone believes that Mosley is still a credible president.         
	I thought and was told it would (cost the sport) but people have come to the conclusion that whatever happened with Max was Max and it has nothing to do with anything else, Ecclestone said.         
	I dont think they care any more, people forget all these things. At the time it was a shock, if it had happened to other people it probably wouldnt have been a shock. For a short period I said he should resign because I had so much pressure from people to say he should resign. In a lot of ways, at the time I wished he had done. Now I dont see why he should. Max works and does the best he can for the sport, 100 per cent.         
	Ecclestone insists he will treat Mosley as normal when they meet at the Italian Grand Prix on September 14.         
	Ill see him in Monza, he said. Ill welcome him back. He should come back and carry on like he normally carries on.         
	Mosley has said he will not stand for re-election when his term runs out next year, but Ecclestone added: He said he would stand down before and he hasnt. If we look at it selfishly and look at the sport, its difficult to see who would replace him and do the things he does. That is what the difficulty is.         
	Meanwhile, Ecclestone voiced concerns over how London will match the Beijing Olympics, and he has ruled out helping the 2012 planners.         
	I cant see how London, or anyone, will follow that. We have to do something completely different or we are going to look idiots. (AFP)

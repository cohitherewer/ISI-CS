                                                   Sri Lanka under pressure
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sri Lanka would drop to fifth spot on the ICC Test Championship table if they lose the series versus the West Indies which gets underway in Guyana on Saturday.         
	If Sri Lanka lose the two-match series 2-0 or 1-0, they will fall two places from third to fifth, below South Africa and England even if Paul Collingwood and his men lose the third and final Test in New Zealand which also gets underway on Saturday.         
	According to an ICC release, Sri Lanka are on third spot, two ratings points behind India and just a fraction of a point ahead of the South Africans, who are about to embark on a three-Test series. With England just two points further back, the potential for movement is great.         
	If the West Indies win the series 2-0, they would gain nine ratings points.However, whatever happens in the series the West Indies will remain in eighth position. If England win the final Test they will gain one rating point.

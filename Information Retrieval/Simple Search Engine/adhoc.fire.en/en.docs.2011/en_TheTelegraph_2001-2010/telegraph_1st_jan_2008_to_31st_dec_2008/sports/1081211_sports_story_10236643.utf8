	Calcutta: A 4-2 win against Mohammedan Sporting on Wednesday was not enough for Mahindra United as they failed to reach the semi-finals of the 30th Federation Cup, losing out to Churchill Brothers on goal margin.         
	Edeh Chidi scored a brace while Steven Dias and Mohammed Rafi rounded off the tally for Mahindra. Local club Mohammedan Sportings goals came from Mohammed Shahid and Vimal Pariyar.         
	As news started coming in from Churchills match against HAL, Mahindra coach Derrick Pereira looked visibly upset. He even broke his chair in frustration as Mahindra conceded two late goals.         
	Dias put Mahindra ahead in the 18th minute. A foul by Mohammedan Sportings Anit Ghosh earned Mahindra a free kick outside the box. Diass curling right-footer went in off a goalmouth melee. Chidi also played a dummy to compound the goalkeepers woes.         
	Dias displayed his class once more when he sent a super low cross into the box from the right flank in the 33rd minute. Mohammed Rafi headed down the ball for an unchallenged Chidi who calmly shot home. Mahindra looked hungry for goals and added a couple more to their tally from two penalties  in the 54th and 65th minutes.         
	Sheikh Azim pulled down Rafi inside the box and the referee A. Arjunan felt no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Rafi himself scored from the spot kick.         
	The second penalty was awarded for Ramla Francis Novas foul on K.N. Ajayan. The referees decision was followed by lengthy protests from the Mohammedan Sporting players. They claimed that the foul had occurred outside the box but the referee thought otherwise. Chidi added to his tally, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way. Four goals down, Mohammedan Sporting went all out, throwing caution to the wind. The attitude bore fruit as they scored two late goals.         
	Mohammed Shahids accurate header off Novas free kick gave Subhasish Roy Chowdhury no chance.         
	The next goal, probably the best of the match, came from substitute Vimal Pariyar in the 90th minute.         
	After coming on for Satyajit Bose at the fag end, Pariyars superb free-kick from outside the box went over the wall and into the top corner of the goal.         
	Teams         
	Mahindra United: Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, Lamne Tamba, Ravanan Dharamraj, Sukhwinder Singh, Sushanth Mathew, Steven Dias (K. Thoi Singh 73), N.P. Pradeep, Edeh Chidi, Mohammed Rafi, Debabrata Roy, Manjit Singh (K.N. Ajayan 64).

	Referee: A. Arjunan.

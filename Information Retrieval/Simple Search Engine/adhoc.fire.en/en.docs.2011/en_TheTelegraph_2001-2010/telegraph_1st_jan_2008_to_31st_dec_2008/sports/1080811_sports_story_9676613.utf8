	Harika to meet Nikolova  Gaziantep: Top seed and International Master D Harika will meet Adriana Nikolova of Bulgaria in the eighth round of the World Junior Girls rsquo; Chess Championship here.
  Sitting pretty with a half point lead on six points, Harika, who is the reigning under-18 girls rsquo; world champion, has an excellent chance of becoming the second Indian girl after Koneru Humpy to annex the junior crown.    
	 Andy in final  Los Angeles: Andy Roddick will be out to prove that missing the Beijing Olympics was a wise choice as he bids for his third title of the season in the final against Juan Del Potro at the Los Angeles Classic.  The American earned his first trophy shot since winning Dubai nearly six months ago, defeating German Denis Gremelmayr 6-2, 6-2. Del Potro dominated American Mardy Fish 6-2, 6-1 in their semi-final to win his 13th straight ATP match.    
	 Jeev stranded  Michigan: Jeev Milkha Singh was stranded at the second hole when rains washed out his penultimate round at the PGA Championships, leaving the Indian to play 35 holes on the final day of the event here. Jeev had parred his opening hole and was tied for the eighth spot when rains lashed the Oakland Hills course forcing suspension of play. The final day now promises to be a draining one for the Indian, who is already battling an injured ankle.

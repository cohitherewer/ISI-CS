The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Amla shines on rain-marred day
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Amla shines on rain-marred day
                      
	London: Play was called off on the third day of the fourth Test between England and South Africa after rain reduced Saturdays action to just 82 minutes.         
	Lunch was taken early and, with drizzle persisting, the umpires called off play just before 1600 GMT.         
	South Africa were 110 for two in their second innings, 12 runs behind Englands first innings total of 316.         
	In the morning, Hashim Amla completed his half century to steer South Africa close to level terms with England.         
	South Africa lost Neil McKenzie in a morning session shortened by rain, when he edged a ball from Stuart Broad on to his stumps.         
	The visitors had resumed following a half-hour rain delay on 37 for one, 85 behind, after England had taken the wicket of captain Graeme Smith on Friday evening.         
	Amla batted with assurance, reaching 71 not out with 14 fours though he had an escape when he edged an Andrew Flintoff delivery behind. Tim Ambrose dived at full stretch to his left and got a glove to the ball but failed to hang on to a difficult chance with the score on 95.         
	Jacques Kallis, disappointing with the bat this tour despite South Africas series win, their first in England since 1965, was not out on two.         
	Amla took full advantage of a wayward England attack. James Anderson and Steve Harmison both bowled far too wide of the off stump, allowing Amla to hammer 14 boundaries in his 86-ball innings.         
	Amla brought up his ninth Test 50 with a square cut off Andrew Flintoff. (REUTERS)

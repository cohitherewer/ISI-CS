	War over Messi  
	 Madrid: Barcelona will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) if Fifa tell them to release Argentine forward Lionel Messi for the Olympic Games, club president Joan Laporta said on Monday.

	Massu rsquo;s belief

	Wrestlers rsquo; hope  
	 New Delhi: Beijing-bound Indian wrestlers may not be in the limelight in the run up to the Olympics, but the discipline that gave the nation its first individual medal 56 years ago in the Helsinki Games could produce another podium finisher if luck and draw go Indias way at the 29th edition.

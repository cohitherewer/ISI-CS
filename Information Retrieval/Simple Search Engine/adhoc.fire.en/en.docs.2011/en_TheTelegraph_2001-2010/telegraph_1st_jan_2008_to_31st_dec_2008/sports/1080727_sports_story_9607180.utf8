                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kumble vows to come back strong
            A CORRESPONDENT            Kumble                           
	Colombo: The following is what India captain Anil Kumble had to say after the innings defeat against Sri Lanka here on Saturday:         
	On the match         
	They bowled exceptionally well. It was never going to be easy after they had 600 on the board. Avoiding the follow on was always going to be tough. The wicket was not really helping spin but once you bat that way in the first innings it was going to be tough.         
	What are the things India need to work on?         
	We need to work on all three departments of the game and just not one. We dropped a few catches, Mahela was dropped and so was Samaraweera. Zaheer got a wicket of a no-ball.         
	What are your views on Ajantha Mendis?         
	We did not concentrate only on Mendis. I did mention before the start of the match that Murali and Vaas are the important bowlers and nothing has changed. It was only that we are asked more about Mendis in media conferences. Murali is a champion bowler.         
	Do you think the batters need to change their technique?         
	There is no need to look at a change in technique. No other line-up is more technically equipped. They are players who have played more than more than 100 Tests.It is important for the bowlers to also put their hands up.         
	Are you thinking about playing Pragyan Ojha in the second Test? Do you think India will be able to stage a comeback?         
	It is too early to talk about the team for the next game. And about comeback, we have done it in the past, it is the same team that has brought some wonderful results. I am confident we will come back.         
	India do not have a good record in first Tests when they play abroad. Your team seem to have inherited that record.         
	Statistics dont lie but we dont think that way. Not thinking on those lines.We had our chances, it is not that we take time to settle.         
	What has to be done?         
	Need to regroup, we do plan. When things dont go our way people think there is no plan in place. It is the same process. Obviously we need to look at our strategy in handling Murali and Mendis. We have to be a little more positive.

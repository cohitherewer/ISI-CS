                                                   Inzy justifies ban on Shoaib
                      
	Chandigarh/Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq on Thursday justified the five-year ban imposed on Shoaib Akhtar, saying the controversial fast bowler had been asking for trouble for quite some time now.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) seems to have taken the decision after a careful thought. I dont think they have hurried into making this decision, Inzamam, who is leading the Lahore Badshahs in the Indian Cricket League, said.         
	Inzamam justified the action by the PCB, though he pointed out that it was a bit too harsh.         
	He, however, said the way Shoaib had been behaving for the past couple of years, the (ban) was the natural outcome. Former Pakistan leggie Mushtaq Ahmed also felt that Shoaib had been courting trouble for a long time.         
	He (Shoaib) should have disciplined himself and behaved in a more responsible manner, Mushtaq, who is also in the Lahore Badshahs, said.         
	Inzamam however, had a word of advice for beleaguered Shoaib that appealing against the ban was all right, but he should avoid venting his anger through the media.         
	Shoaib should know that by hitting back (at the PCB) through media is not going to help him. Players should be more disciplined and should behave in a dignified manner, Inzaman said.         
	Allrounder Abdul Razzaq, who is also playing in the ICL, also felt the ban on Shoaib was very harsh.         
	Banning Shoaib is a big jolt to the Pakistani cricket and this should be reviewed. Players should not be punished like that, Razzaq opined.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistans senior batsman Younis Khan called for a mutual and quick resolution of the ongoing row between the PCB and Shoaib Akhtar.         
	I think this issue should be sorted out with mutual consent and by talking it through, Younis said.         
	Cricket is one department which has been safe from chaos and confusion in Pakistan. So it is sad that such a row has escalated now, he said.         
	Younis sympathised with Shoaib and said if a cricketer was banned for a long period his performance was bound to suffer.         
	My own performances suffered when I got involved in such type of controversies I just hope this problem is resolved quickly with mutual consent for the sake of Pakistan cricket, Younis added.         
	Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik, however refused to comment on the matter, saying the ban was an issue between Shoaib and the board.           (PTI)

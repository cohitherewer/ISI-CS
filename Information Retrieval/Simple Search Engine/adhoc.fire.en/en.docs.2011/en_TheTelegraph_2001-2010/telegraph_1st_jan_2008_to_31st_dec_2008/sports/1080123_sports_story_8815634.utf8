                                                   AITA to probe fixing claim

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	New Delhi: A day after Mahesh Bhupathi said in Melbourne that he was approached by illegal bookmakers to lose a Davis Cup World Group tie in 1996, All India Tennis Association (AITA) has decided to launch an enquiry into the episode. 
    
	The All India Tennis Association has taken a serious note of the revelation made by Mahesh Bhupathi in respect of the Davis Cup tie against Holland in February 1996, AITA secretary Anil Khanna said. 
    
	The AITA is very clear that the Davis Cup is absolutely clean and no such incident has ever been heard of, before or in the recent past, in India. It is necessary for India as a nation to protect its image and integrity among the tennis playing nations of the world. 
    
	Khanna said that Yashwant Sinha, the president of the association, has asked him to find out the truth as soon as possible. 
    
	The probe report, Khanna said, would also be sent to the International Tennis Federation (ITF). 
    
	In an interview in Melbourne on Monday, Bhupathi said he had turned down an offer to throw a Davis Cup match against Holland in Jaipur, which was eventually won by the hosts 3-2. 
    
	I immediately changed my phone numbers and I never got another similar call. It definitely freaked me out, the doubles specialist has been quoted as saying. 
    
	The AITA secretary dismissed the whole thing as a stray incident and expressed confidence that it wont have any far reaching impact on the game in India . 
    
	I would like to say to the ITF this is just a stray incident and we feel this does not happen here at all, Khanna said.

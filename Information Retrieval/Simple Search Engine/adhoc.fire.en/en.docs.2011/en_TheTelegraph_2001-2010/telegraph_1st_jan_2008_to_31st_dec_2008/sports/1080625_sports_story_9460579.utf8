The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | When Lloyd was left stunned                                                                                                                                                                                                        When Lloyd was left stunned     - High praise for Kapil from the then West Indies captain                                           
	Clive Lloyd, the West Indies captain, had spoken to The Telegraph about the first three World Cups in a one-on-one on the eve of the 1996 edition.         
	The following are excerpts from what hed then said about the 1983 final:         
	Memories of June 25, 1983         
	I was hoping to collect the trophy for the third time in succession and, yes, when that didnt come about I was sort of stunned... That disappointment remains... The team which played better that day won.         
	Whether the West Indies had been complacent that day         
	No, we just batted poorly. I presume if India had set us a target of 240 or thereabouts instead of 184, our approach would have been better. Facing a small total, we simply capitulated.         
	Rating Kapil Dev as captain on a scale of 10         
	Most definitely nine. He could turn a match on its head, and he proved it at Tunbridge Wells against Zimbabwe. Indeed, if India came back from the dead, it was only due to Kapil.

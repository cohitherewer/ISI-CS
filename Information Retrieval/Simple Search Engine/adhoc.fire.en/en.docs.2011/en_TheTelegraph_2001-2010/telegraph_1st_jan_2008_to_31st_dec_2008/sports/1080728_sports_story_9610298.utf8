	Karachi: Expressing dissatisfaction over the way Pakistan Cricket Boards selection panel works, skipper Shoaib Malik said he wants to have a say in the final selection of the team.         
	The composition of the final eleven is discussed with selectors. Myself and the coach try to convince the selectors but the final decision rests with them and it is also mentioned in the players central contract, Malik said.         
	According to sources, Malik had asked for more powers in selection matters leading to a heated discussion with the selectors and some Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and governing body officials at the recent meeting held to review the performance of the team in the Asia Cup.         
	Malik was apparently upset over the exclusion of the wicketkeeper batsman Kamran Akmal from the Asia Cup squad. (PTI)

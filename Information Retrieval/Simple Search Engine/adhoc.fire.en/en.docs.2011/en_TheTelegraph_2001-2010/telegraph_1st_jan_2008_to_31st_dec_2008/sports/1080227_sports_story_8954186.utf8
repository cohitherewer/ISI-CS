                                                    Sledging is an art, says Dhoni

      A CORRESPONDENT
      Mahendra Singh Dhoni takes Sanath Jayasuriyas catch in Hobart on Tuesday 
             
	Hobart: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, fresh from leading India into the tri-series finals, on Tuesday said sledging is an art and the Australians have perfected it but it wont take long for his boys to learn the tricks of the trade. The wicketkeeper-batsman singled out the fast bowlers for special praise during the post match press conference. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
       
	Nature of the pitch 
    
	This track was more suitable for batting. It was flat though there was some bounce as well. I expected something for the quicks in the morning because it was cloudy but there wasnt much help and they (Sri Lanka) got off to a good start. Our first change bowlers, Praveen and Irfan, bowled really well and got some quick wickets. It was very important because after some time there was no help for the bowlers and it was difficult to get even the tail-enders out. 
    
	Praveen Kumars performance 
    
	Before today, he didnt have a single wicket on the international stage. To get a wicket and more and back it up with the Man of the Match award was very heartening. Thats what you expect from the youngsters. If he can improve his batting a little more he will be an asset to the team. 
    
	Playing five bowlers vs Sri Lanka 
    
	We have been batting quite well against Sri Lanka and scoring quite a few runs. We wanted that extra bowler. We wanted to play swing bowlers against Australia and seamers against Lanka and that has worked out very well for us. If we do play five bowlers, then the only guy who misses out is Virender Sehwag. 
    
	Sachin Tendulkars knock 
    
	Every time people have written about him or written him off, he has proved them wrong. Thats what we have to be really careful about. When we say or write about him, we must consider his class and contribution to Indian cricket. 
    
	Personal milestone of 100 ODI catches 
    
	I dont think I am the best keeper, though I always try to be safe. As long as I hold the catches that come my way, I am happy. My keeping has improved a lot but there still is scope for betterment. 
    
	Australians provoking the Indians 
    
	That was the scene in the last instance. It has been going on for a long time. We have to be careful. If they provoke us, we need to mind what we say. Our youngsters react and get fined for things like that. Ishant just reacted to what Symonds said. Its an art and they are good at it but we will learn soon. 
    
	Relation between the two teams 
    
	It has never been friendly. Cricket can never be friendly. There will be aggression and that is fine so long as it is within limits. 
    
	The illegal gloves 
    
	The gloves are okay but if it was getting close to the line between being legal and illegal, I thought there is no point in getting into another controversy. I dont think the webbing helps you too much. No more than five out of my 100 one-day catches would have stuck in the webbing. It is mostly the hands that hold the catches. When you have seven pairs in the bag, may as well use some other pair than a controversial one!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin for debate on Kevins shot
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sachin for debate on Kevins shot
                  Sachin Tendulkar                     
	Silverstone: Sachin Tendulkar believes Kevin Pietersens controversial switch-hitting technique should not be banned but said crickets laws needed clarifying.         
	England batsman Pietersen sparked a debate last month when, before the bowler reached his delivery stride, he switched to a left-handers grip and stance and twice hit New Zealands Scott Styris for six in a one day International. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), custodians of the games laws, quickly convened to discuss the tactic and announced that the innovation conformed to the existing rules.         
	However, Tendulkar, a batsman who has always combined a classic technique with wristy innovation, feels the approach needs more thought. I think they will have to look at it far more closely than has been done; it changes the laws, he said on Sunday.         
	Its about lbw decisions, how are you going to decide which is off stump and which is leg? My opinion is that when a right-handed batsman takes his guard it doesnt matter which shot he plays, hes a right hander and the field can be set accordingly. The moment a right-handed batsman becomes a left hander and changes his grip, changes his stance, then if youve got three slips you have three leg slips  and its a no ball, Tendulkar explained.         
	Its far more complicated than it appears, the best option is probably to stick to if hes a right hander, it doesnt matter where the ball pitches, the off stump will always be off stump, the Indian added.         
	Tendulkar, an all-time great in Tests and the most successful ODI batsman with more than 16,000 runs to his name, is not against progress, however. He has embraced Twenty20 cricket, though injury restricted his appearance in the Indian Premier League, and says the constantly evolving challenge between bat and ball will always throw up such advances.         
	These are the natural changes and innovations of the game, he said. Close to 10 years ago, when (former Zimbabwe batsman) Andy Flower started playing reverse sweep I said that in the next five years this would become a common shot. Now many batsmen play it and in time more innovations will come from batsmen and bowlers.         
	Tendulkar, speaking ahead of Sundays British Grand Prix where he was supporting the Force India team, felt that Twenty20 cricket had already had an impact on the approach of batsmen.         
	The game is changing, its becoming more and more attacking and players are prepared to take more risks, he said. Its only because the different versions have been introduced. In one-day cricket there are still spells when you just need to see things through and in Test cricket that happens often. But if you can chase 180 or 190 in 20 overs then why cant you chase 325 in 50 overs? The thought process will definitely change.         
	When you play Twenty20 its about how you think. It has already changed from when that form of the game started. Batsmen are thinking differently. (REUTERS)

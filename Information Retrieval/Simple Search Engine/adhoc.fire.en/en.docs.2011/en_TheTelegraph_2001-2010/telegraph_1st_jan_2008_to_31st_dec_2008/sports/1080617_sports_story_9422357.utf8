                                      MCC to discuss Kevin shot   London: The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) will discuss on Tuesday England batsman Kevin Pietersen rsquo;s spectacular switch-hitting in a one-day International against New Zealand on Sunday. The right-handed Pietersen twice changed grips and switched to a left-hander rsquo;s stance against Scott Styris, pulling both deliveries for six. Some commentators said he had taken an unfair advantage because bowlers have to notify a batsman if they decide to bowl with the other arm.
  A spokeswoman for the MCC, the custodian of cricket rsquo;s laws, said Pietersen rsquo;s revolutionary tactics would be discussed on Tuesday at the request of the International Cricket Council.  On trial  New Delhi: An umpire decision review system will be tested during India rsquo;s three-Test series against Sri Lanka. Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary Niranjan Shah said the cricket board has agreed to the trial of the system in the Test series starting from July 23. Under the proposal, a player may request the review of any decision taken by the on-field umpires concerning every dismissal with the exception of lsquo;timed out rsquo;.  No rift: Afridi  Karachi: Pakistan allrounder Shahid Afridi on Monday dismissed reports that Pakistan cricket team was a divided lot and insisted there was no groupism in the side. Afridi also said there was no dissension against skipper Shoaib Malik and coach Geoff Lawson. Media reports, just ahead of the tri-series final between India and Pakistan, had claimed that some senior players had daggers drawn against Malik and Lawson but Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Naseem Ashraf has already denied the report. ldquo;There are no groups in the team. Such stories are not correct. The chairman met us to buck us up and remind us of our duties and responsibilities, rdquo; Afridi said.  Tanvir rsquo;s view  Karachi: Left-arm pacer Sohail Tanvir on Monday rated Pakistan rsquo;s tri-series final victory against arch-rivals India as more valuable than the Indian Premier League title win, in which he played a key role. ldquo;Nothing can replace national pride. What I did in the IPL was a purely individual effort. I was happy that I was able to play a role and take Rajasthan Royals to a final win but being part of the Pakistan team in the final at Dhaka was more important, rdquo; said Tanvir. The wrong-footed bowler insisted that representing his country was much significant than playing in the IPL.  Dalmiya case  Mumbai: A Mumbai court on Monday deferred a case, filed by the BCCI against Jagmohan Dalmiya for allegedly misappropriating Rs 29 million from the Pilcom funds, to December 19. The decision paves the way for the former president to contest the CAB elections next month.   Dalmiya, however, thinks the case was not an impediment to contest the elections. ldquo;This was a regular course of hearing. The hurdle was never there, rdquo; he said.

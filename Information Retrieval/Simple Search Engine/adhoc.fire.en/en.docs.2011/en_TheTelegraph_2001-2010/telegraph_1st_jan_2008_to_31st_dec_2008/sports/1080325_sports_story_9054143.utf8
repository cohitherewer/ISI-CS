The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand loses to Aronian, slips to joint fourth
                                                   Anand loses to Aronian, slips to joint fourth
                      
	Nice: Viswanathan Anand suffered a 0.5-1.5 loss to leader Levon Aronian of Armenia in the eighth round of the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament.         
	Anand managed to draw his rapid game but ended up conceding a point in the blindfold, which cost him dear as he slipped to joint fourth in the overall standings.         
	The defeat means the gap between Anand and Aronian has widened. With just three rounds to go, Aronian is now on 10.5 points, a point ahead of Magnus Carlsen of Norway, who scored a resounding 2-0 victory over Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan.         
	Peter Leko of Hungary accounted for Loek van Wely of The Netherlands 1.5-0.5 to jump to third spot with nine points while Anand, Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and Alexander Morozevich of Russia are now joint fourth with 8.5 points each.         
	Anand now shares the seventh spot in the blindfold section with four points. Morozevich leads with 5.5 points.         
	The Indian, however, remained joint second with 4.5 points in the rapid section. Aronian has 6 points and a healthy 1.5 point lead. (PTI)

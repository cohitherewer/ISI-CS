                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev moves to tied 2nd, SSP out
                      
	Newport: Jeev Milkha Singh turned in a steady three-under 68 that earned him a share of the second spot even as three other Indians in fray missed the cut despite improved performances in the second round of the Celtic Manor Wales Open here.         
	Jeev, who was tied third overnight, now has a total of nine-under 133, just four strokes behind leader Australian Scott Strange (66).         
	However, it was curtains for Jyoti Randhawa (69), Indian Masters champion S.S.P. Chowrasia (70) and Shiv Kapur (71). The trio fell by the wayside despite returning improved cards with the cut coming at one-under.         
	While Kapur and Randhawa missed the cut by a stroke, Chowrasia fell short by two shots. But it was another good day for Jeev, who was off the blocks with a second-hole birdie. He picked up another stroke on the sixth but a bogey on the third hole saw him make the turn one-under.         
	Jeev shares the second spot with three others  Englishmen Robert Dinwiddie (65), Benn Barham (64) and Spaniard Alvaro Velasco (68).           (PTI)

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Day IV highlights
                      
	 England (302) bettered their previous highest score in Mohali. They had scored 300 in 2005-06.         
	 Harbhajan Singh now has 63 wickets in the calendar year. This equals his best performance in a calendar year. He had taken 63 wickets in 2002 as well. Only South Africas Dale Steyn (64 wkts) has taken more than Harbhajn this year.         
	 Virender Sehwag was run out only for the second time in his career spanning 114 innings. The only other instance being vs Pakistan in Bangalore, 2004-05         
	 Rahul Dravid scored the 8th duck of his career and his first against England. He has not recorded any ducks against West Indies, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Zimbabwe.         
	 It was the 15th instance of an Indian scoring a century and a duck in the same Test. Dravid is the 13th player to do so. Tendulkar and Vijay Manjrekar have the dubious distinction of doing so twice. Interestingly 6 of the 15 instances have been against England.         
	 The last Indian to score a century and a duck in a match was Virender Sehwag, also against England at Trent Bridge 2002.         
	 The last player to score a century and a duck in a Test match was Andrew Strauss vs New Zealand in Napier.           COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

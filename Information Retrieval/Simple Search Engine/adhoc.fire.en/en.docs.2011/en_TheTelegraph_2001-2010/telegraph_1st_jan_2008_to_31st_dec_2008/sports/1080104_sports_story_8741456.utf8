                                                   Steelers in last four 

           
	Chandigarh: Defending champions Orissa Steelers beat Sher-e-Jalandhar 2-0 on Thursday night to seal a semi-final berth in the Premier Hockey League (PHL). 
    
	Steelers will meet Bangalore Lions while Hyderabad Sultans  who were pushed to the fourth spot on goal difference  will take on local favourites Chandigarh Dynamos on Saturday. 
    
	With the Jalandhar team needing to win by a four-goal margin to make the cut, they started on a fast pace. But they couldnt sustain the tempo for too long. Their was very little support for Gagan Ajit Singh and Jarnail Singh upfront. 
    
	The Orissa outfit played to a plan and their defence, manned by Dilip Tirkey and Kim Chul, was rock solid. 
    
	William Xalxo assisted them well, while Birendra Lakra stood out in the midfield. Orissa Steelers shot ahead through a stunning field goal by Ignace Tirkey in the 22nd minute. 
    
	The second goal came 10 minutes into the final session. Roshan Minz passed to an unmarked Lakra, whose hit went in off the goalkeepers pads. 
    
	The Jalandhar men earned two short corners, but both went abegging. (PTI)

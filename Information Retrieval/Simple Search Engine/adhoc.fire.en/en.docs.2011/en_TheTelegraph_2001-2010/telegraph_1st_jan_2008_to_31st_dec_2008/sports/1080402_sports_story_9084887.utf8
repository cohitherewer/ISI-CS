                                                   Upbeat EB take on Al Wihdat 
            A CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Amman: After a 1-0 victory over Yemens Ahli Sanaa in their last encounter on home ground, city giants East Bengal are looking to continue the good work when they take on Jordanian league champions Al Wihdat in a crucial match here on Wednesday.         
	The Federation Cup champions, with three points from two matches, are second among four teams in group B behind Al Safa of Lebanon, who have bagged four from a win and a draw.         
	Al Wihdat, on the other hand, have two points from two games after a 1-1 away draw with Ahli Sanaa and a 3-3 draw at home against Al Safa.         
	A win over the Jordanian team would provide a major boost to East Bengals hopes of a quarter-final berth in Asias second tier club competition.         
	The winners of the six groups and two best runners-up will make into the last eight and the tournament will be played on knockout basis thereon.         
	With no injury problems in the squad, coach Aloke Mukherjee appeared confident that his side would get something out of the match since Al Wihdat are going through a lean patch recently.         
	There are no injury problems in my squad All the boys are fit and are confident of a good show tomorrow. We are not taking them lightly. We must gain one point and should play a cautious game And three points when they come to Calcutta will surely help us in the long run, said Mukherjee.         
	East Bengal really have little options of taking them lightly since the Jordan side features several players from the national squad and will always have the upperhand with the home advantage.         
	Meanwhile, in Margao, a keen and close contest is on the card as Bahrains Al Muharraq take on Dempo in the third round of the group A AFC Cup, at the Nehru Stadium on Wednesday.

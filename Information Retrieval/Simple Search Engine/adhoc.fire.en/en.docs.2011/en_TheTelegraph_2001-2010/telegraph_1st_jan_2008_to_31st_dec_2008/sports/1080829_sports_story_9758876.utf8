The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kallis to lead in   last three   ODIs
                                                                                                                                                                                           Kallis to lead in   last three   ODIs
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: Jacques Kallis will lead South Africa in the last three one-day Internationals against England after captain Graeme Smith was ruled out with an elbow injury on Thursday on the eve of the third one-dayer at the Oval.         
	It says a lot for Graeme the man and his dogged determination and courage that he has continued playing in spite of being in pain, remarked South Africa coach Mickey Arthur. In all honesty, he probably shouldnt have played after the series-winning Edgbaston Test.         
	We were hoping that we would get through the first few ODIs in a strong position and then possibly leave Graeme out of the last couple, but he has now reached the point of no return. He cant grip the bat with his right hand at the moment, Arthur explained.         
	Smith, however, took part in Thursdays fielding drill, taking some catches with his left hand. Physiotherapist Shane Jabaar has started treating Smith. The South Africa skipper aims to make a comeback in the ODI series against Kenya at the end of October, a team source said.         
	Kallis said he was looking forward to the job of captaincy.         
	It is something I enjoy although it is not always easy when coupled with the dual responsibility of being an allrounder. I have done it before at both ODI and Test match level and will be up for the challenge.         
	We have come back previously from being 0-2 down in a series (against Pakistan) and gone on to win 3-2 and that is what we will be aiming to achieve again, he added.         
	Kallis described the Nottingham defeat as unacceptable.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods superior to Nicklaus: Casper
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Woods superior to Nicklaus: Casper
                  Tiger Woods                     
	 Chicago: Tiger Woods is superior to Jack Nicklaus in two areas of the game, according to a fellow American golfing great, Billy Casper.         
	World No.1, Woods and 18 times major winner Nicklaus, whose career overlapped much of Caspers, are widely regarded as the greatest golfers of all time.         
	They both are just unbelievable players but Tiger has two ingredients which Jack Nicklaus didnt have, 66-year-old Casper told reporters on Monday at a media meet for the next months Buick Open where Woods is a twice champion.         
	The veteran golfer cited two reasons for Tigers excellence. One, Tiger has such a superior short game. Jacks short game, other than putting, was just a little above average. And two, Tigers imagination to play shots that nobody else has played, try to play those shots and then bring them off is just amazing. Jack didnt have that imagination.         
	A lot of us try to play those shots and once in a while we bring them off, added Casper, who was speaking at Warwick Hills Golf amp; Country Club in Grand Blanc, where the Buick Open would be staged from June 26-29.         
	But its fun to watch Tiger accomplish these shots, they just amaze everybody, the famed golfer said.         
	Casper, a three time major winner who piled up 51 titles in a glittering PGA Tour career, gave an example of Woods creativity from a recent Buick Invitational in San Diego.         
	In the final round, he hit it over the green, his third shot, caught a flier or something and the ball was sitting in the muck and the grass, recalled Casper who was considered the best putter of his era.         
	And one of the commentators said, well, hell be lucky to hit the green. The other one said, if he gets it within 30 feet, itll be a miracle.         
	Well, Tiger hit the shot and he put it about a foot from the hole. He just is an incredible individual.         
	Woods, a 13 times major champion, won the Buick Open in 2002 and 2006.           (REUTERS)

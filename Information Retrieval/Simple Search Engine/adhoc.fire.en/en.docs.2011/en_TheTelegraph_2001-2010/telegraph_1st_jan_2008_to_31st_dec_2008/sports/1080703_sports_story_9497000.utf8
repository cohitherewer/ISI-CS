                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dalmiya confirms contesting polls 
            A STAFF REPORTER                                Dalmiya      
	Calcutta: Its finally official. Former Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya will contest in the forthcoming CAB elections later this month.         
	Yes, I will contest, Dalmiya confirmed on Wednesday night.         
	I had to give in to the pressure of the members. They wanted me back at the CAB... But I would like to officially announce the decision a few days later I dont want to hurry things, Dalmiya added.         
	On Wednesday, about 35 CAB members went to Dalmiyas office and finally managed to convince him to contest the ensuing elections.         
	It was a tough job to persuade him. He was not at all ready to contest But at last we managed to convince him and he agreed to our request, former CAB assistant secretary Biswarup Dey said.         
	Dalmiya, however, was cautious of his chances. I decided to contest only after they pressurised me I dont want to comment anything now Let me settle down, he said.         
	CAB president Prasun Mukherjee was confident of winning. He (Dalmiya) is always welcome to contest. But I am confident... My achievements will speak for me I need no campaigning, Mukherjee said.         
	Meanwhile former India opener W.V. Raman, who had a meeting with CAB officials on taking over as Bengal coach, will decide in a couple of weeks.         
	Its not final... We have to wait for his decision. Raman has cited some family problems and will let us know about his decision within two weeks, Mukherjee said.         
	It was, however, learnt that the meeting was fruitful and Raman will return to the city shortly to sign the contract.

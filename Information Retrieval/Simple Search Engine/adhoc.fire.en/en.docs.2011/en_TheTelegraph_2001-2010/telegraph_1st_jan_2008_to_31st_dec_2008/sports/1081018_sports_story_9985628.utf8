	The third day of the chess world championship finally saw the first blood drawn when defending champion Viswanathan Anand displayed his exemplary skills in all parts of the game to score a brilliant win over challenger Vladimir Kramnik in what can be called the best game of the year 2008.         
	Kramnik began the game with the Queens gambit, which Anand declined by opting for the Slav defence, the opening he had employed in the very first game. Kramnik did not repeat the exchange variation again but he chose the main line of the defence, which he had successfully employed against Vasselin Topalov in their world championship match.         
	Anand, who is well aware of Kramniks mastery in the main line, showed great wisdom in avoiding what the Bulgarian had chosen and actually went for the sharp Meran variation, which he had successfully employed against Alexander Khaliman. Meran is a double-edged opening wherein a single mistake in the opening can land a player in a hopeless position. Anands opening choice clearly indicated that he was out for a kill today (Friday).         
	On move 14, Anand came up with an interesting pawn sacrifice, which can be called as an important theoretical novelty. Though this move had been played twice before in amateur play in 2006, it had remained unknown to the chess world all along. The challenger accepted the challenge  the sacrificed pawn  and started defending cautiously. Anands 15th move with his King bishop was actually the new move. On the sixteenth move, Anand placed his King rook in an open file, directly aiming against the enemy King. All this clearly looked like home preparation as he had consumed only 10 minutes at this stage while Kramnik had spent over half an hour.         
	The challenger immediately sensed danger to his King and took another 40 minutes for the next three moves. However, he certainly made good use of his time, since he came up with a brilliant piece sacrifice on move 18 followed by another on move 19, which led to direct threats to Anands king. It was now Anands turn to sink into deep thought.                   Viswanathan Anand      
	He found out the only way to defend with a King march and could have forced a draw on move 22. However, he correctly decided to play for a win by giving back all his extra material to exchange Kramniks powerful rook. By move 24, the challenger emerged with two extra-connected Pawns on the Queen side but was left with a badly exposed homeless King in return. Despite reduced material Anand, resumed his attack fiercely forcing Kramniks king to run away from the danger zone for asylum. However, Anands center control and powerfully placed Queen enabled him to attack the enemy king at all destinations.         
	By this time both players were in severe time trouble. On move 33, Anand missed an immediate mate but the move chosen by him was also adequate as it won the enemy Queen for a rook. Kramnik lost a bishop as well but played till move 41 before surrendering.         
	With this crushing victory, Anand made it very clear that when it comes to attack and initiative, he is the best.

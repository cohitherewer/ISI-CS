The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger wins, Andy withdraws 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Roger wins, Andy withdraws 
                  Roger Federer in Ohio on Tuesday                     
	Ohio: Roger Federer was relieved to shake off last weeks early round loss in Toronto and beat Robby Ginepri 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-0 Tuesday in his first match at the Cincinnati Masters.         
	Im happy Im back with a one-match winning streak, Federer joked. Im happy I could turn it around today. Andy Roddick wasnt so fortunate.         
	The sixth-seeded American withdrew just before his match with Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany was to begin, citing neck and shoulder pain.         
	Roddick asked for the public address microphone and told spectators that he didnt think he could get through his match and withdrew to allow another player to compete. Jun Woong-sun of South Korea took his place.         
	Ginepri was 0-4 against the top-ranked Swiss going into the match, but pressured him through two sets until Federer wore him down and Ginepri began missing with his first serve.         
	The American said he had trouble breathing and had a stomach ache  which he chalked up to nerves that got worse as the match progressed.         
	I feel 100 percent better than I did on the court, he said after lying down for 10 minutes after the match.         
	The $2.6 million ATP Western amp; Southern Financial Group Masters is Federers second tournament since having his         
	Wimbledon title streak broken by second-ranked Rafael Nadal. A week ago, Federer was ousted from the Toronto Masters in the second round, and his No. 1 ranking would have been in danger if that had happened again this week.         
	Nadal could still overtake Federer if the Spaniard wins the Cincinnati title and the Swiss loses before the semi-finals.         
	On center court just before the Federer match, Carlos Moya of Spain beat Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia 7-6 (7-5), 7-5.         
	In other matches, Florent Serra of France rallied to beat Benjamin Becker of Germany 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.         
	Arnaud Clement of France beat Thomas Johansson of Sweden 7-6 (4), 6-7 (5-7), 6-3; John Isner beat Andrea Stoppini of Italy 7-6 (7-2), 6-3.         
	While 11th-seeded Richard Gasquet of France beat countryman Michael Llodra, who retired in the third set with an injury to his left arm.         
	Tenth-seeded Fernando Verdasco of Spain beat Victor Estrella, the first player from the Dominican Republic to play in an ATP tournament, 6-3, 7-5.         
	Robin Soderling of Sweden eliminated 12th-seeded Tommy Robredo of Spain 7-6 (8-6), 6-3.           (AP)

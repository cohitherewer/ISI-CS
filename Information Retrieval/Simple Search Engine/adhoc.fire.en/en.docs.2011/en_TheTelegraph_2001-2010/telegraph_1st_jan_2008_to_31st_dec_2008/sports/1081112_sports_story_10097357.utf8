The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia: Still no growth at the domestic level 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bhutia: Still no growth at the domestic level 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia feels that the recent success of the national team hasnt really helped the game to grow at the domestic level.         
	Things are certainly looking up at the international level after our victories in the Nehru Cup and the AFC Challenge Cup but I am yet to find many changes locally, Bhutia told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	Have you found any new infrastructure coming up in the last one year, asked Bhutia, who has been captain for the last nine years.         
	 Have you found any change that would help the game spread across the country? Not yet. The game at the domestic level is still not being managed in the manner it should be. The number of spectators is receding in the I-League, said the ace striker.         
	Bhutia made it clear that things would not improve unless a genuine youth development programme (YDP) is started.         
	In Europe, the clubs play a major role in nurturing new talent through their developmental schemes. Here, there is no as such programme and I dont blame the clubs for it, Bhutia said.         
	In the professional system, young players could be an investment. The clubs can make money by selling them. But no such system exists in India. I see hardly any reason why the clubs should spend money on building up age-group teams. They will gain nothing, he said.         
	The Mohun Bagan player said it would not be a bad idea to have an India B side along with the national team.         
	In some other countries, the under-21 team play a match a day before the national team are scheduled to play. We can follow that trend to provide exposure to the youngsters but clubs may not like to release the footballers, he said.         
	Bhutia also said that footballers are neglected.         
	The players are not always looked after in a proper manner. I dont want to be specific at the moment but there are several instances when footballers have been the victims of the system and no one came around to rescue them.         
	Bhutias main complaint is against the faulty contract system that is loaded against the players.         
	Some of the laws are ridiculous, said Bhutia. For example, I may enter into a two or three-year contract with a club in Calcutta but in the IFA office, the form that I will sign will only be for a particular season. If there is a dispute about the duration, the club will produce the letter of contract. No one will then bother to check the IFA records.         
	Bhutia said that he had met authorities both at the state and the national level to point out many other discrepancies like this but so far no significant change has been made in the footballers favour.

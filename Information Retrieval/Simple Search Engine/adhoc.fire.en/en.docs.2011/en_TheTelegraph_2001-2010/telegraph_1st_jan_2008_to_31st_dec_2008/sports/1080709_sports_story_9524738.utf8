The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proteas pin hopes on pace duo

	London: South Africa will target Englands vulnerable middle order in the opening match of the four-Test series starting at Lords on Thursday.         
	At a news conference on Tuesday, coach Mickey Arthur said the South Africans thought Ian Bell at number five and Paul Collingwood one place lower would be under pressure.         
	Neither batsman was convincing in the recent three-Test series against New Zealand, won 2-0 by England, nor in the following one-day series which the Kiwis won 3-1.         
	In addition Collingwood, the England one-day captain, was banned for four matches when his team failed to bowl their overs in the allocated period for the second time within a year while he was in charge.         
	Firing the opening salvos in the propaganda war before a keenly awaited series, Arthur said the England pace bowlers would also be aware that allrounder Andrew Flintoff would return to the side at some stage once he proved his fitness.         
	I think at five and six, those two players will be under some pressure going into this series, Arthur said.         
	I think the Flintoff factor lingers over, hes too good a player not to play, hes got to come back for somebody, theres going to be somebody unlucky.         
	So I think within the whole pressure cooker of Test cricket there might be one or two little personal contests going on in the England side as well which are going to create their own little pressure, create their own dynamic.         
	If we can get into five and six when the ball is pretty new that will be good and I think theres going to be one bowler bowling with a cloud over him knowing Flintoff might be fit for the second Test match.         
	South Africa are pinning their hopes on an exciting young pace duo of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel, backed by the experienced Makhaya Ntini and supplemented by allrounder Jacques Kallis.         
	We went for three bowlers, for three strikers. We are very lucky that we have got Jacques Kallis who is obviously a quality allrounder, hes like a 12th player for us because he bats in your top four and he obviously bowls in your top four if you like, Arthur said.         
	He can do a holding role for us, he can swing it, he can do anything we ask of him.         
	Heavy showers and strong winds buffeted London again on Tuesday and the forecast is not good for the remainder of the week.         
	I was pretty grumpy about it because we had planned a big day today. But after our training today Im very, very happy to say we got out of it exactly what we wanted, Arthur said.         
	We had some good practice in the indoor school and our bowlers were able to get outdoors in the Nursery Ground.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McEnroe: Mens game a cut above
                                                                                                                                                                                                       McEnroe: Mens game a cut above

	Kuala Lumpur: Tennis great John McEnroe says the mens game has completely eclipsed the womens over the past five years on the personality front.         
	The controversial American, in Kuala Lumpur to play an exhibition game with old rival Bjorn Borg, Roger Federer and James Blake, pointed to Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic as crowd-pleasers.         
	But he had few examples to give on the womens side. Personally, I think over the last five years the mens game has totally eclipsed the womens game as far as personalities go.         
	A lot of women have retired. Obviously the Williams sisters, when they are motivated, are probably the two best players in the world and create interest. But theres more personality among the men.         
	I think it was disguised for a while because they thought it was getting out of control with the likes of me and (Jimmy) Connors.         
	But nowadays, I think at the US Open you saw a lot of emotion come out of Roger, showing a side you hadnt seen as much, and theres Nadal, Murray, Djokovic and even (Jo-Wilfried) Tsonga, for example.         
	Theres a number of players who I think actually show quite a bit of personality.         
	McEnroe, who won seven Grand Slam singles titles during his career and now works as a television commentator, said it boded well for the future, with all those players still relatively young.         
	I think the game is on a real upswing and we should try to ride that, he said. We have come off what was perhaps the greatest match I ever saw when Roger played Nadal at Wimbledon and so I think were in a good position to take advantage of that.         
	Id like to see all that translate into a surge in popularity. Im real hopeful about the next five, 10 years.         
	The second-ranked Federer rallied from 1-3 down to win 7-6 (10-7) in a championship tiebreaker in Kuala Lumpur. In another singles match, McEnroe beat Borg 7-6 (13-11). Federer and Borg then teamed up to play McEnroe and Blake in doubles, and the Americans won 7-5.         
	He was also ranked the World No. 1 in doubles for a record 257 weeks. He has nine Grand Slam mens doubles titles, and one Grand Slam mixed doubles title.         
	He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1999.         
	After a 12-year absence from the professional tour, McEnroe returned to top-level doubles competition in 2006 at San Jose. He won the doubles title there with Jonas Bjorkman becoming, at 47 years and three days, the oldest player to win a top-level title in 30 years.

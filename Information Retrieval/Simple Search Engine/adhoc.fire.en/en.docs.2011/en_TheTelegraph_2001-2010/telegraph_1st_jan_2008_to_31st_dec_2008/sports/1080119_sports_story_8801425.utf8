                                                    Laxman: Always had faith in those coming down the order

      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
               
	Perth: Thanks to V.V.S. Laxmans quality 79, under pressure, Team India could reach 294 in the second innings of the fascinating third Test at the Waca. 
    
	After stumps on Friday (Day III), Laxman had a Q amp;A session at the Waca itself and, briefly, spoke to The Telegraph at the Hyatt Regency.
 
	The following are excerpts
 
	On the state of the Test
 
	The Australians will be under a lot of pressure tomorrow (Saturday)... The way our bowlers bowled today, getting the remaining 348 wont be easy...
 
	On scripting telling knocks in the second innings
 
	Its not about second or first... Fact is that I enjoy challenges, whether its for India, South Zone or Hyderabad... Whenever the team is under pressure, the situation brings the best out of me... The satisfaction is more when I perform in such situations, more than when I get hundreds. 
 
	On whether, having thrown it away in the first innings (after scoring 27), he was more determined not to give anything away in the second
 
	Well, yes, but I wasnt thinking of the first innings this afternoon...
 
	On where would he rate his innings of 79
 
	As one of my best... More than individual performances, if we win tomorrow, then that will be a great moment for all of us... However, instead of the result, I think all the boys will be focusing on the process.
 
	On whether, with the help of the lower order, hed expected to take the score from 125 for five to 294
 
	When I went in to bat (at No. 7), I didnt look at the bigger picture... The only thing that was on my mind was to build partnerships... Irfan (Pathan) and I put together an important partnership and, then, I had one with (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and RP (Singh)... My partnership with Irfan was critical and helped bring the momentum back in our favour.
 
	On his thoughts when the sixth wicket (Pathans) fell at 160
 
	The target was to get Australia to chase more than 400... That would challenge Australia psychologically too.
 
	On the support he received from Dhoni and RP
 
	Dhoni played a very mature innings... In the last six-seven months hes played some really good knocks for the country, especially in the second innings at Lords... He hung in there instead of playing in his free style... Dhoni played for the team and according to the situation... RPs effort was really commendable... He showed amazing determination.
 
	On whether it was a conscious decision that RP would be shielded from Brett Lee
 
	(Smiles) Yes... RP was comfortable facing Shaun Tait and Stuart Clark... Ive always had faith in our lower order... The way RP played today and the way Ishant (Sharma) batted in Sydney...
 
	On batting with the tail
 
	One has to go by the situation... One also has to take the partner into account... As Ive said, Ive always had faith in those coming down the order.
 
	On whether the pressure eased when Ricky Ponting introduced spin by way of Michael Clarke and Andrew Symonds
 
	Im sure Ponting had a strategy and there was bounce when Clarke bowled... The strategy didnt pay off, though.
 
	On Lee
 
	Hes bowling in wicket-taking areas and is high on confidence.
 
	On Tait, who was to have been an impact bowler
 
	I think he bowled well... Sometimes, the plans of the captains go haywire...
 
	On the role that awaits Anil Kumble
 
	Hell have a very important role tomorrow... Anil bowled just one over this evening, but one could see the extra bounce he generated.
 
	On the need for our bowlers not to get carried away
      
	(Bowling coach) Venkatesh Prasad has been working on that and, then, weve got a mature captain in Anil... Im sure our bowlers can take the pressure (of bowling out Australia)... Theyve matured as this tour has progressed.
 
	On Pathans all-round contribution
 
	Hes having a great Test... Hes been outstanding.
 
	On the state of the wicket
 
	Three or four length-balls kept a little low, but that wont worry batsmen.
 
	Finally, whether hes hurt at not getting the attention which most of the other senior pros have been receiving
 
	(Grins) No... Ive never thought on those lines... I just do my job to the best of my ability.

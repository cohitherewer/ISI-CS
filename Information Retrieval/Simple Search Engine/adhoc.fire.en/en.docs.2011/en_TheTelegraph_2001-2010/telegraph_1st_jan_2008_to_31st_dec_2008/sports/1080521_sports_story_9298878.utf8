The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | As its Moscow, it must be Chelsea

	Visit Russia before they visit you, was the apocryphal tagline for the Russian tourist board during the Cold War.         
	Within months of the World War II finishing, the Russians visited London in 1945 and were welcomed by a crowd estimated to be between 80,000-100,000 people (including my grandmother and grandfather) on a November evening in west London. They came in the form of Moscow Dynamo and visited Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea in a friendly match.         
	The game ended in a 3-3 draw after Chelsea led by two goals and started with the Moscow side walking out across the old dog track, which, on the night, acted as an overspill for thousands of fans, and on to the pitch carrying small bunches of flowers.         
	Tommy Lawton, who only months earlier had joined Chelsea from Everton for the princely sum of 14,000, which wouldnt buy the services of a Premiership journeyman today for one week, recalled the Russian skills on display that night. Only when there was a clear run to goal did the Dynamo really whirl into action, then seven men converged like destroyers on the opposing goal, he said.         
	10 years later, Chelsea won their first league title under the shrewd management of Ted Drake, who, as my friends who support other London clubs from that vintage regularly remind me, was asked by the FA not to challenge for the first edition of the European Cup the following season because they were not deemed to be good enough.         
	Chelsea had, after all, won the championship with the smallest number of points before or since.         
	Last December was the 40th anniversary of my first visit to Stamford Bridge. It was an auspicious start, Chelsea beating Arsenal over a Christmas fixture. I can also remember the disappointment of my family, all lifelong Chelsea fans, sitting around a black and white television set earlier that year when the Blues were involved in the first London FA Cup Final against Tottenham. A damp squid of a match that Spurs won 2-1.         
	By the time Chelsea reached the FA Cup Final against Leeds in 1970, my home was in Sheffield. Admitting my football affiliation in an inner-city secondary modern probably did as much to hone my turn of speed as the carefully choreographed training sessions of my father and coach.         
	The following year, as Cup winners, Chelsea reached their first European final in Athens and, like the year before, it took a replay before the club showed off their second major trophy from an open-topped bus through the streets of Fulham.         
	Goals by John Dempsey and the legendary Peter Osgood  who, in his biography, admitted he was barely sober before the replay  were enough to edge past Real Madrid.         
	The game in Athens took place in the Karaiskakis Stadium, which, four years later, was the venue for my first championship medal in the European juniors. Chelseas second European Cup Winners Cup title was against Stuttgart, the city in which I won my European senior title, and, on May 21, Chelsea take on the magnificent Manchester United in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, the scene of my tussles with Steve Ovett in the 1980 Games.         
	The science of this theory, I recognise, is unlikely to keep Sir Alex Ferguson awake at night or colour his team talk. But it seems perfectly obvious to me - our name is on the cup.

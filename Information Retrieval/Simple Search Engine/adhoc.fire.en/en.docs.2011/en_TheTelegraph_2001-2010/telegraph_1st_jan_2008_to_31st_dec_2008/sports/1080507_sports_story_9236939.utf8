	Colombo: Rumeli Dhar shone both with the bat and ball as three-time champions India spanked Bangladesh by five wickets to set up a summit clash with Sri Lanka in the womens Asia Cup.         
	India overcame a minor hiccup to maintain their unbeaten run in the tournament while Sri Lanka prevailed over Pakistan by 45 runs for their third victory in four matches.         
	The defeats left Bangladesh and Pakistan fight for the wooden spoon with two league matches remaining.         
	Sundays final between India and Sri Lanka will be the third time that the two teams facing each other in the finals. India however, emerged winners on both the previous occasions.         
	Chasing 161 for win, India were reduced to 86 for four and then 107 for five but Karuna Jain (33 not out) and ICCs women cricketer of the year Jhulan Goswami (23 not out) put up a match-winning unbroken 54-run partnership to steer India out of the woods. Rumeli contributed 31.         
	Earlier, Bangladesh captain Salma Khatun hit a polished 90 off 140 balls to help Bangladesh put up 160 for nine. (PTI)

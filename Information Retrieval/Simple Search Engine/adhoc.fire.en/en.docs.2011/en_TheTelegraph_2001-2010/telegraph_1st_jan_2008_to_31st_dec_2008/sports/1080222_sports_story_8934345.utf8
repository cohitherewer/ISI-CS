The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AC Milan keep Arsenal at bay
                                                     AC Milan keep Arsenal at bay
  - Wengers side have task cut out in away tie while its advantage for Fergusons boys       HENRY WINTER            Emmanuel Adebayor (top) and Alessandro Nesta during their Champions League match on Wednesday. (Reuters)                                 
	London: This time, the Italians held on. This time, the master-class in defending from visiting Serie A experts was flawless. AC Milan on Wednesday night managed what Inter had failed to do 24 hours earlier at Liverpool, defending superbly for 90 minutes rather than 86. Paolo Maldini, 39 going on 19, was magnificent.         
	Beginning at left-back, finishing at centre-half, Maldini was applauded from the field by the Londoners fans after frustrating an Arsenal side still smarting from their weekend thrashing in the FA Cup.         
	Arsenals players had been determined to remind everyone of their class following Saturdays humiliation by Manchester United. On returning from Old Trafford, William Gallas had called a team meeting and delivered a few home truths to players whom the captain admitted were very ashamed at the 0-4 reverse.         
	If Wayne Rooneys role as Uniteds spearhead had alarmed Gallas and Kolo Toure, they now faced another nimble frontrunner in Pato, the Brazilian nicknamed the Duck, who was supported by Kaka and Clarence Seedorf in Milans 4-3-2-1 formation. Arsenal soon lost Toure, who limped away with a knee injury, bringing in Philippe Senderos to deal with the teenaged Pato.         
	Wenger also drilled his players in the importance of closing down the space around Andrea Pirlo, Milans tempo-setter. Using a 4-4-1-1 system, Wenger put Alexander Hleb in the hole behind Emmanuel Adebayor with special Pirlo duties.         
	Midway through a first half more akin to a chess contest of move and counter-move, Hleb pressurised Pirlo into surrendering the ball which fell kindly for Adebayor. As Arsenal suddenly sped upfield, with Hleb and Adebayor leading the charge, only the awareness of Maldini rescued Milan.         
	With Alessandro Nesta and Kakha Kaladze seeking to shackle the Togo international with typical Serie A diligence, Arsenal soon looked for runners from midfield. Flamini, who is enjoying such a fine season, collected a delayed pass from Emmanuel Eboue and sent a low shot through on goal. Milans Australian keeper, Zeljko Kalac, saved with ease.         
	Arsenal fans believed the white blanket thrown across Milans box could be ripped away. A wriggling run from Hleb set up Eboue, who wastefully side-footed his shot wide. Then Adebayor arrived in the box, racing on to the ball, only for Kalac to meet it fractionally before him.         
	Still Arsenal came. Eduardo fired over but the Croatian international then let Massimo Oddo get away from him down the other end. Eduardo was relieved when the Italian full-back shovelled his shot into the crowd.         
	Maldini was rolling back the years. Now at centre-half, Milans captain and enduring symbol showed all his experience in guiding Fabregass driven pass away from Adebayor. Milans main men were beginning to show, Kaka briefly threatening Jens Lehmanns goal. Another dart by Kaka was halted crudely by a trip from Senderos, who was deservedly cautioned.         
	Wenger attempted to enliven his attack, sending on Nicklas Bendtner for Eduardo, pushing Hleb to the left and employing a more orthodox 4-4-2 approach. Frustration seeped into Arsenal minds. Flamini even let rip at the prostrate Pato, accusing the Brazilian of time-wasting when the youngster was poleaxed by cramp.         
	Arsenal sought every route through to Kalacs goal, even illegal ones. Eboue was cautioned for diving over Marek Jankulovskis challenge. The huge potential that lies in Eboues feet is let down time after time by the absence of anything between the ears.         
	Still Arsenal believed, and when Hleb cut the ball back to Bendtner, the Emirates stood in hope. Alas, the Dane fired over.         
	Wengers side must now travel to Maldinis back-yard, expecting another tight game but knowing how valuable an away goal will be. Maldini will have other ideas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coach needs a break, Ranty eyes Europe
                                                   Coach needs a break, Ranty eyes Europe
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	New Delhi: Helping Dempo to a fairytale triumph in the inaugural ONGC I-League on Saturday, coach Armando Colaco said he needed a break.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from Kozhikode on Saturday, the Dempo coach said: There is very little left to achieve in Indian football now. I have won everything and I need a well-deserved break.         
	Under Armando, Dempo have won the NFL (now the I-League) thrice, the Federation Cup and the Durand Cup.         
	Armando, considered Indias most successful coach in recent times, said it was a pressure job and he found it at times difficult to handle. Of late, I have also developed some health problems. I should take a break for a year and return afresh.         
	I will talk to the chairman (Srinivas Dempo) on Sunday and ask him to give me a years break. My injury is another concern. I need to take proper care or may end up on crutches for the rest of my life.         
	The Dempo coach appeared overwhelmed after clinching a 4-1 win over Viva Kerala. Someday I may write a book on how we won the I-League. The team played its normal game, he said. My boys were shaken up after Viva scored one (at 2-1), but they regrouped and came out strongly. I am proud of them.         
	Dempo, who led 3-1 at the half time, opened the scoring through Man of the Match Edeh Chidi in the 27th minute. Ranty Martins doubled the lead four minutes later through a spot kick after rival custodian Purushothaman was penalised for a foul on Nicolau Borges.         
	In the 35th minute, the hosts pulled one back through Saleel, but two more goals from Chidi and Beto put the issue beyond Viva Keralas reach.         
	Like Armando, Dempo captain Ranty, too, plans to bid adieu to the club at the end of the season.         
	I am not sure whether I will be around in India next season, the Nigerian striker said after the match. It has been a wonderful time in Dempo winning three NFL titles, the Federation Cup and the Durand Cup. Now its the time to look ahead.         
	Martins, whose contract with Dempo comes to an end within the next two months, is exploring options in Europe. I believe my European dram will come true.         
	While Armando had said he was relaxed on the eve of the crucial match, Martins admitted the team was under pressure. The pressure was immense Especially since we won just once in the last six matches, he said. It helped to get the best out of us.            Dempo players celebrate after winning the ONGC I- League in Kozhikode on Saturday.

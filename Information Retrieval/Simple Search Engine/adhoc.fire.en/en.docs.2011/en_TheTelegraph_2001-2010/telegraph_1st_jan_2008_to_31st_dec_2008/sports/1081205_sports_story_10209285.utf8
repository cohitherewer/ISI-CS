The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal mull playing 2 spinners vs Assam
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bengal mull playing 2 spinners vs Assam
  - Crucial Ranji Trophy match starts today       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Manoj Tiwarys return to form is good news for Bengal                                 
	Guwahati: A confident Bengal are likely to field an additional spinner in their Ranji Trophy encounter against hosts Assam at the NF Railway Stadium in Maligaon here from Friday.         
	Left-arm spinner Iresh Saxena could join Ritam Kundu, who has been Bengals lone spinner so far after Sourasish Lahiri was ruled out with an injury at the start of the season.         
	Bengals stand-in coach-cum-chief selector Sambaran Banerjee hinted at playing two spinners after a look at the track, which is likely to assist spin from the second day.         
	Itll be a good toss to win here. The wicket is going to turn from the second day and it will be a result-oriented match, Sambaran observed.         
	The visitors have 13 points from three matches, while Assam have 10 from an equal number of matches.         
	A win for Bengal would almost ensure their qualification for the knockout stage, while a victory for the hosts will keep them firmly in the hunt for qualification.         
	Assam enjoy a slight edge as they are playing at home and also have a strong spin attack but that is neutralised by Bengals strong pace attack and an experienced batting line-up comprising skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Rohan Banerjee, Manoj Tiwary and Wriddhiman Saha. Then there is the pace trio of Ashok Dinda, Ranadeb Bose and Sourav Sarkar, who could be more than effective in the morning when the track is generally favourable to pacers.         
	Though the visitors had a three-hour net session and appeared quite happy with the form and fitness of the players, they were disappointed with the choice of venue. I dont understand why the match is being held in Maligaon when they have a nice ground at the Nehru Stadium where they hold all the internationals, remarked Bengal consultant Mohinder Amarnath.         
	The match is being held at Maligaon as the Nehru Stadium had been booked for the Lokapriya Bordoloi Trophy football tournament from December 1. But it was subsequently deferred by 15 days in view of the ongoing Federation Cup.         
	Assam are unlikely to disturb the spin trio of Arlen Konwar, Swarupam Purkayastha and Anand Katti, who played key roles in Assams win against Vidarbha in their last match.         
	Its a vital game. We will go for full points from it. Our boys are quite confident about delivering their best, Assam coach Gursharan Singh said after the nets on Thursday.         
	The only worry for the two teams would be completing the full quota of 90 overs as the sun sets quite early in this part of the country.         
	TEAMS

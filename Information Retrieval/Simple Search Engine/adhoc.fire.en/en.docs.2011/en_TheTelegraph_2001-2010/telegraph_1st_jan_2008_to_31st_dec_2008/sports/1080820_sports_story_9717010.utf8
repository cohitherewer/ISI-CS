The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC is firm, so too is ACA
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ICC is firm, so too is ACA
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Will Ricky Ponting be seen in Pakistan?                           
	Calcutta/London: Even as the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Tuesday that they will go ahead with the Champions Trophy in Pakistan, The Australian quoted Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) chief executive Paul Marsh as saying that the players have refused to participate.         
	The newspaper quoted Marsh as saying: The ACA has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour Pakistan for the Champions Trophy.         
	We feel for the Pakistan Cricket Board and the people of Pakistan but it is the job of the ACA to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour. Unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe, Marsh said.         
	The unwavering stance from the games leading cricket team follows an angry reaction from the New Zealand players to an ICC taskforce last week. Sources in London claim there was an equally adverse reaction from the England players at a meeting with ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat in Edinburgh on Sunday night, the paper claimed.         
	When an ICC spokesman was contacted by The Telegraph late on Tuesday, he said: As of now, the tournament is going ahead in Pakistan, but the discussions with the participating teams is an ongoing process and the feedback from Cricket Australia should be discussed by the top-most officials on Wednesday.         
	Lorgat said that the Champions Trophy in Pakistan will be cancelled rather than relocated if security and safety conditions deteriorate significantly.         
	Sri Lanka has been suggested as a possible alternative for the eight-team one-day tournament starting on September 12.         
	I think the time has passed, Lorgat said on a visit to London to discuss security concerns with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).I think we have got to a position where it is very difficult to do it at a level which we are used to.         
	Earlier, Lorgat told a news conference at a hotel near Lords after a morning meeting with the ECB that there had been a lot of speculation about security in Pakistan.         
	As far as the ICC is concerned the safety and security is satisfactory, he said. We certainly feel confident about the safety and security aspect of the tournament.         
	The onus is on us to convince all those who have different perceptions.         
	The teams have not withdrawn and we expect the best teams to participate. I would like to think the member boards would not send weakened sides because no life is lesser than another.         
	Lorgat said he had spoken to members of the England one-day side on Sunday and would travel to his native South Africa this week for further talks.         
	The advice we have got on the current situation is that the status quo remains unchanged  if anything its a step in the right direction, Lorgat said.

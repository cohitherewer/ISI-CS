The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo best in Europe
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ronaldo best in Europe
            Henry Winter                      
	When considering the evidence for the European Footballer of the Year honour announced Tuesday morning, the case for Cristiano Ronaldo had appeared irresistible for those who follow the Premier League and Champions League closely. Fernando Torres and Lionel Messi offered strong claims to the Ballon dOr but, for this member of the voting panel, Ronaldo stood out.         
	When France Football magazine requested the voting of the two-man English jury, I had no hesitation in joining the esteemed London-based television journalist Max Marquis, a veteran observer of the English game, in casting the maximum five points for Ronaldo.         
	After Ronaldo, we awarded four points to Torres, three to Messi, two to Iker Casillas and one to Cesc Fabregas. But dominating our thoughts was a player who has enriched so many games, scored so many goals and made so many children fall in love with football. Ronaldo is special.         
	From an astonishing free-kick against Portsmouth in the Premier League to imperious headers against Roma and Chelsea in the Champions League, Manchester Uniteds magnificent winger is worth the admission fee like no other. Of course, entries did need recording in the debit column, not least Ronaldos irritating flirtation with Real Madrid, a (waning) propensity to dive, occasional dissent and failure to match Wayne Rooneys team-minded selflessness, but the creaking crate-load of positives outweighed the small kit-bag of negatives.         
	In seeking to become the first United player to win the Ballon dOr since George Best 40 years ago, Ronaldo seems the very model of the modern footballer, exuding pace, athleticism, balance, height and muscle. He is dedicated to his craft; as previous United No.7s such as David Beckham and Eric Cantona showed, practice made perfect and Ronaldos success with free-kicks is testament to the hours on the training ground.         
	Ronaldo has matured under Sir Alex Ferguson, unleashing his speed more intelligently and releasing the ball more effectively. He can play left or right, even through the middle and for someone so associated with delivering superb crosses, he is a commanding figure in the air (although Mr Versatility should leave catching corners to goalkeepers). Ferguson even described Ronaldos towering header against Roma last season, when he rose, somehow hung in the air before meeting the cross as a throwback to Tommy Lawton, Tony Hateley or Wyn Davies. His header in Moscow was equally good.         
	This was a strong year for the Ballon dOr, with certain stars carrying their club form into Euro 2008, particularly Spaniards like Torres, Casillas and Fabregas, while Argentinas little magician Messi has been in sensational form for Barcelona.         
	Barcelona produced some exceptional candidates, and Xavi and Andres Iniesta were both considered by the English jury, but Messi deserved our three points for the way he glides forward with the ball almost mesmerised by his clever feet.         
	Also attracting some points from the English jury were Casillas, such a safe pair of hands for Real Madrid and Spain, and Fabregas, the heartbeat of Arsenal and, for the latter part of Euro 2008, of Spain. The Ballon dOr will be presented next Sunday.   
	MEMORABLE MOMENTS OF MAGICAL YEAR  
	Jan. 30: Free-kick vs Portsmouth
   Ronaldo started the year in style, making headlines with a gravity-defying free-kick against Portsmouth which left David James rooted to the spot and United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in raptures. ldquo;It was the best free-kick I rsquo;ve ever seen, rdquo; Ferguson said.  
	May 21: Winning the Champions League
   Ronaldo soared above Michael Essien to meet Wes Brown rsquo;s cross and head his 42nd goal of the season. Petr Cech saved Ronaldo rsquo;s penalty in shoot-out, but he was saved any shame when United won nonetheless.   
	Summer '08: Turning down Real Madrid
   After a summer of intense speculation, which Ronaldo did nothing to diminish, the winger opted to remain at Old Trafford.   THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

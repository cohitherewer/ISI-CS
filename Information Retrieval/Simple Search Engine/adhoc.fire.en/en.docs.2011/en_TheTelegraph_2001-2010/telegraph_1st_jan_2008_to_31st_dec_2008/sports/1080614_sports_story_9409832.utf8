The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punjab in title round
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Punjab in title round
            JAYDEEP BASU            Action during the Punjab-Karnataka Santosh Trophy tie in Srinagar on Friday. (AP)                           
	Srinagar: It will be Punjab versus Services in the Santosh Trophy final on Sunday. In the second semi-final, defending champions Punjab scored a dramatic 4-3 victory over Karnataka in the tie-breaker after the regulation period and the extra-time failed to produce any goal.         
	Midway through the tie-breaker, when the score stood 3-3, coaches of both the teams opted to change their goalkeepers. While the move brought a remarkable change in Punjabs luck, sadly for Karnataka, it had the opposite effect.         
	Truth to tell though, Karnatakawere badly let down by their shooters. While the substitute goalkeeper Nagendra made a spectacular save off Balwant Singh to keep his team in the match, both Srinath and Sanath Kumar missed the last two shots to hasten Punjabs victory.         
	Punjabs regular goalkeeper Karanjit Singh, considered one of the best in the business, hurt his hands midway through the tie-breaker and coach Jagir Singh immediately brought in Paramjit Singh.         
	Paramjit never had to touch the ball. While Srinath ballooned the ball over, Sanath Kumars shot was wide off the mark.         
	The match was finally over when defender Ravinder Singh, originally from Air India, confidently put the ball past Nagendra in the final shot.         
	For Punjab, the scorers were Jaspal Singh, Jagpreet Singh, Sukhwinder Singh and Ravinder Singh. For Karnataka, Rajendra Prasad, Bimal Minz and Xavier Vijay Kumar scored.         
	It was not clear why the Karnataka coach R Thyagraj replaced goalkeeper Gumpe Rime with Nagendra in the tie-breaker.         
	TEAMS         
	Punjab: Karanjit Singh (Paramjit, tie-breaker); Jaspal Singh, Gurwinder Singh, Ravinder Singh and Baldeep Singh; Sukhwinder Singh, Baljit Saini (Balwant Singh, 106th), Amandeep Singh and Jagpreet Singh; Harvinder Singh (Balraj Singh, 46th) and Sakatar Singh.         
	Karnataka: Gumpe Rime (Nagendra, tie-breaker); T Raghui Singh, Pradeep, Jai Kumar and Rajendra Prasad; Xavier Vijay Kumar, Srinath, Prakash and Bimal Minz; Nabeel (Karthick, 89th) and Sanath Kumar.         
	Referee: Rizwan-ul-Haq (Delhi).

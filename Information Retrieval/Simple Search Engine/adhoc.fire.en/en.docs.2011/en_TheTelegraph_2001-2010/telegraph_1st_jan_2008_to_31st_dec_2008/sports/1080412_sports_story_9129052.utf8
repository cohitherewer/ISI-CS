The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Immelman takes clubhouse lead

	Augusta: Trevor Immelman showed that his four-under 68 in the opening round was no fluke and put up the same score on Friday at the US Masters to take the clubhouse lead.         
	The South African was at 8-under 136 heading to the weekend and two shots clear of the field, though Tiger Woods and Justin Rose were yet to tee off.         
	Thailands Prayad Marksaeng pulled out of the tournament on Friday because of a lingering back strain. The 42-year-old was 16-over for the tournament when he withdrew after nine holes.         
	Prayad is one of the three Asian players to receive a special invitation, the others being Indias Jeev Milkha Singh and ChinasLiang Wen-Chong.         
	On Thursday, Britains Rose reeled off six birdies in eight holes to share the first-round lead while Woods laboured to stay in touch.         
	Rose, who led after the first two rounds in 2004, shrugged off two early bogeys to fire a four-under-par 68 in bright sunshine on a soft Augusta National layout playing extra long.         
	The 27-year-old launched his sizzling run at the par-three sixth before ending the day level with Immelman, who missed a 10-footer at the last for a 67.         
	Britains Lee Westwood, four under with two holes to play, bogeyed the 17th in fading light on his way to a 69 and a tie for third with Americans Brandt Snedeker and Masters debutant Brian Bateman.         
	World No. 1 and four-time champion Woods, seeking his 14th major title, parred the first 12 holes before going bogey, bogey, eagle on his way to an opening 72.         
	Jeev was in upbeat mood after ending the first round three shots off the early pace. He birdied three of the four par-fives on his way to a one-under-par 71.         
	Woods, who has set his sights on becoming the first professional to achieve a calendar slam of the four majors, scrambled to stay level after 12 holes before bogeying 13 and 14.         
	However, he chipped in from behind the green to eagle the par-five 15th before parring the last three holes to finish four strokes off the pace.         
	I didnt really get anything going my way today, the 32-year-old American said. I played a lot better than what my score indicates. I hit a lot of good putts, nothing really went. I just had to stay patient.         
	Britains Ian Poulter spectacularly aced the par-three 16th on his way to an opening 70 in his fourth Masters appearance.         
	The 32-year-old holed out with an eight-iron from 169 yards to get to three under before slipping back with a bogey-par finish.         
	Among the other big names, twice Masters champion Phil Mickelson and twice US Open winner Retief Goosen opened with 71s. Fijis Vijai Singh, the 2000 champion, carded a 72 while Irelands Padraig Harrington, winner of last years British Open, opened with a 74.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chief national football coach Bob Houghton feels too many tournaments are counter-productive for the game in the country, suggesting that the clubs should provide proper opportunity to local talent.         
	We must have a larger pool of talent to choose from. But the clubs are obsessed with foreign strikers. Apart from Bhaichung (Bhutia) and Sunil Chhetri, Indian strikers are not regulars in their own clubs. How do you expect that there would be a flurry of quality strikers in the national side? asked the Briton at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Take, for example, Manjit Singhs case. Hes hardly got any chance in the Mahindra United side because of the Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu, Houghton said. We should take note of Saudi Arabias example. They had slapped a ban on importing foreign strikers between 1984 and 1989 and, look, they are now reaping the fruits, he added.         
	For him, only the I-League and the Federation Cup have relevance in developing the national side.         
	He also questioned the IFA Shields scheduling, saying it could have been an ideal preparation for the big teams had it been held at the start of the season.

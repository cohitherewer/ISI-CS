The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Venus win good for game: Martina
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Venus win good for game: Martina
                  Navratilova                     
	London: Nine-time Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova believes that Venus Williams fifth Wimbledon title proves that the womens tour is in good health.         
	Navratilova hit back at critics who argue there is a lack of genuine competition at the top level of the womens game, a problem acutely emphasised by the shock retirement of former world No. 1 Justine Henin.         
	Things on the womens side have been a little strange recently because Justine was the favourite in every match she played but suddenly she retired and there was a hole, navratilova told the BBC after seeing Venus beat sister Serena 7-5, 6-4 in the final.         
	Maria Sharapova played great at the Australian Open but shes been stagnating. Ana Ivanovic won the French Open but then totally deflated here at Wimbledon.         
	But the all-Williams final shows womens tennis is looking in good shape because weve got two superstars back in the fold and they could end up No. 1 by year end.         
	The womens game is wide open now and whoever is going to be a Grand Slam champion will have to play great tennis and earn it rather than win by default because somebody else is not playing well.         
	Navratilova added that even though the American sisters now play a light tour schedule, they have proved that they are still forces to be reckoned with.         
	A couple of years ago you thought to yourself, Venus is finished; maybe Serena can make a comeback but Venus is probably going to focus on her fashion interests or do something else, she said.         
	But here she is winning back-to-back Wimbledon titles. Despite what many detractors have said, its obvious that both girls are still enjoying the game and want to get back to the top, which breathes new life into the womens game.

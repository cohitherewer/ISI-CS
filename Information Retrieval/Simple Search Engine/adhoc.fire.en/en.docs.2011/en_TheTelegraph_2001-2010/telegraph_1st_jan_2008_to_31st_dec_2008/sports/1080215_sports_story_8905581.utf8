	Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi, whos had a successful return to court following his back surgery, will team up with full-time partner Mark Knowles of Bahamas in San Jose next week.         
	The 10-time Grand Slam champion left for the US on Thursday night.         
	Bhupathi, who was on a brief visit to the city, said rumours about Globosport having trouble over sponsorship issues regarding staging of the Sunfeast Open, were just that.         
	I dont know where these rumours are originating from, Bhupathi said. We have no issues with sponsorship.         
	Refusing to confirm whether the WTA Tier III meet will be shifted out, he said a decision would be taken later.

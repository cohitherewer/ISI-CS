                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nikolay: Im a machine
            K. KUMARASWAMY            Nikolay Davydenko                           
	Mumbai: On the mens tennis circuit, they call him the Iron Man  mainly for his extraordinary physical fitness, but the ace player is also known for his mental toughness and resilience.         
	Nikolay Davydenko, the world No. 5 from Russia, came through unscathed from a betting investigation by the ATP Tour. It has been one unending nightmare for the 27-year old, ever since Betfair voided all bets on his match against Argentinas Martin Vassallo Arguello in Poland last August due to unusual betting patterns. The ATP concluded a few weeks ago that it found no evidence of any foul play by either of the players.         
	But as the inquiry dragged on, Davydenko became the subject of innuendoes and public humiliation. At St Petersburg Open, his home tournament, last year he was warned by the umpire for not trying enough during a match. He was also fined $2000 by the ATP but the penalty was later rescinded.         
	Amid all this, Davydenko has shown remarkable tenacity and focus to win three titles this year and is likely to finish in the top-five for the fourth straight season (the season-ending Masters Cup is on in Shanghai).         
	Unlike other top-10 players, Davydenko has played 30 tournaments in each of the last four seasons.         
	The Russian, will be in action at the Chennai Open (beginning January 5) for the second time.         
	The following are excerpts from an e-mail interview with The Telegraph:         
	You must feel relieved and vindicated by the outcome of the betting investigation         
	Yes, (but) I have overcome that phase some time now. It (the entire episode) makes me feel sad but I have to forget about it and move ahead in life. I want to concentrate more on my career and do my best.         
	How was it to be under investigation and how did you manage to keep playing at the top level?         
	It didnt affect me much. I always concentrate on my work when I am on the field.         
	You played in Chennai in 2001 and lost in the first round. What memories do you have of the tournament?         
	I had started my season in 2001 with the Chennai Open. It was the beginning of my career, which has had ups and downs. Post Chennai Open, I played my first Grand Slam  the Australian Open, where I made it to the second round before losing to former world No. 1 Patrick Rafter in four sets. This performance showed to the public my talent and ability to play tennis. After eight years, I will be back in India and will keep my mind calm and focus on the game. I hope I can make a winning start to the year ahead and look forward to the crowd support.         
	You play 30 weeks on the ATP Tour consistently. Where from do you derive the physical and mental strength? And why do you play so many weeks when others in the top-10 dont?         
	I have been called the Iron Man because I play in more tournaments per year than any other player. I am like a machine, fit for every match and I give my best for all my matches. I have a consistent style of play which is my major strength and keeps me going.         
	Have we seen the end of Roger Federers dominance? How difficult is it going to be for him to get back the No. 1 ranking?         
	I think he didnt have a good year. As I always tell my colleagues that sometimes things dont go well as per your wish. I am sure he will have a great year ahead of him.         
	Your record on clay is as good as Nadal, and you are good on the hard courts as well. So, what makes the Spaniard a higher ranked player than you?         
	Yes I am good at hard courts as well but I was very close to winning a few of the matches but didnt go on to win them. I hope to convert the losses into victories and have a great year in 2009.         
	Do you agree that Nadals game revolves a lot around physical fitness? Can he dominate the game as long as Federer did?         
	Nadal and Federer are two great iconic sportsmen in the history of tennis. They are players who have the best of knowledge and have taken Tennis to a different level. Yes, I am sure Nadal can play the game the way he does and can dominate the game.

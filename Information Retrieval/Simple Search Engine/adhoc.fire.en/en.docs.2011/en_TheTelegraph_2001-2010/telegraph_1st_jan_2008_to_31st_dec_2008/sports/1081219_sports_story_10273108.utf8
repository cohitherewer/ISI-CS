            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: Reverse swing could play a crucial role in deciding the fate of the second Test match beginning on Friday, according to England captain Kevin Pietersen.         
	Asked whether reverse swing would be important on the Mohali track, Pietersen said: I definitely think its going to be crucial and so we would try to get some reverse swing here.         
	Unfortunately, we didnt get much of it in Chennai, which nullified a few things. Here the surface looks conducive to swing and we are looking to get some reverse swing going.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Do you need a change of approach in the second Test?         
	A I dont think so. In Chennai, we got into a good position to win the match but India eventually chased down the score. However, I dont think we need to change much.         
	What will be the composition of the team?         
	We have not decided the side, sorry. There are a few things we are looking into and a final decision would be only taken tomorrow. It is pretty much the full works. Obviously you have got guys who have come on the trip who are ready to go. We just need to make a decision on which is the best team to try and win a Test match.         
	Will reverse swing play a major role in the Test?         
	I definitely think its going to be crucial and so we would try to get some reverse swing here. Unfortunately, we didnt get much of it in Chennai, which nullified a few things. Here the surface looks conducive to swing and we are looking to get some reverse swing going.         
	Whats your game plan for this Test?         
	Its simple now. We have to get hard here.

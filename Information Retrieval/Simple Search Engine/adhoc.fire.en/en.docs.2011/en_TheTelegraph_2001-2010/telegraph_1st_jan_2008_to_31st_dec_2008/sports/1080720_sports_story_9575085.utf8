                  Ashwell Prince en route to his unbeaten 134 on Saturday                     
	Leeds: South Africa took complete control of the second Test on Saturday, finishing 119 runs ahead of England at 322 for four wickets.         
	Rain ended the final session early with Ashwell Prince on 134 not out, and AB de Villiers unbeaten on 70, as England failed to take a wicket in two sessions.         
	The pair added 179 for the fifth wicket  a record for South Africa against England at Headingley.         
	South Africa still have six wickets in hand and more rain now look to be Englands best hope of saving the Test.         
	Prince, who scored 101 in the drawn first Test at Lords, reached his second hundred of the series with a characteristic flick off his hip off the bowling of James Anderson just before tea.         
	He had earlier brought up his 50 midway through the afternoon session by crashing Monty Panesar for six over mid on.         
	De Villiers provided able support as South Africa completely dominated both the afternoon and evening sessions before the weather intervened.         
	England captain Michael Vaughan frequently rotated his bowlers but was unable to make the breakthrough even with the new ball four overs before tea.         
	England fast bowler Darren Pattinson on his debut trapped Hashim Amla leg before wicket for 38, but that was the only wicket to fall in the day.         
	South Africa added 57 runs in 23 overs in the morning session after resuming in the morning on 101-3.         
	England started the morning looking to make early inroads into South Africas middle order. But Amla and Prince were resolute in defence and increasingly confident in attack after rain had delayed the start by 15 minutes.         
	Pattinson took his first Test wicket when a full toss struck Amla on the pad and umpire Daryl Harper adjudged the ball to be going on to hit leg stump, although replays suggested otherwise.         
	It broke an important partnership for South Africa after the pair had added 67 runs for the fourth wicket.         
	De Villiers and Prince negotiated the remaining overs to lunch with Andrew Flintoff going wicketless despite being Englands most consistent bowler.           (AGENCIES)

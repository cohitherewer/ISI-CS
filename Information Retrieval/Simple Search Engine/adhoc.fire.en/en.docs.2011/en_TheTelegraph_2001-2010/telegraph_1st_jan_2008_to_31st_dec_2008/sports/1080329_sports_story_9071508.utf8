The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Assault leaves SA in a state of shock
                                                   Assault leaves SA in a state of shock
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Chennai: The handsome turnout at the Chepauk on Friday had come to see Sachin Tendulkar bat. Instead, they were treated to a run feast from the one who has modelled his game on the worlds best batsman.         
	Virender Sehwag pummelled the South African attack into submission and produced the fastest triple century in the history of Test cricket in terms of balls faced (278).         
	The Nawab of Najafgarh slammed 257 on Day III itself on way to an unbeaten 309 (42x4, 5x6) at stumps, the same score he made in Multan in 2004.         
	It was also his 14th hundred and fourth double century overall as he totalled close to two-thirds of the runs on Friday. He also featured in two double hundred partnerships, another record  213-run opening partnership with Wasim Jaffer and an unbroken 255 with Rahul Dravid.         
	India are still 72 adrift of South Africas 540 but Sehwag has opened up the ridiculous possibility of an Indian victory on the final day.         
	I witnessed Brian Laras 375 and 400 not out. I fear the record will get erased if he continues in this mould Simply brilliant, former England batsman Graham Thorpe told The Telegraph.         
	Sehwag looks ready for the challenge on the penultimate day even after spending 503 minutes at the crease in stifling heat and humidity. Am I not looking fresh! he asked after an ice bath and a massage in the dressing room.         
	Sehwag dismissed anything and everything the South Africans threw at him with disdain. The visitors trump card, Paul Harris, was milked dry through some intelligent use of the feet besides the reverse and paddle sweeps. The pacers looked helpless in the face of brute power and timing. The faster the ball, the faster it sped off his bat.         
	Shots just flowed from his blade and he made batting look so easy. There was no sign of tentativeness in Sehwags approach  only the mark of a master in control. It seemed as if he could have tamed the attack even with a toothpick.         
	There is very little a captain could do in the face of such calculated assault. The field placings made very little impact and Graeme Smith had to wait for him to commit a mistake. For the visitors, sadly, the moment never came.         
	True to his style, Sehwag was unfazed at the prospect of a second successive century as he reached it in style with two swashbuckling boundaries off Jacques Kallis. He then moved to 199 with a six over square leg off Makhaya Ntini and then reached the double hundred at better than run a ball (194).         
	A total of 108 runs were scored between lunch and tea.         
	Sehwag took just 78 balls for his second hundred and 84 for the third. There was nothing conventional about his batting  full-length deliveries on the stumps were sent speeding backward of square with a subtle turn of the wrists.         
	Forget the geometry of his strokes, it was more a triumph of the circumstances. Every shot will be replayed in the memory. With sublime orthodoxy, he shredded the attack as he reeled off square drives and thumps over the infield with alarming ease.         
	A huge straight six of Harris took him to 297 and a flick off Ntini soon after got him to 300. A standing ovation followed and he acknowledged it with a wave of the bat.         
	The bowling was made to look innocuous though South Africa couldnt be faulted for the fielding.         
	Jaffer paid the price for a lapse in concentration in the first session but Rahul Dravid played the perfect foil. He was never in a hurry and ensured Sehwag enjoyed most of the strike.         
	Dravid was batting on 65 at stumps, 15 short of 10,000 runs in Test cricket. Such was the second wicket pairs mastery of the situation that Smith dared not take the second new ball.   
	Sehwag break up    50 in 59 balls, 95 min, 6x4, 1x6  100 in 116 balls, 199 min, 15x4, 1x6  150 in 171 balls, 291 min, 23x4, 1x6  200 in 194 balls, 331 min, 32x4, 2x6  250 in 225 balls, 384 min, 39x4, 3x6  300 in 278 balls, 481 min, 42x4, 5x6

                                                     Ian wants ban on sledging

   SHARP SINGLES - Down Under
   
	 Ian Chappell has called for an end to on-field sledging. The former Australia captain feels that if this menace continues, very soon teams will end up exchanging fisticuffs.
 
	Ian, the elder brother of former Team India coach Greg, said players could take matters into their own hands and start throwing punches if umpires do not take a stand and stop the increasing number of on-field insults. The Australian skipper never walked away from a stoush on the field, but he said sledging had become too personal.
 
	10 years ago I wrote that it will end in fisticuffs, Ian was quoted as saying in the Herald Sun. It hasnt yet but it will if the officials dont understand how important it is to cut down on the inane chatter that happens on the field.
 
	The other thing that staggers me is that batsmen dont take the law into their own hands if the umpires wont stop it.
 
	Sydney century special: Hussey
 
	 Mike Hussey will cherish his century in Sydney as the most satisfying of his exceptional career mdash; even if it was rendered almost invisible by other events. When I came in, I think we were about level, so there was a lot of hard work to do and the Indians certainly had their tails up. We had lost two quick ones and I think they smelt that they had a really good chance of winning the Test, he was quoted as saying in the Herald Sun. 
 
	Warnes view
 
	 Shane Warne has come out with a different take on the issues that dogged the Sydney Test, saying the match generated a kind of passion that makes sports interesting. Sport is about passion and emotions and occasionally you overstep the line, Warne was quoted as saying in the Herald Sun on Wednesday.
 
	Occasionally, emotions spill over a little bit but that, to me, makes the sport interesting. It shows that people care about what they are doing, Warne said.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF), which made no secret of its displeasure when the Calcutta-based Bengal Peerless hosted German soccer giants Bayern Munich for an exhibition match last May, has now welcomed the Governments efforts to bring Real Madrid to India.         
	On Friday, after the Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports, MS Gill disclosed that he has already written to AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi seeking to discuss the Real Madrid issue, the AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said the Spanish giants could be brought to India.         
	No doubt we need huge money for this but that can be raised through sponsorships, said Colaco. The successful hosting of Bayern Munich match in India has proved that there are companies, who are willing to come forward for staging such exhibition matches.         
	The sports minister, on his part, released a letter written to him by Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon Ramos expressing his desire to play in India. It was a pleasure to meet you during the finals of the 2008 Wimbledon championships last Sunday, the Real Madrid chief said in his letter dated July 8.         
	Further to our conversation, we would be delighted that we could establish any kind of relationship between Real Madrid CF and India, through its government, and in particularly, through the ministry of youth affairs and sports, the letter said.         
	In that regard, I am at your disposal to discuss any proposal you might wish to make, the Real boss added.         
	The letter further said: As you can imagine, our club needs enough time to plan all their activities, therefore I would be grateful that any suggestion you may have, can be made in advance in order to be responded properly.         
	Real Madrid, considered one of the richest football clubs in the world, was founded in 1902. Apart from winning 31 Spanish league titles, the club has won the Champions League nine times. In 2000, Fifa awarded the Spanish club the title of best club of the 20th century.

	Calcutta: Second seeded Ong Beg Hee of Malaysia beat Egyptian Omar Abdel Aziz in a pulsating five-setter to march into the final of the Calcutta International Squash on Thursday.         
	In the final, Beg will meet fifth-seeded Mansoor Zaman who upset the third-seed, Egypts Omar Mosaad in the other semi-final.         
	While Beg prevailed 11-8, 9-11, 6-11, 11-8, 11-4 after a 70-minute duel, Zaman won 11-5, 4-11, 7-11, 11-7, 11-9.         
	The Zaman-Mosaad contest was highly competitive, with the Pakistani combining excellent lobs and drops with powerful shots that repeatedly drew cheers from the spectators.         
	Mosaad, who showed the door to India No. 1 Saurav Ghosal in the quarter final on Wednesday, played his customary hard-hitting game, but failed to measure up to Zamans spectacular allround display in the later stages.         
	In the final game, Mosaad was ahead 8-4, but Zaman wrested the initiative and went on to close the match in 45 minutes.         
	The other semi-final saw long rallies, high-class drop shots and neat placements.         
	Aziz bounced back after dropping the first game to take the next two but Beng raised his game by several notches to win the fourth.         
	The decider proved an anti-climax as Beg quickly raced to a 5-0 lead and maintained the tempo all through to squeeze into the summit round.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Patel says no to ICC job
                                                     Patel says no to ICC job
  - Bindra happy to be principal adviser only
            A STAFF REPORTER            Inderjit Singh Bindra                           
	Calcutta: South Africas Imtiaz Patel will not become the next International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive. I.S. Bindra, who was also in the running to succeed Malcolm Speed before he got appointed as the ICC principal adviser, has said he too is not keen on the post.         
	Im perfectly happy at being appointed the principal adviser, Bindra said on Monday afternoon.         
	The 43-year-old Patel withdrew his interest in the position and indicated his decision in a telephone conversation with ICC president-elect David Morgan on Sunday, stated an ICC release on Monday. Patel was the first choice to replace Speed, but he has elected to remain as chief executive of South African media organisation SuperSport.         
	Apart from Patel and Bindra, South Africas one-time chief selector Haroon Lograt was also believed to be in the initial fray for succeeding Speed. None of the candidates, however, had applied for the post and all were shortlisted by an international head-hunting farm.         
	According to an agency report, Lograt may now emerge as a strong candidate for the job. Its very premature to even talk about this subject, Lograt was quoted as saying. But obviously if the job is indeed offered to me, I would consider it as a great honour, he said.         
	ICC general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson might also come in the picture, the report said.         
	Reflecting on the decision, Patel said: My family and I have reflected deeply on the wonderful opportunity which the ICC presented to me to fulfil such an important role in a sport which is in my blood.         
	After considering my position carefully, I have, however, resolved to remain in my beloved country, South Africa, and continue in my challenging and fulfilling role as chief executive officer of SuperSport International.         
	Morgan said he was disappointed that Patel had chosen to withdraw his interest.         
	We are obviously disappointed that Imtiaz has chosen to withdraw his interest, having regarded him highly. However, the fact that Imtiaz has withdrawn does not mean that, by default, we will be left with a candidate who is, in any way, inferior to him.         
	In fact, we have been fortunate to have several high calibre candidates on the shortlist, all of whom bring something slightly different to the table. The role of ICC chief executive officer, while challenging, represents a huge opportunity for the successful candidate.         
	It is an opportunity for that person to help forge the future of our great game at a time of huge innovation and excitement. We remain committed to securing the services of the right candidate and we anticipate being able to complete that task in the very near future, he added.         
	The recruitment committee charged with identifying a successor to Speed will reconvene to identify a preferred candidate. The recruitment committee consists of Morgan, ICC president Ray Mali, vice-president Sharad Pawar and the chairman of Cricket Australia, Creagh Connor.         
	Once the committee identifies a candidate, it will make a recommendation to the ICC board with a view to confirming the appointment at the earliest opportunity.         
	The incoming CEO will take over from Speed, who steps down from the role after this years ICC annual conference, which will take place between June 29 and July 4.         
	Speed has held the position since July 2001, when he took over from the ICCs first CEO, David Richards.

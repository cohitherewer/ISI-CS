            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Jose Ramirez Barreto at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday.   A Telegraph picture        
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan extended their lead at the top of the Sahara CFL Premier Division by beating Peerless SC 2-1 on Monday at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Heavy rains meant the two teams had to play on a muddy pitch with soft underfoot conditions not aiding beautiful football. The two sides still went hammer and tongs at each other from the word go, trying to pass their way into the opposition half.         
	Mohun Bagan had the first chance when Lalawmpuiya took a crack on goal within the first quarter of the match. The shot was parried away smartly by Arunava Das, under the bars for Peerless.         
	Bagan looked to have taken the lead in the 18th minute, when a green and maroon players header seemed to have crossed the line, before a last ditch clearance from a Peerless defender.         
	Peerless hit Mohun Bagan on the break, soon after and took a shock lead through Uzozle Emmanuels powerful header from a Zoheb Hassan cross.         
	Bencharifas boys equalised in the 32nd minute through Lalawmpuiyas simple tap in. The goal came from a long Peter Odafe throw, which was guided to an unmarked Lalawmpuiya at the back post by Anand Vasan.         
	The second half was a story of near misses from both sides, till the evergreen Jose Ramirez Barreto popped up with the winner in the 51st minute. Barreto, striking home after a deadly half-turn smartly converted Mohan Rajs minus from the left, sending the Bagan fans home celebrating.

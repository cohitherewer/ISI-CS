                                                   Rajpal keeps mum 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Hockey star Rajpal Singh said on Saturday that whatever happened between him and national coach Joquim Carvalho in Australia recently was a thing of the past.         
	I am in no mood to discuss that issue again, the ace winger said on his arrival in India. We have a bigger task in hand at the moment. It is very important to do well in the Olympic qualifiers and all of us are concentrating on it.         
	Rajpal, who was considered very close to Carvalho, fell out with the coach during the tour-cum-preparatory camp in Perth and announced that he would never play for the national team again.         
	Equally tight lipped was Carvalho, who said that there was no issue involved in it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Royals look to get back to winning ways
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Royals look to get back to winning ways
                      
	Jaipur: Hosts Rajasthan Royals, for whom the defeat against Mumbai Indians came as a shock after five straight wins, will be keen to return to their winning ways against Deccan Chargers in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium on Friday.         
	Shane Warnes Rajasthan Royals were totally outplayed on Wednesday night just when they were riding high on consecutive victories at the half-way stage of the Twenty20 tournament, which they began with the tag of underdogs after their opening match loss.         
	With a 5-2 record, they share the top spot with Kings XI Punjab and are well placed in the race for the semi-finals but lag behind on run rate.         
	The heartening fact for Rajsthan Royals is that they now play two matches on home turf and Warne has already started calculating how to extract the maximum out of home advantage.         
	Besides, the loss also gives them an opportunity to regroup themselves and work out new strategies.         
	Although the batting of Rajasthan Royals miserably failed with only Swapnil Asnodkar and Shane Watson getting into double figures but it was more because of the fact that Mumbai bowlers made full use of the conditions and sent visitors gasping. They were very disciplined in their performance.           (PTI)

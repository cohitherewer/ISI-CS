The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fame still rests uneasy on Bhiwani Bombers
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fame still rests uneasy on Bhiwani Bombers
  - From getting mobbed to handling media, boxing trio yet to come to terms with celebrity status             Back from the rough and tumble of Beijing, Indias boxing trio appear in their own colours in Bhiwani on Saturday. While bronze medal winner Vijender Kumar finds a little time to relax (top), Akhil Kumar and Jitender Kumar strike a pose with crowns and mace (below). (PTI)                                   
	Bhiwani: With the euphoria around their power-packed Olympic performance finally settling, the boxing trio of Vijender Kumar, Akhil Kumar and Jitender Kumar are bracing themselves to take charge as the newest DSPs of Haryana while also trying to catch some sleep.         
	It feels nice but we dont know which area we would be given charge of. There is a certain aura about this post, isnt it? I hope to do justice to the responsibility, Akhil, flanked by a security personnel who will now accompany him wherever he goes, said.         
	Among the three, Vijender is already eyeing his preferred posting.         
	Given a choice, I would take charge of Gurgaon, said Indias first ever Olympic medallist in boxing, a bronze winner in the middle-weight category in Beijing.         
	The youngest of the three, Jitender is just happy to be a DSP at 20, in his second year of graduation.         
	Its a great feeling, gives me an adrenaline rush. I have a security personnel with me all the time. Lets see what the job is all about, he quipped.         
	Being mobbed by adoring fans and attending felicitations are part of their new routines and though exhausted, the Bhiwani bombers, as they are fondly called now, say they are more than happy to oblige any autograph hunter or photograph seeker.         
	I used to practise my signature for this very day. And now that it is happening, it is surreal. Till about a few months ago we could pass through these streets completely unnoticed but now everybody turns around and recognises, said Akhil, a bantam-weight quarterfinalist in Beijing, as he scribbled in Hindi for a fan.         
	Some kids pulled my shirt during a recent felicitation, I told them I would be back on these streets in a couple of weeks but they wanted a photo there and then. And you cant say no to kids, he added.         
	It is tiring but chalega (okay). Sometimes the fans have gone overboard, pulling our clothes and we have been asked the same questions over and over again by the media but its ok. We can handle it, added Vijender.         
	Jitender, meanwhile, cannot have enough of the new-found fame that has come with his lion-hearted performance in Beijing, where he fought with 11 stitches on his chin in the quarter final.         
	He was felicitated with a gold medal in his birthplace Devsar, and the fly-weight pugilist is the biggest celebrity for the villagers there.         
	I still dont have proper signatures, so whenever somebody asks for my autograph, I just scribble my name in capital letters. But I am practising, he said with a wide grin.         
	In fact, the trio seems omnipresent in Bhiwani, peeping out from colourful posters and hoardings put up across the district to applaud their achievements.         
	But even as they enjoy the adulation and other benefits of their hard work, sleep has become a major casualty.         
	Let the whole thing settle down, I am going to spend an entire day sleeping, said Vijender, whose Kaluwas home has become a milestone in itself here.         
	Relaxing on the edge of his two-storey homes balcony, the 22-year-old said, its so quiet and peaceful. I have been craving for such solitude since my return.         
	Akhil, on the other hand, has been stealing a nap here and there amid the numerous functions he has attended since his return.         
	Catching Bollywood flicks they missed during Olympics is another one of their priorities.         
	Me and Akhil bhai will watch Singh is Kinng when we get some time off, said Jitender, who started boxing at the age of eight after trying his hand at judo for a while.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjuna praises nice guy Sachin
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arjuna praises nice guy Sachin
                      
	Colombo: Adam Gilchrist might have called Sachin Tendulkar a bad sport but for former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga, the Indian batting maestro is one of the most well-behaved cricketers he had played with.         
	He (Tendulkar) was one of the nicest guys I played cricket with ... The thing I admired of him was his commitment to the game. I am very glad that he has left behind (the issue), Ranatunga said.         
	I have not seen anyone who is so committed to cricket. Actually I learnt a lot from him. I was not committed enough to my batting. The result shows. I think he (Tendulkar) is a role model for any young cricketer, Ranatunga said.         
	Ranatunga, now the Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), said Tendulkar deserved to become Test crickets highest run-getter surpassing West Indian great Brian Lara. I think he (Tendulkar) deserves that because of the commitment. He is one of the greatest cricketers I have played cricket with.         
	Ranatunga feels that Tendulkar can easily play for a couple of years more and he deserves the luxury to decide when to hang up his boots.         
	I feel he can easily play for a couple of years more. I think the important thing is he has to take care of his injuries. When you are getting older you are getting into all these issues.         
	But he is still fit enough to play cricket. Even Sourav Ganguly, he is still getting runs. I think there will be a big vacuum when the Fab Four go, Ranatunga said.         
	Only Sachin should decide (on his retirement). If he feels that he is not enjoying the game he should announce his retirement, he added.         
	Ranatunga has seen Tendulkar from the start of his career as Ranatunga was the captain of Sri Lanka then.                 (PTI)

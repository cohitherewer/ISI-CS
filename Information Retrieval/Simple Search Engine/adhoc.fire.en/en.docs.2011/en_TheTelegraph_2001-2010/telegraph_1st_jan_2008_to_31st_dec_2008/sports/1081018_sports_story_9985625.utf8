                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sachins passion is almost unbelievable, says Shastri
    - Former India captain on Test crickets highest run-getter             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL             Ravi Shastri                                 
	Chandigarh: Call it the Mumbai connection or whatever, but its a fact that Sachin Tendulkar has always been very close to former India captain Ravi Shastri. On Friday, Shastri (now among the most popular of TV commentators) spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on Sachin, Test crickets No.1 run-getter.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q The records apart, what has been Sachins biggest contribution to Indian cricket?         
	A The way he has played the game Even after almost 20 years at the highest level, Sachin remains passionate and, often, conveys the enthusiasm of a schoolboy As a person, he has remained humble Indeed, his humility is remarkable.         
	How would you describe Sachin?         
	Hes somebody who is modest about his achievementsTill recently, hed be rather shy too His passion is almost unbelievable and thats why I think he has two-three years of cricket left in him.         
	Purely from the point of cricket, what stands out?         
	Sachins consistency Hes got big runs all over and its not easy being so consistent over such a length of time.         
	But some arent convinced about Sachins ability to deliver in some of the most crucial moments         
	They should take a walk Let somebody score half the runs Sachin has before opening his mouth. (After a pause) People who havent even held a stump, forget holding a cricket bat, are the ones who sit in judgement. Thats just not on. Even on the last tour of Australia, last season, Sachin batted as if he was on his first visit there. What more do you want? In my book, he has scored in all situations.         
	Youd also been on Sachins first tour, to Pakistan in 1989-90. What did you make of him then?         
	His ability amazed me What probably caught my eye more is how quickly he adjusted He seemed to be in a hurry in his first Test innings (getting 15), as if it was another school game Soon enough, though, hed adapted to the demands of big-time cricket He realised that he was on a stage much bigger than school.         
	Sachin didnt go off despite being hit by Waqar Younis in the second innings of the Sialkot Test, the last of that series...         
	Absolutely He bled from the nose, but stayed put Lesser cricketers couldve been scarred for life, not Sachin That was a big test for him and he came off with flying colours If anything, he matured so fast on that tour.         
	The defining moment, however, would be the 1991-92 tour of Australia, isnt it?         
	Well, that made him a world-class player That he got hundreds in the Tests in Sydney and Perth, in particular, helped him get to that level quicker The hundred (114) in Perth was awesome.         
	You got a double hundred in Sydney and, so, watched Sachin from the closest of quarters. How do you look back on his first Test hundred (148 not out) in Australia?         
	I remember having marvelled at his ability The timing, control The balance He was fearless, which was driven by the exuberance of youth Sachin was only 18, but wouldnt take any bullshit from the Australians.         
	Your favourite Sachin innings         
	(Grins) Quite a few In Tests, the two hundreds (Sydney, Perth) on his first tour of Australia The 122 at Edgbaston on the 1996 tour, when the ball was doing so much After that, the 136 at the Chepauk against Pakistan in 1998-99 With the ball reversing, the Sachin-(Wasim) Akram contest had been absorbing and we really should have won that Test Id also pick his unbeaten 154 in Sydney on the last tour of Australia In ODIs, the back-to-back hundreds against Australia (143, 134) in Sharjah in April 1998, the 98 against Pakistan in Centurion in the 2003 World Cup and the two innings (117 not out and 91) in the tri-series finals in Australia this year All have been terrific.         
	How has Sachin been able to handle such immense pressure and that too over almost two decades?         
	Dont know, honestly I know I couldnt handle it for the dozen or so years that I played for India The pressure on Sachin has been more than, say, on the greats of the 70s and 80s as the media scrutiny is so much more nowadays         
	Whats the legacy Sachin will be leaving once he does call it a day?         
	A high standard of work ethic Exemplary focus Discipline of the most remarkable kind Sportsmanship The way he has handled himself has been enviable Youll remember the standing ovation he got right through the last Test series in Australia Thats the respect he has.         
	Is age too much of an issue in India?         
	Look, age should become an issue only if you arent performing, not otherwise Perform and nobody will say anything about age.         
	The last one: When will we get another Sachin Tendulkar?         
	Such players probably come every 40-50 years Sunil Gavaskar retired more than 20 years ago, but we still havent produced another like him Yes, we have a blaster in (Virender) Sehwag, but havent seen another Gavaskar. So

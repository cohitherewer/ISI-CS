The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi vows fireworks
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Afridi vows fireworks
                  Shahid Afridi                     
	Karachi: Pakistans flamboyant allrounder Shahid Afridi said he would be aiming to better Brendon McCullums awe-inspiring 73-ball 158 when he makes his debut for Hyderabad Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League (IPL) Tuesday. The swashbuckling right-hander left for India on Monday to play in the IPL and said McCullums knock was fresh in his mind.         
	McCullum scored 100 from 53 balls during his blazing innings for Kolkata Knight Riders against Bangalore Royal Challengers in the opening match on Friday.         
	Afridi, who has since 1997 held on to the record for the fastest one-day hundred from just 37 balls, said he was itching to emulate or surpass McCullums innings.         
	It is a very difficult target to achieve to better his 158 at a faster rate. But it is not impossible. Certainly if I get a chance to bat higher up the order and get enough overs to play I will give it a try, Afridi told reporters after the Twenty20 International against Bangladesh at the National Stadium Sunday.         
	Afridi will be available for the Deccan Chargers  led by VVS Laxman  for their game against Delhi Dare Devils.         
	I have a reputation of being an exciting batsman and a fast scorer and big hitter. I wouldnt like to disappoint my fans in the IPL which is Twenty20 cricket and to my liking, Afridi said. The 28-year-old said McCullum had played a once in a lifetime innings and it would be hard to beat. But this is what makes cricket exciting for me when you have ambitions of chasing down such targets.         
	Afridi who has appeared in 258 one-day Internationals said he would love to also hold the record for the fastest century in Twenty20 cricket.         
	If I get a chance to open the innings or bat higher I will certainly give it a try. I am very proud of my record for the fastest one-day hundred.         
	The IPL is an exciting concept and I am very keen on leaving my mark in the tournament with bat and ball for my team, Afridi stated. (PTI)

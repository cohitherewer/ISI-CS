The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tour crucial for future of Indian cricket: Gary
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tour crucial for future of Indian cricket: Gary
            A STAFF REPORTER            Gary Kirsten                           
	Calcutta: On the eve of leaving for Bangladesh for a tri-series, which also features Pakistan besides the hosts, Team India coach Gary Kirsten addressed the media at a news conference.               
	The following are excerpts         
	First foreign tour as India coach         
	Its my first foreign tour, its a challenge not only for me, but also for the whole team.         
	The injury to Sreesanth         
	Sreesanth was a very important part of the one-day team. But its a chance for the one who has replaced him he has to prove himself.         
	On the lack of experience in the team         
	Always nice to have experience in the team but its a challenge. Not only Sachin (Tendulkar), but all experienced players have a significant role to play in the team. But we need to have forward thinking, we need to back the young players. The best possible example is Yusuf Pathan, who performed so well under pressure in the IPL final. This tour is very crucial for the future of Indian cricket.         
	The change of format from Twenty20 to ODIs         
	One-day cricket obviously is a different format from Twenty20. The batsmen dont need to come and start hitting from the first ball. They get time to adjust. Its all about adaptation. The players who are chosen to play for India definitely have sufficient skill to adapt to any condition and format.         
	After the success of IPL what is the future of ODI cricket         
	Its totally at the stage of speculation about what is going to work The IPL is very successful, the ICC needs to make a decision on how they want to treat IPL.         
	Whether the spin attack looks a bit weak without Harbhajan         
	It looks a bit weak but I am excited about the young talents in our side. I havent seen them much. If the selectors think they are up to it I will definitely back them to the hilt.         
	On Manpreet Gony         
	He looks to be an exciting prospect but bowling 10 overs is different than bowling just four overs like in the IPL.         
	On Paddy Upton         
	Paddy is our physical and mental trainer. His role will be very crucial in our side as cricket is becoming more about a mental game these days.

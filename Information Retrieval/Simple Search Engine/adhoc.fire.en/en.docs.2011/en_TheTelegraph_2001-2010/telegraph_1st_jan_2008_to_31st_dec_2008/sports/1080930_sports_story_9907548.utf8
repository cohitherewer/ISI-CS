The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians plan to play three quicks 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Australians plan to play three quicks 
                      
	Melbourne: Australia coach Tim Nielsen has indicated that the visitors will include three seamers and a spinner in the opening Test against India starting in Bangalore from October 9.         
	I think we did a pretty reasonable job in the West Indies playing on low, flat, pretty slow wickets that spun late in the game, especially the first two Tests with three quicks and a spinner, so Id expect thats what the mix will be, I think that suits best the way we play, Nielsen was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	The coach, however, said there were still a couple of spots undecided but those would be filled depending on the Indians team combination.         
	Theres still two or three spots people are trying to force their way into. It depends a little bit on what the Indian team is as well, whether they pick a lot of right-hand batsmen or left-hand batsmen and that might make a little bit of a difference to our spinning options, Nielsen said.         
	Weve got a couple of spinners who havent played a Test match yet so its about getting them a run in the next week and seeing how they front up.         
	Well just have to sort out what that mix is and who our spinner is, basically, he said.         
	On 36-year-old Bryce McGain, Nielsen said: Hes just finishing off (his rehab), it wouldve been nice to get him going in the two-day game but the physio just felt if we tried to do everything in the competitive game he might be going a little too hard.         
	Were trying to keep it controlled, now he should be fit and right to play in the four-day game, he said.         
	Nielsen and assistant coach Greg Chappell face an awesome task with an inexperienced side before the first Test in Bangalore on October 9.         
	Nielsens previous experience with the youngsters is bound to come in handy. He spent three years helping John Buchanan in the national set-up before becoming the head coach of the Centre of Excellence in Brisbane in 2005.         
	Meanwhile, Jason Krejza has managed to make a fast start, looking an ideal fit for Indian conditions against Rajasthan Cricket Academy.           (PTI)

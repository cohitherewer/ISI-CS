	Perth: India relied on an inspired display by their bowlers who skittled out Australia cheaply to put the team in the drivers seat with a substantial 118-run first innings lead in the third Test Thursday. 
    
	The visitors were dismissed for 330 in the first innings but hit back brilliantly by bundling out the hosts for a paltry 212 to gain the upper hand on a bouncy Waca track. 
    
	The Indians were 52 for one in the second innings and had extended their overall lead to 170 runs at close. 
    
	Paceman Rudra Pratap Singh was the pick of the Indian bowlers with four for 68 while Irfan Pathan, Ishant Sharma and skipper Anil Kumble chipped in with two wickets apiece. 
    
	The hosts were gasping at 61 for five at one stage before Andrew Symonds (66) and Adam Gilchrist (55) salvaged the situation to some extent with a 102-run sixth wicket partnership. 
    
	The partnership was finally brought to an end by Kumble who in the process became the first Indian to scalp 600 Test wickets and the third in the world after Muttiah Muralidharan (723) and Shane Warne (708). 
    
	Virender Sehwag (29) and night watchman Irfan Pathan (two) were at the crease as the Indians negotiated the 11 overs. 
    
	Pakistani umpire Asad Rauf, who had adjudged Sachin Tendulkar leg before wicket when the ball seemed to go over the stumps on the opening day, gave another dubious leg before decision against Mahendra Singh Dhoni Thursday. 
    
	But the Indians took the umpiring blunders in their stride and had Australia in trouble straightaway with the paceman removing the top half without much fuss. 
    
	And just when the Aussies showed signs of coming back into the game, Kumble, playing his 124th Test, had Symonds caught off a cut which hit wicketkeeper Dhonis gloves and lobbed off for Rahul Dravid to complete an easy catch. 
    
	Symonds and Gilchrist were staging a recovery for Australia with a 102-run fourth wicket stand from 104 balls before Kumble provided the breakthrough and allowed his other bowlers to run through the rest. 
    
	Kumble, who came on to bowl in the 28th over, held aloft the ball as everyone in the ground acknowledged his achievement. Gilchrist crossed the pitch and hailed the achievement of the Indian spinner. 
    
	India lost their final four wickets for two runs off 16 balls with Stuart Clark and Mitchell Johnson sharing the spoils. 
    
	But the balance tilted in Indias favour soon after as India took the first three Australian wickets cheaply before lunch. 
    
	Pathan set the ball rolling by sending back the two openers in his second over. Debutant Chris Rogers (four) was adjudged lbw and his partner Phil Jaques (eight) departed two deliveries later, when he drove at an outswinger to be caught at slips.

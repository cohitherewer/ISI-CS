                                                                                                                                                                                                     Blast shadow over Ranji tie
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Following Thursdays blasts in Guwahati, the Assam Cricket Association (ACA) has written to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) requesting a postponement of the scheduled November 3 Ranji Plate Division match between Bengal and Assam. CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra said they had learnt of this development and at the moment had no objection to a possible deferment.         
	There could also be a question mark over the India vs England ODI to be played in Guwahati on November 29.

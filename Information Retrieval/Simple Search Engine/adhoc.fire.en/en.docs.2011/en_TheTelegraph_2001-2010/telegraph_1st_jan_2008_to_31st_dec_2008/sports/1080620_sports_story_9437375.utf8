The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer not among Borgs favourites
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Federer not among Borgs favourites
            MARK HODGKINSON            Roger Federer                           
	Someone mentioned the R-word for Roger Federer. Bjorn Borg was in his mid-20s when he famously and abruptly put down his wooden rackets. And Borg would not be shocked if Switzerlands world No.1, who turns 27 in a couple of months, were to announce his retirement next season: I wouldnt be at all surprised if Roger came out next year and said, Im not going to play tennis any more.         
	It is a statement that could have the alarm-bells and cowbells ringing across the tennis world. I think Roger will probably carry on playing tennis, but if he retired next year that wouldnt surprise me. He has been through so much, he has done so much, he has been professional, hes been working hard, hes been winning everything. It probably wont happen, but if Roger suddenly decides to retire that wouldnt shock me at all, said Borg.         
	People expect Roger to win the whole time, and thats both mentally and physically tiring. Its not going to be like it used to be, when he won almost everything. That time has gone.         
	This could be a career-defining summer for Federer. It could be the golden summer when he wins his sixth consecutive Wimbledon trophy, taking him past Borgs five in a row. And yet Borg hasnt picked out Federer as his favourite to lift the golden Challenge Cup.         
	He doesnt even have Federer down as his second choice. Borg has bumped the serial winner down into third. I pick Rafael Nadal as the winner. My second choice is Novak Djokovic, and my third choice is Roger, Borg said, calmly presenting his intriguing one-two-three.         
	He was also calm at the Wimbledon museum on Wednesday morning when, during a promotional, he saw the caricature that cartoonist Gerald Scarfe had drawn of him, accentuating the length of his nose.         
	By Federers high standards, this has been a mediocre season and he arrives at the All England Club without a slam title this year; but Borg thinks that the top seed is now even vulnerable on Wimbledons Centre Court.         
	To think there was once a time (just a year ago) when the Swiss was believed to be as safe and as unpickable as his countrys famed bank vaults. But a lot has changed in 12 months. Mens tennis is now a three-headed beast.         
	Borg said: A year ago, I would have had Roger as my favourite, but that was then. Nadal and Djokovic are playing much better tennis than they were a year ago. I think that Roger is going to be the No.1 player at the end of the year anyway. But for him to beat those guys at Wimbledon, he needs to play much better than he did last summer. He knows that he is going to have to play some unbelievable tennis to win again. This is the most open Wimbledon in years.         
	Not winning a Grand Slam tournament in one year, that would be a huge disappointment for him. If he doesnt win a Grand Slam this year, hes still up there, and if he keeps his motivation and stays away from injuries, next year he might win one, he might win two or three. He wants to break more records.

                                                   CA defends Hogg

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: The defence team of Aussie spinner Brad Hogg will argue that the Australian didnt mean any malice and his jibe was taken out of context when he was charged for a Level III offence of racial abuse according to the ICC Code of Conduct. The hearing is scheduled to be held on Monday. 
    
	Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was also charged for the same offence that resulted to a three-Test ban for him. 
    
	India have appealed against the ban but a hearing date has yet to be set, which implies that Harbhajan is free to play in next weeks third Test in Perth. 
    
	According to a report in an Australian daily, the Herald Sun, Hogg was cited for allegedly abusing Indian captain Anil Kumble and vice-captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Sydney. 
    
	The Indian duo were batting when spinner Hogg walked by at the end of an over and allegedly said: I cant wait to run through you bastards. 
    
	The term bastard is considered extremely offensive in India because it means a child has been born out of wedlock.

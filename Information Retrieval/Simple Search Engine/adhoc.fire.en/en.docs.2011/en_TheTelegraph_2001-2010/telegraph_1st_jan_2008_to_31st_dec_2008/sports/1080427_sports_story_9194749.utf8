The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Board wont tolerate any indiscipline, says Pawar
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Board wont tolerate any indiscipline, says Pawar
                            
	New Delhi: BCCI chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday said that the Board will act tough against any incidence of indiscipline and wont remain a mute spectator if anyone violates the code of conduct.         
	My message to Indian players who have got contractual obligations with the Board is that they have to honour each and every guideline about discipline which the Board has communicated to them, and they have accepted and signed, Pawar said.         
	The BCCI president came out with his reaction after Harbhajan Singh was temporarily suspended from the Indian Premier League for allegedly slapping Sreesanth.         
	If somebody is going to violate it (code of conduct), the Board will not sit as a silent spectator, Pawar said.         
	He said if there is any evidence of wrongdoing, swift action would be taken.         
	If there is prima facie evidence, (IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit) Modi should take action right now and they should give opportunity to both sides and take a final view.         
	I told the BCCI secretary to serve a notice to him (Harbhajan) and give him a specific time and opportunity and take a final decision on which we will act on Monday, Pawar said. The IPL committee, I hope, will take a separate decision. (PTI)

            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Graeme Smith                           
	Calcutta/Melbourne: South Africa will aim for a historic series win when they take on world champions Australia in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from Friday.         
	Having drawn with India in the sub-continent and having beaten England away this year, Graeme Smiths men are now 1-0 ahead in the three-Test series against Australia. The Proteas chased down the second highest total in the history of Test cricket in Perth to take the lead in the series.         
	Captain Smith set the second Test in perspective. From our point of view we have had three of the toughest tours this year with India, England and now here. We drew in India, we won in England and, if we can close off this series here in Australia, it will be an incredible performance for this team and probably the most successful season ever for South African cricket, he was quoted as saying in a Cricket South Africa statement.         
	That is what we have the chance to achieve and to beat Australia in Australia is something everybody would like to have in their career. As a sportsman a Boxing Day Test is one of those great occasions.         
	We will obviously discuss a few things and be as well prepared as we can from that side, but on the day it is a motivation to perform well. There is no greater occasion to perform well.         
	Coach Mickey Arthur wants his side to remain focused and not get swept up in the euphoria of the Perth win. One victory doesnt make a summer. Theres a huge amount of cricket for us to play.         
	The South African captain said it was also a chance to reflect on his own life and career and the changes he had gone through since his last tour to Australia in 2005.         
	It is nice to come back here and see how far I have progressed in my life and my career and how things have changed.         
	One thing that has, of course, changed is his chronic elbow injury and that on its own has taken considerable adjustment. Mentally you look forward to coping with it as best as you can. Fortunately I have been batting well through it and I have been able to adapt my game quite well.         
	At the moment our focus is purely on this Test match and we dont want anything to get in the way of that.         
	Under pressure Australia may miss the services of Andrew Symonds due to a knee injury.         
	Symonds, also a useful slow bowler, sustained the injury during the first Test and bowled just two overs in South Africas first innings in Perth. He has consulted a knee specialist in Melbourne and is undergoing treatment from team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris.         
	The Queenslander will have to pass a fitness test before he is declared fit for the second Test.         
	Ricky Ponting was unsure whether Symonds would be fit enough to play at the MCG.         
	Its really a day-to-day thing with him at the moment. He went into the game (first Test) okay and bowled in the first innings but couldnt really bowl after his second over, Ponting said.         
	Ashwell Prince, suffering from a cracked thumb, had a try out in the nets on Wednesday and a decision on his availability will be taken after Christmas Days practice.

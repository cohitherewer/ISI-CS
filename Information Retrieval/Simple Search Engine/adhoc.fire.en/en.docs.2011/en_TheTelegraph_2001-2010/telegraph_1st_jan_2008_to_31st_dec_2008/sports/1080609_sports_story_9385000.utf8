	Lahore: A Pakistan Cricket Board tribunal on Sunday deferred a decision on fast bowler Shoaib Akhtars appeal against a five-year ban until June 14.         
	We need some more time as we have to study more documents, Farrukh Aftab, chief of the PCB tribunal, said. He did not go into the details of the documents. Akhtar was allowed to compete in the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) last month after the tribunal lifted the ban for one month.         
	Akhtars lawyers had asked the tribunal to temporarily lift the ban because the IPL was refusing to allow him to take part in its competition while the ban stood, even though the original sanction was not intended to cover non-international cricket outside Pakistan.               
	 Melbourne: Shane Warne now has his home side  Victoria  in the rival court when he leads Rajasthan Royals in the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 tournament.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McGain is to return home
                                                                                                                                                                                                     McGain is to return home
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australian leg-spinner Bryce McGain will return to Australia as he has not recovered from a right shoulder injury.         
	Cricket Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said that the decision to send McGain home was made after it was determined that the Victoria spinner would not be able to bowl for the majority of the India tour, according to a Cricket Australia media release on Friday.         
	Bryces injury was first sustained in an Australia A match in September and despite his managing his workload throughout the early stages of this tour, he suffered a setback at training on Tuesday in an attempt to be available for Australias four-day match currently being played in Hyderabad.         
	As a result, it has been decided that Bryce will not be available for selection for the majority of the tour, the release said.         
	Andrew Hilditch, chairman of Australias national selection panel, said that a decision on a potential replacement for McGain would be taken in due course.

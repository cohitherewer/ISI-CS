The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nielsen plays down Ricky-Bhajji spat 
                                                     Nielsen plays down Ricky-Bhajji spat 
                  Ricky Ponting after his dismissal on Sunday                     
	Adelaide: Australia coach Tim Nielsen on Monday played down the brief exchange of words between Harbhajan Singh and Ricky Ponting in Sundays match and admitted the home captains poor form had become a worry for the team.         
	Ponting, who has been Harbhajans bunny in the Test series against India, could not hide his glee after his nemesis was out in Sundays match which the hosts won by 50 runs.         
	Ponting appeared to say something to Harbhajan as the Indian left the crease but his coach felt there was not much to make out of it.         
	Its been a long summer and there is a bit of feeling between the sides. But its not different to what has always happened in the 100 years of the game. Only because its between India and Australia, Harbhajan and Ponting and those sort of things and people notice it more, he said.         
	I dont think it isnt there in the games against Sri Lanka but they are not noticed as much, Nielsen added.         
	He, however, was candid enough to admit that the top order was not firing on all cylinders and the captain had not been at his best, to say the least.         
	Ricky has set such high standards over the last four or five years that everyone wants to see a bit more on the screen, he said.         
	Hes not having the season he would like. He hit the ball pretty hard but straight to point. He is showing good form at the nets but is under pressure for not contributing as he would like to, Nielsen said.         
	Our top order has missed out. Its not been easy to force the pace, Nielsen added.         
	The coach now wants his batsmen to hit more shots down the ground than get caught in the slip cordon for the rest of the series.         
	Our middle order hasnt jelled and thats no secret. Players know it, they are desperate for answers and its time to refresh and clear up your thinking.         
	Nielsen credited the bowlers of this tournament for making life difficult for the batsmen. (PTI)

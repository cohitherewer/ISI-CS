	Melbourne: Outgoing Cricket Australia (CA) chairman Creagh Connor has admitted that downgrading the racism charges against Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh during the monkeygate saga had damaged the administrators relationship with the players.         
	The last Australian summer was the most difficult time in my long career in cricket and the male players ended the year feeling at a distance from the managers of the Australian game, Connor was quoted as saying by an Australian news agency. (PTI)

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ishant: Getting hit is part and parcel of the game
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ishant Sharma at a promotional in the city on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Ishant Sharma believes that the top orders inability to forge good partnerships is responsible for the lacklustre show of the home team in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The speedster from Delhi was speaking on the sidelines of the inauguration of an online (zapak.com) and mobile gaming service (Jump games) at a city hotel on Monday.         
	I feel we lacked a good partnership in the top order. Once we are able to overcome that hurdle and build partnerships in the initial six overs of the game, things will change for us, Ishant told reporters. Hope that happens from the next match.         
	Ishant knows the Knight Riders need a win. Everybody is giving 100 per cent and everybody is trying hard. I am hopeful that things will different from the next match. We need to get our momentum back And once the momentum is back I think things will change for the better, he said.         
	On his expensive final over during the Knight Riders match against Kings XI Punjab in Mohali on Saturday, Ishant said: I think its very difficult to accept it when a batsman hits you for boundaries and overboundaries         
	But it had been long time since I had been so expensive in an over But you know that is part and parcel of the game You have to accept it.         
	Ishant was battered by Piyush Chawla for four boundaries and one six while giving away 21 runs to help Yuvraj Singhs Punjab side notch up 178. The Sourav Ganguly-led Knight Riders fell nine runs short for their fourth loss on the trot.         
	Ishant was fined 10 per cent of his match fees by Match Referee Clive Lloyd after he was seen kicking the stumps during the match. It was a mistake Your temperament is not in your hands all the time he said.         
	Asked whether cricketers were becoming temperamental because of the pressure they were under, Ishant said, I dont think so. But it depends on what kind of player you are.         
	The 19-year old seems excited that Shoaib Akhtar will be joining the team. He is a great bowler He is very experienced and I will be delighted to share the same dressing room with him I feel that his inclusion will obviously help us a lot.         
	Rubbishing the notion that the shortest version of the game would limit a bowlers career, Ishant said they just need to vary their action according to the format of the game.         
	I feel a good bowler is always good bowler. He just needs to vary his line and length according to the format. He should change his mentality and should adjust to the situation, Ishant said.

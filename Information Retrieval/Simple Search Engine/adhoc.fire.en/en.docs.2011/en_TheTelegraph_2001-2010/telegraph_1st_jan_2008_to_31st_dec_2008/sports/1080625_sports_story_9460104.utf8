	Arnos Vale (St Vincent): Debutant Shaun Marsh struck an impressive 81 as Australia set West Indies a challenging target of 274 in the first one-day International on Tuesday.         
	Shaun gave Australia a flying start with Shane Watson (31).         
	With Chris Gayle, who won the toss and put the tourists in, using five bowlers inside the first eight overs, Australia reached 53 without loss in the first ten overs. The opening pair put on 75 before Watson was trapped leg before by Dwayne Bravo as he tried to work the ball on the legside.         
	West Indies pace bowler Jerome Taylor continued his excellent record against Ricky Ponting (5), the Australian captain playing on with a thick inside edge, the fourth time he has been dismissed by Taylor in six one-day encounters between the pair.

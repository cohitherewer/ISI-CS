The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hong Kong battered by perfect slog
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hong Kong battered by perfect slog
  - Record Asia Cup total as tune-up for todays match vs Pakistan       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hugs Suresh Raina after the latter reached his century in Karachi on Wednesday                                 
	Karachi: There were more security personnel than the paying public during Wednesdays India versus Hong Kong mismatch in the Asia Cup.         
	It hadnt been any better the day before either.         
	The Asian Cricket Council is, of course, hoping that Thursdays India-Pakistan clash (again, at the National Stadium) will bring the tournament alive.         
	While the on-field action may actually be of the fiercely competitive kind, theres no guarantee that the terraces will be thickly populated.         
	If the script does unfold in that manner, then the administrators have to take the rap for overdoing the India-Pakistan business.         
	The two countries faced each other in five ODIs (across India) last November. Then, there were two meetings in Dhaka just weeks ago. And, now, another competition...         
	Understandably, Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni steered clear of the issue. There was a time when people said there was no Indo-Pak cricket and, now, its too much... Its for the Boards to handle this... Such things arent in my hands.         
	The Dhaka battles ended 1-1, with Pakistan recovering from a humiliating battering in the league stage. The result of the final there, though, shouldnt be seen as a definite pointer of form.         
	On paper, India have started the Asia Cup as favourites... But, then, were playing at home and I know that the seniors in particular are desperate to give a good account of themselves, former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja told The Telegraph.         
	The hosts had, at one stage, been in more than a spot of bother on Tuesday till Fawad Alam and Sohail Tanvir put the Hong Kong bowlers in their place.         
	Team India, on the other hand, were ruthless against the same opposition and rewrote the tournament record for the highest total  374 for four.         
	MoM Suresh Raina got his maiden ODI hundred (101, with the second fifty coming off a mere 16 balls) and Dhoni posted his first three-figure knock after 35 ODIs.         
	In the second session, leggie Piyush Chawla struck gold (or almost), returning career-best figures of four for 23. Others joined the party too as Hong Kong got hammered by 256 runs.         
	Our best margin (runs-wise) remains 257, versus Bermuda in the otherwise disastrous 2007 World Cup.         
	We wanted a good start... It was an opportunity to look at areas where we needed to get better... The openers began well and we rotated (the strike) in the middle overs... The slog was perfect, Dhoni remarked.         
	He added: When some team qualifies for a tournament then its assumed theyre good enough to be there... You dont look at how strong or weak the opposition is, you simply look to play good cricket.         
	Dhoni had words of praise for debutant Manpreet Singh Gony. He was up for it and was up to the mark...         
	About his own performance (four dismissals after the authoritative hundred), Dhoni had this to say: Feels good... Particularly getting those dismissals... The IPL had seen a lean period... Its good that the chances came my way today...         
	Looking ahead to Thursday, Dhoni felt both teams were well balanced and that the one which played better would carry forward points to the Super Four stage.         
	That, clearly, will be at the back of the minds of the captains.         
	Meanwhile, Irfan Pathan is likely to be rested yet again. He hasnt recovered from a right side strain.         
	Vice-captain Yuvraj Singh also didnt play against Hong Kong, but thats because he was rested.         
	Footnote: In an act of callousness, the Indian flag was missing from the panel outside the National Stadiums pavilion entrance till a TV channel caught that on camera. Its to be seen whether somebody is held accountable.

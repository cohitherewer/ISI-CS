The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The heat is on Ashraf
                                                                                                                                                                                                       The heat is on Ashraf
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            PCB chief Nasim Ashraf                           
	Calcutta: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf, obliged influential members of the Pakistan Peoples Party by withdrawing his multi-million Rupee suit against Shoaib Akhtar, albeit after an apology but sources insist he remains under pressure.         
	Dr Ashraf, after all, was hand-picked by President Pervez Musharraf  who isnt quite on the same wavelength as the present government  and, so, stands exposed as a target.         
	President Musharraf is the PCBs chief patron but is no longer on a strong wicket.         
	The heat is on Dr Ashraf The government has more important matters to deal with right now but it seems his exit is more or less confirmed Its largely a matter of when, a source told The Telegraph.         
	According to another source, former Pakistan batsman, selector and administrator Ijaz Butt is being talked about as a possible replacement. Apparently, hes close to many in the Peoples Party, which is calling the shots.         
	Outside the government, the chairmanship of the PCB is one of the most coveted posts.

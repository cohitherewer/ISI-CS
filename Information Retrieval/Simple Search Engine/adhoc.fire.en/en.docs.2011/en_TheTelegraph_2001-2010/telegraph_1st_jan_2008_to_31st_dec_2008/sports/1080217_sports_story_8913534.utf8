                                                   Excited to lead attack: Johnson
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Adelaide: Mitchell Johnson will operate with the new ball in one-day cricket for the first time this summer when Australia take on India at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday. The 26-year-old Queenslander is looking forward to leading the attack in Brett Lees absence.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Lee         
	Bretts having a well deserved rest, and Im excited to lead the attack for Australia. I dont think I am nervous. Im pretty relaxed, enjoying the cricket and looking forward to the responsibility. It is very important to have some time away during a busy summer. I had a break in the Twenty20 game (against India), which helped. Rest periods are very good for the bowlers.         
	On his own bowling         
	Im bowling better, I am really backing myself. When I had the new ball during the Tests, I had an opportunity to swing it. I was trying to swing it a little bit too much instead of the hitting the deck hard, which is what I want to do now.         
	On Lees absence         
	These are two very good sides. Our bowling strength is very good, we are fielding well at the moment and we back ourselves with the bat. It doesnt matter who we are playing, we are very confident about ourselves.         
	On Australias batting         
	Coming off a win against the Sri Lankans, we are ready to go out there and give it to India. We got off to a good start yesterday. Its just that in the middle period, we need to kick on. We will look to score a few more runs and keep wickets in hand. We hope the middle-order can chip in and we can put up a big score.         
	On if the batting failures put more pressure on the bowlers         
	I dont think there is any added pressure on the bowling. We have belief in our fielding too.         
	On a perfect farewell to Adam Gilchrist         
	It will be nice to send him off with a victory in the finals. It was quite an emotional feeling in the camp after his hundred at the Waca yesterday.

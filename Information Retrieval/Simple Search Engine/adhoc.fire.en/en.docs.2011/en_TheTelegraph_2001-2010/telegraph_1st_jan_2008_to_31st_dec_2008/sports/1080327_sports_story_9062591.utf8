The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Just shows that the ICL is there to stay: Kapil
                                                   Just shows that the ICL is there to stay: Kapil
  - Icon welcomes Mithuns involvement       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, who is one of the promising   players in the ICL    
	Calcutta: Mithun Chakrabortys desire to do a Shah Rukh Khan couldnt have come at a better time for the outlawed Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	It just shows that the ICL is there to stay... In fact, were looking at other celebrities to be associated with the other teams... I mean, an actor from the south could be involved with the Chennai Superstars, Kapil told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Wednesday evening, on the eve of a formal announcement regarding Mithuns takeover, so to say, of the Kolkata Tigers, Kapil added emotionally: The young players whove joined us are even being denied admission to colleges and universities...         
	How can that be done? Are we, in the ICL, doing anything wrong? If, yes, then Ill stop it all... The issue is simple: How can you prevent cricketers from playing cricket? Mujhe samajh mein nahin ata... How can you bully?         
	The ICL is in its first season and its latest competition will get over some days before the launch of the much-hyped Indian Premier League, which has the blessings of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	The BCCI, which got beaten by Zee (the ICL promoters) in getting a pro Twenty20 league off the ground, is of course desperate to keep even the remotest hint of competition a million miles away.         
	The Mithuns, though, could queer the pitch somewhat.

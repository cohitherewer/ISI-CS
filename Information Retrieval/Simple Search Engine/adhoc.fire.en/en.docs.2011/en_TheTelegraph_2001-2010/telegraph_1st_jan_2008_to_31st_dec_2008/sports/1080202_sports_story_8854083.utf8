	Melbourne: Australian skipper Michael Clarke put down his teams victory to the homework they had done on the Indian team. 
    
	We were very well prepared. We had done extensive preparation on the Indian team and our execution was spot on. We executed it the way we wanted it. 
    
	You would see such performance more and more from the Australian team. We want to be the best Twenty20 team in the world and we have just beaten the world champions, he said. 
    
	Man of the Match Clarke was ecstatic at having finally managed to upstage India in the shortest format of the game. 
    
	Retiring wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, for whom the match was a Twenty20 swan song, said he was relieved to be going out after beating India. Its nice that we have finally beaten India in Twenty20. Its nice to finish my (Twenty20) career with a win, he said. 
    
	Gilchrist also lavished praise on Michael Clarke for his stout leadership. Clarkes captaincy was fantastic. I think we are getting a glimpse what is there in the future, he said. 
    
	Gilchrist broke his bat during his knock of 25 off 22 balls and even though its a common occurrence in any batsmans career, the left-hander has more reasons than one to rue its loss.

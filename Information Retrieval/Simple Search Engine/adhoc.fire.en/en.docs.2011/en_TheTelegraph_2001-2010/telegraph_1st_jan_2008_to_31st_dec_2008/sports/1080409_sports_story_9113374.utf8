	New Delhi: Indias Davis Cup captain Leander Paes is confident that the hosts will put up a brave fight in the upcoming Asia-Oceania group-I tie against Japan starting here from April 11.         
	Paes, who in his illustrious Davis Cup career have beaten many higher ranked players, did not read too much into the superior ranked Japanese and hinted it would count for little when the tie starts.         
	Its different playing in Davis Cup. It takes to be a super athlete to perform in the Davis Cup, Paes told reporters after the practice session at the National Sports Club of India here.         
	Paes joined the camp on Tuesday and partnered left-hander Divij Sharan in a long practice session with Rohan Bopanna and national champion Ashutosh Singh.         
	The skipper appeared satisfied with his fitness and even was not worried about Bopannas knee injury.         
	The last four weeks have been good on the (ATP) tour. I am feeling great and there is no problem with my ankle, Paes said.         
	Talking about Bopanna, he said, He looks good and is working hard. Our support staff taking care of everything, he said.         
	Happy with Tuesdays practice session, Paes said: I am happy all the boys are practising hard. We had a couple of sets of doubles practice as well as singles.         
	Meanwhile, the rift between Paes and his teammates seemed to have been put behind with Bopanna seen exchanging smiles with his captain during the session.           (PTI)

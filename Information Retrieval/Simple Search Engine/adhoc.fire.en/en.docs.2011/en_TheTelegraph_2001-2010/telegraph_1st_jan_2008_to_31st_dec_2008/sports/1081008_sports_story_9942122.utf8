The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nalbandian moves to Round II
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nalbandian moves to Round II
                      
	Stockholm: Top seed David Nalbandian barely broke sweat when he defeated American Bobby Reynolds 6-1, 6-1 in the first round of the Stockholm Open on Tuesday.         
	The Argentine world No.7, making his first tournament appearance in the Swedish capital as he chases a spot in the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai, was too solid from the baseline to be threatened by Reynolds.         
	Nalbandian, who became the tournaments top seed following Swiss Roger Federers withdrawal, needed just 55 minutes to win.         
	He next faces either Frenchman Nicolas Mahut or Swedish wild card Joachim Johansson who play later on Tuesday.         
	Johansson, a former top ten player, announced his comeback from retirement last week.         
	Earlier, second seed Mario Ancic beat Belgian Olivier Rochus 7-6, 6-2.

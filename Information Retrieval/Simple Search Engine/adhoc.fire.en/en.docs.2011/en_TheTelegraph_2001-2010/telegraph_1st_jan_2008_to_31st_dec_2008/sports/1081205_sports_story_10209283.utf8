	Mumbai: Rajasthan Royals believe that the presence of Pakistan players in their team would not be an issue in the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attacks and that Indian fans would appreciate good cricket irrespective of the players nationality.         
	We have no apprehensions about having or being represented by Pakistani players, Ravi Krishnan, vice-chairman of the IPLs Jaipur franchise, told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	Indian fans are not only the most passionate but they are also the most educated and most tolerant. They, more than any other fan, support great cricket.         
	Rajasthan Royals squad includes Pakistan cricketers Younis Khan, Kamran Akmal and Sohail Tanvir. A few former Pakistan players have called for their compatriots to boycott the IPL and also the ICL.

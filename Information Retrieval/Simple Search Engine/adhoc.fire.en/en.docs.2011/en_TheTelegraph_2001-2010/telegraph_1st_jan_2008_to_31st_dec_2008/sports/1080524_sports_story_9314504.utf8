The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punjab keep winning run
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Punjab keep winning run
                      
	Mohali: Kings XI Punjab beat Deccan Chargers by six wickets in an inconsequential match of the IPL on Friday.         
	Despite having little to play for in this dead rubber, Kings XI Punjab put on an imposing performance against the Deccan Chargers and gave the other teams plenty to think about ahead of the semi-finals.         
	Punjab openers Shaun Marsh (60 off 46 balls) and Kumara Sangakkara (50 off 25 balls) put on 50 in 3.5 overs and they never looked back.         
	Earlier, riding a spirited opening by skipper Adam Gilchrist, Deccan Chargers reached 175.         
	Gilchrist hit a 42-ball 50, aided by six boundaries and a huge six, and also paired up with South African Herschelle Gibbs to carve out an impressive 79-run partnership to lay a strong foundation for the Hyderabad team.         
	Gibbs scored 44 off 34 balls, before spinner Gagandeep Singh bowled him out after Yuvraj Singh won the toss and put the visitors in to bat.         
	After both the openers were back to the pavilion, the momentum of the Deccans innings was maintained by Rohit Sharma, who came out with an impressive half century in just 27 deliveries, hitting out three boundaries and four sixes.         
	The Kings XI Punjab bowlers proved to be expensive. Sreesanth and VRV Singh gave away 29 and 40 runs, respectively.         
	Besides, Sreesanth and VRV, Ramesh Powar and Gagandeep Singh managed to get one wicket each, though they failed to keep a check on the runs.         
	Deccan were aided by some shoddy work by the Punjab fielders.         
	VRV half-heartedly tried to go for a catch at long-off Rohit. That dropped catch proved costly for Punjab as Rohit hit 32 off two overs soon after the reprieve.

	Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) could move the Champions Trophy from Pakistan because of security concerns and will continue to monitor the situation before making a decision on the fate of the September tournament.         
	The ICC will not compromise (on) the safety and security of any individual at one of its tournaments and if it is not appropriate to play in any country then we will not do so, the governing bodys CEO Haroon Lorgat said in a statement on Sunday.         
	Our security consultants have been working with the Pakistan authorities during the Asia Cup (which ended on Sunday), assessing security, and will report back as soon as possible with their views.         
	At this stage we are working towards the Champions Trophy being held in Pakistan in September, he added.         
	Lorgat confirmed that during the ICC annual conference week here, a security process had been agreed upon for the September tournament spread across Rawalpindi, Karachi and Lahore.         
	Pakistan has been hit by a series of suicide bombings since last year and although the situation had eased since Februarys general election, eight people were killed in such an attack in the capital Islamabad on Sunday, while there were blasts in Karachi on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smriti shares ninth spot
                                                   Smriti shares ninth spot
                      
	Gurgaon: Smriti Mehras hopes of winning her maiden womens Indian Open are virtually over after the US-based Indian golfer returned her second successive round of one-over 73 to slip to tied 9th on Thursday.         
	Thailands Pornanong Phatlum shot her second straight round of 70 to open up a two-shot lead in the $120,000 event.         
	Chinas Wang Chung (142) shot the days lowest total of 69 to grab the second spot while Japans Yuki Sakurai put herself in sight of a win she carded 70 for a 36-hole total of 143.         
	Smriti had three birdies but her card was blighted by a bogey quartet.         
	Compatriot Irina Brar was a big disappointment also as she carded a horrendous nine-over 81 for a two-day total of 157 to join Nalini Singh (76) at tied 35th. One shot behind, at tied 37th, was Sanya Sharma who carded a 78.         
	Amateurs Sharmila Nicollet (73) and Tanya Wadhwa (75) improved their positions and share the 21st place at 152.           (PTI)

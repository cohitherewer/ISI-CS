	Uefa denies rumour  
	Vienna: Uefa officials on Saturday brushed off the latest speculation about Euro 2012, denying that Spain had been approached as a possible replacement host if infrastructure problems persisted with Poland and Ukraine.  
	The co-hosts face huge challenges in upgrading road and rail links, along with modernising airports and building hotels. Concerns have grown in particular over delays in the reconstruction of Kievs Olympic stadium.                 
	Turkish task  
	Geneva: Three of Turkeys players will take time out from preparations for Sundays crucial group A match against the Czech Republic to sit the national university entrance exam, a spokesman said.  
	Striker Semih Senturk, central defender Servet Cetin and left-back Ugur Boral will take the three-hour, multiple choice exam at the team hotel on Sunday, the spokesman said.                 
	Hagi appeal  
	Bucharest: Romanian media on Saturday both praised and damned Adrian Mutu after scoring a goal and missing a penalty in a 1-1 draw against Italy at Euro 2008  but he won backing from former great Gheorghe Hagi.  
	Mutu must forget as soon as possible that he failed to convert his penalty, Hagi said. Im sure that Mutu will play his best match so far against the Netherlands.                 
	Trouble free  
	Berne: Police in Berne reported a boisterous but generally trouble-free night after mass crowds of Dutch Euro 2008 supporters once again put on a huge party in the compact city centre.

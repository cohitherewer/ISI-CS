	Darwin: India finished last again in the four nation hockey tournament, losing 3-4 to South Korea in the bronze medal play-off of the sec- ond leg of the event on Sun- day.         
	India were the superior side in the first half but the usual script of their forwards failing to finish off continued as the two sides went into the break at 2-2.         
	The Koreans, who were the runners-up to Australia in the first leg in Perth, took control of the second half and shut the Indians out.         
	For India, captain Tushar Khandekar (12th minute) and V. Raghunath (28th and 70th) found the target while B. Kim (16th, 68th) and Hye Sung-hyun (19th, 49th) were the scorers for the winners.         
	Earlier, China matched Australia in all departments of the game only to lose 8-9 via penalty shootout after the two sides were locked 2-2 in regulation and extra time.

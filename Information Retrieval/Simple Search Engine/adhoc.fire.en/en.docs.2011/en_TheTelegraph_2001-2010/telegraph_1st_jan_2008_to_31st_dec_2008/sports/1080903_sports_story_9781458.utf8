                                                                                                                                                                                                           I dont think Andrew Symonds will quit, says John Buchanan
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -   Former Australia coach bats for the beleaguered allrounder       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                File picture of John Buchanan with Andrew Symonds       
	Calcutta: John Buchanan, who achieved phenomenal success as Australias coach from late 1999 till early 2007, has come out in allrounder (and fellow-Queenslander) Andrew Symonds support.  
	His stand is in sharp contrast to that taken by just about everybody else.   
	Buchanan, who is in India talent-hunting for the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders, spoke to The Telegraph from Ahmedabad on Tuesday evening.  
	Incidentally, Buchanan could be in Calcutta on Wednesday.   
	The following are excerpts  
	On Symonds bizarre behaviour in Darwin last Friday  
	Look, Im not going to comment specifically, for I dont know what actually happened... Ive been so far away from the scene of action hellip; But, yes, I know Andrew very well and have sent him a message of support... Hes a person who is committed to playing for Australia... He loves doing so and I hope hell be able to work through this.  
	The gist of his message   
	I didnt say much, really... Basically that I was there if he needed a friendly face or a friendly word...   
	Whether, if hed still been the coach, he wouldve sent Symonds home (Brisbane) for going fishing instead of attending a team meeting  
	Again, I cant comment specifically as Im not sure what exactly happened... I wouldnt necessarily believe every word thats been written and there could well be more to the Darwin incident hellip; Thats my answer.   
	Symonds commitment being questioned  
	Having worked with him for a number of years, first at Queensland and then in the Australian team, what I can reaffirm is that he loves the game and definitely loves playing for Australia... Obviously, something wasnt right (in Darwin), which is why it has come to this stage.  
	Speculation that Symonds may quit  
	Ill be disappointed if Andrew does take that decision... In fact, I dont think that will be the case... Dont think hell quit... Having said that, if he does, then it wont be because of that one incident... Hes a very private person, yet loves being around the game and around teammates... Andrew fought long and hard to get into the Australian team and hes not a person to relinquish that lightly or easily... Today, he (only) needs to sort things out.   
	On Symonds mental toughness  
	Hes his own person and, to be your own person, you need to be mentally strong... Hes good at reading people and hes good at reading situations hellip;  
	Whether hed ever seen Symonds as a problem child   
	Never... Every player has to deal with issues, personal or cricket-related, throughout his career... Sometimes, there could even be a conflict with the norms and rules of a team environment... Ive known Andrew to be honest... Known him to be upfront... He expects others too to behave the same way and hed be the first to admit it if he fell out of line... He has great team values and personal values.... Andrew has an incredible wealth of skills and talent... He needs to bring that to the team hellip; Hes a tremendous athlete as well hellip;   
	The 2005 incident, when Symonds reported drunk for an ODI against Bangladesh (in England)  
	Hed been out for the night with some of the boys... It had been one players birthday and one was injured... (Adds laughing) He managed to stay out longer than the rest!  
	Handling Symonds  
	Be it at Queensland or in the Australian dressing room, I didnt have to treat him differently... Of course, we had our run-ins at different stages... Bottomline is that Andrew has an honest way of dealing with situations and, at times, that could land him in trouble.  
	On the way forward for Cricket Australia (CA) and Symonds  
	Its not for me to say whats the way forward... However, I hope Andrew will be back playing his best cricket soon.  
	Finally, whether Symonds has responded to his gesture of support  
	Well, text messages have gone back and forth... My impression is that Andrew is in control of the situation hellip;

                                                   Chopra slips to tied 32 

           
	Honolulu: Daniel Chopra had a poor second round of one-over 71 which saw the Indian-born Swede slip to tied 32nd after Day II of the Sony Open on Friday. 
    
	He ended Day I in fifth place after a sizzling four-under 66, but three bogeys on his way back in the second round gave him a two-day total of three-under 137. He finds a place in the crowd of 16 who share 32nd spot. 
    
	After he parred the first five holes, Chopra made back-to-back bogeys but fired an eagle on the par-five ninth to take the turn at par. 
    
	He resumed by picking up a shot to go one-under and slotted his second birdie on the 18th but bogeys on the 11th, 14th and the 17th derailed his campaign. 
    
	South Koreas K.J. Choi fired a five-under 65 for a 11-under 129 to maintain sole lead.

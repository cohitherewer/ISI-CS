The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Matthew Hayden admits being insensitive
                                                   Matthew Hayden admits being insensitive
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australian opener Matthew Hayden has admitted being insensitive in making the obnoxious little weed remark against Harbhajan Singh but said it was not against the spirit of cricket and did warrant a reprimand.         
	I can see that my comments were insensitive but they were not intended to be denigrating and especially not contrary to the spirit of cricket, Hayden said. The cricket environment I have grown up with is probably a little bit different from today, the 37-year-old cricketer was quoted as saying by the Daily Telegraph.         
	Hayden expressed anguish at being reprimanded by Cricket Australia (CA) for his behaviour. It saddens me that my employer has to discipline me for my behaviour, Hayden said.         
	CA rules do not allow contracted players to make comments against opponent players or the board and hence charged Hayden with breach of its code of behaviour, although let off with only a reprimand.         
	Meanwhile, Australian sporting greats have come down heavily at CA, describing them as a bunch of cowards for reprimanding Hayden who just called a spade a spade.         
	South Africa batting legend Barry Richards said cricket was being made to look stupid. The way they (CA officials) are going they will be having tea and cucumber sandwiches on the pitch. Test cricket has got to be about some sort of clash, Richards said.         
	Captain Ricky Ponting said: It was a pretty flippant remark. I know that Haydos, when he said that, wouldnt have thought in his wildest dreams that it could have escalated into what it has.         
	Former captain Mark Taylor feels Hayden was lucky to get away with just a reprimand. I really hope he can put this behind him, because I think the other night, to be totally honest, he got away lightly, Taylor said.

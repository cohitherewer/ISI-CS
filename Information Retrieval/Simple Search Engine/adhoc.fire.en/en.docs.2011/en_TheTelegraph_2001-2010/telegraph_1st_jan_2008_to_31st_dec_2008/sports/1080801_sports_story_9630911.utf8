            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The differences within the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) appointed ad hoc committee on hockey stood exposed on Thursday when it decided to remove Aslam Sher Khan as the chairman of the selection committee.         
	The ad hoc committee, which met at the Olympic Bhawan to discuss the modalities for the improvement of the game, failed to come up with any concrete suggestion but replaced Aslam Sher Khan with former India captain Ajitpal Singh.         
	While sources revealed that the change was made after a couple of selection committee members demanded Khans removal, IOA president Suresh Kalmadi said it was done on the basis of rotation policy.         
	Addressing a press conference after the meeting of the ad hoc committee with former Olympians, Kalmadi said: Ajitpal Singh is the new chairman of the selection committee. It has been done keeping in mind the rotation policy.         
	The meeting, which was attended by top former Olympians like Nandy Singh, Gurbux Singh, M.P. Ganesh, M.K. Kaushik, Ajitpal Singh and Jagbir Singh, could not decide on the panel of coaches including the national coach.         
	Instead, they drew up a list of 20 coaches, Kalmadi said.

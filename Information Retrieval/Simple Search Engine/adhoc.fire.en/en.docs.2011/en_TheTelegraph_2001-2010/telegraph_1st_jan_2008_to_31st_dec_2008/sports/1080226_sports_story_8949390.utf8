                                                     SGM set to be a stormy affair
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jagmohan Dalmiya has kept open the option of attending the SGM                           
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengals (CAB) special general body meeting on Tuesday is set to be a stormy affair with the opposition submitting a memorandum demanding that 70 per cent of the Rs 10 crore grant be distributed among the 121 affiliated units.         
	The memorandum, signed by 64 of the 94 club representatives, has been addressed to the joint secretaries of the association. The 18 district bodies and eight universities  Office Sports Federation is the only other affiliated unit  will decide separately on their stand.         
	The SGM has been called to discuss the hosting of Indian Premier League matches at the Eden.         
	It is a matter of regret that for the first time Bengal has been relegated from the Elite group to the Plate group in Ranji Trophy It is of utmost importance to bring back the glory of Bengal cricket We, the affiliated units, feel that this is an all-time opportunity for the CAB to further develop the game across the state by utilising this grant the memorandum said.         
	We propose that 70 per cent of this grant should be distributed equally among its affiliated units for upgradation and maintenance of the available infrastructure as well as for proper functioning of the units. The balance should be utilised for procuring and/or purchasing grounds in all the districts of the state.         
	In a way, the SGM promises to be a prelude to the annual general meeting in July. If the opposition can muster a two-thirds majority on the floor, it will be a loss of face for the Prasun Mukherjee-led ruling group.         
	The CAB has to confirm to the BCCI by Tuesday evening on the status of hosting matches.         
	The buzz is that Jagmohan Dalmiya will attend the meeting and the ruling group could go out of its way to ensure that he is not allowed to speak. If the bit about Dalmiya not being allowed to speak gets confirmed overnight, then one can be more or less certain that he will actually attend the meeting  if only to prove a point.         
	Till late on Monday, though, the former president hadnt made up his mind. A lot of people have approached me But to be honest, at the moment, I havent made up my mind, he said.         
	Despite being the elected president, the BCCI expulsion forced Dalmiya to stay away from the CAB. He has not been there since December 26 2006. He sent his resignation to the working committee the following day.         
	The Calcutta high court subsequently stayed the expulsion and ruled that it was based on insufficient documents. The court also said that he was free to attend meetings and fight elections.         
	Dalmiyas presence on Tuesday will certainly give a fillip to the opposition. At a press conference, former joint secretary Gautam Das Gupta said: The house has to go by what the majority of the members feel. All 121 units will benefit from it and I dont think anyone will object. It will be open for discussion. We all want the matches to be held here.         
	He added that they would also demand tabling the BCCI guidelines under which the matches were being held.         
	Mukherjee didnt wish to comment. This is only a SGM. Theres nothing to say. Whatever has to be discussed will be done at the meeting, the CAB president said.         
	But the hour-long office-bearers meeting in his chamber, the impromptu huddles and discussions in every nook and corner suggested that the ruling group was taking it seriously.         
	They seem confident of dismissing the challenge posed by the opposition. No one was willing to go on record but it is unlikely that they will concede to the oppositions demands.         
	A formula has already been worked out to solve the ticket impasse  a total of 5000 tickets would be earmarked for the different categories of members to ensure that each gets to watch at least one match.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Graeme Smith at nets on Tuesday                           
	Chennai: Graeme Smith exuded confidence on the eve of the series on Tuesday. He feels the South Africans have the ability and experience to tame the Indians in their own den.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Stiffest test         
	I think every Test series we played this year has had its challenges. Going to Pakistan, we had a lot of things to face. Now that weve won there, its easy to say it was not that hard. In fairness, India is one of the most experienced teams in world cricket now. They have a team thats well balanced, a team thats been around for a number of years. Lot of impressive names in that line-up...         
	The selection controversy         
	Getting on the plane and coming here has been a bonus for us its been a way to get away from all that as much as we can. Most of us are focused on getting prepared for this Test. As a team weve dealt with it in a mature manner.         
	The conditions         
	Chennai generally is a pretty hot place, we knew it was going to be warm. Ive had a look at the wicket again Im sure its going to spin at some stage. Obviously for us, for both teams, its the heat that is a worrying factor. How we manage through the next five days is going to be crucial.         
	How confident he is         
	I think you have got to have a team capable of winning a series away from home. I believe we have the team, enough experience. Obviously some young guys have come to India for the first time but they are really exciting prospects. So it will be interesting to see how they go. Were a confident team at the moment. Theres been a lot of talk of youth and experience in India at the moment. For us, were just focused on how to beat India.         
	On Dale Steyn         
	Hes pretty motivated. Our whole attack has done well, allowed Steyn to bowl the way he does. Weve spoken of game plans and thats what hes focused on. Hes focused on how to get people out and what he needs to do to do well here. The thing about Dale is hes really motivated. And one or two Indian batsmen have made comments about him that have motivated him a bit more.         
	Gary Kirsten and Paddy Upton         
	Its not something that worries us hugely. As a person we respect Gary, certainly I do. Hes a guy who impacted me a lot as a young guy, a wonderful man. Its a challenge for him to come into the Indian set-up how hes going to impact them, how hes going to make a difference.

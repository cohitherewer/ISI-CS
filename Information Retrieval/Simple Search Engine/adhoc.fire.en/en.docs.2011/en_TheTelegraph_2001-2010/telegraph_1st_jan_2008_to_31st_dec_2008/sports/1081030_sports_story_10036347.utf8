                                                                                                                                                                                                     Party falls flat after row 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                       
	A cocktail party due to be hosted Wednesday night by Sir Allen Stanford for the England team was cancelled on Tuesday as the fall-out from the embarrassing incident involving the teams wives and girlfriends rumbles on.         
	Stanford was forced into issuing a humiliating apology to the England players on Monday after he was shown on television flirting with their partners. At one stage the 58-year-old divorcee was shown sitting Emily Prior, the wife of wicketkeeper Matt, on his knee before hugging and grabbing other WAGs. This has highlighted their desire to keep their partners out of the limelight.

                                                   Bhajji is keen to move on
                      
	Jalandhar: All the controversies and bitterness generated during the tour of Australia should be buried now that the series is over and India had emerged victorious, according to Harbhajan Singh who played a key role in the historic triumph.         
	Harbhajan, who was at the centre of most of the controversies during the ill-tempered tour, said the teams performance in Australia has proved that India could become a major force in world cricket.         
	The bitter memories should be buried. It is all over with our win. We must concentrate on playing cricket and it should be played in good spirit, he told reporters on Friday.         
	They (Australians) tried to upset our players but were not ready to tolerate anything. We were brave enough to give them a befitting reply through cricket, the off-spinner who was involved in a racism row with Andrew Symonds, said.         
	Australians initiated the comments. Some of them were so bad that I cannot even share it with you. We were there to play cricket, he said.         
	Elated by the Indian teams performance Down Under, Harbhajan said he had no doubt that India would soon become a dominating force.         
	Of course If we play like this, we will be the No.1 team in Test as well as ODIs. We can beat any team with such a strong side. We look forward to playing good cricket, he said.         
	Harbhajan did not hide his disappointment when asked about racist allegations levelled against him by Symonds.         
	I was shocked and surprised when I came to know about such allegations. If I had I done something wrong, I would have been punished. But ultimately truth prevailed and I was acquitted, he said.         
	On facing the fire from Australian media, he said, I was not there to make friends but to play cricket. Australia are a very good side and dominate all teams. This win is not only for me but for the team and the country.         
	Harbahajan also hailed the under-19 World Cup winning team for their achievement.         
	I congratulate the under-19 team. It is good news for Indian cricket that in coming years we are going to have very good youngsters in the team.         
	Harbhajan was confident that India would continue their good show in the upcoming series versus South Africa at home.         
	We are hopeful of winning the series against South Africa. And if we do that we will be the No.1. (PTI)

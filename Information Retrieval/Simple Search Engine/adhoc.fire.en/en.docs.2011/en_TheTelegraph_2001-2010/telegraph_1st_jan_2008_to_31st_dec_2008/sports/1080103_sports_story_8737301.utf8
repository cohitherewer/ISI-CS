The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ive been robbed, says Gatlin
                                                  Ive been robbed, says Gatlin
                  Justin Gatlin                     
	Los Angeles: Sprinter Justin Gatlin got his doping ban reduced, but not by enough to make him eligible to defend his Olympic 100m title this year.         
	An arbitration panel, in a ruling released Tuesday, reduced the 25-year-old sprinters potential eight-year ban to four. With the ban set to expire May 24, 2010, it means Gatlin would be on the sidelines for the Beijing Olympics in August.         
	But the panel left open the possibility of a further reduction.         
	The panel ruled Gatlin committed a doping offence when he tested positive for excessive testosterone in April 2006, but the sprinters first doping offence in 2001 troubled the group.         
	If that doping violation were erased, that would make Gatlins 2006 case his first offence, clearing the way for a further reduced ban. First doping offences often result in a two-year ban, which would make him eligible to run in May, a month before the US Olympic trials.         
	Im a fighter and Ive been a fighter from the very beginning and Im going to continue to fight, Gatlin told The Washington Post on Tuesday. I know in my heart I havent done anything wrong. I have been robbed. I have been cheated of an opportunity to finish my career.         
	Gatlin has six months to appeal.         
	The panel called the circumstances surrounding Gatlins first offence the real dilemma.         
	As a 19-year-old competitor at the world junior championships, Gatlin tested positive for amphetamines, part of a prescribed medication he was taking for attention deficit disorder. Gatlin stopped taking the medicine a few days before the competition, but it didnt clear his system, according to the case records. He received a two-year ban.         
	The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the sports world governing body, later reinstated Gatlin after he had served only one year of the ban but never specifically said Gatlin had no fault in the case.         
	The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) characterised Gatlins reinstatement as a reduction in the ban whereas Gatlin contended it vacated the finding of a doping offence.         
	The panel said Gatlin could go through an appeals process to seek a finding of no fault in the first case or ask the IAAF for a clarification on its earlier ruling.         
	The actions of the IAAF clearly suggest at a minimum, a finding of no significant fault in 2001, the panel said. However, there is no evidence from which this panel may determine that a finding of no fault under the current Wada (World Anti-Doping Agency) standard was made or could be inferred.         
	No significant fault would leave Gatlin still somewhat responsible for the positive test, and it would remain a first offence. A no fault finding would erase the offence.         
	A family member who said he was speaking on Gatlins behalf said the fight is not over for us.         
	We feel we were wrongly done, said the man who answered the phone at Gatlins parents home but declined to give his name. He has a disability. The family is going to sit down. Were going to decide where to go next.         
	The ruling means Gatlin must wait to regain his world record in the 100 meters. He shared the record of 9.77 seconds with Jamaicas Asafa Powell. Since then, Powell has improved the record, finishing in 9.74 seconds last September.

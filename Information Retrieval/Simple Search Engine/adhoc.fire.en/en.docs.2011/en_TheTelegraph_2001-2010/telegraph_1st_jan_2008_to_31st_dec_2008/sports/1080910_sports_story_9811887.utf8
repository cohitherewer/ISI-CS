The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diwakar survives a scare
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Diwakar survives a scare
                      
	Bathinda: Olympian Diwakar Prasad (57kg) rode his luck and resilience to progress to the quarter finals of the 55th Senior National Mens Boxing Championship on Tuesday.         
	Diwakar survived a momentary lapse of concentration, which could have ended his campaign in the tournament, which saw four Jharkhand pugilists barred from competing for not getting their NOCs from the Services.         
	Diwakar, who missed last years nationals due to a bout of typhoid, beat local favourite Mahmood Khan 16-4.         
	Leading 11-0 and cruising on way to an easy victory at the end of the second round, a careless Diwakar let his guard down prematurely during a standing count in the penultimate round.         
	It all started with a powerful uppercut struck by Mahmood following which the referee separated the two boxers for a standing count on Diwakar.         
	Even before the referee had restarted the bout, a defenceless Diwakar was struck yet another strong blow by Mahmood. The straight hit could have knocked the daylights out of the boxer, who was left to thank his stars as the round ended moments later, giving him time to recover.         
	The effect of the blows, however, were apparent in the final round, where Diwakar landed just one scoring punch and was mostly on the defensive against his desperate opponent.         
	In the championship race, defenders Railways, suffered a setback as their bantam-weight challenger M.Suresh bowed out after a stunning 15-29 loss to Meghalyas Torak Kharpran.

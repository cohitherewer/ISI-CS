	Hong Kong, Aug 14 (AP): A police spokesman says Hong Kong police have dispatched bomb squads to investigate two suspicious objects found in the Kowloon peninsula.Edwin Hung says the teams investigated items found in a flower bed near a hotel and outside a building on a major thoroughfare, Nathan Road, on Thursday.         
	Hong Kong police say the item found near the hotel was a mobile phone wrapped with wires, and was apparently intended as a prank, according the Radio RTHKs Web site.         
	Hung said he had no more details on either object.

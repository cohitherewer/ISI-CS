The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahesh dust swirls around Leander
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mahesh dust swirls around Leander
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi: Indian captain Leander Paes on Friday vehemently denied saying that agreeing to play with Mahesh Bhupathi in doubles was the worst decision of his career.         
	Fresh controversy erupted in Indian tennis on the opening day of the Davis Cup tie against Japan when Paes was quoted in an interview saying that he regretted sacrificing his singles career for Bhupathi.         
	While Paes  who arrived 70 minutes late for the mandatory news conference after the days play  said he was quoted wrongly, the All India Tennis Association (AITA) officials quickly went into a huddle trying to defuse the tension.         
	In the interview to a website, Paes is alleged to have said: Mahesh is a lot junior to me and he was never a good singles player. During my junior Wimbledon years, he used to travel with me and I took care of him. When I used to go inside the Wimbledon stadium, Mahesh didnt have a pass, so I used to get in and throw the pass across the fence so that he could get entry. I used to give him my food coupons and also made him stay with me.         
	When I was at the top of my singles career, I actually sacrificed my rankings to play Satellite and Future tournaments with him (Bhupathi) so that he could be at par with me which would help us get entry into ATP tournaments. Even though everyone advised me not to pick up a rookie player like Mahesh, my instincts told me to take him along.         
	Now, when I look back, I regret the fact that I sacrificed my singles career for him. I had won the Pilot Pen International tournament beating the top players of the world, incl- uding Pete Sampras and reached a world ranking of 73 in 1998, added Paes.         
	Going by my performance then, I should have focused on singles. Opting to play doubles with Mahesh was probably the worst decision of my playing career, said Paes in the interview.         
	When asked about his comments, Paes, who will be partnering Bhupathi in the vital doubles against Japan on Saturday, said he was quoted wrongly in the interview.         
	I havent read the interview yet, but from what I have heard, it is simply silly. I cherish my doubles partnership with Mahesh and at no point of time did I say that I regret playing with him. All I said was that I regret giving up my singles career but it had nothing to do with Mahesh.         
	I spoke to him about this during the practice and mentioned to him that I had been quoted out of context. This is the only thing I can do to clear the air, he added.         
	Bhupathi, when contacted, refused to comment on the subject. At the moment, we are in the midst of an important Davis Cup tie. According to AITA rules, no one in the squad is allowed to speak to the media except the captain. If I have to say anything, I will say it later.

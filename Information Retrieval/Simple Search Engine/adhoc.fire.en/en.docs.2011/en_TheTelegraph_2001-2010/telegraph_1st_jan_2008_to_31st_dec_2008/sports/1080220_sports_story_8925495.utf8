The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India get the timing right
                                                     Team India get the timing right
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dhoni                           
	Calcutta: Team Indias two-wicket win at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday not only boosted their chances of making the best-of-three tri-series finals, but ensured that the players auction of the Indian Premier League (IPL) didnt get under way hours after yet another defeat.         
	The eight franchise owners couldve been severely embarrassed putting thousands of dollars on a bunch of non-performers.         
	The IPL auction, a buzz-creating first, is slated to begin in Mumbai at 11.00am and could continue for as long as 12 hours.         
	As it turned out, the two who wouldnt have lost a cent  captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and vice-captain Yuvraj Singh  are the ones who played the biggest hand in beating Sri Lanka.         
	Just about one may say, but the bottomline is that we got four points.         
	Given that The Telegraphs sources have confirmed Dhoni and Yuvraj have been at the forefront of the lets-move-forward-with-youngsters-only drive, they actually helped score another point too.         
	Indeed, soon after Yuvraj walked in (three down for 35), a section of the turnout began displaying an emotional banner: Old is Gold  Dada, Dravid, Laxman  Bring them back in the ODIs.         
	Another loss and more such banners wouldve begun to surface.         
	It was two years ago, on the tour of Pakistan, that Dhoni and Yuvraj (both held no position then) forged partnerships which made a difference. In Lahore, at the National Stadium in Karachi         
	There have been other contributions of note, but given the larger picture Dhoni and Yuvraj have in mind, the one on Tuesday (no more than 59 in terms of cold runs) will probably be significant with a capital S.         
	What is, of course, remarkable is that captaincy has changed Dhonis approach  to batting, at least.         
	Dhoni hasnt lost the skills of a finisher, rather hes got matured. Testimony being his unbeaten 50 at Sri Lankas expense.         
	Forget a six, Dhoni didnt even hit a four! Moreover, he took the singles, twos and threes despite again being bothered by cramps.         
	No wonder Dhonis getting high marks as captain.

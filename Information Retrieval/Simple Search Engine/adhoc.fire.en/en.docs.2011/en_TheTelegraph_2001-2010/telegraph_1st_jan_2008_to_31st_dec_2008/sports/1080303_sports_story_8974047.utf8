                                                   Kapur: Im unsatisfied
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	Gurgaon: It was a good week for Indian golf at the DLF Golf and Country Club as four Indians finished in top 20 in the star-studded $.2.5 million Johnnie Walker Classic.         
	Shiv Kapur was the best finisher with a fifth place. Struck by viral fever at the start of the tournament, Kapur at one stage even contemplated pulling out.         
	I cant say I am satisfied as you always say you can do better, said Kapur. But it is a bit of redemption from the Indian Masters.         
	Its nice that I came out to play well and I had a chance to win. Only if you win, you can be satisfied. I feel my game is in the right direction and that week will come around. I am happy but not satisfied.         
	If someone had told me at the start of the week that I would shoot 14-under I would have laughed, but golf is a funny game. Still it feels great to have a high finish.         
	Randhawa, who finished eighth, said: I was close but I am sure things will come around soon. I could have done better. I am sure things would improve in the coming weeks.         
	As for rankings, I dont think much, I just need to play golf and I am working on a few things, Randhawa said.         
	After three days of modest golf, Jeev Milkha Singh finally came up with an improved performance as he fired a 69 to finish tied 11th.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Isinbayeva completes hattrick
                                                   Isinbayeva completes hattrick
                      
	Valencia: Ethiopian long distance specialist Meseret Defar and Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva won their third consecutive world indoor titles on Saturday.         
	Defar produced a devastating last-lap burst to see off compatriot Meselech Melkamu and complete a hattrick in the womens 3,000 metres, while Isinbayeva claimed her third indoor gold with a leap of 4.75 metres in the pole vault.         
	Jennifer Stuczynski of the United States also cleared 4.75 but had to settle for silver on the countback while Brazilian Fabiana Murer took the bronze.         
	Olympic and world 5,000 champion Defar ran a near perfect race, biding her time as she tucked in behind the leaders in the early stages and stepped up a gear just before the last lap to win in eight minutes 38.79 seconds ahead of Melkamu.         
	Ethiopias Deresse Mekonnen had an anxious wait before finally being adjudged to have won the mens 1,500 metres. He crossed the line first in 3 minutes 38.23 but was initially disqualified for stepping off the track after colliding with New Zealander Nicholas Willis. However, the appeals jury decided the Ethiopian was not at fault and he was later reinstated as the winner while Willis remained disqualified.         
	There were surprises in the mens and womens 60 metres hurdles with hot favourites Dayron Robles and Susanna Kallur making early exits. (REUTERS)

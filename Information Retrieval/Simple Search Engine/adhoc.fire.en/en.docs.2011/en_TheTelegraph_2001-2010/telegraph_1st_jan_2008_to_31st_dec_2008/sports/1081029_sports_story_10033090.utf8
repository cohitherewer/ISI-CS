The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Britain leads the way in epic battle of speed with Brazil
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Britain leads the way in epic battle of speed with Brazil
    - Hamilton, Massa face off in Sao Paulo with the Briton needing a top-5 finish to clinch title           Brendan Gallagher            Lewis Hamilton                                 
	Although we like to somehow create the comforting illusion that a great footballing rivalry exists between us and the Brazilians, in truth, that notion is the product of our rather fevered imaginations or, dare one mention it, media hype. We share the dream, and the blame, equally.         
	The iconic picture of Bobby Moore and Pele shaking hands and exchanging shirts at the 1970 Mexico World Cup suggests yet another meeting of equals. But, lest we forget, Brazil won that pool game 1-0 and went on to win the Jules Rimet trophy in magnificent style. As they have on five occasions to our one. Not to mention two losing finals as well.         
	But Formula One? Thats a very different matter. Events in Sao Paulo this weekend, with Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa going head to head for the world title, will be the continuation of an epic, if unlikely, sporting rivalry that has livened up the F1 scene for much of its existence.         
	And this time Britain  all our racers, not least proud Scots Sir Jackie Stewart and Jim Clark, who did it for GB as well as their trade teams  have their noses well in front. Since Mike Hawthorn started the trend 50 years ago this month, eight British drivers have garnered a total of 12 world championships. Hawthorn, Jim Clark, John Surtees, Stewart, Graham Hill, Damon Hill, James Hunt and Nigel Mansell. No country heads that.         
	This time the Brazilians have to settle for second place in the all-time list with eight world championships, the cumulative efforts of three racers  Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet and the late, great Ayrton Senna.         
	There have been other star Brazilians  Rubens Barrichello, who was regarded as Sennas protege and natural successor, Jose Carlos Pace and the enigmatic Cristiano da Matta, who gave up F1, saying it was not competitive enough and that the sport was all about the car and little about the driver.         
	Family dynasties also hold sway in the land of samba. Fittipaldi was joined by his brother, Wilson Fittipaldi junior, and his son, Christian, who has raced F1 and NASCAR while Nelson Piquet junior is also forging a career for himself.                 Felipe Massa   
	It is not difficult to explain away British success. Pioneers and inventors of most motor sports, a national obsession with record-breaking speed on land, water and air, a genius for most things mechanical, quirky, determined characters who nonetheless work fist in glove with military-precision teams who would have Field Marshal Montgomery glowing with pride. All backed up by a first-world economy capable of supporting our expensive sporting enthusiasms.         
	But Brazil? Horribly overstretched third-world economy, grinding poverty throughout much of the country, no tradition in cutting-edge technology, historically thousands of miles away from the mainstream of motor sport and innovation. A land where tomorrows party is much more important than next weeks pay cheque, where time is of less consequence than in most quarters of the globe.         
	But dont be deceived. There are pockets of extreme wealth away from the ghettos, and Sao Paulo  the most populous city in the southern hemisphere at 11 million and counting  is pre-eminent among them. Brazilian politician Heloisa Helena constantly berates her native land as the country of rich banks and poor people.         
	The considerable middle-class and above can opt for an indulgent sporting lifestyle and factor in the huge number of those claiming Italian heritage in Sao Paulo  nearly six million  and everything begins to make more sense.         
	Testosterone everywhere, along with individual brilliance, machismo, racing flair and the urgent need to impress. It has become the undoubted centre of motor racing in Brazil, and the enthusiasm for the sport will be there for all to see at the weekend.         
	Four Paulista  citizens of Sao Paulo  have already won their hometown Grand Prix, which must be a record of sorts. Fittipaldi, Pace, Senna and Massa, who took line honours two years ago.         
	The old Interlagos circuit  driven anti-clockwise and renowned for its undulating terrain which put the emphasis on power  was renamed in Paces honour after he was killed in a light-aircraft accident near the city in 1977.         
	For the privileged few, there has been unlimited space, opportunity and time to indulge. Piquets father was a well-known politician, Sennas a prosperous businessman and landowner, and Fittipaldi was the youngest son of Brazils leading motor sports journalist and commentator.         
	F1 might be supported and raved over by the people, but in Brazil it has never been a sport for the people. They are there to watch and dream, not participate.         
	Unlike in football, there are almost no rags-to-riches stories in Brazilian F1. Only those with comparative riches even get to the start-line.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

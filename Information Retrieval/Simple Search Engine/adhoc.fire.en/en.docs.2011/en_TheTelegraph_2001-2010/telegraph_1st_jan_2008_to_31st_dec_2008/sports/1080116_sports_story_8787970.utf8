 Decision pending on third seamer 
   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
   
	Perth: It wasnt anything as dramatic as a kiss-and-make-up happening, but Anil Kumble and Ricky Ponting certainly reached a gentlemans agreement under the watchful eyes of Ranjan Madugalle.
 
	That was on Monday evening.
 
	Come Wednesday and the agreement will be put to test on the most fiery pitch in the business mdash; at the Waca, when the third 3mobile Test gets under way.
 
	Indeed, the attention will be as much on the express pace of Shaun Tait and Virender Sehwags comeback at the highest level after a year (it feels good) as on the degree of gamesmanship and the nature of appeals.
 
	For a change, then, gestures may take centre stage. The purists could scream, but the past 10 days have been quite extraordinary.
 
	If Australia, desperately seeking a record-rewriting 17th consecutive win, couldnt have got a more helpful venue, the visitors (0-2 down in the four-match series) couldnt have faced more odds in their quest not to sink in the Swan River.
 
	Its a must-win situation for Team India and theres so much to prove. Plenty to repay too as, after the SCG Test, Kumble and Co. have received enormous support from Australians cutting across ethnic roots.
 
	What began as a high profile cricket series has, in just 10 days, grown into much more.
 
	Understandably, then, theres more pressure as well.
 
	For the Indians, though, theres relief that Matthew Hayden wont be playing. The series highest scorer (307 at an average of 76-plus) hasnt recovered from a hamstring injury and his place has gone to rookie Chris Rogers.
 
	The one other change in the Australian XI may, however, cause some disquiet. In a horses for courses policy, Brad Hogg has been dropped and Tait (whose action was questioned by New Zealand only recently) included to make it an all-pace attack.
 
	The Indians too are making two changes: Sehwag for the out of form Yuvraj Singh and, again, in a conditions-driven move, a third medium-pacer for Harbhajan Singh.
 
	Irfan Pathan appeared to have the edge, but The Telegraphs sources pointed out that Kumble preferred somebody (either the uncapped Pankaj Singh or Vikram Rajvir Singh) who would push the Australians on the back foot.
 
	That decision wont be taken till just before the toss.
 
	Whats known, of course, is that the Fremantle Doc is bound to figure in the equation for all new-ball bowlers.
 
	Sourav Ganguly, who skipped Mondays nets, had a full workout on Tuesday and pulled up fine. Thankfully, the fever hasnt returned, but the throat is still very bad, he remarked.
 
	Senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar, by the way, is the only one in the squad to have played a Test at the Waca. That was back in 1991-92 and while we lost, Sachin scripted an outstanding 114, among the finest of his hundreds.
 
	In fact, consultant Gary Kirsten has a double-hundred at the Waca mdash; not in a Test, but a first-class match on South Africas 1997-98 tour.
 
	So, its not that the Team India dressing room is actually short on achievers whose exploits should inspire. But, as Kumble put it, the adjustment has to be in the mind.
 
	Kumble is himself one wicket away from joining the 600-club.

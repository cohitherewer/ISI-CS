The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Conditional AIFF nod to foreign replacement
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Conditional AIFF nod to foreign replacement
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Saturday allowed the clubs to replace one foreign footballer midway through the I-League but said it can only be done if the player gets injured.         
	In the I-League meeting held in the capital last month, the clubs requested the federation to make a provision that will allow them to replace at least one foreign player during the course of the league.         
	Citing past examples, the club officials said that injury to foreign players in the middle of the league created problems for many clubs as they were in no position to get a substitute.         
	Aware of the fact that the new law could be used by the clubs to get rid of non-performing foreigners, the AIFF circular said that all injured foreign players would be examined by a panel of doctors to be appointed by the federation before permitting the clubs to recruit replacements.         
	At the same time, the club will have to honour the contractual agreement with the injured player. However, no player can be replaced beyond the 11th round.         
	The federation has also decided to award prize money to first four teams this time instead of three. While the winners will receive Rs 50 lakh, the runners-up will be richer by Rs 28 lakh. The third-placed team will get Rs 20 lakh and the team which will finish fourth will receive Rs 10 lakh.         
	The daily allowances of the players for away matches have also been increased. While in Mumbai, the teams will receive Rs 2,000 per player, the allowances will be Rs 1,800 in Calcutta and Rs 1,500 in Goa and Ludhiana.

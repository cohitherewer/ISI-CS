The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea keen to prove a point 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chelsea keen to prove a point 
                      
	London: Chelsea left Istanbul wondering how they had managed to lose their Champions League quarter final first leg to Fenerbahce but they should recover from the setback in Tuesdays home return.         
	For all the celebrations of the Turkish sides upset 2-1 victory, the odds remain heavily in favour of the London side, who need only a 1-0 success to advance to a semi-final meeting with either Arsenal or Liverpool.         
	I know what I expect and what we can do. I have confidence in my team, never mind whether we are playing Fenerbahce or Barcelona, manager Avram Grant said.         
	Grant rested half his first-choice side for Saturdays 2-0 win at Manchester City and said the squad factor had been important in enabling the club to challenge on two fronts deep into the season.         
	Nevertheless, the second leg of a Champions League quarter final is not a place for sentiment and the big guns will all be back.         
	Essien played at right back in the first leg but could give way to Paulo Ferreira while Petr Cech could return from injury in place of Carlo Cudicini.         
	It is at the other end where Grants selection will be vital, however, with a likely starting front three of Didier Drogba, Salomon Kalou and Joe Cole with Nicolas Anelka on the bench.         
	Chelsea have lacked the panache of Premier League title rivals Manchester United in recent weeks but they have developed a nuggety ability to get the job done and, combined with a two-year 10-game home unbeaten run in the competition, they will back themselves to get the result they need.         
	Our opponents are quality but they do not scare us, Zico said. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hilditch: No need to overreact to loss 
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Hilditch: No need to overreact to loss   
	Melbourne: There was no need to panic or over-react to Australias shocking tri-series defeat against India, according to chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch. He said the world champions would analyse their mistakes and bounce back. Hilditch said Australia had also lost last years tri-series finals to England but bounced back to clinch an unprecedented hattrick of titles at the World Cup.  
	In retrospect, it (losing to England) was a good thing. It probably got rid of any complacency and we went on to win the World Cup a month or two later, so you cant overreact to any of these things, Hilditch said.                 
	ECB stand  
	London: The ECB has said players who take part in the next edition of a rebel Twenty20 league will not be allowed to play in English cricket. The breakaway ICL held its inaugural tournament late last year and has said it will stage its second event from March 9-April 7.   
	The ECB said its regulations would be amended with immediate effect so that a cricketer who plays in an unauthorised event in the 12 months leading up to April 1 would not qualify for registration.                 
	Dilip plea   
	Mumbai: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar has asked the BCCI to adopt the inter-universities cricket tournament for the Rohinton Baria Trophy to bring back the glory days of the tournament when a number of future Test cricketers graduated from this event.   
	I take this opportunity to appeal to the board to adopt inter-universities cricket which was the platform for Test cricketers like Ajit Wadekar, Sunil Gavaskar, Sanjay Manjrekar and Milind Rege, he said.                 
	BCCI workshop   
	Mumbai: The BCCI has cancelled a two-day workshop in Bangalore for players selected for the first Test against South Africa, BCCI sources said Saturday.   
	The players (who returned from Australia on March 6) needed some rest. Thats the reason the workshop to be held on March 18 and 19 in Bangalore has been cancelled, said the source.                 
	PCB hearing  
	Karachi: Disciplinary proceedings against Shoaib Akhtar and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria began Saturday with charges laid on them for violating the PCB Code of Conduct.   
	PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi said: The committee held its first meeting and we will now wait and see what they recommend. Their recommendations would be discussed at the governing body meeting on March 22, Naghmi said.                 
	Twenty20 meet  
	Calcutta: Peerless Smart Warrior won the Peerless Smart Cricket Twenty20 Championship with a two-wicket win over Peerless Smart Boomer on Saturday. Nabin Damani scored 63 and was adjudged Man of the Match. Arup Banerjee of Smart Boomer was the highest wicket taker.  
	BRIEF SCORES: Peerless Smart Boomer 226/6. Peerless Smart Warrior 229/8. Warrior won by 2 wickets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan as good as out of Asia Cup
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pakistan as good as out of Asia Cup

	Karachi: Kumar Sangakkaras chanceless ninth ODI century got admirable backing from his bowlers as Sri Lanka scored an easy 64-run victory over Pakistan in a crucial Super Four match in the Asia Cup at National Stadium Sunday.         
	Chasing 303, Pakistan never looked like overhauling the target and could only score 238 runs from their 50 overs with Misbah-ul Haq top-scoring with a gallant 70-ball 76.         
	Young Ajantha Mendis was the wrecker-in-chief, breaking the back of the Pakistan batting with quick strikes to return figures of 10-0-47-4.         
	Though they still have a theoretical chance of making the title round, the reality is that Shoaib Maliks men are as good as out of the Asia Cup.         
	Earlier, put into bat, Sri Lanka compiled an imposing 302 for seven, thanks mainly to Sangakkaras 110-ball 112, his second century of the tournament.         
	The loss meant that Pakistan (0) will have to win their remaining two matches with comfortable margins and pray that either India or Sri Lanka (on four points each) lose both their matches to reach the final. Misbah, who recorded his highest one-day score, fought a losing battle.

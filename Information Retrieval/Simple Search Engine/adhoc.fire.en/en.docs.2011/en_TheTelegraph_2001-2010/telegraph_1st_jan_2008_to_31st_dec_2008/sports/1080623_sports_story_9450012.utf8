            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Fourteen players, who took Indian cricket to the summit 25 years ago, assembled in the capital on Sunday to celebrate the moment that instantly turned the game into a religion across the length and breadth of the country.         
	Dressed in white shirts and black trousers, the heroes of Indias 1983 World Cup win were present in front a big gathering that included several captains (both current and former including Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid), Test cricketers, BCCI officials, former presidents and high commissioners of the cricket playing nations.         
	Organised by the BCCI, the cricketers, along with manager P.R. Man Singh, once again relived that day. President Sharad Pawar and sports minister M.S. Gill presented a cheque of Rs 25 lakh to each of the players besides a memento.         
	A coffee table book by Srenik Sett, the only Indian photographer to cover the 1983 World Cup, was also released on the occasion.         
	It was the perfect time for Kapils Devils to unwind and share their dressing room experiences.         
	The captain introduced each member of the team. To him, it was Sunil Gavaskar who taught everyone how to win a match. He felt it wouldnt have been possible to win the World Cup without Sunny.         
	Gavaskar was the greatest cricketer of our time, he was like what Sachin Tendulkar is today, Kapil said. India were considered no hopers those days. The matches we drew under Gavaskar were actually won. At least thats the way I would like to think Kapil told the audience.         
	In the end, when Gavakar was asked to speak, he was a touch emotional. The captain has spoken about everyone... But who is going to speak about the captain! he said. The Little Master went at length to describe how Kapil had changed the team into a champion outfit during the 1983 World Cup.         
	The innings he played against Zimbabwe in the World Cup was simply amazing, Gavaskar said. We were five down for 17, and then Kapil played an innings of 175 that has no match till date. In the lunch break when he came to the dressing room, none of us were there. We were hiding our faces We just kept a glass of juice for him on the table and disappeared. He is certainly the greatest cricketer India has ever produced.         
	The most forceful speech came from Ravi Shastri, who was not in the playing XI in the final.         
	Just consider this Shastri said. As the youngest member of the 1983 team, I can say that this team won everything in a span of just two years. The World Cup, the Asia Cup, the Benson and Hedges World Series and the Rothmans Cup.         
	Earlier in the day, a diamond-studded bat, signed by the players, was unveiled. The bat, adorned with 25-carat diamonds, will be auctioned at Lords on June 25 with the proceeds going equally to all the 15 members of the team.

                                                     Sachin: Probably biggest moment in my career
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar en route to his 91                           
	Brisbane: If captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was a picture of calm even after a terrific tri-series win, senior-most pro (and his idol) Sachin Tendulkar was overjoyed.         
	Im feeling so proud Its probably the biggest moment in my career, Sachin told The Telegraph at the team hotel, the Sofitel.         
	Despite being hampered by a groin problem, Sachin raised the level of his game, as only he can, in the two finals.         
	Thats class I dont think Sachin was as focused in the qualifying matches, but he really turned it on in the finals, lauded former Australia captain Mark Taylor.         
	As for Dhoni, without naming the Sanjay Manjrekars, he slammed the Sachin-baiters: People may call him a sitting elephant or whatever, but hes the best and people should be careful about what they write         
	Later, speaking exclusively, a somewhat exhausted Dhoni said hed learnt two things during the past five weeks as the ODI and Twenty20 captain in Australia.         
	First, Ive learnt sledging More seriously, Ive learnt to handle pressure better         
	Dhoni, though, chose not to compare last Septembers World Twenty20 Championship success (under his captaincy) with the humbling of the limited overs world champions at home.         
	That was a world event with different pressures Obviously, I was very happy then and am very happy now Its all a part of learning, he signed off.         
	Bottomline, of course, is that Dhonis getting excellent marks.         
	Footnote: While India shared the TVS Cup with South Africa (in Bangladesh) in April 2003, the last outright success had been way back in July 2002 when we won the NatWest Trophy under Sourav Ganguly.

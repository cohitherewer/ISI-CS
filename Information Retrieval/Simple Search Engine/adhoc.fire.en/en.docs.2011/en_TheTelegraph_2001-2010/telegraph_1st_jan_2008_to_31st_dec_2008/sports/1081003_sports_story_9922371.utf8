	Durban: After the IPL and Champions Twenty20, the slam-bang cricket is poised to become just bigger with the stage set for a T20 Super Series involving India, Australia and South Africa next year.    
	The first ever such venture by the three national boards will have to clear several hurdles, including finding a window in an already crowded international calendar and negotiating the ICC ruling of maximum seven T20 matches a year, but Cricket South Africa (CSA) Chief Executive Gerald Majola is confident the series will go through.            
	Melbourne: Kolkata Knight Riders disastrous Australia tour continues after Queensland defeated the IPL side by 48-runs in the penultimate match of the six-match Twenty20 series, although all-rounder Andrew Symonds made little impact in the win.    
	With this victory Queensland have taken an unassailable 4-1 lead in the series with just one match to go.          
	Mumbai: The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) has agreed to pay the Cricket Club of India(CCI) Rs. 75 lakh for using the Brabourne Stadium to organise the Platinum Jubilee Test between India and England here from December 19-23.     
	In return the CCI authority, who are in charge of the Brabourne Stadium that last hosted a Test match 35 years ago against England, would allow MCA to open a temporary office at its premises 20 days prior to the Test.              New Delhi: The Indian trio of P. Kashyap, Arvind Bhat and Chetan Anand sailed into the third round of the Bitburger Open badminton tournament at Saarbruecken in Germany Thursday.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Humpy storms   into semis 
                            
	Nalchik: A draw would have sufficed but Grandmaster Koneru Humpy showed no mercy and recorded her second successive win against Shen Yang of China to storm into the semi-finals of the World Womens Chess Championship here.         
	In the second quarter final match, Humpy displayed top form yet again and Yang, once again, proved no match for the vastly superior Indian.         
	In the first game of the quarter finals too, Humpy had comprehensively beaten Yang and her second straight victory over the Chinese will also help the Indian add some valuable Elo points in her present rating.

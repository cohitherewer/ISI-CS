                                        ICC salutes Bradman  Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) hailed Don Bradman as ldquo;a byword for brilliance rdquo; on Wednesday, the centenary of the cricketer rsquo;s birth, says A Staff Reporter. ldquo;No name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of Sir Donald Bradman, rdquo; ICC president David Morgan said in a statement from the organisation rsquo;s headquarters in Dubai. That name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket, rdquo; he said. ldquo;Soccer has Pele and cricket has Bradman. rdquo;  No change  Mumbai: Bangalore may have lost the chance to host the 2008 ATP tennis tournament next month because of security concerns expressed by its promoters, but the first cricket Test between India and Australia is expected to go ahead as scheduled in the garden city in October. ldquo;There rsquo;s no change in the tour itinerary. Bangalore is to host the opening Test from October 9-13 after the Australians start the tour with a four-day warm-up tie against a select India XI at Hyderabad from October 2-5, rdquo; BCCI sources said.  Mushtaq quits  London: Sussex rsquo;s legendary former Pakistan international spinner Mushtaq Ahmed confirmed on Wednesday that he has been forced to retire because of a persistent knee injury. ldquo;I am going to miss playing for the club greatly, rdquo; said the 38-year-old, who last competed for his country in 2003. ldquo;I am honoured to have spent six wonderful years here. rdquo;  Camp likely  Mumbai: The BCCI is not thinking of taking part in any international tournament in September following the postponement of the ICC Champions Trophy but is keen to utilise the break in fine tuning the squad for the tough challenge ahead by holding a preparatory camp. ldquo;No, we are not thinking of taking part in any event. We want to hold a preparatory camp for the players ahead of the important (four-Test) series against Australia. The details will be worked out soon in consultation with the concerned people, rdquo; BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said.  ICL matches  Calcutta: Ahmedabad rsquo;s Sardar Patel Stadium in Navrangpura is all set to host some of the 34 Indian Cricket League matches in its first event of the new season commencing on October 10, says A Staff Reporter.  Irani Trophy  Calcutta: The Irani Trophy tie between Ranji Trophy champions Delhi and the Rest of India has been advanced by a week and would be played between September 24-28 at Vadodara, the BCCI said on Wednesday.   ldquo;The match will feature all the probables for the forthcoming Test series against Australia, rdquo; BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said in a statement. The original dates for the season-opening fixture were October 1-5.

	New Delhi: Former Pakistan skipper Wasim Akram on Tuesday slammed the PCB and Shoaib Akhtar for brokering a deal to suspend the bowlers five-year ban to facilitate his IPL stint.         
	Akram also described the entire episode as a drama saying the incident could make a hit Bollywood comedy.         
	First you ban him and then you suspend it to facilitate something. After that, Nasimsaab (PCB chief Nasim Ashraf) and Shoaib are on TV, a politician mediates to sort out the matter Then Nasimsaab drops his case. I think a good Bollywood director can make a hit comedy film, Akram said.

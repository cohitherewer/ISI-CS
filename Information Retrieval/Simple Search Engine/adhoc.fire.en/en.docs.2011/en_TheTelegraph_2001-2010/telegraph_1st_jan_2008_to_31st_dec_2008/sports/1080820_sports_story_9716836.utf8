The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asifs B sample   tests positive
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Asifs B sample   tests positive
                    Mohammed Asif                      
	Karachi: Mohammed Asif on Tuesday found himself in deep trouble as the dope test of his B sample has also tested positive for a contraband substance, leaving the Pakistan pacer facing the possibility of being banned for two years.         
	I can only confirm the B sample test has come positive but the results of both tests are different which is strange to us, Asifs lawyer Shahid Karim said from Geneva.         
	Karim said that the B test, which was conducted on Monday, had found 5.4 milligrams of nandrolone in Asifs urine sample. Asif had asked for a B sample test after he had tested positive for 6.2 mg of nandrolone during the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL), during which he played for Delhi Daredevils.         
	The 25-year-old pacer is already suspended from all forms of cricket by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the first test turned out to be positive. But Asif said from Geneva that he was also surprised at the different test results and was thinking about appealing to the authorities.         
	They took my urine samples at the same time in the IPL and the tests have shown up different results. That certainly makes my case stronger, Asif said.         
	We will appeal to the IPL drug tribunal and point out the difference in the test results. I am hopeful of being cleared even now, Asif insisted. Asif, however, conceded he had taken some medicines for his elbow injury even before participating in the IPL.         
	I can assure everyone that I never took any banned substance or drugs to enhance my performance. Which is why I am still confident of being cleared in this case. We will fight it to the end, the lanky pacer said.         
	Asif had earlier tested positive for nandrolone in 2006 along with Shoaib Akhtar before the Champions Trophy. He was banned for a year and Akhtar for two, but the bans were overturned on appeal.

	Colombo: India were staring at a possible follow on with their famed batsmen crumbling to spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan whose sensational four-wicket haul put Sri Lanka firmly in the drivers seat after Day IIIs play of the first Test on Friday.         
	Weighed down by Sri Lankas mammoth first innings total of 600 for six, India found themselves in total disarray with a spineless batting display which saw them gasping at a precarious 159 for six when play was called off a little early because of bad light.         
	The visitors still need 242 runs to avoid the ignominy of a follow on and will have to bat out of their skins to save the game at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground where the track has started showing signs of a gradual deterioration.         
	The seasoned V.V.S. Laxman (19) and captain Anil Kumble (1) were at the crease at stumps which saw the hosts tightening the noose around their hapless opponents with Tillakaratne Dilshan (125 not out) becoming the fourth player to hit a century.         
	With Virender Sehwag (25), Gautam Gambhir (39), Rahul Dravid (14), Sachin Tendulkar (27) and Sourav Ganguly (23) having returned to the pavilion, much will depend on the experienced Laxman to pull the team out of the pits. India still trail by 441 runs.         
	The Indians were done in by Muralidharan, who dismissed Gambhir, Sachin, Sourav and Karthik, while mystery bowler Ajantha Mendis produced a gem of a delivery to claim former Team India skipper Rahul Dravid.         
	The 23-year-old Mendis, who created a flutter with his exploits in the Asia Cup, continued to bamboozle the Indian batsmen with his variations.         
	Earlier, the hosts declared their first innings 40 minutes into the second session and the two Indian openers  Sehwag and Gambhir gave a flying start though it was short-lived.         
	While Sehwag made his intentions clear slamming paceman Chaminda Vaas to the cover boundary in the very first over, Gambhir followed it with a flowing drive to the long-off boundary of Nuwan Kulasekara in the next over.         
	Jayawardene chose to set an attacking field to put Indian batsmen under pressure after tiring them out on the field for over two and a half days.           (AGENCIES)

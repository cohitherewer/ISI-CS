                                                                                                                                                                                                     Board chiefs not to discuss series today
                      
	Karachi: The cricket board chiefs of India and Pakistan will come face-to-face at the Asian Cricket Council meeting in Colombo on Friday but PCB chairman Ejaz Butt says the issue of next years series will not be discussed.         
	Butt told reporters before leaving for Colombo that due to the political and diplomatic tensions between the two countries, there would be no discussion on the tour on the sidelines of the meet.         
	Butt and BCCI president Shashank Manohar will attend the ACC development/finance committee meeting.         
	As far as discussions on the India series is concerned the Indians have confirmed a meeting in Chennai on December 12, Butt said.         
	I think even the media knows that in these conditions it would be inappropriate to discuss the tour with Manohar on the sidelines of the ACC meeting.         
	Butt said the matter was now in the hands of the governments but as far as PCB was concerned they were progressing with the preparations for the tour.         
	All we can do at this stage is assure all touring teams including India foolproof security arrangements if they come to Pakistan, he said.         
	Butt though admitted that existing conditions could make things difficult for series to materialise.         
	Indian team can come to Pakistan only if their government gives a clearance. India are scheduled to play three Tests, five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 match during the tour.

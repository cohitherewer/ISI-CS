The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Business interest at play behind return: Report
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Business interest at play behind return: Report

	London: Englands decision to tour India within a fortnight of the Mumbai mayhem was not driven by their urge to stand by a terror-stricken country but by a business deal, according to media reports here.         
	Apparently, it took lot of deliberation and persuasion on the England and Wales Cricket Boards (ECB) part to convince Kevin Pietersen and his men to tour India for the two-Test series.         
	But according to a report in an English daily, the joint effort by the ECB and the Board of Control for Cricket in Indian (BCCI) is actually a marriage of convenience and hinged on mutual benefit.         
	Let us not be fooled by the idea that this cause is entirely noble, the report said.         
	The BCCI, sensing how much cricket means to their people, have moved heaven and earth to make the tour possible. But India also have other assets to protect in the form of the Indian Premier League (IPL), and England need India on their side to make a success of their own so-called England Premier League starting in 2010.         
	There are commercial imperatives at play, it added.         
	By agreeing to tour India, the report claimed, the players were increasing their stake for the next edition of the cash-awash IPL.         
	By going to India now should they ever get there to play two Test matches, Englands players will be doing themselves a favour when new multi-million-dollar IPL contracts are handed out in February, it added.         
	The daily quoted former England captain Tony Gregg as saying that had the BCCI failed to host England for the Test series, many foreign players would have developed cold feet and skipped next years IPL.         
	The Indian authorities are painfully aware of what could happen to their business plan if they dont get England back there now, Gregg was quoted as saying.         
	If England dont go then there is a distinct probability that many of the foreign players wont turn up for the IPL in the spring, and that would have a dramatic effect, he said.         
	The ECBs eagerness to befriend BCCI is understandable, said Gregg, since the England board was facing a potential revolt from its players who are keen to join the IPL.         
	The move by both the boards to move on after the Mumbai terror attacks also drew flak from the report which said, So consigned to history is the Mumbai massacre that those who suggested a period of calm reflection and sober remembrance before whatever passes for normal life resumes have been casually dismissed.         
	It is as if that period has already passed. In corporate speak, especially important in this context, it is time to move on.           (PTI)

                  Stuart Broad and wicketkeeper Matt Prior, who took six catches, celebrate the fall of a South African wicket during the second ODI at Trent Bridge on Tuesday. (AP)                     
	London: Stuart Broad returned a career-best five for 23 to help England thrash South Africa by 10 wickets in the second one-day International at Nottingham on Tuesday.         
	The visitors went 0-2 down in the five-match series after collapsing to 83 all out in 23 overs, their second lowest total in a one-dayer.         
	Wicketkeeper Matt Prior picked up six catches to equal the world record for a one-day International innings held by Australian Adam Gilchrist, Englands Alec Stewart and Mark Boucher of South Africa. The home team then raced to victory in 14.1 overs, Prior hitting 45 not out and Ian Bell an unbeaten 28.         
	Earlier, South Africa won the toss and chose to bat on a good Trent Bridge pitch for batting that also offered some sideways movement for the seam bowlers.         
	Broad snapped up the first four wickets, with Andrew Flintoff (3/29) and Steve Harmison (2/4 in one over) providing excellent support.         
	The procession began when Herschelle Gibbs was caught down the leg side by Prior off Broad.         
	Captain Graeme Smith, who should have been run out without scoring, was then brilliantly caught by Prior as he dived in front of first slip.         
	That gave the 22-year-old Broad his 50th wicket in a one-dayer, making him the second youngest after team mate James Anderson to achieve the feat.         
	South Africa crashed to 26 for three when Jacques Kallis edged a square cut to Owais Shah at first slip off Broad.         
	The England allrounder added a fourth victim in the next over when left-hander JP Duminy edged to Prior.         
	Flintoff trapped AB de Villiers lbw and had Boucher caught behind to reduce the visitors to 50 for six.         
	Broad completed his first five-wicket haul for his country when Johan Botha was caught behind.         
	Harmison came on to bowl with seven wickets down and claimed the wicket of top scorer Andre Nel (13) with his first ball, his attempted slog being caught at mid-wicket.         
	Albie Morkels boundary took South Africa past their previous lowest total of 69 before he offered Prior his sixth catch of the innings.         
	The third match is at the Oval on Friday.           (AGENCIES)

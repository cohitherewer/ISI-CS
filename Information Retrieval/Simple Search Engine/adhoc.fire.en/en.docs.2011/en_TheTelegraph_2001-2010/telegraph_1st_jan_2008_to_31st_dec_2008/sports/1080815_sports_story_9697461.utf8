The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Referrals assessment next week
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Referrals assessment next week
  - Waiting for such a (review) verdict is like three minutes in the ICCU: Sourav Ganguly       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: Just where the umpire review experiment is actually headed should become clear by the end of next week when a sub-committee of the International Cricket Councils cricket committee deliberates via a teleconference.         
	The review (or referral) system was on trial during the India-Sri Lanka Test series which ended on Monday. But for Englands refusal, the England-South Africa series would also have seen the headline-making experiment which allowed each team to challenge decisions a maximum of three times in every innings.         
	According to a spokesman for the world body, the teleconference will either be on August 22 or 23 and will feature cricket committee chairman Clive Lloyd, Sunil Gavaskar, Anil Kumble, Kumar Sangakkara, Tim May, Simon Taufel and Dave Richardson.         
	All the principal stakeholders have a place on the sub-committee.         
	The views of the sub-committee, formed specifically to assess the trial, will then be placed before the cricket committee.         
	Mahela Jayawardene and Co., it may be recalled, gained big  11 of the 27 reviews went their way. The Indians, on the other hand, could manage only one from 21.         
	Clearly, Kumble and his men were beaten on all fronts.         
	Sourav Ganguly, the sole Indian beneficiary, told The Telegraph: Yes, one review went my way (in the second innings of the Galle Test), but waiting for such a verdict is like three minutes in the ICCU! The heart misses so many beats         
	He confirmed that non-striker Dinesh Karthik had prompted him after Billy Doctrove gave him out leg-before to Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	The TV umpire in that Test was Mark Benson.         
	While the Sri Lankans are in favour of the reviews getting permanency, Indias Test captain Kumble certainly has reservations.         
	The other day, he spoke of teething problems with technology and the need to assess aspects of the entire exercise.         
	Indeed, even with the reviews, some of the decisions were baffling, to say the least. The Indians, as it turned out, suffered.         
	Generally, opinion appears pretty divided, though many agree that any mechanism to eliminate the obvious mistakes (at least) needs to be welcomed.         
	Except for a couple of days in Galle (ironically, the Test won by India), hardly anybody kept the turnstiles busy during the series. The on-field umpires, therefore, didnt have to contend with much when they reversed their decisions after a chat with the TV umpire.         
	It wont be the same during crowd-pulling matches, for example, at the Eden Gardens or at the MCG or at the Wanderers.         
	Thats something which, perhaps, has to be kept in mind.         
	No more than three Elite Panel umpires (Rudi Koertzen, Benson, Doctrove) were on duty throughout the three-Test series, either on the field or in front of the TV, and their views on the experiment are likely to be conveyed to the sub-committee by Richardson.         
	A former South Africa wicketkeeper, Richardson is the world bodys general manager (cricket).

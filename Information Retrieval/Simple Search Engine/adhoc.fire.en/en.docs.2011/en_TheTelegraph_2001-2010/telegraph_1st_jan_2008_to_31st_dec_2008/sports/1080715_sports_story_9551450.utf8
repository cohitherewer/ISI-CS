The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IT IS ASIF AGAIN
                                                                                                                                                                                                     IT IS ASIF AGAIN
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                                I have taken no banned substances or drugs and I am innocent. I am hoping the  board will support me and help me clear my name. I will take a decision on  having sample B tested after consulting the board I just dont know how this  has happened because I have been very careful with the medicines I use  Mohammed Asif, after it was confirmed that he tested positive      
	Calcutta/Karachi: Pakistan pacer Mohammed Asif was at the centre of a doping scandal after it was disclosed by Lalit Modi, commissioner of the Indian Premier League (IPL), that he had tested positive during the inaugural edition of the tournament. The bowler can be banned for up to two years from international cricket.  
	According to a statement by the IPL, it has compared the result from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)-approved laboratory in Switzerland with the data collected by IDTM, the Sweden-based independent agency, which organised the dope tests during the IPL. The results have confirmed the presence of a banned substance in Asifs sample. The statement also said that Asif had not applied for Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE).         
	The test was conducted after the May 30 semi-final between Delhi DareDevils and Rajasthan Royals. Asif played for Delhi DareDevils in the tournament.         
	Eight cricketers were tested during the tournament, in accordance with the Wada standards. Asif is the only one to have tested positive.         
	Asif has been dropped from Pakistans shortlist of 35 players for the Champions Trophy in Pakistan in September.         
	The IPL announced on Monday that the Pak istan pacer has been informed of the adverse analytical findings which constituted a violation of Wada codes. He has the right to request that his B sample be analysed. He and his representative, along with an IPL official, will have the right to attend the opening and analysis of the B sample.         
	If that sample also tests positive, it would be referred to the IPL drug tribunal, which consists of former India captain Sunil Gavaskar, ex-vice chancellor of Maharashtra University of Health Sciences Dr Ravi Bapat and lawyer Shirish Gupte.         
	Asif has a history of doping. The speedster and his teammate Shoaib Akhtar tested positive for nandrolone just before the 2006 Champions Trophy held in India, and were sent home before the tournament started. Recently, Asif spent 19 days in detention in Dubai for allegedly carrying a banned substance, but was released without being charged.         
	According to the Wada code, a first-time offence leads to a ban of two years, while a second violation invites a life ban. Apart from Wada sanction, Asif also faces ban from the future editions of the IPL.         
	Asif expressed shock at the findings. I am shocked and surprised because I was extra cautious, the bowler said .         
	The news of Asif testing positive came as an embarrassment for the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), which has been rocked by one controversy after another over the past few months.         
	I can assure you that we will take all possible actions listed in our anti-doping policy and the player will not be shown any leniency, Shafqat Naghmi, chief operating officer of PCB, said.         
	The International Cricket Council (ICC) has put the onus of taking action against the guilty player on the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	The ICC is aware of an adverse analytical finding (AAF) from the recently-concluded Indian Premier League (IPL)... As with any AAF that arises during a testing programme organised by one of the ICCs members, it is the responsibility of that member, in this case the BCCI, to deal with the process in a timely and fair manner, the ICC said.         
	Since Asif was cleared by the PCB in the first instance following an appeal, his first offence has not been recorded, according to an ICC spokesman.         
	The ICC, however, said it will keep a close eye on the way BCCI handles the matter to ensure that the player is punished.         
	Meanwhile, the Wada representative in Pakistan slammed the IPL organisers for prematurely identifying the player who failed a dope test. The BCCI rejected the contention saying it acted within the rules.

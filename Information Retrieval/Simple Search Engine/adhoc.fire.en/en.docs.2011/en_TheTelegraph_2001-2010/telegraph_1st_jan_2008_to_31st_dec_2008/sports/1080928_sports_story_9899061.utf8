The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ill be able to take the pressure: Srikkanth
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ill be able to take the pressure: Srikkanth
    - Looking ahead, one will have to plan for the 2011 world Cup: New chief selector           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Srikkanth                                 
	Mumbai: Nineteen years after he succeeded Dilip Vengsarkar as the India captain, Krishnamachari Srikkanth followed him into the (senior) chief selectors chair.         
	Understandably a little wary of saying too many things on his very first day in office, the Chennai-based Srikkanth nevertheless took some questions from The Telegraph on Saturday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts               
	First reaction         
	Im very happy that the BCCI has so much faith in me and has given me such a big responsibility... Its a job with a high degree of accountability, not only to the BCCI, but the entire country... Whatever I am today is because of cricket and Im ready for the challenges that lie ahead.         
	The pressure element         
	I accept there will be pressure, but its part of the game... Its always there, whether youre a player, coach or selector... Touch wood, Ill be able to take the pressure.         
	Having to sever ties with the media, particularly TV, as the selectors will now be paid         
	I guess so... Im waiting for the guidelines from the BCCI.         
	Whether hell continue as a brand ambassador for the Chennai Super Kings, one of the eight IPL teams         
	Again, I cant say anything till Ive received the guidelines... Ill have to follow whatever is laid down by the BCCI.         
	Priorities as chief selector         
	The first, quite obviously, is to pick a team which can beat Australia in the about-to-begin series... Looking ahead, one will have to plan for the 2011 World Cup... Weve got to have a team which can win that tournament.         
	If he has already spoken to colleagues, two of whom (Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani) played international cricket with him         
	(Laughs) Not yet, give me some time.         
	On the possibility of his committee having to take hard decisions         
	Ill be able to answer this question in due course... Let the committee meet for the first time, at least.         
	The role he sees for seniors in Team India         
	I wouldnt like to say anything off the cuff... So, for now, no comment.         
	Whether the players can expect a fair treatment from his committee         
	Absolutely, everybody will get justice.         
	Finally, thoughts on predecessor Vengsarkar         
	Dilip and his team did an excellent job... Well have to continue the great work done by the last committee.

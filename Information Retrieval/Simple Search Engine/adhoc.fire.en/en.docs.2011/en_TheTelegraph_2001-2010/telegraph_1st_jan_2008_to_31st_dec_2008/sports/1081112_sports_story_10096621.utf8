The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McLaren not to impose will on Force India
                                                                                                                                                                                                     McLaren not to impose will on Force India
                      
	New Delhi: The McLaren management has said that they might suggest preferred drivers for their new partner Force India but made it clear that they would never try to impose their will on the Vijay Mallya-owned Formula One outfit.         
	Force India on Monday announced its new ground-breaking partnership which would see the Silverstone-based outfit running on Mercedes engines and using gearbox and hydraulic systems provided by McLaren.         
	Subsequently, speculation was rife that McLaren might push for the appointment of Paul di Resta and Pedro de la Rosa in place of Giancarlo Fisichella and Adrian Sutil for the next season.         
	Speaking to autosport.com, McLaren F1 CEO Martin Whitmarsh, however, made it clear that everything would be discussed with Force India but it was Mallya who would eventually be calling the shots.         
	Theres nothing off bounds in this partnership, Whitmarsh said, when asked if McLaren would suggest new drivers. The McLaren top official also ruled out the possibility of Force India becoming a McLaren B team.         
	At the end of the day, weve got to be respectful that Force India are a team in their own right. They are a partner, but although there will be a range of strident suggestions and recommendations, this team have to decide. Its in his hands.         
	This isnt a takeover by McLaren. This is an independent team that we happen to be partnering. (PTI)

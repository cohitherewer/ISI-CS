                                  Indian players after winning the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in September, 2007		    
	The following are the salient features of the Twenty20 game:  
	 A team will bat for 20 overs.  
	 A minimum of five overs needs to be played by each team to get it counted as a match.  
	 A match shall be of 3 hours duration with 20 minutes break.  
	 New batsman will get only 90 seconds after the fall of wicket to be in position to take guard OR his partner to be ready to face the ball.  
	 To save time for reaching the ground, the batting team will sit near the boundary instead of pavilion.   
	 A bowler can bowl a maximum   of four overs.  
	 In a reduced overs match, no bowler can bowl more than one-fifth of the 
  total overs.  
	 Only one fast short-pitched delivery allowed per over. Additional such ball bowled in the over will be called no-ball.  
	 A ball that passes above the batsman rsquo;s head (facing the delivery mdash; standing upright) shall be called wide.   
	 A full pitched ball passing or that would have passed above the waist height of the batsman standing upright will be called a no-ball.   
	 The next delivery after a no-ball will 
  be a free hit ball (chance for batsman to hit; the batsman can rsquo;t be bowled out in that delivery. Only way the batsman can be out in free hit delivery is by being run out).   
	 Fielding team can rsquo;t alter the positions of fieldsmen during a free hit delivery.   
	 Umpire will signal the free hit by raising one arm and rotating it in a circular manner.   
	 Only two fieldsmen will stand outside the 30-yard circle in the first six overs. For the remaining overs, not more than five players can stand outside the circle.   
	 Not more than five fieldsmen to stand on the leg side.   
	 Time wasting by fielding side will be penalised by the batting side being awarded 5 penalty runs.  
	In case of a tied match (bowl out)  
	 To decide the winners in drawn matches in semi-finals and final, each team will pick five bowlers who will try to strike the wickets with no batsman present. The team, which will hit the wickets the maximum time, will be declared the winners.

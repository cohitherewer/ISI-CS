The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The team has found its feet, says Smith
                                                                                                                                                                                                     The team has found its feet, says Smith
                      
	Johannesburg: Coach Mickey Arthur said the future looked rosy for South Africa when the squad returned home on Tuesday following the drawn series in India.         
	The visitors lost the third and final Test in Kanpur by eight wickets on Sunday as India hit back to square the series 1-1 but Arthur was full of praise for his men.         
	Im ecstatic over the tour... and ecstatic about this teams future, he said. Weve been building this team for the last two years. We needed an attack that could take 20 wickets and weve certainly got that, and Im very happy with the way the top six batsmen have taken responsibility.         
	Some of the younger guys, the guys who had potential question marks against their names, have really outdone expectations. Despite the loss in Kanpur, we have won 32 of our last 39 international matches, which is an unbelievable ratio.         
	Captain Graeme Smith echoed Arthurs views.         
	This team has found its feet now and to see their success is hugely rewarding, said Smith.When I first became captain I basically inherited a side but now Ive had the chance to build one.         
	Its a huge positive to captain a side with bowlers like weve got but the top six (batsmen) too have been fantastic. Theyve scored 17 centuries in 12 tests.         
	The team is battle-hardened now and our stats in all three forms of the game have been incredible. But its important they keep challenging themselves, added Smith.         
	South Africa will now take a break before starting their tour of England in June.         
	Weve planned properly, our ducks are in a row and Im pretty sure the players will be fresh (for England), said Arthur.           (REUTERS)

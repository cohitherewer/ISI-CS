                                                   8 golds for India 
                      
	Jamshedpur: Indian archers won eight golds and six silver medals in the bamboo bow section of the second South Asian Archery Championship on the opening day of the three-day meet at the JRD Tata Sports Complex here on Friday. Bangladesh and Nepal picked up one silver and four bronze medals respectively. Sri Lanka and Bhutan failed to win a single medal.         
	 The championship rule that no country can win more than two medals in an event restricted India from sweeping all the medals.           (PTI)

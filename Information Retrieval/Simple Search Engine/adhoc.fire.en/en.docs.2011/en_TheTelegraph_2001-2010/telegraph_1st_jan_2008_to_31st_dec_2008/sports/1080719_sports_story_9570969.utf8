The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mutinous mood at Silverstone
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mutinous mood at Silverstone

	The loss of the British Grand Prix to Donington Park is taking a heavy toll at Silverstone, where the board of the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC), owners of the site, is facing a vote of confidence.         
	The loss of the Grand Prix almost certainly means that grandiose plans to redevelop the Northamptonshire circuit will have to be scrapped.         
	A membership that was already split about the merits of pursuing ambitious restructuring plans in order to retain the Grand Prix, is now mutinous, blaming the board for throwing money at a scheme that was always a risk.         
	In a survey on the BRDC forum, members have been invited to respond to four questions about the competence of the BRDC hierarchy including: Do you think that the board should resign over the recent loss of the Grand Prix contract?         
	The cost of hosting Grand Prix at present rates 11million a throw from 2010 makes it impossible for events promoted without state funding to compete with those in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Abu Dhabi, which debuts next year.         
	The group behind the Donington initiative believes a debenture scheme will make the numbers add up. Some in the Formula One community seriously doubt the feasibility of that.         
	Indeed a question was posed at the last sitting of Leicestershire County Council to determine whether Donington were merely being used as a bargaining tool in the endless round of talks between the BRDC and F1 commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone.         
	Donington have yet to submit any plans to the relevant authorities, though they claim this process is underway.         
	Meanwhile in Germany, Red Bull formally announced that Sebastien Vettel will replace David Coulthard after he retires at the end of the season.         
	The German driver, who turned 21 at the last race in Silverstone, is hailed as the new Michael Schumacher by local media seeking a new headline-maker.         
	Vettel is one of five Germans on the Hockenheim grid, alongside Nick Heidfeld (BMW), Adrian Sutil (Force India), Nico Rosberg (Williams) and Timo Glock (Toyota).

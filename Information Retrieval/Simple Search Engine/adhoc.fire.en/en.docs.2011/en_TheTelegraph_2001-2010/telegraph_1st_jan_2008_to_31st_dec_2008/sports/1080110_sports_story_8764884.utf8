                                                   WICB lodges protest

           
	Kingston: West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) president Julian Hunte joined the furore engulfing the game by lodging a protest over the sacking of Jamaican umpire Steve Bucknor. 
    
	Hunte expressed his displeasure in a letter to International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ray Mali. 
    
	He intimated that the ICC had shown double standards by dumping Bucknor after refusing to take action when the West Indies complained of poor umpiring on their 2005-06 tour of Australia. 
    
	The ICCs reaction by Dave Richardson (the ICCs cricket manager) was to acknowledge that errors were made but to insist that the overall standard of umpiring has improved in recent years, particularly with the advent of the Elite Panel, Hunte said. 
    
	It would be interesting to know what made this situation any different. 
    
	Meanwhile, in a press release issued on Wednesday, ICC president Ray Mali has affirmed the independence of the world governing bodys appointments and Code of Conduct processes. 
    
	He also explained the decision to remove Steve Bucknor as the umpire for the third Test between Australia and India in Perth on the grounds that it was a practical solution has helped to avoid a possible diplomatic fracas.

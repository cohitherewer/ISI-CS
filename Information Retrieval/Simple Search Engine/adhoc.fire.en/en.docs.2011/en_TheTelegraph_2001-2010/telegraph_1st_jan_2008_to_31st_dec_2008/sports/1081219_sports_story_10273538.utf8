                                                                                                                                                                                                     Player quota
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	It was one small step that could yet turn out to be a giant leap for the English game. Football League chairmen voted Thursday to bring in what is thought to be the only quota system on foreign players anywhere in Europe.         
	Fans will barely notice any changes to their teams when the new rule that four of the 16 players in a matchday squad should be home grown is introduced. All but two clubs out of 72, it is estimated, already comply. On the face of it, the home-grown rule seems to be little more than a cosmetic exercise.

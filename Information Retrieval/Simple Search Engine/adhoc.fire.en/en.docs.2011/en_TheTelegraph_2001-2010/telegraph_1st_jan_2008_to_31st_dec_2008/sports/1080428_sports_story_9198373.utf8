The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Engineer promises a fair trial
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Engineer promises a fair trial
                      
	Mohali: Farokh Engineer, adjudicating the slap-row involving Harbhajan Singh and Sreesanth, on Sunday said the ace off-spinner would be given a fair trial.         
	I can assure you that Harbhajan will be given a fair trial. Lets see what he has to say, the former wicketkeeper told reporters here.         
	Engineer will conduct the disciplinary hearing, as per the ICC Code of Conduct, in New Delhi on Monday.         
	The Match Referee, though, was concerned with the ramifications of the shocking incident. The IPL has taken cricket to a different level. We certainly do not wish to tarnish our image by anything on or off the field, he said.         
	Engineer, who had earlier said he was not going to sweep matters under the carpet, said he would not be evasive while adjudicating over the matter.         
	It is not in my nature to be negative or evasive about anything but I will not disclose anything about tomorrows hearing which is only fair until all parties are heard, he said. (PTI)

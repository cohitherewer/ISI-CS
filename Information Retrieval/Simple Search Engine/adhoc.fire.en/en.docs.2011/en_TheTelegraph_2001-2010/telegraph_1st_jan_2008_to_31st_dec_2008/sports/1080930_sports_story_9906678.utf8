	San Luis Potosi (Mexico): Indian junior team finished fourth in the Junior Davis Cup competition after losing 1-2 to Russia in the World Finals.         
	Saurabh Singh continued to struggle to find his form as he was once again outplayed in the match between second-ranked players.         
	Richard Muzaev beat Saurabh 6-1, 6-0 to put his team ahead but then Yuki Bhambri once again brought India back into contention winning his singles match.         
	Yuki beat Mikhail Biryukov 6-0, 6-4 to draw parity.         
	However, the Indian combine of Yuki and Saurabh then squandered the one-set lead in the decisive doubles rubber to lose 6-4, 5-7, 3-6 to the Russian pair of Richard and Mikhail.         
	Both, second-seeded India and top-seed Russia, had lost their semi-final ties.         
	India had lost 0-3 to US on Sunday. Yuki had fought hard before going down to Denis Kudla 4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6.         
	Saurabhs poor form had contributed to Indias semi-final loss. (PTI)

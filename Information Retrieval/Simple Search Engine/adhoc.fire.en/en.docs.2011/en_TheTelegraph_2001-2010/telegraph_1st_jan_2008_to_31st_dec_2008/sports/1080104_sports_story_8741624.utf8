                                                   Prince, Boucher lead fightback

           
	Cape Town: An unbeaten half-century by Ashwell Prince led South Africa to 218 for five at close on the second day of the second Test against the West Indies on Thursday. 
    
	Prince was batting on 55, having shared an unbroken partnership of 87 for the sixth wicket with Mark Boucher (35). Earlier, West Indies were bowled out for 243 in their first innings. South African openers Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie, playing his first Test since 2004, put on 46 before McKenzie (23) edged pacer Jerome Taylor to Chris Gayle at first slip. 
    
	Taylor struck again after lunch when Smith was caught behind by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin for 28. Jacques Kallis and Hashim Amla then shared a stand of 59 before Dwayne Bravo removed both in consecutive overs.

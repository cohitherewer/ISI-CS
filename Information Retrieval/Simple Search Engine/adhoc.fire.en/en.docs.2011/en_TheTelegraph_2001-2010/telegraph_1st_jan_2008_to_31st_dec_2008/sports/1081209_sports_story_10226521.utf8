The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Four black players a must: CSA
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Four black players a must: CSA
                      
	Durban: Cricket South Africa (CSA) has reiterated that there should be a minimum of four black players in the national team and a minimum of seven in a squad of 15.         
	CEO Gerald Majola issued a statement to this effect following reports in Australia that CSA had done away with its affirmative action policy in redressing the imbalances in cricket representation.         
	The reports in the Australia media surfaced on the eve of South Africas tour to that country in a few days time.         
	The targets set by CSA for this coming season for the Proteas are a minimum of four black players on the field and a minimum of seven black players in a squad of 15, said Majola.         
	It must be stressed that these are targets, and if they are not met, CSA attempts to rectify the capacity building programmes to ensure that the process is making progress.         
	Once the imbalances have been satisfactorily rectified, then CSA would consider whether or not to withdraw targeted transformation.         
	Nobody at this stage can forecast when this will take place, as the massive disparities in facilities alone still remain a legacy of the past, said Majola.         
	CSA has a Transformation Review committee which undertakes in-depth interrogations of the transformation system and makes recommendations to CSA on the success or otherwise of the implementation of this policy.

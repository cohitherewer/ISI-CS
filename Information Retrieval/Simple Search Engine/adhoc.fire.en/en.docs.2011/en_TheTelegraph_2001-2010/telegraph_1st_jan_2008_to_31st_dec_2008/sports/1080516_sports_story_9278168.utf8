The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Season set to start from Saturday

	Bangalore: The 26-day Bangalore summer season is finally set to start from Saturday. The season was postponed owning to paucity of rain. Races during the season would be held mostly on Saturdays and Sundays except in the last two weeks. The season concludes on August 8.           
	Mysore races, too, will start from May 21 and the 16-day season will end on July 23.          
	About 740 horses are expected to participate during the season, as against 775 last year. The horse-strength here has suffered because of restrictions imposed on horses coming from Mumbai  owing to the outbreak of strangles in Western India. Strangles is a killer disease which is, however, learnt to be under control now. Yet, about 126 outstation horses  mainly from the other southern centres  will be seen in action during the season.          
	The rating system is going to be restructured following recommendations made recently at the international racing conference held in Paris. The minimum weight of jockeys has been raised from the present 47kg to 50kg. Consequently, the 00-30 category would be shrunk to 00-25, and the upward brackets would be 20-45; 40-65; 60-85 while the 80 amp; above will remain the same.          
	As a result of this, the weights in handicap races will now be from 50 to 62.5kg (difference of 12.5kg) and not 47kg and 62kg (difference of 15kg) as was the practice earlier. The statutory penalty for winning a race after publication of weights will now be 5kg instead of 7kg. Scales of jockeys and apprentices claiming allowances have also been revised. They can claim a maximum of 4kg, and not 5kg.

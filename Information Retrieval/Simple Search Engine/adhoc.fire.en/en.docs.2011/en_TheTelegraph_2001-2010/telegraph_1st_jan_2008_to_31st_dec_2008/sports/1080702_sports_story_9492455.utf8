The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IWF orders fresh trials
                                                                                                                                                                                                     IWF orders fresh trials
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF), which recently selected dope-tainted lifter Shailaja Kumari for representing the country in the Beijing Olympics, has now ordered for fresh trials to be held in Pune on July 15.         
	According to IWF sources, new trials have been ordered after it was alleged that some of the senior weightlifting officials helped Shailaja to get selected ahead of Monika Devi, whose performance during the Asian championships played a big role behind getting India the lone berth in the Olympics.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, a senior IWF official said: Quite a few norms were flouted during the trials in Pune to get Shailaja selected.         
	First of all, there was only one international referee, Ratnakar, who was present during the trials while the rule clearly states that there should be three referees of international stature.         
	The official also said that only two jury members were present during the trials.         
	A section of the IWF officials have also raised questions about Shailajas marked improvement in performance during the trials.         
	Shailaja lifted 218 kg during the Asian championships. In the trials she did more than 240 kg. It was definitely a magical improvement, the official said. The fresh trials would only harm the lifters. They cannot now reach their peak in the same way as they did in the last trials.         
	Some IWF officials have even alleged that a senior member of the federation accepted bribe on the eve of the trials.

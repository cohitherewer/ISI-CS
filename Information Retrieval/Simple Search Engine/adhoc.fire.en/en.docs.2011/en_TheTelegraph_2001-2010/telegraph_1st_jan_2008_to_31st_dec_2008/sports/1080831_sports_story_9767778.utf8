                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pay hike likely for duo
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Mahindra United may increase the salaries of N.P. Pradeep and Steven Dias to keep the two players in their fold this season.         
	According to sources in the Mumbai club, the Mahindra management is in no mood to release the duo in favour of East Bengal but may pay more to get the best out of the two India stars in the forthcoming I-League.         
	A Mahindra official, when asked whether the club would have a meeting with East Bengal regarding the two players, said: I dont know what meeting you are talking about. If East Bengal has anything to say then they can come and talk with my club management.         
	He, however, pointed out that the final decision rests with the Mahindra management.         
	Their other colleagues from the national team may be getting more money from their respective clubs, the Mahindra official admitted.         
	Perhaps they were offered a similar amount by East Bengal. The Mahindra management is aware of this and if need be, will look into this aspect.

                                                      Baghdatis crashes out, Nadal advances

	Chennai: During a fourth-round match against Roger Federer in 2005 Australian Open, Marcos Baghdatis, then an upstart from Cyprus, was being supported in Australia by a Greek chorus so loud that the world No.1 later said that he had to check the score and make sure that he was actually winning. The Cypriots sang along as if Baghdatis was walking away with the match!
 
	The crowd here too did their best, cheering at the top of their voice but it wasnt enough as the world No.16 was sent crashing out of the Chennai Open in straight sets on Tuesday by Robin Haase. 
 
	Never mind that the world No.114 needed six match points to win 6-3, 6-4. Baghdatis failed to convert any of his seven break points too. 
 
	But if one crowd favourite bit the dust, the other didnt. Rafael Nadal looked razor sharp during his 6-2, 6-4 demolition of Mathieu Montcourt. 
 
	The Spaniard dropped just one serve and needed 22 winners to polish of the French challenge. Montcourt didnt actually throw in the towel, but little can one do if ball after ball comes back with more force and accuracy than with which it is being hit. 
 
	Third-seeded Carlos Moya also reached the second round with a facile 6-4, 6-1 win over Russian Teimuraz Gabashvili in an hour and five minutes. The veteran Spaniard slammed five aces and converted six of his 12 break points.
 
	If one is tempted to call the Baghdatis result a shock, more so since he came into the tournament as the No.2 seed, it wasnt one actually. 
 
	Baghdatis had always found Haase a tricky customer to handle. In the ATP Masters Series in Canada last year, the Dutchman had stretched the Cypriot to three sets. In Chennai, however, Haase belied his ranking of world No.114 and played near flawless tennis. The 20-year-old had nothing to lose and it showed. The more accurately he played, the more erratic Baghdatis became.
 
	The Cypriot is a mountebank whose ebullience rubs on to the crowd so much that they will him on, no matter where he plays. But on Tuesday Baghdatis appeared subdued and refused to attack even in those rare moments when he had Haase on the ropes. 
 
	The second game of set No.1 would later set the tone of the match as Baghdatis, who enjoyed a 48-22 (win-loss) record in 2007, made two errors from 40-30 to hand Haase the lone and decisive break. 
 
	Both players would then hold on to their serves but as the game went on, Haase seemed to be enjoying it more than his counterpart. His big top-spinning forehand was working well and he peppered the baseline and caught Baghdatis on the run. 
 
	The second seed would stitch a few shots together to set up a nice volley in the open court only to hit it wide or into the net. The first set was over in 32 minutes and it looked as if Haase would win in a canter. Win he did but not before the Cypriot showed a stomach for fight in the second set.
 
	Down an early break into the second it seemed Haase would wrap it up even quicker but in the sixth game, Baghdatis threw the kitchen sink at Haase. Three break points later, Haase held. The world No.16 would have one last crack at breaking the Dutchman in the final game of the second set, but he obviously needed more than four break points. 
 
	Haase will meet Croatian qualifier Lovra who hit 15 aces to breeze past Thierry Ascione of France 6-4, 6-0.
 
	Day II also saw the demise of No. 8 seed Marc Gicquel of France who lost 6-7 (5-7), 4-6 to Kristof Vliegen of Belgium. 
 
	American qualifier Rajeev Ram moved into the pre-quarters with a 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-2) win over Yuri Schukin of Russia.

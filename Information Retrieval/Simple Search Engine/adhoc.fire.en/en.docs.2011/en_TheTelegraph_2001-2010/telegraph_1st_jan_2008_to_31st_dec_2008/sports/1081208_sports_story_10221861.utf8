The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diego for current rules
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Diego for current rules
            JAYDEEP BASU            Maradona in the city on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Diego Armando Maradona is human after all.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Maradona, who ruled the world of football till the day he hung up his boots in 1997, admitted he is the God of football, but pointed out that even God is not spared the suffering.         
	Maradonas pain and regret for not having spent enough time with his daughters is well-documented, but what continues to hurt the messiah of football, perhaps even more, is how many have conspired against him and how they have left him drained. Maradona said he wished that Fifa had introduced the rule banning tackles from behind during his playing days.         
	The current rule is very important. In my time the rules were more lenient. In the current scenario, that (Claudio) Gentile from Italy would not have played the game at all. It was simply horrible. All he wanted was to hit me.         
	In present day football, I would have definitely played more freely. I could have given more passes to my colleagues. But I dont know whether I would have scored more goals, said Maradona.         
	In the 1982 World Cup, Maradona was at the receiving end of several tackles from the Italian defender, who hit him continuously in the match and later said football was not meant for ballerinas.         
	During his Barcelona days, Maradonas enemy number one was a certain Andoni Goikoetxea, famously known as the Butcher of Bilbao         
	Maradona has not forgotten anything. The man with the divine left foot jumped off his chair the moment the Spanish defender was mentioned to him.         
	He wasnt a defender. He was there only to hit me from all angles. Can you believe the fact that he was not even shown a yellow cardI could not believe my eyes.         
	Asked whether he was a left sympathiser, Maradona laughed loudly: Yes man, I am. But then, I was born to be a leftist.         
	He then suddenly got up from his chair and rolled up his trousers to show the Che Guevara tattoo on his left leg. I adore this man greatly So, I have got his face tattooed on my leg.         
	Maradona said that given a similar situation, he might score another hand of God goal. Who does not want to score to win an important match, he said.         
	And then, did they know that I scored with my hand till I told them? There was no definite proof. Everyone around was highly confused. Even my teammates were confused. I was urging them to come and hug me. Otherwise the referee would have to cancel it.         
	He said he was not happy with the standard of the English Premier League. It has certainly improved in the last few years, he said. The matches in the EPL are mostly played in great speed but there is lack of precision. Matches without precision can prove to be boring at times, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DareDevils have the advantage
                                                                                                                                                                                                       DareDevils have the advantage
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag                           
	New Delhi: Five days after routing the Chennai Super Kings at the Chepauk, Virender Sehwags Delhi DareDevils are hoping for an encore when the two teams meet in the return match of the IPL at the Kotla Thursday.         
	With Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir back to familiar surroundings, the DareDevils certainly hold an edge despite the unpredictable nature of the Twenty20 format. While the hosts have so far lost only one match in the tournament, the Super Kings have succumbed to defeats in their last three outings.         
	Missing Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey and Jacob Oram in their last three outings, the Chennai team is yet to find replacements for the terrific trio. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni hasnt scored too many runs so far. The Chennai side would also expect young Suresh Raina and New Zealander Stephen Fleming to steer the team out of the woods.         
	Delhi DareDevils will depend on their top-order batsmen to deliver the goods on Thursday. Sehwag made it clear that he wanted his first three batsmen to do the bulk of the scoring.         
	In Twenty20, whenever the top-order fires the team has the chance to win, Sehwag said. Fortunately my team has been doing well in the batting department. Our top-order has done well in four out of six matches so far and I am expecting one of the top three fires in the remaining matches.         
	Sehwag also felt that the heat would be a stumbling block for a 4pm start. The bowlers will find it tough to bowl.         
	He is very much aware that the Super Kings will go all out at the Kotla to make a comeback. Super Kings have struggled with their combination, he said. They were making more than 200 in the initial matches but could not maintain that form.         
	They are struggling but then no team is weak in this IPL. Any player can turn a match single-handedly because it is a short game, Sehwag said.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik on Wednesday described Shoaib Akhtar as a great bowler but said he wasnt sure how the Rawalpindi Express would actually perform.         
	Asked whether the fast bowler would be able to turn it around for the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Delhi DareDevils player said he didnt know how Akhtar was shaping up.         
	I am in India for the last three months. So I dont know But I am sure he is training hard. After all, he is a great bowler, Malik said.

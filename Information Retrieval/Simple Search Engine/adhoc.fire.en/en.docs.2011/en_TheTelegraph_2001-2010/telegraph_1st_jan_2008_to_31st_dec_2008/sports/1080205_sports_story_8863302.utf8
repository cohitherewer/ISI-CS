	New Delhi: Two former English football stars launched the Premier Leagues innovative coaching programme Premier Skills here on Monday. 
    
	The duo  Warren Barton, formerly of Newcastle United and Robbie Earle (Jamaica and Wimbledon) spent an hour with kids during the programme. 
    
	The project is run here by the English Premier League, British Council, All India Football Federation and ESPN-STAR Sports.

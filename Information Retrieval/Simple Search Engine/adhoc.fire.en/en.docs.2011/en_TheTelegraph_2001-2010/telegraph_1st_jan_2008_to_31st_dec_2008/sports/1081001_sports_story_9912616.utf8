                                                                                                                                                                                           Rozario rues missed chances
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Stanley Rozario blamed his teams inability to score, despite creating several chances, for their defeat against Mumbai FC in their I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday.         
	The boys gave their best chances were created, but we failed to score, Rozario said when asked to identify the reason for the defeat.         
	Rozario, assistant to national coach Bob Houghton, also claimed that his side should have been given a penalty in the second half for a foul on Yusif Yakubu.         
	We dominated the match At one point of time all Mumbai FC players were defending, he said in the post-match news conference.         
	He refused to accept that David Booth, the Mumbai-based sides British coach, had a tactical upper hand.         
	Booth gave credit to his defenders for the win and said he was surprised to see both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan lose playing the same type of football.         
	It was a simple strategy to defend our goal. Our defenders played well and we reinforced our defence as East Bengal went all out for a goal, Booth said.         
	It was surprising to see both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan play long balls down the centre. Goals come from crosses from the two wings, not the centre.         
	The British coach also dismissed suggestions that there would be extra pressure on his side after defeating East Bengal and Mohun Bagan in their two opening matches.         
	We will try to continue the good work. Zero points is pressure but six points from two matches is no pressure, he quipped.

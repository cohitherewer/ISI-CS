  - FIRST TWO TESTS vs SA
  -   Gautam Gambhir May make XV         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      (From top) Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma                                   
	Calcutta: Key players Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma have been asked to undergo a fitness test at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore on Monday morning.         
	That exercise will be completed some hours before the senior national selectors meet, in Bangalore itself, to pick XV for the first two Tests against South Africa.         
	Its a three-match series.         
	We want to be absolutely sure of their fitness, which is why theyve been called to Bangalore, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar told The Telegraph on Saturday evening.         
	Yuvraj (the ODI and Twenty20 vice-captain), Harbhajan and Ishant did the full tour of Australia which ended earlier this month.         
	Of the three, Yuvraj is carrying an injury  damage to his left knee  which occurred as far back as two months ago, in the build-up to the Perth Test. The same knee had been badly hurt in October 2006.         
	Harbhajan has been having a left hamstring problem, while Ishant injured his right middle-finger during the first tri-series final, at the SCG.         
	While Zaheer Khan hasnt recovered from his injury, theres no word on the fitness of another medium-pacer  Pankaj Singh. Hes not turning out for his zone, Central, and so its being assumed that he has a major injury.         
	I dont have details of what has happened to Pankaj, Vengsarkar said.         
	Pankaj, whose roots are in UP (Sultanpur district), but who plays for Rajasthan, had been a member of the Test squad in Australia.         
	Meanwhile, its learnt that Gautam Gambhir, who wasnt in the Test squad in Australia, could make the XV. Hed been in fantastic form in the tri-series there.         
	The first two Tests are in Chennai (from March 26) and Ahmedabad (April 3 onwards), respectively, while the third is in Kanpur (from April 11).

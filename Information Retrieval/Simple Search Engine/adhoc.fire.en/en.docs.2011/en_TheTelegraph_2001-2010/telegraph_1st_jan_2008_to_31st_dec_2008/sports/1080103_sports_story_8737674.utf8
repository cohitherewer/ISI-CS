                                                Ive been lucky... Ive got some bad decisions too: Symonds
  - Australias centurion admits Steve Bucknor erred in not giving him out on 30       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Andrew Symonds in action at the SCG on Wednesday. (Reuters)		    
	Sydney: The explosive Andrew Symonds ended 2006 with a brilliant hundred in the Boxing Day Test against England. Well, he has begun 2008 with an authoritative unbeaten three-figure knock versus India.         
	Symonds, who played his first Test almost six years after his ODI debut, spoke to the media at the SCG on Wednesday evening. He also had a brief one-on-one with The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On his commanding innings of an unbeaten 137, batting at No.6         
	Really, I havent had much time to reflect on it... Innings such as mine probably dont mean much till the end of the game... Of course, theres a feeling of satisfaction that Ive helped take the team close to 400... If we can have a good result in this Test, then I can look back and say that I contributed to our win.         
	On having almost sprinted from 50-100 (50 minutes, 51 balls)         
	At that stage in my innings Id become more comfortable... Felt confident to use my feet and hit the ball in the air a bit... It took me quite a while to get adjusted to the surface as it was a bit two-paced... Took me time to really feel comfortable.         
	On not having been given out (by Steve Bucknor) despite being caught behind off Ishant Sharma on 30         
	Ive been very lucky... Thats cricket... Ive got some bad decisions too, but wont talk about them...         
	On whether his escape could have a big impact on the outcome of the second Test         
	(Grins) Possibly... I dont care... Its happened and theres nothing you can do about it.         
	On whether technology should be used in a bigger way         
	I dont think the game needs to go to the point of every decision getting referred... Weve got a good product and a great sport and lets not push (technology) too far... People make mistakes... Umpires make mistakes every day... Its a question of how you handle it and how you go on after the mistakes...         
	[Brad Hogg chipped in to say youve got to keep the human element in there...]         
	On whether the Indians lacked intensity as the first day wore on         
	Well... I dont think so... Brad and I batted quite sensibly and worked the momentum back in our favour... I thought the Indians bowled well, but didnt have the luck they could have had.         
	On Australia being so close to 400 (376 for seven)         
	Its a very healthy first innings score... I suppose it puts us in a position of winning... Hopefully, we wont be able to lose from here... On the SCG, its a very handy score.         
	On whether hed been following the scoreboard         
	Its only in the last 30-40 minutes that I realised wed come so far... The partnerships, first with Brad and then with Brett Lee, have gone a long way in taking us to where we are.         
	On having thwarted Anil Kumble         
	I try and keep it simple... Just watching the ball and not trying to get too aggressive too early... I get a feel of what hes bowling and then counter-attack.         
	On whether Australias recovery from 134 for six highlights the difference in the mental make-up of the teams         
	Australian teams pride themselves on fighting back... Showing mental toughness and heart... This team is no different and takes up challenges.         
	On having grown out of the image of a one-day specialist         
	Feels nice... Indeed, feels great to wear the Baggy Green... It means a lot to any Australian cricketer.         
	Finally, on whether his unbeaten hundred at the SCG is a fitting reply to those whod abused/taunted him in Vadodara and Mumbai during the recent ODI series in India         
	(Grins) No... No... Im not seeing it that way... Those incidents are a thing of the past.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Referrals a fallout of Sydney Test
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Referrals a fallout of Sydney Test
                      
	Colombo: The most controversial Test in recent times, featuring India and Australia in Sydney, is what encouraged the International Cricket Council to think of introducing the referral system.         
	The way we look at it, is, whats better or whats worst for the game. The umpires making mistakes and being accused of cheating, teams threatening to leave the country and flying home and boards criticising the umpires or a system where the umpire is given an opportunity to review his own decision and make a final decision himself? Dave Richardson, ICC general manager of cricket, asked.         
	On Steve Bucknors removal from the Perth Test in January, Richardson said: There were calls for Steve to be fired permanently and we have resisted that. Hes a good umpire and hes had a long career. The reason for taking him out was because of the hype which made it impossible for him to stand in that Test. He was on a hiding to nothing. The slightest error would have been blown out of proportion. To make it easier on him and his colleagues in that Test, we decided to rest him and so diffuse the situation.         
	Dispelling fears about the umpire referral system, the ICC on Wednesday said the new technology is just an extension of appealing and the on-field match official would continue to have the final say.         
	Defending the referral system Richardson assured it would not affect umpires status. The umpires word is still final but this is an extension of appealing, Richardson told reporters here.         
	Richardson said the new technology will put to rest any allegations of biased officiating as the players will now be able to refer on-field decisions to the third umpire.         
	There will be 22 cameras for monitoring at the Sinhalese Sports Club here to assist in facilitating the decision-making process and for the first time virtual eye system will be used for reviewing leg before decisions.         
	Under the new system, each side will be allowed three challenges in each innings and the number of challenges remains intact if a decision is reversed using the system.         
	While technology is utilised to make decisions like run outs and stumpings, the new system will allow seeking reviews on all types of decisions.         
	Indian skipper Anil Kumble also supported the introduction of the new appeals system. We have already accepted third umpire decisions on run outs and stumpings, its just moving forward, Kumble said.         
	Kumbles counterpart Mahela Jayawardene also threw his weight behind the system.         
	What we are trying to eradicate is obvious mistakes that happen on the field. I think the umpires are in favour of that as well. Its going to be used for the first time so I am not sure how good it will be but we need to support this because it will benefit cricket overall.

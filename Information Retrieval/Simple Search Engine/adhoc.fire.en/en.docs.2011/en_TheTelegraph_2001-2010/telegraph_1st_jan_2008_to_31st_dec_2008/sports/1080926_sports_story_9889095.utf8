                                                                                                                                                                                           JCT object to Marcos claim
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: JCT on Thursday took objection to Marcos Pereiras claim that the Phagwara club was wrongly preventing his move to Mohun Bagan. The Brazilian footballer wrote to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Wednesday, urging the parent body to intervene in this matter. He also claimed that he had not signed any contract with the JCT for the new season.         
	A JCT official said, they have already replied to the federation letter. We have not made any accusation against Marcos but have only stated the facts, the official told The Telegraph.         
	JCTs letter to the AIFF stated that without a letter of recommendation from the Punjab club, the Brazilian player would have not received his visa for the season.         
	We have also submitted documentary proofs with the letter, the JCT official said. We had no intention to make all these things public but had to do it after the AIFF insisted for a reply.

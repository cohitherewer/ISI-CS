	London: Russia took advantage of an ailing Novak Djokovic to reach the quarter finals of the Davis Cup, advancing to the next round along with Germany and Sweden.         
	The Russians, who lost to the US in last years final, earned their decisive point in the 3-2 win over Serbia when Djokovic withdrew from the first reverse singles match despite leading Nikolay Davydenko 6-4, 6-3, 4-6.         
	I decided to stop because I dont want to risk my health, the Australian Open champion said. I wanted to fight. I tried to play but in the end I was aware of the fact that I am very dizzy and I have a lack of energy. I just didnt want to continue because of the risk I had.         
	Sweden rallied to beat Israel 3-2, winning both reverse singles matches on Sunday and Philipp Kohlschreiber gave Germany the winning point in a 3-2 win over South Korea in the best-of-five series by beating Lee Hyung-taik 6-0, 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (1).         
	The United States, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Spain and France all reached the quarter finals on Saturday.         
	Djokovic, however, played the doubles on Saturday, partnering with Nenad Zimonjic to give Serbia their first point. Djokovic saved 15 of 19 break points and caused Davydenko to make 27 forced errors.         
	Djokovic in the first two sets played clean, very clean, just no mistakes, Davydenko said.         
	After winning the first two sets, Djokovic went up 3-0 in the third.         
	After 3-love, I started to fight and winning a few points and coming back and winning a set, said Davydenko, who eventually pulled back to 4-4. I was surprised.         
	In the final match, Davis Cup rookie Viktor Troicki beat Dmitry Tursunov 7-6 (7), 6-4, 6-3.         
	Russia will play the Czech Republic in the quarter finals in April.         
	The Czechs lost both reverse singles matches but still beat Belgium 3-2. The Swedes, who reached the semi-finals last year, will play Argentina in the quarter finals.         
	The Germans played without Tommy Haas, who has a shoulder injury. Germany next gets Spain, which led 3-0 at Peru ahead of Sundays reverse singles. (AP)

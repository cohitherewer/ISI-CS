	Stewart Cink did not make much of an impression on Tiger Woods over the morning instalment of their 36-hole final in the Accenture Matchplay Championship.         
	He was five down to the world No. 1 after 11 holes  and still four down at the 18th in a match in which his putting seemed to have deserted him.         
	Take what happened at the 18th. Woods, having been bunkered twice, was 20 foot short of the pin in three. Thereupon Cink, who was on the greens apron in two, left his first putt seven feet below the hole, and ended up walking from the green with a three-putt bogey to halve the hole.         
	Cink, who has four PGA Tour victories to Woods 62, had talked after his semi-finals of an approach to matchplay which is diametrically opposed to Woodss. He plays the course rather than the man.         
	The best thing I can do, he said of the final, is to go out there and play golf like its strokeplay. Thats what Ive been doing all week.         
	Some people play the man, but I dont buy into that at all. Ive played five matches to get this far and I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times that Ive changed my strategy based on where my opponent is.         
	Woodss views on matchplay are all about playing the person. In match play, he noted, what your opponent does is dictate what you do and vice versa. You can force your opponent to try things that he doesnt really want to do.         
	What Woods loves about the format is the fact that the feeling you get in the last round of a strokeplay tournament is there on the first tee of every match you play. You just have to step up to the plate and hit shots; you cant afford to slip up.         
	In the Woods versus Henrik Stenson semi-final, the Swede had holed a long putt at the 16th to draw level before Woods made an answering 12-footer to regain his lead at the 17th. Afterwards, when Woods talked about having felt in control throughout the match, someone felt constrained to ask, But did you still feel control standing on the 17th tee?         
	Yeah, returned Woods, before reminding his audience that he had been in that position many times before and that he had played umpteen more matches than Stenson.         
	Having been up at 3.45am for Saturdays quarter and semi-final rounds, Woods at times had to struggle to retain the right degree of momentum on Sunday. Youve got to be at that energy level at all times, he said. You cant let it slip and you cant let it get too high. I know where I need to be at, and its just a matter of being there.         
	Woods also shed a bit of light on his ability to hole the putts that matter. It has to do with filed memories of big putts holed in junior days  and to trusting his reconnaissance work. I get mad at myself, he said, when I waiver on what Ive seen and change my read when I get over the ball.         
	Asked whether he believed he could win every tournament he enters, the 13-time major champion replied: Thats my intent. Thats why you play. If you dont believe you can win an event, dont show up.         
	Stenson, who was setting out to play Justin Leonard for third place, had already had no mean week for one who was defending his title. Looking back to his semi-final, he was happy to have taken Woods to the home green but disappointed that he had not managed to build on that putt at 16.         
	Its all that any of us can do... keep on trying and eventually well get him, he said.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rai gets away scot-free
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rai gets away scot-free
  - Shailaja pleads innocence       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF), it seems, is on a mission to reinstate doped tainted lifters.         
	After selecting controversial lifter Shailaja Pujari for the Beijing Olympics, the IWF has now decided to let off Satisha Rai without any punishment for his second dope offence.         
	Both Shailaja and Satisha Rai have a history of taking drugs and were banned twice. While Shailaja was banned in 2000 and 2003, Satisha Rai tested positive in 2002 Commonwealth Games and 2007 National Games in Guwahati.         
	Under the latest IWF dope policy, any lifter who tests positive for the second time for stimulants or steroids at international or domestic competitions should be banned for life.         
	In this case, the IWF has let off Satisha on the ground that the lifter has already retired and has contributed a lot to the sport.         
	While the IWF sources said that the lifter has been let off by the president of the federation, Harbhajan Singh, who used his powers, a senior IWF official said that the president has no such authority to pardon a dope tainted lifter.         
	This is a clear case of violation of rules, he said. The three-member committee, which took the decision, was certainly under pressure from a section of the top brass, the official alleged.         
	PTI adds: Pujari Wednesday broke her silence by dismissing charges of corruption and claiming that she was the right candidate for the Games. She also said selecting any other weightlifter in her place for the competition would be the violation of the rules.         
	Shailaja has been alleged to have paid a bribe of Rs 5 lakh to the IWF secretary B. R. Gulati for her selection ahead of Monika Devi. The alleged bribe scandal prompted the sports ministry to inquire into the incident and direct the IWF to send Monika for the Games.         
	Shailaja said she was shocked to learn that sports ministry had recommended Monika (69kg), who was far behind her in the trials.         
	In a letter to Andhra Pradesh general secretary L Venkatram Reddy, she wrote that since the quota was earned by the Indian team, the final selection had to be done through trials in which she proved herself as the best.         
	I am the rightful candidate to be sent to the Olympics 2008 and sending any other weightlifter shall be a blatant mistake and against the laid rules of the IWF, Shailaja said.         
	I also appeal to you to conduct selection trials in your presence at any place at any given time so that I prove my better ability and be rightful candidate for the entry to the Olympic Games. I beg your intervention in this regard and justice to me and the sport, she said.

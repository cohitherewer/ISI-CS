	Wellington: Tim Ambrose and Paul Collingwood rescued England after New Zealands Jacob Oram had triggered a top-order collapse to ensure the second Test was evenly poised at the end of the first days play on Thursday.         
	Ambrose and Collingwood came together with their side tottering at 136 for five during the middle session to combine for an unbeaten 155-run sixth wicket partnership. The duo guided England to 291 for five at stumps on Day I.         
	Oram had produced a tight spell that consisted of nine overs, four maidens, six runs and two wickets after the lunch break and Kyle Mills, Mark Gillespie and Chris Martin grabbed a wicket each to seize control in the post lunch session.         
	Ambrose (97 batting) and Collingwood (48 batting), however, fought back after tea. The wicketkeeper, playing his second Test, notched up his second half-century and highest Test score so far. He pushed to complete his maiden Test century in the final over of the day, slashing at three deliveries from Oram only just to miss each and frustrate the New Zealand slip cordon. Collingwood was more circumspect but still managed six boundaries and was two runs short of his ninth Test half-century.         
	England had begun the day well with captain Michael Vaughan (32) and Alastair Cook (44) putting on 79 runs and batting through until the lunch break after Daniel Vettori put them in on a green-tinged Basin Reserve wicket.

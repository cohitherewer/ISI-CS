                                                                                                                                                                                           CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Asif, Yousuf in Pakistan ODI squad  
	Karachi: Pakistan selectors have named senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf and pacer Mohammed Asif in their 16-man squad for a triangular one-day International series in Bangladesh from June 8. We have picked the best possible squad for what would be a tough tournament, chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said. Meanwhile, Jeff Crowe has been named match referee for the tri-series. Asoka de Silva will be one of the on-field umpires.  
	THE SQUAD         
	Shoaib Malik (captain), Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf, Misbah-ul Haq, Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal, Mohammed Asif, Umar Gul, Sohail Tanvir, Rao Iftkhar, Wahab Riaz, Nomanullah, Fawad Alam, Bazid Khan.         
	Smith return         
	Calcutta: South Africa captain Graeme Smith is targeting the three-day tour match against Middlesex for his comeback from hamstring injury ahead of the Test series against England, according to A Staff Reporter. I dont think it would be a good idea to rush him back for the tour opener against Somerset and the second warm-up match against Middlesex looks the better option, coach Mickey Arthur said.         
	Shoaib test         
	Karachi: Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar will have to undergo dope tests before the Asia Cup only if his appeal against the five year ban on him is upheld by the appellate tribunal, says a PCB official. The dope tests will only be conducted on those players who are qualified or selected to play for Pakistan, the senior official said. Meanwhile, well-known lawyer and information secretary of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party in Punjab Naved Chaudhry has been appointed on the appellate tribunal.         
	Younis deal         
	Sydney: Pakistan Test batsman Younis Khan has signed with South Australia as their marquee player for part of the 2008-09 Australian cricket season, the South Australian Cricket Association said Monday. Under the terms of his contract Younis will play with South Australia until Christmas and then return for the finals if required.         
	Pak coach         
	Karachi: The PCB has trashed reports of replacing national coach Geoff Lawson with former captain Wasim Akram. Yes, we have made an open coaching offer to Wasim to be the bowling coach but this does not mean Lawson is being fired. This is rubbish, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said.         
	Kalighat best         
	Calcutta: Kalighat emerged champions in the A.N. Ghosh Trophy after thrashing Sporting Union by an innings and 362 runs on the fourth and final day at the Eden on Monday, says A Staff Reporter.         
	BRIEF SCORES: Sporting Union 187 and 99 (Sourasish Lahiri 3/16, Avik Chowdhury 3/15). Kalighat 648. Kalighat won by an innings and 362 runs.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sreevats Goswamis month long stint with the Bangalore Royal Challengers in the just concluded Indian Premier League (IPL) has been a memorable experience.         
	The 19-year old, who bagged the City U-19 Player of the tournament award, reached the city on Monday night. It was a great experience for me. The past month has been a memorable one, he said.         
	The India Under-19 World Cup winning wicketkeeper feels that it has helped him mature as a cricketer.         
	I can feel it... Yes my viewpoint has changed. I am a much-matured cricketer now. You can easily notice the difference in my batting. I just want to carry forward this maturity, Sreevats said.         
	His close friendship with South African Mark Boucher has helped him develop his wicketkeeping skills and overall game. We are now good friends. He supported me all through the tournament and told me how to cope with the pressure. His tips about feet movement during keeping and also during batting has also been of great help, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali likely vs Assam
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Murali likely vs Assam
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CAB on Monday announced a 14-member squad for the first two Ranji Trophy (Plate, Group B) matches against Assam and Madhya Pradesh. The squad includes seven players from Kalighat.         
	 The big boost could come on Tuesday with the likely confirmation that Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan will be available for the away tie against Assam, starting from November 3.         
	Arindam Das and Debabrata Das didnt make the squad while young Rohan Banerjees good performance in the recently concluded SK Acharya Trophy got rewarded. Anustup Majumder is likely to be his opening partner.         
	Arindams exclusion, however, raised a few eyebrows prompting a senior member of the side to say that the opener was dropped for non-cricketing reasons.         
	The team includes two wicketkeepers, but chief selector Sambaran Banerjee confirmed that Wriddhiman Saha will slip on the keeping gloves, while Sreevats Goswami will feature as a batsman.         
	The team will of course be lead by Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who will surprisingly have no one as his deputy.               
	The Squad         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla (captain), Rohan Banerjee, Anustup Majumder, Sreevats Goswami, Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha, Sohom Ghosh, Iresh Saxena, Sourasish Lahiri, Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul, Ashok Dinda, Avik Chowdhury, Ritam Kundu.

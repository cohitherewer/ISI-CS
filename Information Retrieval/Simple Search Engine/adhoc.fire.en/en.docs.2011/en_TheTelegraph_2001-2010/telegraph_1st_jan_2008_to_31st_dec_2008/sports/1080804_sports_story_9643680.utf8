The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji relieved to put past behind him
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bhajji relieved to put past behind him
                              
	Galle: Back to doing what he does best, star India spinner Harbhajan Singh said on Sunday that he is relieved to have put behind recent controversies and deliver the goods for the team in the second Test against Sri Lanka.         
	The off-spinner, who bowled India to a series-equalling 170-run win against Sri Lanka with a 10-wicket haul, said he was happy to prove his worth as a match-winner.         
	Its satisfying to come out of the controversy. I am happy and now I want to keep playing and take more and more wickets for the country, Harbhajan said.         
	The volatile offie was embroiled in the Sydney racism row and before the dust settled on that issue, Harbhajan figured in the slap-gate episode, which saw him missing part of the Indian Premier League and sitting out five ODIs.         
	Dwelling on his performance in the Test, Harbhajan said patience paid off.         
	I was more patient here than the previous Test in Colombo. Despite, hard work, no plan worked in our favour there. I also tried to do something different here, an elated Harbhajan said.         
	I decided to bowl a little bit faster to use the breeze blowing across the ground. It helped me to drift the ball, he said.         
	Apart from Harbhajan, pacer Ishant Sharma also played a crucial role .         
	Happy with his show, the lanky Delhi pacer said: The wicket was uneven, so I didnt try anything different. I thought if I bowl at the right areas, I will get assistance from the pitch, Ishant said.         
	With the new ball, if you can get the early breakthroughs, it gives you a lot of confidence and also boosts the morale of the team, he added. (PTI)

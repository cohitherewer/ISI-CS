The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena claims Bangalore title
                                                     Serena claims Bangalore title
                  Serena Williams after winning the title on Sunday                     
	Bangalore: Former world No. 1 Serena Williams flexed her muscles on the big points to shut out Swiss world No. 12 Patty Schnyder in the final of the Bangalore Open on Sunday.         
	The American world No. 11 was inconsistent for the most part but drew from her wealth of experience to edge out fourth seed Schnyder 7-5, 6-3 in 83 minutes for her first title of the season.         
	I dont think I was at my best. Patty played real good. She forced me to bring my game out, Venus told a news conference.         
	I focused on not making many errors. I went for enough, she added.         
	Third seed Serena, who beat older sister and world No. 7 Venus in the semi-finals on Saturday, was stretched by left-handed Schnyder, who subtly varied her angles to tire her opponent.         
	But the American, playing her first tournament since the Australian Open quarter final in January, was up to the task and to every trick thrown at her by her opponent.         
	Serena, who skipped tournaments in February to recover from dental surgery, broke her opponent in the sixth game of the opening set, but lost her serve immediately and admonished herself.         
	The first set was tied at 5-5 when Serena, 26, went up a gear. (The) first set could have gone either way, Schnyder said. She (Serena) served herself out of trouble, the Swiss added.         
	Serena, one of the hardest hitters of the ball on the circuit, fired seven aces compared to her opponents one.         
	The American, who ended on the wrong side of the result in both of their meetings last year, broke Schnyder in the 12th to win the opening set.         
	I was happy to take Serena to 5-5, she showed great focus, Schnyder said.         
	Schnyder went up 3-1 in the second set against an inconsistent Serena, but the multiple Grand Slam winner came back strongly, winning the next five games to wrap up the match.         
	She made it tough for me to play my game and the rallies I like, Schnyder said. Three-one up in the second, somehow my energy level went to Switzerland maybe. That shouldnt have happened.

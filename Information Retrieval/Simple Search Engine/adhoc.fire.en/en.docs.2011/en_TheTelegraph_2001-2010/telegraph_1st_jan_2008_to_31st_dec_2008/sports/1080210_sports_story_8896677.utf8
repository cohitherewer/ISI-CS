                                                   Peta to BAI: Use nylon shuttlecocks
                      
	Mumbai: Animal welfare organisation, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), Tuesday suggested the Badminton Association of India (BAI) to replace shuttlecocks made of bird feathers with the nylon ones.         
	After learning that bird flu fear was causing shortage of shuttlecocks made from goose and chicken feathers, we have requested BAI to use nylon shuttlecocks, Peta general secretary L.C. Gupta said.         
	The organisation also sent two boxes of highest quality nylon shuttlecocks to BAI which are more durable than those made with feathers. Just as birds should not be killed for sport, badminton need not die out because of bird flu, Peta chief functionary Anuradha Sawhney said.         
	The national camp for the Thomas and Uber Cup qualifiers this month, scheduled in Goa from February 7, was called off due to unavailability of shuttlecocks. BAI also called off another camp meant for the juniors, scheduled to take place in Chandigarh in preparation for the Dutch and German Open beginning February 27, and for the Youth Commonwealth Games later this year.

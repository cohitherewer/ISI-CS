                                                   Common sense must prevail: Steve
            SHARP SINGLE                
	 Former Australia captain Steve Waugh feels Matthew Hayden should have been more careful in saying what he did against Harbhajan Singh during a radio interview.         
	Hayden last week said the Indian off-spinner was an obnoxious weed and it created a furore which led to Hayden being reprimanded by the CA. Waugh, in his column for The Daily Telegraph, said: Whether Matthew was caught off guard or was sending out a message that the friendly stuff was no longer a priority is debatable, but what is certain is that it was never going to go unnoticed by the authorities.         
	Common sense must prevail, with players respecting each other and keeping the personal stuff on the field and the authorities becoming more consistent in their attitudes.

	Guwahati: Cometh the moment. Cometh the champion.         
	Three-time world champion M.C. Mary Kom on Thursday staged a solid comeback to the ring after more than two years layoff, beating her Kazakh opponent Boranbayeva Nazgul to book a pinweight (46 kg) semi-final berth in the ongoing 4th ASBC Asian Womens Boxing Championship at the Karmabir Nabin Chandra Bordoloi Indoor Stadium here.         
	Taking the ring on a somewhat subdued note from the blue corner, the home favourite from Manipur posted a 8-2 victory over the Kazakh.         
	Trailing by two points she conceded in the first round, Mary Kom staged a spectacular comeback in the second round, swiftly clinching three quick points.         
	However, the Kazakh rose to her feet again in the third round to resist further onslaught by the Indian.         
	It was a memorable victory for me. I never expected to stage such a comeback with just two months of practice after nearly two years of layoff, Mary Kom said after the bout. She will now meet Nguyen Thi Hoa of Vietnam in the semi-finals Saturday. Hoa beat Pin Meng Chieh of Chinese Taipei 12-2.         
	The other Indian boxer to shine was Pavitra, who booked the second semi-final berth, coming back from behind to beat Ri Chung Son of DPR Korea 7-5 in the bantamweight (54 kg) event.

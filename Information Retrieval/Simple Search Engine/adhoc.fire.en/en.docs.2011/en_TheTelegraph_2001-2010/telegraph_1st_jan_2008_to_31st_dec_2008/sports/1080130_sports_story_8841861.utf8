	I had expected East Bengal and Mohun Bagan to mount a serious challenge for the crown before the I-League got under way. I thought both teams would be determined to put an end to Goa and Mumbais domination of the countrys premier club competition. They did need reinforcements in one or two departments but otherwise both had the resources to aim for glory. 
    
	Reality hasnt matched those expectations. With five rounds to go, we have East Bengal struggling to avoid relegation and Mohun Bagan battling to finish in the top-four. 
    
	East Bengals plight has surprised and shocked me. Never in my very long association with Calcutta football have I seen the club hitting such depths. 
    
	This was least expected after they won the Federation Cup. A couple of things went wrong and led to East Bengals slide. Subrata Bhattacharya, in his effort to encourage and inspire local players, managed to antagonise his outstation personnel. 
    
	I think the situation worsened after the first few games of the I-League. It was an important phase for East Bengal, as they were playing away from home. 
    
	Once the rot set in, Subrata just couldnt arrest it. There was a stretch in which they lost seven of eight games. That really hurt East Bengal and has pushed them into the position they are in at the moment. 
    
	The other factor that worked against them was injuries to vital players like Suresh and Edmilson. The Calcutta clubs play so much football in the first four-five months of the season that injuries and exhaustion set in by the time the national league starts. 
    
	This is one problem Mohun Bagan and East Bengal have to address. They have to keep their players physically fit and mentally fresh for the biggest tournament. The AIFF is trying to bring in some strict regulations from next season that should help the Calcutta clubs. 
    
	I dont envy East Bengals new coach. Mona has taken over at a time when the club he represented with distinction for so many years and coached as well, is facing its biggest crisis. 
    
	He will not receive much kudos if he guides East Bengal out of the woods, but none will spare him if the team does get demoted. 
    
	A coach doesnt have much to do with the players at this stage but to inspire them and physically take them to a peak. If they keep running, they can win some matches. 
    
	As they did against Dempo the other night. The three points against leaders Dempo was a huge boost for the beleaguered team. 
    
	Their next three games will also be at home and thats where Monas boys will have to focus hard. They should target maximum points from these games. 
    
	They have to believe that if they can beat Dempo, why not Air India, Mahindra and Churchill Brothers? If they manage to win all three, the pressure will be much less in the last two games. 
    
	The need of the hour is for the fans and former players to extend full support and co-operation. The task is difficult but certainly not impossible.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harmison is all for IPL
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Harmison is all for IPL
                      
	London: Pacer Steve Harmison has stepped up the pressure on the England cricket board to allow players to sign for the Indian Premier League (IPL) saying Indians have benefited from the Twenty20 event which was apparent in their domination of his side in the one-day series so far.         
	Harmison said faced with a choice between playing in the IPL or for the country, England players would choose national colours but added that playing in the Twenty20 event would only benefit them.         
	Even though we havent signed our central contracts yet because we have no idea how long players may be available for the IPL, if it came to a straight choice between playing for England and playing in the IPL, I cannot believe any of our guys would turn their back on their country.         
	Yet watching how the Indian players have gone about their skills in the current one-day series it is clear to me that playing in the IPL has helped them improve in vital areas and had a huge benefit on their team, Harmison was quoted as saying by an English daily.         
	On the other hand, the already strained relationship between England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the players could be further affected with the ECB deciding to keep them away from the planning of its ambitious IPL-style Twenty20 League.         
	The EPL is tentatively scheduled for a 2010 start and is the brainchild of ECB chairman Giles Clark, who is at loggerheads with the players for failing to strike a deal for them with the Indian Premier League.

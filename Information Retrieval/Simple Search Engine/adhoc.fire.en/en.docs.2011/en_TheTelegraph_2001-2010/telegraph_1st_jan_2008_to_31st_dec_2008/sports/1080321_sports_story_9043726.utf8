                                                   Devang unveils new plan
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Devang Gandhis academy is offering underprivileged children a chance to become the next Sourav Ganguly.         
	The Ultra Plus-Balak Sangha School of Cricket, where Devang is the chief coach, on Thursday unveiled its grand plan to bring 80-odd poor children under the academys training programme.         
	Well nurture and train them absolutely free of cost.         
	The academys coaches will conduct mass trials involving about 2500 children between 11 and 13 years and eventually 70-80 will be picked for training, Devang told a news conference on Thursday.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is also involved in the project, with 15 children from each ward expected to join trials.         
	The selection process will begin on March 31 and will be completed by the third week of April.         
	The RPG Group, Ambuja Realty, Bengal Shriram, Peerless General Finance Investment, Accord Capital Market and Ultra Plus Steel are sponsoring the project.         
	Devang also has plans to bring Sourav for an interaction with the kids.         
	Sourav has promised me to come over to the academy and interact with the kids once they are selected.         
	I will also request Sachin Tendulkar to come here.         
	We dont need any foreigner to nurture our talent, the former India opener said.

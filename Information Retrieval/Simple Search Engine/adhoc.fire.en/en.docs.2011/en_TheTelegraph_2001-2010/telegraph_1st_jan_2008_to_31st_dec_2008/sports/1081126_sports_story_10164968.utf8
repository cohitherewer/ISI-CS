            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: East Bengal will be without some of their key players when they take on Dempo Sports Club in the 10th round match of the I-League in Margao on Wednesday.         
	The red and gold brigade, who lost to JCT in their previous encounter in Ludhiana, are literally struggling with their defence as many of the regulars like Surkumar Singh, Suley Musah, Khelemba Singh and M. Suresh are out with injuries.         
	So desperate is the situation in the East Bengal camp that coach Stanley Rozario has planned to field midfielder Mehrajuddin Wadoo in the stopper back position. Another midfielder, Syed Rahim Nabi will also act as a wing-back on Wednesday.         
	Rozario, who earlier said that he would like to end the first leg with at least 18 points, stressed on Tuesday that his young players were capable of carving out a victory against the Goa outfit.         
	The next two matches will be very crucial, said Rozario. Unfortunately we lost against JCT but my players are now determined to make a comeback in the league, he added.         
	The East Bengal coach conceded that Dempo were the best team in the country but refused to call them unbeatable. Dempo have lost to Mohun Bagan and JCT. Then why cant we beat them, he asked.         
	The task of gaining three points against Dempo wont be easy as the Goa team is slowly getting back into the groove after suffering some surprise defeats in the early stages of the league.         
	I am confident of a victory, said Dempo coach Armando Colaco. Ranty (Martins) is among the goals and the midfield is playing well. I am sure my boys will do well against East Bengal.         
	Dempo have 14 points from nine matches while East Bengal have 12.

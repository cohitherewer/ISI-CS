                                                   Target is next World Cup, says Arjuna

           
	New Delhi: Wearing a neat suit and with his grey hair smartly combed back, Arjuna Ranatunga looks the part at a media promotion by Sri Lankan officials to draw Indian religious tourists to the island. 
    
	The firebrand ex-cricket captain, who led Sri Lanka to an upset World Cup win in 1996, takes the microphone to help publicise sites in his small nation steeped in Hindu mythology. 
    
	He is happy to switch to his favourite topic, however, as he reveals his plans for Sri Lankan cricket. 
    
	Ranatunga, 44, took over as Sri Lanka Cricket chairman this month on a three-year term and wants a second World Cup win, this time as an administrator, when the premier one-day event returns to the sub-continent in 2011. 
    
	Although Sri Lanka reached the final of last years edition in the West Indies, Ranatunga feels junior cricket is in urgent need of revamping. 
    
	My target is, how we can concentrate on the next World Cup, how we can win it, he said. We want former cricketers to get involved and try and give ideas on that. We want them to get into umpiring, as curators, everything relevant to cricket. 
    
	He has already roped in Aravinda De Silva, Sri Lankas finest batsman who scored a hundred in the 1996 final against Australia, as a batting expert for the under-19 squad. 
    
	De Silva was with him as a tourism ambassador for Sri Lanka on the trip to New Delhi. 
    
	Sri Lanka are searching for fresh talent to replace players such as opening batsman Maravan Atapattu, who retired last year, and the explosive Sanath Jayasuriya who has already quit Tests. 
    
	Ranatunga served as junior tourism minister and a television commentator after his retirement from the game in 2000 and wants to make a swift impact in his new role. 
    
	In his 18-year career he played 93 Tests, scoring 5,105 runs with four hundreds, and 269 one-dayers, aggregating 7,456 runs.

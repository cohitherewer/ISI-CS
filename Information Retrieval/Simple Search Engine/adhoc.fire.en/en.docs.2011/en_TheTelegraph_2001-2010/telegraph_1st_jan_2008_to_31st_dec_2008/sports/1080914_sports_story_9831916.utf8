The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne inspires McGain
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Warne inspires McGain
                      
	Melbourne: Australia spinner Bryce McGain on Saturday revealed that it was a recent bowling session with legendary spinner Shane Warne that helped him prepare for the four-Test series in India starting next month.         
	36-year-old McGain, who was included in the 15-member squad that tour India, will lead the Australian spin attack along with Tasmanian off-spinner Jason Krejza.         
	McGain said the recent bowling stint at the MCG indoor nets, a month ago, helped him gain some invaluable inputs.         
	McGain said he tried out the tips given by Warne during the just-completed Australia A tour of India and claimed three early Indian wickets before rain ruined the two-match series.         
	Ive followed Shanes career closely, as I have with all spinners in different conditions because thats basically how Ive learnt to bowl.         
	He went to India three times, so he passed on some of his experiences, he said. (PTI)

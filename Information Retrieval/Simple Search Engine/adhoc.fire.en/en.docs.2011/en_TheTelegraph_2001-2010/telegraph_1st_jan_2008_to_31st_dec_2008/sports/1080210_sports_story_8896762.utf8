The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ go up 2-0
                                                     NZ go up 2-0
                  Ryder                     
	Hamilton: Jesse Ryder, criticised only days ago as too fat to play professional sport, hit an immaculate maiden half century as New Zealand beat England by 10 wickets on Tuesday in the second one-dayer.         
	Former New Zealand wicketkeeper Adam Parore was among those who questioned Ryders call-up two weeks ago to the Black Cap Twenty20 and one-day squads, saying the Wellington opener lacked the physique to play at the top level.         
	But in only his second ODI, Ryder smashed an unbeaten 79 as New Zealand took a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.         
	New Zealand first bowled England out for 158 in 35.1 overs in a match reduced by rain from 50 to 36 overs per side. Ryder, 23, and Brendon McCullum (80) then shared a record opening partnership for New Zealand against England as the hosts reached their winning target of 165, revised under the Duckworth-Lewis system, in 18.1 overs.

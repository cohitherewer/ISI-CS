The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hayden: IPL has healed wounds
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hayden: IPL has healed wounds
                      
	Hyderabad: Australias home series against India last summer may have been marred by bad blood and acrimony but towering opener Matthew Hayden believes the Indian Premier League (IPL) has healed those wounds and the animosity would not recur again.         
	Indias tour of Australia threatened to tear the cricket world apart following the racism row involving Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds.         
	Hayden, on his part, contributed to the tumult when he described Harbhajan as an obnoxious weed.         
	Then came the IPL, which had players from various countries sharing the dressing room, and Hayden believes that normalised relations between individuals.         
	IPL definitely came as a big help. It increased the players understanding of each others culture. I enjoyed playing for Chennai Super Kings alongside someone like (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni.         
	It was a fantastic opportunity for me, Hayden said here Tuesday.         
	Asked how he planned to tackle the Indian spinners, especially Harbhajan, on the spin-friendly tracks, Hayden said: As opener, my primary job is to help the side see through the first 30-40 overs, before the spinners come in the picture. But I enjoy the challenge of spin, more so when its on Indian soil.         
	Hayden said the forthcoming series would pose a new challenge for him.         
	As opener, I take on the new ball and it gives me an opportunity to shape the innings. In this series also, I have the important job of shaping the innings, and a good start is always the key, he said.         
	Talking about the current team, Hayden said he did miss Symonds but was sure of the burly all-rounders comeback.         
	Of course we miss him, he is a great mate. But I know he is going to come back stronger, said Hayden.           (PTI)

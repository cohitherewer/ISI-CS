The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting determined to erase the India blot
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ponting determined to erase the India blot
    - Well make life difficult for sachin, says Australian captain                             
	Hyderabad: Ricky Ponting does not gloss over the fact that he has been a veritable dud with the bat on Indian soil, but the Australian believes he can break the jinx this time and erase the lone blot from an otherwise impeccable career.         
	Ponting averages a pathetic 12.28 in India, a jinxed land for the Aussie captain, where runs simply stop flowing from his otherwise prolific blade.         
	You are spot on, Ponting said here on Tuesday, when reminded of his dismal record on Indian soil. This is not the place where I enjoyed a lot of success. There is a bit of a void in my international career. Last time, I missed three Test matches with a broken finger and played only one.         
	Things, however, might change in the forthcoming Test series against India, feels the Australian skipper. Hopefully I would score a lot of runs this time around. Im working hard and hoping to make a turnaround.Ponting said.         
	In absence of Adam Gilchrist, Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne and Andrew Symonds, the visitors sport a rather inexperienced look, but Ponting is not worried.         
	We have to play the game at a certain level and anywhere near our best is good enough to beat any side. India will be competitive, but we have to give ourselves the best chance. Of course our young players are not experienced but their confidence and skill should be good enough, Ponting said.         
	The last time these two sides squared off, sparks flew Down Under and the series was marred by acrimony. Ponting, however, does not foresee a recurrence and said both sides would have to play the game in the right spirit. We will discuss these issues in the Match Referees meeting. Its important for both captains to ensure that the players play in the right spirit, he said.         
	The Australian skipper added that he is game for yet another captains agreement to take the fielders word on contentious catches during the Test series and will take up the matter with Anil Kumble. I would love to talk to Anil regarding this issue at the Match Referees meeting, he said.         
	During their tour Down Under earlier this year, India had a pre-series pact with Australia on close catches under which both the teams agreed to go by the fielders word in such situations. However, during the infamous Sydney Test furore, Indians were left fuming at Australian vice-captain Michael Clarkes claim for what appeared to be a dropped catch of Sourav Ganguly.         
	Talking about Sachin Tendulkar, who is likely to replace Brian Lara as the highest scorer in Test cricket during the Test series, Ponting said his team would make the maestros life difficult.         
	Ponting had no doubt whatsoever that it was just a matter of time before Tendulkar overtakes Lara. Those 77 runs, however, would not be easy to come by, vowed Ponting. Hopefully not (in this series), Ponting said I dont have too many great memories of him, for he tends to score heavily against us, he added.

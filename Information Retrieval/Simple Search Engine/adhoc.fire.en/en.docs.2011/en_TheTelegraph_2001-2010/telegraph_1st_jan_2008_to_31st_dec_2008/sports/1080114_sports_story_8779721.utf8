	For mens tennis in India, the twilight is fading fast. Two impressive Grand Slam titles in 2006  Bhupathi in the mixed in Australia and Paes in the mens doubles at the US Open, has slimmed down to just the mixed doubles runners-up in 2007. Time marches on and 2008 will be Paes 20th year on the circuit. Iconic in stature, Paes battles on and one wonders if he can pull out another title from his hat in 2008. 
    
	For sheer commitment to the country and to the game, Paes stands alone in Indian tennis history. Eight consecutive appearances in the ATP double masters are the hallmark of his genius. 
    
	Bhupathi, laid low by back surgery, will in my view find it difficult to clamber back to Grand Slam titles, specially with his several successful promotional activities. 
    
	At the ground level, the drought continues. Indias best Davis Cuppers, Prakash Amritraj (279), Rohan Bopanna (267) and Karan Rastogi (359) continue to languish in the doldrums beyond the 250-mark rankings. 
    
	The rest have yet to make a significant impression even at the lowest level of international competition, the Futures tournaments. 
    
	In the recent ATP event in Chennai, all 17 Indian participants failed to reach the third and final round of the qualifying rounds. 
    
	Two Indians, Prakash Amritraj and national grass court champion Vishnu Vardhan were pushed into the main draw with wild cards. Both lost in the first round. 
    
	Prakash, nursing a wrist injury, lost a close match to Kudryavtsev, a qualifier ranged 255, but Vishnu Vardhan seemed totally out of his depth. 
    
	The Grass Court Nationals, once the crowning glory of Indian circuit, reduced to penury with a paltry Rs 35,000-prize money for the singles winner and no ATP points, attracted most of our younger aspirants because it offered a wild card entry to the Chennai Open. 
    
	The Nationals was a good opportunity to see our young talent. Two things were evident when the competitors lined up for the flag raising opening ceremony. 
    
	All the players were taller and physically stronger than earlier years and there were many more girl competitors  owing to the Sania factor. All, without exception, had good topspin forehands, double-handed backhands and mannerisms picked up from the stars they see on TV. 
    
	Unfortunately, none of them have imbibed the most essential ingredient of modern tennis  a high level of consistency. Their game were riddled with unforced errors. 
    
	At Wimbledon last summer, Pat Cash wrote in his column that the last 13 Grand Slams were won by players who received their grounding on clay courts. 
    
	Training on clay courts builds consistency, stamina and patience, all paramount requirements of a high quality player. Andy Murray of Great Britain, now on the verge of a breaking into the top 10, in his younger days spent a long time training on clay courts in Spain. 
    
	Gasquet of France and Djokovic of Serbia, the promising contenders for Grand Slam titles in 2008  also developed their talent on clay courts. 
    
	Along with consistency, we have to tackle the absence of good quality match play for our youngsters. 
    
	Anil Khannas (secretary general of AITA) initiative of setting up an Asian Circuit exclusively for Asian players is a laudable idea. It will help accelerate development of talent in Asian countries. 
    
	At a later stage, limited participation of good future level players of foreign origin could be allowed to give Asian participants match practice against better players. Without tough competition youngsters cannot move forward. 
    
	The proliferation of tennis academies all over India in the big cities has not produced any recognisable talent. 
    
	One of the main problems is the very poor prize money offered by tournaments. Competitors are forced to meet the shortfall from their own pockets. They see no future in becoming a professional tennis player in India. As a profession it should offer opportunity and hope for the future; it does neither. 
    
	The Indian tennis circuit must, repeat must, be resurrected.It should be remunerative. Good players should be able to net at least Rs 5-7 lakh annually. 
    
	The ones in the lower rungs should comfortably meet expenses and not starve. 
    
	Paes told me that when he won the Nationals at Digboi about 15 years ago the prize money was Rs 1.9 lakh. In 2007, as I have written earlier, it was Rs 35,000. 2008 could be the beginning of a long night for Indian tennis.

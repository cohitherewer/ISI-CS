                                                   Kirstens role in selection unclear

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Perth: Gary Kirsten, who takes over as the Team India coach from March 1, has arrived here. However, as he currently has the status of a consultant only, its not clear whether hes going to be part of the tour selection committee. 
    
	For now, the stand-in coach/cricket manager is Lalchand Rajput. 
    
	Ill have to get a clarification from the Board, manager Chetan Chauhan told The Telegraph. 
    
	Contacted in Mumbai, the Boards chief administrative officer, Ratnakar Shetty, said: As far as I know, Kirsten wont be part of that committee After all, today, hes no more than a consultant 
    
	The norm is for the captain, vice-captain, coach/cricket manager and (administrative) manager to sit on the tour selection comm- ittee. 
    
	Kirsten is expected to be with the Anil Kumbles till the end of the Test series (Adelaide, January 28).

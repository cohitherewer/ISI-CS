                                Brett Lee in St John rsquo;s on Monday       
	St Johns: Fast bowler Brett Lee grabbed five wickets as Australia dismissed the West Indies for 352 despite another defiant century from Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the second Test Monday.         
	West Indies, overnight 255 for four, was cruising at 314 for four before Lee took five for 59, engineering a terminal slide with reverse swing with the old ball at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. Australia, who totalled 479 for seven declared in their first innings, enjoy a lead of 127.         
	Chanderpaul remained steadfast in compiling an unbeaten 107, his 19th Test century and second in the series. The 33-year-old left-hander, in his 111th Test, struck 12 fours off 236 balls in five and a half hours.         
	Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo stretched their fifth-wicket stand to 132 as West Indies replied strongly in the first hour and a half.         
	But Lees belated introduction into the attack paid immediate dividends.         
	The 31-year-olds second over provided the key breakthrough when Bravo was ruled caught down the legside by wicketkeeper Brad Haddin.         
	Bravo hit three sixes and two fours in 45 off 127 balls and was unlucky to be given out by umpire Russell Tiffin of Zimbabwe. Tiffin added two more contentious decisions as Australia charged back into a winning position. Denesh Ramdin fell to a first-ball duck, leg before to a sharp inswinger which appeared to strike the batsman outside the line of off stump.         
	Next over, Darren Sammy was also unlucky to perish in similar fashion for a duck to make it 318 for seven.         
	In between, Chanderpaul arrived at his century with a slap over midwicket off Andrew Symonds offspin.           (AP)

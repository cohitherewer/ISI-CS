The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tsonga wins Paris title
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tsonga wins Paris title
                      
	Paris: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga won his maiden Masters Series event when he beat Argentine David Nalbandian 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in the final of the Paris Masters on Sunday to clinch the last qualifying spot for the seasons finale in Shanghai.         
	The 23-year-old Frenchman joined Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Nikolay Davydenko, Andy Roddick and Juan Martin del Potro as the players who qualified for the Masters Cup, which will start on Nov. 9.         
	Tsonga, seeded 13th, got off to a flying start, breaking for 2-0 as Nalbandian served two double faults.         
	The Frenchman did not release the pressure and kept his cool to stave off a break point with a volleyed winner in the seventh game.         
	As the clock ticked past the half-hour, Tsonga bagged the opening set with a service winner.         
	Tsonga then went 40-0 down on his serve in the eighth game, but he once again showed his mental strength by saving the three break points with two aces and a smash.         
	He was helpless on Nalbandians fourth break point, which gave the Argentine the second set, sending the match into a decider.         
	Tsonga quickly took command when he broke in the third game, shrugging off another break point with one of his 25 aces.         
	He then held serve to wrap up victory after surviving three other break points.           (REUTERS)

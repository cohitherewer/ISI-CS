The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Steyn cant wait to take on India
                                                     Steyn cant wait to take on India
                    Dale Steyn                
	Dhaka: Tearaway South Africa speedster Dale Steyn is smacking his lips in anticipation of taking on Indian batsmen in the upcoming three-Test series.         
	Steyn, 24, taught Bangladesh a few lessons in fast bowling in the recently concluded two-Test series from which he bagged 14 wickets, and is now training his guns on India who have recently returned from their tour of Australia.         
	The last time he played against India in 2006-07, Steyn picked up six wickets from two Tests but given his current form, it should come as no surprise if he betters his record.         
	I am looking forward to playing against India, especially after their successful tour of Australia. It will be interesting going to India, Steyn said.         
	The good thing is we have been playing quite a bit of cricket on the subcontinent lately in Pakistan and Bangladesh. We won both Test series, so this will be an interesting contest between two good teams.         
	Steyn, however, admitted that bowling to Indian batsmen would be a challenge.         
	It is going to be tough bowling to any of the batsmen, particularly under conditions that they are used to. They have plenty of depth. The key will be to work on their weaknesses and take it from there.         
	Steyn will also rely on his slower ball to unravel the mighty Indian batting line-up during the series beginning March 26.         
	My slower ball really took off when we went to Sri Lanka a couple of seasons ago. Polly (Shaun Pollock) told me that it was a vital weapon to have in my arsenal, particularly in subcontinent.         
	It makes a big difference when you are bowling at 145kmph and can suddenly change gear to 110 or less, said the bowler who has 105 wickets from 20 Tests.         
	Steyn, ranked world No.2 among bowlers behind Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan in official charts, denies feeling any pressure as a result of the constant hype.         
	I dont feel I need to prove anything to anybody. If I do well, I am quite happy. At the end of the day it is all about team performance and not individual achievement.         
	There are 10 other guys playing with me and it is all about the team. I am hoping that somebody else in our team will come to India and take 20 wickets in the series because, if somebody is doing that, then we are winning as a team.         
	The bowler, who will also be seen in action in the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL) in April-May, is excited about sharing the dressing room with rivals.         
	I will have Mark Boucher and Jacques Kallis on my side which will be great but what will be really interesting will be having players like Rahul Dravid and Nathan Bracken as teammates. I believe I will learn quite a lot from the experience. It should be a lot of fun and it is great for the players to be so well paid.

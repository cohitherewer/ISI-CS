                                                   East Bengal put it across Mahindra

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee heaved a sigh of relief as East Bengal bagged full points in their Round XV ONGC I-League match against Mahindra United at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Syed Rahim Nabi scored the all-important goal. 
    
	In a change of strategy, Bhattacharjee pushed Nabi upfront and the 22-year-old striker scored in the fifth minute to stun the Mumbai outfit. 
    
	Receiving an Alvito DCunha through from the middle Man of the Match Nabi, who was standing outside the box, lobbed it over an advancing Mahindra custodian Subhasish Roy Chowdhury into the far corner of the net. 
    
	With Nabi and Alvito upfront, a spirited red-and-golden brigade made a lively start pushing the Mumbai team on the backfoot. They were aggressive with good co-ordination in the midfield and defence. 
    
	Surprisingly, East Bengal switched into a defensive mode after the goal, and Mahindra United grabbed the opportunity. An inept forwardline, however, failed to convert the chances that came their way. 
    
	East Bengal custodian Subrata Paul once again hogged the limelight, denying Mahindra the equaliser with some brilliant saves. 
    
	An elated Nabi said: I am happy that my goal has fetched my club the most wanted win. I feel that if we continue playing the same way we can avoid relegation. 
    
	Sundays win helped East Bengal climb up to the seventh spot with 15 points while Mahindra remained on 21 points.

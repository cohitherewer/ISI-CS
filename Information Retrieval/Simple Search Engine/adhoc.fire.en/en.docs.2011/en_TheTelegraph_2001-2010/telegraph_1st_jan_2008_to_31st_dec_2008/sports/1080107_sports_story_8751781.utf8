                                                    Only 1 team was playing in the spirit of game: Kumble

      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
      Anil Kumble, who remained unbeaten on a gallant 45, walks away with Ishant Sharma, the last man dismissed at the SCG on Sunday 
             
	Sydney: It took only some hours and some atrocious decisions for Anil Kumbles world to come apart at the SCG on Sunday. 
    
	The Team India captain, though, didnt lose composure and tore into counterpart Ricky Pontings assertion that the second Test had been played in the ideal spirit. 
    
	[Incidentally, so shocking were the decisions from Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson that among those left aghast was former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram. 
    
	Itni gandi umpiring maine kabhi dekhi nahin... It was incredibly and so consistently bad, Akram, who is doing TV commentary, told The Telegraph.] 
    
	The following, meanwhile, are excerpts from what Kumble said during his Q amp;A session with the media: 
    
	On the umpiring having contributed to the defeat in a big way 
    
	I wouldnt like to comment (on the umpiring)... The result is very disappointing... A fair result wouldve been a draw... The best result wouldve been a win, but its for everybody to see what happened. I can only comment that we could probably have shown a bit more fight and couldve saved the game. 
    
	On whether Team India was done in 
    
	Everybody watched the game on all five days ... We put up a brave fight and took the lead after conceding 463 to Australia in their first innings... If I look back Ill be really proud of the way my teammates played the game. Yes, we didnt get the result we wanted, but if we continue playing like this, then the results will come. 
    
	On whether its time for him, as the captain, to speak his mind 
    
	The Board is definitely behind the players... As a player, I cant comment because of the Code of Conduct... The Board is going to look into this... 
    
	On his emotions 
    
	Its tough after youve played all forms of cricket, for 25 years, to end up on the losing side like this... It does affect you. 
    
	On fans at the SCG saying Team India got cheated 
    
	I wish to thank them for their support... We fought on the field and, despite so many disappointments, showed a lot of character. 
    
	On the effect this defeat will have on the remainder of the Test series 
    
	As a team we remain focused on ensuring we play good cricket... We did it at the SCG and need to continue in the same manner. 
       
	On not having survived for 72 overs on the last day 
    
	Its a cause for some concern... Weve got a practice game in Canberra and those who havent had a hit in Australia will get their chance. 
    
	On Ponting having breached the understanding between captains on being honest about low catches taken cleanly (or otherwise) by their fielders 
    
	Initially, we did reach an understanding that the fielders word would be honoured when a low catch was taken... I dont need to say much... If the fielder says he has taken it clean, then the captain nods his head and the umpire gives the batsman out. 
    
	On whether, after the Michael Clarke incident on Sunday afternoon (which affected top-scorer Sourav Ganguly), that will be reviewed 
    
	Im sure well have to. 
    
	On his and the teams approach 
    
	We like to play hard and fair cricket... We expect Australia to do the same... Ive played my cricket very sincerely and honestly and thats the approach my team takes... Sometimes, in the heat of the game, you could take chances and then probably not say anything... 
    
	On staying calm despite such a miserable day 
    
	(Grins) You cant do much... It has happened, it has gone... Its over and, so, you cant really sit down and keep talking about it... Its a sport and you try and take it sportingly, but it hurts when you lose like this after having had a great chance of winning and levelling the Test series... Having said that, at the end of the day, its a game (only) and you cant really take it (the defeat) in such a manner that it starts affecting you and your personal life... If it starts affecting the captain too personally, then it will affect the team as well. So, its important to move on and hope that we play even better cricket. 
    
	On Clarke having stood his ground in the second innings 
    
	If you wait after nicking to first slip, then that says it all... 
    
	Finally, on Pontings claim that the Test was played in the spirit of the game 
    
	(Only) one team was playing in the spirit of the game, thats all Ill say.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Souravs wicket was a good one: Krejza
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Souravs wicket was a good one: Krejza
  - Bedi was of great help, but it was more about me being relaxed       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Ricky Ponting (left) and Jason Krejza in Nagpur on Friday. (AFP)                                 
	Nagpur: Jason Krejza took the momentum away from the Indians in the final Test with a memorable performance on debut, claiming eight for 215 on the second day of the match. The 25-year-old spoke to reporters at the end of days play.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	No wickets in the first session today and then five in no time at all         
	I dont know. It was a burst to me. I just kept doing what I had always been doing. Its still pretty unbelievable to me.         
	Is the wicket dangerous?         
	The wider you get, the more dangerous it is. It is going to get flatter, but still its pretty dangerous. Harbhajan was getting a bit of turn in the end as well. So spin will be difficult.         
	Your previous best was a four-wicket haul. How does this feel?         
	Incredible. Its unbelievable, to get the wickets against the best players of spin in the world.         
	The wicket you will cherish         
	The first wicket definitely getting Rahul Dravid. I had worked it out in my mind and it came out as I had planned.         
	How much a factor was the rough and how much did you use it?         
	Down the middle it is still quite true. Thats where you can get a bit of kick and bounce for the left-handers, so its going to be difficult to bowl to the left-handers. But definitely to the right-handers, I was using the rough.         
	Didnt you feel frustrated having to wait three Tests to get a look in?         
	Definitely not. For me, its an honour to be here in the first place. Watching the other spinners play against India was an honour and to be actually playing a Test was an even greater one. So it never worried me, I knew I am going to get in at some stage.         
	We saw you loop the ball a bit more than you did in the Jaipur warm-up game. Did that have anything to do with the session you had with Bishan Singh Bedi or did your seniors ask you to do it?         
	Bishan was of great help, but it was more about me being relaxed. My being relaxed had to do with bowling slower for some reason. Its a by-product of me being relaxed at the crease.         
	What was your game plan and of the five you took today whose wicket do you cherish the most?         
	We changed the field around a bit. Gave myself more protection so that I could attack. (Sourav) Ganguly was a good one for me. There being not much help for (bowling against) left-handers so to get him, that was out-thinking.

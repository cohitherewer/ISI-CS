	Manila: Arjun Singhs even-par round of 72 turned out to be the best by an Indian which earned him a share of the 19th spot after the opening round of the $300,000 Philippine Open on Thursday.         
	Arjun, a 10th tee starter, struck three birdies against an equal number of bogeys for the best finish among the six Indians in fray at the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club.         
	A stroke behind were Himmat Rai and Digvijay Singh at the tied 27th spot, while Gurbaaz Mann was at tied 49th position. (PTI)

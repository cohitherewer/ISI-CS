            A STAFF REPORTER              Ranadeb Bose                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders have decided to release five of their contracted players  Ranadeb Bose, Sourasish Lahiri, Rohan Banerjee, Cheteswar Pujara and Yashpal Singh  by Sunday.         
	According to team director Joy Bhattacharya, the team management, after a discussion with coach John Buchanan, has decided that the players who have not played in the Indian Premier League (IPL) till date will be released, since they have little chance of playing in the remaining six matches.         
	Buchanan, it was learnt, now wants to concentrate on the 16 players who have played in the IPL. However, India under-19 spinner Sayyed Iqbal Abdulla, who is yet to play a single match, will be staying with the team.         
	We had a meeting with John two days back. He advised that those who have not played till date should be released because they really have no chance of playing the next few matches, Bhattacharya said on Monday evening.         
	John now wants to concentrate on the players who have played in the IPL. He said he didnt see any reason to have these players sitting idle in the hotel after the practice sessions, he added.         
	The five contracted players, however, will be allowed to stay with the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise till Sunday and not a single penny will be deducted from their contracted amounts.         
	John had planned for some practice matches where these players were to have been included. But since there is hardly any time to host any, we have decided to release them, Bhattacharya said.         
	The release has come as a relief for Bengal pacer Ranadeb Bose. Bose felt that sitting idle in the hotel room was a waste of time and energy.         
	I am very happy that they have decided to release us. I was quite bored. I cannot express how awkward it is to sit and watch others play, he said.         
	I just want to go back home and start playing. At least I will be able to play the office matches, he added.         
	The management of the Delhi DareDevils, the opponents of the Knight Riders on Tuesday, has not decided on releasing their players. No we are not releasing any of our players, DareDevils vice president T.A. Sekar said.

                                                Sultans make semis
            Premier Hockey League                
	Chandigarh: Hyderabad Sultans got the better of Maratha Warriors 1-0 to enter the semi-finals of the Premier Hockey League on Wednesday.         
	The only goal of the match came in 14th mintue when Hyderabad Sultans earned a free hit just outside the circle after the ball hit Warriors Dhananjay Mahadiks leg. Sultans skipper Sardar Singh put his brother Didar Singh in possession on the right of the circle and the wily sardar took a shot at the goal. Warriors custodian Adrian DSouza blocked the ball but an alert Johnson Ekka slotted home from handshaking distance near the far post.         
	Oscar was declared Man of the Match. Warriors were out of the tournament finishing with seven points while Hyderabad Sultans have 11 points and are currently third on the table.         
	Meanwhile the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) will host a three-nation tournament, involving India, Pakistan and Belgium here from January 22 to 30.         
	The tournament will have seven matches and would serve as a preparation for the team before the Beijing Olympics qualifier in Chile in March.         
	National hockey coach Joaquim Carvalho said a 24-member team for the three-nation tournament will be selected from 40 players, who have undergone the preparatory camp in Bangalore till November last year.         
	Both Pakistan and Belgium have already booked their berth for the Olympics scheduled in Beijing in August.         
	Forty players were in the Bangalore camp. It will be pruned to 30 and from this lot, a final 24 will be picked for the Chennai event, Carvalho said.         
	A 22-member India squad will be visiting western Australia for a couple of practice matches after the Chennai event. The team will return to India before going to Chile, he said.         
	Reiterating his stand that only players with skills and the commitment to work hard will find a place in the team, Carvalho said: Players who possess skill but do not work hard, will not be in my scheme of things.         
	Only players who fit into my scheme of things, which include team work and systematic planning and hard work, will find place in the Indian team ahead of the Beijing Olympics. Our first goal is to qualify for the Olympics by winning the Chile event, he said.

	Pledge by Spain fans  
	Madrid: A newspaper claims more than 10,000 people have pledged to shave their heads if Spain wins the European Championship.  
	The campaign by a sports daily shows how Spain has worked itself into a lather of national enthusiasm now that its team has reached the semi-finals of a major football tournament for the first time since 1984.         
	I, a hardline fan all my life, do hereby solemnly promise, before Marca.com, the countrys fans and the team, to shave every last hair off my Spanish head if the team wins Euro 2008, reads the pledge on the newspapers website.         
	As of Wednesday, the website said more than 10,500 people have signed up.         
	Romance is in the air         
	Vienna: The Belgian referee for the semi-final between Spain and Russia, Frank de Bleeckere, is clearly a romantic.         
	Although his wife Saskia will be watching on television at home she will know she is in his thoughts even during the match.         
	I think of her at the start of every game. I send a coded message, Frank explained. When I know the cameras are on me I pinch an ear and then I scratch my nose. She then knows I am thinking of her.         
	Aragones contract         
	Istanbul: Fenerbahce said on Wednesday they had agreed a two-year provisional contract with Spain coach Luis Aragones for him to take over from Brazilian Zico as coach of the Turkish side.         
	The Istanbul club said on its website that Aragones would bring with him a four-member training team. It said a final contract would be completed after the end of Euro 2008.         
	Slovakia coach fired         
	Bratislava: Slovakia fired their coach Jan Kocian on Wednesday following the teams failure to qualify for the European Championship.         
	The Slovak football federation said in a statement that Kocians contract will be terminated on June 30 and that it would discuss the appointment of a replacement on Thursday.         
	Police seize 300 tickets         
	Vienna: Vienna police say they have seized 300 tickets from scalpers at the European Championship.         
	Authorities say 155 black-market tickets were seized at Sundays quarter final match between Italy and Spain, which had two large blocks of empty seats among the Italian fans at one end of Ernst Happel Stadium.

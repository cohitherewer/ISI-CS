The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rebels yet to get   their dues
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rebels yet to get   their dues
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                            
	Calcutta: A fresh round of tussle between the Indian Cricket League (ICL) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) seems imminent with the ICL authorities deciding to take up the case of 64 rebel cricketers who are yet to get their dues.         
	The ICL cricketers are yet to receive dues worth Rs 1.27 crore from the BCCI on account of their appearance in domestic tournaments, according to a report in a website.         
	BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, however, passed the buck on to the state associations. As far as the BCCI is concerned, all dues of players must be paid. But its up to the state associations to pay the money because they are the ones who get money from the BCCI to pay their players, he said.         
	ICL executive board chairman Kapil Dev alleged the players were being treated like outcasts. It was learnt that former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta is yet to receive around Rs 10 lakh from the CAB.         
	Its something we have all worked hard for most of our lives...We understand the state associations position. But I am sure the CAB feels this is unjustified, the former Bengal captain said. Five other players of Bengal, who joined the ICL, are also yet to get their dues.         
	CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said any letter from the players in this regard would have to be placed before the working committee before a decision is taken.

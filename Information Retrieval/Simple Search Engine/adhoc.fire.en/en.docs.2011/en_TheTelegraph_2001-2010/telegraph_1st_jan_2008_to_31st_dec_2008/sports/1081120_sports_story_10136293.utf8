The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev tired, but confident
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeev tired, but confident

	Hong Kong: With the Asian Tour Order of Merit title almost sealed, a tired but focussed Jeev Milkha Singh would be aiming to carry the winning momentum for a second successive title at the $2.5 million Hong Kong Open starting on Thursday.         
	Im tired but I am feeling confident this week. This is an excellent golf course. It is an old traditional course. I need to hit a lot of irons off the tee and manage myself well. I have to play smart golf. I love these kinds of courses where I need a lot of imagination, said Jeev, who was the 2006 Asian Tour No. 1.         
	Ive played on the Asian Tour for many years and the Asian Tour has given me a lot. A lot of players have done well coming from the Asian Tour. It all comes down to how sharp a players game is and how he is going to handle himself mentally in the last round, he added.         
	Jeevs closest rival on the Order of Merit, New Zealands Brown, will be banking on a new set of irons for a change of fortune in Fanling.         
	I havent played that great recently. I will be using a new set of irons this week, which will hopefully turn things around for me. I really like the course here and Im looking at having a go at it. My form is not where it used to be but Im working hard at it. I have to stay positive and keep working hard, said Brown.         
	Meanwhile, defending champion Miguel Angel Jimenez will be eyeing a third title when he tees off on Thursday.         
	Jimenez, 44, will be hoping to follow in the footsteps golf legend Peter Thomson of Australia, who won the event three times back in 1960, 1965 and 1967.         
	Chinese Taipeis Hsieh Yung-yo is the only player to have won four titles. Jimenez will be bidding for his third Hong Kong Open title.           (AGENCIES)

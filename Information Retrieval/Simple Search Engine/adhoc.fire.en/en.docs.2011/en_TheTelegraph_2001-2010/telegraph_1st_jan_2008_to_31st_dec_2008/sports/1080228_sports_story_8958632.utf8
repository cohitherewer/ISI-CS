The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bacher praises Kirsten
                                                   Bacher praises Kirsten
                            
	Mumbai: Former South Africa captain Dr Ali Bacher feels India coach-designate Gary Kirsten possesses excellent man management skill which will come handy when he takes over the reins from March 1.         
	To me hes a terrific person with excellent man management skill. Hes got no ego problem. BCCI has made a very good choice, Bacher said.         
	I dont think Gary was as talented as his brother Peter.         
	But he worked so hard and kept his focus so well that he ended up as a world class player, said Bacher.         
	Turning his attention to the forthcoming three-Test series between South Africa and India, Bacher felt that though his country has unearthed two genuinely fast bowlers in Dale Steyn and Mornie Morkel, the batting looks a bit wobbly.         
	There are two outstanding fast bowlers. Steyn is quick but frail. Morkel is a giant.         
	I remember the day when my ribs were broken when I faced his father who too was a giant at 6-foot, 8-inches, he said.         
	I am concerned about the batting. They depend a lot on (Jacques) Kallis and (captain Graeme) Smith who is a good player under pressure. But the top six can wobble a bit and Im worried, Bacher said.         
	He also rued the absence of a quality spinner for a long time and singled out Hugh Tayfield as the best ever slow bowler produced by his country. Spin bowling has always been a problem.

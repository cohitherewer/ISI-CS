The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ill ask Ponting to help me out: Sourav
                                                     Ill ask Ponting to help me out: Sourav
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ricky Ponting                           
	Calcutta: Ricky Ponting holds the International Cricket Councils Captain of the Year crown, but hell be playing under Sourav Ganguly in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Sourav, wholl be captaining the Kolkata Knight Riders, is looking forward to having the Australian around. Thats a point he made during a one-on-one with The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On being back as captain, albeit in a Twenty20 tournament         
	Theres a sense of excitement Its a new format, a new tournament Theres a lot of hype So much money has been put in and I expect it to be very competitive.         
	Having last captained (Team India) in September 2005         
	Ill be fresh now and therell be less pressure Test cricket remains the ultimate for batters, bowlers and captains In the Twenty20 game, though, theres little time to turn things around Its certainly going to be challenging.         
	Buzz over the dream combination  John Buchanan as coach and he as captain         
	(Smiles) Thats fine, but the players have to play well. Thats the bottomline         
	Ponting having to play under him         
	Hes one of the best captains in the world and Ill ask him to help me out Hes been one of the most successful too If he helps and that helps us to win, well, therell be nothing like it.         
	Spearhead Shoaib Akhtars reputation for being a problem child         
	Im confident hell perform, thats the reason why I backed him (during the February 20 auction) Ive spoken to him a few times since and I have no reason to believe he wont give his best.         
	On his team         
	Its good, but its going to be judged by performances on the field         
	The seven other teams in the IPL         
	Look, all are good As Ive said, I expect a very competitive tournament.         
	The pressure factor, given the millions of dollars invested in the IPL         
	Will be there, but its going to be much less compared to international cricket.         
	Finally, the position where hell bat         
	Ill open, probably with Chris Gayle.

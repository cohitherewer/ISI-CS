                  Anil Kumble                     
	Mumbai: Test captain Anil Kumble has come out strongly in defence of the starry Indian middle-order who came a cropper against the Sri Lankan spin duo of Ajantha Mendis and Muthiah Muralidharan in the recently concluded three-match Test series which the visitors lost 1-2.         
	I dont know who gave this tag  Fab Four. They have done so much for Indian cricket over the last 15 years. Agreed, they failed in this Test series, but it happens in cricket. We should not forget their contribution in the past, he said at a promotional here.         
	The Fab Four the leg spinner was referring to  Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and V. V. S. Laxman  performed much below expectations in the series.         
	This was the first series they could not perform. I feel its too harsh on them since they have been constantly performing over the last decade, Kumble said.         
	To put Laxman in that list is not fair since he performed well. Sourav and Rahul, although, were having it tough, but you cannot write them off, he said.         
	Laxman was the most impressive performer among the stalwarts, aggregating 215 runs with two half centuries and an average of 43.00 to his credit.         
	While lauding spinner Mendis for his performance, Kumble also cautioned the Sri Lankan youngster to evolve constantly as a bowler and not become predictable.         
	Mendis is an exception bowler. He is certain to flummox opponents with his accuracy, variety and trajectory. Nevertheless he has to make sure he continues to improve so that he doesnt become predictable, he said.         
	Kumble agreed with retired Australian wicket keeper Adam Gilchrist that cricket deserved a place in the Olympic Games and pointed out the success of the games inclusion in the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Malaysia.

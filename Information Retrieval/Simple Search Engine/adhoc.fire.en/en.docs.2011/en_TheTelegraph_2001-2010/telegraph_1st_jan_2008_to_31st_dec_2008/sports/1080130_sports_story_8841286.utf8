	Calcutta: Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary is not scared of facing Brett Lee but is confident of making a good debut if he gets a chance to play in the tri-series in Australia. He has been included as backup for the injured Yuvraj Singh and will fly to Australia. 
    
	I am not at all concerned about the bowlers. I know that they are world class but thinking about them will only add to the pressure. I want to dominate the bowling Thats what I am aiming for, Tiwary said. 
    
	I am confident of delivering my best. I am ready to go out there and play my natural game, the 22-year old said. 
    
	Tiwary made the squad for the Bangladesh tour last year but had to return after injuring his right shoulder during a practice session. 
    
	According to him sheer luck has earned him the chance to fly to Australia. 
    
	I worked hard and always knew that my chance would come. But getting this was sheer luck. I knew that I was among the stand-bys and had a chance to make it if somebody got injured. I am happy that the opportunity has come and will do everything to give my best, he said. 
    
	Asked if he was prepared to deal with the pressure of performing in Australia Tiwary said: Im strong mentally. I always wanted to make my debut against a good team. And I am thankful to the Almighty, Tiwary told The Telegraph. 
    
	Tiwary will be leaving for Australia on Thursday. 
    
	On how tough it would be to play on the bouncy Australian pitches without any practice, Tiwary said: That can be a factor but for the last one week I have been practising with wet tennis balls and synthetic balls. That will help me. But once I reach there I will sit with the video analyst and chalk out a plan. 
    
	Tiwary also felt that the slight amendment he has made to his batting stance on Dav Whatmores advice, during the NCA camp in Bangalore earlier this month, will help him in Australia. 
    
	Whatmore praised my batting and suggested I change to a side on action. I have been practising that stance and it has really helped, he said.

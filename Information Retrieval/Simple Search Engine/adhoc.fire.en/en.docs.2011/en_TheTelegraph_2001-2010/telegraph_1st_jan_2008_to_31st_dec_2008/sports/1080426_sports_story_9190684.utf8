The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ive learnt a lot from Sourav: Hussey
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ive learnt a lot from Sourav: Hussey
  - A knight opens up as kings men brace for Chennai challenge         INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            David Hussey                                 
	Chennai: David Hussey hasnt had much of an international experience but created ripples when he fetched more than Ricky Ponting at the Indian Premier League auction. He justified the faith shown in his abilities by taking Kolkata Knight Riders to victory in their last match against Deccan Chargers at the Eden.         
	Having earned a Cricket Australia contract, the younger brother of Australia middle-order batsman Michael is now looking forward to his one-day debut in the West Indies. The ultimate dream, though, is to play Test cricket alongside Michael, he told The Telegraph on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His short career         
	Professionally I started around the age of 24 for Victoria and in Australia that is considered a bit late. But Im over the moon considering the way things have turned out. Its been a dream come true Playing in the IPL with some great players like Ricky Ponting, Sourav Ganguly and Brendon McCullum. It all worked well and hopefully will continue this way.         
	At 30, if age is a hindrance         
	I dont think so. At 30 you just about know your game perfectly. In Australia generally you get picked up a little later and Im hoping my national call-up is just round the corner. Personally, I feel if a person can do all the training and hard work and perform consistently as good as a youngster, if not better, age does not matter. Steve Waugh kept playing till he was 38-39 Matthew Hayden is 38 now. Justin Langer was 37 I believe theres still lot of cricket ahead of me at the moment. My focus now is to make inroads into the one-day and Test teams.         
	His idols         
	I had three idols. Damien Martyn was my ultimate player and I always wanted to be like him. I thought Mark Waugh was the best player in the world. Brendon Julian was another interesting player and a classy allrounder.         
	On brother Michael         
	I get along famously with Michael. Its a lot better now During the years of growing up we were not that close. Were very competitive, always trying to get above the other. Backyard cricket was bad There were a lot of fights as kids do in their growing up years. He would keep batting for days and I had to be content with bowling. Wasnt a great childhood! (Laughs) But now were very close. We talk probably every couple of days to check how we are Were just good friends now rather than brothers.         
	Saturdays clash with Michael (vs Chennai Super Kings)         
	Michael is a class player. He showed that with a hundred in the first game No slogging, all cricketing shots. Come Saturday and I hope Kolkata Knight Riders win. Best wishes to Michael for another hundred but as long as we get the points I dont mind.         
	Playing with Michael at the international level         
	Yes it is a big dream... International cricket is my ultimate goal and if it is alongside Michael, its a massive bonus for him, myself and the family.         
	Making it big like the Chappell and Waugh brothers         
	Yeah, thats the goal The Waugh brothers and the three Chappell brothers were unbelievable for Australia. Hopefully Michael and I can manage to reach half of those records. Id be very happy.         
	Fetching more than Ponting and Michael at the auctions         
	A bit embarrassing, but very flattering. I felt sorry for Ricky though, since I believe he is the best batsman in the world and a great leader. I think it had got to do with my being available for the whole tournament.         
	The IPL experience         
	The reception has just been unbelievable. Its a different world altogether. To see the city turn up in droves is beyond imagination. Playing alongside Ricky, Sourav and McCullum is a great transition You get to learn so much.         
	The advantage gained from playing for Kolkata Knight Riders         
	Hugely benefiting. Already Ive learnt so much from Sourav. He has played 15 years of international cricket. Sitting down with him and getting to know about different batters and bowlers is phenomenal. Getting to know Ricky better How he prepares before a game and adjusts to different situations McCullum has played seven years of international cricket A world of experience and knowledge is being passed on to me. You cant buy it off the shelf.         
	Getting to know Shah Rukh Khan         
	I was actually presented with a couple of his films the other night. I havent watched any yet but plan to Hes a lovely bloke, down to earth and very approachable. Basically if you want anything he will go out of his way to get it done.         
	Other interests         
	I am a sports fanatic. I like watching American rules baseball, Aussie footie, English football

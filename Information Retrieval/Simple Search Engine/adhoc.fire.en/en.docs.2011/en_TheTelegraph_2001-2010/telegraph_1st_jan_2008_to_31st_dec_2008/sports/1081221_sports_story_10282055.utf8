The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal combat Goa, elements
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bengal combat Goa, elements

	New Delhi: A haze hung over the Capital through Saturday and stood between the Bengal cricket team and their tryst with a place in the Ranji Trophy Elite Division.         
	On the third day of the Ranji Trophy Plate Division semi-final at the Karnail Singh Stadium here, Bengal took two wickets to keep Goa down to 166 for seven but were left hoping that Sunday would not be as frustrating.         
	Admittedly the Bengal camp was a worried lot since they know that if the outcome of the game is decided on the basis of net run rate obtained in the league phase, Goa may sneak into the quarter finals. But the weather office held out hope for Bengal by saying that Sunday would be a clear, bright day.         
	The third day, however, was far from bright. It kept challenging the Bengal team  perhaps a bit more than it did the Goan side  who had to wait for a long spell before the mist lifted and play could start. Then, they were unsure how long play would continue.         
	It was important that their bowlers dropped into a rhythm early but that was not to be.         
	To begin with, the start was delayed till well after scheduled lunch break.         
	And then, only 25 overs were bowled through the afternoon before another spell of bad light drove the players indoors.         
	Bengals hopes of dismissing Goa early and securing a handsome first innings lead were put on hold by the determination that Ryan Ninan showed.         
	Eight overs after resumption, Aniket Dessai was trapped in front by Ranadeb Bose. He had added 90 runs for the sixth wicket with Ninan. Six overs later, Shadab Jakati fell in similar fashion to Manoj Tiwarys brand of off-spin. But the resolute Ninan (batting 66) and an aggressive Robin DSouza (25) saw the next 10 overs through without being separated.

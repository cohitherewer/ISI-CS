The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahesh refuses to team up with Paes
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mahesh refuses to team up with Paes

	Calcutta: India tennis ace Mahesh Bhupathi on Monday wrote to the AITA stating his non-availability for the Beijing Olympics if he has to pair up with Leander Paes. He will, however, be available if Rohan Bopanna partners him.         
	AITA secretary Anil Khanna confirmed that he had received a letter from the 33-year-old tennis star. Yes, Bhupathi has sent us a long letter and has made it clear, Khanna told The Telegraph on Tuesday night.         
	He, however, said that the association would under no circumstance entertain any request from a player or anybody for such a change in the squad.         
	We believe that we have chosen a team in the best interests of the country We are not going to encourage any request from any player or anybody to change it. We unanimously believe that they (Paes and Bhupathi) will be a formidable pair and are a definite medal hope, Khanna said.         
	When contacted, Bhupathi also admitted that he had sent a long letter to the AITA but declined to reveal its contents.         
	Yes, I have sent a long letter to the association I have written on various topics But I cannot refer to anything specific, Bhupathi, who will be leaving for the French Open on Wednesday, said.         
	Both Leander and Bhupathi, winners of three Grand Slam titles while playing together, bagged bronze at the 2004 Athens Games besides clinching the 2006 Asian Games.         
	They then vowed never to team up together for personal reasons but agreed to come together one last time for the Beijing Olympics.         
	Earlier in the day at a felicitation, however, Leander had said, We have played together for eight long years. So, it would be wrong to say that there is a lack of understanding between us. We two are perfectly capable of winning the Olympic gold.

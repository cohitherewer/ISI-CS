The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gilly: Test series will be hard fought 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Gilly: Test series will be hard fought 
                      
	Mumbai: It may not have the aura of an Ashes but an India-Australia cricket series is no less compelling, feels retired Aussie wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist.         
	Gilchrist said if the Ashes has the long history of a famous rivalry, the competition between Australia and India has evolved into its own special status.         
	It has been a fantastic series in the past 10 to 12 years whenever the two teams have locked horns. It has lived up to the tag of an iconic series. As far as history goes the Ashes are important but this (India vs Australia) has its own status, he said here.         
	Gilchrist predicted the upcoming India-Australia Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy would be a hard fought one though the visiting side is relatively inexperienced.         
	The (Australian) team this time is relatively inexperienced but it does not mean they dont know the conditions here. They should do well, said Gilchrist who was in the city as a brand ambassador for an Australian university.         
	Cricket Australia has been sending A teams and other teams to India over the years purely to allow cricketers gain experience about conditions here.         
	India though would be a tough opponent since they are one of the most experienced teams in world cricket with an exciting fast bowling attack and an experienced batting line-up, said Gilchrist who retired early this year after playing 96 Tests.         
	When asked about the alleged racism incident during the Sydney Test in Indias tour of Australia affecting the upcoming series, Gilchrist said, I dont think relations between India and Australia were damaged permanently due to the incident.         
	I think the IPL came at the right time to ensure that relationships were mended. (PTI)

	Mumbai: West Indies Marlon Samuels has been suspended from bowling with immediate effect because of illegal action, the ICC said on Monday.         
	An independent analysis of Samuelss action by Mark King, a member of the ICCs panel of human movement specialists, revealed that his off-break and fast deliveries exceeded the permitted 15 degrees level of tolerance, the games governing body said in a statement.         
	The Jamaican, a part-time off-spinner, was reported for a suspect bowling action during the third Test between South Africa and the West Indies in Durban from January 12-14.         
	Although only his faster deliveries were reported as suspect, the ICCs procedure requires a bowlers complete action to be scrutinised.         
	The analysis showed that Samuels average elbow flexion/extension angle for an off-break delivery was 27 degrees while the elbow flexion/extension angle for his faster delivery was 35 degrees, the statement said.         
	Samuels can apply for reassessment after he has modified his action. (REUTERS)

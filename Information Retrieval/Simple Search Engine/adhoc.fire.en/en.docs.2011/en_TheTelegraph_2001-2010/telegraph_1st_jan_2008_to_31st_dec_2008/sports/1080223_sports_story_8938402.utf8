The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Quality of cricket important: Dravid
                                                     Quality of cricket important: Dravid
                  Rahul Dravid                     
	Bangalore: The Indian Premier League (IPL) is being perceived as the beginning of a lucrative new era for cricket, but former India captain Rahul Dravid says its success and impact will depend on the quality of cricket in the first year.         
	IPL is something new. It is going to be quite exciting and in the first year there is going to be a lot of interest. Obviously after that, it is really going to depend on how it picks up. I think the quality of cricket is important, Dravid said.         
	Because, people who come to watch (the matches) are going to expect good standard of cricket. At the end of the day, this (good cricket) is what would make IPL a success or failure. It is up to the players, both domestic and international, to provide that, said the captain of Royal Challengers, the Bangalore team owned by business tycoon Vijay Mallya.         
	Asked if the IPL was good for cricket in the long run, Dravid said: I think only time will tell.         
	The Bangalore icon player refused to buy the argument that IPL was all about money and said people should look at whether it gives the fans entertainment and good quality cricket. It is going to be about cricket. People want to see good standard of cricket. At the end of the day, it (good cricket) is going to be the most important, he said.         
	Dravid also feels that the price of players at the auction on Wednesday was not the true reflection of the capability of a player and the limitations and certain rules of the auction was the reason why a big star like Ricky Ponting got less than others.         
	I dont think you have to look at what one player got at the auction and compare it with other players and say it is the actual value or performance level of the player based on what he got at the auction. Because the auction had certain rules, limitations and certain combinations... So, I dont think you can judge it (the worth of a player) like that.         
	The great merit of the IPL, according to Dravid, was the opportunity the domestic players, other than the BCCI-contracted ones, would get by rubbing shoulders with some great players in the 44-day competition. IPL is a domestic meet and it is about giving Indians an opportunity to play in the big stage with some great players in the world, Dravid said.         
	Explaining how IPL would benefit the players on the domestic circuit, he said: In the playing XI, there will be seven Indians and apart from the 35-40 BCCI-contracted players, there will be at least 40-50 other domestic players in the eight teams.         
	Out of this 40-50 domestic players, 15-20 are going to get a chance to be in the first XI and play with or against some great players. That itself should be exciting, Dravid said.

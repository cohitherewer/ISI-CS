                                                                                                                                                                                                       Leander back to his roots

	Calcutta: Leander Paes was at the Mohun Bagan ground on Tuesday to share his childhood passion with the Bhaichung Bhutias and the Jose Ramirez Barretos. The tennis star spent close to two hours under the guidance of coach Karim Bencharifa.         
	I called Bhaichung last evening and wanted to do some fitness training with them. He invited me over after getting the clearance from Karim.         
	It was like getting back to my roots as I used to come to this ground with my dad when he played (hockey) for Mohun Bagan... Cross-sport training is good for any sportsperson, said Paes.         
	It was generous of Karim to let me join their training session a few days ahead of a big tournament... Hes a good professional coach.         
	Talk inevitably turned to tennis and Paes felt Roger Federer is still not past his prime.         
	Roger has had a great year, just lost two major finals and people are making so much of it. Rogers set such a high standard for himself... Im sure he has at least a couple more Grand Slams left in him. Maybe hell surpass (Pete) Sampras record in 2009 itself.         
	Federer needs one more Grand Slam title to equal Sampras tally of 14.         
	Paes is pinning high hopes on Somdev Dev Varman. Somdev is the hardest worker among Indian players. He has a good chance of breaking into the top 100 next year.         
	Paes also said that the terror strikes in Mumbai had left him devastated. The Mumbai strikes were such a terrible act, but it has reunited the country and brought the people together.         
	On his own plans, Paes said: The past season hasnt been good for me since I changed partners too often. I plan to play with Cara Black in mixed doubles and Lukas Dlouhy in doubles this season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav MRI shows swelling only
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sourav MRI shows swelling only
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly on Monday                           
	Chandigarh: Sourav Ganguly, who jarred his left elbow while batting in the second innings of the second Test, on Monday, hasnt suffered any damage.         
	Ive been having a bit of tendinitis, thats it... Theres nothing to worry, the former India captain told The Telegraph.         
	Sourav, in fact, went for an MRI which revealed nothing more than a swelling.         
	A centurion in the first innings, Sourav was off the field in Mohali for much of Australias second effort. When he did come on, towards the end of the day, it was with a prominently strapped elbow.         
	The third Test, though, is some days away  from October 29, in New Delhi. Time for the in-form Sourav to recover fully.         
	This is his farewell series.

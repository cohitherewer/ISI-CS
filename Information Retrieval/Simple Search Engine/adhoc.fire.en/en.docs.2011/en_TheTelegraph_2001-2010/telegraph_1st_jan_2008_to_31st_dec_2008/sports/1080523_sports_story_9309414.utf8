The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies 87/2 at lunch
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aussies 87/2 at lunch
                      
	Kingston: West Indies pace bowler Fidel Edwards removed both Australian openers cheaply in the opening session of the first Test on Thursday, but visiting skipper Ricky Ponting led his team to 87 for two at lunch.         
	Edwards, getting some movement and bounce out of the Sabina Park track, caused abundant problems early on with his slingy action.         
	Simon Katich, making his come back to Test cricket after an almost three year absence, flashed Edwards to Darren Sammy at wide gulley in the fourth over to depart for 12.         
	Then, Phil Jaques was trapped lbw for nine, caught at the crease by a rising delivery from the Barbados quickie with the visitors on 37 for two.         
	But then Ponting and his vice-captain Michael Hussey settled in and put on 50 before lunch without looking troubled.         
	Ponting won the toss and chose to bat against the West Indies, who are missing pace bowler Jerome Taylor.         
	He was ruled out with a lower back injury allowing Trinidadian off-spinner, Amit Jaggernauth to make his debut.         
	Taylors absence was another blow for the home side who are already without injured captain and opening batsman, Chris Gayle with Ramnaresh Sarwan deputising as skipper.         
	Australia missing the injured Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke, who is on compassionate leave, recalled Katich and handed the number five slot to Brad Hodge.           (REUTERS)

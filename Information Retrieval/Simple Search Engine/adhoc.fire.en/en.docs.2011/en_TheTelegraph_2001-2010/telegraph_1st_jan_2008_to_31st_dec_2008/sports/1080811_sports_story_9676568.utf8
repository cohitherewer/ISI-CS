The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wada chief sounds warning
                                                                                                                                                                                           Wada chief sounds warning
                      
	Beijing: Weightlifting, cycling and other sports with a history of drug scandals must clean up their acts or risk being barred from the Olympics, the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency said on Sunday.         
	Wada is monitoring these Olympics to assess whether athletes are complying with the agencys drug-testing code, Wada president John Fahey said in an interview with an agency at the Olympic Village.         
	It will issue its findings in November and share them with the International Olympic Committee, which may exclude from future games any sports that fail to comply.         
	Some sports such as weightlifting have a pretty bad record, and that is demonstrated time and again with numerous athletes from that sport, Fahey said.         
	 I think weightlifting understands, as cycling understands, that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed.

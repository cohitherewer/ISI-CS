	Karachi: In-form Suresh Raina smashed his second century of the competition with a classy unbeaten 116 to lead India to a comfortable seven-wicket victory over Bangladesh in a super four match of the Asia Cup at the National Stadium here on Saturday.         
	Opener Gautam Gambhir chipped in with a strokeful 90 off 84 balls at the top of the order to set the stage for Raina, who hit 11 sixes and three fours in his 107-ball innings.         
	Superb batting by the two Indian left handers overshadowed a spectacular 115 runs by Alok Kapali, who hit his maiden century to steer Bangladesh to their highest total of 283 for six against India. India finished on a convincing 284 for three in 43.2 overs with Raina hitting the winning run, a single off Abdur Razzak, despite resting Virender Sehwag, Praveen Kumar and Piyush Chawla.         
	It was Indias fourth straight win in the six-nation competition and it brought them closer to a place in the final as they now have four points in the Super League stage, having carried over two from the qualifying round.         
	Raina, who has been in excellent form in the competition, followed up his scores of 101 (against Hong Kong) and 84 (against Pakistan) with an unbeaten 116 from 107 balls, reaching his second ODI hundred by glancing spinner Abdur Razzak for a boundary in the 40th over. Raina and Gambhir put on a spectacular 139 from 133 balls for the third wicket, while the centurion teamed up for an unbeaten stand of 89 from 70 balls with Yuvraj Singh (36) to finish off the match.         
	Rainas 100 from 93 balls included 10 fours and two sixes, while Gambhir stroked 10 fours and one six in his 84-ball innings.         
	Gambhir missed out on a chance to score his third successive hundred against Bangladesh, when he fell in the 32nd over, caught at mid-wicket by Mashrafe Mortaza off Farhad Reza. Mortaza was left cursing his luck when Gambhir and then Raina got reprieves off his bowling in successive overs due to some inept fielding efforts.         
	Farhad first floored a sitter at point when Gambhir, on 56, charged the bowler and miscued a high shot, while Mahmadullah floored a difficult chance at deep fine leg when Raina could not control his shot. The catches were dropped at Indias total of 97 and 104, and Bangladesh were to blame themselves for squandering the opportunities to make it harder for India to overhaul the target.         
	Gambhir, who blazed his way to his 10th half-century from only 36 balls with a flat six off Mahmudullah to long on, carried on with his aggression even after India lost Robin Uthappa (2) with the score reading 14. The batsman was bowled by Reza.           (AGENCIES)

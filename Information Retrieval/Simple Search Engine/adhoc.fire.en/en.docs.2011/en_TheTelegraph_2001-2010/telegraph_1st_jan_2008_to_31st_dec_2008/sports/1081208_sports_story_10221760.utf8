	London: England will resume their tour of India for the two-Test series with a full-strength squad, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed late on Sunday night.         
	The players were briefed on the latest security update in Abu Dhabi on Sunday before confirming that they had agreed to travel on Monday and complete the Test leg of the tour.         
	The decision has been made and all the players will be travelling to Chennai in the next 24 hours to play the Test series, ECB managing director Hugh Morris told a news conference in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates.         
	Morris, security advisor Reg Dickason and Sean Morris, CEO of the Professional Cricketers Association, had travelled to Chennai to ensure England would receive foolproof security cover.         
	This is a very brave and courageous decision that will be respected around the world. It has been a very difficult situation, a very emotional, sensitive time for everybody and it has been hard for the players to come to this decision but they all have, and we are looking forward to the challenge of playing India, Hugh Morris said.         
	The one-day series was cut short last month following the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, after which the squad returned home.         
	They arrived in Abu Dhabi on Friday to begin their Test preparations. Sundays decision means they will fly from there to Chennai, the revised venue for the opening Test starting on Thursday.         
	The second Test is scheduled to take place in Mohali from December 19-23, having been shifted from Mumbai.         
	The ECB said the full squad would travel to India with an unprecedented level of security.         
	The Kevin Pietersen-led squad was given a detailed feedback on the security that would be put in place for the series.         
	After nearly two hours of discussions involving players, Hugh Morris, Sean Morris and Dickason, it was confirmed that the series would go ahead. The players were then given some time to make up their minds on whether to travel to India.         
	The BCCI and police have promised to put foolproof security in place. The trio would also inspect Mohali, which hosts the second Test, on Tuesday.         
	As part of the security, central access control system will be installed at the vantage points, at the players viewing area and also the team hotel. (AGENCIES)

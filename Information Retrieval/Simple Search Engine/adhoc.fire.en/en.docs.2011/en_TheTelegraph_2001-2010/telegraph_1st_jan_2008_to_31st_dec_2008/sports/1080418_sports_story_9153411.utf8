	Beijing: Gaganjeet Bhullar blasted an opening round of three-under 69 to be tied ninth even though his illustrious compatriots, including SSP Chowrasia and Shiv Kapur, came a cropper on day one of the Volvo China Open on Thursday.         
	Bhullar, a 10th tee starter, birdied the 11th, 13th, 15th and 16th to go four-under before the 17th hole bogey halted his progress.         
	Indian Masters winner SSP Chowrasia, however, had a forgettable day and the opening round of two-over 74 left him tied 66th. Chowrasia would need a solid round on Friday to end up on the right side of the cut line.         
	Worse awaited veteran Gaurav Ghei, who stuttered to a poor round of 76 to be tied 98th.         
	Rahil Gangjees hopes of making the cut too look dim after an erratic round of five-over 77 that has him placed precariously at tied 119th.         
	Shiv Kapur, who would require well nigh a miracle to make the cut after his opening round misadventure of seven-over 79.         
	The Delhi pro began with a birdie and picked up two more shots but six bogeys and two double bogeys to boot cooked his goose in the $2.2 million tri-sanctioned event.         
	Amandeep Johl shot 80, while Digvijay Singh returned 83 to finish way down the order with their hopes for weekend action going up in smoke.         
	French rookie Michael Lorenzo-Vera blasted five-under 67 to take the opening round lead over a group of seven. Briton David Howell was bitterly disappointed to finish on level par after imploding on the back nine at the co-sanctioned European and Asian tour event.         
	The former Ryder Cup player putted sublimely, sinking seven birdies to reach five-under with four to go, but then dropped five strokes, including a horror triple-bogey on his last hole.         
	Chinas Li Chao stole the limelight from compatriot and 2007 Asian order of merit champion Liang Wenchong, snaring two birdies on his last two holes to join six others tied for second.         
	Irelands Damien McGrane and Joost Luiten of the Netherlands also remain a shot off the pace, the former surrendering a share of the lead with a bogey on his last hole.         
	Defending champion Markus Brier of Austria clawed back into contention with a one-under par 71, birdieing his last hole after finishing a torrid opening nine with two consecutive bogeys.         
	But pre-tournament favourite Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland remains six strokes behind after a one-over par 73 littered with wayward tee-shots.           (AGENCIES)

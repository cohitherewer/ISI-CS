The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Olympic security brings Beijing to a standstill
                                                                                                                                                                                             Olympic security brings Beijing to a standstill

	A ring of steel now surrounds Beijing as the authorities pledge to take no chances with Olympic security, whatever the cost to business, workers and day-to-day lives. Armed police have been added to the three concentric rings of checkpoints set up on every access road into the city to screen vehicles for suspicious, dangerous items and people.         
	On some of the busiest roads, tailbacks more than a mile long have formed, prompting even government figures to beg officers to be civilised and convenient in their approach.         
	Lorries with non-Beijing licence plates have been banned from the city, stopping vital supplies at the municipal borders near the sixth Ring Road. My business will be paralysed completely, said Cong Peichao, the sales manager of a firm delivering basic factory supplies around the city from manufacturers in the south-east.         
	But I have to put up with it after all, the Olympics is a once-in-a-100 year occasion.         
	Mr. Cong was on a side road near a checkpoint overseeing the transfer of a load of plastic pallets from an out-of-town lorry to a convoy of smaller trucks hired from Beijing.         
	But the trucks were charging double their usual rate, and even this will stop at the end of the week.         
	On Sunday yet more measures, this time aimed at cutting air pollution, will ban yellow plates, which indicate higher exhaust emissions and include most goods vehicles. At the checkpoint itself, police stopped all vehicles asking, as a minimum, to see car and drivers licences, and foreigners passports.         
	A Swat-style squad of armed officers hovered in a lay-by.         
	While the Athens Olympics also featured heavy security, analysts and diplomats point out that these took place in a city with a record of terror attacks and in the wake of the Madrid train bombings earlier in the year.         
	Beijing has given warning about militant attacks from the restive and mainly Muslim western region of Xinjiang, but has little or no record of terrorism.         
	On the other hand, it is fanatical in its determination to keep out potential troublemakers and protesters, both domestic and foreign.         
	It has put four regional commands of the Peoples Liberation Army on alert. It has linked up the capitals closed circuit television cameras, including those in private apartment blocks, to a central system.         
	Games tickets have been fitted with a chip meaning owners can be tracked electronically. The most noticeable effect to ordinary citizens has been the closing of shops and businesses for reasons ranging from a crackdown on pirate goods to lack of supplies as lorries fail to make it into town.         
	Most economists predict that although business will suffer from the Olympics in Beijing, the Games will have little effect on the long-term strength of the Chinese economy.         
	Manufacturers that are being forced to close for two months said that they had already made up some losses by boosting production in advance.         
	But some consequences are less predictable.         
	Paul French, a marketing consultant based in Shanghai, said Western businesses were finding it hard to get visas for the inspectors they send to Chinese factories to check standards and conditions before placing orders, and were in danger of missing the Christmas rush.         
	He said that some buyers were turning to Bangladesh and Vietnam for items such as cheap clothes.         
	Two thirds of Chinese textile factories operate on margins of one and a half per cent  how much more pressure can they take? he said.         
	Meanwhile, an advertising campaign for Amnesty International combining Olympics imagery and scenes of torture has come under attack in China  even though it was never shown. The images include a policeman walking away from a man who has been shot while lashed to an archery target and a woman chained to a dumbbell in the colours of the Olympic rings. The slogan reads: After the Olympic Games, the fight for human rights must go on.         
	 They were commissioned from the advertising firm TBWA by Amnestys French offices. Amnesty decided not to use them because they were too graphical, but TBWA entered them for a website competition, from where they began to circulate in China. The China Society for Human Rights Studies, a government front, accused Amnesty of distributing the advertisements to smear China and disrupt its social progress.

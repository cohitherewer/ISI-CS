            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT      
	The 29-Day Pune season came to an end on Saturday, much to the relief of punters who had little clue about the mass withdrawal of horses, including favourites, during the weekend racing.           
	The RWITC officials, however, confirmed on Saturday morning that a mysterious equine fever has been the root cause for the withdrawals. On Saturday 38 horses were declared non-starters, in addition to the 19 withdrawn on Friday, sounding alarm bells. As a results of this, the movement of horses between Pune and Mumbai have been put on a hold. Further, the Mumbai season, scheduled to start from November 16, may be delayed by a fortnight.

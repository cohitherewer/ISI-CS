The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky seeks fixed slot for IPL
                                                   Ricky seeks fixed slot for IPL
                      
	Perth: Indian Premier League (IPL) can lure away experienced players from international circuit, according to Australian captain Ricky Ponting who said the cash-rich Twenty20 venture should have a fixed time slot.         
	If a guy is approaching the end of his international career and being able to play 44 days and stay in one form of the game, Im sure it is very attractive, Ponting said.         
	Particularly, if they have families and are getting a bit sick and tired of the travel you do with international cricket, I am sure that is appealing to you, he said on the eve of Australias one-dayer against Sri Lanka.         
	But Ponting felt a proper schedule management to allow international players to participate in IPL may prevent their moving away from the international scene.         
	There are some programming issues the ICC and the boards are going to have to look at, may be carving out a window each year when this tournament can sit in.         
	Unless some time is given up then we might start losing the 33, 34-year-old players from international cricket, he said.         
	Pontings comments came a day after his vice-captain Adam Gilchrist rubbished concerns regarding a possible impact of IPL on the international cricket.         
	Ponting also said he has been left amazed by the massive demand for his teammates among the IPL franchises because he had expected the world champions popularity and brand value to plummet in India after the Sydney Test furore.         
	That amazes me after the last couple of weeks. I thought our prices would have gone right down, to tell you the truth, Ponting said.         
	The Australian captain said the amount of money on offer in IPL was simply mind boggling considering that the world champions may not even play in the first two editions.         
	It doesnt look like well be able to play in the first couple of years. Thats the interesting thing for the next few weeks, what sort of money is going to be out there if there is no chance of playing, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chandhok finishes third
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chandhok finishes third
                      
	Silverstone: Karun Chandhok set the Silverstone track on fire with a sensational third-place finish in the GP2 Feature Race after starting 10th on the grid in his iSport international car.         
	With this, the 24-year-old Chennai racer recorded only his second podium finish this year.         
	That has to be my best race ever in GP2, said Chandhok, who is already a winner in Formula Ones feeder competition after his victory at Spa-Francor Champs last year.         
	My pace was really quick today. Considering its meant to be difficult to overtake around Silverstone, I dont think I did too bad  I passed more cars in one day than I have all season, he quipped.         
	Chandhok gained one position at the start, when Mike Conway made a poor start, forcing the Indian to swerve around his stranded car.         
	He passed Toyota F1 protege Kamui Kobayashi at the Abbey Chicane, Andy Soucek around the outside of the dauntingly-fast Stowe Corner, Luca Filippi at Brooklands, Andi Zuber at Club, GP2 Asia champion Romain Grosjean at Brooklands and teammate Bruno Senna during the pit stops.         
	Apart from Giorgio Pantano, who won the race, we were faster than everyone else, said Chandhok.         
	It was such a shame that I got blocked on new tyres in qualifying, or I wouldnt have been stuck in the traffic in the first place, he added.           (PTI)

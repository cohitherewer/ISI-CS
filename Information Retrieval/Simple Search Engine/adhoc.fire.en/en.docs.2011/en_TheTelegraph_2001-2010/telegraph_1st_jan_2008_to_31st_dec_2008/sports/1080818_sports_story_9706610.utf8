                                                                                                                                                                                                       Want to raise the bar, says Phelps
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Michael Phelps celebrates his feat in Beijing on Sunday. (AFP)                             
	Beijing: Michael Phelps won his eighth gold medal in Beijing on Sunday to succeed Mark Spitz as the best swimmer of all times. Phelps capped a breathtaking nine days at the Water Cube by helping the US smash the world record in the 4x100m medley relay.         
	The victory helped Phelps better Spitzs record haul of seven golds from the 1972 Munich Olympics and lift his overall tally to 14 after his six from Athens four years ago. After his record, he spoke to the media at length.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Q What do you feel about your record-breaking achievements this week?         
	A Its been a lot of hard work that (coach) Bob Bowman and I have put together to get here. I was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit. Every moment that Ive had in and out of the pool will be with me forever. This has been one of the greatest weeks of my life, if not the greatest. From the trials till now, its just been absolutely incredible.         
	How did you work towards the record?         
	When we were training everyday, sometimes there are workouts you dont like or you dont want to do. Bob always said, well this is putting money in the bank. I put all the money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much, every penny in the bank. So, after both Bob and I have a little break, itll be time to start re-depositing. The biggest thing is nothing is impossible. With so many people saying it couldnt be done, all it takes is an imagination. Thats something I learned, something that helped me.         
	Do you think your record will last forever?         
	Records are always made to be broken, no matter what they are. Anybody can do anything if they set their mind to it.         
	Your reaction to a comment by Mark Spitz that if he was the first person on the moon, then Phelps would be the first man on Mars         
	I want to be the first Michael Phelps, not the second Mark Spitz. Never once will I downplay the accomplishment of Spitz. What he did is still an amazing feat and will always be an amazing accomplishment in the swimming world and in the Olympics. Those days when you were tired and didnt want to be there, when you just wanted to go home and sleep and not work out, those days were made easier when I would look at him and say, I want to do this. Im just thankful for having him do what he did.         
	What has been the most important moment for you during the Games?         
	I dont think theres been just one moment. Some of the best moments were away from the pool. To be in the US Olympic swimming team is one of the biggest honours.         
	On what the No. 8 means to you, which is also a lucky number in China         
	I guess its also a lucky number for me too, now. Maybe it was meant to be. For this to happen, everything had to fall into place.         
	Why were you more emotional on the podium than at Athens 2004?         
	I just wanted to take in every single moment, every moment I had with my teammates Ive had so many great moments here in China. These are moments I will never forget. Its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster, but its been nothing but fun.         
	Would you have changed anything here?         
	The only thing I would have wanted to change was the 200m butterfly. I think I can go faster in that event. It was, I think, like a wardrobe malfunction, something that we were able to fix for the last few races.         
	What do you plan to do now that you have achieved this record?         
	I want to raise the bar in swimming. The sport has come a long way and it can go further.         
	Will you compete in the World Championships in Rome?         
	My mums told me Id better make the team because she wants to go to Rome.         
	Will you stay here until the end of the Games?         
	One of the things Im looking forward to is going back to the States. I just want to lie down on my own bed for five minutes at least and relax.         
	How is life in the Olympic village?         
	It was cool to meet Rafael Nadal. Hes my favourite tennis player. I met Federer, too. We saw all those guys walking around. Its a pretty cool atmosphere in the village.         
	What would you like to tell your mum at this moment?         
	The first thing Id like to do to my mum is just hug her. Ive literally seen her for about 30 seconds this whole time.         
	How many times have you been tested for doping?         
	Probably by a rough estimate, including trials and now, 40. Its part of the game and good for the sport.

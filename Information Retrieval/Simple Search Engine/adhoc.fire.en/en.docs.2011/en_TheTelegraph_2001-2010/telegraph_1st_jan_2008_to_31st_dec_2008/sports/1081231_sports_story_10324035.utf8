                                                                                                                                                                                                       Surya makes it six in a row
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Surya Sekhar Ganguly                           
	Calcutta/Mangalore: Surya Sekhar Ganguly (eight points) clinched a record sixth successive title after agreeing to a draw against M. Shyam Sundar of Tamil Nadu in the final round of the 46th National A chess championship here on Tuesday.         
	Shyam Sundar, playing the French defence against Surya, had earlier rejected an offer for a draw. But they reached a blind alley after 30 moves and agreed to split the point.         
	Ive proved myself enough in the nationals Ive no more motivation left. I want to concentrate on increasing my rating points and will look for higher targets, Surya told The Telegraph.         
	The Grandmaster said the turning point were the matches against Parimarjan Negi and Deepan Chakravarthy.         
	Surya, who was Viswanathan Anands second during the World Championship, said he didnt use any of the moves that were discussed then. There was no bar on using them I had to prepare afresh for this tournament. I may use the moves worked out with Anand later, Surya said.         
	Surya, playing for PSPB, is now just two titles short of Pravin Thipsays record and needs another four to get the better of Manuel Aaron, who has won the National A title nine times.         
	Negi was held to a draw by Deepan. Negi shared the second spot with Akshayraj Kore on 7.5 points. But since Kore had won the match between them, he was adjudged runner-up and Negi finished third.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim wants his boys to forget fatigue
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Karim wants his boys to forget fatigue
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: I can proudly say that were the happiest team around. My players look after each other. They share a superb relationship and thats our strength. Its something that puts us ahead of other teams, boasted Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa, on Saturday, the eve of their Federation Cup final against Dempo Sports Club.         
	Admitting his wards are physically and mentally tired after playing four matches in seven days, Bencharifa told the media that this team spirit is what keeps the boys going.         
	Talking about Bagans chances, Bencharifa said: Bhaichung and Vasans injuries are big losses. Weve lost not only a fine striker and a dependable defender but also the captain of the team. However, injuries are a part of life. So were still focused on our goal of winning the tournament.         
	Ive 18 fit players at my disposal and the best thing is Ive versatile players. Barreto can play as a striker as well as a midfielder. Ishfaq (Ahmed) can play on the flank or as a striker. Rakesh (Masih) can play as a defence or as a midfielder. This is a happy situation for any coach, he added.         
	Coming back to the issue of fatigue, he said his pep talk after the practice was centred on that.         
	This is a young team. I told them that many of you might not play another Fed Cup final in your life. Forget all the tiredness and push yourself for this last match so that you dont have any regrets. You wouldnt like to tell yourself after 20/30 years that I played one final and lost because I didnt give my 100 per cent, the eloquent coach said.         
	Bencharifa differed with the view that his defence are a major concern as they will be up against the likes of Ranty Martins, Beto and Joaquim Abranches.         
	People keep asking questions about my defence but I dont think my boys have done a bad job so far. Ive faith in them. Its not about the defence alone, its about the entire team, the Moroccan insisted.         
	For Dempo, the Federation Cup final against Bagan is still about the late Cristiano Junior. It was another Federation Cup final in 2004 against the same opponents when the Dempo footballer died after a collision. We want to win this title and dedicate it to the memory of Junior, Dempo coach Armando Colaco said on Saturday.         
	Although he did say that Bhaichungs absence would hurt Bagan, he refused to admit that it has made Dempos job easier. Bhaichung is definitely a great player and his absence would definitely hurt Bagan. But Bagan are not a one-man army. They are a very good team. Besides, Bhaichungs replacement Lalawmpuiya is also a dangerous player, Colaco remarked.         
	Ranty, whose collision with Churchill Brothers Kalu N. Ogba in the semi-final sent shivers down everyones spine and brought back memories of Junior, said he was also keen on winning the title to dedicate it to Junior.         
	Im very keen on winning this for many reasons. First, it would be a tribute to Junior. Second, this hasnt been a good season for me as Ive been injured for a lot of time. Now that Im fit I want to make it count. Besides, this is probably my last season in India. Ive got offers from some European clubs and Ill be leaving after this season. So I want to win the Fed Cup before I leave, the Nigerian striker said.         
	With both sides prepared to fight tooth-and-nail, one can hope for an enthralling encounter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Robinho wins it for Brazil
                                                                                                                                                                                           Robinho wins it for Brazil
                      
	Seattle: Robinho pounced on a defensive mistake to give Brazil a 3-2 win over Canada in a friendly on Saturday, their first win in three meetings against the North Americans.         
	The result was rough justice on Canada, who twice came from behind to equalise and could have gone in at halftime with a handsome lead.         
	Both teams were warming up for World Cup qualifiers in June.         
	Brazil are away to Paraguay and then host Argentina in the South American qualifying group while Canada face St Vincent and the Grenadines in a two-leg CONCACAF second preliminary round tie.         
	The two previous matches between the sides  a friendly in 1994 and a Confederations Cup match in 2001  had ended in draws.         
	Brazil went ahead after only four minutes when Robinho twisted his way past Paul Stalteri and slipped the ball to Diego, who placed his shot inside the far post.         
	But Canada levelled six minutes later when Julio Cesar misjudged a long cross by Mike Klukowski and Rob Friend nipped in to score with a header. The Canadians then had three clear-cut chances to take the lead but squandered them all. Against the run of play, Brazil regained the lead in the 45th minute with a powerful Luis Fabiano header from Gilbertos cross.         
	Canada equalised again in the 56th minute when Julian de Guzman scored with a right-foot shot from just outside the penalty area.         
	But the Deportivo Coruna player undid the good work seven minutes later when his wayward back pass was intercepted by Robinho, who rounded Pat Onstad to score the winner.         
	Canada substitute Tam Nsaliwa was close to an equaliser in the 84th minute when he shot into the side-netting.           (REUTERS)

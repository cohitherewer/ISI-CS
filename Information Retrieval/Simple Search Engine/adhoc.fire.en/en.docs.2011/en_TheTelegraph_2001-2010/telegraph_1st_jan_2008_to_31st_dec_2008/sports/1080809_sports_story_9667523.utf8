            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: Indian team footballers from the North East states on Friday came out in support of dope tainted weightlifter Monika Devi and urged the authorities to give the Manipuri lifter a fair trial.         
	In an unexpected development, seven footballers from the Indian team, which reached the final of the AFC Challenge Cup on Thursday here, hurriedly called a press conference to rally behind Monika.         
	The charismatic Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia turned out to be the chief spokesman for the group of footballers, which included seasoned campaigner Renedy Singh, Surkumar Singh, Gourmangi Singh, Govin Singh, Bungo Singh and Sushil Singh.         
	While Bhutia is from Sikkim, the rest of the footballers are from Manipur.         
	Speaking on behalf of the players, Bhutia made it clear that none in the Indian team knew Monika Devi personally but were extremely hurt by the way the weightlifter was dropped from the Olympic bound team.         
	She should be given a fair trial, said Bhutia. Let us make it clear that we are not arriving at a conclusion about what exactly happened in her case. But we have full sympathy for her as we do know that at times sportspersons consume certain substances without proper knowledge.         
	Bhutia said that participating in an Olympic is considered a lifetime opportunity for a sportsperson. It was not good the way she found herself out of the team. We are not planning any further action to take up her case. We are only appealing through the media that the authorities out there should also give her a chance to prove her side of the story, Bhutia said.         
	Both Bhutia and Renedy agreed that a few weightlifters from Manipur had earlier tested positive for drugs, but said one should not generalise the case.         
	I feel Monika Devi made a very strong statement by saying that she was ready to be shot if her second sample tested positive. Her case should be handled properly. We can all realize deep down how much disappointed she would be at the moment.

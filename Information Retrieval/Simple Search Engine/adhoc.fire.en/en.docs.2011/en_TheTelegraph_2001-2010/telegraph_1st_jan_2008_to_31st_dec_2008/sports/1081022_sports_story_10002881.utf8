	Chittagong: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori dashed Bangladeshs hopes of a first major Test win on Tuesday with a fighting half-century in the first match. The MoM, who also took nine wickets, hit 76 as the Black Caps reached 317 for seven wickets after tea to win.         
	Resuming after tea on 281 for five, Vettori fell for 76 and Daniel Flynn for 49 to leave Jacob Oram (8) and Kyle Mills to polish off the remaining few runs.           (AFP)

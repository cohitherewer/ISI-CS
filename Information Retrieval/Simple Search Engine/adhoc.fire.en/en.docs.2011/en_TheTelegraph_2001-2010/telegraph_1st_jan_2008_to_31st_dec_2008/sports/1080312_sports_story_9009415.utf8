                                                   Bhajji: Im not arrogant
                      
	New Delhi: The Australians may believe otherwise but volatile Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh insists he is not arrogant but just a fighter.         
	The colourful offie, who along with Andrew Symonds figured prominently in the racism saga in Australia, said he was not arrogant but asserted he would not take it lying down if his integrity was questioned.         
	Im not arrogant but I do stand up for my rights (especially) when somebody questions my integrity, he told a TV channel on Tuesday.         
	The stuff they say I cant even mention on TV you know, the kind of stuff I have heard on ground. I think the best way was to show it on the field Was to play the best cricket. To win the series was the best way to answer people, he said.         
	Since the Sydney row, Harbhajan was greeted with boos by the hostile Australian crowd wherever he went but the off-spinner said he took it in his stride.         
	I think they (Australian fans) love me because they like fighters and Im the kind of guy who will fight. Whenever Im on the field I will definitely fight. I feel so proud when- ever I represent my coun- try and don the national colours. When representing my country, Ill fight for the people of India. For them, Ill definitely fight and Ill try to win each and every match, he said.

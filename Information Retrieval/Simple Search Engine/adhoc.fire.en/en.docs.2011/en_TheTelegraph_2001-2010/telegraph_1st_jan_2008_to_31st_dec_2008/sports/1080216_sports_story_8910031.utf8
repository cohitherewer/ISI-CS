The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Five in a row for Surya
                                                     Five in a row for Surya
                    Surya                
	Chennai: Surya Sekhar Ganguly of Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) won the National A Chess Championship for the fifth time in a row, equalling International Master Manuel Aarons record.         
	Though Ratnakaran posted a fine win over Neelotpal Das of PSPB to tie with Ganguly for the first place with nine points, the Calcutta-lad was declared winner as he had a better progressive score.         
	Arun Prasad of PSPB dashed the title hopes of G.N. Gopal (PSPB) after the latter could not make any breakthrough with his extra pawn. Moreover, Gopal played some weak moves, handing over the advantage to Arun claiming the third position. Arun Prasad was placed fourth.           (PTI)

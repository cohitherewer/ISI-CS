The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds did hit me, says fan
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Symonds did hit me, says fan
                  Andrew Symonds                     
	Melbourne: Andrew Symonds never-ending woes may be compounded further as the man who was involved in the Brisbane hotel altercation, has claimed that the controversial Australian allrounder elbowed him without provocation.         
	The 22-year-old man, identified only as Robert, said he was merely trying to click a picture with Symonds when the burly allrounder lost his cool and hit him with his elbow.         
	I approached him (Symonds) and, although I never asked for his permission, put my arm around him, not aggressively, and took a photo on my phone, he said. It was not my intention to offend him, nor was it to upset the group he was drinking with.         
	(But) as I took the photo, he turned without saying anything (and) hit me in the jaw with his right elbow. I asked what was that for? Im a fan. He said: Im here to drink with friends, not deal with arrogant fans, he recalled.         
	Meanwhile, reports have suggested Symonds missed a compulsory recovery session during his rehabilitation after being thrown out of the national team. According to a local newspaper, the player missed the compulsory recovery session with Queensland in his third week back from cricketing exile.

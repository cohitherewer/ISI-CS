                                                    Ponting: One of our best

	Sydney: Australias amazing last-gasp victory over India in the second Test on Sunday would be remembered as one of the teams greatest ever wins, captain Ricky Ponting said. 
    
	The match seemed to be meandering towards a draw with Australia needing three wickets with only two overs to go, when part-time spinner Michael Clarke produced an astonishing over that triggered joyous scenes at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 
    
	Clarke dismissed Harbhajan Singh and R.P. Singh with his first two deliveries then Ishant Sharma with his fifth ball to hand Australia victory and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, equalling their own world record of 16 successive victories. 
    
	Its right up there as far as Im concerned, Ponting told a news conference. My overall emotion and feeling at the end of the game was as good a feeling as Ive ever had on a cricket field. 
    
	To win a Test like that, coming down to the last eight or 10 minutes on the fifth day is very special, he added. 
    
	The Australian skipper however lost his cool when questioned about a catch he claimed on the day. 
    
	Ponting, fielding at silly point, turned back and dived for a looping catch offered by Mahendra Singh Dhoni but grounded the ball in his effort. However, he didnt bat an eyelid before making an appeal, which was turned down. 
    
	When asked whether he caught the ball cleanly, an incensed Ponting took offence to the question. I claimed the catch and there was no way I grounded it (the ball). 
    
	If you are questioning my integrity, then probably you shouldnt be sitting here, retorted a furious Ponting. 
    
	He, however, admitted the umpiring blunders marred the Test but hoped the match would be remembered for all the right reasons. 
    
	I think its fair to say that there were a few mistakes made but I am not going comment anything more as it might get me in trouble, Ponting said after his teams record-equalling 16th straight Test win. (AGENCIES)

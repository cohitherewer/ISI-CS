            A STAFF REPORTER                                Umar Gul    
	Calcutta: Bad luck, more than anything else is keeping victory out of their reach, believes Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Umar Gul.         
	You know Some times things dont go according to plans We played well, tried hard and gave our best But we still lost... Its nothing but sheer bad luck, the Pakistan quick said on Thursday afternoon.         
	Insahallah haame lag raha hai ke kaal hamare liye saab kuch thik thak jayega And its a long way to go for us Hope things will change for the better from Thursday I am confident, he said.         
	According to Gul, Knight Riders enjoy an upper hand over their rivals  the Bangalore Royal Challengers  in their Indian Premier League encounter on Thursday.         
	In Twenty20 anything can happen. Nothing can be predicted Since this is our home match we will enjoy some advantage I hope we return to winning ways.

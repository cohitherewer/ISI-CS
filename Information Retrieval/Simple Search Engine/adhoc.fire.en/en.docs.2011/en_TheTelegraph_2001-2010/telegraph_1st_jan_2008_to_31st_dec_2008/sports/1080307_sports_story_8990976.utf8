The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith eyes ODI mark in Bangla
                                                     Smith eyes ODI mark in Bangla
                  Dale Steyn during a practice session in Chittagong on Thursday                     
	Chittagong: South Africa captain Graeme Smith, who reached the 5,000-run mark in Test cricket this week, is eyeing a similar feat in the one-dayers.         
	He hopes to reach his goal in the three-match series against Bangladesh starting in Chittagong on Sunday with the other two matches in Dhaka on March 12 and 14.         
	I hope to do so. It would be lovely to reach the 5,000 mark. In fact it would be fantastic, Smith, who has 4,817 runs from 130 one-dayers, told a news conference on Thursday.         
	Bangladesh holds a special memory for me. It will be really wonderful to do it here, he added.         
	Smith reached the 5,000 landmark in Test cricket while he was on 86 runs on his way to 232 in the only innings he played in the second Test in Chittagong against the hosts last week.         
	It was his fourth double century, the most by a South African, as he shared a world record opening partnership of 415 runs with Neil McKenzie.         
	He also overtook the late Hansie Cronje as South Africas leading Test captain in Chittagong with 54 Tests.         
	Meanwhile, South Africa paceman Dale Steyn, fresh from being named player of the series in the recent Bangladesh tour, is proud his name is now being bracketed with some of the worlds best.         
	South Africa swept the series 2-0 with Steyn taking 14 wickets.         
	Just to be put in the same bracket like (Muttiah) Muralidharan, Glen McGrath, Shaun Pollock or Shane Bond, its remarkable, he said on Thursday.         
	The 24-year-old Steyn has taken 105 wickets in 20 Tests, earning him a rating of 893 points to Sri Lankan Muralidharans 907, according to International Cricket Council statistics.         
	It means things are going to my plan and I am enjoying my cricket. Thats very good, he said.         
	Steyn said conditions in Bangladesh had made it difficult to take wickets.         
	Playing in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India, its difficult to take wickets. These wickets are not the same in South Africa. (REUTERS)

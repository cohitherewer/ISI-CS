	New Delhi: Ricky Ponting has warned his teammates to be extra careful about their behaviour on the cricket field as it might look worse than it actually is from the sidelines.         
	Some of those things dont look very good from the sidelines and us as players need to understand they can look worse from the sidelines than they might be on the field, Ponting said referring to some exchanges during the drawn third Test against India at the Kotla.         
	The match, which started with a heated exchange between Gautam Gambhir, Shane Watson and Simon Katich, also saw Mitchell Johnson irking V. V. S. Laxman on the fifth and final day.         
	Ponting defended Johnson, saying: There was no real malice in anything Mitchell had to say. It was about some of the comments that V. V. S had made in the newspapers, to tell the truth. That was all he was talking about. The umpires spoke to me and said it happened three times in the over, I think, and it wasnt acceptable. So I spoke to Mitchell at the break and that was it.         
	Ponting hastened to add that the incidents were not a result of Australias frustration. Id like to think those things arent getting to us on the field, he said. (PTI)

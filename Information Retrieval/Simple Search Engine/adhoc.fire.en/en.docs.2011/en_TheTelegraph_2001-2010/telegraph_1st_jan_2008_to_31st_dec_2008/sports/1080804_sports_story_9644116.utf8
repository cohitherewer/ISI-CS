	 Beijing: British long-distance swimmer David Davies has other things to worry about at the Olympics  he is afraid of fish and his race is in a lake.         
	While swimsuit manufacturers have poured millions into developing a suit that mimics a fish, Davies likes to stay away from anything with scales and fins.         
	If I see a big fish, Id be scared, he said on Sunday.         
	Theyre not human. They dont walk around. Theyre different, said Davies, who will swim in the 10km open water event at the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park.  
	Pope rsquo;s wish

	Weather worry

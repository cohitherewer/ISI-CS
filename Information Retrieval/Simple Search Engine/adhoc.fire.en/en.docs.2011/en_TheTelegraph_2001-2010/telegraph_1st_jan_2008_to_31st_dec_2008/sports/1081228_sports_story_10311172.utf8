The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangladesh caught in Murali web
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bangladesh caught in Murali web
                      
	Dhaka: Muttiah Muralidharan claimed five wickets to put Sri Lanka firmly in command of the first Test against Bangladesh on Saturday, the off-spinners haul leaving the hosts on 177 for nine at the end of the second day.         
	After Bangladesh had made a confident start with an opening stand of 44 in response to Sri Lankas first innings total of 293, wickets fell at regular intervals as Muralidharan ripped through the home batting line-up.         
	Muralidharan made the vital breakthrough with his second delivery of the match when Tamim Iqbal was caught at forward short-leg by Malinda Warnapura for 17, the wicket giving the visitors enough encouragement to take control of the contest.         
	He added three more wickets around the tea interval before completing his 66th five-wicket haul in Tests with the dismissal of Shahadat Hossain, who was stumped by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene minutes before bad light stopped the play.

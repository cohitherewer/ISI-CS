                                                                                                                                                                                                     Its a timely reminder for us: Karim
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa coped with defeat stoically on Saturday, after his sides opening match defeat to Mumbai FC in the I-League. Bencharifa said, This match is probably a timely reminder that we shouldnt be too confident of ourselves, proper respect must be given to every side in this I-League.         
	The Moroccan coach typically refused to single out players from his team for committing mistakes. Lets just put it this way that we made errors in all three departments  defence, midfield and upfront  and we are collectively responsible as a team, for this loss.         
	Mumbai FCs British coach David booth appeared a little miffed at the news conference since no one had informed him about it.         
	But his teams result against one of the traditional heavyweights of Indian football must have surely pleased him. He said, I am happy with the players and credit must especially go to the boys in defence who did admirably.         
	Asked about the conditions and how his side coped with it better than Bagan did, the Englishman remarked, Weve had enough practice, playing in such conditions Wherever weve been to in the last six months or so, the rains have followed.         
	Mumbai FCs next opponents are city giants East Bengal and Booth said he was looking forward to the match. East Bengal are a really pacy side, they played well in their first game... Itll be a good game when we meet them.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ntini rubs it in after batsmen push England to the wall
                  AB de Villiers in action at Headingley on Sunday                     
	Leeds: Englands batsmen continued to struggle on the third day of the second Test, reaching 50 for two in their second innings on Sunday to remain 269 runs short of making South Africa bat again.         
	Alastair Cook and night watchman James Anderson were not out for England, who will have to bat for the best part of two days to save the Test match.         
	England lost Andrew Strauss and captain Michael Vaughan before the close after South Africa had been bowled out for 522 in their first innings.         
	Both of Englands batsmen were caught behind by Mark Boucher off Makhaya Ntini, as South Africa finished the day in complete control.         
	A.B. de Villiers was the first wicket to fall after tea as England wrapped up South Africas innings.         
	Andrew Flintoff, who bowled 40 overs in the innings, took a stunning one-handed catch at first slip off Stuart Broad to dismiss De Villiers for a superb 174.         
	Monty Panesar picked up his second wicket when Paul Harris skied a catch to James Anderson at midwicket. Makhaya Ntini was the last man out, caught by Kevin Pietersen off Panesar, as South Africa secured a commanding first-innings lead of 319.         
	England took two wickets in the afternoon session, with James Anderson removing Mark Boucher when the South African wicketkeeper played on to his stumps attempting a hook and departed for 34. Morne Morkel never looked comfortable against the spin of Panesar and was bowled through the gate for nought.         
	Anderson and debutant Darren Pattinson took the new ball just before tea but De Villiers and Paul Harris remained unbeaten at the interval.         
	Earlier, South Africa extended their first innings lead to 181 runs at lunch after resuming on 322 for four.         
	De Villiers scored his sixth Test century shortly before the interval, with Ashwell Princes wicket the only breakthrough for England in the morning session.         
	Englands bowlers had looked more dangerous than on day two with newcomer Pattinson and Anderson causing problems for the tourists.           (AP)

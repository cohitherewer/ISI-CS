The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pathan brothers back together in squad
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pathan brothers back together in squad
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Pathan brothers will be seen together for the national side again.         
	Baroda allrounder Yusuf earned a place in the 15-man squad for the tri-series in Bangladesh and Asia Cup in Pakistan on Friday along with Irfan.         
	The two last played together for India in the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa.         
	Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha earned his maiden call-up. The national selectors decided to ignore former captains Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid for the one-day tournaments.         
	Dinesh Karthik, Munaf Patel and Manoj Tiwary, who played in the CB Series in Australia, failed to make the cut. The injured Sachin Tendulkar has been ruled out of both the tournaments while Harbhajan Singh is serving a BCCI ban for slapping Sreesanth during an IPL match.         
	The off-spinner, however, will have served out his five-match ban after Indias first two ties in Pakistan.         
	The teams for the June 8-14 triangular in Bangladesh  also featuring the hosts and Pakistan  and the June 24-July 6 Asia Cup in Pakistan were announced by BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah after a selection committee meeting in Mumbai that lasted about an hour.         
	The inclusion of Yusuf was on expected lines after his stand-out performances for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.         
	Going into the semi-final, he has 334 runs at 27.83 from 13 innings with three fifties, and recorded the fastest half-century of the Twenty20 tournament: off 21 balls against the Deccan Chargers. He also took five wickets at 41.60 with his off spin.         
	Ojha was one of the exceptions in an otherwise lacklustre performance by his team, Deccan Chargers, who lost 12 off their 14 matches.         
	He took 11 wickets at 25.81, and his best figures were 2 for 18 in their IPL opener against the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Ojha is not very experienced at the first class level having played only 30 matches, but the unavailability of the more experienced Murali Kartik due to an injury  as reported in The Telegraph  gave him a chance to showcase his mettle at the international level.         
	The squad has two openers in Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. Piyush Chawla is the other spinner.         
	Strangely, the side has no reserve wicketkeeper. That means Robin Uthappa will have to keep wickets in case of an emergency.

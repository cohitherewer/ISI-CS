        Yuvraj rsquo;s lack of form a concern: Chauhan  New Delhi: Yuvraj Singh rsquo;s confession that he likes partying does not make him an irresponsible cricketer but current lack of form makes him susceptible to criticism, feels former opener Chetan Chauhan.  ldquo;Yuvraj is not irresponsible. He is currently not in form and so he is facing criticism. The matches were in afternoon and the late night outing could not have possibly affected his game. He is a brilliant player, rdquo; Chauhan said.  Yuvraj was lashed out at by former allrounder Kapil Dev after the Punjab batsman told a magazine that he liked partying if it did not affect his cricket.
  ldquo;Complacency can ring a death bell to one rsquo;s career. So it rsquo;s important, Yuvraj focuses on game and works hard and converts his talent into performance, rdquo; Chauhan said.  Champions League  New Delhi: Indian Premier League commissioner Lalit Modi on Thursday dismissed media reports about plans to shelve the Champions League, and said dates for the inaugural Twenty20 event would be announced soon.  ldquo;There is no plan to shelve the Champions League. We will decide on the dates of the Champions League after the Champions Trophy, rdquo; Modi said.  Media reports claimed that the plans for the Champions Trophy, scheduled in October, had been shelved.  According to reports, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) insisted on having 50 per cent ownership and some other boards also threw in the spanner, forcing IPL authorities to drop the plan.  Lawson rsquo;s view  Melbourne: Hours before the International Cricket Council decided to keep Champions Trophy in Pakistan, Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson warned Australia, England and New Zealand that they could be marginalised in world cricket if they decide to pull out of Champions Trophy.  ldquo;For certain countries it may well be (a no-go zone). Other countries are very happy to play here, rdquo; Lawson said.  ldquo;Pakistan is a major cricket-playing country. It rsquo;s the eighth-biggest country in the world and it plays our game, and yet people are going to ignore it? That rsquo;s an astonishing thing, rdquo; the Australian said.  Rasel out  Dhaka: Bangladesh rsquo;s left-arm pacer Syed Rasel has been sidelined for two months after sustaining an injury during a three-day game in England, officials said on Thursday.   Rasel, who is touring England with the Bangladesh A team, injured his waist last week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saurashtra gain upper hand
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Saurashtra gain upper hand
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Allrounder Ravindra Jadeja claimed his fifth five-wicket haul as Saurashtra restricted Karnataka to 265 for eight to seize the initiative on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy quarter finals here at the Brabourne Stadium on Friday.         
	Twenty-year-old Jadeja produced an outstanding spell of left-arm spin bowling, rolling his arm over for 30 non-stop overs to return with figures of five for 71.         
	Robin Uthappa hit a sparkling 139 but Karnataka suffered yet another batting disintegration. Karnataka, who had pinned their hopes on Rahul Dravid to bolster their batting, were in for a huge disappointment.         
	The Indian stalwart, who had a not too impressive 2008 with the bat, succumbed to Jadeja on a score of 26.         
	Summarised scores         
	 In Ahmedabad: HP 250 (S. Singh 75; 6/45) vs Mumbai.         
	 In Mumbai: Karnataka 265/8 (R. Uthappa 139; R. Jadeja 5/71) vs Saurashtra.         
	 In Vadodara: UP 242/6 (S. Raina 93) vs Gujarat.         
	All matches to continue.

 - If I keep bowling well, success will always be around the corner, says Ishant

	Perth: A jubilant Indian bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad Sunday said the visiting side had the best attack in the world. 
    
	Ive always been saying that our bowlers are the best in the business, said Prasad. When youve got a good wrist and seam position, obviously the ball swings with the breeze here in Perth. 
    
	Second, they have got the pace as well bowling around 135kmh, sometimes 140kmh, so they can trouble any batsman, any batsman in world cricket today, he said. 
    
	On the 72-run win, which has brought the series alive, Prasad said the Indians succeeded as they stuck to the principle of KISS (Keep It Super Simple). 
    
	Prasad said India won because they banked on their strengths instead of trying to match Australian bowlers speed. 
    
	Anil (Kumble) has been stressing all along that we should follow the Indian strength which is to rely on seam and swing. There is no point in trying to be a Brett Lee or Shaun Tait, Prasad said. 
    
	The best thing about Indian bowlers is that their seam and wrist position is always outstanding. It makes my task easier, he added. 
    
	Prasad revealed Australian bowling great Dennis Lillee had advised him before the match to use the breeze properly. 
    
	Meanwhile, speedster Ishant Sharma, whose incisive spell in the morning session Saturday troubled Australian captain Ricky Ponting and ultimately scripted his fall, was delighted that he scalped his all-time favourite batsman in both innings of the match. 
    
	Its a great feeling to have got the greatest batsman in the world in Ricky Ponting Especially after having dismissed him in both the innings, he said. 
    
	A good ball is a good ball. It doesnt matter if you are bowling at a first class level or in international cricket. It would trouble most batsmen, a shy Ishant said, adding that his in-swingers were helped by the breeze blowing across the ground. 
    
	Ishant got two wickets in the first innings and one in the second, but the quality of his bowling impressed one and all and his long nine-over spell in the second innings in which he dismissed Ponting stood out as one of the highlights of the series. 
    
	The 19-year-old said though he did not get too many wickets, he kept his focus on bowling well. 
    
	Sometimes I feel that I should get more wickets and feel disappointed but then I quickly reconcile myself. If I keep bowling well, success will always be around the corner, he said. (AGENCIES)

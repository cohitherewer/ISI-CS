	New Delhi: Delhi captain Virender Sehwag returned home midway through the Irani Trophy match on Friday because of severe migraine, according to Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) sports secretary Sunil Dev.         
	Sehwags sudden departure sparked speculation that the India opener was upset after the Munaf Patel incident, where the Rest of India bowler had a heated exchange with some Delhi players.         
	However, Dev said that Sehwag was not feeling well and had sought permission to leave for Delhi.

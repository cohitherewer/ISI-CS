            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Vaughn van Jaarsveld will arrive in Australia on Sunday to provide South Africa with additional batting strength for the remainder of the Test series, according to a Cricket South Africa release.         
	The 23-year-old left-hander was originally scheduled to reach Australia with the Standard Bank ODI squad in the second week of January.         
	Vaughn will provide us with cover for both Ashwell Prince and Graeme Smith, coach Mickey Arthur said on Saturday. It will also provide him with a valuable opportunity to work with the national squad.

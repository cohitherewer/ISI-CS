The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo delivers a double
                                                   Ronaldo delivers a double
            TIM RICH                         
	There have been men, usually in cricket, whose game has been disfigured by the cares of captaincy but Cristiano Ronaldo is not one of them. His manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, said he had been crying out for the responsibility of leading Manchester United and on Wednesday night he seized it.         
	It would be hard to imagine his dressing-room speech was especially Churchillian but, in terms of leading by example, two goals in the opening 20 minutes ought to suffice. These were his 32nd and 33rd of what is already a remarkable season and, as so often at Old Trafford, he played like a prince.         
	Ronaldos goals ensured that Uniteds game in hand was converted into a three-point lead over Arsenal.         
	Bolton were never remotely close to repeating their 1-0 victory at the Reebok in November and, in truth, they were flattered by their margin of defeat. There was a time that Ferguson would have been accused of sending out a weakened side. With the core of his United squad rested for Sundays encounter with Liverpool, this was not a usual team but it was young  the average age of the midfield was 21  and thrillingly talented. And it was, far too good for Bolton.         
	Even John Shea, taking his lead from his captain, indulged in the odd, twinkling run forward against a Bolton midfield that their manager, Gary Megson, had packed with players supposedly to deny any kind of space to opponents less aggressive than the Irishman. That and a few stiff challenges were the only weapons in his armoury.         
	Bolton began well. Kevin Davies won the toss and opted to deny United their favoured option of attacking the Stretford End in the second half, but it was just about their only victory of the night.         
	A minute before Ronaldo opened the scoring, Bolton were given a warning of what to expect as Carlos Tevez took a return pass from Saha on his chest, guided the ball past Ali Al Habsi, only for Ricardo Gardner to shepherd it out for a corner. It was a respite of kinds and would keep Bolton safe for all of 30 seconds. They had several opportunities to clear the resulting corner; took none of them and saw Ronaldos shot, delivered from roughly 12 yards out, crash into the net.         
	It was spectacular, but not by the standards of what was to follow. Ronaldos free kick against Portsmouth was considered the best the Premier League has seen but this one, delivered from 30 yards, was equally exceptional. It swerved, dipped and finished in the bottom corner.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

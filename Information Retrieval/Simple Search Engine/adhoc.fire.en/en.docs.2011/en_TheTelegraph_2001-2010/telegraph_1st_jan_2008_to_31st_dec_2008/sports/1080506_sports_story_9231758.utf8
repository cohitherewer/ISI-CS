The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sharapovas threat to WTA
                                                                                                                                                                                           Sharapovas threat to WTA
            MARK HODGKINSON                                Sharapova    
	Maria Sharapova could end up being fined close to a million dollars for two separate issues relating to tournaments this week and next, and that is serious money even for the worlds highest-earning sportswoman.         
	The 21-year-old Siberian has already been docked $125,000 by the WTA Tour after withdrawing from this weeks Berlin tournament, with the possibility of a further $10,000 penalty if she does not provide a medical reason for her no-show.         
	And she could face a fine of up to $700,000 if she decides to boycott the WTA Tours official promotional shoot that has been controversially planned to take place on the eve of next weeks event here on the clay of Romes Foro Italico. So, in the space of a fortnight, there is a chance that her fines could total $835,000, or 420,000.         
	The maximum fine for skipping promotional work is usually $300,000, but that increases to $700,000 for players such as Sharapova who do not wear a tour patch on their clothes. To ask me or any of the other players to do a long shoot like this is not right, Sharapova said. The tour is not thinking about the players.         
	Even if she does, in the end, decide to attend the shoot, it is understood that she has not ruled out the possibility of taking legal action against the WTA Tour.

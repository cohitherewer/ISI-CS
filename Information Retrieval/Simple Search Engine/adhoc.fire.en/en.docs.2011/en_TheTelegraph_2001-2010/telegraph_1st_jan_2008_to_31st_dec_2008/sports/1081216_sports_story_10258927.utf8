The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AC Milan lose to Juventus
                                                                                                                                                                                                       AC Milan lose to Juventus
                  Amauri scored a brace                     
	Milan: Juventus beat a disorganised AC Milan 4-2 in an enthralling Serie A encounter on Sunday to go clear in second place.         
	Striker Amauri scored twice to put Juventus six points behind leaders Inter Milan, who earlier defeated bottom side Chievo 4-2, while Milan now trail their city rivals by nine after 16 matches.         
	Driving rain made conditions in Turin difficult but Italys two most successful teams of the last 20 years still put on a hugely enjoyable show.         
	Alessandro del Piero gave the hosts the lead with a 16th-minute penalty after being brought down by Marek Jankulovski, who touched the ball with his sliding tackle.         
	Milan, without the injured Kaka, levelled on the half hour when Kakha Kaladze released Ronaldinho and the Brazilian set up compatriot Alexandre Pato to crash home from close range.         
	Juventus went in front again just four minutes later when defender Giorgio Chiellini found space to head in a corner and Brazilian-born Amauri exposed more loose Milan defending when he nodded in Paolo De Ceglies excellent cross.         
	The visitors introduced Andriy Shevchenko at halftime and they pulled one back on 56 minutes through Massimo Ambrosinis deflected shot but their hopes ended when former Juventus defender Gianluca Zambrotta was sent off for a second booking.         
	Amauri then squeezed in his second in the 69th minute to leave Milan in joint third with Napoli, who beat Lecce 3-0 on Saturday. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice in the last 11 minutes to seal a nervous win for Inter at home to Chievo.         
	The champions were cruising at 2-0 following quality strikes from Maxwell and Dejan Stankovic but the visitors hauled themselves level through Sergio Pellissier and Simone Bentivoglio before Swede Ibrahimovic was again Inters saviour.         
	AS Roma triumphed in another fluctuating game, Mirko Vucinic netting the stoppage-time winner in a 3-2 victory over Cagliari.         
	Lazio are a point ahead of their city rivals after coming back from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 at Udinese, who folded like so often in recent weeks having been early season pacesetters.         
	In the Spanish Primera Liga Villarreal, down to 10 men for 37 minutes, lost 1-0 away to Sevilla to leave Barcelona eight points clear at the top of the Primera Liga on Sunday.         
	Building on last weekends 4-3 away win over champions Real Madrid, Sevilla took the lead when Brazilian midfielder Renato scored from Frederic Kanoutes flick on, just before the break.         
	Villarreal had top scorer Joseba Llorente sent off for a second yellow card early in the second half and visiting keeper Diego Lopez made a string of saves to deny Sevilla a second. Sevilla climbed to third with 30 points from 15 matches, behind Valencia only on goal difference. Valencia came from behind to beat Espanyol 2-1 on Saturday.         
	Barcelona lead the standings with 38 points after beating arch-rivals Real Madrid 2-0 at the Nou Camp on Saturday.         
	Villarreal slipped to fourth with 29 points.         
	Argentina duo Maxi Rodriguez and Sergio Aguero scored to give Atletico Madrid a 2-0 home win over Real Betis in the late game, that put them fifth with 27 points. City rivals Real dropped down to sixth with 26. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gony stays calm, doesnt say much
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gony stays calm, doesnt say much
    - Mothers allegation against pacer leaves Team India camp stunned           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Manpreet Singh Gony                                 
	Karachi: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was juggling mangoes (hes very fond of them) when The Telegraph asked if he knew about the sensational press conference called by quick Manpreet Singh Gonys mother, Mohinder Kaur, back home.         
	It was around 8.30pm (local time) on Tuesday and Dhoni was moving about on the Pearl Continental floor almost exclusively reserved for his team.         
	No Im not aware at all, Dhoni replied casually. He was stunned when the details were provided. I cant believe it         
	Manager Arindam Ganguly couldnt believe it either. In fact, the Tripura boss didnt even know that young Gony was married.         
	Arre Is that so? Could the problem be the reason why Gony didnt attend todays optional nets too? Let me check with Gary (Kirsten, the coach), Ganguly said.         
	The manager and the coach had a closed-door meeting for almost five minutes before the former emerged from the coachs room.         
	Let me speak to Gony, Ganguly remarked and headed for the other end of the floor. As he neared Gonys room, he ran into the Gang of Four  Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, Rudra Pratap Singh and Piyush Chawla.         
	Koi news hai kya? asked one of the quartet. For the next couple of minutes the Irfans and the manager spoke almost in a whisper, arousing the curiosity (kya baat hai?) of the Special Force commandos and plainclothesmen assigned for protection.         
	Its while Ganguly and the Irfans were talking that one of the two elevators stopped and out came the man at the centre of it all, the strapping Gony.         
	Not wanting to embarrass their teammate, the Irfans didnt say anything, but the manager said Gony, tujhse baat karna hai Apne room me chalo         
	Gony (Sreesanths replacement both in the recent tri-series and the Asia Cup), whod gone to a provision store besides the hotel, then took Ganguly to his room.         
	They were together for five-six minutes.         
	This Reporter knocked once the manager came out. Despite the storm, Gony appeared calm. I dont want to comment Mujhe kuch nahin bolna The Asia Cup is at an important stage and Im focused on my cricket         
	Asked whether he was hurt by his mothers allegation (that hed threatened to kill her), Gony replied Woh to bolti rahengi Mujhe lekin kuch nahin bolna Ive got to look after my game Thats the priority here.         
	State-mate and the Team India vice-captain, Yuvraj Singh, felt Gony should be allowed to concentrate on cricket. I dont know his problem, but its a family matter and people must leave the boy alone         
	But, whatever the provocation, its Gonys mother who has thrown a family issue out in the public.

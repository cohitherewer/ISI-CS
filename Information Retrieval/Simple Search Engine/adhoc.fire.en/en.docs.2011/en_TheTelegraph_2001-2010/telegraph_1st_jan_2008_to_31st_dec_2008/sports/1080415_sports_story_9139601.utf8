	Madrid: Real Madrid took a step closer towards retaining the Spanish title on Sunday after they recovered from a first-half sending off to clinch a 1-0 win over Real Murcia, while rivals Villarreal lost 0-1 at Almeria.         
	With Barcelona drawing 2-2 at Recreativo Huelva on Saturday, the weekends results left Real with an increased advantage of nine points at the top of the table.         
	With six matches left to play, Real lead the standings on 69 points, Barca follow on 60 and Villarreal have 59.         
	Real, who had won just one of their previous four matches, looked to be in trouble at the Bernabeu when fullback Miguel Torres was given a straight red for ploughing into Murcia midfielder Dani Aquino on 20 minutes.         
	But despite a poor performance they managed to make off with the points thanks to a flash of brilliance from Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder who curled a shot into the corner on the hour after dispossessing a defender on the edge of the area.         
	Like Real, Villarreal also found themselves a man down early in the game, keeper Diego Lopez receiving his marching orders when he lunged at Almeria striker Albert Crusat after mis-controlling a back pass from Javi Venta.         
	Almeria striker Alvaro Negredo fired the resulting penalty over the bar and the game looked as though it would end up in a grim goalless draw until defender Santiago Acasiete poked home from close range in the dying minutes.         
	Behind the top three, the race for the remaining Champions League place hotted up after Atletico Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw at Valladolid while Sevilla clinched a 3-2 win away against Real Mallorca.         
	Atletico looked to be on course for a narrow win after Argentine midfielder Maxi Rodriguez put the visitors in front with a spectacular half-volley midway through the second half.         
	But Valladolid snatched a valuable point when Nigerian striker Bartholomew Ogbeche got in behind the Atletico defence to steer home at the near post.         
	Atletico remain in fourth place on 54 points but are only one ahead of Racing Santander, who beat Valencia 2-1 on Saturday, and three clear of Sevilla.         
	The Andalucians claimed an important away win over Mallorca thanks to goals from Renato, Frederic Kanoute and Daniel Alves.         
	Basement side Levante claimed their first points in six games after a 1-0 win away to Real Betis but they remain seven points adrift of Murcia at the bottom.         
	Real Zaragoza are also in serious trouble after being held to a 0-0 draw at Getafe. They have won just three of their last 22 games and remain in the relegation places, three points behind Recreativo Huelva.         
	In Serie A action, Inter Milan reasserted their four-point lead after second-half goals from Esteban Cambiasso and Mario Balotelli sealed a 2-0 home win over Fiorentina on Sunday.         
	AS Roma had cut the gap to a point earlier when they won 3-1 at Udinese, but Inters victory means Luciano Spallettis side have just five games to try to reel in the defending champions.         
	Inters Argentine midfielder Cambiasso side-footed home on 55 minutes.         
	Then 17-year-old forward Balotelli, up front in place of the injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic and preferred to Hernan Crespo, and scored a carbon copy of his first league goal in the win over Atalanta last weekend to wrap up Inters 22nd win of the league campaign.         
	Fiorentina, who reached the Uefa Cup semi-finals on Thursday, stay four points ahead of fifth-placed AC Milan in the battle for the final Champions League qualifying spot.         
	Juventus, 10 points behind Roma in third, took a big stride towards securing their place in Europes premier competition by beating European champions Milan 3-2 at home on Saturday.         
	At the bottom, Cagliari boosted their hopes of survival in a tight relegation battle thanks to Robert Acquafrescas double in a 2-1 win at bottom side Livorno. Fellow strugglers Reggina beat Sampdoria 1-0 and Empoli drew 1-1 with Parma, who have a game in hand at Juventus on Wednesday.         
	Bayern Munich moved closer to winning their 21st German championship on Sunday by thrashing Borussia Dortmund 5-0 and opening up a 10-point lead over second-placed Werder Bremen.         
	Bayern were 4-0 up after 22 minutes, Italy striker Luca Toni scoring twice after Lukas Podolski and Ze Roberto had given them a two-goal lead inside 10 minutes. Andreas Ottl got the fifth in midway through the second half.         
	The two teams will meet again next Saturday in the German Cup final in Berlin.         
	Bayern are top with 60 points, with six matches remaining. Werder Bremen, after a 5-1 win over Schalke 04 on Saturday, have 50 points, two ahead of Schalke in third. Schalke sacked coach Mirko Slomka on Sunday after that debacle.         
	Bayern are chasing three titles. They are also in the semi-finals of the Uefa Cup.         
	In Sundays other match, Bayer Leverkusen beat VfB Stuttgart 3-0 to move into fourth place on 47 points.           (REUTERS)

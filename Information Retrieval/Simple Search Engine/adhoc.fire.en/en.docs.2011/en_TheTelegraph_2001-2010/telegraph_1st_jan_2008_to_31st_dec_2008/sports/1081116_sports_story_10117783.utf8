The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain Ponting finds positives in loss
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Captain Ponting finds positives in loss
                  Ponting                     
	Melbourne: The humbling Test series loss in India followed by the scathing criticism at home doubled up to make it a miserable time for Australian cricketers but skipper Ricky Ponting insisted that far from having a demoralising effect, the setback has made his team stronger.         
	There are positives in losing a series. Losing can make good cricketers with character better. Im sure that has been the case for a lot of our blokes who have come into the side recently and for some who have been there for a long time, Ponting, who himself drew flak for his ordinary captaincy during the 0-2 loss, wrote in a newspaper column.         
	We are not in India now. While it is important for us all to think about what happened and how we played, you cannot live in the past with cricket, we have to put things behind us and move on quickly, he added, urging the team to focus on the tasks ahead.         
	Ponting reiterated that the Indians played better cricket in the four-match series but asserted that the Aussies would be back to their best after having learnt from the debacle.         
	We were beaten by a better side there and now its time to change gears, he said, referring to the upcoming Test series against New Zealand, starting November 20.         
	There were, however, a lot of good things to take out of that series and the more I think about it the more confident I am about the future, he added.         
	Ponting singled out Simon Katich and Shane Watsons performances as the biggest gains in an otherwise poor series for the world champions.         
	Simon Katich was a real positive for us. His form was very good, as it was in the West Indies. We took him to India because he had success there before and he did not let us down. He handled the conditions as well, if not better, than anybody.         
	Shane Watson was a revelation. His bowling stood up as good as any of our quicks and his batting in Mohali showed his qualities. There had been question marks about Wattos ability to stand up physically to Test cricket and he did that, finishing off the tour as well as he started it, he pointed out.         
	Rookie spinner Jason Krejza, who grabbed 12 wickets in his debut Test in Nagpur, also got a word of praise from Ponting. ...it is stating the obvious to say that Jason Krejza was terrific in India, 12 wickets on debut is a once-in-a-generation effort, but what was so good was watching him improve as the tour went on.         
	Ponting also expressed happiness with Symonds return in the team and compared him to Adam Gilchrist.         
	Hes like Gilly. If he gets in and gets going, a Test match can change very, very quickly. You almost need that sort of player in that one to six role, hes good at batting with the tail, Ponting said.

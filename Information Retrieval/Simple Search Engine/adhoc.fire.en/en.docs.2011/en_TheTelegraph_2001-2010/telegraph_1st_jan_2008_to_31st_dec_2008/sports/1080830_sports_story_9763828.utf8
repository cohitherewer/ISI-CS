	Bhopal: Indias only individual Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra on Friday asked the politicians to change their attitude towards sports.         
	Politicians should change their attitude towards sports by ensuring their sincere participation in the promotion of games in the country, Bindra told reporters after arriving here to a tumultuous welcome.         
	The golden boy was here to distribute the Madhya Pradesh governments sports awards on the invitation of the department of sports and youth welfare.         
	Citing example of keen participation of politicians in sports in the US, he said: In US, politicians not only take keen interest in sports but also keep an eye on each and every sport by ensuring their presence at the grounds. People have started taking interest in sports in our country and if the trend continues then we will win more medals in London Olympics, he said.         
	Referring to the progress of China in sports, he said it will take a long time for India to reach the level of the Chinese. Bindra said if India is to compete with China, the government has to provide better facilities and keep aside politics and favouritism.         
	Sports should be encouraged by providing quality infrastructure and latest equipment. The government, Indian Olympic Association and other sports bodies have to play important roles, he said.         
	Meanwhile, trap shooters Manavjit Singh Sandhu and Mansher Singh, on Friday, joined Bindra in lamenting dearth of quality coaches in the country and said CEOs should run sport federations to ensure more accountability.         
	We lack quality coaches in India. Perhaps they are the best available but they should be sent abroad to familiarise themselves with the latest coaching methods, Manavjit said.         
	According to him, Indian coaches cut a sorry figure against their counterparts abroad and there is actually very little that a shooter could learn from them.         
	The fact is that we do not have competent coaches. The foreigners are far superior. Our coaches are just good enough for the beginners, he said. Mansher also had a similar view and the veteran shooter said, The biggest problem here is that for events like Olympics or world championships, you cannot really train under the coaches you have around here.

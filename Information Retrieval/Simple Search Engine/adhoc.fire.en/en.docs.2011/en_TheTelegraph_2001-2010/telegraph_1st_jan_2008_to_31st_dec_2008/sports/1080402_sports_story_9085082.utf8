                                                     Serena sets up last 8 clash with Henin
  - MIAMI OPEN 
  -   Venus lines up quarter final meeting against Kuznetsova               Justine Henin hits a return to Elena Vesnina at the Sony Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne on Monday. (AFP)                           
	Miami: Defending champion Serena Williams beat Kaia Kanepi of Estonia 6-3, 6-3 on Monday to set up a repeat of last years Sony Ericsson Open final against world No. 1 Justine Henin in the last eight.         
	We definitely bring out some of the best tennis in each other, Serena said. And she tends to play really well against me  probably better against me than other opponents. So its definitely a good match for me.         
	Henin, seeking her first title of 2008, wasted little energy in a 6-2, 6-2 fourth-round win over world No. 53 Elena Vesnina of Russia.         
	Actually its a very good memory from last year, even if I had match points and I lost the match, Henin said.         
	It was a day that I understood that I could win against Serena, and that I could do it in Grand Slams three times in the same year.         
	Serenas sister Venus lined up a quarter final against world No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetsova after beating Danish teenager Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 6-3.         
	I definitely feel like Im playing well, she said. Im always trying to take it to another level, regardless. If Im playing on cloud nine, Im trying to get to cloud 10, and actually cloud 11.         
	Third-seeded Kuznetsova sealed a 7-6, 6-3 victory over 16th-seeded Shahar Peer of Israel, avenging her defeat by the same player in Miami last year.         
	Mens world No. 1 Roger Federer had a short day at the office when his opponent Robin Soderling of Sweden retired from their third-round match trailing 4-6, 0-3 because of illness.         
	Federer served well but did allow world No. 39 Soderling to break him in the fifth game of the first set.         
	Its a big difference between not playing at all or playing one and a half sets, Federer told reporters. My opponent was a dangerous player. I think it was good for me to go out there and play today.         
	The newly engaged Andy Roddick, with his fiance Brooklyn Decker sitting beside musician Boyd Tinsley of The Dave Matthews Band in the stands, was tested by qualifier Ivo Minar of the Czech Republic before winning 7-6, 6-4.         
	Roddick won the first set on his second set point in the tie-break when world No. 86 Minars backhand hit the top of the net and landed wide.         
	Roddick was up a service break in the second set, but allowed Minar to level in the eighth game.         
	Whenever you play someone whos won I think five matches in seven or eight days, including quallies, hes got to be hitting the ball well, Roddick said.         
	He plays pretty high risk, and a lot of times theres not a lot you can do besides let him take his swings and hope eventually he might punch himself out.         
	Serena looked in much better form against world No. 61 Kanepi after she made 60 unforced errors against Flavia Penetta in the third round.         
	I definitely had a lot less unforced errors, so I think that was pretty key, Serena said. It was kind of up and down, though. She didnt give me any kind of rhythm.         
	One day after upsetting world No. 2 Ana Ivanovic, experienced American Lindsay Davenport struggled with the wind in a 3-6, 4-6 loss to 13th-seeded Dinara Safina.         
	Thats the thing with tennis, Davenport said. Every day you start over. But hopefully more positives than negatives come from this tournament.         
	She did everything better than I did, Davenport said. I came up against a player today that was real intense and real eager to win.         
	Safina will face fellow-Russian Vera Zvonareva, who defeated Ai Sugiyama 6-2, 6-7, 6-0.           (AGENCIES)

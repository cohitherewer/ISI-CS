The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara century gives Lanka lead
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sangakkara century gives Lanka lead
                      
	Colombo: A valiant unbeaten 107 by Kumar Sangakkara steered Sri Lanka to a two-run first innings lead against India as the hosts piled up 251 for 6 before bad light stopped play on the second day of the third and final cricket Test here on Saturday.         
	Sangakkara dispatched loose deliveries from spinners and pacemen alike with impunity and raced to his 17th Test century with the help of 11 boundaries.         
	Sangakkara also shared a dogged 95-run stand with night watchman Chaminda Vaas to pull his team out of any trouble after they lost opener Michael Vandort.         
	Though the Indian bowlers kept the Sri Lankan batsmen under check, a breakthrough eluded them for a long time.         
	Sri Lanka also overcame the loss of Thilan Samaraweera and Tillekeratne Dilshan in the final session and it would be interesting to see if they can really consolidate on their lead on Sunday, as the track seems to be wearing down.         
	Earlier, Vaas continued to frustrate the Indian bowlers as he dealt with the spinners with caution. The crowd came alive when the left-hander drilled a Kumble delivery to the mid-off boundary for four runs. The pacer later survived a lbw decision after opting to challenge the field-umpires decision .         
	Vaas finally got out caught by Virender Sehwag off Harbhajan, three short of his 14th half century. He executed nine boundaries during his long stay.         
	For India it surely was not a great day as they were playing without V.V.S. Laxman, who suffered an injury while practising in the morning and lost Sachin Tendulkar when he hurt his elbow while trying to grab a sharp chance off Vaas at backward short leg.         
	As if it was not enough, Ishant Sharma went out limping badly in the middle of his spell soon after tea, probably pulling his muscle.         
	The surprisingly thin weekend crowd at this old P. Sara Stadium enjoyed every bit of batting by the Lankans as Sangakkara and other batsmen worked towards taking the team to a position of safety.

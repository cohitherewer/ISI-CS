The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aravinda backs review system
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aravinda backs review system
                      
	Mumbai: Former Test cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar and Aravinda de Silva on Monday supported the umpire review system to be introduced by the International Cricket Council for the first time on an experimental basis during the July-August India-Sri Lanka Test series.         
	Manjrekar, who will be the anchor for Ten Sports during the Test and ODI series to be played in Sri Lanka from July 23-August 29, felt that whenever a third umpire is brought into the picture there is enhanced interest among viewers at the ground and in front of the television.         
	The spectator interest rises whenever a decision is referred to the third umpire. Yes, there could be some slowing down of the proceedings, but I feel bigger culprits are the dismal over-rates maintained by teams, said the 42-year-old former India middle-order batsman.         
	Former Test and ODI batsman Aravinda, who is a member of the interim committee of the Sri Lankan cricket board headed by his one-time skipper Arjuna Ranatunga, said that if technological help is available for the umpire to take the correct decision, it must be referred to the official.         
	When you have a system in place to eliminate doubts (in the umpires mind). we should make use of it even if it slows down the game a bit because you are playing with the careers of cricketers and their future, he said at the function to announce the title sponsors of the series.         
	As per the experimental umpire review system, the batting and fielding side will be allowed three unsuccessful appeals each to be referred to the third umpire per innings, to change a decision if it is perceived to be incorrect. These appeals can be made only by the batsman in receipt of the umpires original decision or the captain of the fielding side. The on-field umpire will then consult the third umpire, who will review available TV coverage of the incident before relaying fact-based information back to his colleague, who will take the final call.         
	The two former cricketers differed on whether the switch-hit, played by Englands Kevin Pietersen by changing his stance from right to left before the ball was bowled against New Zealand recently, should be allowed or not.

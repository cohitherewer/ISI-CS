                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal moves to tied 13th 
                      
	Greenville (US): Arjun Atwal turned in a brilliant four-under 67 in the second round that propelled him to the tied 13th spot in the BMW Charity Po-Am on the Nationwide Tour.         
	The Orlando-based Indian, who shot five birdies against a lone bogey, took his total to seven-under 136 in the tournament that is spread out over three courses in the Greenville-Spartanurg area.         
	Playing at the Thornblade Club, Atwal started with a birdie-brace on the second and third but a bogey on the par-five fifth pulled him back.         
	Making the turn one-under, Atwal picked up three strokes on the 12th, 15th and 16th to complete a flawless back nine.         
	At the top, American David Mathis sizzled with a seven-under 65 at the Brights Creek Golf Club to grab the lead.         
	With a total of 14-under 131, Mathis took a two-stroke over compatriot Matt Weibring (68) in the event, which has Nationwide Tour professionals playing with celebrities and amateurs in a better-ball format.         
	The tournament is spread across the Thornblade Club, Carolina Country Club and Brights Creek Golf Club.           (PTI)

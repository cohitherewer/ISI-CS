The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | French mermaid pulls out of pet event 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       French mermaid pulls out of pet event 
  - Olympic champion Manaudous first loss in four years linked to Internet scandal       HENRY SAMUEL in PARIS            Laure Manaudou after her loss in the 200m freestyle at the French nationals in Dunkirk on Tuesday. (AFP)                                 
	A French swimmer has lost her first race in four years and pulled out of her strongest Olympic event following pressure linked to the release of photographs of her naked on the Internet.         
	Laure Manaudou, 21, known as the French mermaid, said that she would not compete in the 200m freestyle in Beijing, a day after breaking down in tears following defeat at the French championships in Dunkirk.         
	The meet is also serving as the qualifiers for the August Games with two Olympic slots at stake in each final.         
	She achieved fame in Athens in 2004 by becoming the first Frenchwoman to win an Olympic gold swimming medal, claiming the 400m freestyle. She took silver in the 800m freestyle and bronze in the 100m backstroke.         
	Afterwards she left Philippe Lucas, her long-time trainer, to move to Italy with a boyfriend, also a swimmer, but was later sacked by her Italian club.         
	She then left the boyfriend, Luca Marin, and returned to France last May. In December, France leapt to her defence after Italian rivals, allegedly including her ex-boyfriend, were blamed for posting sexually explicit photographs and a video of her on the Internet.         
	Days after the photographs were released on the web, Manaudou threw her former lovers ring into the pool at the European short course championships in Hungary.         
	Now with a French boyfriend, Benjamin Stasiulis, the nation has been willing her on to surmount her problems and reap glory in China. But on Monday she was beaten by Camelia Potec, who is trained by Lucas.         
	Her coach, Lionel Horter, said the intense public pressure was partly to blame for her defeat. Yes, it was trying for her given the pressure that you put on her. It will not be easy to bring back her aplomb, he said.         
	Manaudou has qualified for the Olympic 400m freestyle and 100m backstroke, and could make the 100m and 800m freestyle plus the 200m backstroke.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

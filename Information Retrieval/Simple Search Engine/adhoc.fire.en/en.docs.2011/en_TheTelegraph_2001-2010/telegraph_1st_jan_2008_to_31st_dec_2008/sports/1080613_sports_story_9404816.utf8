The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taylor, Bravo restrict Aussies
                                                                                                                                                                                           Taylor, Bravo restrict Aussies
                      
	Bridgetown: Jerome Taylor and Dwayne Bravo grabbed two wickets each on Thursday as the West Indies restricted Australia to 98 for four at lunch on the first day of the third and final Test.         
	Taylor took two for 29 while Bravo struck twice in the over before lunch to return two for 8.         
	Opener Simon Katich compiled an unbeaten 27 to lead the visitors. Australia began brightly under overcast skies as Katich and fellow left-hander Phil Jaques put on run-a-minute 46 for the first wicket.         
	Jaques lashed four fours and one six in an aggressive 31 before Taylor made the breakthrough for the Caribbean side. Jaques top-edged a pull high into the leg side where wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin held a fine catch running back 15 yards.         
	Captain Ricky Ponting signalled his intent with two pulled sixes but did not last much longer as Taylor claimed him for the third successive time in the series.         
	Ponting, dropped just before on a difficult return chance to Daren Powell, played across the line and was adjudged lbw for 18, making the total 75 for two.         
	Bravo tilted the balance further toward the West Indies with two wickets in one over just before lunch.         
	Michael Hussey (12) slammed one six before he tried another pull shot and Powell hauled in an excellent catch over his shoulder on the fine leg boundary.         
	Michael Clarke, fresh off a century in the second test, went without scoring as he edged a probing defensive shot to Ramdin. Australia provided Beau Casson, the left-arm wrist spinner, with his debut to replace retired leg-spinner Stuart MacGill.         
	The West Indies made three changes with captain Chris Gayle, Sewnarine Chattergoon and left-arm spinner Sulieman Benn replacing Devon Smith, Runako Morton and Darren Sammy.

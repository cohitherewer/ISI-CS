	Hyderabad: With only pride at stake, Deccan Chargers and Bangalore Royal Challengers will lock horns in a clash of the vanquished in their penultimate Indian Premier League (IPL) match on Sunday.         
	Already out of contention for semi-finals, the two teams will fight it out to avoid the ignominy of ending up with a wooden spoon at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.         
	Royal Challengers though have the advantage to avoid finishing last as they have garnered six points from 12 matches as against the Chargers four.         
	 The Rahul Dravid-led side would also have the psychological advantage after their 14-run win over the Chennai Super Kings on Wednesday.           (PTI)

      STAR RACER
            
	Calcutta: The 7-2 favourite Elusive Study landed the 1,200m Calcutta Chamions Sprint Trophy, on Saturday, thanks to a brilliant piece of jockeyship by the Neeraj Rawal. Drawn 12 in the 14-horse field, Neeraj overcame the disadvantage and some forceful riding on the Vijay Singh-trained colt helped him notch up the last-stride victory from Conquering Love. The latter was trying to win from the start.RESULTS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Umpire referrals on trial in Indo-Pak series
                                                                                                                                                                                           Umpire referrals on trial in Indo-Pak series
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The three-Test series between India and Pakistan next year is one of the four series that the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday shortlisted for continuing the trial of the umpire decision review system.         
	On the opening day of the two-day Executive Board meeting in Dubai, the ICC reviewed a report on the referral system that was first put on trial during this years India-Sri Lanka series.         
	It (the Board) agreed to extend the trial to the following four upcoming series, pending agreement from the relevant chief executives, the ICC said in a statement.         
	The India-Pakistan series is scheduled in January-February.         
	The other three series that have been shortlisted for the extended trial are between New Zealand and the West Indies in December, England versus West Indies and the South Africa versus Australia series in February-March.         
	The ICC said further trials were being carried out to provide exposure to the system for as many Match Referees, umpires and players as possible ahead of a decision on whether it should be implemented permanently.         
	That would be something to be debated firstly by the ICCs cricket committee, in April-May next year.         
	The system has so far evoked mixed response with officials giving a thumbs-up but the players not too happy with it.         
	Also up for discussion was the Future Tours Programme (FTP) post-2012.         
	With the current FTP due to run out in May 2012, the ICC Board discussed the concept of an alternative structure to bilateral tours, including the possibility of a Test championship.         
	The concept is something that has been previously looked into by both the ICC Chief Executives Committee (CEC) and the ICC Board during meetings in Dubai in June/July and September.         
	It was agreed to look at refinements to the model for further consideration by the CEC in December and then the ICC Board in January 2009.         
	The ICC also discussed the possibility of cricket being part of a future Olympic Games.         
	It was agreed that ICC management continue research on the matter and present to the Board at a later date.         
	If cricket wished to be part of the 2020 Olympic Games then it would have to make an application to the International Olympic Committee before 2013.         
	The Board decided to re-schedule next years World Cup qualifiers in South Africa after the Emirates Cricket Board, the original hosts, expressed its inability to stage the tournament in April 2009 because not all venues required would be ready in time.         
	New regulations         
	New regulations governing official and unofficial cricket were also discussed following work by a sub-committee made up of ICC legal head David Becker, Shashank Manohar, Giles Clarke, Norman Arendse and Lalit Modi.         
	It was agreed that a final draft be submitted to the directors for consideration and approval.

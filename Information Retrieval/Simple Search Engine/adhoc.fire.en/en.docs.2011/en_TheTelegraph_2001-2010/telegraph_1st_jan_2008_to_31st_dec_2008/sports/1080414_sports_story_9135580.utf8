The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni is ready to step into Kumbles shoes full time 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dhoni is ready to step into Kumbles shoes full time 
  - He rsquo;s a natural leader... There rsquo;s nothing cosmetic about him, says Ramiz
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                           
	Calcutta: Virender Sehwags 319 at the Chepauk, last month, made some whisper whether the selectors had been right in removing him as vice-captain after the 2006-07 season ODIs in South Africa.         
	[Briefly, that job went to V.V.S. Laxman before Sachin Tendulkar became Rahul Dravids deputy. Everything changed with Dravid stepping down last September.]         
	Well, if anything, Team Indias eight-wicket win at the Green Park has firmly settled the line of succession in Test cricket once Anil Kumble decides to quit that form too.         
	Clearly, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (who is in only his fourth season as an India cricketer) couldnt have hoped for a better debut as Test captain, albeit in a stand-in capacity.         
	Just as senior pro Sourav Ganguly couldnt have hoped for a more statement-making finish in his first series-appearance in the India colours after being dropped for the recent ODIs in Australia.         
	An average of exactly 100.00 in a Test where the visitors managed no more than 121 in their second innings says a lot. No wonder Sourav walked away with another MoM award, his sixth in the sports most elite form.         
	Returning to Dhoni, his captaincy over the three days in the heat and dust of Kanpur caught the eye as much as Souravs top quality batting and MoS Harbhajan Singhs teasing off-spin.         
	There was a willingness to gamble, which manifested itself through smart bowling changes. Dhoni was also flexible with the batting order (a case in point being Souravs promotion in innings No.2) and showed that he was comfortable backing his instincts.         
	Dhonis a natural leader... Theres nothing cosmetic about him... He was thrust into a tough situation, with India having to win the Test to level the series, and he handled situations very well, former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja told The Telegraph.         
	Ramiz, who was on the TV commentary panel during the three-Test series, added: I liked Dhonis calmness and the manner in which he took decisions rather simply and quickly... Then, he didnt fret if somebody gave away an extra run... He didnt allow such things to fluster him...         
	Youve got such a good leader who can, at any time, step into Kumbles shoes full-time... Dhonis lucky as well but, then, I guess successful captains have to be so.         
	The win at the Green Park comes as the latest addition in Dhonis impressive CV. It follows successes in the inaugural World Twenty20, ODIs at home versus Pakistan and in the tri-series in Australia.         
	All within seven months.

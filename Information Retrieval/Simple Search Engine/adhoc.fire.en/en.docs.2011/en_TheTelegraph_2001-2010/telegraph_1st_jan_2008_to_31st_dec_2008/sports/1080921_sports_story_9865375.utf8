	Louisville: Even with Sergio Garcia and Lee Westwood reduced to the role of spectators, the Europeans cut into the commanding US lead at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.         
	The Europeans closed a three-point deficit to 7-5 by winning two matches and halving another at Valhalla Golf Club. Jim Furyk and Kenny Perry gave the Americans their only outright win of the morning alternate-shot matches, beating Padraig Harrington and Robert Karlsson 3-and-1.         
	The US took a stunning loss when Phil Mickelson and Anthony Kim, who played so well the first day, squandered a 4-up lead after six holes.         
	Henrik Stenson and unheralded Englishman Oliver Wilson, the only player to sit out both sessions Friday, closed out the match 2-and-1 when Wilson rolled in a 30-foot birdie at No. 17.         
	Ian Poulter and Justin Rose kept up their solid play, giving the Europeans the first point of the day. They defeated Stewart Cink and Chad Campbell 4-and-3, wrapping it up at No. 15 when the erratic American duo posted their fourth bogey of a round that also included a double bogey.         
	Cink lost two balls, burying his tee shot in a hazard at No. 2 and chunking one into the water at No. 7.         
	Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan, who won their two matches Friday, had a chance to give the Americans another full point when Leonard rolled in an 18-foot birdie at the 17th for his teams first lead of the round. But Mahans tee shot at the par-5 final hole skidded through a bunker left of the fairway and wound up on a steep up-slope.         
	Leonard could have salvaged the match with another clutch putt, but his 12-footer wouldnt drop. Graeme McDowell, paired with Miguel Angel Jimenez, calmly sank his birdie from 5 feet to gain a crucial halve for the Europeans.         
	It was a good half, Leonard said. I would love to have made that putt at 18, but both sides played well.         
	Mickelson and Kim fell apart after a dynamic start, failing to make a birdie after the fifth hole on a course designed for going low. The Europeans squared the match at No. 12 after Kim drove into a thick pile of leaves far right of the fairway and Mickelson failed to get it out.         
	The US pair squandered a chance to regain the lead with a three-putt bogey at No. 14, then got into all sorts of trouble again at the 15th. Mickelson again missed the fairway, and Kim tried an unnecessarily bold shot around a tree, the ball striking a European official right of the fairway and plopping into a creek.         
	Fortunately for the Americans, Furyk and Perry led from start to finish in their match to prevent the Europeans from getting closer.         
	Harrington and Karlsson bogeyed the first and never caught up, trailing by as many four holes before the US closed it out with a conceded birdie at No. 17. The Americans big lead after the opening day prompted European captain Nick Faldo to curiously rest Garcia and Westwood, the two longest-serving members of his team.         
	Westwood had appeared in 27 straight matches, Garcia in 22.         
	Its a brutal week mentally and physically, Faldo said shortly after the first match teed off. I thought fresh legs today were important.         
	Westwood had blisters on his hands but never asked to sit out.         
	Garcia also took in the morning matches from a cart.         
	Westwood was benched despite halving his two matches Friday, which stretched his unbeaten streak to 12 straight matches  tying Arnold Palmer for the longest in Ryder Cup history. But the decision worked out fine for the Europeans, who certainly played better than they did Friday.         
	Both Garcia and Westwood were back in the lineup for the afternoon best-ball matches, though Faldo split up his most effective team, Poulter and Rose, who won two matches.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Infuriated   Dhoni lets questions linger
            A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Bangalore: A livid Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Saturday neither exactly confirmed nor clearly denied reports that he had threatened to resign as captain after failing to retain R.P. Singh in the team for the fourth and fifth one-day Internationals.         
	He also said that matters discussed in selection meetings being leaked and reported in the media was disgusting and disrespectful.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His reaction to reports that he wanted to quit as captain         
	I dont know where the report came from. It cannot be a report It is disgusting and disrespectful when what happens inside a meeting when the selectors, the captain and the coaches are there comes out. Things like this should not be happening.         
	On what happened in the selection meeting         
	Im not saying something happened at the meeting, but over the years we have seen things being leaked from meetings and things getting out. We are selecting 15 guys for the Indian team. There will be debates inside and that information should not be put out in the media. If it is meant to come out, then I can say we might as well have the whole meeting telecast live on television. Nobody knows what was discussed except the eight guys in the meeting. And only they know whether its the truth or not.         
	If he spoke to the Board on the issue         
	I didnt speak to the Board. I didnt think it was important. There is a lot that goes around. We have an important match coming up and we chose instead to focus on that match. We were worried about the practice session as well because of the rain. This is a selection thing and personally I dont discuss anything outside. If anything does come out, I would prefer it to be either through the BCCI, the chief selector or the group of selectors.         
	If its a distraction for the team         
	To some extent it does distract us. The good part is that we trust each other Every player in the team trusts each other.         
	On Sachins return         
	Its always a pleasure to have Sachin in the side, no matter at which venue or who the opposition is. The amount of experience he has got, he can guide the batsmen and the bowlers especially at the start of the batting power play.         
	On the batting order         
	Usually I do not announce the playing eleven a day before the match, but there is a good chance that Sachin will open the innings. I prefer Sachin opening with Sehwag. We have tried that and you can say that is an option. Its a good prospect that Gautam (Gambhir) will shift to number three in the batting order.         
	If Sachin is fully fit         
	As of now Sachin is 110 per cent fit Yes tampering with a successful line-up is something you have to think twice before doing, but you also have to see the quality of the player coming in. Sachin needed a bit of rest and he is the person who knows his body the best. We want him to play as long as possible and whenever he is available he should play.         
	On Indias performance         
	As a team we are quite satisfied with what we have achieved. There arent too many individuals who can say its solely because of me that the team has done well. Even in the CB Series in Australia, we started off with a loss in the Twenty20 game.

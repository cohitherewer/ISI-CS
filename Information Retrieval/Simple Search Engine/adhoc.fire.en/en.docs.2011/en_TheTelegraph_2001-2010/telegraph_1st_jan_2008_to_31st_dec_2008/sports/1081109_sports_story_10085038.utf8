The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team dinner in Anil, Sourav honour
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Team dinner in Anil, Sourav honour
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly in Nagpur on Saturday. (AP)                           
	Nagpur: For a change, the end of a home series, on Monday, wont see the Team India players rushing to take the first flight to the city where they reside.         
	Reason: A team dinner to honour former captains Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly. Kumble retired at the end of the last Test against Australia, Sourav is doing so here.         
	Its going to be for the players only (no special invitees, in other words)... As you know, team dinners are a pretty regular feature, but this one will be special, in honour of Kumble and Sourav, a member of the support staff told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	He added: At this moment, its not clear whether presentations will also be made to both on behalf of the team.         
	Unless the Australians pull off what will have to be a remarkable win, and draw the series, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is going to be Indias.         
	Mondays dinner, therefore, could be even more special.         
	Kumble, who returned to Bangalore (for a family function) after Thursdays felicitation by the Board, is coming back on Sunday.         
	The in-form Gautam Gambhir, who had to miss the ongoing Test because of the one-match ban, will also be returning for the dinner.         
	After receiving the Boards permission to go home, Gambhir went to New Delhi on Friday.         
	Meanwhile, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is staying in a room and not a suite (at the Pride Hotel) as he gave it up in Souravs favour, to allow the Ganguly family some space.         
	Dona and Sana have been in Nagpur from Wednesday.         
	The three other suites on that floor have been occupied by the coaches (Gary Kirsten, Tim Nielsen) and the Team India physio, Nitin Patel.         
	Incidentally, Dhonis counterpart, Ricky Ponting, has been given the hotels best room  the presidential suite.         
	Hospitality at its best.

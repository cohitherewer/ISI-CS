	New Delhi: With only 48 hours to go for the AFC Challenge Cup to start in Hyderabad, the Indian team could not go through their full training session on Monday because of a poor practice pitch.         
	According to information received here, the Indians reached the Police Ground in Hyderabad this evening, but the national coach, Bob Houghton stopped the practice after 45 minutes.         
	The ground was in poor shape and was not fit for practice, sources said. The boys did go through their physical exercises but the coach didnt allow the full practice session.         
	Later, Houghton said he was disappointed with the ground conditions. He pointed out that it was impossible to improve the standard of the game without proper practice facilities available.         
	He said that better facilities are available in many Asian countries these days.         
	Hyderabad, once famous for producing top footballers, doesnt seem to have too many good football grounds. Houghton was in favour of hosting the tournament at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, but it had to be shifted out after the organisers failed to prepare the pitch.

                                                   Kumble: Let cricket do the talking
                      
	Dubai: Test captain Anil Kumble, who led Team India during their controversy-ridden tour of Australia, has said cricket should do the talking to counter sledging.         
	I believe cricket can do the talking. It is the best way to counter sledging, said the veteran leg-spinner on the sidelines of a promotional on Wednesday.         
	Kumble said on-field banter should remain on the field.         
	Verbal duels have always been there. It is nothing new to cricket or any other sport. I firmly believe that whatever happens on the field should remain there, he was quoted as saying in a local newspaper.         
	On Indias aggressive approach, Kumble said it isnt new. It is wrong to say that in the past we were not aggressive.         
	The veteran leggie praised the one-day squad for their tri-series win in Australia.         
	The youngsters are highly skilful and have done well. We have now portrayed our confidence and skill and executed it perfectly in Australia, especially in the one-dayers, he said.

	The latest legend of Romes magnificent Trevi Fountain is that you need to throw three coins into the water, with your left hand and over your right shoulder, to be sure of your return to the Eternal City. Chelsea would have been well advised to try this before catching their flight back from Fiumicino Airport last night, using one coin for each of the three goals that they so carelessly shipped against Roma, and that cast serious doubt over their chances of coming back to the Olympic Stadium for the Champions League final next May.         
	Roma have built much of their own reputation around Francesco Totti, their totemic forward, but it was his strike partner, a marauding Montenegrin in the shape of Mirko Vucinic, who proved Chelseas nemesis here. Vucinic, emboldened by Christian Panuccis first-half goal, announced his presence with one superb, swerving drive, then outpaced John Obi Mikel with a mazy 50-yard run for an even more impressive solo effort.         
	His contribution shot to pieces the notion that Roma were a spent force, despite their position of fourth from bottom in Serie A. It also dismantled the logic that Luiz Felipe Scolari can guide Chelsea to the Champions League title on the strength of their defensive record. Where Scolari could have dismissed the recent home league defeat by Liverpool, the evidence here was stark: the firm foundations on which this team are built have started to creak.         
	Chelsea had prepared for this match by spending Tuesday morning at St Peters Basilica and the Vatican. The occasion was of signal importance to Scolari, a devout Catholic born of Italian parents.         
	Their encounter with Roma, however, threatened to be overshadowed by storms of a Biblical magnitude that left a 13-year-old boy dead. The game was in danger of being called off before a pitch inspection by referee Luis Medina Cantalejo allowed play to go ahead.         
	Even before a ball had been kicked in anger, Luciano Spalletti, the Roma manager, besieged after his teams dismal run in Serie A, stressed his resolve by ordering Totti to play through the pain of an inflamed knee, while abandoning his tactic of fielding only one man up front for the first time in two years.         
	When pitted against Chelseas three-man attack, with Nicolas Anelka at its centre, the two systems threatened to neutralise each other until Deco unleashed a fine drive from 25 yards, which Doni was forced to tip wide. The Portuguese playmaker was, in tandem with Frank Lampard, controlling the midfield battle, but such superiority was undermined by a toothlessness in front of goal.         
	Chelsea allowed this creeping frustration to consume them as their players scythed into Roma with the type of tackles normally reserved for gladiatorial combat. John Terry was guilty of a clear shove, Joe Cole a two-handed challenge, before Deco was finally booked for his cynical trip on Totti.         
	This error proved the most costly, gifting Roma a free-kick from which Cicinho delivered a cross straight into the path of Christian Panucci. Although Panucci did well to angle his shot beyond Petr Cech, he profited from the indecision of Terry and Alex.         
	The entry of Didier Drogba at half-time did little to arrest Chelseas slide as Vucinic wrought merry mayhem. First the 25-year-old took a short pass from Matteo Brighi and dispatched a rising shot beyond Cech. Next he capitalised on the doziness of Mikel, stealing the ball and running the length of the half, beating the retreating Nigerian once more, and finally stroking the ball calmly home.         
	Terry atoned for his earlier mistake when he latched on to Decos cross, watching the ball cannon off Donis chest and finishing at the second attempt. It represented one step forward for Chelsea, but the good work was almost instantly undone when Deco was sent off, needlessly collecting another booking for a quick free-kick. There was to be no way back.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

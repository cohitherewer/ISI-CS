  - IFA Shield Red-and-golds chances look bleak; Churchill held       A STAFF REPORTER            Jose Ramirez Barreto heads past Mohammedan Sportings V. Prem Kumar to score one of his three goals at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Picture by Gautam Bose                                 
	Calcutta: The scoreline in Saturdays floodlit encounter of the IFA Shield read Mohun Bagan beat Mohammedan Sporting 3-0. However, it would be apt to say Jose Ramirez Barreto thrashed the black-and-white outfit, marking his sixth hattrick in the process.         
	Right from the outset, the Brazilian striker dazzled and before you could wink Mohun Bagan drew first blood in the 20th second. Barreto tapped the ball home after it was chested by Isfaq Ahmed. This was the fifth fastest goal scored in Indian football.         
	Dipankar Roy scored the fastest goal in 9.33 seconds in Bengals match against Karnataka in a Santosh Trophy tie in 2000. In a first division group B match in 1996, Alamgir Akon of Eastern Coalfield scored in the 10th second against Indian Boys Athletic Club, while I.M. Vijayan had slammed home in 12th second against Bhutan in SAF Games 1999.         
	In a IFA League match in 1976, Mohammed Akbar of Mohun Bagan had scored in the 17th second, while Barreto shares the fifth place with Ernest Jeremiah. The Sporting Club de Goa striker had also scored in the 20th second in Federation Cup match against Army XI in 2006.         
	During his 66-minute stay, the Brazilian did nothing wrong. His second goal was more clinical. From a James Singh corner in the 11th minute, Douglas da Silva headed to Barreto and the latter was quick to head it home.         
	Six minutes later, Barreto completed his hattrick. Incidentally, James was again instrumental in setting up the Barreto header.         
	It feels great to bounce back after our 0-1 loss to Churchill Brothers in this tournament, Barreto said. Barreto however said he did not remember his last hattrick  in a Durand Cup match against JCT in 2002.         
	For the record, Barretos last hattrick in a match involving the Big Three was also against Mohammendan Sporting. He achieved that feat in a McDowell Cup match in 2000 which Mohun Bagan won 4-3.         
	The win also gave a lifeline to Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Periera who was much criticised especially after their loss to Churchill Brothers.         
	After Barreto was substituted by P.C. Lalawmpuia the latter had his share of chances. But Lalawmpuia was unlucky. Just minute after he made the field, he let go a chance while his left-footer hit the post in the 70th minute. Bhaichung Bhutias substitue Sewram Gobin netted one in stoppage time but only to be declared off-side.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, who are virtually out of the meet, paled in comparison. Mike Okoro and Roque Barreto got some half-hearted chances which were thwarted by the Mohun Bagan defence.

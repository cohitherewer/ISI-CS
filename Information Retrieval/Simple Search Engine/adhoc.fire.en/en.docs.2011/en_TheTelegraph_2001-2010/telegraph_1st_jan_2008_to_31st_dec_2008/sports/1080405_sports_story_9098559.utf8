The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | More trouble for Shoaib 
                                                   More trouble for Shoaib 
                      
	Karachi: Shoaib Akhtars claims about being approached by match fixers in India and South Africa may land the banned pacer in another tight spot for not reporting these instances to his team management as required by the ICC Code of Conduct. An ICC spokesman confirmed that anti-corruption officers were planning to talk to Shoaib about his claims.         
	[That the ICC Anti-Corruption Unit will talk to Shoaib was reported in Fridays Late City edition.]         
	Shoaib, in an emotional outburst during a television talk show Wednesday, alleged that some people had approached him to under-perform in Johannesburg and India but he had turned down their offer for the sake of his country.         
	I turned down these offers because I cant betray my country. Does this not show how committed and disciplined I am towards my team and country, he said.         
	The claim could land him in further trouble as the updated ICC Code of Conduct requires an active international player to report immediately any such approach/ incident to the captain, team manager, cricket board or Anti-Corruption Unit officers. The penalty could range from a one to five-year ban, plus a fine.         
	Meanwhile, a furious PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf has made it clear that he would pursue his defamation case against Shoaib to the end.

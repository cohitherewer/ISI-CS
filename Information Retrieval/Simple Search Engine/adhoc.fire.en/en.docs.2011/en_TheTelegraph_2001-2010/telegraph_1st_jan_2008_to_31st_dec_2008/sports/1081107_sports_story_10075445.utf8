            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The 32nd edition of the Federation Cup is set to be played in Calcutta and Barasat early next month.         
	According to AIFF sources, the tournament, which was scheduled to be played in Delhi and Gurgaon from December 5 to 22, is likely to be hosted by the IFA as the Delhi Soccer Association (DSA) is reluctant to stage the prestigious meet.         
	We have already written to the IFA asking them whether they are ready to hold the tournament, an official of the AIFF told The Telegraph. A final decision will be taken at the executive committee meeting on November 22.         
	If Delhi finally fails to stage the meet, Gurgaon, too, will miss the opportunity to be the co-host for the first time as a minimum of two venues are needed to play the Federation Cup under the new format.         
	A total of 16 teams  12 I-League teams and four qualifiers  will play in the Federation Cup. In the new format, 16 teams will be divided into four groups and the top two teams from each group will advance to the semi-finals.         
	Unlike last year, each team will be allowed to register only two foreign players.         
	Calcutta will be the best choice as it will be easier to telecast the matches live, the official added. Calcutta had last hosted the Federation Cup in 2006 when Mohun Bagan defeated Sporting Clube de Goa in tie-breaker in the final at the Salt Lake Stadium.

	Melbourne: Crowd trouble and police ejections cast a shadow over Melbourne Park on Tuesday, diverting attention from world-class sport at the Australian Open. 
    
	A violent incident marred a tennis fiesta in which fans bathed in glorious sunshine and the worlds best players showcased their skills. 
    
	Roger Federer revved up his bid for a 13th Grand Slam title with a slick win, Venus Williams powered through and Lleyton Hewitt turned up the heat but their exploits were tarnished by scenes at the match between Chiles Fernando Gonzalez and Greek qualifier Konstantinos Economidis. 
    
	Police said three people had been evicted from the grounds and interviewed for assaulting police, failing to obey lawful direction and indecent language. 
    
	The trouble erupted, according to eyewitnesses, when police stepped in to deal with a group of around 40 fans, who had been cheering the Greek and singing loudly between points in the match on Margaret Court Arena. 
    
	A police statement said that complaints were received after a group of fans started offensive chants during the match. 
    
	Members of the crowd had become aggressive and threatening, causing police to use pepper spray to keep them at bay. 
    
	The trouble came a year after Croatian and Serbian fans fought and traded insults at the tournament, resulting in 150 people being ejected. 
    
	Tournament directors had promised that the event would have a zero-tolerance attitude for any trouble, helped by more CCTV coverage and a significant police presence. 
    
	Earlier in the day, the Australian sun burned down on Day II but a gentle breeze had kept courtside temperatures around the mid-30s. 
    
	Third seed Novak Djokovic set the standard by swatting aside Benjamin Becker 6-0, 6-2, 7-6 and Hewitt, a former world No. 1 seeded 19th, beat Steve Darcis 6-0, 6-3, 6-0 in front of his home crowd. 
    
	In the end I felt like I could do pretty much what I wanted to do out there and play on my terms, which is good, the Australian said. 
    
	Womens fourth seed Ana Ivanovic eased past Romanias Sorana Cirstea 7-5, 6-3 and second seed Svetlana Kuznetsova swept aside Frances Nathalie Dechy 6-3, 6-1. 
    
	Frances Fabrice Santoro beat John Isner 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 in his record 62nd Grand Slam singles tournament. When 35-year-old Santoro made his Slam debut at the 1989 French Open, Isner was four years old. 
    
	Santoro faces Federer in the second round. 
    
	When Venus and Federer opened the centre court night sessions, sweaters had replaced T-shirts but the favourites continued to dominate. 
    
	Wimbledon champion Venus, seeded eighth, swept through with a 6-2, 7-5 win over Chinas Yan Zi and world No. 1 Federer made a smooth start to his bid for a fourth Australian Open title with a 6-0, 6-3, 6-0 demolition of Argentine Diego Hartfield. 
    
	The Swiss world No. 1 and defending champion showed few signs of rust in brushing aside the Argentine, breezing through the first set without losing a game and clinching victory in 74 minutes. 
    
	Im happy with my form tonight, Federer told reporters. The beginning was tough, I knew he had a good serve so it was a bit of a surprise to have such an extreme result. I didnt have any lapses mentally and played pretty tough. I served especially well and that is always important for me. 
    
	Venus survived a strong rearguard action from Yan. She led 5-2 in the second set only for the world No. 61 to level at 5-5, but the American recovered her poise to clinch victory in 74 minutes. 
    
	I felt good out there and had a lot of fun, Venus told reporters.

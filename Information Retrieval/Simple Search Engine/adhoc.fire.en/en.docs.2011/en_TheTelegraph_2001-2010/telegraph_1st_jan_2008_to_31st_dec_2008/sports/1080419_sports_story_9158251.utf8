                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chowrasia among 3 Indians to make cut
                  S.S.P. Chowrasia                     
	Beijing: Three Indians made the cut while four others missed out after the second round of the $2.2 million Volvo China Open on Friday.         
	Gaurav Ghei zoomed up the leaderboard to tied 29th after carding a three-under 69 which included five birdies and two bogeys at the Beij- ing CBD International Golf Club.         
	Ghei, who was tied 98th overnight after turning in a horrendous opening round of 76, now has an aggregate of one-over 145.         
	Gaganjeet Bhullar, tied ninth overnight, was still the highest- placed Indian at tied 23rd despite carding a three-over 75 for a par 144 total.         
	S.S.P. Chowrasia was the third to make the cut. The Indian Masters champion was tied for the 50th spot after returning a one-over 73 on Friday for a three-over 147 aggregate.         
	Shiv Kapur, who carded a second successive seven-over 79 to end up at 14 over for two rounds, is among the four who missed the cut.         
	The others are Rahil Gangjee (73), Amandeep Johl (81) and Digvijay Singh (80).         
	Frenchman Michael Lorenzo-Vera overcame blustery conditions and an attack of nerves to compile a three-under-par 69 to maintain his overnight one-stroke lead.         
	Australian Adam Groom provided the days highlight with a hole-in-one at the 199-yard, par-three third.         
	I landed a nice tee-shot there yesterday so I quite like that hole, Groom told reporters after finishing seven strokes off the pace with a two-under 70 for 143.         
	Lorenzo-Vera dropped four shots but also fired seven birdies to complete an eight-under total of 136, one ahead of Irelands Damien McGrane and Briton Richard Finch.         
	Chasing his first European Tour title, Lorenzo-Vera wrested back the lead after surrendering it to Finch with a double-bogey at the 14th, his fifth hole.         
	Finch played in calmer conditions earlier. He hit five birdies in a 69 that included a 45-foot putt at the seventh.         
	McGrane carded a bogey-free 69 that featured 10 pars in a row at the start.         
	Briton Oliver Wilson was two off the pace on 138 after birdying the last four holes for a best of the week 66.         
	Holder Markus Brier of Austria was two strokes further adrift alongside British pair Zane Scotland and Simon Griffiths and American Jason Knutzon.           (AGENCIES)

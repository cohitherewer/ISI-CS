	Brussels: Kenyan Pamela Jelimo claimed the Golden Leagues $1 million jackpot on Friday, while fellow Olympic champion Usain Bolt beat Asafa Powell to win the 100 metres at the Memorial Van Damme meeting.         
	Croatian high jumper Blanka Vlasic missed out on a share of the jackpot after finishing second behind German Ariane Friedrich, but ahead of Olympic champion and home favourite Tia Hellebaut who surprisingly finished third.         
	The 18-year-old Jelimo won the 800m in one minute 55.16 seconds, more than three seconds ahead of compatriot Janeth Jepkosgei and third-placed Kenia Sinclair of Jamaica.         
	Earlier, Bolt powered past fellow Jamaican Powell in the 100m to set a new course record time of 9.77 seconds.         
	Powell, who ran the joint second-fastest 100 of all time in Lausanne on Tuesday, finished in 9.83 after leading for most of the race until Bolt ran past him in the final 10m.         
	I am used to chasing him, Bolt told reporters after a contest Powell described as one of the most exciting ever. I was very excited about this race and knew it would be close.         
	Nesta Carter made it a Jamaican clean sweep by coming third in 10.07.         
	There was further heartbreak for Vlasic  pipped for the gold by Hellebaut at this years Beijing Games  when she failed on her final jump at 2.02m.         
	Friedrich and Hellebaut also failed clear that height but the German won on the countback in one of the biggest shocks of the night having got over 1.97 on her first jump while Vlasic needed two attempts and Hellebaut three.         
	In the womens 100m, Belgiums European champion Kim Gevaert marked her last ever appearance on home soil when she scorched to victory in 11.25 seconds.         
	Amid the loudest roar of the night from the 50,000 capacity crowd, Debbie Ferguson of the Bahamas finished second and American MeLisa Barber was third behind the tearful 30 year-old Gevaert, who will retire at the end of the year.         
	Elsewhere, Russias Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva won the pole vault with an unimpressive jump of 4.72m, blaming a combination of tiredness after Beijing and the damp weather.         
	American Jeremy Wariner overcame the wet and windy conditions to hold off Britains Martyn Rooney to win the 400m in 44.44 seconds.         
	Kenyas Paul Koech stunned Olympic and world champion Brimin Kipruto to win the 3,000m steeplechase while Kenyan Olympic silver medallist Eliud Kipchoge easily won the 5,000 in the opening race of the night.         
	World champion Tero Pitkamaki, who finished third in China, gained revenge on Norways Olympic champion Andreas Thorkildsen in the javelin, winning with a throw of 85.82m.         
	Thorkildsen finished third behind Latvias Beijing silver medallist Ainars Kovals.         
	Unlike most 18-year-old millionaires, Jelimo intends to invest wisely the $1 million jackpot she won.         
	The Kenyans victory in the 800m, combined with Vlasics failure to win in Brussels, saw Jelimo pocket the whole jackpot awarded to athletes who win their event in all six of the seasons meetings.         
	I will invest intelligently and plan carefully what to do with the money, the teenager told reporters.         
	When asked if she would have some fun with her earnings, she replied: Im going to help my family and be diligent.         
	I will use this money to help me build a long-term career and secure a future for my family, quot; she added.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wont take Bangla lightly, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wont take Bangla lightly, says Dhoni
  - Possibility of one or two Indian regulars being rested         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Karachi: Having taken to the Super Fours with the pressure-reducing two points, Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni could afford to put his feet up on Friday, a day for optional sweating.         
	There was an awards function in the morning (at the team hotel itself) and, then, Dhoni dozed off. Not for very long, though.         
	Channel surfing on getting up, a movie on cloning caught his attention and for the next hour or so, Dhoni switched off completely from captaincy and the Asia Cup.         
	Quite a luxury that in these times.         
	Of course, it was back to looking ahead once the credits began to roll on the Super Movies channel.         
	We wont be taking Bangladesh lightly (on Saturday)... Far from it... Its a good one-day team, Dhoni told The Telegraph.         
	Dhoni, however, seemed a tad concerned about the energy-sapping weather.         
	It gets very tough out in the middle... Well have to keep that in mind when finalising the XI...         
	Its to be seen who gets rested (Yuvraj Singh and Ishant Sharma didnt play the opener, versus Hong Kong), but whats confirmed is that allrounder Irfan Pathan is still unfit.         
	Hes recovering from a side strain/stiffness which surfaced either one day before the teams departure from Mumbai last Sunday or that day itself.         
	The pressure is on Bangladesh to ensure theyre not seen as merely completing numbers in the Super Four stage.         
	Bhalo khelbar cheshta korbo... The Indian team is very good, but were out to improve our cricket, is what Bangladesh captain Mohammed Ashraful said.         
	Ashraful, who got the job a year ago, remarked that while hed improved as captain, he needed to get better.         
	Incidentally, according to sources, theres utter confusion in the Bangladesh camp over the composition of the XI for the tournaments first Super Four match.         
	Unless thats quickly settled, Team Indias task is bound to get easier. Even otherwise, its not that its daunting.

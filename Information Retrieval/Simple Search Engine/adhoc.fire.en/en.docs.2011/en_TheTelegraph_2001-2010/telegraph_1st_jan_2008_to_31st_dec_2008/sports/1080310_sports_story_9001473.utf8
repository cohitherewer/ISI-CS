                                                     Chen ends Lin run
                  Chen Jin                     
	Birmingham: Hampered by a knee injury, Chinas defending champion Lin Dan failed in his bid for a fourth All-England mens singles title when he suffered a shock defeat at the hands of compatriot Chen Jin in Sundays final.         
	Chen, the world No.4, had never beaten world No.1 Lin in six previous meetings, but he completed the championship without dropping a game with a 22-20, 25-23 victory.         
	Having had three match points he finally won it on the fourth with a cross-court smash.         
	Lin suffered an injury to his left knee in training recently in Beijing, and he said: It really hurt when I got up this morning and I couldnt jump or smash properly. I did think about pulling out when he got ahead in the second, but there were a lot of spectators and I wanted to keep playing for them.         
	I am disappointed, but I am also pleased for Chen. He is a good friend and a teammate and he deserved the win today.         
	Despite the injury, the 24-year-old still hopes to play in this weeks Swiss Open Super Series in Basle. I do not play until Wednesday, so I hope the two days rest will be enough, he added.         
	Chen admitted he was very happy but was not too surprised to spring the shock. I had heard yesterday that he may had a little problem with his knee and, although Ive never beaten him in a tournament, I have beaten him in training.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Munaf wants to play for Baroda
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Munaf wants to play for Baroda
                      
	Vadodara: Munaf Patel is likely to play for Baroda during the forthcoming Ranji season, a source in the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) said on Friday.         
	Munaf, who has been playing for Maharashtra, has expressed his desire to play for Baroda, the source said.         
	Inclusion of the speedster, who recently toured Sri Lanka, would be beneficial for the Baroda team, he said, adding that pitches here support pacers. Although Irfan Pathan plays for Baroda, he would not be available if selected for the national team, the source said, adding that Patel could fill Pathans void.         
	Asked what if Patel, too, is selected in the Indian team, he said it was unlikely that both Pathan and Patel would find place in the national side.         
	The source informed that the chances of roping in international players like Andrew Flintoff, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Farvez Mahroof and Ajantha Mendis this year is highly unlikely.

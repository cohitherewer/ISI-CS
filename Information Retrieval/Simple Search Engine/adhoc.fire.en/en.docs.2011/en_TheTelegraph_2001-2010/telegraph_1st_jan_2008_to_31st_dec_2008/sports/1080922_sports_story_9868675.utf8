                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yusuf Pathan shines in India A win
                      
	Chennai: Yusuf Pathan, walking in at No.7, repaired a broken innings for India A launching an assault that included nine sixes and propelled the Indians to 305 for 8. New Zealand fell short by 81 runs and conceded a bonus point, which means they need a sizeable victory against Australia on Monday.         
	Yusuf Pathan walked in with his side at 66 for 5. Supported by Rohit Sharma and brother Irfan, Yusuf made 148 off 127 balls which made the difference between the two sides.         
	Yusuf played cleverly looking for singles at the start of his innings. But he soon began to improvise and hammered every loose ball that came his way.         
	James Marshalls 71-run partnership with Neil Broom was the only passage of play in the New Zealand innings.           (AGENCIES)

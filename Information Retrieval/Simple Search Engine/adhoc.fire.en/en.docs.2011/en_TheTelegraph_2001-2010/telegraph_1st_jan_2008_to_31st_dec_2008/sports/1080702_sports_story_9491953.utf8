            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: A 27-member Indian football squad will leave for Portugal on Wednesday night for a 12-day exposure-cum-training tour.         
	According to national coach Bob Houghton, four out of the 31 footballers, who were attending the national camp here, have been left out. They are  Sandeep Nandy, N.S. Manju, Rakesh Masih and S. Kuttamani.         
	While Kuttamani has problem with his passport, Nandy and Manju are injured, Houghton said.         
	Like last season, the Indian team will play three matches against Second Division Portugal sides.         
	In such practice matches, we will have an advantage of making any number of substitutions to have a look at all the players. This we cannot do in international friendlies, Houghton said.

	Sheikhupura: Pakistan completed a clean sweep over Zimbabwe on Saturday when they won the fifth and final one-day International by seven wickets. 
    
	Debutant pacemen Abdul Rauf and Wahab Riaz shared five wickets to dismiss Zimbabwe for 181 in 45.4 overs after they had elected to bat first. 
    
	Opener Khurrum Manzoor, also making his debut, scored a fluent 50 and put on 97 runs from 100 balls with Younis Khan (63) to seal victory with 19 overs to spare. 
    
	Younis played in an attacking mode to enthral the full house at the stadium which has not hosted an international game for nine years. 
    
	Price also bowled Manzoor in the next over after he had reached his half-century. Manzoor, who hit six fours in his 74-ball innings, was bowled off-stump trying to sweep Price. 
    
	Manzoor and opener Nasir Jamshed gave a quick start of 40 to their team in 6.1 overs before the latter was out for 19 trying to hit Chigumbura out of the ground and holing out to Keith Dabengwa at long on. 
    
	Misbah-ul Haq (31 not out) and Fawad Alam (14 not out) sealed the match in the 31st over with a flourish. Misbah hitting a big six off Dabengwa.

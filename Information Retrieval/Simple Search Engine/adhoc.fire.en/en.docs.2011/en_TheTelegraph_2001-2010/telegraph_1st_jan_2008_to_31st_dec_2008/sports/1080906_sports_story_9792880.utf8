The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Capello needs a team player
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Capello needs a team player
            MARTIN SAMUEL                      
	Presented with the challenge of keeping Luka Modric quiet at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, Luiz Felipe Scolari, the Chelsea manager, knew what to do: he moved his third-choice right back into his space.         
	Juliano Belletti, late of Barcelona reserves and behind Jose Bosingwa and Paulo Ferreira in the Chelsea pecking order, was detailed with the task of playing the holding midfield role and snuffed Modric out of the game. He had not played in that position for many seasons and was drafted in only as a result of injuries, but he did it very well.         
	In comparison to goal scoring or creation, even when set against Bellettis most typical duty, which may involve keeping Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo in check, holding midfield is a straightforward discipline.         
	It requires intelligence, yes, but not a leap of imagination and invention. Bottom line, it demands self-control, restraint, the nose to sense danger and the coolness to cope. These are basic skills for a professional footballer.         
	Most of all it necessitates self-sacrifice, the willingness to put the team above personal glory. It says something about English egos, not just English tactical awareness, that so many have struggled to make it work.         
	England have half a dozen central midfield players who like to get forward and play box to box. Tough. There is not room for them all.         
	So some are discarded and some are on the bench and one has to play a different game. He has to be Javier Mascherano for the day, or Claude Makelele, or Marcos Senna, or Dunga, or Didier Deschamps, or any one of those marvellous foreign players who do the easy job so well that it becomes almost an art form.         
	All of those are, or were, fine footballers. Every one could have carried out a more demanding role for the team. Their greatest talent was unselfishness.         
	For Capello, the problem is that the match against Andorra Saturday provides little preparation for the visit to Zagreb next week. In the first match Englands midfield could get away with a cavalier approach as the opposition concentrate on massed defence and, from previous experience, foul play.         
	Against Croatia it will require discipline and restraint to shut out Modric and, again, experience has foretold the consequence if that does not happen.

                                                     Dwain: Dont treat me like a leper
    - I want to get on with my life           Charlie Caroe               Dwain Chambers                                 
	Dwain Chambers has spoken out over his controversial selection for the British team competing at next months World Indoor Championships in Valencia.         
	The sprinter, who tested positive in 2004 for the designer drug THG, the substance at the centre of the Balco doping scandal in the US, had earned his qualification when he competed in, and won, the 60m at last weekends trials.         
	Chambers, 29, told a paper on Tuesday: Im being made to feel like a leper. A terrible stigma has been attached to me but people need to know I am clean.         
	Yes, I did something wrong. I did the crime  but Ive done my time and now Ive moved on.         
	Every morning I wake up knowing I have not fulfilled my potential  and thats all Im trying to do now. I believe I have two more years ahead of me.         
	Other people are allowed to get on with their lives once they have served a punishment  so why cant I get on with mine?         
	UK Athletics have even taken the unprecedented step of announcing that they selected the Belgrave Harriers athlete despite being unanimous in its desire not to select Dwain.         
	Chambers is aware that many people are against his participation in the sport after a he was not subject to testing during all of 2007 when he unsuccessfully sought a career in American football, but feels he should be given a chance.         
	He said: At the moment, I am doing everything on my own. I am training from a local park, without a coach. Imagine what I could do if I was back on the tracks, with a proper trainer and support.         
	I respect that people have opinion about me and they are entitled to those. Im not going to get into a slanging match with them.         
	But they should remember Im only doing what Im legally entitled to do. If the law forbade me from running, I wouldnt be doing it.         
	I have a lot to prove but all I want to do is let my legs do the talking.         
	UK Athletics had wanted to prevent the former drugs cheat from competing in last weekends trials because he has not been regularly dope tested by them since 2006 after trying to break into the NFL last year, but they were overruled by the IAAF.         
	Chambers duly won the 60m sprint in emphatic style, a victory that earned automatic selection as long as UK Athletics did not use an extraordinary circumstances clause to omit the 29-year-old.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

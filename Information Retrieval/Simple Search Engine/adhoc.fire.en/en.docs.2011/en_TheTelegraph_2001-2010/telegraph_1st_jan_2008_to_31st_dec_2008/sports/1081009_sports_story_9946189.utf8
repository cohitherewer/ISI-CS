            A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: Chris Broad, the Match Referee for the India versus Australia Test series which starts on Thursday, spoke to the representatives of the two teams on Wednesday and told them to avoid making inappropriate public comments.         
	Broad added that any such comments could result in a code of conduct charge being laid against the individual responsible.         
	Broad spoke to the two captains, coaches and the others involved in team management.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said: The whole world has been waiting for this series with great expectations and we all want it to be remembered for all the right reasons, because of great cricket.         
	There has been a long build-up to the series but now it is time for the cricket on the field to do the talking as a demonstration that Test cricket remains the pinnacle of our great game.

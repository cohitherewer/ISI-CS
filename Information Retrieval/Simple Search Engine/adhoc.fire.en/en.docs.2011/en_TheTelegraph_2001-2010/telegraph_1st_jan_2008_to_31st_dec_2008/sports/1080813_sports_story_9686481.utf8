                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chelsea release Branislav
            iN amp; OUT                
	 Chelsea are preparing to cut their losses and sell Branislav Ivanovic to AC Milan. The Serbia defender was signed for 9.7m from Lokomotiv Moscow in January, but is yet to play for the first team.         
	Villa purchase         
	 Aston Villa have agreed a fee with Rangers for Carlos Cuellar, the Spanish defender. The 26-year-old will discuss terms with Villa, whose bid has triggered a release clause in Cuellars contract. Rangers confirmed on Monday that they had accepted a bid of 7.8m.         
	Pizarro fate         
	 Claudio Pizarro could also be leaving Stamford Bridge. Hull City and Stoke City are interested in the Peru forward, who scored only twice last season. Its a very expensive option, Phil Brown, the Hull manager, said.         
	Smith in demand         
	 Evertons hopes of signing Alan Smith from Newcastle United hung in the balance Monday night. The Merseyside club are willing to pay about 2m for Smith.         
	Kaboul move         
	Younes Kaboul has completed his 6m transfer from Tottenham Hotspur to Portsmouth and has signed a four-year contract. Everyone in the papers was saying I was going to Sunderland or Aston Villa, but I only ever wanted to come here, the 22-year-old defender said.

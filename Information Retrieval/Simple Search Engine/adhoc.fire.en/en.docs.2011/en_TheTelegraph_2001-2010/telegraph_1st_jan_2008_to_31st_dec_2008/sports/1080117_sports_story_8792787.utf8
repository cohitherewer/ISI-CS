	Mumbai: Opener Tanmay Srivastava cracked a brilliant hundred while Ravikant Shukla remained unbeaten with a determined 80 as Uttar Pradesh scored 292 for seven on Day I of the five-day Ranji Trophy final against Delhi on Wednesday. 
    
	After being put in to bat, UP struggled initially but were propped up by a superb knock of 105 by Tanmay. The left-hander struck 13 boundaries and a six in his 174-ball essay adding an invaluable 101 runs for the fourth wicket with Shukla, who batted sensibly to remain unconquered at stumps with Bhuvanesh Kumar (6). 
    
	Tanmay and Shuklas judicious approach helped UP make light of the cheap dismissals of skipper Mohammed Kaif (16) and Suresh Raina (16) before lunch. 
    
	Shukla however, was let off by wicketkeeper Puneet Bisht off Sumit Narwal at 57. Narwal and left-arm pacer Pradeep Sangwan captured three wickets each. 
    
	Earlier, in the morning, UP started on a shaky note when another opener Rohit Srivastava was trapped lbw by Narwal who used the conditions well to move the ball either way. And at the score of 60, Raina was caught on the wrong foot off Sangwan.

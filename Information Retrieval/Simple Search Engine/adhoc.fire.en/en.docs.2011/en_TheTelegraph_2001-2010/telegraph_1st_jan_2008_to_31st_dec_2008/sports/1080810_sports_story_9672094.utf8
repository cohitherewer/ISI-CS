	Petaling Jaya (Malaysia): Gaurav Ghei turned in his best card of the week, a brilliant five-under 67 to finish on an impressive tied fourth position in the $310,000 Worldwide Selangor Masters on Saturday.         
	Overnight tied 18th, Ghei ended his campaign with an overall fourround total of fiveunder 279.         
	The Delhi golfer was off the block, firing as many as three birdies in the second, fifth and sixth hole in the front nine, but a bogey in the ninth saw him take the turn at two-under.         
	On resumption, Ghei sank a birdie in the 11th and bettered it by picking up an eagle in the 13th but he stumbled in the 15th and dropped a bogey.         
	His compatriot Amandeep Johl (289) carded a nightmarish sixover 77 to finish 43rd.           (PTI)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: India crashed out of the Asian under-16 football championships in Tashkent on Monday when they went down to Syria 3-0.         
	While Asaad Al Khadr put Syria ahead in the first half, two own goals by Deepak Devrani and Ashish Chhetri in a span of six minutes in the second session completely dashed Indias hopes. With two back to back defeats, India are now out of contention for a place in the quarter finals.

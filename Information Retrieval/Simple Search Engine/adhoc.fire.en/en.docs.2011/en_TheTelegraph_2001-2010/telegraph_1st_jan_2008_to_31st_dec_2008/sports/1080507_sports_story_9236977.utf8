The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rusty Shoaib gets down to business
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rusty Shoaib gets down to business
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The prolonged break from cricket may have robbed him of match fitness but maverick Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar showed why he is such a crowd puller.         
	The temperamental Pakistan quick joined the Kolkata Knight Riders practice session at the Eden on Tuesday, demonstrating to the hilt why Sourav Ganguly feels Shoaibs inclusion can mark a turnaround in the fortunes of his beleaguered side.         
	In the three-and-half hours that he was in the field, the latest entrant to the Knight Riders family absolutely monopolised all attention.         
	Shoaib, who reached the city on Monday night after the five-year ban slapped on him by the Pakistan Cricket Board was suspended for a month by an appellate tribunal, was very rusty to begin with.         
	He started off with two wide-balls but soon settled down to a nice rhythm. Coach John Buchanan had split the squad into two for a practice match that lasted three hours and Shoaib sent a couple each in both innings.         
	Even if captain Sourav wants him in the side, the Knight Riders coach had made it clear last Sunday itself that the fast bowler would not be considered for selection before the Indian Premier League tie versus Deccan Chargers.         
	That position remained unchanged on Tuesday. The fast bowler has not yet been certified fit by physio Andrew Leipus.         
	In the fourth ball of his very first over, the Rawalpindi Express almost cleaned up David Hussey who somehow ducked a vicious bouncer. The lights at the Eden had still not illuminated fully and Sourav, sitting on the sidelines, was heard quipping, turn on the lights else the blokes a gonner!         
	But two overs were all that Shoaib could deliver. He took the help of an inhaler soon after and was banished to the sidelines where he had little else to do except reach out for a drink every two minutes.         
	In between, however, he effected a brilliant run out but balanced that with a dropped high catch.         
	The practice tie saw Sourav and his men take turns with the bat with the captain looking in blistering form.         
	He chose Murali Kartik for special attention and one straight drive off his bat stung the left-arm spinner so hard that he had to tape his left palm afterwards.         
	Team officials, however, confirmed that it was just a precautionary measure.         
	Shoaib, meanwhile, sent down couple more overs in innings No.2 and produced two edges which flew between the keeper and first slip.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Golfers face the sack for poor English 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Golfers face the sack for poor English 
            GILES MOLE            Korean golfer Se Ri Pak                           
	The leading tour in womens golf is believed to be the first in professional sport to introduce an examination in spoken English for its members.         
	The LPGA currently has 121 players from 26 different countries, and of them, 45 are from South Korea, where womens golf is becoming increasingly popular.         
	Previously, the likes of Annika Sorenstam and Lorena Ochoa had been the dominant forces in womens golf, but non-English speaking Korean players are now regularly winning events, boosting the sports popularity in the Far East.         
	However, reports suggest this trend is damaging the commercial appeal in the US, where the tour is based, and the LPGAs deputy commissioner, Libba Galloway, said: For an athlete to be successful in the sports entertainment world we live in, they need to be great performers on and off the course, and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this.         
	Being a US-based tour, and with the majority of our fan base, pro-am contestants, sponsors and participants being English speaking, we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in English.         
	Korean golfer Se Ri Pak admits speaking English is a necessity but feels suspension is too harsh a punishment.         
	She said: We agree we should speak some English. When you win you should give your speech in English.         
	Mostly what comes out is nerves. Totally different language in front of camera. Youre excited and not thinking in English, she said.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

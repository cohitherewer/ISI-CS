	Calcutta: Al Wihdat will go all out for a win against East Bengal after their shock defeat in the AFC Cup back home. The red-and gold outfit won 2-0 in Amman and are currently the leaders in group B with six points.         
	The 10-time Jordan league champions are languishing at the bottom of the table with only two points in their kitty. The visitors have to win their return leg match on Wednesday to stay afloat in the competition.         
	Their Egyptian coach Mohammed Omar is yet to get over the shock defeat against Aloke Mukherjees boys.         
	I would let people know that we played a tremendous game. There were slip-ups and unfortunately our opponents cashed in on those mistakes. We would like to make amends this time around and will go all out for a win, Omar said on Monday through an interpreter.         
	They practised at the East Bengal ground in the afternoon. The heat and humidity, though, has already left them worried. A 3pm kick-off is sure to add to their problems.         
	Its terribly hot out here, Omar said.         
	The visitors are without their main striker Mahmoud Shelbaieh, who has been forced to stay back with a hamstring injury. A lot will depend on their Egyptian striker Yousuf Mustafa. The other foreigners in their squad are Ivory Coast midfielder Bamba Ramane and Iraqi defender Haidar Abdul-Jabar.

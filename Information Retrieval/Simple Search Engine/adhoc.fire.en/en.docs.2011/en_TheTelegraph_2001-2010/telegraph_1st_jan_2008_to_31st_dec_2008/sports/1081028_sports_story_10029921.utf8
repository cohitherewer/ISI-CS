The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fleming sees a McGrath in Ishant 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fleming sees a McGrath in Ishant 
                      
	Melbourne: Ishant Sharma continues to win admirers with the latest being former Australian pacer Damien Fleming, who even went to the extent of comparing the lanky Delhi youngster with legendary Glenn McGrath.         
	Fleming believes that Ishant has it in him to join the 500 Test-wicket club, provided he stays away from injuries.         
	Ishant, who has 34 wickets from 11 Tests at an average of 31.17, has troubled the Australian batsmen right from Indias tour Down Under earlier this year to the ongoing four-Test series.         
	Fleming said Ishant has all the hallmarks of McGrath. He ticked off a lot of things that I loved in Glenn McGrath. He is tall; he also has a solid action, so he maximises his bounce. He is swinging the new ball a bit, he is swinging the old ball a lot and he also has a good change of pace now. He has got one of the best slower balls going around, Fleming said.         
	He didnt have that 18 months ago. What that says to me is this kid has some great physical attributes, but he has obviously got some great mental attributes as well, he was quoted as saying in an Australian daily. Fleming feels Ishant, 20, is definitely a material for the elite 500 Test wicket club.

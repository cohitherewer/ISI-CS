The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia 131/6
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Australia 131/6
                      
	Brisbane: Simon Katich (67 n.o.) stood between New Zealand and a gettable fourth-innings chase at the Gabba, where 16 wickets tumbled on an eventful second day.         
	After taking a first innings lead of 58 runs, Australia found themselves in trouble as New Zealand pacemen Chris Martin (3/52) and Ian Brien (2/23) demolished their top order to reduce them to 131 for six in the second innings at close of second days play, according to cricinfo.         
	The hosts now have an overall lead of 189 runs.         
	Earlier, having dismissed Australia for 214 in the first innings, New Zealand batsmen failed to complement the bowlers and were blown away by a pumped up Aussie pace attack.         
	Brett Lee, Stuart Clark and Shane Watson took two wickets each while Johnson bowled a fiery line to wreck the lower order. New Zealand started their first innings on a disappointing note as they were reduced to 44/2. But Ross Taylor (40), Daniel Flynn (39 not out) and Jesse Ryder (30) tried to steady the innings before the collapse.

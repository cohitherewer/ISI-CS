                                                   Force India to groom drivers

           
	New Delhi: Force India will set about unearthing home grown Michael Schumachers and Lewis Hamiltons with a new driver programme. The first step has been taken with the Motorsports Association of India (MAI) collaborated with continental motor sports bodies to form the Autosport Academy Asia in Johor Baru, Malaysia. 
    
	While it will be MAIs job to identify budding drivers, Force India will groom them for the big league of Formula One. 
    
	MAI will identify deserving young Indian drivers who will be supported by Force India to undergo a driver training course at the academy, Vijay Mallya, chairman and managing director of the Formula One team said. 
    
	Drivers who show exceptional abilities will then be further supported by Force India to race in selected European championships, said Mallya, who is also MAI chairman. 
    
	When Mallya took over Spyker and renamed it Force India, many expected to see an Indian driver  either Narain Karthikeyan or Karun Chandhok  behind the wheels. 
    
	But while Karthikeyan veered to A1 GP, Chandhok felt he needed another season in the GP2 Series before taking the F1 plunge. 
    
	Force India unveiled an impressive driving line-up comprising Giancarlo Fisichella, Adrian Sutil and Vitantonio Liuzzi (test driver). Mallya said the idea behind the new programme was to produce Indian F1 drivers. 
    
	The principal objective is to identify, train and eventually prepare an Indian driver for the Force India F1 team to compete in the FIA Formula One World Championship, he said. The academy in Malaysia will be affiliated to the French motor sport federation, which runs a driver training programme in Formula Campus single-seater racing cars at their facility in Le Mans. 
    
	The Asian academy will have two driver courses that will appraise the youngsters to see if they are good enough for F1. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No entry fee for Masters
                                                No entry fee for Masters
            January 26 Digest                      
	New Delhi: In a bid to make the forthcoming Indian Masters a hit, the organisers have waived off entry fee for the event to be held at the Delhi Golf Club from February 7-10.         
	The $ 2.5 million tournament, the first European Tour event to be staged in India, has attracted a strong field which will see Ernie Els, Thomas Bjorn, Mark Meara, Darrren Clarke and David Howell among others vying for honours in the company of top Indian players, led by Jeev Milkha Singh.           
	Sydney repercussion  
	Melbourne: The image crisis that has hit the Australians post-Sydney furore may jeopardise their chances of playing in the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL) as the BCCI-backed tourneys franchise owners are not too keen on signing them due to a dramatic decline in their popularity in India.         
	Mike Hussey, Michael Clarke, Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Andrew Symonds have all signed for the lucrative league.           
	Uthappa confident  
	Mumbai: Indian batsman Robin Uthappa said he would not hesitate in giving it back to the Australians if they try to rattle him by sledging in the upcoming tri-series Down Under.

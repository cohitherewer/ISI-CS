The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bahrain suits us, say Force India drivers
                                                     Bahrain suits us, say Force India drivers
                  Fisichella                     
	New Delhi: The Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir has Force India drivers Giancarlo Fisichella and Adrian Sutil licking their lips in anticipation of a strong Sunday finish on a track that, they claim, suits them to a tee.         
	Sutil, after failing to finish the seasons first two races, in Melbourne and Sepang, hopes to master the gently undulating 5.412km track that combines long straights with tight, narrow corners and post his first finish of the season.         
	In Bahrain, you need to be quite quick in a straight line, and the teams will be quite close together, but I think with the new upgrades we have we will be much closer than ever to the other teams, a buoyant Sutil said.         
	Its mainly a hairpin circuit, a few quick chicanes but mainly second gear corners, so it should suit us a bit better, said the German.         
	On Force Indias prospects, Sutil said, I think we will be close to reaching second qualifying again. We saw in both Melbourne and Malaysia that Giancarlo was close, and it will be similar again, I hope.         
	I feel Ive been unlucky in qualifying, and then of course in the race, but I am confident that we wont have the same problem again, he said.         
	Fisichella was no less impressed by the track. I enjoy the Bahrain Grand Prix. It is a good track with a long straight that can be very enjoyable if you have a good engine. There are, of course, a couple of tricky corners and it is very demanding on the brakes, so it proves to be a good challenge, he said.         
	Though the team has proved that its not there just to make up numbers, Fisichella predicted it would be a neck-and-neck race. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England off to a sound start
                                                                                                                                                                                                       England off to a sound start

	London: Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook shared a sprightly unbeaten opening partnership to swing the first Test in Englands favour against New Zealand at Lords on Friday.         
	When bad light stopped play for the fifth and final time on the second day, the pair had taken their side to 68 without loss in reply to New Zealands 277.         
	Cook showed a particularly good touch to reach 43 while Strauss was on 24. The two left-handers put on 30 in five overs after tea and kept the scoreboard moving with a series of sharp singles.         
	Earlier, Ryan Sidebottom, who failed to take a wicket on Thursday, recaptured his line and length from the Pavilion End, moving the ball late into the right-handers to take four for five from 10.1 overs and four for 55 for the innings. His last three victims were all clean bowled.         
	I was bitterly disappointed with my performance yesterday, Sidebottom said. I felt New Zealand got 50 runs too many in hindsight.         
	New Zealand were determined to consolidate after Brendon McCullums run-a-ball 97 pulled them back from the brink on Thursday.         
	Resuming at 208 for six they added just 52 in the morning session with captain Daniel Vettori hitting the only two boundaries.           (REUTERS)

	Calcutta: East Bengal will play against a North 24 Parganas outfit to mark the inauguration of the Vivekananda Krirangan at Khardah on Monday. Former chief minister Jyoti Basu inaugurated the stadium on Sunday.         
	Coach Aloke Mukherjee, however, wants to use the match as East Bengals preparation ahead of their home match against Jordan champions Al Wihdat in the AFC Cup.         
	East Bengal beat the Jordanian outfit 2-0 in Amman.         
	The players have done the nation proud by beating Jordan champions Al Wihdat. The responsibility now lies with them to ensure a quarter final berth, Aloke said.         
	Meanwhile, the club officials have met number of players, including Alvito DCunha, to discuss next years plans. Alvito remained tight-lipped on the issue.

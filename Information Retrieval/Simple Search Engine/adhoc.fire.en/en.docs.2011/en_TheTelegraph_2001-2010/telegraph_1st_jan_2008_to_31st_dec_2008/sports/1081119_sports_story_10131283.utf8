The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky in no mood to forgive Ian, Border
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ricky in no mood to forgive Ian, Border
                      
	Melbourne: Ricky Ponting said he was in no mood to break the ice with former captains Ian Chappell and Allan Border as he was deeply hurt by their criticism regarding the over-rate controversy during the Nagpur Test.         
	Among the barrage of criticism over the Australian captains decision to use part-time bowlers instead of the frontliners to speed up the teams slow over-rate, Ponting was cut deepest by the comments from Chappell and Border.         
	I havent spoken to either of those two gentlemen and probably wont for a while, Ponting said at a pre-Test luncheon in Brisbane.         
	I dont mind anyone questioning my tactics but the thing that worried me most over this whole issue was that everybody seemed to be saying I was putting myself ahead of the team. I thought that was a bit unfair because anyone who knows me would say otherwise, he was quoted as saying by a television channel.         
	Border, however, strongly denied having said that the skipper had put himself ahead of the team.         
	I dont know where he (Ponting) is getting his information from, Border was quoted as saying by an Australian cricket magazine.         
	We never really talked about it being a personal decision, we were just in commentary and we disagreed with the tactics that were being employed. It was as plain and simple as that.         
	There was never any inference about Ricky Ponting making those decisions on a personal level.

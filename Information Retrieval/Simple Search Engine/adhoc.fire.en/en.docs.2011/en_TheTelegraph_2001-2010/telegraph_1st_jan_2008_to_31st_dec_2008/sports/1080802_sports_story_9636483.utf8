    - AFC CHALLENGE CUP
  -  Win must against Turkmenistan for semi-final berth                   Bhaichung Bhutia celebrates Indias goal against Tajikistan during their AFC Challenge Cup match in Hyderabad on Friday. (Reuters)                           
	Hyderabad: Talismanic Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia induced an own goal from Tajikistan as the hosts salvaged a 1-1 draw against the defending champions in their second Group a match of the AFC Challenge Cup football tournament on Friday.         
	Barely a minute after entering the field as second half substitute for off-colour Sushil Kumar Singh, Bhaichung was instrumental in the equaliser that came in the 61st minute after Yusuf Rabiev had put Tajikistan ahead in the 11th minute at the Gachibowli stadium.         
	Another second half substitute Surkumar Singh began the goal-bound move by feeding Steven Dias who, in turn, sent a curling cross from the right for the Indian captain to make a desperate lunge sending the ball in after a deflection from the Tajik goalkeeper Alisher Tuychiev for an own goal.         
	With four points from two matches, India will have to win their final group match against Turkmenistan on Sunday for a semi-final berth in the eight-nation tournament, the winner of which will qualify for the 2011 Asian Cup.         
	India, who began without four key players in the starting line up, were far from impressive with the physically stronger and faster Tajiks dictating terms in the first half.         
	With India coach Bob Houghton keeping the senior players on bench in view of the tight schedule, the inexperienced lot seemed nervous which showed in the mis-passes galore and lack of direction and purpose.         
	The Tajiks sent a flurry of goal-bound curling crosses mainly from the right and the Indian defenders had a torrid time in the first half.         
	In the sixth minute itself, an error by goalkeeper Subrata Paul handed Tajik striker Davrondzhon Tukhtasunov a golden chance but Clifford Miranda was in time to clear it out of harms way.         
	Earlier, the shaky Indian defence could not stop the Central Asians from taking the lead in the 11th minute.         
	Davronjon Ergashev fed striker Tukhtasunov down the right edge of the box and the latters low cross was blasted into the empty net by Yusuf Rabiev with the ball going in after hitting the crossbar.         
	India, however, nearly equalised in the 22nd minute with Steven Dias. Sensing the rival goalkeeper out of position, Dias sent a long aerial pass for Sunil Chhetri whose header beat the goalkeeper but missed the target by inches.         
	Down 0-1 at the breather, Houghton brought in Surkumar Singh in place of Mahesh Gawli and Bhaichung came in place of Sushil and the move paid off immediately.         
	Bhaichung made a desperate lunge for a header off a Steven Dias cross and the Indian captains effort blocked the sight of Tajik goalkeeper Alisher Tuychiev who let the ball in after it hit his palm.         
	Spurred by the equaliser and cheered by a sparse home crowd, the Indians seemed to have found their feet but the Tajiks were not the ones to remain quiet and they mounted a couple of offensives.         
	India had close shaves from conceding the lead again at least on two occasions.         
	In the 68th minute, Subrata Paul blocked a shot from close angle by Yusuf Rabiev.         
	In the 80th minute, Gouramangi Singh had to make a last minute goal-line clearance off a shot by Numondzhon Khakimov and eight minutes from time, Khakimov hit the left upright from a close angle to a sigh of relief from the home supporters.

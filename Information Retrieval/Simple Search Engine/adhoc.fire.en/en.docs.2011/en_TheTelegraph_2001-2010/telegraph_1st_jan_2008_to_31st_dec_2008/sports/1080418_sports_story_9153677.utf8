The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Amazing spectacle from start to finish on cards
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Amazing spectacle from start to finish on cards
  - We have the makings of a team that will vie for a top four spot
                          Mind Games     John Buchanan    
	Since I first heard of this concept, the IPL and its proposed delivery, to the time when we are only a day away from the inaugural game, my excitement continues to grow.         
	Twenty20 cricket is still new in format as well as acceptance. The franchising of teams is a novel idea, especially the resources that have been ploughed into the eight franchises here in India. And the city-based approach to teams as opposed to countries or regional provinces is something foreign to cricket.         
	Mix a dash of industrialist power, some media might, and the entertainment of Bollywood and we have an incredible product which, if managed correctly by the administrators of world cricket, has the capacity to take the game to all parts of the world.         
	In fact, my picture of the IPL is that within three-five years, there will be about eight-ten zones around the world with about 10 franchises in each. In a window like April-May or September-October, all zonal play-offs will be completed, allowing the winners to play in the World Series.         
	It may be under a roofed stadium in Dubai, Telstra Dome in Australia or the US, India, or wherever there is the capacity to guarantee TV, media, sponsors, spectators and players a final series to crown the champions of the world.         
	For now, though, my concerns are with the Kolkata Knight Riders franchise. From behind the scenes we can see there has been a lot done in a very short time; but there remains a mountain to climb yet. One of these is to bring this diverse group of players together and create a unit which will play consistently well and would therefore be hard to beat.         
	With Sourav Ganguly as the captain, we have Ricky Ponting, David Hussey, Brendon McCullum, Chris Gayle, Ishant Sharma, Umar Gul, Murali Kartik, Mohammed Hafeez, Tatenda Taibu, Ajit Agarkar and Salman Butt  a very talented assortment of players, albeit with not too much Twenty20 experience.         
	Once we add to this some of the local boys in Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Ashok Dinda, Wriddhiman Saha, Rohan Banerjee, Debabrata Das, Sourasish Lahiri and Ranadeb Bose, some other very good players such as Aakash Chopra, Cheteswar Pujara, Yashpal Singh, and some youth in the shape of Iqbal Abdullah and Siddarth Kaul  we have the makings of a team that will challenge for a top-four spot at the end of the season.         
	The first week has gone well with the gradual arrivals of Agarkar, Sourav, Ishant and Hafeez. Obviously the loss of Shoaib Akhtar is something outside our control and we are monitoring his case with the PCB closely.         
	Competition for the first squad picked for the match against Bangalore on Friday and the first home game against Hyderabad on Sunday was fierce.         
	We have opted for a side with a formidable top-five batting component and a bowling attack that has the pace of Ishant and Dinda, the variety of Agarkar, Shukla and Sourav, plus a very good balance of spin with Kartik, Hussey and Hafeez.         
	As for the opposition, Bangalore Royal Challengers are an allround team with few standout players but the possible danger men are Zaheer Khan, Mark Boucher, Cameron White, Abdul Razzak and Misbah-ul Haq.         
	Looking ahead to the Deccan Chargers, they must be one of the favourites with Adam Gilchrist, Andrew Symonds, Herschelle Gibbs, Shahid Afridi, Rohit Sharma, RP Singh and Chaminda Vaas plus a strong bench in their ranks. Of course, like all teams, they can only select four international players but they have a depth of talent to cover their final XI.         
	In just over five weeks we will know which teams have understood Twenty20 best; which teams have had the depth necessary to win tournaments and overall how successful the inaugural IPL has been.         
	I have little doubt that what we are all about to view will be an amazing spectacle from the start to finish.           GAMEPLAN

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis Hamilton penalty worst judgement, says Niki Lauda
                                                                                                                                                                                           Lewis Hamilton penalty worst judgement, says Niki Lauda
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                  Lewis Hamilton      
	Former Formula One champion Niki Lauda has described the 25-second penalty that deprived Lewis Hamilton of victory in the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday as the worst judgement in the history of F1.         
	Briton Hamilton took the chequered flag at Spa-Franorchamps after a thrilling wheel-to-wheel battle with Ferraris defending world champion Kimi Raikkonen.         
	But he was retrospectively relegated to third for allegedly gaining an advantage by cutting out the Bus Stop chicane during his duel with Raikkonen in teeming rain in the closing laps.         
	The decision gave Raikkonens Brazilian team-mate Felipe Massa his fifth win of the season.         
	Lauda said: This is the worst judgement in the history of F1. The most perverted judgement I have ever seen. Its absolutely unacceptable when three functionaries (the stewards) influence the championship like this.         
	McLaren have lodged an appeal against the punishment for the incident, which Hamilton insisted gave him no advantage.         
	I was ahead going into that corner, so I didnt gain an advantage from it, Hamilton said at a news conference before the penalty was announced. We were still able to race at the next corner and I gave him his spot back, and I think it was fair and square.         
	A McLaren spokesman said that their appeal would rest on the fact that Hamilton had moved aside to allow Raikonnen to regain position before racing resumed.         
	Having passed the lead back to Kimi, Lewis repositioned, moving his car across and behind Kimi to the right-hand line. He then outbraked him into the hairpin. Hamiltons lead over Massa in the drivers standings now stands at two points with five races remaining as the Briton seeks his first world championship.         
	Team chief Ron Dennis said: That was a sensational Grand Prix, which kept everyone on the edge of their seats, whoever they were supporting.         
	On the second lap, Lewis made a rare mistake, dropping him to second place behind Kimi Raikkonen, who he put under considerable pressure thereafter.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pakistans triumph over India in the just-concluded tri-series in Bangladesh saw them close the gap by two rating points with Mahendra Singh Dhonis side in the latest ICC ODI rankings, according to a media release.         
	The 25-run victory over India in the final of the tri-series in Dhaka on Saturday, however, was not enough to propel Shoaib Maliks men from the fifth spot.         
	It seriously dented Indias chances of leapfrogging to the third spot toppling New Zealand. A win against Pakistan last night would have propelled India two points ahead of Daniel Vettoris side.         
	Among batsmen, Pakistans Salman Butt and India opener Gautam Gambhir achieved career-high rankings during the Dhaka tri-series. While Butt jumped seven places to 16th, Gambhir moved to the 20th spot.

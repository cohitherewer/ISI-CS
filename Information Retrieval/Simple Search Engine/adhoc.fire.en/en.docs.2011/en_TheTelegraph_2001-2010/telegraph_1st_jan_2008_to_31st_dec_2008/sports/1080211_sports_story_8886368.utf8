The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bryans take US into quarters
                                                Bryans take US into quarters
                      
	London: The Bryan brothers produced a ruthless doubles master class on Saturday to propel Davis Cup holders United States into a quarter final showdown with France.         
	Twins Bob and Mike Bryan did not seem to be troubled by the hastily laid indoor clay court, which teammate Andy Roddick had lambasted as terrible, and dispatched Austrias Juergen Melzer and Julian Knowle in just 89 minutes.         
	The world No. 1s lived up to their billing as they outclassed the Austrian duo 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 to give the Americans an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the World Group first-round tie.         
	France also wrapped up their tie against Romania in the Transylvanian town of Sibiu with a day to spare.         
	Argentina, the Czech Republic and Spain also booked their places in the last eight by opening up 3-0 leads but must wait another 24 hours to discover the identity. (Reuters)

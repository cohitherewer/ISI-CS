The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PPP support for Shoaib
                                                   PPP support for Shoaib
                      
	Lahore: The ruling Pakistan Peoples Party Thursday dubbed as unjustified the five-year ban on fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar and accused the countrys cricket board chief of victimising him to settle personal scores. The ban is unjustified and will finish Shoaibs career, said Chaudhary Munawar Anjum, spokesman of PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari said in a statement here.         
	He alleged the bowler was victimised by the chairman (Nasim Ashraf) of the PCB on the basis of his personal disliking for Shoaib. Through this unjustified severe punishment, the chairman, PCB, has tried to set personal scores with Shoaib, Anjum was quoted by official news agency PPP as saying. It is like ending Shoaibs career prematurely without a valid reason.         
	Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan, termed Shoaib Akhtars five-year ban as harsh and demanded the new government to disband the current board and appoint a new set-up on more democratic lines.         
	Meanwhile, Shoaib said he would have to delay joining the IPL, as he wanted to personally be present on all the appeal hearings to defend himself. He also wants to attend the special hearing of the Pakistan senate standing committee on sports.

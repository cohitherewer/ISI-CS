	London: Kevin Pietersen scored a belligerent century on Thursday to put England firmly in control of the first Test against South Africa after the opening day at Lords.         
	After being sent in to bat, England finished on 309 for three wickets after a wobble midway through the afternoon session.         
	Pietersen, who was felled by a bouncer from Dale Steyn at the start of his innings, powered his way to 104 not out in his first Test against the country of his birth.         
	Ian Bell, with whom Pietersen has added 192 runs for the fourth wicket, will resume on Friday on 75.         
	Pietersen has a phenomenal record against South Africa. When he made his debut for the England one-day team in South Africa in 2005, he made three centuries.         
	On Thursday, he began quietly. He could have been run out without scoring, but Hashim Amla failed to collect Makhaya Ntinis wild throw with Pietersen well short of his ground.         
	After tea, though, Pietersen played an array of astonishing shots. He took a particular liking to Paul Harris, hitting 11 in one over. He brought up his 13th Test century, from 127 balls, with a handsome cut for four off Morne Morkel.         
	Earlier, it was the 66 Morkel who made the breakthrough after a disappointing morning session. England had reached 114 without loss when Morkel trapped Andrew Strauss lbw.         
	Three runs later, Steyn bowled Michael Vaughan. Five balls later, Morkel dug a sharply rising delivery in at Alastair Cook and he fended it to slip.         
	The only South African bowler to make an impression in the first session was the 31-year-old Makhaya Ntini.         
	Although he has lost raw pace, Ntini has discovered some movement and seam and had both openers playing and missing in his opening spell.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir has been most impressive: Wessels
                                                                                                                                                                                             Gambhir has been most impressive: Wessels
            A STAFF REPORTER            Wessels                           
	Calcutta: Kepler Wessels feels Delhi DareDevils opener Gautam Gambhir has been the most impressive among the Indian players in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Gambhir has been the most impressive so far. Hes adapted very well to the format and has been consistent with his performance. He scores quickly and has always kept the bowlers on their toes. Hes been the best on view, the Chennai Super Kings coach told The Telegraph.         
	Gambhir has the highest aggregate with 465 runs from 11 matches at an average of 46.50. Wessels also had a word of praise for his teams captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Hes been brilliant too. Hes been among the runs and his leadership has also been good. He has scored runs under pressure, the hallmark of a great player. Overall, he has been leading the team from the front.         
	The former South Africa captain (a Test centurion on debut for Australia, too) also picked Super Kings Matthew Hayden and Michael Hussey for special mention among the overseas players.         
	They started off with a flourish but had to leave early They had done reasonably well. Among the other foreigners, Adam Gilchrist has also done reasonably well considering the dipping fortunes of Deccan Chargers. Lately Shaun Pollock has been gradually coming into his own Hes proved he can still be dangerous with the ball, Wessels said.         
	He didnt wish to mention any other Indian who had impressed him. Its a tough choice, he said. There have been good individual performances in some of the matches. Sadly, the consistency was missing. That is most important in a tournament like this.         
	Back in March, Wessels said that a teams fortunes in the IPL will depend largely on the quality of the local players. His words are proving to be prophetic.         
	He, however, felt the IPL could turn out to be a good breeding ground for the youngsters. Its serving to be a good breeding ground. It helps to raise the profile of a player. It puts him up in competition with the best in the business. This can steel him up for future battles, Wessels explained.         
	Happy to back at the Eden after 15 years, it has brought back sweet memories. He was part of the South Africa side that played the historic one-dayer at the Eden in November 1991 after being readmitted to world cricket. Batting at No.3, he was the teams highest scorer with a half century. Then he was here again during the Hero Cup in 1993.         
	Its nice to be back. It brings back good old memories. Its always been special Dont think the ground has changed too much.

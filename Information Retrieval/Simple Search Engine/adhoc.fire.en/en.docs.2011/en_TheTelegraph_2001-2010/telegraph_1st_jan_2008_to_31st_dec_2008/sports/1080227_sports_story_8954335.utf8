                                                   Need experience in Tests: Gary

              
	Mumbai: India coach-designate Gary Kirsten feels experience matters in Tests while the shorter versions require youthful grit and vigour. 
    
	Under Mahendra Singh Dhoni the (limited overs) squad looks very energetic. They are a bunch of young players and its great for Indian cricket. I was really encouraged with their ability to fight till the death and put in a determined effort even when the chips were down, said the former South Africa opener here on Tuesday. 
    
	Kirsten was here to meet BCCI officials and Test captain Anil Kumble. The duo held discussions with BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, treasurer N. Srinivasan and CAO Ratnakar Shetty. 
    
	At Test level one must always be careful. Tests require an uncompromising environment. We need the experience in Tests, may be more so than in one-dayers. So I would like to see a smooth content of players going to Test in time, he said. 
    
	Kirsten said the transition would be tough. Its going to be a tough transition and we may have to irritate a few players on the way, he said. 
    
	He (Kumble) has proved his worth and has tremendous leadership qualities. Hes done a tremendous job as a (Test) captain and the team is looking good, Kirsten said. 
    
	Kirsten said the immediate priority for him was to identify the support staff following the decision of physio John Gloster and trainer Gregory King to disassociate themselves from the squad. 
    
	Vengsarkar worried 
    
	Lack of quality spinners at the domestic level is the biggest concern for chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar who fears that the advent of twenty20 cricket will have an adverse impact on slow bowlers, adds another report from New Delhi. 
    
	It (lack of good spinners) is our biggest concern. And, now with twenty20 in vogue, the spinners will have very little chance to parade their talent, the former Indian captain said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai XI humiliate England 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mumbai XI humiliate England 
                      
	Mumbai: England were dismissed for 98 in a humiliating 124-run loss to a second-string Mumbai XI on Tuesday, a jolt to their preparations ahead of the seven-match ODI series against India.         
	England captain Kevin Pietersen elected to field and the local team, comprising club professionals, made 222 for seven in 50 overs. Only three Englishmen reached double-figures in a terrible reply, particularly after opening the tour with a 122-run win over a Mumbai Cricket Association team on Sunday.         
	Today and what happened the other day doesnt really count in the grand scheme of things... nobody really cares about what happened in practice games, said Pietersen, who was bowled without scoring after facing eight balls. It is the internationals that count. Nobody goes into a practice game at 120 per cent like you do in an international.         
	Brief scores: MCA XI 222/7 in 50 ovs (P. Valthaty 44, S. Marathe 65, S. Shaikh 37; S. Harmison 2/38). England 98 in 25 ovrs G. Swann 24 .., J. Anderson 20; R. Verma 2/12, K. Waingankar 5/37, R. Shaikh 3/35). MCA XI won by 124 runs.

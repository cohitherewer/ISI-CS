The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I was not trying to prove anything to anyone: Yuvi 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       I was not trying to prove anything to anyone: Yuvi

	Rajkot: Yuvraj Singh, who single-handedly demolished the England bowling line-up and set up Indias victory in the first ODI here on Friday, said that he had not gone out to prove anything to anyone.         
	The visitors lost by 158 runs courtesy a blitzkrieg unbeaten 138 by Yuvraj.         
	Yes, it was disappointing to miss out on the Test series against Australia but I was very happy with the Indian teams performance (2-0 series win). I did not go into the match today with the intention of proving anything to anyone other than myself. I wanted to prove to myself that I was good enough to play at this level, he told reporters.         
	Yuvraj hit seven sixes and 15 fours in his 78-ball blitz, narrowly missing out on joining former captain Mohammed Azharuddin as the scorer of the fastest one-day hundred for India.         
	The 26-year-old notched up what was his ninth hundred in 64 balls while Azhars had come in 62.         
	He admitted that he had initially been a bit nervous after coming to the crease.         
	I was a bit nervous but the blazing start provided by Viru and Gambhir allowed me to play quietly in the beginning. The fact that Suresh Raina was playing shots at the other end also eased the pressure on me. It gave me time to settle down and to get to know what the wicket was about, he said.         
	Yuvraj, who felt a twitch while batting, rated the knock among his best in one-day cricket. He also said that England captain Kevin Pietersen had not surprised him by allowing him to have a runner as the injury had occurred during the game.         
	I felt a twitch when I turned for a run when Pietersen was bowling. It was an injury that happened when I batted and I had not carried it into the match. I was not surprised when the runner was allowed, he said.         
	I want to play the next match, but will not if I am not hundred per cent fit. I felt some problem only while pulling the ball. The team physio will let you know of my progress, he added.         
	Yuvraj said he has been surprised by the absence of left-arm spinner Monty Panesar from the English squad.         
	Indian wickets do not favour fast bowlers but help the spinners. Thats why Im surprised Monty is not playing. He bowls in the good areas and spins the ball well, he said.         
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was delighted with the perfect start and even said that losing the toss turned out to be a blessing in disguise.         
	Losing the toss was a blessing in disguise we had also wanted to field, Dhoni said. We expected the pitch to help the seamers in the first 30-45 minutes but the pitch didnt do much.         
	Dhoni was effusive in his praise for Yuvraj. After the fantastic start given by Sehwag, Gambhir and Raina, Yuvraj was simply fantastic. On a day like this, the opposition cannot do much. That kind of innings just takes you through, he said.         
	His opposite number Kevin Pietersen also doffed his hat at Yuvraj and felt England indeed could do little against such devastating batting by the Indians but vowed his team would bounce back.         
	At the end of the day when you stand up and watch an innings like Yuvrajs  Sehwag and Gambhir also played well  you just have to say well played guys, Pietersen said.         
	Yuvraj played an absolutely fantastic innings. He hit even good balls for sixes. Its definitely disappointing to lose. But there are six games left in the series and we intend to bounce back and hit India hard on Monday. We will give them a run for their money.         
	.         
	He dismissed any suggestions that Yuvraj had faked the injury. He did not carry the injury into the match but got injured while batting. It can happen to any of us. You have to trust Yuvraj. He got injured and would not have otherwise called for a runner.         
	England coach Peter Moores criticised his bowlers, saying they lacked aggression but defended Pietersens decision to field first on a batting pitch         
	Our bowlers didnt bowl consistently all the way through. They could have been more aggressive with the ball, Moores said. We have got some quick bowlers who are tall and generate enough bounce. But they were not aggressive enough. (AGENCIES)

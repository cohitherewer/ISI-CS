                                                   Members must pay: Prasun
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) members will have to pay up to watch the forthcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) matches at the Eden.         
	This was confirmed by CAB president Prasun Mukherjee, who returned to the city on Friday night following his meeting with the Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd authorities.         
	Yes the members will have to buy the tickets, he said. But those will come at a discount, added Mukherjee.         
	The CAB president was involved in a marathon meeting with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khans company regarding ticket rates and CABs share from the IPL matches.         
	Mukherjee said tickets would be reasonably priced and would be sold from different city outlets. I can assure you that tickets (both daily and seasonal) would be affordable for the common man.

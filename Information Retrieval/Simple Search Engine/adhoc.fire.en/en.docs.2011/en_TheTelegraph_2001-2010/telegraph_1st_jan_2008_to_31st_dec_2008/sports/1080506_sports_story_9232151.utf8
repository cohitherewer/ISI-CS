The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib brings a presence, says coach John Buchanan
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shoaib brings a presence, says coach John Buchanan
    - The rules are the same for everybody and there wont be exceptions           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kolkata Knight Riders coach John Buchanan at a city hotel on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: John Buchanans If Better Is Possible has recently been released and appears to be doing quite well. The same, though, cant be said of the team hes coaching at present  the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Buchanan, clearly, has much on his plate and its to be seen whether the fiery Shoaib Akhtars presence lessens his headache.         
	On Monday evening, some hours before Shoaibs dramatic arrival here, Buchanan spoke to The Telegraph exclusively about the quick.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the general belief that handling Shoaib is the biggest challenge for coaches         
	(Grins) Im approaching the task with an open mind Obviously, Shoaib has a reputation, not only on the field but off it too There are rules in place and there are ways in which the team has been operating The rules are the same for everybody and there wont be exceptions, no matter who you are. As long as Shoaib understands whats in place and abides by the rules, there shouldnt be any drama.         
	Any interaction with Shoaib which comes to mind readily         
	I dont think weve ever had a lengthy chat.         
	Shoaib having been off competitive cricket for months         
	I talked to (Pakistan coach) Geoff Lawson around the start of the IPL and he said that Shoaib hadnt been fitter He brings pace to the table and is possibly one of those players who could emerge a Twenty20 specialist Thats because Shoaib wont have to bowl more than four overs He could just run in for those four overs and make an impact.         
	The role he has in mind for Shoaib         
	Look, pace is pretty important One of the things were looking for in the team is for somebody to stand up and have a presence We could get that out of somebody like a Brad Hodge or a Salman Butt Equally, someone like Shoaib brings a presence Whether he plays or not, theres a real buzz around him.         
	Not playing to the galleries on the issue of Shoaibs availability for Thursdays match against the Bangalore Royal Challengers         
	There are a number of reasons why Ive announced he wont be in the XI that day For one, he hasnt played for a while and his fitness has to be assessed by (Andrew) Leipus Then, to include him, Id probably have to drop Umar Gul But, then, Gul has begun to hit the straps and Id like to keep him in the XI for as long as possible A whole range of reasons really.         
	A stand-out Shoaib performance which he remembers         
	It was a day-night ODI in Brisbane I cant recall the figures but I do remember that he picked out Australias top-order Shoaib had been lightning quick that day.         
	What hell be conveying to Shoaib         
	That these are my expectations from you and Im sure youve got expectations of me That this is how the team operates That these are the values we hold dear Welcome to the Knight Riders, but there are no special rules for anybody.         
	His message to the Ashok Dindas, who could begin to feel insecure with the arrival of a megastar         
	That a new member of the family has just arrived and we need to welcome him That both will need some time getting used to each other If somebody does feel insecure, hopefully, that feeling will go away quickly Shoaibs is a late inclusion Its not the best time, but all of us have to deal with it.         
	Finally, thoughts on Thursdays face-off at the Eden         
	(Smiles) Lets say Im quietly confident.

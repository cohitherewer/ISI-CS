            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indias football coach Bob Houghton believes that his tried and tested campaigners are still the best that Indian soccer has to offer. He spoke of identifying fresh talent in the ongoing I-League: I have identified some players I want some new faces in the squad But still the older ones are the best, Houghton said while watching the East Bengal vs Sporting Clube de Goa match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	I have selected some and they will be called for the national camp, he added.         
	It was learnt that India will visit Hong Kong on January 14 and play an exhibition match. The camp with a 28-member squad will be held in Goa from January.         
	Meanwhile, Houghton lost his mobile phone at the stadium. Stadium authorities were learnt to have lodged a complaint with the local police station.

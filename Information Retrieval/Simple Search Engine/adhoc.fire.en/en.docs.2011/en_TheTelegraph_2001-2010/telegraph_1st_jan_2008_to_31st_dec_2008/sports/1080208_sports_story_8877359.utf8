	Wellington: England beat New Zealand by 50 runs at Christchurch on Thursday to complete a 2-0 series sweep of their two Twenty20 internationals.         
	England followed up their 32 run win in Auckland on Tuesday with an even more emphatic victory to continue their perfect start to the two-month tour. England captain Paul Collingwood smashed a half-century to help his team compile a healthy total of 193 for eight before the tourists restricted New Zealand to 143 for eight in reply.         
	Collingwood blasted 54 off just 28 balls, including five boundaries and three sixes, and shared in a 102-run partnership with Owais Shah, who made a brisk 47.         
	New Zealands hopes of winning disappeared quickly when they crashed to 94 for seven in the 14th over.           (REUTERS)

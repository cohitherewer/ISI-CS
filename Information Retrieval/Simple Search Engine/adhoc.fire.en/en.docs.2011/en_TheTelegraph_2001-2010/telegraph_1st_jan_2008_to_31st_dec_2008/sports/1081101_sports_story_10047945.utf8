	Calcutta: United SC coach Subrata Bhattacharjee appeared pretty confident on the eve of the clubs sixth round ONGC I-League match, against Sporting Club de Goa, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	With three foreigners  Bidemi Daniel, Subair Murithala and Lewis  back in the side after a brief injury lay-off, veteran Bhattacharjee is hoping to make use of home advantage to bag full points against the Goan outfit which at present leads the table with 12 points from five matches.

	We will definitely go all out for a win, Bhattacharjee said after the practice session at the Central Park on Friday morning.         
	But it wont be easy. They are a good side and at the moment are in great touch So we need to be cautious A win will be great but we wont like to lose points. We need a mathematical approach, he elaborated.         
	But with Murithala, Daniel and Lewis back in the squad, we will be a better side tomorrow. In fact, playing on home ground will be to our advantage We want to utilise that in full, the coach added.         
	However, nippy striker Shankar Oraon, Sochungmi Raleng, veteran Sasthi Duley and goalkeeper Robikant Singh have been ruled out from Saturdays encounter.         
	Gopal Das will come in as the custodian and Subhasish Roy Choudhury, who was serving a suspension, is likely to make a comeback.         
	Sporting de Goa reached town late on Thursday. On a high after beating Mumbai FC 1-0 in their last outing, (their fourth win in five matches) the Goan club, will miss the services of medio Micky Fernandez due to booking.         
	After a one-and-half hour-long training session at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday morning, Sporting coach Vishwas Gaonkar predicted a keen contest.         
	Gaonkar said: Subrata is man who can make the difference. We need to be cautious about his strategies. And United SC are a good side too We are not taking them lightly.         
	However, we would like to maintain our winning momentum, the Sporting coach added.

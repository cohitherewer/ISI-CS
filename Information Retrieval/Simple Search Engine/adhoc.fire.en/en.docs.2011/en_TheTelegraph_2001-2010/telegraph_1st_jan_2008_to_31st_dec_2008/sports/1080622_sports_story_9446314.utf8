The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Croats overwhelmed by Turkish passion
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Croats overwhelmed by Turkish passion

	As a stultifying game laboured into extra time, Fabio Capello looked on from the smart seats, chatting to Bernie Ecclestone, who could be useful if things go badly for the England coach in Zagreb in September and he needs a fast car. Capello watched the Croats intently, admiring the influence of Vedran Corluka from right-back, the creativity of Luka Modric in midfield and the passing of Niko Kranjcar, pulling the strings in Bilics 4-4-1-1 formation.         
	Croatia could have won the game after 18 minutes but Bilics triumphant run across his technical area was aborted after an extraordinary sequence of misses. This was the type of counter attack that Croatia specialise in, suddenly springing forward with real pace.         
	Hope hung in the air for Croatia as Bilics journey across his permitted patch resumed. Surely the unmarked Kranjcar would put away the rebound?         
	Amazingly, the Portsmouth player headed over, leaving Modric pounding the turf in frustration and stopping Bilic in his jubilant tracks. One of the myriad reasons why Croatias players adore their charismatic manager is that Bilic shares their suffering, their joys, and seemingly their every tackle with his energetic pacing around the dug out. Moments of occasional concern creased Bilics brow in a scoreless first half.         
	Turkey gave everything.         
	For all their confidence and three group-stage victories, Bilics side actually found themselves placed under real pressure by Terims determined side for parts of the first half. Turkey were shorn of seven regulars, five injured and two suspended, but their collective will could not be weakened. Their pride guaranteed that. Their vocal fans demanded no less.         
	Terims passion-players fought hard, particularly in midfield where they kept pressurising Bilics men into ceding possession. To stop Croatia working the ball through Modric to Kranjcar and then on to Olic, Terim flooded midfield and ordered massed ambush parties whenever Croatia had the ball.         
	Turkeys nimble striker, Nihat Kahveci, led the line, offering an out ball, offering hope, looking for support from Colin Kazim-Richards and the left-sided Arda Turan out wide, or for Tuncay to drive through the middle.         
	Turkey enjoyed first-half moments of promise. Hamit Altintops fiercesome free-kick blocked by Niko Kovac, who embodied the Croatian creed by throwing himself in the way of the speeding ball, taking a bruise to the ribs.         
	Tuncay, a lively presence in midfield, screamed for a penalty when cutting in from the left, throwing himself forward as Josip Simunic stooped in front of him. Roberto Rosetti was unimpressed by Tuncay, and had earlier cautioned the Middlesbrough striker for elbowing Niko Kovac.         
	Their resolve embodied by Tuncay, Turkey were finishing the half strongly.         
	Turkey, as can be their way, allowed excess to stain their game, certainly as the second half commenced and Turan buried his studs in Simunics ankle. Shortly afterwards, Recber Rustu froze, almost allowing Olic a glimpse of goal, but Hakan Balta cleared.         
	Turkey continued to frustrate Croatia and sterility began to define the game, but Croatia almost broke through after 55 minutes. Modric found a yard of space and sent Kranjcar through but his shot, hurried as Turks dived in, lacked sufficient power to trouble Rustu.         
	Bilic sought another means of breakthrough, withdrawing Kranjcar and inviting Mladen Petric to run at Topal. Olic headed wide. Yet chances opened up more for Croatia. When Gokhan Zan tripped Petric 20-yard out, Dario Srna unleashed a magnificent free-kick that eluded Turkeys jumping wall but not the right glove of Rustu, who made an extraordinary save.         
	Shades of cynicism darkened Turkeys game as extra time beckoned, a body-check here, a shirt-pull there. More impressively, Rustu remained defiant, rolling back the years to save from Olic at close range and then Srnas long free-kick. Croatia so missed Eduardo here.         
	Both managers went to work on their players. Bilic gathered his players around, each of them listening intently to their leaders advice. Terim, his white shirt soaked with sweat, jabbed his finger at his exhausted players to make his points. Tuncay responded well, demanding a low save from Pletikosa at his near-post.         
	With two minutes remaining, Rustu made a terrible mistake, racing from his line to his left, hesitating fatefully, allowing the excellent Modric to turn and lift over a cross for Klasnic to head home. Bilic raced on to the pitch in celebration, but his joy was short-lived. Terims Turks kept going, and Semih Senturk equalised in spectacular fashion with seconds on the clock, so setting up some penalty drama for an audience that could have been forgiven for dozing off.

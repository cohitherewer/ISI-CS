The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Akhils defeat a big setback for duo
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Akhils defeat a big setback for duo
            MADHUMITA GANGULY                Vijender and Jitender                             
	Beijing: All eyes are trained on the boxing ring as Vijender Kumar and Jitender Kumar appear for their respective quarter final bouts on Wednesday.         
	In the 51kg flyweight, Jitender meets three-time European champion Georgy Balakshin of Russia while Vijender will take on Ecuadors Carlos Gongora in the 75kg middleweight.         
	Akhil Kumars loss to Veaceslav Gojan on Monday has thrown everybody out of gear, spreading a pall of gloom over the camp.         
	Since Akhils loss, Ive broken down mentally and I dont know how to get back on track.         
	The more Akhil is trying to motivate me, the more am I drowning in despair, Jitender told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	The youngest member of the squad had lost to Balakshin in the 2007 World Championship by just a point and was determined to avenge that defeat. So he must be having a strategy in place?         
	See, each of us have our tactics and strategies but in the ring everything happens in the spur of the moment. So Im really not thinking of strategies right now.         
	Balakshin had been stopped in the quarter finals in Athens by the eventual winner, Yuriorkis Gamboa Toledano of Cuba and the Russian will doubtless go all.         
	Vijender, unlike Jitender, was more in control of his emotions and said: Now the responsibility is on Jitender and me to get India a couple of medals more.         
	No, I havent played Gongora before but I believe that he is a good boxer. I have been watching a lot of videos on him. Our heights are about the same so I would not face any disadvantage on that count.         
	Though he is lower ranked than me, I am not underestimating him. Many an Olympic champion have lost their bouts here, he added.         
	The duo practised at the Datun gymnasium and geared up for the big night.         
	Im trying my best to cheer them up But am technically not trying to impart anything. I spoke to them today as yesterday we were all quite upset. I told them to remember that, jo jeeta wohi Sikandar, said Akhil.         
	Coach G. S. Sandhu preferred not to commit: After what happened with Akhil, lets just take things as they come, he said. Yesterday our strategy failed, so Id rather not predict a result.         
	The Ecuadorian Vijender is playing belongs to the sleeper category, he said, meaning that not very much is known about him but he is potential danger material. So one never knows he added.         
	Please put in a message on our behalf to our countrymen, added Jitender. Pray for both of us.

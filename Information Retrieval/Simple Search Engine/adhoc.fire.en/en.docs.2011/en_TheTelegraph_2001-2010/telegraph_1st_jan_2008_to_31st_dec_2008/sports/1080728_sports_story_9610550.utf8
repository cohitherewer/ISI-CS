The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Last-minute frenzy marks both camps
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Last-minute frenzy marks both camps
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The incumbent group and the opposition, both spent a busy day on Sunday pitching for last minute votes through day-long campaigning, 48 hours before the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections.         
	Joint secretary Amitava Banerjee spent the whole day amid administrative work at his CAB office, including printing of ballot papers.         
	Samar Paul, the other joint secretary, went around campaigning in the city for the ruling group.         
	The opposition met at Jagmohan Dalmiyas south Calcutta office in the evening to discuss last minute gameplan.         
	Both camps exuded confidence in their panels and claimed that they would emerge victorious in the elections on Tuesday.         
	However, sources revealed that the present situation was too close for both camps to be confident of a comfortable victory.         
	Its impossible for anybody to say that they are 100 per cent comfortable about winning the elections. Its too close to say anything at the moment, said a source.         
	However, with the cancellation of Malda DSAs Subhasish Sarkars nomination, a race has started in both camps to woo a vice-president candidate from the opposite side.         
	Both sides are left with three candidates each for the four vice-presidential posts. Thus, if one candidate switches side, the equation changes drastically.         
	Each voter will be given six ballot papers of different colours for the six categories of nomination  president, vice-presidents, joint-secretaries, treasurer, Board of Trustees, Trustee Board chairman.         
	Court-appointed observer Justice Santosh Kumar Phoujdar will visit the CAB on Monday at 4 pm to take note of the arrangements.

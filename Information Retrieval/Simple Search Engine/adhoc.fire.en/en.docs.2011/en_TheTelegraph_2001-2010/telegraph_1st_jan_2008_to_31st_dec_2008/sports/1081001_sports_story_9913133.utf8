The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger Woods absence will lead to new world order 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tiger Woods absence will lead to new world order 
            Lewine Mair            Tiger Woods could be out till 2010                           
	As the United States team found in the Ryder Cup, the golfing landscape alters dramatically without Tiger Woods.         
	There were plenty in the US camp who attributed their first victory for nine years to the fact that the American players had bonded better than usual. And they put that down to having no Woods in their midst.         
	Now, it seems, it will not only be the victorious Americans at Valhalla who find that the old order of things no longer applies. For with it likely to be anything up to two years before the world No. 1 is back to his best, the time is ripe for other new faces to emerge from Woods shadow.         
	Though many are expecting Woods to tee up at next years US Masters, just nine months after the latest operation on his left knee, that could be expecting too much. Lanny L. Johnson, the renowned American doctor, has warned that it could be 2010 before the player is back in full cry.         
	Johnson, who has also invented apparatus to help top golfers, including Vijai Singh, to find the same steady hand on the greens required by a surgeon, cites some pertinent experiments which have been taking place at the Shirley Centre for Orthopaedic Research.         
	A colleague of his, Clifford Cowell, whose headquarters are at the Scripps Clinic in California, has been installing sensors in replacement knee joints to identify the load-bearing qualities required of that joint. What has been discovered thus far is that in the normal course of events a person needs his knee to take up to 21/2 times his body weight, and 31/2 times when he is rising from a sitting position.         
	When it comes to swinging a golf club, the demands are 31/2 times for the back leg and 41/2 times for the front. Since the golfers involved in the experiment were elderly and swinging at no more than 65mph, the doctor said they had no figures for someone who, like Tiger, swung the club at 135mph. We can only speculate that they are a lot higher, he said.         
	With regard to the micro-fractures to which Woods admitted in the wake of his limping victory in the US Open, the doctor explained that such cracks are more common in the thigh. That they occurred where they did is something he puts down to Woods insistence on keeping going during the US Open he won at Torrey Pines.         
	Yet whatever the additional damage that was done, Woods was still able to beat Rocco Mediate and increase his number of majors to 14  just four short of the Jack Nicklaus collection.         
	If Johnson is right with his timetables, Woods will be ready for the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor in south Wales. Even if he were to play nothing more than a skeletal schedule in 2009, he would still have plenty of time to pin down his automatic slot in the spring and summer of 2010, when there will be twice as many points on offer.         
	If, however, he were in need of a wild card, that could make for problems in the wake of the US teams recent performance without him.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The right time to win, says   Serena
                                                                                                                                                                                                     The right time to win, says   Serena
                            
	Paris: Former world No. 1 Serena Williams said on Friday that Justine Henins retirement made it the right time for the American to win a second French Open title.         
	Williams, who was victorious at Roland Garros in 2002, is the only former winner in the draw for the second Grand Slam of the year which starts on Sunday.         
	Its definitely the right time to win, obviously.         
	Its always the right time but its unfortunate one of the best players on clay wont be here, Williams, who starts her campaign against compatriot Ashley Harkleroad, told a news conference.         
	Henin, who won four French Open four titles in the past five years, retired from tennis last week as the world No.1, leaving Paris hopefuls with greater expectations than last year.         
	Asked how she would rate her title chances, Williams said: I feel like my scale is going up right now.         
	I feel like so far Ive probably gotten to a 5 or a 6 but Im still able to climb up.         
	Its probably the best preparation Ive had since 2002. Im really comfortable out there on the clay, so its great, added the world No. 5 who won the Family Circle Cup on clay in Charleston, South Carolina last month.         
	Williams, who has eight Grand Slams to her name, said that she has shrugged off a back problem that forced her to retire from her Italian Open quarter final match against Frances Alize Cornet in Rome last week.         
	Im definitely 100 per cent fit. Im feeling a lot better than last week, she said.           (REUTERS)

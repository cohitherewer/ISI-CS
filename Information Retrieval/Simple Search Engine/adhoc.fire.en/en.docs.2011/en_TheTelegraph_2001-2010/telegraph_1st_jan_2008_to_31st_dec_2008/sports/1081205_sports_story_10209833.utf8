The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen: Its important   we go back 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pietersen: Its important   we go back 
                            
	London: England captain Kevin Pietersen said on Thursday he was confident that his team will travel to India for next weeks first Test in Chennai despite the recent atrocities in the country.         
	England squad left for Abu Dhabi on Thursday where they will practise while England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) security experts evaluate the situation in Chennai where the first Test is scheduled to start next Thursday.         
	They returned home last week after the one-day International series was cut short following the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.         
	Weve bought ourselves some more time in Abu Dhabi, Pietersen told reporters at Heathrow airport before boarding the plane. Its very important that we go back, shoulder to shoulder with the Indian people in their time of need.         
	What we want to do is show our support by hopefully playing some Test cricket. We will assess the situation on Sunday but Im very confident that we will go to play a Test match next week in Chennai.         
	However, Pietersen said the players would not make a final decision until they had received all the latest reports from the ECBs security manager Reg Dickason and Sean Morris, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers Association.         
	The guys that go out there now are just waiting on the reports from Reg and Sean. If there are any major alarm bells ringing then I think he will be ringing to say that the collective decision is to come home.         
	But as it stands at the moment, the boys are focused on going to play some red ball cricket in Abu Dhabi and then hopefully the Test match on Thursday in Chennai.         
	Definitely the impact on world cricket was at the back of my mind. Its something you think about. But, at the end of the day, safety and security is paramount. Thats the most important thing in this situation, he added.         
	Hugh Morris, the managing director of England cricket, said discussions were continuing with the Indian authorities on Thursday.         
	The Board have made it absolutely clear that the safety and security of the players and the ECB employees is of utmost importance and we need to make sure the necessary security is in place, he said.         
	Meanwhile, concerned by hijack threats at Indian airports which have been put on high alert, the ECB said it was keeping a close watch on the situation.         
	Morris said they had asked for more information on the reported hijack threat and will take into account the revelations before making a final decision.         
	Obviously were concerned, but what we need to do is find out the information. Ive spoken to the security team in Chennai already to find out exactly what the situation is with the alerts.         
	When we get that information itll be fed back to me, to the board and form part of the security audit that were undertaking, Morris said at the Heathrow airport, ahead of the squads departure for Abu Dhabi.

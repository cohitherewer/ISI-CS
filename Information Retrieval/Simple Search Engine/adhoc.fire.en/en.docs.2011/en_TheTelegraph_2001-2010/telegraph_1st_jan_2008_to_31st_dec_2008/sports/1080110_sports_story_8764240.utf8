	Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona has filed charges against businessman Ernesto Texo for stealing hundreds of memorabilia items shown around the world in his itinerant M10 museum, the Argentine greats official website has said. 
    
	The 600 pieces of memorabilia, including the 1995 Golden Ball and gifts from Brazilian football icon Pele and Cuban President Fidel Castro, were on exhibition since 2003 but are presently tied up in customs in several countries due to the organisers failure to meet his obligations, the website said. 
    
	The complaint said: Texo and his associates improperly took possession of these objects after being tasked with organising the itinerant M10 museum that visited Argentina, Italy and Mexico, among other countries. 
    
	The memorabilia also includes several international trophies, numerous T-shirts Maradona - whose shirt number was 10  exchanged after international matches with other famous football players, and other sports clothing worn by Maradona throughout his career.

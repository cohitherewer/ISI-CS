The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Battle for Liverpool heats up
                                                                                                                                                                                           Battle for Liverpool heats up
                      
	London: The battle between Liverpool FC owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett, and potential buyer Dubai International Capital (DIC), will go on for a few weeks as DIC isnt prepared to increase its 500 million ($998 million) offer, sources familiar with the deal said on Friday.         
	The situation has fallen into a deadlock as Hicks and Gillett dont want to sell their 50 per cent stakes to each other, while the agreement under which they bought the club last year doesnt say what to do in such situation, leaving a legal void on its resolution, the sources said.         
	The parties want to avoid litigation, the sources said.         
	Whilst Gillett has said he would sell his stake to DIC, Hicks may be waiting for a better offer. This may not happen as the two Americans would already make a considerable profit at the present offer price as they bought the British soccer club for about 230 million last year.         
	The 500 million offer includes 350 million of debt, one of the sources said.         
	DIC is awaiting the outcome of Hickss negotiations with US investment bank JPMorgan over a loan to his sports group, as failure to repay may force him to sell some of his assets if there is a buyer, one of the sources said.         
	Gillett, accused Hicks of causing turmoil at the club after the latter earlier on Thursday vowed to buy him out during a wide-ranging interview with Sky Sports.         
	Hicks also branded Liverpool chief executive Rick Parrys tenure adisaster, and repeated his call for him to quit and said the club was lagging behind top European rivals by failing to capitalise on commercial opportunities in Asia.         
	Gillett said in a statement issued on Thursday: I am saddened at this latest outburst from Tom Hicks. If Tom wanted a serious discussion on the issues to help the club move forward, he should bring his views to the board and not to Sky Sports.         
	Here we are, a few days away from a vital Champions League semi-final match and Tom has once again created turmoil with his public comments, added Gillett.           (REUTERS)

                                                                                                                                                                                                     India eye second spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India have to wait for the result of the South Africa-England series even if they manage a 3-0 clean sweep over Sri Lanka to regain the second spot in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship table.         
	The series win will leave India on 118 and South Africa on 116. India are currently ranked third behind Australia and South Africa while Sri Lanka are placed fifth.         
	If India win 2-1 and South Africa also triumph by the same margin, Anil Kumbles side will still be third. And if they share the series with Sri Lanka, and South Africa win 2-1 in England, then India will have 112 ratings points, compared to South Africas 116.         
	However, if Sri Lanka win the series 2-0 and South Africa beat England 2-1, Sri Lanka (110) then will leapfrog both India (108) and England (104) to third place.         
	Identical 3-0 win for Sri Lanka and South Africa will leave India on 106 and England on 102. Mahela Jayawardenes men who then will have 112 ratings points will move to third behind South Africa (119).         
	Meanwhile, in the rankings for batsmen, Sri Lanka wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara leads the rankings. No Indian batsman figures in the top 10.

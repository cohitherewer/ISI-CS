                                                   One step at a time: Dravid
                      
	Bangalore: Former Team India captain Rahul Dravid is not looking at the Indian Premier League (IPL) as a vehicle to return to the one-day squad but says he will just focus on playing good cricket and enjoy the new version of the game.         
	I am not thinking about it that way. I am focusing and trying to play good cricket and be fit. I just want to enjoy it and take it as one step at a time, Dravid said.         
	Dravid admitted that he had not thought about the IPL when he refused participation in the ICC World Twenty20.         
	I did not, to be very honest with you. But things happen and its exciting to be a part of something new, like I said its a journey, he said.         
	Wednesday saw the launch of the Vijay Mallya-owned Royal Challengers Bangalore team with the liquor baron seeking to promote the brands of United Breweries group.         
	Cricket connects millions of Indians. Cricket is the perfect platform for our brands to engage with young India. The equity that our brands gain from this association is the real potential for us, Mallya said in a statement.         
	At the same time, there is no compromise on the cricket standards and developing the entertainment potential further, he said, adding, nothing would distract the team from doing its best to win the title.         
	Led by Dravid, the team has the likes of Anil Kumble, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Misbah-ul Haq, Zaheer Khan, Nathan Bracken, and Jacques Kallis.         
	Venkatesh Prasad is the coach. Martin Crowe is the chief cricket officer and he would focus on the strategic aspects, according to the CEO of the team Charu Sharma.         
	The team has tied up with Reebok for the sporting gear and Louis Philippe for formals. Manoviraj Khosla has designed special uniforms for the cheerleaders.           (PTI)

   A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL
                  
	Perth: Ian Healy was, for years, the most successful wicketkeeper in Test cricket. On Friday, the 43-year-old spoke to The Telegraph. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
       
	On his impressions of Mahendra Singh Dhoni 
    
	I first saw him in Sri Lanka during a limited overs tournament in 2005 and Ive been impressed with the way hes developed as a person and as a keeper... Its remarkable that hes even led India (in ODIs and Twenty20) while his own game is developing... 
    
	On the importance of the ongoing tour for Dhoni 
    
	Its one big learning curve for him... This tour, perhaps, is where hell learn the most and I must say it has come at the right time for him. 
    
	On Dhoni, at one time, having been a strong contender for the Test captaincy too 
    
	Its good that your selectors didnt give him that responsibility... Keeping to (Anil) Kumble and worrying about what others are doing wouldve been too much for Dhoni... Kumble wont be around for too long and, so, its good that Dhoni has got this opportunity to work with such a senior pro... Dhoni, as I see it, has much to gain from this tour. 
    
	On his experience of having captained in ODIs, in a stand-in capacity 
    
	I did feel I had to do too many things... Captaincy probably wont make a difference if youre steamrolling opponents and if you dont have to keep to many spinners... But, if youve got a fight on your hands, then its definitely going to be tough. 
    
	On Adam Gilchrist who, at 36, isnt getting any younger 
    
	He can continue for as long as he wants... Weve had a pretty easy 12 months, but theres lots of cricket in the next 12... If he has the energy and is playing for the right reasons, then he can continue beyond next summer too. 
    
	On whether, in the lead-up to his retirement (in 1999), hed grown tired mentally 
    
	Indeed, yes... It became a mental thing... Id stopped enjoying practice, when my game was built around a solid preparation... Then, there was the pressure of having to perform day in and day out and not make mistakes... That began getting to me... I also started feeling it physically. 
    
	On Australias current No.2 keeper, Brad Haddin 
    
	I rate him extremely highly and hes as competent as any in the world. However if Gilchrist continues for, say, two-three seasons then the selectors will probably need to get somebody younger. 
    
	On Mark Boucher, the most successful keeper 
    
	Hes good and is a fierce competitor... Besides, he has quite a few years left in him... 
    
	On keepers today being more conscious that theyve got to be good batters as well 
    
	I think this trend began in the 1970s... Having said that, you still need to be making dismissals and not missing dismissals. Left to me I wouldnt sacrifice any keeping quality for the sake of a few runs... For me, it has to be an out and out specialist. 
    
	On the skills needed by a keeper 
    
	The keeper has to be technically sound otherwise his game will come apart at the highest level... Hes got to have agility and should be able to set fielding standards... The basic skills have to be displayed ball in and ball out... Indeed, everybody cant keep... 
    
	On whether one has to be born a keeper 
    
	The qualities have to be recognised early and, then, developed... The keeper has to be a pretty natural catcher and a pretty natural mover... The natural instincts have to be moulded into keeping techniques... One needs time to develop. 
    
	On working with the Centre of Excellence in Brisbane 
    
	I work with the countrys elite keepers there... Besides, Im available for individuals... Tomorrow, if Dhoni wants to have a chat, Ill be available. 
    
	On whether theres a standout keeper on the circuit 
    
	Gilchrists as good as any and I quite like Sri Lankas Prasanna Jayawardene... In the years to come, hell be talked about in a big way. 
    
	On the dearth of standout keepers 
    
	(Smiles) Dont know why... Could be because theres too much cricket... Could be because, nowadays, the keepers are less flamboyant... Difficult to pin a reason. 
    
	On whether that could be because the present-day keepers are probably paying more attention to their batting 
    
	I think so, but that cant be an excuse... 
    
	On a keeper constantly having to remain in the switched-on mode 
    
	With so much responsibility, you cant afford not to... Mental toughness, for me, is the ability to watch the ball when the pressures on and to react. 
    
	Finally, his message to budding keepers 
    
	Watch the ball... If youre doing that and moving well, you can rarely go wrong.

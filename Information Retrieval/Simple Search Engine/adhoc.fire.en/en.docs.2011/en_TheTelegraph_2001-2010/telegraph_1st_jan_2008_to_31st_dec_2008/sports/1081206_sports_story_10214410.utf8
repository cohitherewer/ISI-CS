The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Change hits Rauf hard
                                                                                                                                                                                           Change hits Rauf hard
                      
	Karachi: The ICCs elite panel umpire Asad Rauf of Pakistan has had to shelve his plans to officiate in the first Test between India and England at Chennai from December 11 due to a visa problem and is unsure about his availability for the second and final match as well.         
	I was appointed for the two Tests in Ahmedabad and Mumbai respectively. But since the venues have now been switched to Chennai and Mohali, I need fresh visas for these centres, Rauf said.         
	The Indian cricket authorities changed the venues for the Tests after the Mumbai terror attacks last week.         
	Asad said he had informed the ICC about his problem and was not sure if he would be able to get a visa for the Mohali Test.         
	I had no time to apply for a visa for the December 11-15 Chennai match due to the Eid festival holidays. But the Indian embassy has announced a new visa policy so I am not sure about the second Test as well, he said.         
	Pakistan nationals in the past could get visas in 15-days time, but after the Mumbai attack their consulate has announced that it would take around a month to process visa application because of security reasons.         
	Rauf, however, made it clear he had no security concerns for going to India. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indias big guns face the Murali, Mendis test
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indias big guns face the Murali, Mendis test
  - No one thing alone is going to make a difference, says Kumble       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                        Spin Doctor!  Team India Test captain Anil Kumble during a practice session at the SSC ground in Colombo on Tuesday, the eve of the first Test against Sri Lanka. (AP)      
	Colombo: Manmohan Singh and his allies found a way to win the trust vote on Tuesday evening. That too comfortably. By Wednesday morning, Anil Kumble and his men will have to fine-tune ways to handle spinners Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis.         
	One is a legend and a known commodity, the other may remain a mystery for longer than the batsmen would like. Neutralising them is an absolute must.         
	In Kumbles view, the pressure will be on the 23-year-old Mendis, an armyman (promoted as Second-Lieutenant after a terrific Asia Cup) wholl be making his Test debut.         
	Its with this backdrop that the newest India-Sri Lanka series, a three-match affair for the Idea Cup, will begin at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC), one of the few grounds with a truly lovely cricket feel in the region.         
	With the umpire referral business going on trial from this series, the SSC is set to see history of a different kind.         
	Going by what captains Kumble and Mahela Jayawardene said, both teams have enormous respect for each others capabilities. But that doesnt mean the series wont be contested with, say, the fierceness of matches against Australia.         
	For Team India, its an opportunity to win back the No.2 ranking in Tests.         
	The Indians, incidentally, havent featured in a Test series in Lanka for seven years and, so, the connoisseurs around here have actually had a long wait. This surely is their last chance to see Indias Big Four in action  Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Kumble.         
	Of the quartet, a milestone beckons Sachin: 172 runs more and hell surpass Brian Lara as the highest run-getter in Tests. Its not that runs/wickets wont be special for the other three, all of whom too are past 35.         
	Of course, a Sourav would like you to believe that age is only an issue with cricket back home. Perhaps hes right.         
	Traditionally, the Indians havent had a great Test record in Lanka (just two wins in 12 matches) and thats something Kumble would like to set right. He himself wasnt available for that 2001-02 series, which ended in a 1-2 defeat.         
	The task, though, will be anything but easy.         
	However, Lankas new-ball attack has been weakened by the continued absence of Lasith Malinga and the once-again-injured Dilhara Fernando.         
	Its to be seen to what extent thats made capital of.         
	Jayawardene, though, was quick to point out that his team took immense pride in defending a very fine record at home.         
	We dont want anyone else to come and beat us at home. Thats the attitude we go with... There is a lot of pride involved.         
	With plenty at stake, pride is definitely a factor.         
	Look, no one thing alone is going to make a difference... It will be a combination of factors, not only big runs on the board, a typically cool Kumble told The Telegraph.         
	An injury made Kumble miss the last Test, versus South Africa, in Kanpur. He played in the IPL, but having retired from ODIs, is coming off a break. In his own words, hes absolutely raring to go.         
	In whats quite rare, owing to one reason or the other, as many as five Indians will be making a comeback  Gautam Gambhir (Virender Sehwags opening partner), Sachin, Dinesh Karthik, Zaheer Khan and the captain himself  in the Test XI.         
	Quick Ishant Sharma developed a dental problem, but manager T.C. Matthew confirmed that his availability wasnt in doubt. Hes fit for the Test.         
	Whats also not in doubt is that the captain winning the toss wont hesitate to bat. It looks a good wicket, Kumble maintained, his tone confirming it would be good not having to bat last.

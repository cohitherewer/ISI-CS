The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant prefers Test cricket
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ishant prefers Test cricket
                      
	New Delhi: Crickets shorter versions may be in vogue but Team India pacer Ishant Sharma says, for a player nothing can beat the thrill of competing in Tests.         
	Test cricket is the top format of the game. It is the format which makes a cricketer. The honour that one gets while performing in Test cricket is unmatched, Ishant said on the sidelines of launching the T10 gully cricket tournament, starting next year.         
	But the teenage pace sensation is all for innovations in the game  the latest being a 10-overs-a-side gully cricket tournament for which he has been appointed brand ambassador.         
	The bounce that I generate is something I learnt while playing gully cricket and thats why I am happy that such innovations are happening. For those who dont get too many opportunities, this will be great, he said.         
	The pacer dismissed suggestions that shorter formats will ultimately kill the game.         
	You cant say that, he retorted when asked whether the matches may just end up being decided by a toss of coin considering the rate at which the overs are being reduced.

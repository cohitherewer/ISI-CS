                                                    Chopra, Bhatia lead Delhi fightback

	Mumbai: Delhi recovered from a disastrous start through an unfinished 160-run stand between Aakash Chopra and Rajat Bhatia to finish at 196 for four in the first innings against Uttar Pradesh on the second day of the five-day Ranji Trophy final here Thursday. 
    
	Chopra remained unbeaten on 85 off 205 balls with 15 fours to his credit, while the more adventurous and attacking Bhatia was batting on 81, made in 135 balls with the help of ten fours and three sixes. 
    
	At stumps, Delhi were 146 runs adrift of UPs first innings tally of 342 after tottering at 15 for three before lunch and then 36 for four. 
    
	Delhi were on the backfoot after a three-wicket burst by UP medium-pacer Praveen Kumar who sent back their skipper Gautam Gambhir (zero), Shikhar Dhawan (14) and Mithun Manhas (zero). 
    
	Sudip Tyagi scalped Aditya Jain (eight) for his 40th wicket of the season to leave Delhi in further trouble before they were rescued by the calm assurance of Chopra, who has batted for 269 minutes, and the more aggressive Bhatia, who has batted for 184 minutes. 
    
	Earlier, Delhi grabbed the last three first innings wickets of UP while conceding 50 runs after the latter started the morning at an overnight 292 for seven. 
    
	Ravikant Shukla, who had rescued UP in the company of Tanmay Srivastava (105), missed his century by four runs after resuming at 80. He was ninth out after having stayed at the wicket for a marathon 444 minutes and faced 232 balls during which he struck 10 fours.

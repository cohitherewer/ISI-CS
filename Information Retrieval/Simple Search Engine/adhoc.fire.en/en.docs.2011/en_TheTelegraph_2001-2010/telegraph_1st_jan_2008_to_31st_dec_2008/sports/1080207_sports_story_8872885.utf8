The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ecclestone delivers final warning to British GP
                                                Ecclestone delivers final warning to British GP

	The prospects of Britain holding on to its Formula One Grand Prix appeared slim despite positive noises coming out of Silverstone about local authority approval for the circuits grand designs. F1s commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, said the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC), who own the 780-acre Silverstone site, had only months to commit to a new deal at the market rate or the British Grand Prix, which has until 2009 to run, would be no more.         
	Assume the facilities are built and we like it. The next problem is the commercial agreement for us (the Grand Prix) to be there, Ecclestone said. This has not been discussed other than the guy (from the BRDC) who came to see me some time ago saying there is no way we (BRDC) could pay you even what we have paid you in the past.         
	So there are two things to overcome. First they need to build the facilities, then they need to pay the market rate.         
	There is no sentiment in this from my point of view.         
	I want (from the BRDC) only what we do in any other country, no more, no less. I sincerely hope they are in a position to deliver what they know they have to carry out to get the Grand Prix in 2010. Though the amount increases on a sliding scale year on year, Silverstone is still getting the British Grand Prix on the cheap until 2009.         
	The problem for Britain and the traditional hosts in Europe is the vast amounts that emerging economies like China and India, who debut in 2010, are prepared to pay with state funds  at least double the Silverstone rate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Laxman double hundred adds to the Aussie woes
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Laxman double hundred adds to the Aussie woes
    - India declare at 613 for seven; Gambhir brings up maiden 200           JAYDEEP BASU                            
	New Delhi: The languid elegance of V.V.S. Laxman buried the Australians under an avalanche of runs at the Kotla on Thursday. Gautam Gambhir too made the most with a maiden double century but it was Laxman who shone the brightest.         
	Resuming at the overnight score of 296 for three, India continued to torment the Aussie attack with clinical shot-making and finally declared at 613 for seven, 75 minutes after tea when Laxman (200 not out) completed the second double century of his Test career.         
	In reply, the Australians were 50 for no loss when the stumps were drawn. Matthew Hayden (16) and Simon Katich (29) were at the crease.         
	Australian vice-captain Michael Clarke said on Wednesday that his team would like to make the best use of the new ball in the pre-lunch session on the second day. In reality, their pace bowlers could hardly make an impact as Gambhir and Laxman hit them all over the ground to score almost at will.         
	The two Indian batsmen, who shared a fourth wicket partnership of 278 runs, frustrated the Australian bowlers on a pitch that looked perfect for batting but was expected to help the spinners from the third day onwards.         
	So pronounced was Indias batting domination that the Australian bowlers had to toil hard for 72 overs before they could taste their first success after Sachin Tendulkar was dismissed during the post-lunch session on the opening day.         
	If Gambhir was the star attraction on the opening day, it was the turn of Laxman to play the dominant role in the morning session on Thursday. Starting at 54 not out, the right hander from Hyderabad played some breathtaking shots to race to his 13th Test hundred, minutes before the umpires called for lunch. It was also his sixth century against the Australians, who had always found him hard to contain.         
	Laxman, who is set to play his 100th Test match in Nagpur in a few days from now, was in a fiery mood and didnt spare any bowler. He was at his best in the first hour when the condition was demanding. During this period, the lanky right hander hit six boundaries, the best being a pull off Mitchell Johnson that hit the fence like a rocket.         
	It was indeed a great innings from an elegant batsman, who always rises to the occasion against stronger teams in Test cricket. Not for once throughout the day could he be bogged down by any of the eight Australian bowlers, including their exasperated captain Ricky Ponting. Laxman finally got his double hundred when he sprinted for a brace after lofting a Michael Clarke delivery to mid-on.         
	Laxman, who had always been Australias perennial thorn in the flesh, said he was determined to do well in this Test.         
	It was unfortunate that I was not able to contribute in the first and the second Test. It was very important for us to get a big first innings score here so that we could put pressure on the Australians.         
	Gambhir (206), on the other hand, was less flamboyant but did not squander the opportunity to score his first double century in Test cricket. He also achieved the feat in the pre-lunch session but unlike the first hundred runs, the next 100 came on a mild pace. He flicked a ball from Brett Lee past Mike Hussey to reach the 200 mark.         
	The Australian attack looked truly hapless despite the fact that they could polish off three quick wickets in the Indian middle order in the post-lunch session. The fact remains that all the three Indian batsmen threw away their wickets.         
	Gambhirs approach indicated his tiredness when he dragged a Watson delivery on to his stumps to end his 380-ball innings. Sourav Gangulys was a soft dismissal as he offered a catch to Ponting at short cover off Simon Katich.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who led India to victory in Mohali, went for everything that was pitched up to him and was finally caught behind off Watson.

	Shanghai: McLarens Lewis Hamilton gave his Formula One title hopes a huge boost when he took pole position for the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday with his main rival Felipe Massa of Ferrari qualifying third.         
	The 23-year-old Briton, who could become Formula Ones youngest world champion if he wins Sundays penultimate race of the season and Massa finishes lower than fourth, will line up alongside world champion Kimi Raikkonen on the front row.         
	BMW-Saubers Robert Kubica, the third driver still in title contention albeit 12 points behind Hamilton, scraped into the second qualifying session but failed to reach the final shootout and will start 11th on the grid.         
	His McLaren teammate Heikki Kovalainen will lead off the third row from fifth place alongside Toro Rossos Sebastian Vettel, who moved up to sixth after BMW-Saubers Nick Heidfeld was docked three places for impeding Red Bulls David Coulthard.         
	Red Bulls Mark Webber pulled off the track with his car on fire during the mornings final practice and suffered a 10-place penalty for an unscheduled engine change. That relegated the Australian from sixth to 16th.         
	Force Indias Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella will once again start from the rear of the grid as they finished 19th and 20th, respectively.         
	Force India are the only team not to have got a point in the current season and this puts even more pressure on the two drivers to perform well at the Shanghai International Circuit.         
	German Sutil clocked 1:37.730 as his best timing in the nine laps he finished while his Italian teammate Fisichella was just 0.09 seconds behind.         
	Although both demonstrated an improved pace from their morning practice times, they found the grip level much reduced in the afternoon and struggled to find a comfortable balance in the first qualifying segment.         
	The balance changed quite a lot in qualifying. Normally you would always find grip, but this time the level was lower and so under braking I had lots of oversteer and locking at the rear and the traction was very bad everywhere, which made it quite difficult to do a perfect lap, Sutil said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania Mirza upsets fifth seed 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sania Mirza upsets fifth seed 
                      
	New Delhi: Indian Ace Sania Mirza shocked fifth seed Flavia Pennetta in straight sets to advance to the second round of the $175,000 Ordina Open in Shertogenbosh, Netherlands on Monday.         
	Sania shrugged off her disappointing first match loss at DFS Classic last week and went all out against her Italian opponent to register a convincing 6-4, 6-3 win in one hour and 12 minutes in the first round.         
	Both the players offered chances to each other as the match witnessed lot of breaks.         
	Sania broke Pennetta, the world No. 23, four times in the first set and dropped her serve thrice.         
	In the second set, the Indian raced to a 5-1 lead after breaking Pennetta in the second, fourth and sixth games. Pennetta tried to stage a comeback by breaking Sania in the seventh and holding her own in the eighth but the Indian quickly served out the match in the next to move to the next stage.         
	Sania next plays winners of the match between local favourite Michaella Krajicek and Japanese Ai Sugiyama.         
	Meanwhile, Sanias disastrous return to court, after a three-month injury layoff, last week had no impact on her WTA rankings as she held on to the 33rd spot in the latest list released on Monday.         
	However, Sania gained a spot to be 19th in the doubles rankings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SSP makes US debut today
                                                     SSP makes US debut today
                  S.S.P. Chowrasia                     
	Doral: S.S.P. Chowrasia and Jeev Milkha Singh will be the Indian presence at the elite WGC-CA Championship that begins here on Thursday.         
	Chowrasia, who will be playing on the US PGA Tour for the first time, has been teamed with Korean K.J. Choi and Henrik Stenson of Sweden while Jeev will have Retief Goosen and Sean Hair for company in the first two rounds.         
	Last months Indian Masters triumph catapulted Chowrasia into the top 10 of the European Tour Order of Merit, earning him a berth in the prestigious event. Now Chowrasia, the son of a former greens keeper at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club, will find himself in elite company, headlined by world No. 1 Tiger Woods.         
	Jeev has twice let the silverware slip through his fingers this season, including the play-off defeat at the Ballantines Championship in South Korea last weekend.         
	Jeev, who finished tied 28th last season, however, believes his game is good enough to challenge the best in the business. Im looking forward to Doral now because Im playing well, he said at the weekend. So maybe, theres something better waiting for me there.         
	Close friend Daniel Chopra will also be in the mix and the Swede of Indian origin has been teamed with Jim Furyk and James Kingston in the first two rounds of the $8 million event.         
	Other Asian Tour stars in the fray include last seasons Order of Merit winner Liang Wen-Chong of China, Thailands Chapchai Nirat, South Africans Anton Haig and James Kingston and current Order of Merit leader Mark Brown of New Zealand.         
	Liang has been drawn to play in the first two rounds alongside Sergio Garcia and Graeme Storm while Haig will play with US Open champion Angel Cabrera.         
	All eyes will also be on Brown, who hit a purple patch last month by winning back-to-back titles at the Sail Open and Johnnie Walker Classic. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A mere 91 minutes is all it took
                                                                                                                                                                                                     A mere 91 minutes is all it took
            SUDIPTO GANGULY                      
	Mohali: Zaheer Khan made the Australian lower order dance to his tune on Tuesday morning to complete the formalities as India won by their biggest margin against the World Champions in the second Test of the series.         
	India needed just 91 minutes on day five to beat the mighty Australians by a monumental 320 runs, their biggest after the 222-run win in Melbourne (December, 1977), to go 1-0 up in the four-Test series.         
	The Australians could muster only 195 in their second innings in 64.4 overs.         
	A lot of credit for the Indian aggression should definitely go to captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who handled the team full with seniors brilliantly. Dhoni was also adjudged the Man of the Match for his useful knocks in both innings.         
	Zaheer picked up three wickets in four balls to ensure there would be no slip-up from the home side. His spell of 7-2-27-3 in the morning sent away the remotest hopes of an Australian survival to the oblivion.         
	He sneaked through Brad Haddins (37) defence with the sixth ball of the day. The ball came in a bit after pitching and was enough to go through the gate to uproot Haddins middle stump.         
	Haddins wicket was the last nail in the coffin, as the Australians were banking on the partnership between the wicketkeeper and Michael Clarke for a miracle. Haddin and Clarke could add only a single to their overnight stand of 83.         
	In the very next over, Zaheer induced an edge from Cameron White to pick up his second wicket. Captain Dhoni dived full length on his right to take a smart catch.         
	The very next ball Zaheer pegged back Brett Lees off-stump to be on a hattrick. The ball pitched on middle and leg and left Lee to fox him completely.         
	Lee couldnt repeat the heroics of the first innings when he made 35.         
	Mitchell Johnson walked in next at the fall of Lees wicket, and was able to deny Zaheer the hattrick.         
	Johnson then staved off the inevitable with a 50-run ninth wicket partnership with Clarke. He offered a simple return catch to leg-spinner Amit Mishra, playing early to a turning delivery.         
	Clarke, who made a decent 69, was the last man to fall for the visitors. He became Mishras second victim of the innings  seventh in the match. He tried to pull the leg-spinner but ended into the safe hands of Virender Sehwag at mid-wicket. The fall of Clarke started the celebrations for the Indians.         
	Sachin Tendulkar  for overtaking Brian Lara as the highest rungetter  and Sourav Ganguly  for playing his last Test at Mohali  were both presented mementos by the Punjab Cricket Association. The joy of winning the Test was dampened a little though with Zaheers fine.         
	Dhoni also showed his respect for former captain Sourav, by offering him a stump as a memento.         
	Signs of a happy Indian cricket family for sure.

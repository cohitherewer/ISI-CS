The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need to keep up spirit: Bhutia
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Need to keep up spirit: Bhutia
                      
	Hyderabad: India captain Bhaichung Bhutia on Tuesday said his team was determined to keep up the never-say-die attitude to emerge triumphant in the AFC Challenge Cup.         
	Bhutia said what stood out was the sides great character in the three matches they have played so far. He is also aware that they will have to keep it up in the semi-final and the final to emerge winners.         
	India take on Myanmar while North Korea play Tajikistan in the semi-finals on Thursday in Asias second tier inter-nation competition whose winners qualify for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.         
	We have shown great character and team spirit in the three matches, nobody gave up till the end. We have to keep up that never-say-die attitude as this is such an important tournament. I dont need to say this, every player knows it, said Bhutia who scored a brace against formidable Turkmensitan on Sunday to see India through to the semi-finals.         
	We might not have played beautiful football given the conditions (of the ground), but we played effective football. I think that is important, it is not necessary that we play beautiful football all the time, he said.         
	Bhutia said any of the four semi-finalists can win the tournament and India cant take Myanmar lightly on Thursday.         
	Myanmar are a good team, they are technically good and they play hard game. So, we cant take them lightly. We want to win but it will not be easy, he said.         
	Asked about the difficulties in playing on slushy surfaces, Bhutia said he was used to the conditions but felt scared as most of his teammates are not used to playing in such conditions.         
	I am used to playing in such conditions in Calcutta but other players are not used to... I was scared of them especially youngsters Gouramangi Singh and Anwar Ali, but fortunately everybody came through and there was no injury, said the 32-year-old.         
	On his personal achievement, he was looking for a triumph in this tournament.         
	I wont say it would be the best achievement as for me winning any tournament for the country is a big thing. But yes, winning this tournament would be one of the high points in my career, he said.         
	Bhutia was all praise for his best friend Rennedy Singh for his consistency and fine form in the match against Turkmenistan.         
	Rennedy has been very consistent for India throughout his international career. He has been a disciplined player he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Portugal look to their Superman
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Portugal look to their Superman
            Patrick Barclay            Cristiano Ronaldo                           
	After two successive English titles, each accompanied by a footballer-of-the-year award, and now a Champions League medal, it can safely be said that Cristiano Ronaldo has conquered the European club scene; now for the international stage. Manchester United having temporarily relinquished their Superman  as Ronaldos compatriot Carlos Queiroz, assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, has described him with utterly permissible exaggeration  all that matters is Portugal.         
	Not that Ronaldo has much to prove to his country. Even as a 19-year-old, four years ago, he contributed much to a European Championship on home soil; remember how Ashley Cole was lauded for keeping him relatively quiet in the thrilling Lisbon quarter final England lost on penalties?         
	Ronaldo went on to score against Holland in the semi-finals and, although Greece were to deny the Portuguese the trophy, the consolation was that Luis Figo had been replaced. Ronaldo confirmed that impression in the 2006 World Cup.         
	After guaranteeing himself a trial by tabloid with the sly wink that betrayed his pleasure with Wayne Rooneys dismissal after a tangle with Ricardo Carvalho, he put away what proved the concluding penalty of another quarter final decider with the Eng-lish.         
	So, after a final and a semi the challenge is to go all the way in the last tournament of Luiz Felipe Scolaris already most respectable reign. To say that much depends on Ronaldo would be to understate the obvious.         
	Of all the extraordinary aspects of the ultra-confident young Madeiran, one of the least noted is his ability repeatedly to play almost year-round without appearing to suffer from the fatigue, or at least staleness, to which so much is ascribed in the modern game).         
	While his English clubmates take a well-earned holiday, Ronaldo will accordingly be expected to start a fresh campaign by tormenting the Turks to distraction in Geneva next Saturday night.         
	Next will come a piquant reunion with Petr Cech, of the Czech Republic and Chelsea, who, after Ronaldo had given United the lead in Moscow with a majestic header, seemed to have condemned his rival to agonised frustration by saving his penalty in the Champions League decider  until Edwin van der Sar came to the rescue.         
	Perhaps this offers the Czechs the prospect of a slight psychological advantage should Ronaldo be asked to step up to the spot.         
	But, as their splendid goalkeeper recently implied, this is not much of a gap to pick out in his otherwise formidable armour.                       THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

                                                   Pataudi pulls up Aussie media 

           
	Mumbai: Former Test captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi on Monday rubbished Australian media reports which termed the Indian cricket team as the worst-behaved, saying it was on the contrary a very well-behaved outfit. 
    
	The Indian team, by and large, are well behaved. They may not be as passive as during our times with the youngsters giving back as well as they get (verbally) on the field, Pataudi said. 
    
	A Sydney-based newspaper on Sunday used the International Cricket Council (ICC) data to claim that Indian cricketers were the worst-behaved, facing action in 43 cases, the maximum for any team. Then is Pakistan with 39 cases followed South Africa with 27 and Australia 25 penalties by the ICC since 1997. 
    
	Anil has handled it in a dignified and mature manner. He has done an excellent job and the cricket board has backed the team as its expected to, the former India skipper said. 
    
	Pataudi hoped that the ICC would eventually come out in a transparent manner about the happenings during the hearing on Harbhajan Singhs alleged remarks to Andrew Symonds that has led to a three-Test ban on the Indian spinner. 
    
	I hope the ICC will come out with more details after the Harbhajan Singh-appeal hearing. I dont think the whole story has come out yet. It seems to be a one-sided version, Pataudi said. 
    
	Meanwhile former West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding has slammed the Australian team as one of the worst behaved in world cricket due to their excessive appealing. I wont pinpoint the exact teams. But Australia isnt far from the top for poor behaviour, Holding was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper. 
    
	He felt that as world champions, the Australians needed to set the standard in on-field conduct as well. Australia is the No. 1 team and as such they should be setting the benchmark for the spirit in how the game is played, Holding added. (PTI)

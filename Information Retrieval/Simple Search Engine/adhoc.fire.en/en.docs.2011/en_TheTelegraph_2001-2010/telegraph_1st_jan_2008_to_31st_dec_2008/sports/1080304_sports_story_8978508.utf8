                                                   Being consistent is a part of my life, says Hayden

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL Because of spinners, playing India physically more demanding: Aussie star 
   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
                 
	Brisbane: The past week has seen Matthew Hayden make the headlines for all the wrong reasons, but in the midst of all that he still top-scored for Australia in the tri-series first final, on Sunday. 
    
	The 36-year-old, clearly, has been an outstanding performer (8,242 runs and 30 hundreds in Tests; 6,078 runs and 10 hundreds in ODIs) and Australia will struggle to get a suitable replacement once he calls it quits. 
    
	Hayden, who spoke to The Telegraph, didnt take questions on the recent controversies. Brisbane, incidentally, is the champion batsmans home town. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
    
	On his appetite for runs continuing to grow 
    
	(Grins) Ive really been enjoying my cricket The fact that Ive played over a period of time has allowed me the freedom to express myself Longevity has given me that benefit 
    
	Preparing in the most thorough manner possible 
    
	Yeah, I like doing that Ive been enjoying the process and, over the years, my preparation has got better When you start off, you neither really know your game nor do you know yourself You can, of course, never prepare for a great ball If youre experienced, then your response to getting out on such a ball would be different than if you were an absolute rookie or somebody still new to international cricket. 
    
	Whether experience makes it easier to handle those moments when the going isnt good 
    
	Lets say its less painful With experience you dont get too concerned about every little thing. 
    
	The secret behind his phenomenal consistency 
    
	Ive maintained my passion for the game Ive probably increased my level of fitness and am perhaps more aware of my body now That I still had to miss the Perth Test (in January) is what made it all the more disappointing Its because Im enjoying the game that my mindset has remained positive and Ive looked forward to the challenges, both personal and those confronting the team. Being consistent is a part of my life. 
    
	Whether he had to reinvent himself as a one-day cricketer after being excluded from ODIs not too long ago 
    
	Not at all Because at no point then did I think I was out of nick or that my non-selection was justified I didnt dwell on my exclusion too much because I was confident an opportunity would come again Sheer self-belief got me through that period as also having good people around me who ensured that I stayed on the right path One of those was the captain, Ricky Ponting, who wanted me back in the team and who saw me as somebody who added value. 
    
	The role of a senior pro like him 
    
	My role has changed immensely, especially after the 2001 tour of India Till then, I was just trying to hold down my spot In more recent years Ive seen myself as an integral part of the senior players group My leadership role will, I suppose, continue till the end of my career. 
    
	Whether hes disappointed at not having got the Australia captaincy 
    
	No Thats an honest answer. 
    
	Defining moment in his career 
    
	The 2001 series in India (549 runs in the three-Test series) Thats when I really made my presence felt on the stage... I got to play a role in the ODIs too On the negative side, a defining moment would be the 2005 Ashes in England I didnt have to reinvent the wheel, though As it turned out, I found momentum in the home summer of 2005-06 and got big runs. (After a pause) Actually, all defining moments havent really had everything to do with on-field performances. 
    
	On being religious 
    
	Theres a gentle guidance in whatever we do in life and, through this journey, Ive tried to be the best person I can be Its a journey that Ive enjoyed and, hopefully, Ive been able to influence people in a positive manner Following the teachings of Christ has been a humbling experience Amongst all the people whove walked this earth, some have stood out (Mahatma) Gandhi, for example He may not be a prophet, but there are valuable lessons to be learnt from people like him Nelson Mandela too. The faith of a person isnt important, its the moral direction he gives which is. 
    
	Having authored books on cuisine 
    
	(Laughs) You may not believe it, but home-cooked yellow dal is one of my favourites and there are Indian recipes in my books If I could add, my wifes favourite meal is steamed rice and dal Ive been fascinated by the incredibly varied cooking network, so to say, in India Indeed, if Im not at nets on tours there, youll probably find me in the hotel kitchens! 
    
	Feasting on the Indian attack too 
    
	Ive enjoyed the battles Because of the spinners, playing India is physically more demanding The challenge is to do well on the fourth afternoon of a Test in India 
    
	What made the Matthew Hayden-Justin Langer partnership tick 
    
	Theres much thats common to our lives Weve shared the same values, the same principles Ricky fitted into our partnership too, in that if I got out early then Justin would enjoy batting with him and if Justin got out early then I enjoyed batting with Ricky That Justin and I have such respect for each other made us bond even better on the field The character bit came into play as well I knew that if I was in the trenches with Justin and Ricky, theyd be providing cover for my back. Likewise from my side. 
    
	The values he holds dear 
    
	Having an excellent work ethic Seeing the brighter side of things Enjoying the success of other people 
    
	Whether theres an ideal mind-set for an opener 
    
	Theres certainly an ideal mind-set for Matthew Hayden Im purely occupied in watching the ball If Im thinking of something else, then Ive left something to chance in my preparation. 
    
	On most of the focus in recent years having been on the Sachin Tendulkars and the Brian Laras when hes himself registered 30 Test hundreds 
    
	My profile probably flies under the radar a little bit, but I really dont mind it I dont play cricket to have a huge PR wagon behind me Bottomline is that I enjoy this game and am always challenged by it. I try and extract the most out of my abilities and am happy doing so. 
    
	Favourite innings 
    
	The 380 in the Perth Test against Zimbabwe (2003-04) It had been pure batting from the time I stepped on to the park There are a few really (After a pause) I quite liked the way I batted in the entire 2007 World Cup (highest scorer with 659 runs) I was on fire from the first ball and I love the West Indies Love being close to water The sea, the ocean 
    
	Is there something that remains to be learnt 
    
	Theres nothing glaringly obvious which needs to be learnt. However, having said that, theres something to be learnt every single day. 
    
	Finally, the legacy hell be leaving once he decides to go the Adam Gilchrist way 
    
	(Emotionally) Its going to be somebody elses call Hopefully, Ill be remembered as somebody who was passionate and played entertaining cricket Hopefully, Ill be remembered as somebody who could deliver both at home and overseas Ive been around for 15 years and longevity in the time of competition is an achievement Ill be there till the time Im enjoying the game I love it so much that Ill find it hard to let it go But I do realise one has to be realistic I reckon Ill know when its time to go

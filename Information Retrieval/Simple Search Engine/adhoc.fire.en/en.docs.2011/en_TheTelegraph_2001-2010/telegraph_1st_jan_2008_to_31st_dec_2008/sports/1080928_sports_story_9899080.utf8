The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rest clinch Irani 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rest clinch Irani 
                      
	Vadodara: Gautam Gambhir (91) stood tall amid ruins but his teammates could not show the same belligerent obduracy as Rest of India trampled Delhi by 187 runs to lift the Irani Trophy with more than a day to spare at the IPCL Stadium here Saturday.         
	Seven wickets separated Anil Kumbles men from an imminent win while Delhi pinned its hopes on Gambhir to score another 268 runs for an improbable victory. In the end, the miracle Delhi needed never happened and Rest of India shot down the Ranji champions at 190 in their second innings.         
	After his defiant 176-ball knock, which had 12 fours in it, Gambhir at least returned with the satisfaction that he didnt let his team down. The same, however, could not be said of his teammates, who made a meek capitulation in the face of adversity.         
	It was not those kind of wickets where you go out and play your shots. It was quite difficult and I think the 75-run first innings lead proved crucial in the end, Kumble said.         
	Rest of India were decidedly better in fielding as well, pulling off some stunning catches over the last four days.         
	Oh yes, catches win matches and it was a great fielding effort by the side. We managed really some extraordinary catches which made a lot of difference, he asserted.         
	Gambhir waged a grim battle, flaying the Rest of India attack even though his teammates kept coming and going at the other end. He ran down Zaheer Khan through the slips and walked cut fiercely to add salt to the wound.         
	Gambhir also walked out to thrash Munaf Patel through on-side and then disdainfully hit R.P. Singh .         
	All along, his partners kept changing at the other end.         
	Aakash Chopra, who did not open on Friday after having twisted his ankle, took the field with Virat Kohli in tow as his runner. But the gritty right-hander returned with a golden duck against his name, dragging the first ball he faced, from Zaheer, onto the stumps.         
	Veteran of many a battle, Mithun Manhas (12) wanted to leave Harbhajan Singhs first delivery of the day but the ball kissed the blade and flew to Rahul Dravid at slip.         
	Meanwhile, Munaf Patel was fined 75 per cent of his match fee for abusing Delhi captain Virender Sehwag during the Irani Trophy.         
	Match Referee R.R. Jadeja refused to disclose the fine but it was learnt that Munaf was docked 75 per cent of his match fee.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Boonen out after cocaine bust
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Boonen out after cocaine bust
                      
	Paris: Former cycling world champion Tom Boonen has been barred from this years Tour de France after testing positive for cocaine. The rest of his Quick Step team can still compete, tour organisers said.         
	But Wednesdays decision meant two of the top contenders are now out of the prestigious race  Belgiums Boonen, who earned the green jersey as the best sprinter in last years tour and 2007 winner Alberto Contador.         
	The drug accusations against Boonen are an attack on the integrity of the image of the Tour de France, race director Christian Prudhomme said after the decision.         
	He being an emblematic world champion should set an example, Prudhomme said. I told him that for us, he could not be there for the start of the race in three weeks if what has been announced turns out to be true.

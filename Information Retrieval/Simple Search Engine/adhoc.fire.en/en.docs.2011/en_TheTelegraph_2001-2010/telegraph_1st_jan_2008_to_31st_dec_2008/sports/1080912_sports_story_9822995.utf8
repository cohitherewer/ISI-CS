	London: Brazil were held goalless at home by 10-man Bolivia in a World Cup qualifier played in front of a half empty stadium in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday.         
	The result will put more pressure on beleaguered coach Dunga, who was given a brief respite when his team beat Chile 3-0 away on Sunday.         
	Miroslav Klose also hit a hattrick for Germany but his goals only salvaged a 3-3 draw for a side who were just seven minutes from losing to Finland for the first time in 85 years.         
	Most of the other teams expected to reach the 2010 World Cup in South Africa came through the second round of qualifiers in five days unscathed. World champions Italy beat Georgia 2-0 in Udine and World Cup runners-up France beat Serbia 2-1 in Paris.         
	European champions Spain maintained their perfect start in Group 5 with a 4-0 win over Armenia in Albacete.         
	Argentina were denied their first win in five qualifiers when Peru scored with the last kick of the game to force a 1-1 draw. Argentina survived a torrid spell of second-half pressure and then snatched the lead with an Esteban Cambiasso goal in the 83rd minute.         
	However, Johan Fano slid in the equaliser after a stunning 70-metre run by Juan Vargas in the fourth minute of injury time. The draw kept Argentina third in the 10-team South American group, level on 13 points with Brazil and Chile and four behind leaders Paraguay. Peru remained ninth with seven points.         
	There was an amazing finale in Lisbon where Denmark beat Portugal 3-2 with four of the five goals in the match scored between the 83rd minute and the second minute of stoppage time.         
	Nani put Portugal ahead after 42 minutes, Nicklas Bendtner made it 1-1 after 83 minutes before Deco put Portugal ahead with an 86th minute penalty. Christian Poulsen equalised after 89 minutes before Daniel Jensen won it for the Danes in the second minute of stoppage time.         
	The one major shock was in Zurich where Euro 2008 co-hosts Switzerland lost 1-2 to Luxembourg, ranked 152nd in the world.         
	Bosnia scored the biggest win of the night, crushing Estonia 7-0, but the Czech Republic, ranked eighth in the world, failed to convince on a rainy night in Belfast and were held to a 0-0 draw by Northern Ireland.         
	The Netherlands, who went out of Euro 2008 at the quarter-final stage after a brilliant start to the competition, opened their campaign with a 2-1 win over Macedonia in Skopje. John Heitinga and Rafael van der Vaart got the goals.         
	The most impressive performance in the 25 European qualifiers came from England in Zagreb, the scene of a painful 2-0 defeat to Croatia nearly two years ago. Croatia also beat England 3-2 at Wembley in November to end their hopes of reaching the European championship in June.         
	Italy, who beat Cyprus 2-1 away on Saturday, scored a second successive win in Group 8 by beating Georgia 2-0 in Udine, Daniele De Rossi scoring twice.         
	France got their first points in Group 7 following Saturdays shock 1-3 defeat by Austria, beating Serbia 2-1 in Paris with goals from Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka.         
	Despite their draw in Finland, Germany still top Group 4, a point ahead of Russia and Wales.         
	Russia opened their campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Wales in Moscow, though the Euro 2008 semi-finalists left it late with Pavel Pogrebnyak lashing home the winner nine minutes from time.         
	Greece, who won 2-0 in Latvia, have maximum points and top Group 2 while Lithuania, 2-0 winners over Austria, also have a 100 per cent record and top Group 7.         
	The United States maintained their 100 per cent record in World Cup qualifying with 3-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds was hurt, says author Ricky Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Symonds was hurt, says author Ricky Ponting
                      
	Melbourne: After former wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist created quite a stir with his revelations about the infamous Sydney Test in his book, it is the turn of skipper Ricky Ponting to offer his take on the racism row that shook world cricket.         
	In his Captains Diary 2008: A season of Tests, Turmoil and Twenty20, Ponting defended Andrew Symonds, who had accused Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh of racially abusing him, and said the allrounder was genuinely hurt by what had been hurled at him.         
	The Australian skipper said when he heard Michael Clarke yell across to him at the SCG about Harbhajan Singh, Hes done it again ... he just called Symmo a monkey again, he was just rooted to the ground.         
	I wouldnt say (Clarkes) words sent a chill up my spine or anything that sinister, but they certainly stopped me in my tracks, Ponting recounted.         
	(I thought) Ive got to act on it. I talked to Symmo, to get his version ... then I went over and told umpire Mark Benson what we believed had just gone on, and I asked him to do something about it.

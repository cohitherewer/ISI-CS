	Calcutta: Team India captain and Man-of-the-Match Mahendra Singh Dhoni looked a relieved man in the post-match presentation ceremony, after making sure that his team reached the Asia Cup final.               
	Following are excerpts:         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni         
	Its a good win for our side We wanted to bowl well today (Thursday). It was great to see R.P. (Singh), Ishant (Sharma) and Pragyan (Ojha) bowl well. Viru (Virender Sehwag) and Gauti (Gautam Gambhir) again gave us a good start today We finished well. We were right up there today (Thursday), though we were a bit tired. Our batting was not only about hitting boundaries today. Sehwag and Gautam also ran very well I was telling Suresh (Raina) if we put pressure on the fielders, we will get couples We dont need to hit boundaries. We would like to improve a bit in the fielding department and also in bowling. We have a couple of days off now thankfully Looking forward to a good game of cricket in the final.

	The wicket was pretty good They got away from us in the first 10-15 overs. Rainas catch became very vital. There was no question of complacency We went flat out, we played to our plan. The Indians batted really well

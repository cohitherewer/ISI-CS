                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Glory steals the thunder 
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Steal The Glory does it again, beating an equally quality field this time in the 1,400m Gamble For Love Cup, Wednesdays main event. Apprentice Amandeep Singh also rode a well-judged race, setting the 5-2 fancy, behind his stablemate, Right Again, till the home turn and stealing a march over the field thereafter.          
	The apprentice, however, failed to do the full justice to his hot-favourite Fabulous Emperor in the Annihilator Cup. Almost trailing the field, the Emperor found Arti Doctor-trained Apostrophe (D. Ashish-up) a hard nut to crack.

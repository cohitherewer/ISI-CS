The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wont let up, says Yusuf
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wont let up, says Yusuf
    - chasing mammoth total, Team India come a cropper in last lap           INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Yusuf Pathan                                 
	Dhaka: Yusuf Pathan got his international career to a great start with a six in the first over of World Twenty20 final at the Wanderers. The 25-year-old continued his Twenty20 form in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL)  435 runs with four fifties at a strike rate of 179  for Rajasthan Royals.         
	Success, though, hasnt been smooth in one-day Internationals. Yusuf, promised to fulfil the expectations during a free-wheeling chat with The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The start to his one-day career         
	My performance has been average The start hasnt been very encouraging... But I am confident things will fall into place and I will be able to meet expectations. There will be no let up in my efforts Baki sab Allah ke hath mein.         
	If he deserved the break early on         
	That is up to the selectors. I cannot do much about it.         
	On what kept him going after being overlooked by the selectors         
	Ive always believed my job is to perform and my time will come. I kept performing in the domestic circuit. Every match, be it domestic or international, is a big motivation. That keeps me going.         
	Playing with Irfan (the second after the Amarnath brothers to play for India)         
	Not just Irfan, I enjoy playing with everyone. Be it on the field or off it, my teammates always help me to perform better. Ive played along with Irfan from an early age and its nothing new Too much is being read into it. I realise its significant in the context of international cricket, but to me, its no great feeling. We get along well Having him around on tours mean we can go out together for namaaz on Fridays or for some other common cause But make no mistake, my teammates are as close and dear to me as Irfan.         
	If the Pathans dream to make it big like the Chappell and the Waugh brothers         
	I think its too early to talk about such big names They are legends in their own right. We obviously want to make a name for ourselves and that would be a huge achievement if the dream comes true But Ive just started my career and would first want to concentrate on cementing my place in the side. The rest will follow         
	The secret of success in the IPL         
	Its not that I performed only in the IPL. Ive doing well in the domestic circuit too for the last couple of years. Its only that I drew much attention after the IPL. Maybe because of the presence of so stars in the tournament         
	Playing under Shane Warnes captaincy and coaching for Rajasthan Royals         
	He is a great in his own right but a very humble person. His presence and approach makes a huge difference. He didnt change our game but stressed on everyone playing their natural game He gelled well with the side and the results are there for everyone to see.         
	His idol         
	Sachin Tendulkar and others Personally, playing with Sachin has been a big thing. Kapil Dev is also someone whom I admire Most of I t was watching him on TV during the growing up years         
	His best cricketing moment so far         
	Obviously playing the final and being part of the World Twenty20 team. Nothing can match it The IPL success will fade in comparison. The feeling is entirely different when you are representing the country.         
	His target         
	To improve and perform in international cricket Everything else will fall into place.

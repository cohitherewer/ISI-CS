The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan need to pull up socks
                                                                                                                                                                                           Bagan need to pull up socks
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan would be looking for a fresh start when they face Air India in a do-or-die match in group D of the ongoing 30th Federation Cup.         
	With Air India on four points and both Mohun Bagan and Vasco on three each, Tuesday will witness the three teams go all out for a semi-final berth in the Federation Cup.         
	Jose Ramirez Barreto, Bhaichung Bhutia and P.C. Lalawmpuiya skipped practice on Monday but coach Karim Bencharifa said this was to give their star-performers much-needed rest.         
	They need some rest. They are playing at a stretch and so the decision to allow them a breather, Karim said.         
	Admitting that the team is under tremendous pressure to deliver, the Moroccan coach said: After such a good comeback in the I-League expectations have gone high. We know that, and yes, there is a bit of pressure to deliver.         
	Though the Brazilian Barreto started on the bench in Bagans last match against Vasco, things are not clear about his availability against Air India.         
	In that case Bhutia will be partnered by Lalwampuiya upfront. The mid-field will be patrolled by Rakesh Masih, James Singh (Sr.), Ishfaq Ahmed and Marcos Pereira while the defence line is likely to be manned by Habibur Rehman Mondal (right-back), Mohanraj (left-back) with the two stoppers Deepak Mondal and Anand Vasan.

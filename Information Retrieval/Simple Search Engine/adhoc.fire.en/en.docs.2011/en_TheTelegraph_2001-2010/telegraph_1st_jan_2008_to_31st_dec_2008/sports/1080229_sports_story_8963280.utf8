The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians look to keep up momentum
                                                   Australians look to keep up momentum
                      
	Melbourne: Australia will be eager to maintain their momentum for the best-of-three finals against India when they take on Sri Lanka in an inconsequential tri-series match here on Friday.         
	The islanders though have nothing but pride at stake.         
	The finals will begin in Sydney on Sunday and it is possible that the hosts would rest some of their key players for the day-night contest.         
	Australia have won their last four matches in the tri-series and would look to iron out some of their vulnerabilities.         
	They would also seek to put the controversies about poor player behaviour behind them after another acrimonious week which saw opener Matthew Hayden launch a scathing verbal attack against Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma.         
	Australia are treating the game with all seriousness.         
	Weve certainly taken the approach that our finals campaign starts now, retiring wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist said on Thursday.         
	You could say it would be better not playing the game and have a clear run into the finals and preparation. But weve got this game to use how we want to use it and its not as a practice game. If we get lethargic we lose momentum, Gilchrist said.         
	It would be up to the players on how they want to approach the game, he said.         
	Im sure everybody is looking to fine tune their form. Im sure Ricky (Ponting) and Symmo (Andrew Symonds) will want to back up now the runs that theyve scored. Ive had a few 10s, 20s since my hundred in Perth, so it would be nice to get a bit of momentum.         
	Australia lost the tri-series finals to England last season and would be keen to win the tournament the last time it is played. We dont have that trophy in our cabinet and its the last tri-series that there will probably ever be.         
	Its been an integral part in the success of Australian cricket and the Australian cricket calendar, and indeed the world cricket calendar. Countries used to covet this trophy and loved to be here, Gilchrist said.         
	The fact that left-arm wrist spinner Brad Hogg will join the retirement bandwagon after the competition could also inspire the Australians to give a winning farewell to the tweaker.         
	Sri Lanka have lost four consecutive games since beating India in Canberra more than two weeks ago and Jayawardene wants his team to finish the series on a high.         
	No team wants to lose four-five games in a tournament and not have a successful run. Every game we play, we play to win and give everything. Things havent gone our way, we have one more chance to rectify those things, the Lankan captain said.         
	Left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson will return after missing the game against India in Sydney last Sunday while Sri Lanka may rest Farveez Mahroof, who has a side strain.

            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Martin Crowe                           
	Calcutta: Former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe, whod flayed the Black Caps current coach John Bracewell in these columns last week, hasnt exactly been impressed by his decision to not seek an extension once his contract ends next April.         
	Hes leaving, yes, but only at the end of his contract in 2009, Crowe, the Bangalore Royal Challengers chief cricket officer, told The Telegraph.         
	Asked whether more damage would be done by then, Crowe replied rather bitingly: More damage? Id never kick a man when hes going         
	Among other things, in an interview last week, Crowe had said: Weve been getting exposed ever since Bracewell became the coach.         
	Crowe had also slammed Bracewell for curbing Stephen Flemings flair as captain.         
	He was a brilliant tactician for some years from 2000, till Bracewell became the coach Till Bracewell came on the scene in late 2003 and completely swamped Fleming Bracewells style is abrasive and hes had such a negative influence.         
	Had Crowe been in a position to influence New Zealand Cricket, Bracewell wouldve been shown the door quite some time ago.

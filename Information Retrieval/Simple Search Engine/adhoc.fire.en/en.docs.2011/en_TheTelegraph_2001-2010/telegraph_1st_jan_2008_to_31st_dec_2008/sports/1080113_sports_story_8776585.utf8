                                                    Seniors agree to play with a rider

  - President Pawar directs joint-secretary Pandove to head for Perth

	Calcutta: The Team India seniors have, for now, agreed to continue with the ongoing Test series in Australia but will make themselves unavailable for next months tri-series if the Harbhajan Singh issue isnt satisfactorily resolved by then. 
    
	Thats the understanding reached between the seniors and the Board president, Sharad Pawar, whod asked them to have faith in him and the Board, a top source told The Telegraph on Saturday evening. 
    
	The Test series ends in Adelaide on January 28 and Indias first match in the tri-series (with Sri Lanka being the third team), against Australia, is in Brisbane on February 3. 
    
	Its almost certain that Harbhajans appeal isnt going to be heard by the International Cricket Council (ICC)-appointed Appeals Commissioner John Hansen during the four-Test series. 
    
	Apparently, Cricket Australia (CA) has a hand in the process being delayed. 
    
	Harbhajan has been slapped a three-Test ban by Match Referee Mike Procter, allegedly for calling Andrew Symonds a monkey in the Sydney Test. 
    
	As reported in these columns, Anil Kumble and Co. had (initially) been firm about not playing in the Perth Test, from Wednesday, if Harbhajans appeal wasnt disposed of by then. 
    
	Convincing the seniors wasnt easy, but a crisis has been avoided However, they remain incensed that Harbhajan has been branded a racist If the issue is prolonged, then they wont play the tri-series, the top source added. 
    
	While Test captain Kumble has retired from ODIs, the other seniors  Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni  are all available for selection. 
    
	Dhoni, in fact, has been the ODI (and Twenty20 captain) from last September. 
    
	In a related development, Pawar has directed the Boards joint-secretary, Mohinder Pandove, to head for Perth. 
    
	We need a senior Board official to be on the ground there, just in case the next few days again become critical, the top source pointed out. 
    
	While Team India reach Perth on Sunday afternoon, Pandove (as also selectors Venkatapathi Raju and Ranjib Biswal) should get there on Monday. 
    
	Meanwhile, Pawar and CA chairman Creagh Connor will meet in Dubai on Monday, on the sidelines of an ICC conclave. 
    
	Its to be seen if something comes of that, especially as many feel that nothing stops CA from getting Ricky Ponting to withdraw his complaint  even at this stage.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     SBT rally to hold Mumbai FC 3-3
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: SBT came back from two goals down to hold Mumbai FC 3-3 in a group A match of the 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Sunday. Both the teams are out of the tournament.         
	Mumbai went into the lead in the seventh minute of the match when K. Kulothungan netted a Subhasish Chakraborty cross from the right. SBT restored parity in the 29th minute via a Martin John shot but conceded two goals soon after Aseem K. and Felix Aboagye scored one each.         
	While Aseems long ranger went into the net hitting Paul Anthony, Felix converted a deflected chance for the third one in the 70th minute of the encounter. But it was the never-say-die attitude of the Bangalore side that saw them back with a bang in the closing minutes of the match when substitute Kannar R. nodded home a John Martin cross from the left for the second goal.         
	Luck favoured SBT late in the stoppage time. Referee gifted them a penalty when Sanjay Parte brought down Aneesh M. inside the box with a nasty tackle. Abdul Basheer, with a clinical right footer, sent it in the far corner and snatched two crucial points from their Mumbai opponents.         
	Meanwhile, in the 17th minute, SBT custodian Harshal Rahman P.V. fell unconscious on the ground after he was badly hit by a goal-bound shot. Rahman, who was taken to the hospital, was later released after doctors declared him fit. Jean Christian P.A. replaced him.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Jacob Oram                           
	Calcutta: New Zealands Jacob Oram has moved to the top of the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for ODI allrounders after a series-winning performance in Bangladesh.         
	According to an ICC release, Oram has overtaken Andrew Flintoff and Shoaib Malik to register the highest rating of his career to date. Indias Mahendra Singh Dhoni maintained his number one position in the batting rankings.         
	The 30-year-old scored 135 runs in the three matches against Bangladesh at an average of 67.50 and took four wickets at an equally impressive average of 12.50 and a miserly economy-rate of just 2.38.         
	Oram has also managed to gain no fewer than eight places in the rankings for ODI bowlers and is back in the top 10. Daniel Vettori has slipped from the top spot, to be replaced by Australian Nathan Bracken.         
	The Bangladesh series was a good one for Orams teammate, Kyle Mills who has moved into the top five in the bowlers rankings for the first time after taking five wickets at 10.83 in the series.         
	Sachin Tendulkar features at the eighth spot in the batting rankings.         
	Bangladesh who enjoyed several positive moments during the series against New Zealand including a win in the first match in Dhaka saw Saqibul Hasan move up 14 places to 25th in the bowlers rankings, taking over as his countrys highest-ranked ODI bowler.         
	Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful rose 12 places to 47th position in the batting rankings but things were not so positive for teammate Tamim Iqbal, who dropped five places to 40th after a relatively poor series for the 19-year-old from Chittagong.

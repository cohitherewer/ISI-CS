    - Weight of expectation doesnt seem to bother Torres           Alan Smith               (From left) Alvaro Arbeloa, Raul Albiol and Fernando Torres of Spain on arrival in Neustift on Thursday. (Reuters)                                 
	With Raul finally out of the picture after all these years, having been controversially omitted from the Spain squad, Fernando Torres cant have any doubts that the hopes of a nation rest more heavily on his shoulders than ever before.         
	For if Luis Aragoness side are to fulfil their great promise by finally giving Spain something to shout about, a striker will need to produce. And no one is better qualified, or indeed in better form, than this quietly confident 24-year-old who has had a prolific debut season for Liverpool.         
	Mind you, the weight of expectation doesnt seem to overly bother him. Atletico Madrids youngest captain yet at the age of 19 and now bearing the goalscoring brunt at Anfield, this baby-faced striker with a mentally tough streak seems to accept responsibility as comfortably as he accepts a spinning through-ball.         
	And when you look at the names backing him up in Austria and Switzerland, there shouldnt be a dearth of quality passes coming his way. Arsenals Cesc Fabregas and the Barcelona pair of Xavi and Andres Iniesta can all slickly load the gun, as can clubmate Xabi Alonso.         
	He might even get some help up front from the hard-working David Villa if Aragones departs from the 4-3-3 shape that achieved qualification. Yet those matches, plus his escapades for Liverpool, prove that Torres is more than capable of leading the line on his own, armed with a blistering turn of pace, sinewy strength and ruthless finishing ability.         
	It doesnt take a genius to work out, then, that if he comes out of the traps suitably prepared, if his movement and instincts prove as sharp as normal, he should cause an awful lot of problems to opponents. He should also enjoy better service than most of the forwards vying to finish as the tournaments top scorer.         
	You can actually get 11/1 on Spains No. 9 coming out on top, which isnt a bad bet considering Greece, Russia and Sweden make up Group D. A couple of goals early on and El Nino will quickly turn into the man everyone must stop.

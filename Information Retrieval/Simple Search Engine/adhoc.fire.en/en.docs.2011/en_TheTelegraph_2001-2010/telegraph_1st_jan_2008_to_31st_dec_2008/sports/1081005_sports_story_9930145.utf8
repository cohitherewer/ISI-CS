The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cameron White to replace McGain
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cameron White to replace McGain
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia (CA) on Saturday decided to rush in Victorian allrounder Cameron White as a replacement for the injured spinner Bryce McGain for the forthcoming Test series against India.         
	Cricket Australias national selection panel chairman Andrew Hilditch, currently with the team in Hyderabad for the four-day tour match against Board Presidents XI, said White would provide a good balance to the side in the Test series against India.         
	Bryce McGains long-term unavailability due to a shoulder injury gives his fellow Victorian right-arm leg-spinner Cameron White an opportunity to join the Australian Test squad in India, Hilditch said.         
	We feel that Camerons right-arm leg spin and experience in Indian conditions, where he has just returned after captaining the Australia A one-day team to a tournament victory, is the correct option and will provide a good balance to our slow bowling attack.         
	Camerons bowling has continued to improve over the past year at interstate level and his powerful batting adds extra depth and versatility to the squad, he added.         
	Interestingly, the team think-tank had initially enough faith in rookie off-spinner Jason Krejza and decided not to rush in a substitute immediately after McGain was ruled out.         
	Krejza, however, failed to convince, going wicketless and taking quite a battering in the first innings of the ongoing warm-up match, which prompted the selectors to draft in White.         
	Krejzas 20 overs went for 123 runs and the off-spinner did not meet success in the first innings. Though coach Tim Nielsen sought to defend him, Indian leg-spinner Piyush Chawla hinted the youngster would have a tough time in the Test series against India.         
	Hilditch meanwhile said Whites call-up was the just reward for his consistence performance throughout the year.         
	Cameron has performed well in Australian colours since his return to the one-day International squad earlier this year and he has now been rewarded with inclusion in the Test squad, he said.         
	White will join the Australian squad in Bangalore on Monday ahead of the first Test, starting on Thursday.

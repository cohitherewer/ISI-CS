The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We were better in all aspects: Coach
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We were better in all aspects: Coach
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Russias Dutch coach Guus Hiddink has said his side were better than Holland in all components of the game after dumping his countrymen out of Euro 2008.         
	Im extremely proud of the achievement of my team. I have not experienced this much in my career, he said.         
	Not only the team were superior technically with control in passing but also in physical parts to the Dutch team, which is tremendous because I know how they prepare tactically and physically.         
	I dont mean it (superior) as an arrogant word but we were better than the opponents in all components of the game.         
	Hiddink admitted he regretted accepting being labelled a traitor in Saturdays build-up. In my concept, the word traitor is a very bad word, he said.Of course, in my position I would have loved to outclass the Dutch team and if we win  an unexpected win, then Im very happy. But the word traitor was not used by me. I dont like the word.         
	He said: The short preparation time we got, meant we could hardly work tactically but we did it yesterday (Saturday). To do what they did... Thats a tremendous, unbelievable achievement by the team.

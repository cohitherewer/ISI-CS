                                                                                                                                                                                           Alex amazing, says Avram
                                    
	London: Chelsea coach Avram Grant paid a glowing tribute to Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson on Sunday. I want to congratulate Manchester United and Alex Ferguson, he said. He is a great manager and a great person... It is amazing what he did.         
	Chelsea and United can now look forward to clashing in the all-English Champions League final in Moscow on May 21, a match Grant said was a dream. When you come to the final you want to win. We wanted to win the league as well but it wasnt ever in our hands, he said.         
	The dour Israeli continued: It was not easy this season, there were many, many good things... We had a very difficult time sometimes.         
	We didnt start very good and then we played good football and then our big players got injured. We recovered very well with very good football so we can be proud. (AFP)

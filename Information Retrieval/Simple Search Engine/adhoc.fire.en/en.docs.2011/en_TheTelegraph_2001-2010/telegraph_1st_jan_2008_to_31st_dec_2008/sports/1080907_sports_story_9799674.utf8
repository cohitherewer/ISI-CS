	Calcutta: The Deccan Chargers, one of the eight teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), have decided to launch an inquiry into the war of words between skipper V.V.S. Laxman and Pakistani allrounder Shahid Afridi.         
	Tim Wright, chief executive of Deccan Chargers said in a statement that necessary action will be taken after the inquiry.         
	 In the interest of fairness and of thoroughness both players have been advised of this process and have been invited to contribute to the inquiry.         
	It may be recalled that a war of words had erupted between Laxman and Afridi after the latter had commented to a Pakistani channel that Adam Gilchrist would be a better choice to lead the Deccan Chargers and that Twenty20 did not suit Laxmans style of play.         
	Laxman, in response, had said that Afridi should remember that it was a collective failure that led to the team finishing last in the IPL and he had no business to blame the captain alone.         
	Afridi has no team ethics.Speaking negatively about the team in public, let alone the captain, is just not on. Being an experienced cricketer, he should not be questioning the way the team functions. I am really shocked to say the least, Laxman had reportedly commented.

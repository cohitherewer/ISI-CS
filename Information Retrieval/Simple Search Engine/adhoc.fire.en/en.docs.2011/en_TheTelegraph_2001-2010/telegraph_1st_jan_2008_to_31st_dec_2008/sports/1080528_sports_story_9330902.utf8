The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mauresmo in Round II
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mauresmo in Round II
  - Only 13 matches completed as rain allows less than three hours of play             Svetlana Kuznetsova in action against Japans Aiko Nakamura at Roland Garros on Tuesday. The Russian won 6-2, 6-3. (Reuters)                           
	Paris: Amelie Mauresmo held her nerve and her serve when it counted on Tuesday, reaching the second round of the French Open by beating Olga Savchuk 7-5, 4-6, 6-1 in a match interrupted by rain.         
	Mauresmo, who missed both the Italian and German Opens because of a rib injury, looked shaky through much of the match on centre court.         
	The start of play on Tuesday was delayed for two hours and 50 minutes because of rain, but Russian players Svetlana Kuznetsova and Dinara Safina reached the second round before another rain delay of nearly three hours.         
	When play resumed, No. 14 Agnieszka Radwanska beat Mariya Koryttseva 6-4, 6-3.         
	Among the men, fourth-seeded Nikolay Davydenko beat 2002 Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 and No. 9 Stanislas Wawrinka defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. No. 13 Juan Monaco lost to Robin Soderling of Sweden 2-6, 3-6, 1-6.         
	Each of the first three days of the French Open has been affected by rain, but Tuesday was the worst yet, with less than three hours of play the entire day. Only 13 matches were completed, five from the mens tournament and eight from the womens.         
	Three-time defending champion Rafael Nadal, who was originally scheduled to play his first match Monday, managed to play only two games against Thomaz Bellucci before rain suspended play for the day with the score 1-1.         
	Mauresmo was broken in her first two service games, and then again while serving for the first set at 5-4.         
	Leading 6-5 and again serving for the set, the Frenchwoman double-faulted for the fourth of her nine times to give her Ukrainian opponent a break point, but Mauresmo saved it with a backhand winner. She won the set when Savchuk sent a forehand into the net.         
	In the second set, Savchuk jumped out to a 2-0 lead, but Mauresmo got back to 2-2 before the rain came. When they came back on court, each player held serve until Savchuk broke Mauresmo while leading 5-4. Mauresmo dominated the third set, winning four straight games at the start.         
	The fourth-seeded Kuznetsova defeated Aiko Nakamura of Japan 6-2, 6-3 before the rain-interrupted play.         
	Despite conditions around the grounds, Kuznetsova didnt appear to have any problems against the 71st-ranked Nakamura.         
	Nakamura has never reached the second round in four appearances at the French Open.         
	Safina, seeded 13th, defeated Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine 6-1, 6-3. Safina, who was the last person to beat Justine Henin before the top-ranked Belgian retired this month, said she still had pain in her back.

	Ponte Vedra: Sergio Garcia won the biggest title of his career, and his first on the PGA Tour in three years, with a play-off victory over American Paul Goydos at the Players Championship on Sunday.         
	The Spaniard, who began the final round three strokes off the pace, triumphed at the first extra hole after hitting a superb tee shot to four feet at the treacherous par-three 17th.         
	Although the 28-year-old missed the birdie putt, his par was good enough to sink Goydos who double-bogeyed after his tee shot found water short of the island green.         
	The pair had finished the 72 regulation holes at five-under-par 283, journeyman Goydos missing a nine-footer to bogey the last for a 74 and Garcia closing with a 71.         
	This is huge for me and Im sure it will be huge for everybody back at home, Garcia told reporters after earning the winners cheque for $1.71 million and becoming the first European champion since Britains Sandy Lyle in 1987.         
	And I want to thank Tiger (Woods) for not being here, he added with a broad grin. That always makes things a little bit easier.         
	World No.1 Woods missed the event unofficially dubbed the fifth major as he recovers from knee surgery.         
	Daniel Chopra needed a strong final round for a top 10 finish but the Swede of Indian origin ended up signing off with six-over 78, his worst card of the week, to finish a disappointing tied 42nd.         
	Overnight tied 20th, hardly anything went right for Chopra who had just two birdies, both on his front nine, to show on the final day. Before he was halfway through his round, three front nine bogeys had already sent him over-par and worse awaited on his way back.         
	Bogeys simply flew from his club and he dropped five more shots in this stretch to finish with a 72-hole total of seven-over 295.           (AGENCIES)

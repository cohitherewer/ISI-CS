	Singapore: Force India drivers  Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella  say the idea to race under floodlights is exciting and to prepare well for the Singapore Grand Prix, they would remain at the track when the lights will be switched on for the first time.         
	World championship pace-setter Lewis Hamilton is also confident he will overcome any problems thrown up by racing at night around a street circuit at the Singapore Grand Prix this week.         
	The McLaren driver, who attended an FIA appeal tribunal on Monday to try and overturn a controversial 25-second penalty he picked up winning the Belgian Grand Prix, is excited at racing under the stars.         
	Im looking forward to visiting the country, trying the food, seeing what the track is like, seeing what it will be like to race on, said the Briton.         
	Gearing up for the first night race of the Formula One Championship, Sutil said it will be an interesting experience.         
	For sure having a race in the dark will be very interesting, the lights are going to be very bright, so for us it might seem like we are racing during the day, perhaps even brighter, Sutil said.         
	His Italian teammate Giancarlo Fisichella also has his task cut out and hopes to adapt to the circumstances soon. (PTI)

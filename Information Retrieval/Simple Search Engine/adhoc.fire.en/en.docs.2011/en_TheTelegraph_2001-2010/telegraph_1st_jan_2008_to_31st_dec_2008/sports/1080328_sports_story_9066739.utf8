The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Id rather quit than be mediocre, says Tiger
                                                   Id rather quit than be mediocre, says Tiger
                      
	Orlando: Tiger Woods said on Wednesday that he would rather quit golf than become mediocre and that he would know when to call it a day.         
	The world No. 1 has enjoyed an outstanding run of recent form, winning seven tournaments in succession world-wide before finishing two shots behind Geoff Ogilvy at the WGC-CA Championship in Miami.         
	Although retirement is not on the horizon, Woods said in an interview that he had worked out his exit plan.         
	For me it is very simple, it is when my best isnt good enough any more, said the 32-year-old. I could not live with myself going out and practising and preparing as hard as I do and knowing that if I go out and play my best someone is just going to beat me.         
	But that happens, your skills diminish, guys get better, they are more athletic. You have your time in the sun, there is nothing wrong in walking away from it.         
	I have accomplished so much in the sport already and hopefully I can continue to do that for as long as I possibly can but when that time comes, well, every athlete knows when that happens, added the 13-times major winner.         
	Woods said he would find it tough to carry on competing when he was not at his best. I am trying to prolong it, that early exit, he said. One of the great things about our sport is you can play as long as you want. But do you want to play in mediocrity? That is the thing that I would have a hard time with.         
	Woods said he was a long way yet from reaching that stage. I am 32 and I feel like I am just entering my prime, said the American. Every sport is slightly different.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Important for Bengal players to get back to Elite: Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Important for Bengal players to get back to Elite: Sourav
            A CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: It has been a little under 18 years since he first turned out for Bengal but a relaxed Sourav Ganguly said he felt good to be playing cricket again and almost at once revealed how the pressure was off his shoulders in his final first-class game.         
	Talking to reporters on the eve of Bengals game against Goa in the Ranji Trophy Plate Division semi-finals, he hoped to make a contribution to ensuring that Bengal would qualify for the Elite Division next year. CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya, too, is here and is expected to be present at the ground.         
	It must have been a few years since Sourav addressed a media conference like the one he did on the eve of his final Ranji Trophy game at the Karnail Singh Stadium here on Wednesday.         
	With no formal conference room at the stadium here, he sat in a chair, a clutch of TV cameras and reporters crowding around him.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On why he is playing the Ranji game         
	I was requested by the players and the Cricket Association of Bengal to play this game. It is an important match. Bengal were relegated to this seasons Plate Division and hopefully I can contribute to the team making it to the Elite division next season. It is important for the boys and their careers that Bengal get back to the Elite division. For, performance in Elite group is noticed.         
	His memories of playing in Ranji Trophy         
	The first game I played was a Ranji Trophy final against Delhi (at Eden Gardens in March 1990). We won that. But with a lot of memories from 13 years of international cricket, you realise that you dont get to play much in Ranji Trophy. I have played on and off for Bengal when I needed practice or some crucial games. It is the most important tournament in India for you look at players on the basis of their performance here.         
	If he has butterflies in the stomach         
	Obviously, you want to do well wherever you play but you cant compare it with what goes on before an international game. My international career is over and there is no pressure on me anymore. There should be a pressure to perform, you cannot go into a game relaxed and expect to perform. Other than that there is no pressure.         
	His emotions on being at a cricket ground after retiring from Test cricket         
	It has been a month and not much time to notice any difference. It is an important game for Bengal. It is good to be playing cricket again but there is a huge difference between international and first-class cricket.         
	If there is a void in his life         
	India have played just one Test match and I have not missed it. I saw the team play a fantastic Test match but no, I didnt miss it.         
	On the youngsters in the Bengal team         
	I train and practice with these boys in the off-season. I have seen most of them, some being a part of the team in IPL as well. I know them personally.         
	Indias bid to claim the top ranking from Australia         
	Of course, we have the ability to be No. 1 in the world. There is a gap between Australia and other teams on the ICC rankings. India have done well at home against South Africa, Australia and England this year but they will have to do well overseas, they will face the real test and only then we will know how close we are to bridging the gap.         
	If he is happy that Yuvraj Singh came good in the Chennai Test         
	Replacements have to come in any form of cricket. Men like Gavaskar, Vengsarkar and Mohinder Amarnath faded but Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman and Ganguly came on the scene and after these, there will be other players. It is a great scenario for India that replacements come along. Yuvraj Singh has performed well in one-day cricket and has the ability to do it in Tests as well. Hopefully he will turn his ability into performances.         
	What role he envisages for himself within cricket?         
	I have not thought about my role in cricket. I have been doing my own work, setting up my business and spent a lot of time there. I have taken a break from the game. It will take its course slowly. I have had a rigorous life for 13-14 years and will take it as it comes.

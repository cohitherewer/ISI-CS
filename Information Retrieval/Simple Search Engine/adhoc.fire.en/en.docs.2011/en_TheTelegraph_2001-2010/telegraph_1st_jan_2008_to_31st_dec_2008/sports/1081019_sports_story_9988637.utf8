The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Superb Sourav shows his class once again 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Superb Sourav shows his class once again 
    - Bowlers push Aussies on the backfoot captains knock by Dhoni             SUDIPTO GANGULY                            
	Mohali: Sourav Ganguly and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni combined to take India to a position of strength before the bowlers paid tribute to the batsmens efforts, picking up four crucial Australian wickets here on Saturday.         
	Sourav and Dhoni had a 109-run seventh wicket partnership on Saturday, and in the process, the southpaw brought up his 16th Test century to take India to a solid first-innings score of 469.         
	Debutant leg-spinner Amit Mishra then picked up a couple of wickets, with pacers Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma scalping one each to reduce Australia to 102/4 at the end of second days play.         
	Matthew Haydens dismal tour continued as Zaheer bowled him off the third ball of the Australian innings. He failed to open his account and had no clue to the left-arm pacers incoming delivery. The ball hit him on the pad before disturbing the stumps.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting lost another duel with Indias young fast-bowling sensation Ishant. Ponting fell lbw to an in-swinger after surviving a close shout for another leg before decision in the same over. The intense competition has been on between the two from Indias last tour of Australia.         
	Ishant had made quite a name for himself Down Under after troubling Ponting on a number of occasions throughout the series. Incidentally, both Ponting and Ishant play for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League.         
	Mishra picked up Simon Katich with one that spun into him. Katich looked the most solid among the Australian batsmen before being bowled by the leg-spinner. Michael Clarke was Mishras second victim of the day and was out lbw to a straight one. Clarke stitched together a 40-run partnership with Mike Hussey, before getting out in the last over of the day.         
	Hussey, unbeaten on 37, has already survived an edge that went between wicketkeeper Dhoni and Rahul Dravid at first slip. Dhoni failed to react in time as the chance went abegging.         
	Earlier, Sourav reached his century with a superb flick off Cameron White. A pumped-up celebration followed. He, however, didnt last long after that, failing to resist the temptation of dancing down the track to White. He holed out to mid-off, where Brett Lee made no mistake in taking the catch.         
	Sourav seemed to carry on from where he had left off in Bangalore, when he made a crucial unbeaten 26 in the second innings to save the Test for India. He had got out for 47 in the first innings. This time he made sure he reached the coveted three-figure mark.         
	His innings on Saturday was more of a gritty kind. He was happy to play second fiddle to Dhoni in their partnership and looked to accumulate his runs rather than being aggressive.         
	Not for once, before completing his century, did he try to hit White over mid-off or mid-on  his famous shot against the spinners.         
	After announcing his retirement before the start of the first Test, the 36-year old left-handed batsman seems to have found a new level of confidence and determination. He, for sure, wants to end his career on a high.         
	Dhoni, leading the side in place of the injured Anil Kumble, walked out with a lot of positive intent. His innings of 92 came in quick time (124 balls) by Test standards, and was studded with eight boundaries and four sixes.         
	He was the last man to fall for India and was out lbw off Peter Siddle. However, he might consider himself unlucky as the ball appeared to hit him outside the line of off-stump.         
	Dhoni pulled the first delivery he faced from Brett Lee to the square leg fence for a boundary, and in the next over, hooked Siddle for a six. The Indian ODI and T20 captain took a lot of pressure off Souravs shoulders and maintained a brisk scoring rate.         
	Nightwatchman Ishant didnt frustrate the visitors for long. The credit for his dismissal should go to Ponting. Ishant looked quite comfortable against the outside the off-stump line from Lee and Siddle.         
	Ponting is too good a captain not to realise that. He employed a short leg fielder and asked Siddle to come round the stumps and bowl some short-pitched deliveries into Ishants body.         
	The strategy immediately bore fruit. Siddles delivery climbed into Ishants rib cage and the lanky fast-bowler had nothing to do but defend it awkwardly. The ball hit the top half of his bat and lobbed up to Katich at short leg.         
	Harbhajan Singh didnt stay for long. He failed to pick a googly from White. The ball breached his defence and disturbed the timber.         
	Zaheer Khan, who scored a half-century in the last Test in Bangalore, was run out in a disappointing fashion.         
	Dhoni scampered for a quick single to keep strike for the next over, but Zaheer was late to react and couldnt make it in time.         
	Hussey will be the best bet for the visitors. The Indian bowlers are getting increasingly confident and the first session on Sunday might eventually decide the fate of the match.         
	Cameron White, the Aussie spinner who enjoyed some success on Friday, was also of the same opinion. The first session tomorrow will dictate the course of the Test match Its a big first session for us tomorrow, he told the media at the end of the days play.         
	They (the Indians) have done well with the new ball and would be handy with reverse swing as well. I think it would be pretty tough tomorrow, White added.         
	The leg-spinner also denied that his team was defensive. Thats not the case. It was not easy out there. In fact it was all hardwork in the middle, he insisted.

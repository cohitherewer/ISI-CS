The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes support for torch relay
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Paes support for torch relay
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indias Davis Cup captain Leander Paes on Wednesday came out in support of the Olympic torch relay and said he was against mixing politics and sports.         
	Some people are in favour of boycotting the torch relay but I am not among them. This is an issue completely different from Chinas policy on Tibet and the two shouldnt be mixed, the Olympic bronze medallist said. The Olympic torch relay stands for peace and harmony, he added.         
	Paes said the Olympic movement was very close to his heart. I will be participating in my fifth Olympics when I pair up with Mahesh (Bhupathi) in the doubles. I have already won a medal in singles and now I will try to get a medal in doubles, too. To me, Olympics is something very special.         
	When pointed out that many human rights groups wanted the torch relay to be boycotted, Paes said: We have to recognise that there is a difference between the Olympic movement and the Tibetan movement. It is not correct to mix them, he said.         
	The Olympic movement should not be hampered. When my father (Dr. Vece Paes) played in the Olympics and won a medal in hockey in 1972, the Games were disrupted by that infamous Black September problem. But the Games didnt stop then. It continued, he added.         
	Paes said he had been invited to take part in the torch relay but was yet to make up his mind. Yes, I have been invited. You will find out if I decide to take part in it, he said.

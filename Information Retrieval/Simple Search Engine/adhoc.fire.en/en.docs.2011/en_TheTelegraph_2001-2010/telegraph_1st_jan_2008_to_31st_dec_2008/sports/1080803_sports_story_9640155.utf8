                                                                                                                                                                                                     Another record by Sushmita
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The second day of the 58th State Athletic Championship failed to produce any surprise or thrill. Under a sweltering August sun, there was lack of excitement at the Salt Lake Stadium. There were no fireworks except Sushmita Singha Royss meet record in the women s 100 metres.         
	Anil Soren, in the under-18 mens 110-metre hurdles, equalled his meet record, set last year, with a timing of 14.60 seconds. Training under Kartik Nath of the Sports Authority of India (SAI), the South 24 Parganas boy is one of the most promising athletes of the state.         
	Rahamatulla Molla of Police Athletic Club equalled the meet record of 21.6 seconds in the mens 200 metres, despite pulling his calf muscle right at the start of the race.         
	In shot put, too, nothing extraordinary was on show. Sarmila Dey of Hoogly DSA threw the put 12.45 metres to equal the meet record in girls under-20 category.         
	The ennui was lifted by the appearance of Olympic heptathlete Sushmita Singha Roy, who went through the paces, fine tuning her javelin throwing.         
	The most interesting development took place off the field. Former athlete Mukti Saha, who holds the records in the under-20 girls 200 and 400 metres, announced a reward of Rs. 2000 each for the athlete/athletes who break her record.         
	Among women, Pinki Dey of SAIL Athletic Academy came very close to overhauling the meet record of 11.96 metres in womens under-18 shot put with a throw of 11.71 metres.

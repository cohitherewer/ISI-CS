	Sydney: Andrew Symonds, aided by some umpiring errors, posted his second Test hundred to lead Australia out of a deep rut Wednesday after India seamer R.P. Singh ripped through the top-order.         
	R.P. Singh took four wickets, including two in a 29-minute period when he and Harbhajan Singh combined to snare four wickets for 15 runs.         
	Australia slumped to 134 for six after opting to bat in the second Test, but allrounder Symonds resurrected the innings with partnerships of 173 with Brad Hogg and 69 with Brett Lee. At close on Day I, the hosts scored a dominant 376 for seven. Symonds remained unbeaten on 13, while giving him company was Brett Lee on 31. Hogg scored 79.         
	When on 107, Symonds clearly nicked Ishant Sharma to wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni but was given not out. Symonds was again lucky when he was declared not out by the Australian third umpire Bruce Oxenford after being stumped by Dhoni off Anil Kumble.         
	Captain Ricky Ponting (55) was also a beneficiary of a poor umpiring decision when he was on 17. He clearly nicked Sourav Ganguly to Dhoni but umpire Mark Benson did not rule him out.         
	However, Benson came to Indias aid in the afternoon when he did not spot Pontings huge inside edge on to his pads and ruled in favour of Harbhajan with the team total of 119 for three.         
	It triggered a mini-collapse for the hosts as Mike Hussey (41) departed two balls later. Michael Clarke (one) and Adam Gilchrist (seven) didnt trouble the visitors either.         
	The Symonds-Hogg partnership was finally broken when the latter edged a cut off Kumble to Rahul Dravid in the slips. It was also the best seventh wicket stand ever seen at the SCG, bettering the 160-run partnership between Richie Benaud and Graham McKenzie against South Africa 41 seasons ago. India had more trouble in store as Lee joined Symonds for their unbroken eighth wicket stand.         
	Symonds batted for 246 minutes for his 173-ball unbeaten 137. He hit 17 fours and two sixes. Lee faced 67 deliveries en route to his unbeaten 31 (5x4).         
	R.P. Singh had given the visitors an excellent start by accounting for Phil Jaques (0) and Matthew Hayden (13) in his first five overs.         
	Jaques, playing in front of his home crowd, tried an upper-cut off a rising delivery only to give a catch to Dhoni.         
	Hayden (13) was surprised by a delivery that bounced and left him as he edged it for Sachin Tendulkar to take a beautiful catch diving to his right at first slip.

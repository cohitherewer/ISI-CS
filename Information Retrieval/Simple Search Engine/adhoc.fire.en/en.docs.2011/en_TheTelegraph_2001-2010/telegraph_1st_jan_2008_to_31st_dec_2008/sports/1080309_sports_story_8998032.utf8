	Hamilton: A sensational hattrick by Ryan Sidebottom shattered New Zealands run charge and ignited an England fightback on Day IV of the first Test here Saturday.         
	New Zealand, who had been in control and rapidly building a challenging target, lost five wickets in 29 balls to be struggling at 147 for eight in their second innings.         
	Daniel Vettori, unbeaten on 13, and Jeetan Patel on six were grimly trying to extend the lead of 269 while Sidebottom was basking in figures of five for 37 off 14 overs and Monty Panesar had three for 33 off 12.         
	Sidebottoms wickets of Stephen Fleming, Mathew Sinclair and Jacob Oram  the first hattrick against New Zealand in more than 70 years  was central to the dramatic switch of momentum.         
	New Zealand had started their second innings with a 122-run lead after dismissing England for 348.         
	Following the early loss of Matthew Bell, Fleming and Jamie How struck more than 3.6 an over as New Zealand upped the tempo, seeking a result despite Englands unhurried batting.         
	They raced to 99 for one in the 28th over when Sidebottom snatched the initiative, albeit assisted by some magnificent catching.         
	He started with the wicket of How for 39, claimed in a high and diving fashion by Matthew Hoggard.         
	On the last ball of his next over Sidebottom started his hattrick run when he had Fleming flay once too often and he was gone for 66, caught by Alastair Cook diving to his left in the gully.         
	With the first two balls of his next over Sidebottom had Sinclair caught by Cook diving high to his left for two and Oram was trapped in front for a duck.         
	It was only the second hattrick against New Zealand in their 338-Test history with the first by Englands Maurice Allom in 1930 during New Zealands first ever Test.         
	Between Sidebottoms two overs, New Zealand had sent big-hitting Brendon McCullum to the wicket to keep the scoring rate up but his first attempt to sweep Panesar resulted in a top edge to Andrew Strauss.         
	Panesar followed up with the dismissal of first-innings centurion Ross Taylor, who drove the ball straight back to the bowler and was gone for six, and just before stumps he claimed Kyle Mills leg before wicket for 11.         
	Through the first three-and-a-half days England had shown little inclination to dominate, batting at a pedestrian rate in reply to New Zealands first innings 470.         
	On the fourth morning they put on a meagre 61 runs in the first session, losing Paul Collingwood on the way when he was trapped in front by Oram for 66. It was just reward for the New Zealand allrounder who, in his previous over, had Tim Ambrose dropped by the wicketkeeper.

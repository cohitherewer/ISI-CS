The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proud of way we played: Kumble
                                                  Proud of way we played: Kumble
                  Virender Sehwag after reaching his century on Monday                     
	Anil Kumble on Monday said that India have the ability to challenge Australias supremacy in world cricket.         
	The following are excerpts from his news conference in Adelaide:         
	On his assessment of the final Test         
	Coming into this Test we had an opportunity. I thought the wicket played really true on all the five days. Then we lost RP early which meant we were reduced to four bowlers. So it was disappointing and a bit of a tough call I am really proud of the way we played.         
	On whether the presence of Virender Sehwag could have made a difference in the first two Tests         
	Hindsight is a good thing to have But coming into this Test series the team that played in Melbourne was the best that we could have picked for the MCG. The same applies to the team for the Sydney Test. I think Viru has done exceptionally well in the two Tests and so has Irfan Pathan.         
	On whether he was satisfied with the outcome         
	We had our moments. It was pretty close in Sydney If we had hung on for another 6/7 minutes we could have saved that Test. We are the only team to have won two Test matches against the Aussies in the last four years here. It goes to show what we are capable of.         
	On whether the relationship between the two teams soured after Sydney         
	We always had a good relationship. It was just one of those moments in Sydney and for whatever reasons It was just a hurdle and we have moved on from there. The last two Test matches have been played in the right spirit and Im happy about the way we played on the field and off it as well.         
	On how he enjoyed the series         
	If you look back we didnt come with our fast bowling attack wasnt at full strength because of injuries. Then we lost our main fast bowler Zaheer after the first Test Looking back the way the young fast bowling attack responded to the challenge was fantastic. Somebody like R.P. Singh led the attack and bowled beautifully Ishant was probably the find of the series His attitude and aggression were commendable         
	On whether he had self doubts before embarking on this tour         
	Im also humanI also have doubts At the same time Ive played enough cricket to understand that the quality of players and experience we have in the side is awesome Everybody put his hand up be it the senior member of the team or the youngest in Ishant. Personally Im very happy         
	On the gains         
	We probably play our best cricket against Australia and we play them not too far from now, in September this year. You have a few people who might not be a part of the Test squad in a couple of years but there is a lot of talent there, as this series has shown. Our young bowlers have done well and this experience will stand them in good stead.         
	On his game plan on the last day         
	It was important we got through the first session without losing too many wickets. Unfortunately Dravid got injured and there was a run out but Sehwag batted brilliantly in both the innings. It was a tough call since you need time and a lot of overs to get Australia out. That didnt happen Ideally if we had a lead of 60-70 runs yesterday then we could have pushed on.         
	On Adam Gilchrists decision         
	I didnt expect him to retire I was a bit surprised when I heard that on air   In wish him all the very best Im sure he has his reasons. A fanstastic player and a great role model for any player to look up to.

	Beijing: Argentinas Lionel Messi, cleared to play in the Olympics after striking a late deal with his club Barcelona, celebrated by scoring the opener and creating the winner as the South Americans beat Ivory Coast 2-1 on Thursday.         
	After a lively start from Ivory Coast, who played with plenty of pace and ambition, Argentina took the lead after Riquelme threaded a superb pass into the path of Messi who showed great composure as he effortlessly slotted home.         
	The Africans fought back though after the break when Sekou Cisse rose superbly at the back post and his firm header flashed past Oscar Ustari to make it 1-1.         
	Messi, lively throughout, set up Aguero for a shot on goal that was ruled out for offside in the 65th and then with four minutes of normal time remaining Messi fired in a low, diagonal drive which was parried out into the path of substitute Lautaro Acosta who slotted into the unguarded goal to ensure Argentina move to the top of Group A.         
	Hosts China needed a late equaliser to snatch a 1-1 draw with rank outsiders New Zealand in the Olympic soccer tournament on Thursday. Former gold medallists and fellow Africans Nigeria and Cameroon were also involved in stalemates against the Netherlands and South Korea respectively.         
	Nigeria drew 0-0 with the Netherlands in Group B and Cameroon were held 1-1 by South Korea in Group D.         
	Despite having Steven Old sent off for a second bookable offence in the 39th minute, New Zealand stunned a packed crowd at the Shenyang Olympic stadium when Jeremy Brockie scored eight minutes after the restart of their Group C game.         
	China, keen to avoid more embarrassment after recently being knocked out of the World Cup qualifiers, salvaged a point when substitute Dong Fangzhuo headed in at the near post.         
	Georges Mandjeck scored in the 81st minute to give Cameroon, winners in Sydney in 2000, a point after Park Chu Youngs goal had put South Korea ahead in the 68th minute in Group D.         
	Earlier, Italy and the United States made winning starts to their campaigns while Australia and Serbia drew 1-1.         
	A superb left-foot volley from the edge of the area by Sebastian Giovinco gave Italy the lead in the 41st minute of their Group D match against Honduras. Just four minutes later they doubled their advantage through a Giuseppe Rossi penalty.         
	TheAzzurrini put the game well beyond the reach of the Hondurans when Robert Acquafresca was brought down by keeper Kevin Hernandez and rose to convert the penalty and make it 3-0.         
	In Group B, the United States were in charge for much of their game against Japan but it was only a strike from Stuart Holden, two minutes after the break, that secured them a winning start. However, they had to endure some late pressure.

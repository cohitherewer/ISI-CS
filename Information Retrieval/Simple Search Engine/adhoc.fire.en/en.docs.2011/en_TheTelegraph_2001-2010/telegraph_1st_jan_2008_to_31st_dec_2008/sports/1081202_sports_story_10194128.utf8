The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Innings win   for Aussies
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Innings win   for Aussies
                                  
	Lee, who took nine wickets for a career-best match return, was not at his best during the India tour, but he has improved with each innings since coming home.         
	The visitors started the fourth day 230 behind and were soon caught in a Lee whirlwind that resulted in a demoralising defeat in the final Test for the coach John Bracewell.         
	Brendon McCullum was the lone fighter for Australia with his 84. The New Zealand wicketkeeper hit 14 boundaries and two sixes during his knock.

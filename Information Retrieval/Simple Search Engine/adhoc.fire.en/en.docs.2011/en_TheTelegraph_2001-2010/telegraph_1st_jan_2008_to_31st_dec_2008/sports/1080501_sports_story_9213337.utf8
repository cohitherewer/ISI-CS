The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting Souravs biggest worry
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Batting Souravs biggest worry
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Jaipur: Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly on Wednesday said that he was not keen on Sohaib Akhtars replacement in the team for the time being.         
	We now have three good bowlers, who are delivering the goods, Sourav said on arrival here. I am more worried about our batting. We will only consider recruiting another bowler when we will feel the need...               
	The following are excerpts         
	Losing to Mumbai Indians         
	We lost because we batted badly. There was nothing wrong with the pitch. We should have scored more runs. Whats the point in blaming the wicket?         
	The plan ahead         
	In Twenty20 format, any team can win. Thats the fun of this shortest version of the game. It all depends on the days performance. Dont forget, we also won two games in the beginning. If we win a couple of more games, our team may again return to the top.         
	If returning to winning ways will be tough         
	Not really... We have played some good matches initially. We won two, lost two. We were never outplayed. Sometimes the boys are not getting enough rest. We played a match yesterday (Tuesday) night and then rushed here. We have still 10 games to go. On how he rates the opposition         
	Rajasthan Royals are definitely playing well. At the same time we are prepared and hope to bounce back. What do you expect me to say about Warne? He is a great bowler and dangerous in any form of the game.         
	If the tournament is less glamorous without the Aussies         
	Not exactly. The Aussies are tremendous players. But teams are getting good replacements for them, too. Looking at the way people all over the country are going to the venues, I assume the tournament is a great hit Chris Gayle being ruled out was a big loss. But we have got (Brad) Hodge. More importantly, youngsters like Laxmi (Ratan Shukla), Wriddhiman Saha, Debabrata Das, Ashok Dinda are doing very well.

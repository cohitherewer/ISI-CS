The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zico pinning hopes on Alex
                                                   Zico pinning hopes on Alex
                                  Fenerbahce coach Zico		    
	Istanbul: Coach Zico says it is imperative Fenerbahce beat Chelsea in Wednesdays Champions League quarter final first leg.         
	Fenerbahce are facing one of the most important matches in their history, said the former Brazil captain.         
	We definitely have to win the first match at home. If we concentrate properly we can achieve our goal.         
	Zico will be pinning his hopes on playmaker Alex in his teams debut appearance in the last eight.         
	Alex scored twice in Saturdays 2-1 victory over city rivals Besiktas, a result that gave Fenerbahce renewed confidence in their battle to win the Turkish title. I dont want anyone to talk about the Besiktas game any more, said Zico. Another very big test awaits us on Wednesday.         
	Since joining the club four years ago, Alex has scored 70 goals in 116 league matches.         
	He could be joined in Wednesdays team by fellow-Brazilian Roberto Carlos, who has been out injured since the first leg of their last-16 tie with Sevilla.         
	Midfielder Ugur Boral, injured against Besiktas, is likely to be fit while Onder Turaci will probably play at right back in place of the suspended Gokhan Gonul.         
	Chelsea manager Avram Grant finds himself in a peculiar position despite collecting five wins and a draw from his last six Premier League games.         
	A fortunate 1-0 victory over Middlesbrough on Sunday means the Londoners are still the closest challengers to Manchester United in the title race but there are grumblings of discontent among the fans.         
	The League Cup final defeat by Tottenham Hotspur and a humiliating defeat by Championship (second division) side Barnsley in the FA Cup have reduced Grants chances of winning a trophy in his first season.         
	Midfielder Frank Lampard should return after missing Sundays victory with a stomach upset.         
	Goalkeeper Petr Cech is doubtful with an ankle injury but Didier Drogba is expected to be fit after picking up a knock at the weekend.           (REUTERS)

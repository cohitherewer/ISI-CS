                                                    Srinath takes a 
 dig at Gloster

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

	New Delhi: Former India star Jawagal Srinath feels that Team India physio John Gloster should explain why Indian pace bowlers are getting injured so frequently. 
    
	All our pacers have been victims of injury in the past few months. I dont know what exactly has happened The physio (Gloster) should be able to answer that better. It is he who should set the standard, the former pace spearhead said. 
    
	Srinath, who was speaking on the sidelines of the Gatorade Pacers 2008 Talent Hunt  which commences on Friday  said he was not convinced about the theorythat the players were getting injured because of too much cricket. 
    
	Too much cricket is not the reason as far as Im concerned, Srinath said. All other teams are going through almost similar schedules. 
    
	Asked how come Zaheer Khan again picked up an injury on the eve of the Sydney Test, Srinath said it could be the result of bowling too many overs in the last few months. 
    
	Starting from County cricket, Zaheer has perhaps bowled 500 to 550 overs in the last six months. It has certainly taken a toll on his body. Now he has suffered an ankle injury. That is one of the worst forms of injury for a fast bowler. 
    
	Srinath was critical of players who hide their injuries and play only to break down in the middle of a match. 
    
	A player knows the best about himself, Srinath said. He should consider his future, his own physical condition and commitment. 
    
	It comes from within. If he hides an injury and continues to play, he would only make short-term gains. It is going to harm him in the long run. 
    
	R.P. Singh, according to Srinath, was the most impressive bowler on the first day of the Sydney Test. His line and length was great. Despite Zaheers absence, I am confident India are capable of bowling Australia out twice in the Test. 
    
	Srinath admitted that a few umpiring decisions may have gone against India, but dismissed it as part of the game. 
    
	Sometimes you get good decisions, sometimes it goes against you. Thats the way the game is played. There is no point ruing over it, the ICC Match Referee felt.

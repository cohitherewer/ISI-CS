                                                   Pollock, Smith put SA on top

           
	Durban: Graeme Smith stroked a fluent 13th Test century to keep South Africa on top in the third and final Test against the West Indies Thursday. South Africa were 213 for one, a lead of 74 runs after they had bowled out the tourists for 139, when bad light ended play 10 overs early on the first day. 
    
	Smith reached 122 not out in a chanceless innings, sharing an unbroken stand of 160 with Hashim Amla (55 not out) to record South Africas highest second-wicket partnership against the West Indies. 
    
	Recalled seamer Shaun Pollock, who was left out of South Africas first six Tests of the season, led the home sides attack with his return of four for 35. Fast bowler Dale Steyn made the initial breakthrough when he had Daren Ganga caught by Smith at first slip for three. 
    
	Pollock, who is playing his 108th Test, struck for the first time by trapping Runako Morton in front for just one. 
    
	Herschelle Gibbs took the first of three catches in the gully when he leapt high and to his right to remove debutant Brenton Parchment (11) off an edge from Pollocks bowling. 
    
	Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini struck in consecutive overs to have Marlon Samuels caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher for six and Shivnarine Chanderpaul snapped up by Kallis at second slip for a duck. 
    
	The series is level at 1-1.

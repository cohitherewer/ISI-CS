	Margao: There was good news for the East Bengal colts on Wednesday when the organisers of the India Finals of the Manchester United Premier Cup came up with a face-saving solution to overcome the over-age problem. 
    
	With the tournament being thrown into uncertainty after 43 boys from eight teams  including eight from East Bengal  were sent for MRIs, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) held an emergency meeting with the sponsors Nike and the local organisers to sort out the issue. 
    
	It was decided that all the 43 boys would be allowed to play in the tournament for the time being. 
    
	We wont get the MRI results before January 21, said an official. The tournament finishes on January 20. So we have decided to allow all those boys to take part. 
    
	According to the tournament rules, if two or more players of a team are found over-age, that team would be barred from taking part. 
    
	If the MRI results find two or more players of a team guilty, we will scratch the team and the results of their matches. In case the ultimate champions get scratched, the next seeded team would earn the ticket for the south Asia finals in Singapore, the official added. 
    
	East Bengal have been placed in group B with Sant Bawa Football Academy (Gurdaspur), Mahindra United and Sporting Clube de Goa. Group A comprises Salgaocar, Cosmos Club (Chennai), Sabra Sikshya Football Academy (Mizoram) and St Stephens Football Academy (Chandigarh). 
    
	East Bengal open their campaign against Mahindra United on Thursday. In an exhibition match between the two teams on Wednesday, the Calcutta side dominated proceedings but lost in the tie-breaker. 
    
	The tournament was inaugurated by AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi on Wednesday morning.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Samaraweera   century revives Lanka 
                            
	Port of Spain: A patient century from Thilan Samaraweera helped Sri Lanka recover to 268 all out at the close of play on the third day of the second test on Saturday, setting the West Indies a victory target of 253.         
	The tourists were reeling at 99 for six but a seventh-wicket stand of 138 between Samaraweera (125) and Chaminda Vaas (45) hauled Sri Lanka back into the game and the pressure will now be on West Indiess batsmen on a track showing plenty of life.         
	Samaraweera said that he and Vaas had initially looked at making a target of 150 to give Sri Lanka a fighting chance but now he rated his side favourites.         
	We talked about 150 at first, then 200 and 250. Anything can happen in a second innings with uneven bounce and we have a world-class spinner in Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	The new ball is the key, if we can get a couple of early wickets and then we have a special spinner, my thought is that we will definitely win, he added.           (REUTERS)

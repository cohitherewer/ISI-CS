The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harmison should be axed for good
                                                     Harmison should be axed for good
                    GUEST COLUMN    Geoffrey Boycott                    Steve Harmison      
	What a difference a week makes. Congratulations to the England selectors for having the courage to drop Steve Harmison and, to a lesser degree, Matthew Hoggard for the Wellington Test.         
	Fresh legs won this Test because Stuart Broad and James Anderson gave us the edge.         
	Anderson has always had the ability to bowl wicket-taking deliveries. He has a superb out-swinger and when he gets it right, he can bowl anybody out. Bowling a lot of overs for Auckland in their provincial game against Wellington was a huge bonus for him and for England.         
	Broad was a calculated gamble but he did superbly. I feel that he will be a better bowler in 18 months time. I felt playing Test cricket now may have been too soon for his development but he bowled with good pace and he was the one bowler who upset Brendon McCullum.         
	When McCullum advanced down the pitch in a threatening pose, Broad bowled short of a length into his body with pace. McCullum got in a right tangle and England need to store that away for the next Test.         
	McCullum has great bat-speed and good hand-eye coordination. The name of his game is to intimidate the bowlers. If Broad can make him feel uncomfortable and get him out cheaply in the final Test, it would be a big bonus for England.         
	Ryan Sidebottom has now become Englands banker bowler. Hes a class act with a big heart, has great skill and a passion for bowling for his country.         
	Englands new look bowling attack, together with Tim Ambroses match-winning innings, were the difference between the two sides in Wellington.         
	Ambrose counter-attacked by playing some great shots and took the match away from New Zealand. He rode his luck playing and missing but before anyone gets carried away that we have found a new wicketkeeper-batsman just remember that Matt Prior got a hundred in his first Test. This kid has got one in his second.         
	The jury is still out and we need to give him a number of Tests before we assess him. He missed a stumping but he reminds me of Bob Taylor. The ball disappears nicely into his gloves.         
	I believe that on paper, England are a better team than New Zealand. But if they are going to win the Test and the series in Napier, they can and must improve in certain areas.         
	The catching and ground fielding in Wellington were sloppy. One of the batsmen, when they get in, has to go on and make a century.         
	Too many of them are making elementary mistakes and getting out when they have got themselves in.         
	Monty Panesar has bowled too full, which is a good fault, but he needs more variation like Daniel Vettori. At the moment Montys bowling pace is metronomic. He needs to mix it up more. Spin is an art form. You need to out-think the batsman, keep him guessing so that hes not sure what is coming next. All of Montys deliveries are approximately the same speed.         
	Elsewhere, Andrew Strauss is having a torrid time. He has still got poor footwork and mentally he looks to be a tormented soul. Hes ultra-defensive with no confidence.         
	But he is working hard at trying to stay in. The longer he stays at the crease the more runs he will make. The more runs he scores, the more confidence he will get. Its a vicious circle.         
	But for my money I would pick the same guys for the final Test.         
	I believe in the old adage that you never change a winning team.         
	Where does this leave Harmison and Hoggard? The latter is the sort of bowler who needs lots of hard work and plenty of bowling in matches. If he gets that early season with Yorkshire he will be back in contention for a place.         
	But Harmison is different. Since the Ashes series of 2005 he has been poor, indifferent to bad. Hes not got enough wickets and been given so many chances. We all know about his potential. He has great height and, at his best, he has bounce and pace like Curtly Ambrose.         
	But people have got tired of waiting for results. There comes a point when the public and selectors get fed up and disillusioned with a guy not delivering. That time has come. Harmison has had too many opportunities and England need to move on to new guys.         
	If he gets a central contract this summer over some of the new kids, or any sort of central contract, then a lot of us will be screaming: favouritism and a total waste of money. England should forget him.         
	He needs to go back to Durham on reduced wages and be made to think about what he wants to do with his career. Does he really want to play cricket at all? Maybe he has become one of those players, like Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash, who can do it county level but cant do it for his country.         
	Now England have alternatives, the selectors dont need to give Harmison any more chances.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

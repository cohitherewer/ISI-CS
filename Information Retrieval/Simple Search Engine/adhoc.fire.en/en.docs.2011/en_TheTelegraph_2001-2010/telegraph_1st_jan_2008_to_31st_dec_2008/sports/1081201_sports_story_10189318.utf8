	Harare: Nuwan Kulasekara picked up three wickets in 12 balls as Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe by 19 runs in their fifth and final one-day International on Sunday.         
	Zimbabwe were chasing 153 for victory and Keith Dabengwa (39) and captain Prosper Utseya (31) lifted them from 58 for six with a 72-run stand that left the hosts needing 23 for victory in 10 overs with four wickets in hand.         
	Dabengwa then stepped away and tried to carve Kulasekara through the off-side, only to be bowled. (REUTERS)

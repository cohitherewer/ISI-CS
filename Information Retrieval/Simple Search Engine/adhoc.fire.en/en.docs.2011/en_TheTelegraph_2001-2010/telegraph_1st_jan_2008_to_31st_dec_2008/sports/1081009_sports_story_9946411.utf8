The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ganguly deserved more respect, feels Chopra
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ganguly deserved more respect, feels Chopra
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Daniel Chopra in New Delhi on Wednesday                           
	New Delhi: India born Swedish golfer Daniel Chopra said he was hugely disappointed by Sourav Gangulys decision to quit international cricket at the end of the India-Australia series.         
	I am a big fan of Ganguly, said the US PGA Tour player, who grew up in the capital before turning professional in 1992. Chopra has returned to Delhi for the first time since 2001 to play in the Hero Honda Indian Open.         
	I like cricket and I watch the sport on the telly whenever I get a chance. I will catch some action before I tee off tomorrow (Thursday).         
	That would mean missing some practice but I dont mind, Chopra said on Wednesday.         
	I didnt like the way Ganguly was made to retire. I know he was obviously struggling for the past couple of years but he deserved more respect, Chopra commented.         
	The golfer said he considered the Calcutta based southpaw as one of the most respected members of Indian crickets fantastic five and the media here should not have gone after them.         
	The media should not hassle the senior cricketers. All of them have contributed a lot for the country, Chopra said.         
	I dont like the way the media went after them and asked them when they were going to retire. They are all senior cricketers and should be given the due respect. They deserve to play as long as they can contribute, Chopra felt.         
	If they are not performing, drop them. But please dont force them to retire. Can anyone forget how (Anil) Kumble captured 10 wickets in an innings? It played a big part in Indias victory, Chopra said.         
	I have an Australian wife but she gets no mercy for that. I am still going to support India and Delhi DareDevils, Chopra quipped.         
	Coming back to golf, Chopra said he had nostalgic feelings about playing at the Delhi Golf Club (DGC).         
	I remember growing up at this club, playing until the sun would set and it would become too dark to see.         
	A putting green which was my favourite is no longer there but I still remember playing for hours and hours during my childhood, he recalled.         
	The two-time PGA Tour winner said he was aware of his poor form and was making some changes in his technique.

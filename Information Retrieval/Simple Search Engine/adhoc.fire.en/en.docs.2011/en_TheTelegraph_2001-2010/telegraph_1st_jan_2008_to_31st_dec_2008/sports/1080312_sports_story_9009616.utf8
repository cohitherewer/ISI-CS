The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Colombian coach gets 11-match ban 
                                                   Colombian coach gets 11-match ban 
                      
	Bogota: America coach Diego Umana has been suspended for 11 matches for punching his Deportivo Cali rival Daniel Carreno during Saturdays Colombian championship match, when around 60 people were injured during a crowd riot.         
	The game at the Pascual Guerrero stadium in Cali was abandoned in the 82nd minute when riot police went onto the terraces to stop fighting amongst an organised group of America supporters known as the Red Baron.         
	Trouble also broke out on the pitch where Umana punched Uruguayan Carreno, who was knocked to the ground, got back on his feet, ran towards his aggressor but was restrained by Deportivo officials.         
	The Colombian league said on its website that Umana had been suspended for illegally entering the field and for violent conduct.         
	Diego Umana, coach of America, entered the field of play and hit Daniel Carreno in the face with his forearm and his elbow, knocking him to the ground, a statement said.         
	Umana has apologised for the incident, saying he did not realise that Carreno had been his victim.         
	Meanwhile, the Red Baron have been banned from entering the stadium for the next 10 games.         
	The incidents have sparked a nation-wide debate over increasing soccer violence in Colombia and a daily newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday that the measures did not go far enough.         
	The clubs, who stimulate and, in some cases, subsidise the organised supporters clubs with transport and free tickets, should also be answerable for this disgraceful situation, it said.         
	They share with the authorities the obligation to control the entry of weapons and alcohol into the stadiums.         
	Last year, police intercepted a bus carrying Independiente Medellin supporters to an away game in Cali and said they found an arsenal of weapons, including two revolvers, one hand grenade and 50 knives.

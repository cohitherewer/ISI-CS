  - Harbhajan, Ishant help visitors seal Thrilling victory in Galle             Ishant Sharma and Harbhajan Singh celebrate Indias win over Sri Lanka in Galle on Sunday. (AP)                           
	Galle: India made amends for the Colombo debacle trouncing Sri Lanka by 170 runs within four days to level the three-match Test series 1-1 here on Sunday.         
	After setting Sri Lanka a target of 307, Harbhajan Singh (4/51) and Ishant Sharma (3/20) bundled out the home team for a paltry 136 on a dramatic fourth day which saw as many as 16 wickets fall. Virender Sehwag was named Man of the Match.         
	It was a remarkable comeback by the Indians who were beaten comprehensively by an innings and 239 runs in the first Test in Colombo.         
	For Sri Lanka, Thilan Samaraweera (67 not out) stood tall amid the ruins. Tillekeratne Dilshan (38) also offered some resistance.         
	After setting the hosts a victory target of 307, Indias pace duo of Ishant and Zaheer Khan mowed down the Lankan top order. In fact, by the time Sri Lankas score reached double digits in the fourth over, the hosts were without in-form Malinda Warnapura (0), dependable Kumar Sangakkara (5) and batting mainstay and captain Mahela Jayawardene (5).                 
	 Samaraweera and Prasanna Jayawardene (4) tried to thwart the Indian attack as runs were not easy to come by with the pacers, especially Ishant, bending their back.         
	Earlier, India did manage to set the hosts a target of 307.         
	Sourav Ganguly gained from two referrals before being finally dismissed by Muralidharan. He had begun to walk after being adjudged leg before by Billy Doctrove but stopped after being apparently stopped by Karthik. As he chose to refer the decision, the third umpire ruled in the batsmans favour.         
	Later, Mark Benson ruled Sourav not out and Jayawardene went for the referral. Sourav benefited again as the third umpire went with the on-field umpires decision.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Croat spirit, Dutch flair in Dream XI

	A tournament so good that Uefa president Michel Platini describes it as sizzling, Euro 2008 produced a multitude of terrific individual displays in the group stage that deserve the formation of a dream XI.         
	Edwin van der Sar has impressed in goal for Holland, maintaining his good Manchester United form, but Gianluigi Buffon seizes the No. 1 slot for his consistent excellence, particularly that penalty save from Romanias Adrian Mutu to keep Italys hopes alive.         
	Slaven Bilic describes his Croatian defender, Vedran Corluka, as the best right-back in the world and the Manchester City mans displays have not mocked that billing. Giovanni van Bronckhorsts all-round contribution for Holland wins him the left-back slot.         
	His Dutch colleague, Andre Ooijer, has really caught the eye at centre-half, along with the enduring class of Portugals Ricardo Carvalho. With nods of respect to Italys Daniele de Rossi and Spains Xavi, the centre of the midfield must belong to Armando Petit. His unshowy work has yet to earn the Benfica player widespread acclaim, but he gives steel to Portugals silk factory. Alongside Petit is the captain, Michael Ballack, a real leader.         
	Ballack will push on, but there will be no shortage of creativity in the three-strong attacking trident strung out across the top of midfield.         
	Despite the contributions of Libor Sionko (Czech Republic), Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) and Franck Ribery (France), others make the dream team group-stage grade, beginning with Luka Modric. Croatias schemer-in-chief drifts around, fashioning openings with his touch and vision.         
	Deco brings even more invention, making it even more of a surprise that Barcelona are willing to sell.         
	Real Madrids pacy Wesley Sneijder, has provided a superb outlet for Holland down the left, showing his versatility by also moving inside when required by coach Marco van Basten.         
	Various high-class candidates offer themselves for the sole attacking role in this 4-2-3-1 formation.         
	Ruud van Nistelrooy has proved a significant force in Hollands success. Fernando Torres has performed similar important work for Spain, creating space and openings for others, particularly David Villa. Valencias hottest property proved the striker of the group stage with his predatory streak, quickening the pulses of everyone from Spanish fans to the scouts of leading Premier League clubs, and he deserves the all-star limelight.         
	There is no shortage of inspiring contenders to take charge of this team. Guus Hiddink has reminded the Football Association of his class with Russia. Luiz Felipe Scolari has formed an attractive Portuguese side.         
	But the all-star manager of the group stage must be Van Basten for the sheer effervescence, honesty and industry of his Dutch side.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Perth: January 14 may well come to be remembered as the Match Referees Day. 
    
	Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle will set the ball rolling by having one-on-ones with captains Anil Kumble and Ricky Ponting. 
    
	Later, hell have a closed-door meeting with both in attendance. 
    
	In the evening, the Match Referee for the ongoing Test series, Mike Procter, will conduct a hearing against Brad Hogg. 
    
	Australias left-arm spinner has been accused of abusing Kumble and vice-captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. If guilty, he faces a ban of between two and four Tests or between four and eight ODIs. 
    
	Madugalle has been rushed here by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to act as facilitator in the rebuilding of bridges between the Indians and Australians. 
    
	Relations have, of course, hit rock bottom after the last Test (Sydney) and the three-Test ban on Harbhajan Singh for calling Andrew Symonds a monkey. 
    
	Ideally, the Match Referee for the series shouldve been doing the task given to Madugalle... Procter has had to lump this decision taken by the ICC, a well-placed source remarked on Sunday evening. 
    
	Procter, understandably, declined to be drawn into a detailed comment when approached at the Hyatt Regency. 
    
	My lips are sealed... The past week has been tough... I cant answer whether Ive been put in an awkward position... But, yes, I had good relations with Kumble and Ponting, is all that he told The Telegraph. 
    
	Procters body language suggested he was carrying the weight of the cricket world on his shoulders. 
    
	Meanwhile, lines of communication are open between the Board of Control for Cricket in India and Cricket Australia over the possible diluting of Pontings racist charge against Harbhajan. 
    
	He has been banned, yes, but sources have confirmed that nothing prevents the complainant from either withdrawing or diluting the allegation even at the appeals stage. 
    
	The question being asked is: If the Australians make a gesture, will the Indians reciprocate on the Hogg issue? 
    
	Weve got to wait and watch.

	Hobart: Ian Healy on Monday defended Mahendra Singh Dhoni for wearing illegal gloves in Sydney saying that the manufacturers are to be blamed.         
	Healy, reportedly first to spot the fault in Dhonis gloves when the he took a catch to dismiss Adam Gilchrist off Sreesanth, also requested officials to be more perceptive in the situation.         
	I dont think Mahendra would have known, but his manufacturer would have, so thats where that one has gone astray, Healy said. All manufacturers were pulled in to line and had to get it right.         
	Healy agreed with Dhonis post-match explanation that he had worn those gloves earlier during the Tests and tri-series. Dhoni has been swapping those gloves. He has been interchanging between his white ones and his blue ones throughout the Test summer.

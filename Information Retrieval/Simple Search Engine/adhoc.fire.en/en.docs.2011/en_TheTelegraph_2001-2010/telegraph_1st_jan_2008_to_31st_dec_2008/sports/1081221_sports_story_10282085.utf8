The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tour off, more jobs likely to go
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tour off, more jobs likely to go
  - Grim days unlikely to end soon for troubled Pak board         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The cancellation of Team Indias tour of Pakistan, which was to begin in the first week of January, may (among other things) lead to more retrenchment in the cricket establishment there.         
	In recent weeks, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has sacked around 40 per cent of its employees... That number could go up as the cancellation is bound to hurt the establishment very hard, a well-placed source told The Telegraph from Karachi.         
	Apparently, the loss from TV rights alone is in the region of $30 million. Some of that will be recovered when Sri Lanka tours Pakistan, filling-in for India, but the PCB doesnt expect much from other rather routine revenue-earners like in-stadia advertising.         
	Clearly, the Sachin Tendulkars guarantee a much higher viewership and stronger returns than the Mahela Jayawardenes.         
	The source added: The fear is that Pakistans troubled establishment may go the way of the boards in the West Indies and Sri Lanka... The Lankans seem to be coming out of a mess, while the situation is still grave in the West Indies...         
	Besides the sackings, the PCB has launched an austerity drive and business class travel, for example, is out for most officials. Moreover, its departments have been directed to prepare fresh budgets for the remainder of the financial year.         
	Its quite likely that chairman Ejaz Butt is having sleepless nights.         
	Meanwhile, according to the source, plans had been finalised to host Team India at two neutral venues  the three-Test series in Colombo and the five ODIs (plus a one-off Twenty20) either in Abu Dhabi or Kuala Lumpur.         
	That got shelved once it became clear that New Delhi wouldnt okay any engagement even on neutral soil.         
	Tempers are too high... Also, you cant ignore the public mood... There are larger issues involved and the government doesnt have to be concerned about the relations between the two boards, is what a senior official said from New Delhi.         
	The last time that the government turned down a cricket-specific proposal involving Pakistan was in the autumn of 1999, after Kargil, when permission was denied for participating in yet another edition of the bilateral Sahara Cup in Toronto.         
	Thanks to the latest cancellation, the establishment in Pakistan is under immense pressure to act unilaterally on issues such as the Indian Cricket League rebels.         
	So much has, over the years, been made of Asian unity within the International Cricket Council... However, how can that be maintained when one neighbour wont visit the other? Worse for us, its now almost taken for granted that the Champions Trophy will be taken away, the Karachi-based source stated.         
	The Champions Trophy has already been postponed once.         
	While thats the mini World Cup, under threat too is the hosting of the showpiece event  the World Cup itself, in 2011, by the regions Big Four (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh).         
	Given the turn of events after the terror strikes in Mumbai, the 2015 hosts, Australia and New Zealand, must be sharpening knives to claim that edition.         
	Both, it may be recalled, had been more than just keen on 2011 in the build-up to the World Cup hosts roster being put in place, after much fierce lobbying, in early 2006.         
	The World Cup has been hosted twice by Asia (1987, 1996) and once by Australia-New Zealand (1992).

	Trescothick ends England career  London: Somerset batsman Marcus Trescothick announced his retirement from international cricket with England on Saturday due to health problems.  ldquo;My desire to play cricket is as strong as it ever was. But, due to the problems that I have experienced, travelling abroad has become extremely stressful for me, rdquo; he told Somerset rsquo;s website. Trescothick has long suffered from a stress-related illness and pulled out of England rsquo;s 2006 tours to India and Australia, where the tourists were thrashed in the Ashes series.  ldquo;I want to extend my playing career for as long as possible and I no longer want to put myself through the questions and demands that go with trying to return to the England team. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing for England, and I am very proud of having been selected for 76 Test matches and over 120 ODIs.  Trescothick said he would now ldquo;concentrate all my efforts on playing well for Somerset. It is a very big season for the club and I am looking forward very much to playing a full part. rdquo;  In his 76 Tests, Trescothick scored a total of 5,825 runs, at an average of 43.79. He played in 122 one-day International innings, getting 4,335 runs, with an average of 37.37.

	Flintoff comeback  London: England allrounder Andrew Flintoff said he hopes to return for England rsquo;s home Test against New Zealand at Lord rsquo;s on May 23.  The 30-year-old has not played a Test for England since last January in Australia because of continuing problems with his left-ankle, which was operated on for a fourth time in October. ldquo;I would love to play a Test match at Lord rsquo;s, but the one thing that I am not going to do is get carried away, rdquo; Flintoff was quoted as saying on the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in website on Saturday.  ldquo;I know that if I want to play for England, then I have got to be fit. rdquo; Flintoff said he still had some way to go to reach full fitness.

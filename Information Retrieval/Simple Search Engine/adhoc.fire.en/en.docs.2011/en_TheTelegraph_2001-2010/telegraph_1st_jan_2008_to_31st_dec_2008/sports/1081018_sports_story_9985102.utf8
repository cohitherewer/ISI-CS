The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangladesh 183/4
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bangladesh 183/4
                      
	Chittagong: Left-hander Mehrab Hossain capped his return to international cricket with a maiden half-century to help Bangladesh recover in the opening Test against New Zealand here on Friday.         
	The 21-year-old was on 79 not out to lift Bangladesh from a precarious 44/4 during an unbroken fifth-wicket stand of 139 with Mushfiqur Rahim (59 not out) to take the hosts to 183/4 at close on the opening day at the Divisional Stadium.         
	Mehrab played aggressively in an otherwise snail-paced batting performance by Bangladesh.

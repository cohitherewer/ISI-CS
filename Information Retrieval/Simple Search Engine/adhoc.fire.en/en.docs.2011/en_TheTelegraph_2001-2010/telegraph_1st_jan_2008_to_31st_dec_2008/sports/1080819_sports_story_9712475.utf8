Bolt still has to clear the clean line | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bolt still has to clear the clean line

	History suggests that there should be some nervous officials here until the drug test results from the mens 100 metres final are released later this week.         
	But there was little sign of it in the aftermath of Usain Bolts astonishing world record of 9.69sec in the Birds Nest Stadium.         
	Nick Davies, the communications director of the International Association of Athletics Federations, called Bolt the new hero the sport has been looking for.         
	An outstanding memory from the 1988 Games in Seoul was watching Ben Johnson slumped in the back seat of a limousine as he left the Olympic Stadium following the post-race drug test that would create the sports biggest doping scandal.         
	In contrast to Johnsons exit, Bolt left the Birds Nest with his team-mates, aboard the athletes bus with the sport still buzzing about his performance.         
	The Jamaicans have, however, been at the centre of the intensive drug-testing regime during these Olympics.         
	Bolts test after his victory was his seventh since he arrived and officials within the Jamaican camp were known to be unhappy about the scrutiny they had come under.         
	Don Anderson, the chef-de-mission, said the team had endured an extremely unusual number of drug tests in Beijing.         
	Speaking before the start of the athletics programme, he said the team had been tested 32 times in five days.         
	There were doubts expressed before the Games that Jamaica did not have an independent anti-doping agency but the worries were dismissed by the teams chief medical officer, Herb Elliott.         
	Confirmation that the Jamaicans are the leading force in world sprinting came again Sunday night with the countrys clean sweep of the womens 100m.         
	But it is Bolt, the first Jamaican to win the Olympic 100m title, who will continue to command centre stage with his assault on the 200m, which began earlier this morning and his attempt to add a third gold medal in the 4 x 100m relay at the end of the week.         
	Meanwhile, it was confirmed that Greeces Fani Halkia, the shock winner of the 400m hurdles at the Athens Games, will not defend her title in Beijing after testing positive for a banned substance. The Daily Telegraph

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Srinagar: Twenty-year-old Manipuri striker Souchungmi Relang scored a brilliant second half hattrick as Services shocked former champions Kerala 3-0 in the Group A quarter-final league match of the Santosh Trophy at the Bakshi Stadium on Saturday.         
	Relang, who so far has scored eight goals in the tournament, was at his rampaging best against Kerala, who were reduced to 10 men in the 18th minute after midfielder Rahul P was given the marching order for unfair tackles.         
	Relang put Services in the lead in the 65th minute and then struck two more in the 74th and 85th minute to complete the hattrick.         
	Services now have six points from two matches and have the best chance to go into the semi-finals from group A.         
	The days other Group A match between hosts Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab had to be postponed after the crowd invaded the field in the 68th minute. Punjab were leading 1-0 then. Midfielder Sukhwinder Singh scored the goal in the 65th minute.         
	The remaining 22 minutes of the match will be played on Sunday morning at 8 am.         
	Sundays matches: Bengal vs Karnataka (2.15 pm); Goa vs Maharashtra (4.15pm).

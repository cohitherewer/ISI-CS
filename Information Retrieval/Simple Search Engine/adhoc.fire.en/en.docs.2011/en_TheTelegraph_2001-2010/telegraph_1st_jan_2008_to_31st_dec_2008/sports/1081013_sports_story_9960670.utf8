                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dempo get past Vasco 
                      
	Margao: Defending champions Dempo edged past a fighting Vasco 2-1 to register their first win of the ONGC I-league played at Nehru stadium in Fatorda Sunday.         
	Dempo scored their goals through Roberto Silva (24th) and Ranty Martins (30th). Dempo, who lost to JCT in their first match, have collected three points from two matches. While Vasco, who suffered their second defeat, have one point from three matches. Vasco reduced the margin through their Uzbekistan striker Ravshan Teshabaev.         
	The win is a morale booster for Dempo who play their return match against Safa SC of Lebanon in the semi-finals of the AFC Cup on October 21. Dempo made an impressive start as their midfield combined well with their strikers with quick short passes.         
	Anthony Pereira troubled the rival defence with overhead crosses as Dempo kept Vasco under pressure for the first 30 minutes (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Srebotnik shows Serena the door
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Srebotnik shows Serena the door

	Paris: For Serena Williams, missed chances came in a flurry on Friday at the French Open. She shanked overheads, hit wild volleys and squandered seven break points. And the net result was a stunning third round loss to Slovenias Katarina Srebotnik 6-4, 6-4.         
	The hasty exit matches Williams earliest in nine visits to Roland Garros and guarantees a first time womens champion. Williams, who won the French Open in 2002, was the lone former champion to enter the draw.         
	I missed a lot of easy shots and a lot of key points that I felt could have turned the match around, a subdued Williams said shortly after the loss. I wasnt able to capitalise.         
	Williams also lost in the third round in 1999. The 27-year-old Srebotnik earned the biggest victory of her career.         
	The three time defending champion Rafael Nadal played for the fourth consecutive day in the rain-interrupted tournament and beat Jarkko Nieminen 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 in the third round.         
	Nadal, who has been bothered this spring by a blister on his right foot, won easily despite needing treatment by a trainer after the second set.         
	 The top-seeded Maria Sharapova and world No. 2 Ana Ivanovic advanced. In the completion of a second round match that was halted in the second set on Thursday because of darkness, Sharapova beat American Bethanie Mattek 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.         
	Sharapova won despite ten double faults, giving her 27 in two matches. She finished with 51 unforced errors as she struggled to find a comfort level on clay, her least favourite surface.         
	 The French Open is the only Grand Slam she has yet to win. Youre going to have to hit more balls, and youre going to have to move a few extra steps to the ball, Sharapova said.         
	You have to be more patient. Im definitely getting better at that, and Im getting smarter out there.         
	Ivanovic reached the fourth round by beating 17-year-old Caroline Wozniacki 6-4, 6-1. Williams, who played the days first match on Court Suzanne Lenglen, converted only one of eight break point chances and was 0 for 6 in the second set. She repeatedly set up points well but failed to finish them, losing 14 of 21 points at the net.         
	There are a lot of things that I would try to do different, but you cant rewind time, the American said.         
	Her mother and coach, Oracene Price, said Williams has been in a funk. Its not like her. She wasnt herself. Williams was less gracious in her post match news conference, explaining her demeanour by saying, I just dont want to be here.         
	 In the final game of the first set, Williams dumped an easy overhead into the net. Four points later, she worked her way forward but blew a volley, then bent over in dismay and pressed her forehead against the tip of her racket handle. I wasnt nervous, Williams said.         
	 Today I woke up and it was just another opportunity. This is what you work so hard for  to be in third round where you play Serena or someone like that and you have really nothing to lose, the excited Srebotnik said.         
	Meanwhile, No. 11 Vera Zvonareva beat Stephanie Cohen-Aloro 6-4, 6-2. In the completion of a second round match, No. 25 Nadia Petrova swept Alisa Kleybanova 6-3, 6-3. (AP)

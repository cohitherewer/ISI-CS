The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All eyes on Diego
                                                                                                                                                                                                       All eyes on Diego
                  Diego Maradona                     
	London: Diego Maradonas first match as coach of Argentina eclipses even the latest chapter in the long history of Germany versus England confrontations.         
	The football great, whose Hand of God goal against England 22 years ago helped Argentina to a World Cup triumph, is now trying to work his magic from the bench and starts against Scotland in Glasgow on Wednesday.         
	The football powerhouses of Europe and South America break off from World Cup qualifying this week either to maintain form or experiment with new players. But the outcome is that some of the biggest stars  from David Beckham to Ronaldinho  wont be in action on Wednesday.         
	The schedule in Europe includes 25 friendly games and a single World Cup qualifier between San Marino and the Czech Republic in Group 3. Thats the last Europe-based World Cup qualifier of 2008. The Czech team, next-to-last in the group, need to win the game to make ground on pacesetters Slovakia, Poland and Slovenia.         
	Maradona is the latest to try his hand at what should be one of the best jobs in world football but has turned to be one of the toughest. A series of coaches have failed to lift a hugely talented Argentina squad to World Cup success and now its the turn of the nations greatest player.         
	He arrived in Glasgow on Sunday ahead of his first match on Wednesday against Scotland at Hampden Park and now he waits to see which of his stars  from Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez to Juan Roman Riquelme  will arrive fit for the game.         
	England are riding high after winning their first four World Cup qualifying games. Head coach Fabio Capello wants to maintain that form, having inherited a team low in confidence after failing to qualify for Euro 2008.         
	I think we are a very good team, he said. We can play against all the countries at the same level.         
	But he is forced to face the Germans in Berlin without several injured stars, including Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard. He has also chosen to leave out striker Michael Owen because of a lack of fitness and form and Beckham because he has been inactive since the Los Angeles Galaxys failure to reach the American MLS playoffs.         
	While Capello has won over the England players with his methodical approach to training and restricting their showbiz lifestyles, Germany coach Joachim Loew has had disputes with Michael Ballack and Torsten Frings over the extent of their injuries.         
	Neither will face England and Loew plans to talk to all his players about how he expects them to keep him informed about their fitness.         
	He is also wary of Englands new-found strength. England is the team of the moment, said Loew, who led his team to a comfortable 2-1 victory at Wembley in August 2007 when a floundering Steve McClaren was in charge of England.         
	World Cup holders Italy go to former European champions Greece without Alessandro del Piero, even though the veteran striker scored three of Juventus four goals in their two Champions League victories over Real Madrid. With 27 goals, he is Italys most active scorer, and eight short of Luigi Rivas national record of 35.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal in do-or-die battle
                                                                                                                                                                                           Bengal in do-or-die battle
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Srinagar: Biscoe High School is Srinagars oldest educational institution. Established in 1880, the school has a sprawling football ground, a well-maintained cricket field, a basketball court and a neat 25-metre swimming pool.         
	On Saturday morning, two teams were practising on either side of the football ground.         
	On one side, the Bengal coach, Krishnendu Roy was busy shouting instructions to his boys, who take on Karnataka in the crucial Santosh Trophy group league match on Sunday.         
	On the other side were a bunch of students from the school, who were kicking the ball around with great enthusiasm.         
	We know about only one Indian footballer, that is Bhaichung Bhutia, said a boy, who seemed to be a good dribbler of the ball.         
	So far, the locals here havent really thronged the ground except for matches involving the home state.         
	Roy is confident that Bengal will cross the hurdle. It doesnt matter that we drew against Goa, he said. My boys will definitely turn it around against Karnataka.         
	The 29-time champions are likely to make two to three changes from the team that played against Goa. Goalkeeper Abhra Mondal, who is yet to recover fully from the eye injury he suffered on Friday, is sure to make way for Somnath Khara. In the forward line, Roy said he would bring in Syed Rahim Nabi in place of Tarif Ahmed.         
	Team sources said that there is a possibility that Tapan Maity may come in place of Snehasis Chakrabarty.         
	The draw against Goa has pushed the last years runner-up into a kind of must-win situation. For Bengal, winning the title after eight years could be the only way out to attract attention in the midst of Euro Cup.

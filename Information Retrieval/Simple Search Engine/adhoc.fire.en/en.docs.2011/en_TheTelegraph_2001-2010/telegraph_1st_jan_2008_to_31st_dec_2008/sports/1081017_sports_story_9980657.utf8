The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CA brass in full strength
                                                                                                                                                                                                     CA brass in full strength
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Chandigarh: The outgoing chairman of Cricket Australia (CA), Creagh Connor, and chairman-designate Jack Clarke are both in town for the second Test, to be played in neighbouring Mohali.         
	Creagh will use the occasion to introduce his successor to the Indian Board, former Board president Inderjit Singh Bindra told The Telegraph.         
	The formal introduction will be done over dinner on Friday, Day I of the second Test. Board president Shashank Manohar, for one, is already in Chandigarh.         
	Bindra has, of course, played a big role in furthering ties between the BCCI and CA.         
	The relationship actually began to improve during the time Jagmohan Dalmiya and Bob Merriman were at the helm in India and Australia, respectively.

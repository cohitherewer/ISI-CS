The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Amarnath named Bengal consultant
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Amarnath named Bengal consultant
            A STAFF REPORTER                                Mohinder Amarnath    
	Calcutta: Mohinder Amarnath was named consultant of the senior Bengal side for the ensuing season. CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya announced this after a working committee meeting on Monday. Apart from working with the senior side, Amarnath will also look after district and University cricket in the state.         
	At a press meet, Dalmiya said that the coachs position would be shortly filled by someone from the state itself. It was learnt that Devang Gandhi and Utpal Chatterjee are in the running for the post.         
	Chinmoy Roy was appointed fitness trainer while Srinivas Rao steps in as a physio for the Bengal team. Prabir Mukherjee returns as curator at the Eden Gardens replacing Kalyan Mitra.         
	Naresh Ojha and Debabrata Das were appointed as honorary assistant secretaries while Goutam Das Gupta was co-opted in the working committee. The issue about some senior Bengal players not being happy about playing in the Plate Division in the Ranji Trophy, and therefore mulling a move elsewhere seems to have been resolved. Seven players including Manoj Tiwary, Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul and Laxmi Ratan Shukla have written to the CAB president pledging to do their best to bring back the glory to Bengal cricket.         
	Dalmiya also announced the revival of the Talent Resource Development Officials (TRDO) which was initiated by the BCCI a few years back but discontinued later. Russi Jeejeebhoy will head the TRDO committee as its chairman. A Development and Programme Implementation Committee (DPIC) has been formed comprising Das Gupta, Hiranmoy Chatterjee and Chiranjit Bose.         
	It was decided at the meeting that all CAB members, including former cricketers, would be given free tickets for matches at the Eden. On the issue of renewal of Edens lease, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya said that talks are still on with the ministry of defence. We want the lease but on commercial terms basisthe negotiations should be completed in another two months.

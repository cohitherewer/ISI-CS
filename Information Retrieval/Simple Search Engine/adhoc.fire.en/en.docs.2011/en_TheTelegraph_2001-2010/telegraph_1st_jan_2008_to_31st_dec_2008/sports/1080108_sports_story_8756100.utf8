	Kapalua (US): Swede Daniel Chopra held his nerve in fading light to beat American Steve Stricker in a play-off for the PGA Tours season-opening Mercedes-Benz Championship on Sunday. 
    
	The Stockholm native birdied the fourth extra hole at Kapalua Resorts Plantation Course to earn the winners cheque for $1.1 million and his second Tour title. 
    
	Both players missed birdie opportunities from around six feet at the first play-off hole before Chopra sealed victory with a two-putt birdie at the par-five ninth, his eagle attempt having come to rest on the edge of the cup. 
    
	It was the seventh play-off in the last 14 years at the event which brings together the title-holders from the previous Tour season. 
    
	The pair had completed the 72 regulation holes in 18-under-par 274 on a sun-kissed day on the Hawaiian island of Maui, Chopra carding a 66 and Stricker finishing birdie-birdie-par-birdie for a 64. 
    
	It was unbelievable, a beaming Chopra told reporters after delivering a master class with his putter to book his place at the Masters for the first time. 
    
	What a great round I played today. I kept making birdies and I tried to avoid looking up at the board. I looked a couple of times and I saw I had the lead and then I looked up again and all of a sudden Stricker kept making them (birdies). 
    
	Chopra, who had narrowly missed a 13-footer to seal victory at the 72nd hole, fell agonisingly short with a 24-footer for birdie on the second extra hole. 
    
	All those putts in the play-off and in regulation, I thought I hit superb strokes, he added. 
    
	Im awfully happy. Now I get to go to Augusta, my lifelong dream. 
    
	For much of the day, Chopra had been in control. 
    
	He set the tone by holing a 45-footer to birdie the par-three second and picked up further shots at the third, fifth and seventh to reach the turn in four-under 32. 
    
	He rolled in another monster putt at the par-three 11th, from 30 feet, before stretching his lead to three with additional birdies at the 12th and 13th. 
    
	However the Swede failed to take advantage of the par-five 15th as Stricker, who had holed out from the fairway to eagle the par-four 12th, piled on the pressure. 
    
	A two-putt birdie at the 15th put the American two strokes behind and he forced the play-off with further birdies on 16 and at the last, where he coolly sank a 12-footer. 
    
	A little disappointing but Im very happy with the way I played this week, Stricker said after failing in his bid to win a fifth PGA Tour title. 
    
	Canadian Stephen Ames, who hit the opening drive of the 2008 PGA Tour on Thursday, birdied four of the last six holes for a 66 and third place at 17 under. 
    
	Compatriot Mike Weir, the third-round leader, was a further stroke back in fourth having lost ground with two bogeys in the first four holes on his way to a 70.

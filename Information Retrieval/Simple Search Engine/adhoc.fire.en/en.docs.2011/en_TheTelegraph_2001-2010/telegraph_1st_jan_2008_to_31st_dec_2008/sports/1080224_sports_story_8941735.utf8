The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Johnson misses out on $500,000
                                                   Johnson misses out on $500,000
                      
	Melbourne: Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnsons decision to miss the IPL had cost him $500,000, a report has claimed.         
	While several of Australias top cricketers joined the lucrative league, Michael Clarke, Johnson and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin decided to stay away from it to focus on their international careers.         
	A report in an Australian daily claimed that Clarke stood to earn $800,000 a season had he entered the IPL bidding frenzy.         
	Quoting IPL chairman Lalit Modi, the report claimed that Johnson would have commanded enormous interest during the February 20 auction in Mumbai, considering that pacer Brett Lee was bought by Mohali team for a staggering $900,000.

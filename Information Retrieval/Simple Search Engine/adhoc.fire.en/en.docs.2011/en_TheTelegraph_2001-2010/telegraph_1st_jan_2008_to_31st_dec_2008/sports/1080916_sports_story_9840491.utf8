The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Imran Ali hattrick 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Imran Ali hattrick 
                      
	New Delhi: Paceman Imran Ali starred by picking a brilliant six for 52, including a hat-trick, as Pakistans Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited rolled over Delhi for 134 runs before the hosts struck in time to do the damage control on the opening day of the Mohammad Nissar Trophy cricket match here.         
	Imran Ali was well supported by fellow pacer Asad Ali, who scalped 3 for 32, as the duo exploited the conditions well after Delhi captain Virender Sehwag had won the toss and elected to bat in the rain-affected four-day match at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground.         
	After the Ranji champions were skittled out in just 36.3 overs, comeback man Ashish Nehra (3-36), returning after missing the previous season, and Chetanya Nanda (2-1) did well to restrict the Quaid-e-Azam champions Pakistani team for 143 for six in 38 overs.         
	Earlier, none of the Delhi batsman, barring Virat Kohli (52) and Mithun Manhas (49), could stay for long at the crease. Delhi got off to a shaky start as openers Aakash Chopra (4) and Sehwag (0) returned to the pavilion with just four runs on the board in 4.1 overs.

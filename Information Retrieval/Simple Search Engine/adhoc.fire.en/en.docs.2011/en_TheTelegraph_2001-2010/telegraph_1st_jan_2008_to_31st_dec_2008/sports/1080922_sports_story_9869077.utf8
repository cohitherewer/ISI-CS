The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cricket too could have been hit by tragedy
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cricket too could have been hit by tragedy
    - Marriott would have been one of the hotels for champions trophy             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            The lobby of the devastated Marriott in Islamabad. (AFP)                                 
	Calcutta: Those of us whove stayed at the deluxe Marriott in Islamabad find it difficult believing that Pakistans most secure (and, arguably, the best managed) hotel has been reduced to such a state of devastation.         
	Security in star properties across Pakistan is of the highest order, but it would usually be more stringent at the Marriott, as it regularly hosted heads of state and government who came calling on the capital.         
	High profile cricket teams too.         
	Indeed, were lucky that the International Cricket Council (ICC) struck off neighbouring Rawalpindi as a Champions Trophy venue and that the tournament itself got put off by a year.         
	Had the original plan been followed and the ICC (under pressure from the Asian quartet) stuck to its guns, theres a good chance that some teams and officials would have been at the Marriott on Saturday.         
	Its a shiver-inducing thought.         
	While Rawalpindis Cricket Stadium stages international matches, its Islamabad which hosts the teams, with the Marriott being the preferred hotel.         
	The hotel-stadium drive normally takes around 40 minutes.         
	Yes, the Marriott would certainly have been one of the hotels for the Champions Trophy, confirmed ICC spokesman Brian Murgatroyd, when The Telegraph contacted him on the morning after the suicide attack which left 53 dead and hundreds wounded.         
	The spokesman also confirmed that reservations over security in Rawalpindi/Islamabad (the latter saw a suicide attack on the day of the Asia Cup final, July 6) had prompted the ICC to cut the venues to two  Lahore, where the Pakistan Cricket Board is headquartered, and Karachi.         
	Youll appreciate that its easier to look after teams in two cities instead of three... We made that change (towards the end of July) to allay the misgivings of some teams, Murgatroyd said.         
	That didnt stop South Africa from pulling out, though, a decision which eventually led to the tournament being postponed big.         
	The Marriott, in fact, is where Team India stayed on the last two full tours of Pakistan  in 2003-04 and, then, in 2005-06.         
	A few things come instantly to mind.         
	Thanks to the jammers, the cellphones never worked inside the hotel. Then, the 24-hour coffee shop off the lobby would (on request) serve delicious vegetarian thalis, the kind to match even the most mouth-watering on offer anywhere in India.         
	Incidentally, late at night, the coffee shop attracted many of the most influential and the most beautiful around Islamabad.         
	The Marriott, essentially, was quite a happening place and, with a high degree of VIP movement within, it would be mandatory for resident-guests to have some identification on them all the time.         
	Borders blur when tragedy strikes and one hopes that nobody from the staff, who served us efficiently and so courteously, was a victim of Saturdays madness.

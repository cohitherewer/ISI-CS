                                                   Uzbeks to import special shoes for grass courts

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	New Delhi: Uzbekistan tennis star Farrukh Dustov is planning on importing special shoes from California ahead of the Davis Cup tie against India. 
    
	The move comes after Indian skipper Leander Paes said on Sunday that the visitors shoes were not ideal for play on grass courts. Those shoes are only fitted for clay courts, he said. 
    
	Dustov, who is desperate to end Uzbekistans dismal record on grass, said that he had had a talk with Paes on Sunday night. He told me that our shoes would create problems on grass courts. So, we have already ordered shoes. It should arrive in a day or two, he said. 
    
	Denis Istomin, however, was not fully convinced by what Paes had to say. I checked my shoes. These are good on both grass and clay courts. I am not facing any problem. 
    
	While the Uzbeks grappled with the shoe problem, former India captain Naresh Kumar was at nets during Indias practice session. 
    
	Asked about Indias chances, Naresh said it was not going to be an easy outing for them. 
    
	India are definitely favourites on grass but that doesnt mean it is going to be easy, he said. It could be tough, especially with Istomin around. 
    
	With Leander not playing, a lot will depend on Rohan (Bopanna), he added. I am sure he will play singles and also the doubles. He is an improved player though he can still be better. He has the ability to go to the next level. 
    
	Paes, in the meantime, had a look at the DLTA courts and didnt seem too satisfied. 
    
	I had a look at the court. It has long grass, Paes said. I have asked them to chop it off. They are watering the surface though I dont know how much water the surface will absorb. I know there is a concrete surface underneath. 
    
	Bopanna, Ashutosh Singh and Vishnu Vardhan practised on Monday. Prakash Amritraj was down with stomach upset. Mahesh Bhupathi and Somdev Dev Varman are expected to join the squad on Tuesday.

            A STAFF REPORTER                Mehtab Hossain on way to scoring the first goal for East Bengal on Monday.   A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: City giants East Bengal started their campaign in the Premier Division of the Sahara Calcutta Football League with a 2-0 win over minnows Calcutta Port Trust but were largely unimpressive.         
	The match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday was a completely one-sided one, with Port barely creating a couple of chances throughout the match and the red-and-gold brigade missing an array of sitters.         
	For the record, the goals came in either side of the breather for East Bengal. Mehtab Hossain scored the first in the eighth minute while Chhangte Malsawmkima rounded off the tally in the 73rd.         
	In the otherwise insipid football that was on offer, veteran Alvito DCunha was the most impressive of the lot. It seemed like something was on the cards whenever the ball reached DCunhas feet. The left-footed midfielder led East Bengal superbly, sending across brilliant crosses and defence splitting passes.         
	However, the Man-of-the-Match award went to Jayanta Sen, which raised quite a few eyebrows.         
	The first goal came from a similar chip from DCunha with the Port defence caught stranded, trying an offside-trap. Mehtab kept a cool head to beat an advancing Gopal Das.         
	After the first goal, it was all about East Bengal striker Ashim Biswas. Ashim, who has recently come off an injury, missed a number of sitters. In the 39th minute, he hit the crossbar with only the goalkeeper at his mercy. Mehtab had set up Ashim with a scorching through, with the Port defence again caught on the wrong foot.         
	Youngster Sanju Pradhan also impressed with his burst of pace and ball control down the right wing. But Sanju needs to hone his distribution skills if he wants to be a better winger.         
	Substitute Malsawmkima scored the second goal of the match from a goalmouth melee. DCunhas shot was saved by Gopal and the rebound reached Malsawmkima, who shot home.         
	Port, coached by former Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharjee, also missed a couple of chances, with Raman Vijayan being the offender on most occasions.         
	Port provided too much space for the East Bengal midfield to operate freely and will also have to tighten their defence if they wish to finish respectably at the end of the league.

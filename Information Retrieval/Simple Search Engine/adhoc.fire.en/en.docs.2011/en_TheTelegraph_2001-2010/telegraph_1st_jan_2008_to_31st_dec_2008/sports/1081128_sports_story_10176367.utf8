The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ACA left in the lurch
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ACA left in the lurch
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: The disturbing events in Mumbai saw the BCCI cancel the sixth one-day International against England at the Nehru Stadium here on Saturday.         
	Putting an end to frenzied speculation here surrounding the fate of the match since morning, ACA secretary Bikash Baruah stated at a hurriedly-called press conference that the BCCI formally informed the association around 2.45 pm that the match stood cancelled on the request of the ECB.         
	It is very unfortunate. The match here on November 29 has been cancelled. We will start reimbursing the ticket amount from Monday to Wednesday at the Judges Field every day from 11 am, Baruah said in company of other senior officials of the association.         
	Reassuring the disappointed cricket-loving fans of the state, the ACA said it would request the BCCI to compensate Guwahati with another ODI fixture. We will request the BCCI to give us first preference when the next round of ODI venues are finalised. However, we will want the match only in the months of November and December to avoid the rain, Baruah added.

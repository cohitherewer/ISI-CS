            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagans Jose Ramirez Barreto stretches during practice at the club ground on Saturday.   A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Supporters of both Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting will be hoping for a turnaround in the fortunes of their respective clubs as they take on each other in the I-League on Sunday. The top two of the Calcutta league are languishing at the bottom of the I-League table with a point each from three matches.         
	While a good start is of paramount importance in any marathon league, the two sides from Calcutta have been unlucky to be saddled with injuries to key players.         
	Bagan, who have thus far failed to secure the services of Marcos Pereira from JCT, and are still without a third foreigner, will miss Bhaichung Bhutia, Sangram Mukherjee, Habibur Rehman and P.C. Lalawmpuiya for the game against Shabbir Alis side.         
	To make matters worse coach Karim Bencharifa himself has joined the list of casualties with a suspected broken arm after falling down during Saturdays practice session.         
	If the strains which were showing on Bencharifa after the away loss to Sporting Clube de Goa are not to be compounded, the green-and-maroon brigade will have to find the way to the goal. Relying solely on Jose Ramirez Barreto will certainly not do.         
	Flying winger Ishfaq Ahmed might be the man to bail Bencharifa out. The man from Kashmir is likely to play in a supporting role upfront alongside Barreto.         
	The inexperience in the middle third has cost Bagan dearly in the first three ties, and Bencharifa would be hoping that the young Rakesh Masihs, Lalramluahas and James Singhs have a confident outing.         
	Peter Odafe could be the key man, both in terms of defensive responsibilities and in terms of his long throws. Deepak Mondal, Anand Vasan and Mohan Raj will complete the back four. The Mohammedan Sporting camp will once again pin their hopes on the deadly strike pair of Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday. Both are expected to start the match despite carrying injuries. The weakness of the Calcutta teams bench has already been exposed.         
	The leaky Mohammedan Sporting defence having conceded six goals in three matches, will be put under more pressure as Sheikh Azim and Prem Kumar are out with injuries.         
	Shabbir Ali will also be hoping that Adebayo Adewusi has a commanding presence in the midfield. The lively Jyothi Kumar holds the ability to liven up the game if the going gets tough.         
	Among Gurpreet Singh, Bijoy Das or the on-loan Madhab Das, the two wholl play in the heart of defence, will have to be on top of their game.         
	Had Bagan had the likes of Bhaichung or Lalwampuiya in their ranks to support Barreto, it would have been a classic case of a thoroughbred attack attempting to breach an uncertain backline.         
	On Sunday evening though, it wouldnt be surprising if Okoro and Sunday choose to turn it on against Bagan.         
	Incidentally, Bagan didnt manage a win against Shabbirs men in either of their two CFL encounters. Sunday had scored on both occasions.  
	KEY MEN  
	 MOHUN BAGAN  Jose Ramirez Barreto: A supporting striker by his side would certainly have helped him, but rest assured this Brazilian will give it his all, come what may. A snap shot or a sharp turn mdash; a moment of magic from Barreto can turn the match in no time.  Peter Odafe: Would have to be alert and accurate in his movements to keep Okoro and Sunday at bay. Co-ordination with his defensive partner must also be maintained at all times. Odafe can also make a difference with his long, arching throws into the opposition penalty box.  
	 Mohammedan Sporting  Theodore Sunday: Struggling with an injury, the Liberian may not be at his sharpest best. But with predatory instincts and a wily brain, Sunday can yet be a handful for the Bagan defence. His understanding with Mike Okoro can make a difference.  Mike Okoro: The Nigerian will once again operate from a withdrawn position as he did so successfully in the local league. Okoro can also be deadly, striking home from set-pieces.

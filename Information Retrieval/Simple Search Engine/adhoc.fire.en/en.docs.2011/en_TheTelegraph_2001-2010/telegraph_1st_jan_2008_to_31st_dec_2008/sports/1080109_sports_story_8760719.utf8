The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Procter was under pressure after being ticked off
                                                Procter was under pressure after being ticked off
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                      Mike Procter    
	Calcutta: The body language of Match Referee Mike Procter during Sunday nights disciplinary hearing in Sydney had been such that it appeared he was under pressure to punish Harbhajan Singh.         
	Procter, clearly, looked under pressure to act... That impression was unmistakable, somebody who attended the hearing told The Telegraph.         
	Harbhajan, as it turned out, got banned for three Tests when the one-time South African allrounder and coach held him guilty of hurling a racist abuse at Andrew Symonds.         
	Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, the gentleman added: I wouldnt like to speculate on the reason, but Procters behaviour couldve had something to do with an incident in the lead-up to the second Test (at the SCG)...         
	Procter declined to comment. Contacted in Sydney, he merely said: I dont wish to say anything except that the last two days have been distressing... I hope you understand its a delicate time.         
	Tough times is more like it. For, soon after Procter spoke to this newspaper, he learnt that Chief Referee Ranjan Madugalle would join him before the next Test (in Perth) as facilitator.         
	At the very least, its a lack of confidence in him from the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	The incident between the first (MCG) and second Tests, one learns, relates to Procter being ticked off by ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed for giving Yuvraj Singh a clean chit.         
	Yuvraj, whod stood his ground in the first innings at the MCG, was charged with showing dissent but Procter accepted his plea that hed shown disappointment and not dissent.         
	That didnt amuse Speed.         
	Talking exclusively during the SCG Test, Speed said: Ive had a chat with Procter... Im not in favour of redefining dissent. If a batsman waits at the crease after being given out then its dissent, not disappointment.         
	Nothing stops the chief executive from having a word with any Match Referee, but the ticking off wouldve put Procter under pressure to act in the next hearing involving an Indian.         
	Speed has, over the years, been viewed with suspicion by the Indian Board and the present regime played its part in ensuring the Australian didnt get another extension.         
	So, later this year, the ICC will have a new chief executive and some with big influence are lobbying for an Asian to succeed Speed.         
	Footnote: That Procter disregarded the independent testimony of on-field umpires Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson, both of whom maintained they hadnt heard the word monkey, will form an integral part of Harbhajans strong counter to the ban.

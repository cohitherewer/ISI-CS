The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United in woes: Sir Alex, Capello
                                                                                                                                                                                                     United in woes: Sir Alex, Capello

	Except that the admirably trained sniffer dog in question was not Owen Hargreaves, of Manchester United, but Zenit St Petersburgs captain and man of the match, Anatoliy Tymoschuk, who, as if to heap further frustration on the near-inscrutable Italian plotting Englands path to the World Cup finals, is from Ukraine and therefore scheduled to play against England in the forthcoming qualifying series.         
	While Hargreaves, his knee problem having obstinately refused to yield to months of treatment, slipped wordlessly out of the Louis II Stadium  even the most affable of footballers, it seems, must conform to Uniteds habit of treating such disappointments as failure to win the Super Cup as an excuse to be ill-mannered  Capello reconsidered his options for the trip to Croatia, where his predecessor, Steve McClaren, incurred a significant contribution to the failure to reach Euro 2008.         
	Hargreaves would have been ruled out in any case by Sir Alex Ferguson, whose own irascibility on Friday night may have owed something to a dearth of midfield resources that his pursuit of the striker Dimitar Berbatov has overshadowed. Further bad news for bothFerguson and Capello is the temporary loss of Michael Carrick.         
	On their Super Cup form, United would not trouble any of their main rivals; it made a mockery of the managers claim that, having undervalued the event last time, he would pick his strongest team. No wonder Ferguson was so keen to keep Cristiano Ronaldo.         
	The sooner Berbatov and Wayne Rooney are in tandem, the better for United, whom Steven Gerrard is desperate to be fit to face on what could be a fateful 13th of September. The Liverpool captain was fully entitled, by the way, to remind Capello, who had appeared to question the timing of his operation with Andorra next Saturday and then Croatia looming, that his first loyalty was to his club.         
	The silver lining in Gerrards absence from the first two qualifiers is that Frank Lampard can have the attacking-midfield stage. Gareth Barry should be able to do the holding job alone against Andorra, but Capello will have to bring in someone to help him against Croatia.         
	It is not a position in which the English are overburdened with riches and probably the best bet, given that only Hargreaves has regularly displayed the characteristics that rendered Tymoschuk such a barrier to United on Friday, would be Jermaine Jenas. Someone must do it  and Jenas has the virtue of discipline.

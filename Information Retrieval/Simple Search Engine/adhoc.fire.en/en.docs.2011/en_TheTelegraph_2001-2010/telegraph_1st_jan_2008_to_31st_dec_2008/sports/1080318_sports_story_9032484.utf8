                                                   RP, Ojha   shine in Central win
                            
	Bangalore: Opener Naman Ojha hit a century and R.P. Singh claimed a five-wicket haul as Central Zone defeated Virender Sehwag-led North by 70 runs in the second round of the Inter-Zonal one-day tournament for the Deodhar Trophy at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Monday.         
	Sent in to bat, central zone hit an imposing 293 for three in their 50 overs. Ojha top-scored with a sparkling 110 made off 130 deliveries with ten fours and two sixes.         
	Ojha laid a solid foundation for the Mohammed Kaifs outfit, sharing a first wicket stand of 163 runs with Faiz Fazal who scored 66 in 93 balls with four fours. North started on a disastrous note, losing four batsmen with just 12 runs on the board.         
	R.P. produced an impressive burst that saw Shikar Dhawan, Gautam Gambhir and Rajat Bhatia back in the pavilion without scoring in his very first over. Singh then trapped Aakash Chopra lbw for 11 leaving the side in a tightspot.

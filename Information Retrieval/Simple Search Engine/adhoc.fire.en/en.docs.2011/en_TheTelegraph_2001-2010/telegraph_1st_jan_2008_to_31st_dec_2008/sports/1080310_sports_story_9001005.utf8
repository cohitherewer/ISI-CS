The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal pockets title in play-off
                                                     Atwal pockets title in play-off
                  Jyoti Randhawa carded 71 for a share of the sixth place                     
	Kuala Lumpur: Arjun Atwal got a huge monkey off his back after edging out defending champion Peter Hedblom of Sweden in a gripping play-off to win his second Malaysian Open title on Sunday.         
	This was for the second month in a row that an Indian laid his fingers on a European Tour title. Fellow Calcutta-pro S.S.P. Chowrasia had won the Indian Masters at the Delhi Golf Club last month.         
	Recently exonerated from vehicular homicide charges from a road accident in Orlando last year, Atwal on Sunday played like a man possessed and birdied half the holes in a sizzling round of 64 to join Hedblom at 18-under 270 to force a playoff.         
	There on the second extra hole, Hedblom three-putted for a bogey, while Atwal held his nerve and sank a four-footer at the short 17th to clinch the title.         
	This was Atwals third European Tour title and the Indian pocketed euro 219,483 for his exploits.         
	Apart from his two Malaysian Open titles, Atwal had also won the 2002 Caltex Singapore Masters.         
	Atwal also came close to equalling Simon Yates 1999 course record of nine-under 63 at the venue.         
	Among other Indians in the fray, Jyoti Randhawa (273) carded 71 for his share of the sixth place, while Gaurav Ghei (280) signed off with 70 to be tied 37th.         
	Chowrasia (282) needed a solid round for a top 10 finish but the Calcutta pro stuttered to a final round of 74, his worst card of the week, to finish tied 46th.         
	Atwal, however, had no such worry. After rounds of 70, 68 and 68, he seemed to have reserved his best for the final day and the lone dropped shot on the third hole was the only blot in an otherwise perfect card of the Indian who hardly put a foot wrong on Sunday.         
	Atwal got off to a birdie-birdie start and though the third hole bogey snapped the streak, he looked irresistible.         
	A spectacular birdie binge  he blasted nine of them in his round  catapulted Atwal to the top of the leaderboard and the lightning and storm that hit the Kota Permai Golf and Country Club resulting in a two-and-half hours delay could not snap his rhythm.         
	It is an amazing feeling, a beaming Atwal said after the round.         
	I dont know how to put it into words. To come here and win this title twice now is incredible. In the play-off I thought Peter was in trouble off the tee but he played an amazing recovery and that put the pressure on me, he said.         
	I didnt think I had a chance starting out and just relaxed from the first hole. It was only on the 11th that I felt I had a chance. It is incredible, he said.         
	Overnight leader Hedblom missed a chance to win outright when his birdie putt on the 18th hung on the lip. He settled for a one-under 71.         
	The Malaysian Open is co-sanctioned by the European Tour and the Asian Tour.         
	Both players struggled to par the first extra hole, the par-five 18th, after Atwal found sand with his second shot and Hedblom drove into the water.         
	It was a good defence, said Hedblom. You are never happy when you lose and I thought I had a good chance to win. I am proud of myself for the way I defended my title and the putts I holed coming in.         
	Briton Simon Dyson carded a three-under 69 on the final day to share third place with Australian Kane Webber (65) on 271, with Italian Francesco Molinari alone at 272 after his 65.         
	Ryder Cup player Darren Clarke, who moved into contention on Saturday with a 67, settled for joint 10th place with Swedens Johan Edfors after closing with two-under 70 for 274.

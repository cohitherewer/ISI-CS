The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New league format on agenda
                                                                                                                                                                                                     New league format on agenda
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CAB is toying with the idea of revamping the local league structure in an effort to improve the standard of the game. Newly-elected joint secretary Arun Mitra has chalked out a plan of action to bring about a change in the existing format.         
	According to the plan, the top-10 first division teams will play in a Super Division league, while the remaining 27 teams will fight it out in another league after being divided into three groups.         
	Teams finishing at the bottom will be relegated from the Super Division, while the top two teams from the other league will be promoted.         
	This is only a plan, Mitra said.

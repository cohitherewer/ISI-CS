The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev tied 23rd
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev tied 23rd
                      
	Augusta: Jeev Milkha Singh brought home a level-par 72 to be tied 23rd after the penultimate round in the Masters on Saturday. Jeev fired three birdies against an equal number of bogeys on a wet and chilly day at Augusta for a three-day total of one-over 217 to lie just outside the top-20.         
	With the top-16 finishers and ties guaranteed of a return trip to Augusta next year, the Indian is now hoping to finish with an under-par final round to ensure a return ticket to the first major of the year.         
	If I can shoot in the red tomorrow, I hope it gets me in the top-16. That would be great if I can do that, said Jeev, who remains on course to better his last years tied 37th finish.         
	Playing alongside reigning US Open champion Angel Cabrera, Jeev continued to show his liking for the demanding Augusta layout with another steady performance, outscoring his playing partner by one.         
	Jeev turned in 35 with birdies on the second and seventh holes, courtesy putts from eight and 20 feet respectively, against a dropped shot on the fourth. However, he was disappointed with bogeys on the 11th and 14th spoiling his card. Jeev also missed several birdie chances on the lightning quick greens.         
	It could have been a better round. I had a few birdie chances out there and let them go. I put myself in a good position after the 13th where I was one under. Then I hit a good drive on 14 and hit a bad iron shot. That bogey was not needed, he said.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: John Buchanan is hoping Shoaib Akhtars unavailability will not have much of an impact on Kolkata Knight Riders performance in the Indian Premier League.         
	I hope his unavailability doesnt make much of a difference I can only hope he will be available soon, Buchanan said on landing in the city late on Friday.         
	The former Australian coach arrived along with Ricky Ponting, Brendon McCullum and David Hussey (accompanied by his partner) by a Singapore Airlines flight.         
	Despite being visibly tired after the long journey, the players will participate in the teams first practice session at the Eden on Saturday afternoon. Buchanan said the first session would be more of an interaction with the other players.         
	A few hundreds were present at the airport to cheer the quartet almost around midnight. The players and the coach were mobbed by the waiting fans and media.         
	Buchanan also said he had already had a round of discussion with Ponting during the long flight.         
	Earlier in the evening, Tatenda Taibu arrived along with Murali Kartik, Aakash Chopra, Yashpal Singh and Iqbal Abdullah. Physical trainer Adrian le Roux and Johns son Michael, the sides strength trainer, are already in the city.         
	Knight Riders play the inaugural match of the tournament in Bangalore on April 18.

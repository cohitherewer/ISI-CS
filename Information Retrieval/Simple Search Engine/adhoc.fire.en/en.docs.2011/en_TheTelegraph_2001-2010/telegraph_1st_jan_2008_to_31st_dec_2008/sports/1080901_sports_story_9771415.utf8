The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi, Stosur out
                                                                                                                                                                                           Bhupathi, Stosur out
                      
	New York: Mahesh Bhupathi and his Australian partner Samantha Stosur lost the plot towards the end and crashed out of US Open mixed doubles event after a see-saw second round battle here.         
	The Indo-Australian pair began in the right earnest before finishing on the wrong side of the one-hour battle that saw Swede Robert Lindstedt and his Australian teammate Rennae Stubbs win it 2-6, 6-3, 12-10 in tie-breaker.         
	Things looked rosy for Bhupathi and Stosur who broke their opponents twice to bag the first set to take early advantage. The second set, however, witnessed a fightback by their opponents who saved a break point and converted another to draw parity and stay afloat.         
	In the super tie-break, the Indo-Australian pair went neck-and-neck before their opponents cut loose to run away with the match. (PTI)

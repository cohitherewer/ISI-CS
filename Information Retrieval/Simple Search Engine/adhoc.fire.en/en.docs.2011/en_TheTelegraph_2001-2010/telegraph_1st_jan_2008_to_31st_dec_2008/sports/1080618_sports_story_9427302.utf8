The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Luis Aragones to field reserves 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Luis Aragones to field reserves 
                      
	Innsbruck: Coach Luis Aragones will give Spains reserves a chance to prove themselves when the Euro 2008 quarter finalists face Greece in their final group D game on Wednesday.         
	Spain, who will meet group Cs runners-up in the last eight on Sunday, take on a Greece side already eliminated after the Euro 2004 winners suffered two consecutive defeats.         
	With first place guaranteed my initial thought is to change almost everyone and give some of the other players a chance to show they are ready, said Aragones as he prepared for the game in Salzburg.         
	Spain could face either of the 2006 World Cup finalists, Italy and France, or Romania, from group C on Sunday in Vienna.         
	Like Aragones, Greek coach Otto Rehhagel has said that he will field several second string players in the match, although his changes have been forced because of injury.

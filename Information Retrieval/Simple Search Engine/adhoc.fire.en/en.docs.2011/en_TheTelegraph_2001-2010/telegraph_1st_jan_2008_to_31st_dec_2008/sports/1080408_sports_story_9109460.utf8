                                        Pak U-19 players not disciplined: Manager  Karachi: Majority of the players who represented Pakistan in the ICC Youth World Cup last month in Malaysia have serious disciplinary problems and they need to be reformed first before considered as future prospects, team manager Abdul Raquib said in his report.  Raquib alleged that Ahmed Shahzad, one of the most promising players of the U-19 team, was more interested in chasing girls than playing cricket. The report also narrated that one of the players, on the return flight home from Malaysia, even asked for an alcohol drink.   Media norms  Mumbai: Contentious clauses in the media accreditation norms of the IPL will be revised and a new set of guidelines will be issued soon, IPL governing council chairman Lalit Modi said. ldquo;New media accreditation guidelines will be issued soon, rdquo; Modi said. The deadline for media accreditation which expires on Tuesday will be extended, Modi said.  ECB adamant  London: Giles Clarke, the ECB chairman, said Monday he couldn rsquo;t see the likes of Kevin Pietersen playing in the IPL and risk injury ahead of the next Ashes series. ldquo;For a centrally-contracted player, I can rsquo;t see the coach, Peter Moores, wishing to release them, rdquo; Clarke said. ldquo;The risks are very significant mdash; we will be about to play Australia. rdquo;  Willey upset  London: Former Test umpire Peter Willey believes it is a ldquo;waste of time rdquo; for officials to report players for bad behaviour in the international game because they do not face severe enough punishment from the ICC. Willey, who still umpires in English county cricket, said: ldquo;When I first started playing in the mid-60s you respected everything the umpire did. There was no arguing or dissent about being given out or not out. rdquo;  Kanpur Test  Kanpur: Sachin Tendulkar rsquo;s absence and the fear of unseasonal rain have left Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) officials worried, fearing a lukewarm response for the third and final India-South Africa Test match starting here on Friday. UPCA officials fear Tendulkar rsquo;s absence might take some sheen of the tie.   Razzaq hopeful  Karachi: Pakistan rsquo;s discarded and banned allrounder Abdul Razzaq has described the rebel ICL as a tournament in the top bracket and one that will become more popular. ldquo;My performances have shown the board and selectors didn rsquo;t do justice with me when they dropped me for the World Twenty20 last year, rdquo; the Hyderabad Heroes player said after returning to his hometown Lahore on Monday.

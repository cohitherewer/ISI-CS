	Colombo: Gautam Gambhir made up for his first-innings flop show with a strokeful 60 as the three-day match between India and Sri Lanka Board XI petered to a mundane draw at the Cricket Club ground here on Sunday.         
	After India declared their first innings at the overnight score of 196 for eight, the hosts scored 247 for six in 55 overs before asking Anil Kumble and his men to take strike again.         
	India lost Virender Sehwag (14) and Rahul Dravid (26) before reaching 129 for two in 31 overs as the match ended in a stalemate. Gambhir, who had scored just four in the first innings, was not out on a fluent 60 off 82 balls with the help of eight boundaries. Sourav Ganguly was unbeaten on 22 off 45 balls that included just one boundary as the left-hander decided to spend maximum time in the middle.         
	With Kumble deciding to give his bowlers a go at the Sri Lankans, Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma removed off-colour Upul Tharanga (5) and Mahela Udawatte (15) to reduce the hosts to 29 for two. Harbhajan Singh once again scalped a couple but Chamara Silva (59 not out) and Dammika Prasad (43 not out) put their foot down to ensure there was no batting collapse and set India a target of 276 runs.         
	India had a poor start as Sehwag returned after a run-a-ball 14 even though Gambhir was determined to make the best of the opportunity.         
	Dravid had lasted just 10 balls in the first innings and he had a prolonged 47-ball stay on Sunday. With Sachin Tendulkar hitting 69 in the first innings, the think-tank promoted Ganguly, who had a forgettable first innings.

	Hobart: An inspired India stormed into the tri-series finals, relying on a clinical display by their young pace battery to thrash Sri Lanka by seven wickets in a low-scoring game here on Tuesday. 
    
	Needing to win the last match, the Indians dominated the encounter with beanpole pacer Ishant Sharma (four for 41) and rookie mediumpacer Praveen Kumar (four for 31) bundling out the islanders for 179 in 47.1 overs. 
    
	The Indian batsmen then overhauled the target without fuss with 17.4 overs to spare in what turned out to be a one-sided contest at the Bellerive Oval. Sachin Tendulkar, who has not been in the best of touch, marked his return to form with a sizzling 54-ball 63. 
    
	Gautam Gambhir, who remained not out on 63 from 90 balls, held the innings together after Robin Uthappa, promoted as an opener, was out cheaply in the second over. 
    
	Gambhir also hit the winning runs off Muttiah Muralidharan, who was hammered for 54 runs in his 8.2 overs to trigger off wild celebrations in the Indian dressing room. 
    
	The emphatic win also gave India a bonus point, taking their tally to 17 points from eight matches. Australia, who have already qualified, have 26 points while Sri Lanka are at the bottom with six. The last match between Australia and Sri Lanka on Friday is now inconsequential. 
    
	Everything went right for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men; from winning the toss and putting the opposition to bat, dismissing them cheaply and then watch Sachin return to form. 
    
	Lanka started brightly at 72 for one in the 15th over before they lost six wickets for 21 runs. India lost Uthappa in the second over but a 102-run second-wicket stand between Tendulkar and Gambhir ensured a facile win. 
    
	Sachin was majestic with his square cuts. He negotiated Muralidharan majestically, pedal-sweeping and occasionally hitting him over the top. One such sweep raised his half-century from 44 balls with nine fours. The match by then was nearly over.

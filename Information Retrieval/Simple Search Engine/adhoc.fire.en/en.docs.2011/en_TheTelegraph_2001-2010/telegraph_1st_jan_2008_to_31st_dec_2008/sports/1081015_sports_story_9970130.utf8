The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis not feeble under pressure
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lewis not feeble under pressure
    - inexperience occasionally forces errors from the 23-year-old Briton             KEVIN GARSIDE            Lewis Hamilton                                 
	Lewis Hamilton is useless under pressure, they say. It is the same drivel that used to echo around Michael Schumacher every time he made a mistake. The seven-time world champion goes to pieces under the cosh. Explain. Sounds like a GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) question to me. Not something to be taken seriously by grown men.         
	Hamilton has been under pressure since Ron Dennis threw him the keys to a McLaren as a 21-year-old, days after winning the GP2 championship in Monza. He entered the Melbourne paddock as the best-prepared rookie in history and Formula Ones first Afro-Caribbean driver. No special interest there then. No pressure at all.         
	His teammate last year was a double world champion. Four races into Hamiltons debut season Fernando Alonso was the one trailing in the championship. Which driver was feeling the pressure, do you presume? Yes, but Hamilton was McLarens pet, so the argument goes, the team favoured him. So much so, in fact, that in the fifth race in Monaco, the team ordered Hamilton not to attack to allow Alonso to win the race unfettered. Odd how favouritism works at McLaren.         
	At the next race in Canada, Hamilton took his maiden victory in a race that started four times. If Hamilton was feeble under pressure he could not have dealt with three safety car interventions or picked his way through the wreckage with cars bouncing off walls in all directions.         
	Yes he makes mistakes. So did Schumacher. Hamilton is only 23 years old. It is inexperience that on occasion forces errors, not weakness under pressure. In 2003 Schumacher pitched up in Imola on the back of his worst start to a season at Ferrari. The pressure to conjure some magic on Ferrari turf an hours drive from head office in Maranello was immense.         
	Schumachers mother was gravely ill. Shortly before qualifying he was told she would probably not survive the night. He stuck the Ferrari on pole. The Scuderias motorhome was surrounded by photographers desperate for the picture. Schumacher had slipped out the back of the circuit for one final audience with his mother in Germany.         
	She died overnight. Pressure augmented by grief. How did Schumacher respond? He won. Thats what champions do. Theory has it that Hamilton is about to reprise the errors of last year when the action resumes in China on Sunday. What errors would they be?         
	Hamilton did not fold under pressure in Shanghai. He was ordered to remain out on the circuit for six laps while losing time to Kimi Raikkonen on shredded tyres. On one lap five seconds drained away. The decision remains inexplicable in Formula One terms.         
	Hamiltons lead is five points. The title race is drum tight. The errors committed by Hamilton and Felipe Massa in Japan have even let Robert Kubica back into the championship equation. There are those who argue that Kubica is probably a better driver than Massa or Hamilton, makes fewer mistakes and is cooler under pressure.         
	The championship is Hamiltons to lose. Japan was not his best work. China offers another opportunity to demonstrate that he is champion material as well as a brilliant driver.         
	If he falls at the final hurdle again it will not be pressure that brings him down. He could not have travelled this far were he frail between the ears.

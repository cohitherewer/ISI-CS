The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Luis: We can win World Cup
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Luis: We can win World Cup
                      
	Vienna: Spain coach Luis Aragones said their 1-0 victory over Germany in Sundays Euro 2008 final was just the beginning for a talented young side which he believed could win the World Cup.         
	Aragones, speaking after his last match in charge of the national team, told a news conference: Lots of people have looked at this Spain as a model of how football should be played.         
	I have often thought that if I could manage this team relatively well then we would be champions, because we have got so many quality players. I think this team can continue along this path and win more titles.         
	We have players that are some of the best ball players and passers in the world... The players have matured since we went out of the World Cup and we have constructed a group that can win the European Championship and is capable of winning the World Cup.         
	Aragones, who will turn 70 in July and was the oldest coach at Euro 2008, has made it clear he will step down after the tournament. He is expected to take up a lucrative offer from Turkish club Fenerbahce to coach the team for the next two seasons.         
	Spains only previous title at senior level came on home soil when they beat the Soviet Union 2-1 in the final of the European Championship at Santiago Bernabeu in 1964. They reached another final of the European Championship 20 years later, but lost to France.

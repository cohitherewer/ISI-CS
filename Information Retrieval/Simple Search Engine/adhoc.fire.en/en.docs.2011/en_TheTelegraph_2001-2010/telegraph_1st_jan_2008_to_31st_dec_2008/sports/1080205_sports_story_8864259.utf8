                                                    Egg-throwing not a big deal: Mahela

      A CORRESPONDENT
      Mahela Jayawardene 
             
	Brisbane: Mahela Jayawardene is hoping to put up a better show in the tri-series two months after being hammered 2-0 by Australia in Tests. At a press conference on Monday, the Sri Lanka captain also downplayed the egg-throwing incident on Muttiah Muralidharan. 
    
	[Murali also laughed it off. When you come to Australia, you expect such incidents, said the off-spinner.] 
    
	Jayawardene echoed similar sentiments. Its not a big deal, we came here to play cricket and are looking forward to that. We just have to move on and not get too worried about such things, he said. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
        
	On Sri Lankas chances 
    
	Its all about preparation One-day cricket is totally different from Test matches. Its going to be an interesting series. India have done well in the recent past with a young team and Australia are always very consistent. Most teams are trying to set themselves up for the next World Cup by bringing in new players and seeing if they fit into the set-up. 
    
	On his thoughts about the tri-series 
    
	Every game, every point and every bonus point becomes very important in a tri-series. Its very important to get off to a good start. In a tournament like this, the first goal of every team is to get into the finals. Australia start favourites, but that doesnt mean you cant knock them out of the competition if you play consistently good cricket. 
    
	On the Indian youngsters 
    
	We have played against quite a few, only Manoj Tiwary and Rohit Sharma are the guys we havent come up against. But we saw Rohit at the Twenty20 World Cup. We therefore have a pretty good idea about them. India are a young side, but they have got the experience as well. I would be able to comment on the Indians after four or five matches. Ishant Sharma, for example, looks interesting. But once the international batsmen know about you, how you move on from there is important 
    
	On whether Sri Lanka have an edge over India 
    
	Its too early to talk about it. We need to start playing first, take one game at a time. It all depends on your form, and how you adapt to conditions and situations. 
    
	On why India were more successful against the Aussies in Tests 
    
	It was because their medium-pacers bowled better than we did. We did not bowl well and our batting was not up to the mark. It hampered Murali, besides the fact that they had four left-handers in their line-up. 
    
	On Sanath Jayasuriyas fitness (the left-handed opener was struck on the jaw during a practice game in Hobart on Friday) 
    
	He is fine. It was just a cut, he needed a couple of stitches. Its nothing serious, hes fine and should play tomorrow. 
    
	On his message to teammates in the light of Harbhajan Singh being accused of racial abuse by Andrew Symonds 
    
	I have told the guys to concentrate on cricket, as simple as that. It was the advice I got as a youngster, and its the same advice I am giving the youngsters. Its a good lesson for all of us. These kind of things will crop up in future as well, but hopefully not too much. We shouldnt dwell on it too much, but move forward and concentrate on playing good cricket. India showed that they are a tough side, they blocked everything else out and played excellent cricket after the first two Tests. They showed a lot of character, and that is the way forward for all teams. 
    
	On Muralidharan and the egg-throwing incident 
    
	Its just a random thing... They were all having a good laugh. We just needed to make a report at the police station to ensure it does not escalate and nothing serious happens eggs are fine. Murali was part of a big group going out for dinner and was the only recognisable person in that lot. Its not a big deal, we came here to play cricket and are looking forward to that. We just have to move on and not get too worried about such things. All the guys were saying we wish it was Murali who got the egg and not one of our selectors. Its nothing serious, those guys were probably drunk. 
    
	On Muralis reaction 
    
	Murali was laughing about it as well. I think if he had a stone or something around him he would have thrown it back at the guy, that was the fun part of it. We asked him if he did get a chance and he said he was not sure what had happened And by the time they realised it was an egg the car had sped off. There were actually traffic lights in front, and he said luckily for them it was green as well Else we would have chased them down, thats Murali for you. The guy has gone through tougher things than eggs its not a big deal. 
    
	On the crowd in Australia 
    
	Australia is a place where you are not just against the aggression of players but the crowd as well. Everyone wants to win here. When teams come here they have to prepare for that and be much more tougher. You just have to block everything else and concentrate on your work in the middle. Thats the only way you can challenge these guys. Indians have showed that. After all the mishaps they got together and won the Test match to show character. Thats the way forward.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India desperate to keep slate clean 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Team India desperate to keep slate clean 
  - Its about going out and playing your best: Dhoni             Dhoni                           
	Dhaka: Going by current form, Bangladesh would need a miracle to pull the rug from under Indias feet in the cricket tri-series but Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his teammates sound cautious enough not to step on the banana skin on Thursday against the hosts.         
	Thursdays tie pits tournament favourites India against the lonely hosts, who are almost on their way out after Pakistan spanked them by 70 runs in the tri-series opener. In contrast, India look every inch the tournament favourite after Dhoni and his team thumped Pakistan by 140 runs to snap their 12-match winning spree on Tuesday night.         
	Indicating that the team would not lower the guard even against the minnows, Dhoni said he wanted to keep the slate clean.         
	We got to win every match. In fact, it is not about winning and losing. It is all about going out there and playing to your potential and strength, Dhoni said.         
	Everybody wants to win. It was a good game of cricket against Pakistan on Tuesday. Hopefully rain will not interfere tomorrow (Thursday), Dhoni said, almost indicating that only divine intervention can help the hosts on Thursday.         
	Refusing to under-estimating Bangladesh, Dhoni said the hosts were no push-overs.         
	They have enough depth in both batting and bowling and they should not be rated by one innings when they lost to Pakistan, he said.         
	Dhoni said though he had an eye on the job at hand, he was not missing the larger picture either.         
	We always look at the present. We are looking to win over Bangladesh and then go in to the final where we want to play to our potential. Then think about Asia cup, our next tournament and set a plan in place for positive result, he opined.         
	Bangladesh batting order has an obvious brittle look to it even though their bowlers did their best against Pakistan and managed to shoot out Shoaib Maliks team inside 40 overs.         
	In contrast, India look solid in all three aspects of the game. The star-studded batting line-up looks rock solid and it took them half centuries from just three batsmen to post a mammoth total of 330 for eight against Pakistan.         
	Teams

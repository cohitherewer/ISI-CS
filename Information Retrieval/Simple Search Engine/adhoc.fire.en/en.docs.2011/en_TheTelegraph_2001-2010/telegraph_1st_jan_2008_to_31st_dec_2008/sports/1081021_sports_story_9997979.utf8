                                                                                                                                                                                             Dempo to go all out   for win
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Colaco                                 
	New Delhi: A win away from being the first Indian team to qualify for the final of the AFC Cup, Dempo Sports Club are likely to go all out when they take on Lebanons Al Safa Club in the second leg semi-final in Hyderabad on Tuesday.         
	The Lebanese side hold an advantage as they were able to pip the Goan team by a last-minute goal in the first leg match in Beirut.         
	While Dempo need to win by more than one goal, Safa would be happy to settle for a draw.         
	Unlike the tie in Beirut, where Dempo played a defensive game, the Goan team will do everything to win the home match at the Gachibowli Stadium.         
	So much so, that Dempo coach Armando Colaco is likely to play his Brazilian midfielder Roberto Mendes da Silva or Beto, who has not yet fully recovered from the shoulder injury he received a few days ago.         
	Dempo will be without their key midfielder Clifford Miranda, who has a double booking against his name.         
	A similar offence will also keep top Safa midfielder Amer Khan out of the match. Colaco said that Tuesdays match should be the match of their lives for the Dempo players.         
	My boys are prepared for it. They played wonderfully throughout the tournament and it would be no different on Tuesday.

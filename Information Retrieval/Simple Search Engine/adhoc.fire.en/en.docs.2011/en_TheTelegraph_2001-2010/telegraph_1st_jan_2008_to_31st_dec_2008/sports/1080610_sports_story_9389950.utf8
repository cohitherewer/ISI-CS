                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bhupathi slips four spots
                  Leander Paes moves up a spot                     
	New Delhi: The shocking first-round exit from the French open last week has left Mahesh Bhupathi down four rungs at 13th in the latest ATP doubles rankings issued on Monday.         
	Bhupathi, who struggled with a calf injury at Roland Garros which forced him to pull out of the mixed doubles semi-finals, has 2785 points.         
	On the other hand, Leander Paes, who made a third-round exit in the doubles event of the clay court Grand Slam, moved up one spot to 23rd with 1995 points.         
	The warring duo agreed to pair for the quadrennial extravaganza only after a round of peace talks brokered by the All India Tennis Association during the French Open.

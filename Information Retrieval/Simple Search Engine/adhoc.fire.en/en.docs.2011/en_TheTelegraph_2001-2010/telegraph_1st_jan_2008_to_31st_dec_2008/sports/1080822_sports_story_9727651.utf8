	Beijing: Veronica Campbell-Brown scorched to victory in the Olympic 200 metres final on Thursday to retain her title and complete a Jamaican sweep of all four individual sprint gold medals at the Games.         
	The 26-year-old exploded out of the blocks, increased her lead around the bend and clocked a career-best 21.74 seconds to beat American Allyson Felix into second place for the second successive Olympics.         
	The world 100m champion, who was denied the chance of a sprint double in Beijing when she failed to make the Jamaican team for the shorter sprint, raced home a metre clear and raised her arms into the damp night air in celebration.         
	Indeed, Im very happy. Its great to come out and defend my title, she told reporters, adding that the Jamaican title sweep was also great. Fear is not something I bring to the track.         
	Felix, who has won the world title twice since the Athens Olympics four years ago, held off another Jamaican, Kerron Stewart, with a late surge to win silver in 21.93.         
	Deja vu. Not in a good way, she said. The start was terrible, the end was not that great. I still feel blessed. I feel ungrateful to say I was disappointed with this medal when so many people dont have the opportunity.         
	Weve shown again that Jamaica is the sprinting country, said Stewart.         
	We had and we have so many sprinters in Jamaica, its crazy. Were taking over every event bit by bit. (Agencies)

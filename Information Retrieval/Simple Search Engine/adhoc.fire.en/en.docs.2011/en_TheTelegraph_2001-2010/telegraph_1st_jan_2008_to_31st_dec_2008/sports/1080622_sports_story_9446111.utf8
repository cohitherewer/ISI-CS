The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asia Cup is a trial for Pakistan
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Asia Cup is a trial for Pakistan
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The Pakistan government has promised foolproof security during the Asia Cup which gets under way in Lahore and Karachi on Tuesday.         
	In fact, according to The Telegraphs sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), the June 24-July 6 tournament will actually be a trial for the security thats to be in place for the September 11-28 Champions Trophy.         
	Never before has the PCB hosted either the Asia Cup or the Champions Trophy. All the more reason, then, that nothing is found out of place.         
	Not entirely unexpectedly, though, cricketers from Australia, England and New Zealand have already expressed reservations and it wont surprise if misgivings (genuine or imagined) over security leads to some of the biggest names making themselves unavailable.         
	That would be disastrous at a time the 50-over game is under threat from the much livelier Twenty20 format.         
	Theres plenty at stake for Pakistan in the Asia Cup, definitely more so off the field Its obvious that the security arrangements during the tournament will be keenly watched and thats the reason the Asia Cup is a trial for all concerned in Pakistan, remarked a top ACC official.         
	The ACC-run tournament features six teams, including India.         
	Incidentally, ever since the Revival Series in 2004, Team India have been getting security on the lines of whats offered to a head of state.         
	This time, the Indians will be based in Karachi, which is prone to bouts of violence without too much provocation.         
	Meanwhile, the selection committee (comprising, among others, the chief executives or those holding an equivalent position in the Big Four boards) for the first-ever ACC awards meets in Dubai on July 1.         
	The awards will be presented on July 5 at a function, in Karachi, to mark the ACCs silver jubilee.

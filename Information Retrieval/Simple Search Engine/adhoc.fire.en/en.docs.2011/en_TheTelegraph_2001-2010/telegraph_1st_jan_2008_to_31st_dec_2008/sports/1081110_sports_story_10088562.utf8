The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav truly theDada of Indian cricket: Sunny
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sourav truly the Dada of Indian cricket: Sunny
    - Praise from the iconic former India captain             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE            Sunil Gavaskar                                 
	Nagpur: On Sunday evening, Little Master I Sunil Gavaskar spoke to The Telegraph, exclusively on Sourav Ganguly.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether he felt sad when Sourav went for a duck in his last innings for India         
	I did, yes... Nobody likes to see somebody failing to score in his final Test innings, but such things happen... If I may add, batsmen have the desire to score at least one, both in their first and last appearances... Of course, Sir Don too got out without scoring in his final innings... One felt more sad for Sourav as hed missed a hundred in the first innings.         
	The farewell Test getting dampened         
	People should remember Souravs 85 in the first innings, not the duck... Its a one-ball game and, as Ive said, these things happen.         
	Souravs career         
	Its a career which gave India so much joy... To talk of his batting, hed be one of the best sights when in flow... Nobody drove through the off-side like he did and well also miss his dancing down the wicket to the spinners. I particularly liked his cover drives... Liked his determination to overcome obstacles... Hed hang in there.         
	Sourav as captain         
	There was turmoil in Indian cricket soon after Sourav got the captaincy (March 2000, just before the match-fixing scandal) and he was able to straightaway make an impact... Its because of those early wins under him that a lot of the fans whod been disillusioned, came back to cricket. As captain, Sourav gave India plenty of pride and lots of substance... He provided the kind of leadership you seldom see in any walk of life.         
	Best way to sum up Sourav         
	Feisty and elegant... Somebody with an attacking sense, both as a batsman and captain.         
	Souravs legacy         
	If Im to talk of his captaincy, he made the team believe in itself... Believe that it could win.         
	What would he tell Sourav on Monday, his final day as an India cricketer         
	(Grins) Well played, youve had a terrific career and youve truly been the Dada of Indian cricket.         
	Finally, whether Sourav wouldve been tempted to take back his retirement and whether the selectors couldve asked him to reconsider his decision         
	Look, except for Bengali sweets and biryani, I dont know what else tempts Sourav! As for the selectors, once a player has announced hes quitting, then how can they talk to him? Its for the player alone to speak to them if hes having second thoughts.

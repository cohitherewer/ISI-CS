                                                   Fisichella will be the driving force

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Mumbai: Vijay Mallya on Thursday announced an international line-up of drivers for his Force India Formula One Team. 
    
	Force India will line-up Formula One veteran Giancarlo Fisichella of Italy and German Adrian Sutil, who was runner-up to Lewis Hamilton in the 2005 F3 Euroseries, as drivers for the 2008 championship season. Vitantonio Liuzzi, a Karting world champion, and FIA Formula 3000 champion, will be the test and reserve driver. 
    
	The drivers walked out of a racing helmet at the unveiling in a city hotel here. Mallya said he was proud of the fact that India would have a team in the F1 racing championship when it was thought that motor sport was expensive for a developing country. 
    
	I dont promise any miracles in 2008. My target is to have the Force India F1 team rightfully occupy a place on the podium at the Indian Grand Prix in 2010. 
    
	Asked why he had not selected Indian drivers like Narain Karthikeyan and Karun Chandok to race for Force India, Mallya said: It is not appropriate to put someone in the F1 cockpit and expect a result. I know Narain. He has won his race in the A1 GP (in China) and thats a long way off from the kind of performance expected in F1. Karun is like my son, and he told me he needs another year in GP2 before hes ready. 
    
	Fisichella, who turns 35 on Monday, has 12 years of experience in Formula One with teams like Jordan, Minardi, Benetton, Sauber and Renault. Sutil is an up and coming talent who collected his first championship point at the Japanese GP last year. 
    
	Mallya, who bought the Spyker-Ferrari F1 team for euro 88 million in October 2007 and renamed it Force India F1 with an Indian flag woven into the logo, said he had increased the budget for the team from $70 million in 2007 to $120 million, and set up three wind tunnels to strengthen the aerodynamics for the car, which has a Ferrari engine.

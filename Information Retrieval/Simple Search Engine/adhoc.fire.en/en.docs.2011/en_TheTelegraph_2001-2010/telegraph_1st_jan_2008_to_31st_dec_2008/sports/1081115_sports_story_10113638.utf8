The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer knocked out by Murray
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Federer knocked out by Murray
                      
	Shanghai: Roger Federer failed to reach the semi-finals of the Masters Cup for the first time after losing an extraordinary final group match 4-6, 7-6, 7-5 to Briton Andy Murray on Friday.         
	The 27-year-old Swiss, who was chasing a record-equalling fifth title, needed to win his final round robin match to progress to the knockout stage but succumbed to the Scots eighth match point after an enthralling three-hour contest.         
	I dont quit once I step on court, said Federer, who had a stomach bug earlier this week and treatment to his back before the deciding set.         
	My body was hurting, normally the best of three sets is peanuts and its a shame I couldnt handle it today.         
	Murray, the only unbeaten player in the $4.45 million event, had already qualified for the last four and will meet Russian Nikolay Davydenko on Saturday for a place in the final.         
	Im going to be a bit tired tomorrow but a win over Roger Federer means almost as much as winning the Masters Cup to me, Murray.         
	Frances Gilles Simon earlier beat Czech Radek Stepanek 6-1, 6-4 but faced an anxious wait before being confirmed as the fourth semi-finallist. The world No. 9 will play Serbias Novak Djokovic.         
	The 23-year-old, who won his ticket to the season finale when world No. 1 Rafael Nadal withdrew injured, finished with a 2-1 record in the round robin but his fate hung on the outcome of Federers match against Murray.         
	Simon is the first Frenchman in the knockout stage since Sebastien Grosjean in 2001.         
	Czech world No. 27 Stepanek came in at the last moment as a replacement for injured American Andy Roddick on Wednesday and, with nothing to play for, struggled to contain the dynamic young Frenchman.         
	Simon claimed the first set when the Czech netted after just 25 minutes and encountered only marginally more resistance in the second.         
	In doubles, Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy ended their campaign without winning a single set, after their third successive defeat on Friday.         
	The third seeded Indo-Czech pair lost their last round robin match of the Gold group 1-6, 4-6 to second seeds Daniel Nestor of Canada and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia.         
	Paes and Dlouhy finished bottom of the group while Mahesh Bhupathi and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles finished third in the Red group.         
	Paes and Dlouhy squandered five chances to break their rivals while their opponents succeeded in breaking them twice in the first set and once in the second to register their third win in a row.         
	Jonas Bjorkman played his last match on Friday after he and teammate Kevin Ullyet lost in a tie-breaker to the Poles Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski. He and Zimbabwean Ullyet went down 2-6, 6-1, 6-10 to be eliminated from the tournament.         
	The 36-year-old Swede, who announced retirement plans at Wimbledon, said he would miss the camaraderie, even the trash talk, but not the travel.         
	I still think its great to end my career in the biggest event of the year, said Bjorkman, who won three straight Wimbledon doubles titles with Australias Todd Woodbridge and reached a singles ranking high of No. 4 in 1997.

	Calcutta: The CAB will have to organise a special anti-doping room for the forthcoming Indian Premier Leauge (IPL) Twenty20 matches at Eden Gardens. This is one of the few suggestions made by a two-member IMG inspection team that visited the venue on Saturday.         
	Following a two-hour inspection, the IMG duo of Catherine Simpson and Rob Hillman suggested that the stadium should have a separate anti-doping room equipped with a toilet and space for office work.         
	Having inspected the galleries, they also asked the CAB if a stand could be erected opposite the Dr B.C. Roy Club House with equal comfort level. They suggested that there should be a special TV control room. Seats also need to be repaired immediately.         
	CAB president Prasun Mukherjee, however, said a new club house couldnt be built because of logistical problems.         
	Special facilities, though, will be provided to the F block spectators, as had been done during the 1996 World Cup semi-final. They will get the complimentary refreshment packets from Khudiram Anushilan Kendra, Mukherjee said.         
	The CAB has been told that they would have to be content with 20 per cent of the tickets. The CAB had asked for 30,000 tickets.         
	IPL chairman Lalit Modi spoke to Mukherjee on Saturday. Admitting that there was no way they could demand more than 20 per cent of the tickets from Red Chillies Entertainment, Mukherjee said: I will request the members to agree on the 20 per cent issue so that we dont have to forego the matches. I hope the members will agree.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Foreign coaches plying their trade with different I-League clubs in India are likely to come under Asian Football Confederation (AFC) scanner for not possessing AFC A licence, according to AIFF sources.         
	It includes leading names like Moroccan Karim Bencherifa and Nigerian Clifford Chukwama, who have already established themselves as top club coaches in India. While Karim is set to take over Mohun Bagan after a highly successful season with Churchill Brothers, Chukuwama continues to be with Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	In a recent circular to clubs, AIFF said that only coaches having AFC A licence are eligible to coach I-League teams in both first and second division clubs. You are therefore advised to see that your club coach has A licence, the circular said. Please note that only those who have passed the B licence course can apply for A licence.         
	AIFF secretary, Alberto Colaco said that foreign coaches in other clubs would also come under this rule.         
	Currently, there are six foreign coaches employed with different club teams in the I-League. While Karim and Chukwama are the most high-profile ones, Emeka Ezeugo (Churchill Brothers), David Booth (Mumbai FC), Chima Okorie (New Delhi Heroes) and Barnard McNally (Pune FC) are the other overseas coaches.

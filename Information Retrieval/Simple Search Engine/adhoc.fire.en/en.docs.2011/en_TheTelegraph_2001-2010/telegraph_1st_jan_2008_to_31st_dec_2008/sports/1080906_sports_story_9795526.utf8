The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I overreacted to jokes: Djokovic
                                                                                                                                                                                                       I overreacted to jokes: Djokovic
                  Novak Djokovic                     
	New York: Novak Djokovic said he overreacted to jokes about his long list of injuries when he lashed out at Andy Roddick after defeating the American on Thursday to reach the semi-finals of the US Open.         
	He made a joke and it was a misunderstanding, the third-seeded Serb told reporters after he had cooled off, following an angry courtside outburst that brought boos from the crowd at the Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	Maybe I exaggerated and reacted bad in that moment. I apologise if I reacted like that. This was just impulsive.         
	Roddick had commented after his previous match on the assorted maladies cited by Djokovic, who complained about stomach, hip, ankle and breathing problems during his five-set win against Spains Tommy Robredo.         
	It was completely meant in jest, the 2003 Open winner said. Im sorry he took it that way. Theres nothing else to say. I dont think I was over the line. It wasnt my intention and Im sorry he felt that way.         
	Maybe I did him a favour tonight, Roddick added ruefully, suggesting he might have inadvertently fired up the Serb.         
	Djokovic would not detail his current physical condition but gave no signs of duress in dispatching Roddick.         
	Other players in the past, including Roger Federer during a Davis Cup rubber, have accused Djokovic of stretching the rules that allow players to receive multiple medical breaks provided it was a new problem that needed to be treated by the trainer.         
	Maybe people think that Im exaggerating with these things, Djokovic said, but I just want to make sure that everything is all right. Thats all.         
	It doesnt mean that if Im inviting a doctor to the court or a physiotherapist that Im dying.         
	Roddick suggested another underlying current to disquiet in the locker room with Djokovic having last year entertained fans at the National Tennis Center with on-court parodies of tennis luminaries including Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova.         
	I figure if youre going to joke and imitate other people and do the whole deal, then you should take it, Roddick said. (REUTERS)

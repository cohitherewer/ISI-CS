The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tania helps India hold Russia
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tania helps India hold Russia
                      
	Dresden: International Master Tania Sachdev guided India to a creditable draw against top seed Russia while her male compatriots thumped El Salvador to remain in joint lead after Round III of the Chess Olympiad.         
	The Indian mens resounding 3.5-0.5 win against El Salvador in the open section kept them in joint lead on six match points along with Russia, Armenia, Germany 1, Spain, Ukraine, Norway, England and Romania.         
	In the women category, Tania was a class act with white even though top rated Indian D. Harika and Nisha Mohota lost their games against world womens champion Alexandra Kosteniuk and Nadezhda Kosintseva, respectively.         
	On the fourth board the experience of Swati Ghate again came in handy defeating higher rated Ekaterina Korbut. The Indian women slipped a bit in the standings after getting one point against the Russians but this result might go a long way in the overall standings of a depleted side without top player Koneru Humpy.         
	Tania stole the thunder against Tatiana in a Nimzo Indian defence game. Capitalising on a tactical error, Tania won an exchange on the 28th move and wrapped the issue in 42 moves.         
	Hungary, Armenia, China, Serbia, Poland and Georgia share the lead with six points apiece in the womens section while Indian eves are now placed joint seventh.         
	In the biggest upset of the Olympiad thus far, 19th seed Norway defeated third seed China 2.5-1.5 in the open section. The remaining fancied teams, however, coasted to victories. Top seeded Russians dismissed Cuba 3.5-1.5 while second seed Ukraine held on to their own to beat Georgia by a 2.5-1.5 margin.

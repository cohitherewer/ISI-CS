            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengals (CAB) working committee will discuss coach Utpal Chatterjees comments on the selection of Sreevats Goswami for the Ranji Trophy quarter final tie against Tamil Nadu.               
	We will take up this issue at our next working committee meeting This is not the right time to discuss all this. The team is playing a crucial match and we should not do anything that can harm the tempo of the team, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Wednesday. The former left-arm spinner, however, left with the players for Bangalore on Wednesday.         
	The focus is on performance now This will be an important match for us and we need to stay focused, Utpal said at the airport. According to sources, Dalmiya had a closed door meeting with chairman of selection committee Sambaran Banerjee, who had refused to accompany the side following the controversy, on Wednesday.         
	Sambaran has agreed to leave for Bangalore tomorrow a CAB official said.

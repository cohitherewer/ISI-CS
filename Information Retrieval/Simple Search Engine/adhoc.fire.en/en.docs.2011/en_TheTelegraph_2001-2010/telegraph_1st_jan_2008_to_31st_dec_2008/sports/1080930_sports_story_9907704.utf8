	New Delhi: Mohun Bagan will have to do without their third foreigner, Brazilian Marcos Pereira, in their second I-League match as JCT are unlikely to release him within the next few days.         
	According to JCT sources, the Phagwara side will take a decision regarding their new Brazilian recruit Silva only after returning to Punjab.         
	JCT, currently in Goa, will play against Vasco on Thursday. Mohun Bagan take on Air India on Friday. JCT had said they would release Marcos if the performance of their new recruit satisfies them. This Brazilian seems to possess good skills but we should not rush to a conclusion, said JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh from Goa.

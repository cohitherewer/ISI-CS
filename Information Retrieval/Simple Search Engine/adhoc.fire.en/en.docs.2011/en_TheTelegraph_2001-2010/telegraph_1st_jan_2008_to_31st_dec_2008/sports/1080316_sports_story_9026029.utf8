The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bindra, Patel stay in contention 
                                                     Bindra, Patel stay in contention 
  - Former BCCI president sets pre-conditions for ICC chief executives post       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Inderjit Singh Bindra                                 
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) sub-committee, empowered to select the next chief executive, is understood to have recommended two names to the all-powerful executive board  Indias Inderjit Singh Bindra and South Africas Imtiaz Patel.         
	However, according to The Telegraphs sources, Bindra has placed certain pre-conditions and sought some clarifications.         
	Bindra couldnt be reached for a comment, but its quite possible that he has asked for more powers for the chief executive.         
	The sub-committee, which met in Dubai on Saturday, has referred the pre-conditions and clarifications to the executive board as that body alone can discuss such matters.         
	The board will be meeting, in Dubai itself, on Monday-Tuesday.         
	Bindra is a vastly experienced former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) head, while Patel is the SuperSport channels chief executive.         
	In the 1990s, Patel worked under the legendary Dr Ali Bacher, when he called the shots in the United Cricket Board of South Africa (now Cricket South Africa).         
	The other South African in contention, one-time chief selector Haroon Lorgat, didnt get the sub-committees endorsement.         
	That it would actually be a two-horse race was reported in these columns on Friday.         
	President Ray Mali, vice-president David Morgan, BCCI chief Sharad Pawar (who will head the ICC from 2010) and Cricket Australia chairman Creagh Connor are on the sub-committee, with Pakistans Dr Nasim Ashraf a special invitee.         
	So far, the ICCs chief executives have been from Australia  David Richards and the outgoing Malcolm Speed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Top order needs to fire, says Sourav
  - We won in the first 6-7 overs we bowled: Yuvraj       A STAFF REPORTER            Kings XI Punjabs Shaun Marsh en route to his 40 in Mohali on Saturday. Picture by Sanjay Kurl                                 
	Calcutta: As Kolkata Knight Riders crashed to their fourth successive defeat in the Indian Premier League, it was the 21 runs that Ishant Sharma conceded in the final over that made the difference. Captain Sourav Ganguly, however, felt the team could still bounce back.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Yuvraj Singh: I think we won the match in the first six/seven overs we bowled. Sreesanth showed more responsibility with the new ball and that made a big difference. His breakthroughs early in the innings helped us in keeping the momentum going. We were able to sustain the pressure         
	Sourav Ganguly: Things havent been falling into place for us for sometime now Weve been losing wickets in clusters. Were disappointed about the 21 runs Ishant (Sharma) conceded in the final over. But hes a young man and will learn with experience. I still thought that the target was achievable Well think about promoting Hussey to No.4 Right now our top order needs to fire and that is important. We can still bounce back Everyday is a new day. Its a matter of putting our heads down and starting afresh.         
	Irfan Pathan (MoM): The ball swung nicely and we made the most of the opportunities. Im pretty happy with myself. Overall, it was a good bowling performance. Im enjoying this After having missed 6/7 months of action with the national side, Im enjoying every bit of it. I keep coming back stronger.

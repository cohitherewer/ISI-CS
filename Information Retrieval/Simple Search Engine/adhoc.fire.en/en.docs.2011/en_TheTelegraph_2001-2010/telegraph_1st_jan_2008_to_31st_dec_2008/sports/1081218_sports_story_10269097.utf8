The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Churchill confident vs Dempo
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Churchill confident vs Dempo
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The battle for supremacy in Indian football has often come down to the battle between Calcutta and Goa. That is set to be the case once again in the 30th Federation Cup final on Sunday and Churchill Brothers will lock horns with Dempo Sports Club on Thursday to decide Goas flag-holder in the final.         
	Thanks to the schedule of the tournament, both Churchill and Dempo had ample rest before the semi-finals. Both teams are in good shape and raring to go.         
	Churchill coach Zoran Djordjevic, proud of his teams performance in the group stage, said on Wednesday, the eve of the match, that they deserve to win.         
	The way weve played so far. We deserve to win, he told reporters, also informing there are no injury worries for him.         
	Dempo coach Armando Colaco, on the other hand, said this match is about Junior, the forward who died during a Federation Cup match.         
	When its a Fed Cup match, we remember Junior. Ive told my boys to enjoy themselves and play their hearts out. Im not putting them under any kind of pressure, Colaco said.         
	Colaco has been saying right through the season that his priority is the AFC Cup and not the domestic tournaments. But after getting into the semi-finals, he would definitely be looking at the title.

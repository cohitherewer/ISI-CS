The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Daniel Chopras hopes fade
                                                   Daniel Chopras hopes fade
                      
	Los Angeles: Daniel Chopras hopes of making the cut were all but over before darkness suspended play early in the second round of the Northern Trust Open golf tournament.         
	The Swede of Indian origin is tied at 87th place after returning a three-over 74 in the second round on Friday. He has a total of five-over 147 and is, at the moment, two shots below the projected cut.         
	Among those also almost certain to miss out are American world No. 6 Jim Furyk, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, Britons Justin Rose and Lee Westwood and 2006 US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy of Australia.         
	Phil Mickelson took control by grabbing a four-shot lead. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia to review security situation before India tour
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Australia to review security situation before India tour
    - BCCI asserts Delhi blasts will have no bearing on the upcoming series                 Ricky Ponting                           
	Melbourne: The bomb blasts in Delhi cast a shadow on the upcoming tour to India with Cricket Australia (CA) saying it will review the security situation before proceeding with the four-match Test series.         
	The board would seek advice from the Australian Government and ask team security manager Reg Dickason for an urgent report on the security situation in India, CA Public Affairs Manager Peter Young said in a statement on Sunday.         
	Dickason will work with the Australian Cricketers Association and CA general manager of cricket Michael Brown who has been assigned the job to speak to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the Australian High Commission in New Delhi and security agencies to gain information on travelling in India.         
	We will seek advice from the Australian Government and our security expert Dickason has been asked to compile a report. Cricket general manager Brown will speak to the BCCI and High Commission in New Delhi, Young said.         
	Based on this report and other inputs, we will take a decision on the tour next week or so, he said.         
	The fundamental principle that always comes first is the safety of the team and the team officials.         
	Young said a pre-tour assessment has already been done but if the concerns remain Cricket Australia will consider another inspection.         
	The BCCI, however, asserted that the serial blasts in Delhi will have no bearing on the upcoming Test tour by Australia and it would go ahead as scheduled.         
	BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said there was no threat to the tour.         
	I have not heard about any communication from Australia and I dont think there will be any change to the tour schedule, Shah said.         
	I hope Australia also understands our position. The situation is normal and the Australian tour to India will go as per schedule, he said. On CAs plan to send a security team to India, Shah said: If there are any concerns, a security team will come. I dont think there will be any problem in Australia coming to India.         
	Meanwhile, latest Australian governments travel advice for India is to exercise a high degree of caution because of high risk of terrorist activity by militant groups.         
	A 15-man Australian squad will leave for India on September 21 with the first Test starting in Bangalore on October 9. New Delhi is the venue of the third Test starting on October 29.

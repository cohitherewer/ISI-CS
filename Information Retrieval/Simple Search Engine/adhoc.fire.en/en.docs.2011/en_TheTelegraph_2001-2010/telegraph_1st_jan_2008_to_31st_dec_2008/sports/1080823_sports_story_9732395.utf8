	Beijing: Indias best-ever Olympic campaign, which yielded an unprecedented three individual medals, did not get a befitting signing-off as the womens 4x400m team wilted in the heats at the picturesque Birds Nest stadium on Friday.         
	A botched up start never allowed India to really push for a place in the final and the collective effort by S. Geetha, Manjeet Kaur, Chitra Soman and Mandeep Kaur  a below-par of 3:28.83  was good enough to finish seventh in the eight-team heat one.         
	Manager Kirpal Singh said the girls tried their best and he could not blame them. (PTI)

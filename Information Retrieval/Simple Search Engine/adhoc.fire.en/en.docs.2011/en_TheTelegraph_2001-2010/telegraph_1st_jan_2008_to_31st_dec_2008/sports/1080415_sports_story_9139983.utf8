The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | South Africa trio wont miss action
                                                                                                                                                                                                     South Africa trio wont miss action
                      
	Durban/Chennai: South African stars Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher and Ashwell Prince will stay back to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) from the initial stage. The three failed to make it to the Cape Cobras squad for the domestic pro20 semi-finals.         
	Captain Graeme Smith, however, figured among the squad announced on Monday and he would miss IPL action for the Rajasthan Royals till his domestic commitments are over. Six South Africans in the Test squad for the just concluded series against India  Smith, J.P. Duminy, Kallis, Boucher, Prince and Monde Zondeki  were available for selection but the Cobras decided to include only Smith and Duminy.         
	Meanwhile, Chennai Super Kings on Monday said the absence of South African cricketers Makhaya Ntini and Albie Morkel in their first few IPL fixtures will not affect team balance.         
	Ntini and Morkel will miss at least the first three games since the IPL dates clash with the domestic pro 20 tournament. We have good back up with Jacob Oram, Laxmipathy Balaji and Manpreet Goni besides P. Amarnath, head of cricketing matters V.B. Chandrasekhar said after the teams 15-over-a-side practice tie here ahead of their first match against Kings XI Punjab in Mohali on April 19.         
	The former Test player said captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is likely to join the team in Mohali.         
	In a related incident, former Pakistan bowling great Wasim Akram warned on Monday that the IPL could seriously damage international cricket if the games governing body fails to intervene, adds another report from Lahore.         
	I fear the IPL can be a serious distraction and can cause mayhem if the ICC doesnt intervene because it involves huge money and players are ready to abandon international cricket, Akram said.         
	The ICC should have foreseen the danger 10 years ago because it and other cricket boards earn billions of dollars with players getting a small percentage, so such a thing was bound to happen, Akram said.         
	Akram said he hoped new ICC chief Haroon Lorgat, who will replace Malcolm Speed in June, would tackle the problem.         
	Test cricket will stay as it is but I think the ICC will have to find some ways to keep the 50-over interest alive, said Akram who holds the world record of most one-day wickets with 502.

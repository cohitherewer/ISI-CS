	Bangalore: A typical Virender Sehwag (47) blistering knock and his 90-run first wicket stand with Gautam Gambhir (39) helped Delhi DareDevils survived a middle-order collapse to coast to a five-wicket win over Bangalore Royal Challengers in an Indian Premier League (IPL) tie here on Monday.         
	Chasing 155 for a crucial victory, the DareDevils rode on Sehwag and Gambhirs rollicking start to reach 158 for five with 10 balls to spare to notch up their sixth win from 12 matches which kept them in the reckoning for a semi-final berth.         
	Earlier, the Bangalore Royal Challengers posted 154 for seven, raised mainly on Sreevats Goswamis debut half century (52) and Misbah-ul-Haqs (47) late charge.         
	Goswamis 52 came off 42 deliveries.           (PTI)

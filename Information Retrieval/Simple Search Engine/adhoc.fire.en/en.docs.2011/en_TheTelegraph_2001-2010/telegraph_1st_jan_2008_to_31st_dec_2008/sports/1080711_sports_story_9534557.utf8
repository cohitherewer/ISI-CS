The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith embarks on diplomacy course
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Smith embarks on diplomacy course
  - Im sure Pietersen is going to be hugely motivated to do well: South Africa captain       Simon Briggs            Graeme Smith                                 
	Graeme Smith has clearly been on a diplomacy course since his bumptious arrival as Test crickets youngest captain. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he even resisted the urge to barrack Kevin Pietersen.         
	The Smith and Pietersen show has become one of sports most acrimonious soap operas since they first met in the winter of 2004-05. It started when Pietersen took a slating, both on and off the field, for lacking loyalty to South Africa, the country of his birth. When Pietersens autobiography was published, two years later, he responded by calling Smith an absolute muppet.         
	But this summers South Africans are determined not to let the issue become a distraction and they have maintained a policy of tactful no comment. The only vaguely inflammatory remarks to appear were published in a magazine.         
	Kevin and I would get on a lot better if he kept his mouth shut, said Smith, in an interview.         
	At Lords on Wednesday, Smith took a more guarded tone. I havent seen him yet, he replied when asked about his old adversary.         
	Im sure [Pietersen] is going to be hugely motivated to do well and he will feel a touch of pressure also. He has put himself in the frontline all the time, both in the way he has gone about things in the media and on the field.         
	When it comes to feuds, Smiths track record is up there in the Sir Alex Ferguson class. His first appearance in the worlds headlines came when he blew the whistle on Matthew Haydens foul-mouthed sledging  so breaking the unwritten law that What goes on the field, stays on the field.         
	Since then, he has irritated Michael Vaughan by calling him queer, and also fell out with Shane Warne  although that wound healed when Warne and Smith combined to claim the Indian Premier League title.         
	I think Ive settled into who Graeme Smith is, he said on Wednesday, lapsing into the third person so beloved by cricket captains across the world.         
	Ive settled down, become a lot calmer  now I think before becoming involved in something.         
	Everyones always questioning whether youre good enough, whether its the media, the public or the opposition team trying to put you under pressure.         
	I had to be single-minded to handle the job at 22, but since then Ive had to repair a few relationships that have been roughed up over the years.         
	Older, wiser and definitely bulkier, Smith still represents the biggest wicket in the South African top order. Last time he played a Test series in 2003 at Lords, he faced a moment of gamesmanship from Nasser Hussain  then Englands captain, who referred to him as wotsisname in a press conference, before introducing him to the match referee as Greg.         
	Smith responded with back-to-back double-hundreds, including a spectacular 259 at Lords. Perhaps a policy of tactfulness would be wise from England, too.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tanvir shines in triumph
                                                                                                                                                                                           Tanvir shines in triumph
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan made Hong Kong realise the gruels of top-level international cricket, handing them a crushing 155-run defeat in a Group B match of the Asia Cup at National Stadium here on Tuesday.         
	Electing to bat, Pakistan overcame early hiccups to post an imposing 288 for nine and then stopped Hong Kong at 133 for nine in 37.2 overs to make an easy start. The Hong Kong innings folded without losing all the wickets as Zain Abbas retired at the individual score of 26, which was also the highest for them.         
	Hong Kong, led by Tabarak Dar, did well in the first half of the match, stopping Pakistan from reaching 300 but scoring against an experienced attack was the real test of their batting line up.         
	Sohail Tanvir put up a brilliant all-round show in Pakistans victory as he first played a crucial 59-run knock and then picked up two wickets to pile on the agony for Hong Kong.           (PTI)

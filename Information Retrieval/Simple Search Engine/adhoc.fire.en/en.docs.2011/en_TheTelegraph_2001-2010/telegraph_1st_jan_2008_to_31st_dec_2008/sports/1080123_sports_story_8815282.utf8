                                                   Lawson: Too much cricket hurting us

           
	Karachi: Coach Geoff Lawson feels non-stop cricket in the last few months has robbed him of a chance to put in place plans to make Pakistan a consistent side. 
    
	Lawson said he needed to work on other aspects of cricket not related to actual playing, such as the mental side, which he felt could only be done away from actual action. 
    
	For four months it has been practice, play and travel. I think we only had two days off in that time. And one of those days was the day after the World Twenty20 final. When you are preparing for games all the time you are not working on things like changing of attitudes and it doesnt allow you to work on other sides of the game, Lawson told a cricket website. 
    
	I am trying to make Pakistan more consistent. We are not going to win every game but the reason why Australia play so well is that even if they are 4-0 up they are trying their hardest to make it 5-0. There is still a hunger to give their best, he said. 
    
	The former fast bowler said he faced no language or cultural difficulties in coaching the Pakistan team or living in the country. 
    
	There are many coaches in world football where their players speak all sorts of languages so Im fortunate in that at least my team speaks one language and most have a decent grasp of English. There are all kinds of ways to get the message across. (PTI)

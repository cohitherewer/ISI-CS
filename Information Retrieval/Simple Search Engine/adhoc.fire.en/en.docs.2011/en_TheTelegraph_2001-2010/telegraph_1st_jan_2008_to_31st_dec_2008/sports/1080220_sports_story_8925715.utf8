	Calcutta: For Hyderabad lad Vishnu Vardhan, the city is proving to be lucky.                     
	About two months after winning his first national (grass courts) title at the South Club, the 21-year-old eliminated Karan Rastogi, who is about 500 places above Vardhan in the ATP rankings.         
	The 1009-ranked Vardhan, who was given a wild card in the Coal India-ITF Mens Futures, ousted Rastogi 6-3, 6-1 to make the round of 16 at the Jaidip Mukerjea Tennis Academy on Tuesday. The Mumbaikar, incidentally, was top-ranked among the 14 Indians in the 32-member draw.         
	Breaking Rastogi in the first and third games, Vardhan made a rocking start to take a 3-0 lead. Rastogi came back briefly to make it 3-2 during which the senior pro broke Vardhan once in the fourth game. But that was it. Vardhan upped the ante as he broke Rastogi again in the ninth game to wrap up the first set in 43 minutes.         
	His powerful serves and chiselled groundwork helped him seal the second set even more easily. In 31 minutes, Vardhan showed Rastogi the exit door to mark his first win over the latter from four exchanges. However, in the match of the day, Tushar Liberhan gave Vaja Uzakov a tough fight before bowing out 6-2, 3-6, 6-4.         
	Vivek Shokeen won his match to make it four Indians in the pre-quarters. Ranjeet Murugesan and Rohan Gide advanced on Monday.

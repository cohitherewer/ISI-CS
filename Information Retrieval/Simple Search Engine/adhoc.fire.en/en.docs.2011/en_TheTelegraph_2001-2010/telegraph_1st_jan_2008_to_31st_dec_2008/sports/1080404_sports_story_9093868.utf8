The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kallis girlfriend feels for India
                                                   Kallis girlfriend feels for India
                                Shainone Jardim        
	Ahmedabad: Girl friend of South African cricket star Jacques Kallis Thursday said it was very sad to see Indian fans booing their own team, who were bundled out for a paltry 76 in the second Test.         
	It is very sad to see the Indians booing their own players, Shainone Jardim said, describing the behaviour as the only bad thing she noticed in India after her arrival.         
	Jardim was very happy that Kallis scored an unbeaten half-century during the Test. I am very proud of him.         
	Accompanying Jardim was Jeanne Kietzmann, an actress and girlfriend of Dale Steyn, whose five-wicket haul ripped through the Indian batting order.         
	Kietzmann too was happy with the way the South Africans played.         
	It was a fantastic bowling display by Steyn and superb innings by Kallis and A.B. de Villiers. Their innings have put the South Africans on top, she said.         
	Both Jardim and Kietzmann were seen cheering their team from the pavilion. Dressed in their teams T-shirts, they were the star attraction in the pavilion.           (PTI)

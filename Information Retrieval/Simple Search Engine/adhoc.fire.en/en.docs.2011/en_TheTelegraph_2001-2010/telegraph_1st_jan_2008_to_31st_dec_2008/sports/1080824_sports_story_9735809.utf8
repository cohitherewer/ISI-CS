	Calcutta: A senior national selector must either have represented India or played more than 25 first class matches, according to the new norms laid down by the BCCI working committee at its meeting in Mumbai on Saturday. While appointing a senior selector, it must also be ensured that he retired from the game at least ten years ago.         
	The selector will be paid an annual honorarium of Rs 25 lakh and he cannot be an office-bearer of the BCCI or any of its affiliated units, according to a release. The period after retiring from the game to become a junior selector or member of womens panel has been set at five years.         
	The selectors for the junior teams will get Rs 15 lakh annually while the selectors for the womens teams will get Rs 5 lakh. The other decisions at the working committee meeting include:         
	The BCCI decided to give shooter Abhinav BindraRs 25 lakh. Grappler Sushil Kumar and pugilist Vijender Kumar will get Rs 10 lakh each.         
	The BCCI, which has set up a National Sports Development Fund (NSDF) with a corpus of Rs 50 crore alongwith the sports ministry, will double its contribution to the fund from Rs 25 crore to Rs 50 crore for next three years.         
	A monthly gratis for women was approved by which those who had played 10 or more Tests would get Rs 15,000 per month and those who turned out in five to nine Tests would receive Rs 10,000.         
	The committee also decided to extend the monthly gratis scheme to the widows of Test umpires.         
	It was also decided to send a woman cricket coach to China.

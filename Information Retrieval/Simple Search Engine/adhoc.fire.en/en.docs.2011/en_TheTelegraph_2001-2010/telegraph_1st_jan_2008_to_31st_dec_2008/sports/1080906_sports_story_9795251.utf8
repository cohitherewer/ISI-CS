The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Keegan leaves behind   a mess
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Keegan leaves behind   a mess
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                            
	Kevin Keegan fired a bitter parting shot at Newcastle Uniteds directors Thursday night as he resigned from the managers post after claiming he had been driven out of the Tyneside club where sights are being set on making Tottenham assistant manager Gus Poyet his successor.         
	In an extraordinary announcement as his second spell as Newcastle boss come to an end after just 233 days in charge, Keegan launched a thinly disguised attack at club owner Mike Ashley, after losing an acrimonious St James Park power struggle with director of football Dennis Wise and his fellow board members.         
	As Keegan broke his silence, plans for a fans revolt were starting to gather momentum.

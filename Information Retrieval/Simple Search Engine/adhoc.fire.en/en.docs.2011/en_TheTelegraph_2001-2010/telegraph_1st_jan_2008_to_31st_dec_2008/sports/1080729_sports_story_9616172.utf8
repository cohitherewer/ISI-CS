	New Delhi: Sania Mirzas bad run on the tour took a heavy toll on her singles ranking as she dropped 15 places to plummet to 50 in the latest WTA list issued on Monday.         
	Sania made a comeback after recovering from a wrist injury but is still struggling to get back to winning mode crashing out of the first and second rounds at Stanford and Los Angeles respectively.         
	However, her doubles ranking got a boost as she gained six places from 26 to break into top-20 once again. Sania and American Bethanie Mattek made a semi-final appearance in the East West Bank Classic in Los Angeles.         
	She now has 633 points in singles and 1600 in doubles.         
	Meanwhile, doubles ace Mahesh Bhupathi entered the top-10 zone despite losing the quarter finals of the Rogers Masters Cup along with Mark Knowles to Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy.         
	Bhupathi gained two places to be at 10 while Paes remained static at 15.

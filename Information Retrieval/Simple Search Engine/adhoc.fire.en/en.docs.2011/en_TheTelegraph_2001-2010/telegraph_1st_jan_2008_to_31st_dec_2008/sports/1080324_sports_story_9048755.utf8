The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mardy catches big fish
                                                     Mardy catches big fish
          
	Indian Wells: World number one Roger Federer was stunned by unseeded American Mardy Fish after Rafael Nadals Pacific Life Open title defence came to an abrupt halt in Saturdays semi-finals.         
	Federer lost to an American player for the first time in 42 matches when he was crushed 3-6, 2-6 by Fish in a match lasting just over an hour at Indian Wells Tennis Garden.         
	Fish, who had never beaten Federer in five previous meetings, outplayed the Swiss on a sun-drenched afternoon to book a place in Sundays final against third-seeded Serb Novak Djokovic. It feels pretty good, Fish, 26, said in a courtside interview. I couldnt have dreamed up a better scenario than that.         
	Ranked 98th in the world, Fish set the tone for the biggest win of his career by breaking Federer in the second game before sweeping through the opening set in 34 minutes.         
	With the 26-year-old Federer strangely out-of-sorts and Fish in prime form, the American again broke in the first and fifth games of the second before serving out to secure victory in the eighth.         
	Earlier, Australian Open champion Djokovic, 20, broke Nadal twice in each set to secure victory in one hour 28 minutes and it seemed three-set victories in his two previous matches finally caught up with Nadal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Trophy dates next month
                                                                                                                                                                                           Trophy dates next month
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday deferred a decision on the new dates of the Champions Trophy till next month but said Pakistan still retained the right to host the tournament.         
	The governing body also said that some boards have objected to the staging of the eight-nation tournament in October next year.         
	The ICC board and Chief Executives Committee (CEC), after a two-day meeting, decided that CEO Haroon Lorgat would engage member boards in this regard and discuss the matter next month.         
	India had objected to that date because of the ODI series against Australia during the same time and ICC president David Morgan said in Dubai that there was still disagreement over the ICCs plan to hold the tournament in October 2009.         
	Lorgat will engage with member boards likely to be affected by the rescheduling of the tournament to September/October 2009 and he would report back to the ICC board on the result of that engagement at its next meeting, in October, Morgan said.         
	Pakistan were scheduled to host the Champions Trophy this month, but the ICC postponed it after several teams refused to participate due to security concerns.         
	Morgan said the ICC did not seek an alternative host to Pakistan during the councils meeting.         
	The CEC also decided to continue the trial of Umpire Referrals system, which took place in the recent Sri Lanka-India Test series, to some upcoming series before its actual implementation.         
	A final report on the Referrals will be submitted by ICC umpires and referees manager Vince van der Bijl and ICC umpires manager Doug Cowie after the trials to ICC cricket committee in May next year and it will then be considered by the CEC in June.         
	The primacy of ICC events over bilateral series was also restated during the meeting besides the Future Tours Programme (FTP) post 2012.         
	With the current FTP due to conclude in May 2012, the concept of an alternative structure to bilateral tours, including the possibility of an enhanced Test championship, was discussed and majority of the boards supported further exploration of the enhanced model.         
	The key considerations for both the ICC Board and the CEC are:         
	 All three formats of international cricket should be promoted with Test cricket identified as the pinnacle of the sport.         
	 The icon Test series must be protected.         
	 The concept of a Test Championship should be explored further.

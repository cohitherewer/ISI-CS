The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sp. show no mercy to CPT

            A STAFF REPORTER            Mike Okoro skips past a Calcutta Port Trust defender at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Images of Mohun Bagan fans leaving their home ground smearing each other in the club colours of green and maroon, anticipating the league win on Tuesday (after beating Camellia George Telegraph) must surely have miffed Mohammedan Sporting players, who considered themselves to be very much in the hunt. And they showed why by thumping Calcutta Port Trust 4-1 in their Sahara CFL Premier Division encounter on Wednesday at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Knowing that they needed goals and that too as many as possible, to have any chance of edging Mohun Bagan on goal difference, if it comes to that, Mohammedan Sporting turned it on from the word go. Spectators had barely settled down when the irresistible Theodore Sunday opened the scoring for his side in the second minute. Port Trust captain Simanto Das delayed with the ball at his feet deep inside his own half and the Liberian marksman stole it off him in no time. Sunday raced ahead and slotted it past Port Trust custodian Subhash Singha Roy.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, playing attractive football and keeping possession, doubled the lead in the 32nd minute through Mike Okoro. Jyothi Kumar started the move by releasing Mir Farooque Hyder down the left flank. Hyder then picked out Okoro with a well directed cross, and the Nigerian made no mistake, striking from range. Atrocious defending saw Biswajit Bhattacharjees men slip further as Jyothi Kumar scored in first half added time. Subhash Singha Roy who had a shocker of an outing, panicked after receiving a back pass from right back Rajib Rao and passed it onto Jyothi Kumar, who had an open goal to aim at and predictably made no mistakes.         
	Port Trust added some respectability to the scoreline with a second half goal from Ayeni Bidemi Daniel. But the goal of the game came from Mike Okoro, who surely loves toying with his critics  showing his old form at will and disappointing on other days. The Nigerian latched on to a loose ball near the centre line and raced down the right touchline leaving defenders for dead. Once inside the D a stinging shot flew off his boot laces, beating Port Trusts substitute keeper Sibram Dey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib, Asif in Pakistan shortlist
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shoaib, Asif in Pakistan shortlist
                      
	Karachi: Controversial Pakistani pace duo of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif Wednesday got some reprieve after the national selectors included them in the shortlist of 35 players for the Champions Trophy, although the final decision on their participation rests on the Board.         
	Sources close to the selectors said that a shortlist of 35 players had been sent to the Board out of which 30 probables would be approved for the tournament.         
	The selectors have included Shoaib and Asif because they believe that since there is much time left before the start of the Champions Trophy, they should not be ignored for selection, one source said.         
	The selectors believe that if available they should play for Pakistan and strengthen the pace attack, he added.         
	However, there is still uncertainty about the duos participation in the biennial event.         
	Shoaib is available for selection as the Lahore high court has suspended his 18 months ban last week, at least until the court hears his writ petition scheduled for sometime in September.         
	But the PCB remains sceptical about the temperamental fast bowlers present fitness and ability to last out in a big tournament.         
	As far as Asif is concerned PCBs three-man fact finding committee is yet to start their investigation for his 19-day detention in Dubai over alleged possession of a contraband substance.         
	Though Asif was cleared by the public prosecutor in Dubai and repatriated to Pakistan without any charges, yet the Board is facing a problem because his incident allegedly involves drugs and the ICC follows a zero tolerance policy in this regard.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its blow No. 3 for Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its blow No. 3 for Sourav
                  Sourav                     
	Given his stature, it wouldnt have been the most fitting for Sourav, but the senior national selectors wouldve thrown a lifeline had they named him as Sachin Tendulkars replacement in the Rest squad for the Irani Trophy.         
	As it turned out, Dilip Vengsarkar and Co. ignored Sourav and, in choosing the in-form Subramaniam Badrinath as Sachins replacement for the September 24-28 showdown in Vadodara, landed blow No.3 for the year on our most successful Test captain.         
	The first was when they overlooked Sourav for the tri-series in Australia. That was around the third week of January.         
	Then, earlier this month, he wasnt chosen in the Rest squad, even though the Irani Trophy has been given the status of a trial match in the lead-up to the four-Test series against Australia.         
	Apparently, Sourav had contemplated retirement in the hours immediately after the squad was announced, but obviously decided to see how things unfolded, not least the composition of the new selection committee.         
	Saturdays blow, however, could turn out to be the killer one.         
	One of the outgoing selectors, though, still held out hope.         
	You are free to give your interpretation, but I wouldnt say Sourav should quit The next committee may view things differently The team for the first Test (in Bangalore, from October 9) will be picked by our successors, he told The Telegraph.         
	Meanwhile, according to well-placed sources, quite a few who wish to become part of the historic (because of the professional nature) committee have been actively lobbying with some of the most influential in the Board of Control for Cricket in India.         
	From former presidents to those set to hold important positions after the September 27-28 AGM The aspirants arent leaving anything to chance.         
	Eventually, then, more than credentials its the networking skills which could prove decisive.         
	That would be a pity.           LPS

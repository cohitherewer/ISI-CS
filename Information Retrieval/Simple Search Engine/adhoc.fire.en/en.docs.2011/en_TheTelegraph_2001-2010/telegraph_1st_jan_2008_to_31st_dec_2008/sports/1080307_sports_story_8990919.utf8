The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lampard once again the Blue-eyed boy
                                                     Lampard once again the Blue-eyed boy
  - Chelsea take advantage of Greeks bearing gifts       HENRY WINTER               Lampard and Drogba celebrate Chelseas win on Wednesday                                 
	Chelsea meted out the same treatment to Olympiakos that the Greeks inflict on their dinner plates. Olympiakos defence, as brittle as ancient crockery, was smashed into countless pieces by Chelseas superb attacking. The only surprise was that the Londoners managed only three goals.         
	Michael Ballack, Frank Lampard and Salomon Kalou all scored while Lampard delivered one of those fine, box-to-box performances that marks him out as one of the best midfielders at work in Europe.         
	No Petr Cech, no Michael Essien, no John Obi Mikel, no Nicolas Anelka, no problem. Chelseas resources are so deep that they take any tinkering, any injuries in their quick-moving stride. Lampard, contentiously omitted for the first leg in Athens, was terrific, creating Ballacks early goal, scoring himself and constantly being at the heart of all that was good about Chelsea.         
	Lampards vision and passing were swiftly in evidence. Seizing on Ashley Coles quick throw-in after five minutes, Lampard had already noted his teammates forward runs. Two touches nudged the ball in from the left-hand touchline. Lampards third picked out Ballack magnificently, the ball bent towards the near post for the German to beat the static Antonios Nikopolidis with a firm, well-placed header.         
	It resembled one of those training-ground rehearsals where defenders are told to hold their positions while the attackers hone their art. Olympiakos could have brought over four statues from the Parthenon and reacted to Chelseas movement more adroitly.         
	The next thrust of the Chelsea knife brought more pain. Another panicky Olympiakos clearance after 25 minutes was met by Claude Makelele, whose clever header found Terry tucked in on the right. Chelseas captain immediately sent Ballack through and Olympiakos were cut open. Again.         
	The German unleashed a strong shot that Nikopolidis got a hand to, but merely diverted into the path of Lampard. On a night of Greeks bearing gifts, the England international gratefully accepted the easiest of tap-ins that almost arrived in pretty wrapping, a nice bow and a note saying help yourself.         
	Three minutes after the break Lampard created a third. Over swirled the corner, catching out Olympiakos, Didier Drogba getting a slight touch and sending the ball on to Kalou. Controlling the ball with his thigh, Kalou flicked it home expertly.         
	Olympiakos coach Panagiotis Lemonis tried to breathe some life into his team, and introduced Fernando Belluschi.         
	Amazingly, Olympiakos finally gave Carlo Cudicini something to think about. For an hour, the keeper understudying for the injured Cech had just watched events from afar. For an hour, Cudicini could have wandered down the Kings Road, perhaps done some late-night shopping and even grabbed a pizza, before returning to the Bridge without anyone noticing his absence.         
	Even when Belluschi delivered a decent free kick over Chelseas wall, Cudicini hardly had to move far to collect the ball. Moments later he clutched Leonardos corner and launched a counter-attack that brought chances for Joe Cole and Makelele, both saved by Nikopolidis.         
	Lampard, whose ludicrous weekend sending-off at West Ham was rightly rescinded, then suffered another on-field injustice when he was cautioned for diving, another decision devoid of logic. Caught accidentally by Christos Patsatzoglou in the area, Lampard was bowled over. The combination of gravity plus speed of collision meant Lampard had little choice but to fall down.         
	Grant decided to spare Lampard any more poor decisions and called him to the bench to be replaced by Essien. As Lampard walked off, Chelsea fans stood as one to salute their inspired No.8. Chelseas coach then withdrew Joe Cole for Shaun Wright-Phillips and, with Florent Malouda already on for Kalou, this meant Drogba had to complete this dead tie.         
	Draining the squads leading striker seemed strange, unless Grant intends resting Drogba for Saturdays FA Cup quarter final exertions at Oakwell. One thing is sure: Barnsley will give Chelsea more of a game than Olympiakos.         
	Belluschi shivered the bar late on, and then Cudicini saved magnificently from Paraskevas Antzas but Chelsea were already home and hosed in the Champions League quarter-finals.

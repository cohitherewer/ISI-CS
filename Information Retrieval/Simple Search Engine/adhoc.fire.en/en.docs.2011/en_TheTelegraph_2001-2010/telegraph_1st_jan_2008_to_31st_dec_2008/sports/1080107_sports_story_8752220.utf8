	Sydney: Former Australia captain Bill Lawry has been a keen watcher of Indian cricket. On Sunday, as the second Test headed towards a stunning finish, he spoke to The Telegraph on the Indian captains. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
       
	On captaincy 
    
	I think, generally, captaincy is a little bit overrated... Without going into names, some very good captains led ordinary sides and nobody even recognised them... But if youre captaining Australia, well, you could win 15 Tests on the trot... 
    
	On what captains need to do 
    
	Do their best and get the best out of the talent available to them... Of course, if they dont have the socks, then they cant pull them up. 
    
	On his role model captain
 
	Richie Benaud. He set the standard for others to follow. 
       
	On the (regular) Indian captains he played against in Australia and the ones he has seen lead in these parts (in chronological order): 
    
	Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi (1967-68): Tiger, I thought, was a very good captain. He was, in fact, a courageous batsman as well... Tiger led from the front and, obviously, had the respect of his players.. What I remember most is Tigers gutsy batting in that series and the way he handled Erapalli Prasanna... Not all Indian batsmen were fond of facing quicks, but Tiger was game... He didnt flinch. Tiger didnt have a genuine pace attack and, so, was handicapped. Still, in my book, Tiger has been Indias finest captain. 
    
	Bishan Singh Bedi (1977-78): Bedi was hugely popular, but I dont think he was in Tigers class as a captain. 
    
	Sunil Gavaskar (1981-82): Certainly one of the all-time greats as a batsman, in the Allan Border mould. However, good captains dont try to get their batsmen off the ground (as Gavaskar attempted at the MCG in that series, with current manager Chetan Chauhan being the batsman in question)... 
    
	Kapil Dev (1985-86): Never too expressive, I thought, but a beautiful player... I cant think of any outstanding moves he made as captain in Australia, but stood tall as a cricketer... He was certainly positive... Of course, its known that he took India to its only World Cup win (1983). 
    
	Mohammed Azharuddin (1991-92): Had tremendous flair as a batsman and was another who tried to lead by example... I remember the hundred he got at the Adelaide Oval, it was so fluent... He was also a terrific fieldsman and it makes a difference if the captains such a fine fielder... It lifts the team... The big problem with the present Indian side is its fielding... To compete with the best, you need to have 7 of the 11 as top-class fielders. 
         Bill Lawry
  
	Sachin Tendulkar (1999-00): A great batsman, but probably didnt want to be captain... Its hard being the teams best batsman and captain... Without the captaincy, hes got no fears as a batsman. 
    
	Sourav Ganguly (2003-04): I found Ganguly to be an interesting captain... His 144 in the first Test (Brisbane) was an outstanding innings and set the tone for that series... Despite the perceived weakness against the short-pitched deliveries, he didnt take a backwards step... India did win at Adelaide, but Ganguly must take the blame for not being able to force a win at the SCG... India, in my view, shouldve won that Test... They werent positive enough. 
    
	Anil Kumble (2007-08): I havent seen much of him... His bowling changes have been fine, but some of his field placements have been suspect... On the first morning at the MCG, for example, one saw mid-on and mid-off so deep... Kumble needed to create pressure... Having said that, Ive liked the way he has been handling the media... Hes been saying the right things. 
    
	Finally, on the captains whove impressed him besides Pataudi 
    
	Ian Chappell... Border in the later years of his career... Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting... But, then, weve also dominated world cricket from around 1989... Taylor and Steve had it easy because Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath were available throughout... The real Test for Ponting is now, when both have retired.

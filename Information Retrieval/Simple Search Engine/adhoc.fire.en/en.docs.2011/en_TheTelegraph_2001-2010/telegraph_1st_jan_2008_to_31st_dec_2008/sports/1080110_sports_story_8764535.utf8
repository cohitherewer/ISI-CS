	Perfect Chemistry, a Z. Darashah-trained mare, just about managed to beat the course favourite, Satin Slipper, to claim division I of the Solitaire Cup, at the Mysore races on Wednesday. Jockey Gnaneshwar partnered the winner. The lower division title of the trophy was, however, lifted by strongly fancied Show N Tell, also a mare, trained by Ravi Shanker and ridden by Pradip Chouhan.RESULTS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India look to be consistent
                                                                                                                                                                                                       India look to be consistent
  - We are not going to take Hong Kong lightly, says captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni             Coach Gary Kirsten and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni during a practice session in Karachi on Tuesday. (AFP)                           
	Karachi: India launch their campaign in the Asia Cup cricket tournament against minnows Hong Kong here on Wednesday, hoping to get into top form ahead of their crucial tie against arch-rivals Pakistan on Thursday.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis men should not face much resistance from Hong Kong, whom they are facing for the first time, but the Indians are in no mood to take their opponents lightly in what is likely to be a one-sided floodlit contest at the National Stadium. The Indians will go into the game without the services of pacer Irfan Pathan, who will be rested because of a side strain. But the Indians have enough bowling resources at their disposal to counter Hong Kong.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten warned his players not to get too complacent against their unfancied rivals. I am looking for some big contributions from my players in the match. We will take every opposition seriously as this is the Asia Cup and we will play proper cricket and will do the things we need to do, Kirsten said.         
	The Indians, seeking to make amends after their defeat to Pakistan in the tri-series final in Bangladesh, have an enviable track record in Pakistan in recent time. But captain Dhoni is not banking on statistics.         
	We are not going to take any team lightly, Dhoni said. I am happy with the team combination. I feel it is a good opportunity for the aspiring youngsters in such a big tournament. It is also a challenge for seasoned players to perform in it, he said.         
	In the batting department, the Indian team do not have much to worry about with the two left-handers, Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhir, in fine nick, having played some brilliant innings during the tri-nation series in Bangladesh. Dhoni indicated that he would come up the batting order. I will definitely try to bat up the order depending on what kind of start we get. We float our batsmen depending on the number of overs left in the game, he said.                     
	The Hong Kong coach Aftab Habib, however, insisted his team would not go down without a fight against their strong opponents. We have this advantage that most of the guys are from Pakistan and have cricket in their blood. We know the Indians are a very strong outfit but we will go out there and just do our best, Habib, a former England cricketer, said.         
	Meanwhile, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene knows only too well the two best teams in the Asia Cup stand between his team and a title defence.         
	If we have to win this tournament, we have to beat the best, Jayawardene said on Tuesday  a day before the 2004 champions take on Bangladesh in their opening match of group B. It is very important for us as we are the defending champions of the Asia Cup and (also) the World Cup finalists, the veteran batsman said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer, Ishant add extra edge: Waugh
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Zaheer, Ishant add extra edge: Waugh
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh has been highly impressed by the performance of the Indian pace bowlers. He feels that Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma have given India an extra edge in the current series.         
	Waugh, who was present during Australias training session at the Kotla on Monday, said: I think Indian bowling has really come of age and now they are quite capable of taking 20 wickets in a match.         
	Heaping praise on Zaheer and Ishant, Waugh added: Earlier, it was all about Indias spin bowling but now Zaheer and Ishant are doing well. They are good at reverse swing too. There was a time when we were only worried about spin bowling in India. Now things have changed.         
	Waugh was in the capital to attend the two-day MCC Cricket Committee meeting.         
	The former Australian captain said that Indias performance in the series had been very good so far but was not sure whether the home team would be able to maintain the same standard in the next two Test matches.         
	India were outstanding in Mohali, no doubt about that. They have set a very high standard and I think the pressure is now on them to maintain that. In a way, the pressure is now off Australias shoulder.         
	The big question is whether Australia can now bounce back. They have certainly got the character and I hope they have the confidence as well. (Ricky) Ponting, (Matthew) Hayden, (Michael) Clarke, (Michael) Hussey a lot would rest on the shoulders of the senior players, Waugh asserted.         
	Asked what brought him to the Australian nets, Waugh smiled and said: I just came to have a look at their practice session.         
	Waugh had a long chat with skipper Ponting, Hayden and Brett Lee but denied that he was at the nets to offer any tips to Aussie players.         
	Hayden has 42 runs from four innings while Ponting, who scored a century in the opening Test in Bangalore, scored just five and two in Mohali.         
	Lee has taken just four wickets in the two Tests, looking a pale shadow of his former self.         
	I did not give any tips to any of them, Waugh said. I know they are down 0-1. So I just told them to relax and not to think much about the result.         
	Waugh said he had no advice for Hayden, who has been struggling for runs in the ongoing series.         
	He is too good a batsman. He knows when to rise to the occasion, commented Waugh.         
	All Hayden needs is to spend some time in the middle. He is a world class batsman and runs will automatically come, observed the former captain.         
	Australia are definitely under pressure to make a comeback in the series and judging by their practice session this morning, all of them looked intense, Waugh added.

					 PCB drops Shoaib, Sami contracts
 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has dropped fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami from the list of players who will get new central contracts this month. PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf announced on Friday that the two pacers and opener Imran Nazir had not been given an annual central contract because of fitness and performance issues.
 ldquo;The players not given central contracts have been given special retainers and if they show commitment and form they can come back into the team after a year, rdquo; he said.

 Ashraf said the PCB had deliberated on the central contracts issue for over two hours in Friday rsquo;s meeting. He said they felt it should not be treated as an employment contract.

 The 15 players given central contracts are:
 Category A: Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik, Misbah-ul Haq, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Yousuf. Monthly retainer 250,000 rupees.
 Category B: Kamran Akmal, Sohail Tanvir, Shahid Afridi, Salman Butt, Umar Gul. 175,000. 
 Category C: Abdul Rehman, Yasir Arafat, Rao Iftikhar, Danish Kaneria, Fawad Alam. 100,000. 
 
	 Farhat case
 Karachi: Pakistan opener Imran Farhat said on Friday he will reopen his court case against the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after its decision to keep the ban on players signing for the rebel Indian Cricket League.
 PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf told a news conference the governing board had decided unanimously to keep the international and domestic ban. ldquo;We had stopped legal proceedings because we thought the board would resolve the issue amicably. But now they leave me no option and I will go to court, rdquo; Farhat said.
 Farhat and Taufiq Umar filed a petition against the ban in the Lahore High Court this month but withdrew it hoping the PCB would reverse its decision. 
 
	 Chawla keen 
 Moradabad: Young leg-spinner Piyush Chawla wants to chip in with some valuable runs down the order besides unsettling the opposition batsmen with his bowling in the upcoming tri-series in Australia.
 ldquo;If I am adding 15 or 20 runs at eight or nine down that will be a good contribution. I am looking forward to doing it, rdquo; Chawla said. ldquo;I hope to perform to my potential there. I want to cement my place in the side, rdquo; he said. The Uttar Pradesh bowler felt he does not need to try out new things in Australia. ldquo;I have visited Australia before and I know a bit about the nature of wicket there. That should not be a problem. Moreover, there are seniors in the team who will help me out, rdquo; he said. 
 
	 Award for Glenn
 Melbourne: Apart from claiming victims on a 22-yard strip, former Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath has proved that he can also earn distinction for saving people off the pitch after he was named among the Members of the Order of Australia recipients. McGrath and his wife Jane were named in the Australia Day honours list on Friday for their ldquo;service to community health through support for women with breast cancer and the establishment of the McGrath Foundation rdquo;.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kanpur: A grateful Mahendra Singh Dhoni sent a thanksgiving note and Rs 10,000 to Green Park Stadiums pitch curator for preparing the turning track that helped the hosts level the series 1-1 with a win over South Africa in the third Test here.         
	Curator Shiv Kumar said he was pleasantly surprised to receive a personal note of thanks and the cash reward from the stand-in Test skipper after the hosts beat the Proteas inside three days on a crumbling pitch.         
	Main kabhi soch bhi nahin sakta ke Dhoni mujhe yeh gift denge. Yeh mere achhe kaam ka inaam hai, the curator said.         
	Kumar said regular Test skipper Anil Kumble, who missed the decider due to a groin injury, also came down to meet and thank him for preparing the spinner-friendly pitch after the match.         
	Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who won the Man of the Series award for taking 19 wickets, also met Kumar to praise and thank him.         
	However, Kumar maintained that the Green Park wicket was a sporting one and it was unfair to say that it only aided the slower bowlers.         
	The South African batsmen just couldnt get used to it (the pitch) and were unsure of how the ball would behave, he said.

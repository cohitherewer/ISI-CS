	Nalchik (Russia): Grandmaster Koneru Humpy suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Chinese Yifan Hao in the first game of the semi-finals of the Womens World Chess championship on Thursday.         
	The Indian, who started as the highest rated player in the knock-out championship, will now have to win the return game on Thursday to remain in contention.         
	As the rules are if the results are tied after two games, tiebreak games of shorter duration are played to determine the winner. Playing in third world championship, Humpy will be under pressure in the return game.

                                                   Delhi win Ranji after 16 years

           
	Mumbai: Delhi fought back brilliantly to crush Uttar Pradesh by nine wickets with more than a day to spare and regain the Ranji Trophy after 16 years on Saturday. 
    
	Delhi conceded a 52-run first innings lead after making 290 in reply to UPs 342. They then set themselves up for victory by dismissing UP for paltry 177 runs in the second innings and rattling up 230 for one to win the final on the fourth and penultimate day. 
    
	It was Delhis seventh national crown and the first since they beat Tamil Nadu at home in 1991-92. 
    
	Left-arm swing bowler Pradeep Sangwan captured five for 46 in second innings and then opener Gautam Gambhir slammed his second century on the trot, an unbeaten 130 from 155 balls with 17 fours, to pilot Delhi to a comprehensive victory three minutes after tea. 
    
	The left-handed Gambhir, expected to make the India squad for next months triangular ODI series in Australia which is to be chosen on Sunday, put on 91 runs for the first wicket with first innings centurion Aakash Chopra (33). 
    
	It was Gambhirs second Ranji Trophy century on the trot, having reached three figures in the semi-finals against Baroda in Indore. 
    
	 He also added quick 139 runs with No. 3 batsman Shikhar Dhawan (54 in 100 balls with seven fours) for the unbroken second wicket to help Delhi surge to victory in the second over after tea.

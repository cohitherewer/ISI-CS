The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mosley stays at helm
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mosley stays at helm
                      
	Paris: Max Mosley won a vote of confidence Tuesday to remain FIA president despite being involved in a sex scandal, and the German motoring federation responded by breaking off co-operation with the sports governing body.         
	Mosley won a secret ballot 103-55  with seven abstentions and four invalid votes  at the specially convened assembly in Paris.         
	The 68-year-old Englishman now appears set to continue leading motor racings governing body through October 2009 when his fourth term ends.         
	The decision could lead to a split within the FIA, with a breakaway by many of the leading clubs who had publicly called on Mosley to resign.         
	The German motoring federation Adac, which is Europes largest automobile organisation, said it has frozen all its activities with FIA.         
	Adac will stay with its decision as long as Max Mosley holds the top FIA office of president, it said in a statement.         
	The German, American, Japanese, French, Australian and Spanish auto federations all voted against Mosley.         
	Mosley, who has been president since 1994, called the vote after refusing to resign when a British newspaper said he had engaged in Nazi-themed sex acts with prostitutes.         
	A video showed Mosley arriving at a London apartment and then engaging in various sex acts with several women, at least one in a prisoners uniform, while also speaking German. Mosley, who is suing The News of the World newspaper in British and French courts, admits to hiring the five prostitutes but denies there were any Nazi connotations.         
	Anthony Scrivener, a lawyer who was hired by the FIA to independently investigate the Nazi links, supported his claim. He told the assembly there was no proof of such connotations.         
	Mosley made his case to the assembly, which was also given a chance to air its views on the affair that has overshadowed motor racing since late March.         
	With the presentations concluded, each member dropped their sealed vote into the ballot box. Lawyers for the FIA, accompanied by four members chosen during the meeting to act as independent scrutinisers, retired to count the vote. Nineteen of the votes were received by proxy.         
	Delegates said Mosley gave a strong speech during the meeting, laying out his reasons for wanting to stay on.           (AP)

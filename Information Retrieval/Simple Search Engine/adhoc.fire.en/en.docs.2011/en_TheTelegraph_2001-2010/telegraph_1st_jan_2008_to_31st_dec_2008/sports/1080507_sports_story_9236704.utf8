The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cristiano will be best in the world: Queiroz 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cristiano will be best in the world: Queiroz 
            OLIVER BROWN in LISBON                      
	Carlos Queiroz is as awed as any by Cristiano Ronaldos accomplishment in reaching 40 goals for the season, but on Monday Manchester Uniteds assistant manager claimed the feat was just the beginning of the wingers path to becoming the best in the world.         
	Bracketing Ronaldo in the great Portuguese canon of Eusebio and Luis Figo, Queiroz explained that his exceptional talents reflected not merely his flamboyant trickery and magic steps, but also an intense work ethic.         
	To score 40 goals is unbelievable  I wished I could have guessed it at the start of the season, Queiroz told The Daily Telegraph.         
	The best of it is the chance he has in front of him in the coming years. He is too young to rest or relax  this is just the beginning. Thousands of children all over the world see Cristiano and they dream about him, they want to touch him. But Cristianos game is also about smart work, discipline, commitment.         
	Queiroz has a strong personal influence upon Ronaldo, and upon others in Uniteds Portuguese-speaking coterie  notably Nani and Anderson, whom the 55-year-old was instrumental in attracting to Old Trafford a year ago in a 30 million deal.         
	He agreed with a widely shared assessment that the one element missing from the wingers claim to true greatness was his inconsistency in the biggest games, and that the Champions League final against Chelsea on May 21 offered a chance to defy the doubters.         
	What would you have expected from Michael Schumacher in a Formula One race? Its the same with Cristiano. We expect the best. That is the pressure that we put upon ourselves.         
	While Queiroz has recently been linked to a move to Benfica at the end of the season, his future appeared intrinsically linked with that of United on Monday as he attended the launch of their latest Soccer Schools project in Lisbon.         
	The former Real Madrid first-team coach remains an iconic figure in the city, and is attempting to use his background in Portuguese youth development to inspire children from Oeiras, once a tough suburb, to emulate Ronaldos example.         
	Recalling Portugals former legends, Queiroz said: We dont want another Eusebio; we want to preserve Eusebio. That is the best tribute you can pay to great players. After Eusebio came Luis Figo, again the best player in the world at the time.         
	We hope that Cristiano can be the best, too, but we want to teach the children to be themselves. At United, we dont reproduce people.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

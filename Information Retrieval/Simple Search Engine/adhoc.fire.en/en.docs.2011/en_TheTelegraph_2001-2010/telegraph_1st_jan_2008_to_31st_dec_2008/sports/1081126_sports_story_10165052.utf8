                                                                                                                                                                                                     Railways 37 runs from victory
                      
	New Delhi: Medium-pacer Anureet Singh blew away Andhras top-order while off-spinner Kulamani Parida polished the tail to put Railways 37 runs away from victory in the Ranji Trophy group B super league match on Tuesday.         
	Resuming on 208 for eight in their first innings, Railways eventually folded for 227, thus eking out a 19-run first innings lead.         
	The Railways bowlers then returned to shoot out Andhra for 108 in 44.3 overs with Anureet and Parida sharing eight wickets between them.         
	Chasing 90 for a win, Railways were 53 for two at stumps with Miling Tamhane (17) and Harshan Rawle (4) in the middle.         
	Anureet came up with a wonderful spell and inside 21 overs Andhra were gasping for breath at 52 for four with the right-arm medium-pacer claiming all four wickets.         
	B. Sumanth (25) showed some resistance but Murali Kartik trapped him plumb in front and then Parida tied the middle and lower-order batsmen in tangles to fold the visitors inside 45 overs.         
	Only four Andhra batsmen managed double digit figures with Sumanth their topscorer.         
	In another match in Hyderabad, unbeaten knocks of 93 and 86 by Rajesh Bishnoi and Robin Bisht helped Rajasthan post 267 for three in the first innings against Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International stadium.

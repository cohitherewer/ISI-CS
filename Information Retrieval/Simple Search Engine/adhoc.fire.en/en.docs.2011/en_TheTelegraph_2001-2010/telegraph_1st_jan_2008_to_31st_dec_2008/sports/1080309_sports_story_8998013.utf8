The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tour has changed my life, says Ishant
                                                     Tour has changed my life, says Ishant
                  Ishant Sharma                     
	New Delhi: The 54 balls that he bowled to the worlds top-ranked Test batsman, Ricky Ponting, was the turning point of his life, says Indias pace sensation Ishant Sharma.         
	The gangly 64 Delhi speedster, hailed as the find of the just-concluded Australian tour, has a cool head despite being thrust into the limelight suddenly.         
	The 19-year-old cricketer said: The nine overs during which I bowled Ponting out (in Perth) are very important for me. That was the turning point of my life. This tour was very crucial for me. It has changed my whole life.         
	Big bucks, hysterical fans and media adulation that comes with cricket stardom have not gone to his head.         
	Everyone tells me dont forget from where youve come. Never forget your roots, said Ishant, son of an air conditioner mechanic.         
	While Ponting lavished praise on Ishant for producing outstanding spells, his predecessor Steve Waugh described the Delhiite as next best thing in Indian cricket.         
	It is a good sign that every one has words of praise for me. To get a compliment from a great batsman like Ricky Ponting motivates me, said the bowler, who emerged Indias highest wicket-taker with 14 scalps from nine matches in the tri-series.         
	Asked if all this praise also put pressure on him, Ishant said it had only a positive influence on him.         
	Sometimes it can motivate you, sometime it can put pressure on you. It all depends on whether you take it in positive way or negatively. I take it positively so I derive motivation from all these and it is certainly going to help me if I am ever down, he said.         
	He, however, acknowledged that it was a good feeling to be recognised by everyone.         
	Earlier, hardly anyone knew me but now everyone knows me. Everyone recognises who is Ishant, so it is a good feeling, he said.         
	Ishant, who consistently bowled around 140 kmph, is not trying to be in the league of speedsters like Australias Brett Lee and Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan in terms of pace.         
	I am not thinking about pace, but hitting right lengths and bowling to my strengths. I want to do that consistently. My deliveries also have good bounce. I am not concentrating on pace at all, he said.         
	Given the tough competition in the fast bowling department in India, Ishant said he would not lose heart if he was made to sit out of the team.         
	If Im struggling to find a place in the team I am not going to be disheartened by that because I would know that if someone is selected ahead of me he is doing a better job, he said.         
	Ishant was not unduly worried about possible injuries in view of so much cricket being played nowadays and appeared confident of sustaining himself.         
	If I continue to do the same things which I am doing now I dont think I have to be careful about sustaining myself because I am doing well at present. I am doing the right things, he said.

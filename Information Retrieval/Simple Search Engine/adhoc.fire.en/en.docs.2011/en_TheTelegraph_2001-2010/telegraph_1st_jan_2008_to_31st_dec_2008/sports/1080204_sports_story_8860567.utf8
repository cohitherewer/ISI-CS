                                                   Leander out of tie vs Uzbekistan

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	New Delhi: Leander Paes on Sunday ruled out any possibility of playing in the Davis Cup tie against Uzbekistan next week. 
    
	The Indian captain, who joined the team early morning in the capital, said: My ankle is still strapped a little bit. I can take the court, but in doing so, my ankle can suffer a permanent damage. 
    
	As an athlete and as a captain, my job is to be honest to myself and everyone else in the team. I should be fair to my teammates. And when our team has so many options, why should I take the risk, Paes said. 
    
	Paes hoped that the youngsters in the team should take his absence as an opportunity to show their mettle. It is time for them to take the chance. They should welcome this opportunity with open arms. 
    
	Asked whether Rohan Bopanna would be ready to take part in both singles and doubles, Paes said Bopanna was ready. But all depends on the first day, the captain added. 
    
	Paes also welcomed the decision of Mahesh Bhupathi to return to the Davis Cup team. He is a great player and it is great to have him back in the squad. 
    
	Like all his teammates, Paes, too, feels India are favourites against Uzbekistan. It is simply because of grasscourts here. Thats a huge advantage in favour of our team, he said. 
    
	The Uzbeks are outright favourites when we play them in their country, Paes conceded. But back home here, its the other way round. The Uzbeks perhaps dont even have proper grasscourt shoes. What they are wearing here are claycourt shoes. 
    
	Their strength in singles shouldnt be taken lightly. (Denis) Istomin has improved greatly. I took time out to watch him play in the Australian Open. He did a great job. At the moment, he is playing solid tennis. I found him great on the baseline. 
    
	In doubles, they stand no chance, Paes said emphatically.

	Chennai: Confirming their semi-finals berth, Rajasthan Royals will rest few key players and field fresh faces in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match against Chennai Super Kings on Saturday.         
	Addressing a pre-match press conference here, Royals captain Shane Warne said the team management has decided to preserve a few key players for the knockout phase and test their bench strength in their last three matches.         
	There are a few players in our team who havent had many opportunities or not at all. We have decided to rest a couple of players too and try out some experiments in the batting order.         
	Warne said his team will have to rest some players considering that they will have to play five games over the next nine days if they make it to the IPL final in Mumbai.         
	We now have opportunity to try out different players and assign them different roles. But of course, we would like to maintain our momentum And thats very important. If we get to the final, then it will be five games in nine days, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diego comes a full circle
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Diego comes a full circle
                      
	Glasgow: Diego Maradonas extraordinary career comes full circle when Argentina face Scotland in a friendly at Hampden Park on Wednesday.         
	There have been plentiful highs and lows, including a brush with death in 2004, since Maradona gave a scintillating performance as an 18-year-old in Argentinas 3-1 friendly win over the Scots in February 1979.         
	Whether Maradona, who lifted the World Cup in 1986, can have a positive impact as coach is the question being debated in Buenos Aires and around the world.         
	Of course this is a new start. But Im not looking at it as if I have to show things. Im here to give my support, my experience to the national team, he said.         
	Wednesdays game will be closely monitored by the family of football and he will want it to go better than his World Cup debut as a player, a shock defeat for the-then holders against Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 finals in Spain.         
	For the moment, and in the absence of key players Lionel Messi and Juan Roman Riquelme, Maradona just wants some of his aura to rub off on this generation, having been an inspiration behind the scenes for their Olympic gold medal three months ago.         
	As long as weve got the ball and we get some respect for the jersey Ill go away very calm, Maradona told reporters upon arrival in Glasgow. Im not asking the lads for more, theyve taken some knocks.         
	Argentina have won only one of their last eight matches and were beaten 0-1 by Chile last month, a World Cup qualifying result that led to Alfio Basiles resignation as coach.         
	Thats what Ill ask of them, to play for Maradona, added the 48-year-old. Id have liked to have had them but Argentina cant stand with their arms crossed if they dont have Riquelme and Messi. We have to look for alternatives and we have them.         
	The match should answer questions about who Maradona views as a playmaker, with Independientes Daniel Montenegro a possibility, and where he sees Carlos Tevez fitting in, attacking from deep or as a front man.         
	Porto midfielder Lucho Gonzalez is back after losing favour with Basile while Ezequiel Lavezzi may get the chance to establish himself as more than a bit-part player.         
	On Monday night, however, Celtic ball boy Adam Brown was the surprise hero, earning a big hug from Maradona when he took his first practice session.         
	A low-key workout by the squad ended with Maradona pacing Celtics Parkhead turf looking for something in the grass.         
	His staff took part in the search for the lost item and a dozen ball boys formed a police-style cordon and walked down the pitch before Brown found it, a crucifix on a chain.         
	A joyous Maradona, who had been fairly quiet during the warm-up and a nine-a-side practice game that he refereed, bounded up to the ball boys and embraced Brown.         
	He then gave him his woolly hat in gratitude amid cheers from a few spectators in the stands.         
	Maradona made his customary sign of the cross as he left the pitch, bringing to an end Argentinas visit to Parkhead. (Agencies)

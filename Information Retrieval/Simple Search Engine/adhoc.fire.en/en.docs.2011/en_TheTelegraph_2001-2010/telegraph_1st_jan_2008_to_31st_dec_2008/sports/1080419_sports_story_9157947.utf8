The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crowe pulls up NZ selectors
                                                                                                                                                                                             Crowe pulls up NZ selectors
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Martin Crowe                           
	Bangalore: Former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe has flayed his countrys selection committee (headed by the iconic Sir Richard Hadlee) for hastening Stephen Flemings retirement from Test cricket.         
	I dont know why they were in such a hurry to give Daniel Vettori the captaincy in both forms... Stephen, I feel, couldve captained for at least a year more, Crowe told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking at the Windsor on Friday afternoon, before the Indian Premier League opener at the Chinnaswamy, Crowe added: Its only because the selectors took the captaincy away from Stephen that he decided to quit Test cricket.         
	Fleming had, of course, retired from ODIs after the last World Cup. He bowed out of Test cricket too after the recent home series against England.         
	Crowe, one of the finest captains of his time (remembered, among other things, for opening with offie Dipak Patel in the 1992 World Cup), didnt have kind words for New Zealand coach John Bracewell as well.         
	He curbed Stephens style of captaincy and, generally, has had a very negative influence on our cricket, Crowe pointed out.         
	Hand-picked by captain Rahul Dravid to be a part of the Bangalore Royal Challengers, Crowe is the teams chief cricket officer.

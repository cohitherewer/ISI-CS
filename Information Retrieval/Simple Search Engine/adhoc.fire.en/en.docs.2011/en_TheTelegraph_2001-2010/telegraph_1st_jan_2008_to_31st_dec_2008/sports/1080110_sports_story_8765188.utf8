   SHARP SINGLES - Down Under 
   
	 Some of Australias greatest sportsmen on Wednesday came down heavily on the win at all costs attitude of Ricky Ponting and his team which was damaging the countrys reputation.
 
	Batting legend Neil Harvey and fast bowling great Jeff Thomson were joined by the members of the Sports Australia Hall of Fame in attacking the team for their conduct during the Sydney Test.
 
	Harvey blamed the Australian captain: Ponting should have kept his mouth shut and nothing would have happened. I hope Harbhajan (Singh) gets off on appeal and lets get the game back to normal. That would be the most simple and best way out, Harvey said. He said to him monkey was not a racially offensive term and its a bit rich for the Australians to get on their high horse considering how they act.
 
	Thomson also said Ponting had no business reporting Harbhajan. The Aussies act like morons and bullies and they cant cop criticism from someone like myself.
 
	Equally miffed were the Hall of Famers like John Bertrand. According to him, Its not war. Their desire to win at all costs is beginning to blur their moral compass.
 
	Former Australia pacer and Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson too felt the team did not play the Sydney Test in true spirit of the game and suggested counselling for the men in baggy green.
 
	 Australias Lleyton Hewitt also has seen himself in the position the Indian cricketers are now in. The Australian blasted the standard of tennis umpiring after being bounced out of the Sydney International by big-serving compatriot Chris Guccione on Wednesday.
 
	Hewitt angry like Indians
 
	Hewitt did not concede a break point but was on the wrong end of a 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-2) loss to his Davis Cup teammate in their second round match. I feel like the (Indian) cricketers, I think. Whats going on with all the refs these days? Useless, Hewitt fumed. Hewitt attacked the overall standard of umpiring in tennis as pretty ordinary.
 
	McGrath takes a swipe at ICC 
 
	 Retired Australia pacer Glenn McGrath has lambasted the International Cricket Council which, he felt, caved in to BCCIS pressure and dumped Steve Bucknor from next weeks Perth Test.
 
	According to McGrath, it was ridiculous to replace the umpire just because he had a bad game and the former pacer also called on the ICC to show some leadership instead of bowing down to the Indian board. I think it is sad and disappointing that it gets to the stage where you have a bad game and they are calling for your head, McGrath was quoted saying by The Age. 
 
	What is there, eight international umpires on the panel? And if a couple of teams arent happy with umpires then all of a sudden you have got one to choose from, he said. 
 
	Home support for Punter
 
	 Ricky Pontings home state Tasmani has leapt to the defence of their local Punter, despite opinion polls in Australia showing public support for the Australian captain is on the decline. Local cricketers and politicians have said that Australias dominance of the sport had made Ponting a bigger target and criticised cricket columnist Peter Roebuck for his call to sack Punter, saying its a silly suggestion.

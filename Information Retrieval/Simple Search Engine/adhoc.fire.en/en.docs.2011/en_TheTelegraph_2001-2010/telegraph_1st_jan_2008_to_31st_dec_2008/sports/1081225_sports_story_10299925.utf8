The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | False starts mean the field is wide open
                                                                                                                                                                                                       False starts mean the field is wide open

	Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Rafael Benitez and Luiz Felipe Scolari might all enter Christmas in the belief that their chances of success in the three major competitions remain intact, yet that will surely be accompanied by a lingering irritation at missed opportunities. So far, it has been a season of false starts.         
	Amazingly, the Big Four have not collectively registered even one league victory in six matches over the past 17 days, a sequence that Ladbrokes would have provided odds against of 3,395-1.         
	With Aston Villa providing a welcome challenge, frustration seems to be the dominant emotion emanating from dressing rooms at Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal.         
	Rio Ferdinand this week described Uniteds season as quite mediocre, while John Terry has called for a massive improvement at Chelsea. Arsenals horrible inconsistency has been well documented, while even Jamie Carragher, whose Liverpool team should be the happiest of all, has been lamenting the number of draws this season.         
	Chelsea have been particularly generous over the past month and Scolaris early prediction that he will need 85 per cent of the available points, which equates to a record-breaking tally of 97, looks enormously overstated.         
	Over the past five years when Arsenal, Chelsea and then United have all enjoyed periods of supremacy, the Premier League title has been won with between 87 and 95 points.         
	In recent seasons, the statistics show that the team with the most points against the rest of the big four will almost certainly go on to win the Premier League.         
	This year, however, it already looks very different and, with so many points being dropped in unexpected matches, one lengthy winning streak against the also-rans might just be enough to clinch the title.

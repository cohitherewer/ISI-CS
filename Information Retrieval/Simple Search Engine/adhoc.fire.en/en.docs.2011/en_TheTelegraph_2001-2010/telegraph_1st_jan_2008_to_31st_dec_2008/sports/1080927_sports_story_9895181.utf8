The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raj Singh struck by Alzheimers
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Raj Singh struck by Alzheimers
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI             Dungarpur                           
	Mumbai: Raj Singh Dungarpur, the lively former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, has been struck by Alzheimers.         
	Raj Singh is, in fact, quite ill and wont be attending the AGM, here on Saturday. He has even stepped aside as the Cricket Club of India (CCI) president, an institution whose profile he raised enormously.         
	Despite the illness, which has made it necessary for him to always be accompanied by two attendants, Raj Singh made an effort to be cheerful when The Telegraph spoke to him at the CCI (where he stays) on Friday.         
	Im as you see me... Id say Im better, Indian crickets raconteur No.1 said.         
	Former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindra too felt Raj Singh was slightly better. The last time, he couldnt recognise me... It was very depressing...         
	The one-time Central Zone and Rajasthan quick has, however, lost much weight and well-wishers have been distressed seeing him in the condition hes in.

	ICC confirms Bindra role as adviser  Calcutta: ICC president David Morgan confirmed on Sunday that he had agreed with Inderjit Bindra the scope of the latter rsquo;s role as ICC principal adviser. Bindra, a former president of the BCCI and a key figure in the success of two ICC cricket World Cups in the Asian sub-continent in 1987 and 1996, has been engaged initially on a two-year consultancy agreement, says A Staff Reporter.  The current Punjab Cricket Association president will focus on developing the game in China, assisting relations between the ICC and its members and working with host members to ensure the success of ICC events.    
	 Shoaib stint  Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has cleared controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar to play a couple of matches for English county Surrey in September. Sources in the board confirmed that Shoaib had asked for the PCB nod after being approached by Surrey who wanted him to play two or three matches with the season closing.     
	Younis move  Karachi: Senior Pakistan batsman Younis Khan is all set to play for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield that gets underway in October. With Pakistan without a Test series this year, Younis has started the process of getting a work permit and visa to play for the Australian state side in the domestic competition.     
	 PCB attempt  Karachi: Aware of the fact that players with humble backgrounds often struggle with their fame and success, the PCB will soon launch an ambitious programme aimed at providing specialised coaching and higher education opportunities to the young players at the same time.   The board is starting a programme under which it hopes to have a pool of around 500 young players ready after five years having got formal cricket coaching as well as Cambridge lsquo;O rsquo; level education.    
	 Geoff unhappy  Karachi: The Australian coach of the Pakistan team Geoff Lawson has described as ldquo;very disappointing rdquo; the decision by some countries not to send their teams to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy leading to the postponement of the eight-nation competition last week. Lawson had gone to Australia and New Zealand as a member of the ICC task force to convince the officials and players there that it was safe to play the tournament in Pakistan but didn rsquo;t meet with success.    
	 Bangla scared   Darwin: Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons conceded his side were intimidated by the Australian pace bowlers in their disappointing 180-run loss here. ldquo;A couple of the guys had it in their mind about Mitchell Johnson and so on, and I don rsquo;t think Mitchell bowled that fast, rdquo; Siddons said. ldquo;We can take away the unknown now. They rsquo;ve seen Geeves, they rsquo;ve seen Mitchell Johnson. They don rsquo;t need to be frightened of their pace any more. rdquo;

	London: Ten-man Arsenal ended a six-year Premier League jinx at Bolton Wanderers, fighting back from two goals down for a 3-2 win that lifted them back into second place on Saturday.         
	Midfielder Matthew Taylor put Bolton two up in the first half but Arsenal, who had Abou Diaby sent off in the 31st minute for a high tackle on Gretar Steinsson, hit back with three goals in the last half hour.         
	Arsenal leapfrogged Chelsea, who entertain Middlesbrough on Sunday, into second place, three points behind Manchester United before the leaders host Aston Villa later on Saturday.         
	Captain William Gallas put Arsenal, who had not won at the Reebok Stadium in their previous five league visits and had lost on their last three, back into the match when he turned in Cesc Fabregass corner in the 63rd minute.         
	Robin van Persie equalised with a penalty five minutes later after Gary Cahill brought down Alexander Hleb and Fabregass 90th-minute shot was deflected in by J. Lloyd Samuel as Arsenal ended a run of five league games without victory.         
	Derby County were relegated after a 2-2 draw at home to Fulham, Birmingham Citys 3-1 win over Manchester City sealing the bottom teams fate.         
	Argentine striker Mauro Zarate scored twice for Birmingham who stayed clear of the drop zone, where Bolton remain mired along with Fulham with six games to go.         
	Portsmouth notched a fourth successive home win for the first time in the Premier League when they beat Wigan Athletic 2-0.           (REUTERS)

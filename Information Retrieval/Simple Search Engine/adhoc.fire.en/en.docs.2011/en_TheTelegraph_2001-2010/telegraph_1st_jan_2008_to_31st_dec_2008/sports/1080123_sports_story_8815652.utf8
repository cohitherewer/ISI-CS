                                                    Ian: Ponting a better captain than Steve

	Calcutta: Ian Chappell believes Ricky Ponting is a better captain than predecessor Steve Waugh. 
    
	Ponting recently equalled Waughs record of leading his team to 16 consecutive Test wins, but Ian has no doubts about who he prefers as captain. 
    
	The former Australia captain feels Ponting is more pro-active of the two, trying forever to make things happen instead of waiting for the opposition to make mistakes. 
    
	Ponting holds the edge over Waugh, judged on those rare occasions in the past decade when the opposition has been able to dictate terms to Australia, Ian was quoted as saying in Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday. 
    
	Whereas Waugh ran out of attacking ideas quickly in those situations, Ponting works feverishly to dismiss opponents rather than waiting for them to make a mistake, he said. 
    
	Chappell, who led Australia in 30 Tests between 1971 and 1975 and is regarded as one of the games greatest ever leaders, said Waughs streak ended because he showed a lack of initiative when India recovered from the follow-on to win in Calcutta in 2001. 
    
	Despite having both Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath at his disposal, Waugh opted to play a waiting game as V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid piled on a 376-run partnership. 
    
	It was a fatal mistake. 
    
	Chappell said in similar situations, Ponting tries to provoke the opposition into making errors. 
    
	Ponting has improved his captaincy after making some mistakes in the losing 2005 Ashes series, while Waughs style never changed much. 
    
	Ponting has continued to grow and learn as a captain and while he only equalled Waughs victory record, he has surpassed him as a captain.

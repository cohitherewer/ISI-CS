The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Bourbon King out to settle scores
                                                                                                               Bourbon King out to settle scores 
            HONKY DORY      
	The Indian Turf Invitation Cup, which takes the centerstage at the Hyderabad racecourse on Sunday, promises a keen competition. Ten of the best thoroughbreds in the country have lined-up to take a tilt at the Invitation crown  the highest honour in the racing career of four-year-old horses. The Invitation Cup could be considered as the Nationals for the horses who represent the five regional turf clubs across the country.          
	However, among the frontline challengers, the S. Ganapathy-trained Bourbon King, has a score to settle. The Diffident-Queen Ann was unlucky to have encountered a troubled galloping room in the last months Indian Derby, at the Mahalaxmi ground, Mumbai. As a results of this, he failed to deliver the goods as a favourite. He was, however, the fastest finishing horse in the last furlong of the race while finishing an impressive fourth behind Hotstepper, the winner.           
	Bourbon King is expected to come back stronger this time, though the likes of Noble Princes, Regal Connections also have a similar stories to narrate.          
	The advantage, nevertheless, lies with Bourbon King who, not only had to encounter the rough passage but he also had to gallop eight-wide of the 19-horse Derby-field for a major part of the journey. Chances of such a fate in a 10-horse Invitation Cup-field are less.          
	All said and done, the King is expected to rule over Hotstepper who will be ridden this time by the best jockey in the business, Frankie Dettori.           
	Noble Prince, who was also seen finishing very fast in the Derby to place a bottled up third, may battle it out for the minor slot with the city champion galloper and the Derby winner, Regal Connection.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nowadays, we talk cricket in the board, not politics: Ranatunga
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nowadays, we talk cricket in the board, not politics: Ranatunga
  - The SLC chairman on the challenges being faced by him         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                    
	Colombo: Sri Lankas solitary World Cup-winning captain, Member of Parliament Arjuna Ranatunga, is now heading Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). On Saturday, he spoke to The Telegraph at the Sinhalese Sports Club, the boards HQ. His room, incidentally, has the best view at the ground.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q A lot of people, I understand, want you to effect changes quickly...         
	A But thats not possible... Of course, I and my team are trying to change what needs to be changed... Ive been fortunate in getting the help of two very bright men  Ashok Pathirage and Dian Gomes. Ashok is one of Sri Lankas youngest entrepreneurs and is now on the interim committee... Gomes was its member when I took over as chairman... Nowadays, we talk cricket in the board, not politics.         
	You also have a cricket committee, isnt it?         
	Aravinda (de Silva) is heading it... It has a number of other eminent former cricketers and I attend its meetings more as an observer... I make a contribution if I feel something needs to be added... Its nice that many former cricketers have got involved... (After a pause) Its compulsory now to play 75 per cent of the domestic matches if somebody wishes to do national duty... If thats not so, then how will the standard of our domestic cricket improve?         
	To ask a straight question, what have you set out to achieve?         
	I see myself as the custodian of cricket in Sri Lanka, not of any one section... My decision making is only being influenced by whats best for our cricket... Im not around to become popular, either with the players or with anybody else... If youre trying to do the right things, its almost certain you wont be a popular man... But Im comfortable with that... You know I talk straight... I wont say something to somebody in a one-on-one and present that differently before, say, the interim committee or the other board members.         
	Why did you opt out of the contracts-related discussions with the players representatives?         
	Well, I didnt want to say yes to everything... I didnt agree with some of the proposals... If the board has the money, the players will get the benefits. In the past, the players have got what they wanted and that contributed to the boards finances being in the red.         
	You took over at a time SLC was almost bankrupt. How come such a financial mess?         
	Because SLC has been the countrys biggest charitable organisation... There was an overdraft of $6 million when I moved into the chairmans room... There was also a loan of $3 million from the International Cricket Council (ICC)...         
	Whats your priority?         
	Cricket-wise, at the top is investing in schools cricket... Sadly, that has been neglected... For any sport to be strong, its foundation must first be solid... Another priority, obviously, is the financial restructuring... Spending on unwanted areas is out of the question and I wont be looking to appease people by signing cheques... The finances have to be protected... Well be making money from this tour  India and England are the biggest draws  and that has to be judiciously spent... The last TV deal was, if I may point out, done very unprofessionally and SLC lost a lot of revenue... Womens cricket is one more priority... It has been ignored.         
	Arent you looking at preparing for the 2011 World Cup?         
	Of course, yes, but I wont have a direct role in that... Ill only be asking the selectors to keep the event in mind... Time passes quickly and 2011 will be on us in no time... As the tournament will be held in the region, I think well have a very good chance of repeating 1996... Ive been very impressed with what the Indian selectors have done and Id like to compliment your selection committee chairman, (Dilip) Vengsarkar. You could lose a few tournaments, but the gains will be long term. Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma are so impressive. (After a pause) I dont want Murali (Muttiah Muralidharan) to play all the ODIs, I want him to play the major tournaments...         
	Do you find yourself under pressure?         
	The people who were after me when I was the captain have already begun to get after me... Its okay... I guess it comes with the territory... A lot of people were benefiting from the board, so its probably natural that they wouldnt be very pleased with me. My message to everybody has been I dont want to be the most popular chairman, and in trying to become one, ruining the board... I wasnt the most popular captain, but I did what was right and brought some glory for Sri Lanka.         
	Was it easier firing missiles from outside?         
	You know, even when I wasnt part of the board, I would get a lot of the papers from within and so was somewhat prepared for what to expect... However, having been in the chair for some months, I can say its easier running the country than running SLC... In fact, Ive told this even to our President (Mahinda Rajapaksa)...         
	There were whispers that, initially, you and the chief executive (Duleep Mendis, also a former captain) had differences...         
	No, no... Hes been cooperating... When I took charge I told him do the right things for our cricket... I also told him that if he found something wrong being done, then he should bring it to the notice of the interim committee.         
	Have you been acting as a sort of father-figure to the players?         
	If I see something wrong, then I do speak to the player... With money coming in, its important for them not to lose focus...Im there to guide them... In fact, I keep telling Mahela (Jayawardene) that his responsibilities as captain dont end on the field... Also that of a senior like Sanga (vice-captain Kumar Sangakkara).         
	How have the ICC meetings gone since youve taken over as SLC chairman?         
	Though Id been on the cricket committee, I was tense the first time I went to an Executive Board meeting... However, everybody made me feel comfortable... That Ive been a former captain has probably made the ICC look at me differently. I think I carried 10 kgs worth of files... Id never carried books of that weight in school! (After a pause) Im not one for wearing a suit and tie and, even If I have to, the jacket is usually off within five minutes.         
	Do you have a fixed term as SLC chairman?         
	No... Im going to be there for as long as I have the Presidents confidence... My hope is that when my innings gets over, Ill be succeeded by another former player... I dont get paid and havent been given an official car... Im in the chair because I love the game and there are days when I spend 12-14 hours at the board office.         
	The last question, Arjuna: Do you have a role model administrator?         
	Hes no more, Gamini Dissanayake. Hed played a major role in Sri Lanka getting Test status.

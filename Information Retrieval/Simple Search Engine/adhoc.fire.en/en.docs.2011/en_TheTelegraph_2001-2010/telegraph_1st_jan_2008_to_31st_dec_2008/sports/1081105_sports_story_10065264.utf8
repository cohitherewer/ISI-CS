The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hussey supports Aussie strategy
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hussey supports Aussie strategy
                  Michael Hussey in Nagpur on Tuesday                     
	Nagpur: Renowned for their aggressive brand of cricket, Australias defensive mindset in the Test series against India may have baffled most but middle-order batsman Michael Hussey Tuesday insisted that circumstances warranted a cautious approach and his team reacted accordingly.         
	Hussey, who has hit a century and two half centuries coming into this decider, did not agree with the views of some former players that the visitors have been ultra-defensive in their approach.         
	I dont think so. It all depended upon the situation. In Bangalore, we tried to press for a win.         
	In Mohali it was different as we were chasing a big score and in Delhi we were again chasing a big total, Hussey argued.         
	Im sure if the situation warrants, we will play attacking cricket here.         
	The 33-year-old middle-order batsman said the team has got used to playing against leggie Amit Mishra after floundering against his spin in Mohali.         
	In his debut Test, Mishra scalped seven wickets  five of them in the first innings  but Hussey believes his teammates now have a better idea about the young leggie ahead of the fourth and final Test beginning on November 6 at the newly built Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium here in Jamtha.         
	Its always difficult when you face a bowler for the first time. But we have got used to him after playing against him at Mohali and Delhi, he said.         
	Australia are down 0-1 in the series and desperately need a victory here to retain the Border-Gavaskar trophy, having won the previous rubber at home in the beginning of the year.         
	Hussey, however, said the team was not focussing on the outcome but on playing well so that the results follow.         
	We are not focussing on the result for now but on the process, he said, adding that the performance of the batsmen in the third drawn Test at Delhi would stand the team in good stead for the battle ahead.         
	It was not such a flat wicket in Delhi and to chase 600 and come very close took a lot of perseverance. (Australian captain) Ricky was very proud of our performance and it has given us lot of confidence (for the series decider), the Western Australian player said.         
	Hussey feels that the first session of play is likely to set the tone for the remainder of the crucial tie.         
	The first session of play in the Test match is most important whether batting or bowling. If we start it well we can take it from there and press for victory, said the left-handed batsman after practising at the old VCA stadium in the heart of the city.         
	Emotions would run high in the Indian camp here, following the quitting of Anil Kumble and the imminent retirement of another senior player Sourav Ganguly, however Hussey doesnt think it would affect the home teams focus.         
	I would hope so, but it would not happen as they are hardened professionals and would not allow these distractions to affect their play, Hussey said.         
	The left-hander could not say whether the Australians would include two spinners for the tie here by adding the uncapped off-spinner Jason Krejza, who had a long stint at the nets on Tuesday, to leggie Cameron White.         
	It will be decided by the captain and selectors after they have a look at the main stadium and pitch.         
	It would have been wonderful to have the feel by playing in the main stadium but thats not in our control and we have to take what we have been offered and make the best of it, he said.         
	Hussey said that Test cricket remained the ultimate for him despite the popularity of other formats of the game.         
	Test cricket tests a batsmans skill, technique mentally and physically. Test cricket is the most difficult form of the game to play. I dont agree that crowds no longer throng the Test venues, he emphasised.         
	Meanwhile, Hussey said he has taken the decision to play for Chennai Super Kings and not his state team Western Australia in the December 3-10 Champions Twenty20 League as he did not want to block younger players chances to play for WA.

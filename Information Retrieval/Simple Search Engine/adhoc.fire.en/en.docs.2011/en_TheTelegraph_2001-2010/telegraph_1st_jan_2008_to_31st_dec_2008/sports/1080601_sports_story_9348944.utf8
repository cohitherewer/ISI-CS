                                                                                                                                                                                                     KPS Gill pulls out team from jr meet
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The IOA appointed adhoc committee on hockey was caught on the wrong foot after deposed IHF president KPS Gill got the junior national team scrapped from the four-nation tournament in Poland.         
	The organisers of the under-21 tournament (June 11 to 15) have now decided to include Austria in place of India.         
	According to IOA sources, Gill wrote a letter to the organisers on the IHF letter-head, after the body was suspended,saying the team will not participate in the tournament.         
	The organisers of the Poland tournament were ignorant about IHFs suspension and accepted the letter from Gill as official.         
	The adhoc committee, with IOA president Suresh Kalmadi as chairman, was completely unaware of the developments and continued to run the camp for the meet in Sonepat under coach A.K. Bansal.         
	IOA sources said that the ad hoc committee only came to know about Gills letter to the tournament committee a few days ago and made some futile attempts to get India back in the tournament.         
	While there is no doubt that Gill acted cheaply, the ad hoc committee should also be pulled up for their lacklustre attitude, said a source in the IOA. They should have been more careful.         
	The ad hoc committee, sources said, finally approached the international hockey federation (FIH) president Els van Breda Vriesman of the Netherlands to reverse the decision of the tournament organisers in Poland. The FIH president tried her best but couldnt do much, sources said.

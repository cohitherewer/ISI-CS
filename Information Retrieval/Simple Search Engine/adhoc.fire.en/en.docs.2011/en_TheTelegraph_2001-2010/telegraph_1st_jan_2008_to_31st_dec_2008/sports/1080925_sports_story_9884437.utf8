The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo scores once in United victory
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ronaldo scores once in United victory
  - Carlos Vela nets hattrick as Arsenal thrash Sheffield United 6-0 
          
	London: Arsenals future looks to be in safe hands after a largely teenage side produced a sparkling display to thrash Championship (second division) side Sheffield United 6-0 in the third round of the League Cup on Tuesday.         
	Nineteen-year-old Mexico striker Carlos Alberto Vela led the way with a hattrick, while 16-year-old Jack Wilshere ran the midfield in a performance that must have left manager Arsene Wenger purring.         
	Manchester United needed two late goals to beat 10-man Middlesbrough 3-1 at Old Trafford while Liverpool, showing 11 changes from the team who drew with Stoke City at the weekend, beat League One (third division) side Crewe 2-1 at Anfield.         
	Gianfranco Zola, who got off to a winning start in his new role as manager of West Ham United at the weekend, tasted defeat on Tuesday when a Hayden Mullins own goal gave Watford victory at Vicarage Road, while Fulham were also on the wrong end of an upset when they lost 1-0 at Burnley.         
	Sunderland and Stoke both needed penalty shoot-outs to get past third division Northampton and second division Reading respectively.         
	Wengers policy of playing youth players in the League Cup took Arsenal to the semi-finals last season and he had already said he intended to stick with it this year.         
	Aside from 23-year-old goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianksi, Tuesdays team had an average age of 19 and the youngsters rewarded their managers faith by tearing United apart. Nicklas Bendtner, one of the most experienced players in the team at the age of 20, got the first two goals, both after sweeping passing moves.         
	Velas treble included an exquisite chip that delighted the Emirates crowd while Wilshere capped a fine individual display byfiring in the fifth.         
	It was a great Arsenal performance. Im very happy and very proud tonight, Wenger told a television channel.         
	You could see that Vela is a clinical finisher.Cristiano Ronaldo marked his first start of the season by heading Manchester United into the lead at Old Trafford but Adam Johnson nodded an equaliser after 56 minutes.         
	Middlesbrough had Emanuel Pogatetz red carded for a bad foul on Brazilian midfielder Rodrigo Possebon after 72 minutes and some poor defending then opened the door for Ryan Giggs and Nani to secure Uniteds progress. The studs-up challenge from the Middlesbrough captain saw Possebon requiring oxygen on field before he was taken off. Pogatetz later vowed to apologise saying, I am going to speak to Rodrigo by telephone and I will apologise for hurting him. I hope that he will make a quick recovery and that he will not be out for long.         
	On Wednesday holders Tottenham Hotspur, currently bottom of the Premier League, visit struggling Newcastle United who are still without a manager and a club owner, while 2008 runners-up Chelsea are Portsmouth.

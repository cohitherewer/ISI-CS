	No contract for Malinga  Colombo: Lasith Malinga, who is currently recovering from an injury, has not been given a central contract by Sri Lanka Cricket. The fiery pacer had been a permanent member of the Lanka team before his injury. The SLC rsquo;s move has come as a big surprise and even coach Trevor Bayliss expressed surprise at the move.  Faisal let off   Karachi: Pakistan Test batsman Faisal Iqbal sighed with relief on Saturday after the cricket board let him off with a warning for playing in a Twenty20 festival tournament alongside players of the rebel ICL.  The PCB issued a showcause notice to Faisal warning him to be careful in future and avoid taking part in any event without clearance from the board.  The board had issued the notice to Faisal after he played in the event in May that also featured several ICL players. ldquo;His matter was discussed at the meeting of the ICC and it was decided to let him off this time with a strong warning, rdquo; an official said.  Gul fitness   Karachi: Fitness concern looms large on Pakistan team as many players are still unsure of making the squad for next month rsquo;s Champions Trophy and the latest to join the list is pacer Umar Gul.  Gul, who was recuperating from a rib cartilage injury during the Asia cup in late June, was unable to take part in the second trial match played in Multan on Saturday.
  ldquo;He has not played today and we are not sure about his fitness, rdquo; chief selector, Salahuddin Ahmed said. The national selectors are due to finalise the Champions Trophy squad by Tuesday and the two trial matches are basically being held to assess the fitness of some players including fast bowler, Shoaib Akhtar and Gul.  Lawson wish  Karachi: Even as the PCB awaits a response from New Zealand cricket on their plans of touring Pakistan later this month, national coach Geoff Lawson says he would like to see the Black Caps here as it would give his team valuable exposure before next month rsquo;s Champions Trophy.

	Epsom: A field of 17 will contest Saturdays Vodafone Derby here for the race worth 1,413,500. The winner takes home just over 800,000. Ante-post favourite Casual Conquest, trained by Dermot Weld, will be hoping to repay the 75,000 that connections paid to add the horse into the race at Mondays confirmation stage.          
	Aidan Brien has five runners in the field -- Frozen Fire, King Of Rome, Alessandro Volta, Bashkirov and Washington Irving  while Sir Michael Stoute has accepted to run a Tartan Bearer, Tajaaweed and Doctor Fremantle. Luca Cumani is hoping for a third win in the race with Curtain Call. Cumani triumphed with Kahyasi in 1988 and then with High-Rise 10 years later and this years challenger, who will be ridden by Jamie Spencer, is well fancied after his victory last time out at Nottingham.          
	The seven-strong Irish contingent includes the 2,000 Guineas runner-up New Approach, who was the subject of much discussion after trainer Jim Bolger made a late decision to run the horse at Epsom. Bolger had indicated in April that the ante-post favourite at that time would not be prepared for the Classic.          
	Last years winning trainer Peter Chapple-Hyam hopes that Bouguereau can give him back-to-back wins in the race. Authorized (L. Dettori-up) had won last years Derby. Henry Cecils Kandahar Run and Godolphins Rio De La Plata, who will be ridden by Frankie Dettori,, will also go for the Derby glory.          
	Aidan Briens retained jockey Johnny Murtagh, who had the choice of the Ballydoyle handlers five contenders, opted for King Of Rome and believes he has a good chance of claiming his fourth win in the race.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Satyajit Chatterjee is happy with the teams performance against Bayern Munich despite the 0-3 drubbing at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday.         
	The former midfielder, who had to work with a bunch of youngsters in the absence of the national team players, felt his team could have scored on a couple of occasions.         
	Out of the three goals we conceded, two were let in by the defence, Chatterjee said. We missed some easy chances. Our boys were inexperienced and the media, too, put them under immense pressure. There was speculation in the media that we might lose by a big margin. Such things do affect the morale of the team. Yet, my boys did a splendid job. I am proud of them.         
	Asked on the incident when Bayern Munichs Breno and Branco Cardozo were given marching orders by the referee, the Bagan coach blamed the visitors. They were commuting fouls repeatedly. Finally, Branco reacted. It was unfortunate but Cardozo was provoked.

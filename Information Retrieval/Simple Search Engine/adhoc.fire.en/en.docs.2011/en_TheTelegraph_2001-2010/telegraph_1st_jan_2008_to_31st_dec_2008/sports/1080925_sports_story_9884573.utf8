            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Fighting Star scored an authoritative victory, on Wednesday, in the 1,200m Prudential Cup. The Darius Byramji-trained horse was taken to the front by jockey C. Alford right after the field was dispatched by the starter. The 2-1 favourite was only two lengths ahead in the first half of the journey but grew stronger in the home-stretch to end up a six-length winner. Over The Limit chased Fighting Star all the time but failed badly after taking the home turn very wide. Trainers Vikash Jaiswal and Robin Corner scored a double apiece on the day.

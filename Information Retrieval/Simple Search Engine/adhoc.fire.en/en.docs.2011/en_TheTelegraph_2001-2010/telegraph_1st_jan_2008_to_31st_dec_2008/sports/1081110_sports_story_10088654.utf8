The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eto strikes four in Barcelona goal rush
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Eto strikes four in Barcelona goal rush
                      
	Madrid: Samuel Eto helped Barcelona stay top of the Primera Liga by scoring four first-half goals as the leaders crushed Valladolid 6-0 at the Nou Camp on Saturday.         
	The striker took his league tally for the season to 13 and matched Gonzalo Higuains earlier heroics for Real Madrid when the Argentine striker scored all four goals as they came back with 10 men to beat promoted Malaga 4-3 at the Bernabeu.         
	Barcelonas eighth straight league win gives them 25 points from 10 games, two ahead of champions Real in second. Third-placed Villarreal have 21 points.         
	Eto raced through to beat two defenders and open the scoring for Barcelona in the 12th minute before doubling their lead on the half-hour with a volley after a wonderful flowing move.         
	He picked up Lionel Messis pass to round the keeper for the third in the 42nd and slotted home the fourth two minutes later after the Argentina forwards surging run was blocked and the ball broke free for the Cameroon forward.         
	Eidur Gudjohnsen netted a delicate chip in the 71st and a sublime passing move ended with Aleksandr Hleb squaring for Frances Thierry Henry to stab home the sixth near the end.         
	While Barcelonas victory was a one-sided affair full of intricate passing moves, Reals win owed more to their gritty fighting spirit as they narrowly avoided making it four games without a victory in all competitions.         
	The injury-hit side were under pressure to appease the Bernabeu faithful who had whistled at the team during Wednesdays 0-2 Champions League defeat at home to Juventus.         
	They got off to a bad start when Malagas Portuguese midfielder Eliseu dribbled off the wing past two defenders. When his pull-back was fired against the post he put away the rebound.         
	The home team responded quickly with Higuain netting after Francesc Arnau could only parry Marcelos shot but a low cross from Duda caught Real defender Gabriel Heinze flat-footed in the 18th minute leaving Malaga striker Nabil Baha free to score.         
	Higuain came to the rescue from the penalty spot after a handball on the edge of the area, but Real were reduced to 10 men when defender Sergio Ramos stepped on Eliseus chest after a challenge.         
	In Serie A action, a stoppage-time own goal from Cicinho gave third-from-bottom Bologna a 1-1 home draw against AS Roma in Sinisa Mihajlovics first game in charge on Saturday.         
	The Brazilian defenders diving header cancelled out Francesco Tottis 68th-minute strike.

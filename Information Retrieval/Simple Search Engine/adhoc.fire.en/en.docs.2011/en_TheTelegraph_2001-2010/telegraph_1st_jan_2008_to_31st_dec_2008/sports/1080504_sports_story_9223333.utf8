The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Grant   plans Chelsea future
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Grant   plans Chelsea future

	The silence at the top of the club may remain deafening, yet Avram Grant felt sufficiently emboldened to speak with confidence about his Chelsea future.         
	Owner Roman Abramovich was absent from Chelseas Champions League semi-final victory against Liverpool on Wednesday, but has since talked with Grant to relay his pleasure and congratulations at one of the finest achievements in the clubs history.         
	We are in contact, and hes happy, Grant said. The relationship is good. Everything will be ok.         
	Having guided Chelsea to the brink of winning both the Premier League and European Cup, all the uncertainty about Grants future may seem perverse. However, it was only last month that chairman Bruce Buck refused to say whether he would be manager next season. Against that, chief executive Peter Kenyon has said that Grants four-year contract is not contingent on winning trophies.         
	Whatever the private conversations, Grant appears genuinely comfortable with the situation. Do I look worried? he said. No. About my personal life, I dont know what Im doing tomorrow. Professionally, I know what Chelsea need to do tomorrow, a week from now or two years from now.         
	For now, the momentum is certainly with Grant and the turning point may well prove to be the 2-1 win against Arsenal at the end of March. Chelsea had trailed 0-1 and Grant answered the chants from his own fans of You dont know what youre doing with match-winning substitutions.         
	Victories against Manchester United and Liverpool have followed and, suddenly, genuine acceptance appears possible.         
	I think it was a process here, Grant said. Every change, not just in football, takes time. Even if you take a big business and make a big change, sometimes you need a while to get respect. I think the fans showed us respect. They were our 12th man. I think the relationship is good now.         
	All the signs, certainly, suggest that Chelsea have reached optimum form at the perfect time. Key players like John Terry, Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard and Michael Ballack are free of injury and, having missed phases of the season, are fresh.         
	We were in a process, developing our game, Grant said. This week, in the true moment against two great clubs and two great managers, weve showed that we can win.         
	I always like to think that the best week hasnt come yet. The 30th April is a historic day at Chelsea now. It was a big, big step getting to the Champions League final.         
	The first ambition was to be in the final of the Champions League, especially in Moscow, which means so much for the owner. We did that. With more food, you have more appetite.         
	After success on the European stage, attention now turns to the Premier League. Grant had the experience of winning the league title in Israel after overcoming a deficit of eight points and believes that Manchester United will have been surprised by their progress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anil was always a realist: Wright
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anil was always a realist: Wright
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Calcutta: Always a realist... A fierce competitor who never took anything for granted, least of all his place in the team...         
	Thats how former India coach John Wright saluted Anil Kumble on Sunday evening, when The Telegraph got through to him in Christchurch.         
	He added: Im sure Anil wouldve liked to retire at the end of the series, but the (left hand) injury obviously hastened the decision... In the circumstances, he has timed it well...         
	Its with a huge amount of fondness that I look back on my own association with Anil... He was dignified, even when we had to play one spinner and Harbhajan (Singh) got the nod... Always sporting... But, then, Anil was an excellent ambassador for India and the game...         
	According to Wright, who is now with New Zealand Cricket, his relationship with Kumble was of one between equals. As he put it: I didnt have to be a coach with him, never... Indeed, we had enormous respect for each other during the four-and-a-half years that I was the coach.         
	One of the first to publicly assert (through these columns, incidentally) that Kumble had the qualities to captain India, Wright said: My view is that Anil shouldve got the job much earlier (rather than last November, in Tests), but such things happen... Whats nice is that he finally got the captaincy and quit while holding that job...         
	Wright signed off by wishing Kumble the very best in whatever he now chooses to do. As you know, Anils a gifted individual...         
	One cant disagree.

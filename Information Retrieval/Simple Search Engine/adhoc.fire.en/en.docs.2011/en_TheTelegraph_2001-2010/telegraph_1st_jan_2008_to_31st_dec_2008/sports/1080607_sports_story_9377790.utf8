	Nottingham: James Anderson took his Test best bowling figures of six for 42 to give England the upper hand on the second day of the third Test against New Zealand on Friday.         
	New Zealand was 96-6 at stumps on the second day in reply to Englands 364.         
	Anderson, who earlier in the day had scored his highest Test batting score of 28, destroyed New Zealand with his accurate swing bowling under darkening skies at Trent Bridge.         
	Bad light shortened play by an hour. New Zealand trail Englands first innings total by 268 and could struggle to prevent the hosts from claiming a 2-0 series win in this final Test. The Black Caps need 69 more runs to avoid the follow on. (AP)

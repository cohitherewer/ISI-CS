                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal ends tied 22
                      
	Glenview: A bogey-free back nine helped Arjun Atwal recover from an erratic front nine and the Orlando-based Indian turned in a one-under 71 in the final round to sign off tied 22 in the Nationwide Tours Bank of America Open.         
	American Kris Blanks fired a four-under 68 in the final round to lift the title with a 272. He was followed a stroke behind by his compatriot Bob May (64).         
	Meanwhile in Dublin, Ohio, the Swede of Indian origin Daniel Chopra returned a second successive four-over 76 to sign off a disappointing tied 53rd in the Memorial Tournament.

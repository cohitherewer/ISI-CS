	London: Vicente del Bosque the new Spanish head coach started off well as his team won 3-0 in Denmark while Fabio Capellos England were held to a 2-2 home draw by Czech Republic in World Cup warm-ups on Wednesday.         
	At Wembley, substitute Joe Cole saved England from defeat against the Czechs by equalising two minutes into stoppage time.         
	Italy were grateful for an own goal by Ramazan Ozcan as they salvaged a 2-2 draw with Austria in the French city of Nice in their first match back under the command of 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi.         
	Lippi was by no means the only coach making a fresh start, with Czech Karel Brueckner now at the helm in Austria and Carlos Queiroz back with his home country Portugal, who crushed Faroe Islands 5-0 at Aveiro. New Czech coach Petr Rada will be pleased with his debut at Wembley while former Bayern Munich boss Ottmar Hitzfeld celebrated his Switzerland start with a 4-1 win over Cyprus.         
	Argentine Hector Cuper would also have been satisfied with his Georgia team after their 2-1 win over Wales in Swansea.         
	Bert van Marwijk watched Robin van Persie put his Dutch side ahead in Moscow before Russia equalised with a penalty from Konstantin Zyryanov.         
	Germany beat Belgium 2-0 in Nuremberg while winger Sidney Govou struck twice in Frances 3-2 victory in Sweden.         
	Among the best performances in Wednesdays warm-ups were the two goals from midfielder Xabi Alonso in Spains victory and Dimitar Berbatovs double for Bulgaria in a 2-1 win in Bosnia.         
	Several South American teams were also in action as they prepared for World Cup qualifiers, with Uruguay coming from behind to beat Japan 3-1 in Sapporo.         
	Leaders Paraguay conceded a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Saudi Arabia in Nyon, Switzerland while second-placed Argentina were held 0-0 by Belarus in Minsk.         
	There was a shock in Africa as Nations Cup holders Egypt crashed to a 0-4 defeat by Sudan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney brace in Englands high five
                                                                                                                                                                                             Rooney brace in Englands high five
                  Englands Rio Ferdinand celebrates his goal against Kazakhstan with Wes Brown (top) at Wembley on Saturday                     
	Wembley: Wayne Rooney scored twice Saturday to help England overcome a shaky performance and beat Kazakhstan 5-1 in World Cup qualifying.         
	England endured a frustrating first half in coach Fabio Capellos first competitive match at Wembley and almost fell behind at the start of the second before Rio Ferdinand, who was captain in place of injured John Terry, headed in a 52nd-minute corner.         
	Kazakhstan defender Alexandr Kuchma, under pressure from Rooney, headed into his own net in the 63rd before a bad pass by Ashley Cole allowed Zhambyl Kukeyev to make it 2-1.         
	But Rooney added two late goals and substitute Jermain Defoe got one in the 90th.         
	Although the performance was far below the 4-1 win at Croatia last month, England still has maximum points from its first three qualifying matches ahead of Wednesdays game at Belarus.         
	England did produce some bright moments in the opening exchanges, most notably through Theo Walcott. However, their first two goals came from set pieces  and only then after Capello had abandoned an adventurous 4-3-3 formation in favour of a standard 4-4-2.         
	Kazakhstan striker Tanat Nusserbayev had just shot over Englands bar with only goalkeeper David James to beat when Ferdinand  who had looked composed throughout compared to Terrys replacement, Matthew Upson  headed in the opening goal to relieved cheers.         
	Teams         
	England: David James, Wes Brown, Rio Ferdinand, Matthew Upson, Ashley Cole, Gareth Barry (Shaun Wright-Phillips 46), Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Theo Walcott (David Beckham 79); Emile Heskey, Wayne Rooney (Jermain Defoe 87).

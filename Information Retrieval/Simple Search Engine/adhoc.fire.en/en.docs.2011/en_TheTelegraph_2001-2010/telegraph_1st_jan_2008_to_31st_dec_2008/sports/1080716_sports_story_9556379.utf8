	Budapest: Hungarys two-time Olympic canoe champion Gyorgy Kolonics died on Tuesday, most likely due to heart failure, during a practice session for the Beijing Games, the Hungarian Kayak-Canoe Federation said.         
	Kolonics, 36, who won Olympic gold medals in 1996 and 2000 and bronze medals in 1996 and 2004, fell unconscious and could not be resuscitated, Etele Barath, the federations president told state news agency.         
	Kolonics was set to compete in Beijing, his fifth Olympics, in the 500 metres and 1,000 metres double events with Gyorgy Kozmann.         
	In an international career spanning over 16 years, Kolonics won 15 world championship titles. He rose to national prominence in Hungary after taking the 500 metre doubles title in Atlanta with teammate Csaba Horvath.

	 Deportation chances increase  
	Karachi: Detained Pakistani pacer Mohammed Asif is likely to be deported back home after the attorney general in Dubai gives a final verdict on the bowler by Monday.   
	The attorney general is scheduled to hear the prosecutions findings into the case on Sunday and the feelers we have got is that he will pass an order to deport Asif by Monday, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) source said.         
	 Although PCB officials on Friday confirmed that authorities in Dubai had extended Asifs detention to June 22, but they said this was purely because of legal requirements and law of the land. The source said authorities had got Asifs detention extended since the law in Dubai bars authorities from detaining a suspect for more then 14 days and an extension was needed in case more investigations had to carried out.           
	Shoaib matter  
	 Karachi: The legal counsel of the PCB is confident that the appellate tribunal, hearing the appeal of banned fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar will deliver its verdict on Saturday. The tribunal is due to meet and deliberate in Lahore on Saturday as counsels for the board and the beleaguered paceman concluded their arguments last week. The arguments have been completed and no fresh evidence or documentation has come from either side.Hopefully the tribunal can reach a decision on Saturday, Tafazzul Rizvi said on Friday. The board for its part will accept any decision, he added.           
	Gilly awestruck  
	 Melbourne: Retired Australian stumper Adam Gilchrist is still awestruck by the glitz and glamour of the inaugural Indian Premier League and feels it outshone even the Sydney Olympic Games, but Australia captisn Ricky Ponting fears the easy moolah in IPL might just lure next generation cricketers away from national duty. . It was quite overwhelming to see an event capture the attention and mindset and imagination of a country quite like it, Gilchrist said. The only thing I can think of that was comparable was maybe the Olympics when they were in Sydney.           
	Aussie coach  
	 Melbourne: Performance analyst of the Australian mens cricket team, Richard McInnes has been appointed as the new head coach of the national women team, a Cricket Australia statement said on Friday.           
	Curator meet  
	 New Delhi: A Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) workshop-cum-seminar on pitch preparation and maintenance of outfields stressed on the need for having better curators and modern ground equipment for domestic tournaments.           
	Ticket scam  
	 Panaji: A lower court in Goa has framed criminal charges against BCCI vice president and states law minister Dayanand Narvekar in connection with the fake ticket scam reported during a 2001 India-Australia one day International.

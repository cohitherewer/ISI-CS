                                                                                                                                                                                           THE HOTTEST ONES...
    - The 10 INTERNATIONAL STARS expected to make it big                           
	USAIN BOLT         
	Usain Bolt (born August 21, 1986) is a Jamaican sprinter, and the current world record holder in the 100m (9.72s), world junior record holder in the 200m (19.93s), and Jamaican record holder in the 200m (19.67s). His name and achievements in sprinting have earned him the media nickname The Lightning Bolt. In 2004, Bolt ran the 200m in 19.93 seconds, becoming the first junior to break the 20-second mark, breaking Lorenzo Daniels world junior record. On May 3, 2008, Bolt ran the 100m in 9.76s (+1.8 m/s) at the Jamaica Invitational, then the second fastest legal performance in the history of the event, behind compatriot Asafa Powell. Later that month, on May 31, 2008, Bolt ran 9.72 (+1.7 m/s), establishing a world record in the 100m at the Reebok Grand Prix in New York, breaking the 9.74-second record of Powell.         
	With a 200m personal best of 19.67 this season, an Olympic sprint double could now be in his sights. The 100m final against Powell and double world champion Tyson Gay would be one of the highlights of the Games.               
	TYSON GAY         
	Tyson Gay (born August 9, 1982) is an American sprinter who won gold medals at the 100m, 200m and 4x100m at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics in Osaka, Japan. Gay served notice in 2006 that he is one of the worlds finest sprinters in dramatically lowering his personal bests in both the 100 and 200m.         
	In 2007, Gay established himself as the worlds dominant sprinter in winning gold medals in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay at the World Outdoor Championships. Gay went on to win the 100m at the 2008 Olympic Trials in 9.68s, the fastest time in history ever posted under any conditions. He is expected to compete at the Olympic Games in Beijing in the 100m and 4x100m relays.               
	YELENA ISINBAYEVA         
	Yelena Isinbayeva (born June 3, 1982 in Volgograd) is a Russian pole vaulter. She won the 2004 Olympic gold with a world record (then 4.91m), was elected Female Athlete of the Year by the IAAF twice (2004 and 2005), and Sportswoman of the Year by Laureus. On July 22, 2005, she became the first female pole-vaulter to clear the barrier of 5.00m. At 26, she has already been a eight-time major champion (Olympic, World outdoor and indoor champion and European outdoor and indoor champion). Setting 23 world records (13 outdoor and 10 indoor), staying virtually unbeaten since the Games of 2004, she is one of the most successful athletes of her generation.               
	GUO JINGJING         
	Guo Jingjing (born October 15, 1981) is a female diver from the Peoples Republic of China. Guo represented China at the 2004 Athens Olympics, earning a gold medal in the 3m womens synchronised springboard along with Wu Minxia before finally winning her first individual Olympic gold in the 3m springboard.         
	She is the leading member of the Chinese national womens diving team after Fu Mingxia.         
	She announced on November 23, 2006 that she would retire following the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.         
	When she dared spend time on endorsements after her Athens double, she was reprimanded by sports bureaucrats.               
	SHAWN JOHNSON         
	Shawn Johnson (born January 19, 1992) is an American gymnast. She is the 2007 World All-Around Champion and the 2007 and 2008 US All-Around Champion. She is a member of the US 2008 Olympic womens gymnastics team. Shawn has had a great year so far in 2008. She is bound for Beijing after coming first at the Olympic trials in June. In May, Shawn was named the national champion for the second year in a row at the 2008 Visa National Championships. She also won the All-Around at a meet in Jesolo, Italy, competing against gymnasts from Italy, Spain and Poland.         
	At 16, she is perhaps the best gymnast in the world  a compact, powerful package who is just as at home on the beam and bars as she is in the vault and floor events.               
	YAO MING         
	Yao Ming (born September 12, 1980) is a Chinese professional basketball player who plays for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is currently the tallest player in the NBA, at 7 feet 6 inches.         
	Yao started playing for the Shanghai Sharks as a teenager, and played on their senior team for five years in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), winning a championship in his final year.         
	Beijing will be Yaos third Olympic Games, though China have never fared better than eighth place. His countrys opening match against the US on August 10 is predicted to break Olympic TV viewing records.               
	MICHAEL PHELPS         
	Michael Phelps (born June 30, 1985 in Baltimore, Maryland) is an American swimmer holding World Records in several events. Phelps won eight medals at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, six of which were gold, which tied the record for medals at a single Olympics, a record that had been held by Alexander Dityatin since 1980. Phelpss international titles, along with his various world records, have resulted in his being named World Swimmer of the Year in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007.         
	The biggest challenge Michael Phelps, 23, will face in Beijing will be the clock. In Beijing, he has a chance to surpass Mark Spitzs record of seven gold medals at a single Games.               
	NATALIE DU TOIT         
	Natalie du Toit (born January 29, 1984) is a South African swimmer. She is best known for the gold medals she won at the 2004 Paralympic Games as well as the Commonwealth Games. The womens 10km open-water swimming competition is certain to be an emotional experience for the 24-year-old, who wept openly when she qualified at the World Championships in Seville in May. After losing her left leg below the knee in a motorcycle accident seven years ago, Du Toit will make history by becoming the first female amputee to compete at the Olympics. In 2004, her courage and achievements were acknowledged with a nomination for the Laureus World Sportsperson of the Year 2004 with Disability Award.               
	DARA TORRES         
	Dara Grace Torres (born April 15, 1967) is an American swimmer. She will be the first swimmer from the US to compete in five Olympics: 1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2008. She will compete in the Beijing Olympic Games in the 50m freestyle, 4x100 medley relay, and 4x100 freestyle relay. She has won nine Olympic medals, including four golds, and won five medals alone in Sydney in 2000.         
	A seven-year hiatus from elite level training didnt intimidate Torres from coming back; it just made her hungrier. She had been swimming in Masters events after retiring in 2000. It was the time she swam in the 50m at the Masters World Championships of August that earned her a spot at the Olympic trials this July.               
	LIU XIANG         
	Liu Xiang (born July 13, 1983 in Shanghai) is a 110m hurdler. Liu is an Olympic gold medallist and World Champion. His 2004 Olympic gold medal was Chinas first in a mens track and field event. He is the first Chinese athlete to achieve the triple crown of athletics (world record holder, world champion and Olympic champion) concurrently.         
	Liu is expected to do a Cathy Freeman and triumph on home soil. If shouldering the expectations of the worlds most populous nation were not enough, Liu, the reigning world champion, also has some serious competition in the shape of Cuban Dayron Robles, who shaved 0.01s off his world record when he ran 12.87 in June.         
	A recent Internet poll found that the Chinas No. 1 Olympic wish is for Liu to win gold. The Chinese sports ministry, which has three doctors dedicated to Lius well-being, apparently holds similarly high hopes. Officials told us if Liu could not win a gold medal in Beijing, all of his previous achievements would become meaningless, said Sun Haiping, Lius coach. Just how important is Liu? Well, an insurance company has valued his legs at $13.5 million.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | THE VIJAY MALLYA STATEMENT
                                                                                                                                                                                                     THE VIJAY MALLYA STATEMENT
                                VIJAY MALLYA      
	There has been considerable speculation on current events surrounding the Royal Challengers cricket team including their performance.         
	I would like to clarify that I continue to have faith and confidence in all my players led by captain Rahul Dravid and in Martin Crowe, chief cricketing officer and his team.         
	My choice of Brijesh Patel as CEO was largely motivated by the fact that he is an accomplished cricketer himself from Karnataka and understands local conditions with the depth that is required.         
	The addition of Brijesh Patel to lead the management of Royal Challengers will strengthen the team considerably and will also have a positive influence on the selection and future development of local Karnataka cricketers who aspire to play in the IPL in future.         
	While Brijesh Patel is better equipped to comment upon the composition of the Royal Challengers squad and support staff, I am fully supportive of Venkatesh Prasad as bowling coach after he excelled himself with the Indian team recently in Australia.         
	Calcutta is where I was born and bred and I still consider myself to be a parar chele. Tomorrows match, therefore, is going to be an emotional one for me personally.

                                                   Pawar: No role in players auction
                      
	Shillong: Sharad Pawar on Friday described himself as a trouble-shooter in the BCCI, saying he did not like poking his nose into every affair of the cricket administration.         
	I have appointed proper experts to handle the affairs of the BCCI. The experts in the field of cricket are more equipped to handle such matters, Pawar said.         
	I have set guidelines for them. I have confidence that they can deliver. And in case of any problem, I am always there as a trouble-shooter, the BCCI president said in reply to a query at a news conference here on his absence at the much-hyped players auction in Mumbai on Wednesday during the Indian Premier Leagues bidding process.         
	Referring to IPL chairman Lalit Modi and other cricketers like Sunil Gavaskar who are on the IPL panel, Pawar said: I had no role in the IPL auction. There are also eminent businessmen on the IPL panel to assist the cricketing experts in the exercise.         
	My working style is different. I believe in decentralisation. I head many organisations, but the actual executioners are the experts in the particular field. (PTI)

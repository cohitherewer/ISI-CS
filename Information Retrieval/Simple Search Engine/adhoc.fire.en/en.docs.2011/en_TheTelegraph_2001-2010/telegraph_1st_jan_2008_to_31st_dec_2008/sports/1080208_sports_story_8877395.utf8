The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Laxman lauds   Kumble
                                                Laxman lauds   Kumble
                            
	New Delhi: V.V.S. Laxman may have been branded as a Test specialist but the stylish middle-order batsman has not yet given up hope of playing one-dayers for India again.         
	Laxman said it was disappointing not to be a part of the one-day team for the tri-series in Australia. Reason given by selectors for me being out of the one day team is not my batting, but my fielding. Though I am not the quickest fielder, but I am a safe fielder, Laxman said. Laxman also praised the captaincy of Anil Kumble.         
	Kumble has handled the team very well. Hes the senior most member of the team after Sachin and everyone respects him. So the way he handled us was not surprising considering his vast experience and knowledge about the game, he observed.

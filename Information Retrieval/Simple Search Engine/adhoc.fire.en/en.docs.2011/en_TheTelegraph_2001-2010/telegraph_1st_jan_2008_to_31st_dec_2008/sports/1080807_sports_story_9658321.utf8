            A CORRESPONDENT                                Paddy Upton      
	Colombo: In head coach Gary Kirstens absence, Paddy Upton, Indias mental conditioning coach, has taken over the responsibilities. Upton stressed on the co-ordination of the expertise thats already in the team.         
	Following are excerpts:         
	On Indias preparation for the third Test         
	All players have been aware of their responsibility, of their roles in the team. Not only the players but also the management. Its a case of doing just what we have always been doing. Each person knows their role very well. Theres a lot of expertise within the team. There are five guys who have captained India, so it will just be a case of co-ordinating that expertise thats already in the team.         
	If the heat is going to be a problem         
	The players are used to playing in this kind of heat. They are all very good at managing themselves, so we are not concerned about it at all. The heats the same for both teams and we are comfortable.         
	Whether the toss is going to be important         
	Whether we win or we lose the toss, our preparation has been the same. We plan and strategise around what must happen should we win, should we bat first or should we bowl first. We are happy that we can take the consideration of the toss out of the picture, we are prepared for it.         
	On the importance of the match         
	The key is to prepare as well as possible for every single game, every game is critical in Test cricket. We are sitting at a really critical point now, one-all with one to play. Everyone knows how important it is. They dont need too many reminders but we remind them anyway.         
	If there is any different approach to this game         
	Its a different game, its a different wicket. Its a different part in the series. But in terms of preparation, its the same. The strategy will change according to these conditions but otherwise everything is pretty much the same.         
	On the comeback victory in the second Test         
	We can take a lot of heart from it. Its exciting. We really do have a strong batting line-up. And theres some due runs from some batsmen. Really, its a team game of a whole lot of individuals. So individually, each person needs to take some responsibility to do something to contribute to the win.

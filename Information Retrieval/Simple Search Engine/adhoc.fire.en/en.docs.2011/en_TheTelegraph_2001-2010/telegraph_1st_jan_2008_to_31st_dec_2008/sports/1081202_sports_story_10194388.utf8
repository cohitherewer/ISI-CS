	New Delhi: Indian Olympic Association on Monday assured stringent security measures will be in place for the 2010 Commonwealth Games to be held here.         
	They said the security arrangements would be like the ones that were in place at the Beijing Olympics.         
	In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, IOA general secretary Randhir Singh said security was not a concern for the high-profile event.         
	The Mumbai attacks are sad but as far as Commonwealth Games are concerned, high-level security has been planned already, he said.         
	There will be no compromise on the security issue as we are duty-bound to provide tight security. The security will be like the Beijing Olympics, added Randhir. (PTI)

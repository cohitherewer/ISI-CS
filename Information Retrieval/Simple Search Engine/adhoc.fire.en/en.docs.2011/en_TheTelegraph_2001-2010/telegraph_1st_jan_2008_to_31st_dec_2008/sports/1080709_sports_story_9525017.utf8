	EXPLOITS         
	Father of the hammer-throwing event         
	Despite the sour taste in the mouths of those who experienced or participated in the first Olympics of the 20th century, the Paris Games did produce some unforgettable moments.         
	It took a man originally from County Limerick in Ireland to provide the shine it sorely lacked. In doing so, big John Flanagan, who emigrated to the US at the age of 28 and was working in New York, was to set an unprecedented Olympic record.         
	Three consecutive titles in the hammer-throwing event were to give Flanagan something special to add to his already-coveted English and Irish titles, as well as his US titles, won three years in a row in 1897, 1898 and 1899.         
	Policeman guards his gold         
	The policeman gave notice of his intention to dominate with a throw of 51.11m in a competition prior to Paris. A throw of 49.73m brought Flanagan his first Olympic gold medal in the colours of America, his adopted country.         
	Following the Games in 1900, Flanagan was to retain his superiority in the event as American champion, but by the time it came round to competing in St Louis, Flanagan, born on January 9, 1868, was already aged 36. In the eyes of many, he was too old and increasingly up against younger competition.         
	Yet Flanagans forte was his personalised and very effective technique. Turning twice in the circle before releasing the hammer, he was able to compensate for age with a technique used to habitually-victorious effect.         
	It was this technique which, during St Louis in 1904, brought him a second title while being trailed closely by compatriot John DeWit, who had shown promise by beating the Olympic record with a throw of 50.26m.         
	Flanagan also took part in the 56-pound weight-throwing event, promptly taking silver with a throw of 10.16m.         
	Digging deep         
	If the decision to compete in St Louis had temporarily caused Flanagan to reflect on his sporting ability, then his American title in 1907 must have at least given him, at 39-years-old, some extra confidence. Add to that a pre-Olympic throw, and new world record, of 53.35m, and any criticism aimed at what was obviously an athlete in the prime of his career could have been easily discounted.         
	The London bookmakers were to favour a younger challenger, his compatriot Matthew McGrath, who he had previously beaten in the national championships. Trailing McGrath and compatriot Cornelius Walsh at the second throw, Flanagan had to dig deep to find something special to surpass a modest throw and potential third place. With his fourth throw, Flanagan came good, and lay in second position  much to the anxiety of the young McGrath.         
	Flanagans final throw was enough to unnerve his younger compatriot, who missed his final attempt, handing the Irish-American his third, and historic, consecutive Olympic title.               
	ANECDOTES         
	In the shade         
	These Games were organised against a backdrop of general indifference as the Parisians were preoccupied by the International Exhibition. The competition was more like an international meeting rather than true Olympic Games.         
	Unknown sport         
	Following the example of the unknown soldier, the Olympics had its own unknown medal. In rowing, in the coxed pairs, the Dutch team won gold using an 8 or 9-year-old boy as coxswain. He was brought in to replace the named cox who was deemed too heavy. After the race the unexpected Olympic champion disappeared without even leaving his name. In any case, he undoubtedly remains the youngest competitor in Olympic history and the youngest champion.         
	Better late than never         
	A gardener at the Racing Club of France, Michel Theato, won the marathon but received his reward 12 years later when it was finally acknowledged that he was the official winner.         
	Late awards         
	Podium finishers received their medals only in 1912. In 1900, they were given small presents as a means of compensation: plates, umbrellas or wallets.         
	Tricky circuit         
	Australias Frederick Lane won the obstacle swimming race  the obstacles were boats that were cleared by swimming under them.         
	Gods wishes         
	The pole vault competition was held on a Sunday. In the first instance the event was moved because the Americans wanted to respect Sunday as a rest day. But the organisers changed their minds and several Americans left the stadium. So as to appease the visitors from the other side of the ocean a second competition was held a few days later, although results, which were an improvement on those from the initial competition were not taken into account.         
	Tree trouble         
	A superb tree stood in the middle of the area used by shot putters and discus throwers. Nothing suggested beforehand the importance this would have in the competition.               
	SUMMARY         
	The year of the international exhibition         
	Dreaming of a huge festival in his own country, baron Pierre de Coubertin appeared disappointed in 1900 by the second Games, of which he had taken over the responsibility in Paris in spite of Greeces insistence for a permanent site in Athens. That year, Paris was preoccupied with the International Exhibition, of which the Eiffel Tower had been the showpiece. Whilst the baron wanted to use this event as a springboard, it proved more of a hindrance. With no opening or closing ceremonies the Games were spread out between May 20 and October 28, in indifference and confusion, to the four corners of the capital. De Coubertin would say later: Its a miracle the Olympic movement survived these Games.         
	Makeshift venues         
	Competing in makeshift venues around a thousand athletes from up to 20 countries took part in 17 (18 disciplines) different sports. Some of these were open to women, notably tennis and golf. Englands Charlotte Cooper became the first woman champion when winning both singles and doubles in the tennis tournament.         
	The star of these Games was Americas Alvin Kraenzlein, who excelled on the athletics track. In winning four individual titles in the course of one Games he was to set an unprecedented Olympic standard. Kraenzlein collected gold in the long jump, 60m, and both the 110m and 200m hurdles.

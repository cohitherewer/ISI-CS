The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kapils 175 still the best, says Sunny
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kapils 175 still the best, says Sunny
                      
	Bangalore: Batting legend Sunil Gavaskar on Tuesday described Kapil Devs unbeaten 175 against Zimbabwe during Indias successful 1983 World Cup campaign as the best one-day innings ever.         
	Gavaskar recalled that it was a match that India had to win to enter the semi-final.         
	When you had lost half of your side with less than 20 runs on the board, obviously it was not looking good. But this gentleman (Kapil) went out and played his innings...Best innings I have seen in limited overs Internationals.         
	That 175 has to be in my view the greatest knock in the World Cup, Gavaskar said while speaking at a media meet. The UB group will host a gala dinner for the 1983 World Cup winning team in London on June 25 to mark the 25th anniversary of the historic triumph.         
	Kapil said captaining the 1983 side was not difficult as everybody was playing well at the time.         
	He said even after he took that famous catch to dismiss Vivian Richards off Madan Lal, the final was open as Clive Lloyd was still at the crease.         
	Lloyd was the most dangerous player, Kapil said. Members of the 1983 World Cup team, Roger Binny and Syed Kirmani, also shared their experience.         
	BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said the board would hold a special event in Delhi on June 22 to felicitate the players of the 1983 team. (PTI)

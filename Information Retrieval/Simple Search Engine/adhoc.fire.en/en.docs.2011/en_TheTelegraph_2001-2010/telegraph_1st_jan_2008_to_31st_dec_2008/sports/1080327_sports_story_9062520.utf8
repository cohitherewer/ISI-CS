The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sunny, Speed have civil discussion
                                                     Sunny, Speed have civil discussion
  - I think everybody is looking for yes men, says an infuriated Kapil       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev                                   
	Calcutta: Sunil Gavaskar and Malcolm Speed, the outgoing chief executive of the International Cricket Council (ICC), had a civil discussion for at least 30 minutes on Wednesday.         
	They met in Dubai, where the ICC is headquartered.         
	An ICC media release didnt exactly say so in as many words, but its clear that Gavaskar, who heads the powerful cricket committee, has been asked to choose between continuing in that role and working as a TV commentator and columnist.         
	The former India captain has to get back with his views after the next cricket committee meeting, on May 5-6, and before the ICCs annual conference week (June 29-July 4).         
	Gavaskars term ends in the summer of 2010.         
	The chief executive and Gavaskar had a civil discussion Theyve worked with each other for years Its for Gavaskar to weigh his options and get back to the ICC, a spokesman for the world body said in the evening.         
	The release, by the way, included the following: The meeting followed discussions by the ICC (executive) board last week concerning the potential for a conflict of interest for a person chairing the cricket committee while, at the same time, working for a media outlet         
	Whats strange is that the ICC has suddenly woken up to the potential for a conflict, even though Gavaskar had been a mediaman when he got the chairmanship eight years ago.         
	Obviously, Gavaskars brutally candid comments (both on the TV and in his columns) during Team Indias recent tour of Australia have made the ICC  particularly England and Australia  see red.         
	Even more strangely, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) hasnt extended any support to Gavaskar.         
	The BCCI did issue a statement on Wednesday afternoon, but it made for pathetic reading. At the very least, there should have been one line saying that it would take up Gavaskars cause if the ICCs executive board made an issue of the conflict of interest.         
	The question doing the rounds is: Has a deal been struck, whereby the BCCI wont cry foul and, as a result, gain in some other manner?         
	Among those very upset with developments is another distinguished former India captain, Kapil Dev, now being treated as an outcast by the BCCI for his involvement with the Indian Cricket League.         
	I think everybody is looking for yes men Sunil began writing columns decades ago, so whats new? Also, if he holds an honorary position, then now can he be stopped from earning his livelihood? The ICC should be broad-minded, he told The Telegraph.         
	Kapil added: Im not surprised that the BCCI hasnt come out in Sunils support... In fact, has it ever really had time for us players? It may look after the big stars as long as theyre playing, use them, and then forget them once theyre through with the game... That, for me, is the BCCI...         
	Indias only World Cup-winning captain has, clearly, experienced it all. Incidentally, Kapils isnt exactly a lone voice.

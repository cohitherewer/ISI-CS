The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No problems with Hamilton, says Alonso
                                                                                                                                                                                                     No problems with Hamilton, says Alonso
                      
	Madrid: Two-time Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso claimed on Monday he had no problems with British teammate Lewis Hamilton during their contentious time together at McLaren.         
	There is always a lot of talk about him and this antagonism was created but there was never any problem, he told a daily.         
	Alonso has rejoined Renault after spending a season with McLaren that was marked by media speculation of a feud between the two drivers, and accusations that the team favoured Hamilton.         
	Hamilton controversially won the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix after Alonso was dropped from pole for holding up his teammate during qualifying.         
	The world champion was demoted five grid places after a stewards investigation ruled Alonso had been wrong to wait in front of Hamilton in the pits for 30 seconds ahead of the pairs final qualifying runs.         
	People talk about Hungary, of the pit-stop, but it was not his fault, Alonso said.         
	It was the team that should have taken steps and if I was supposed to leave first and make an extra round to burn more gas they should have made sure that things would be that way. But they werent interested in all that, he added.         
	Alonso, who won back-to-back world championships with Renault in 2005 and 2006 and came close last year with McLaren has hinted at leaving the French side if it does not perform well this season.         
	My first option is to stay at Renault if we succeed in creating a winning car and the truth is we are making progress, he said.         
	But what I want is to race in a car that can give me victories. There are several, Williams, Toyota, BMW and Ferrari that are always on top no matter what happens, he added.         
	After a disappointing start to the season, Renault has been experimenting with changes to its R28 car, aimed at improving its aerodynamic set up.         
	Last month Alonso finished in fourth place behind Hamilton at the Australian Grand Prix. (AFP)

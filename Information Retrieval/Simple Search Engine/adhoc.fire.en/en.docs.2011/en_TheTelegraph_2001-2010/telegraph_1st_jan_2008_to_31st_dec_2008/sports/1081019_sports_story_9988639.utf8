                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kumble feeling better

	Chandigarh: Regular Test captain Anil Kumble is feeling better and should be available for the last two matches against Australia.         
	Im feeling better... Its just a (right shoulder) strain, nothing more... Ive got to give it rest and also strengthen it... Thats being done, Kumble, who opted out of the ongoing second Test in neighbouring Mohali, told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	The good news for Kumble, who turned 38 on Friday, is that the third match will be quite some days after the Mohali one  from October 29, in New Delhi.         
	The fourth Test will, of course, be pretty much back-to-back  in Nagpur, from November 6.         
	The selection for the last two matches is scheduled to be done on Tuesday.

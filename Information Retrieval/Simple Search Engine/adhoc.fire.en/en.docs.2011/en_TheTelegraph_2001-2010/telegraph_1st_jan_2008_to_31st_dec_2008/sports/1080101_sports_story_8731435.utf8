                                                    Dont want to miss the SCG Test: Sourav

 - Former India captain feeling better, but says the fever hasnt gone altogether

	Sydney: Sourav Ganguly is still unwell, but is determined to play the second Test, at the SCG, from Wednesday. 
    
	Im feeling better than yesterday (Sunday) and certainly dont want to miss the Test, Sourav told The Telegraph. 
    
	Speaking at the Radisson Plaza on Monday evening, some hours after Team Indias arrival from Melbourne, he added: The medicines are controlling the fever, but it hasnt gone altogether... 
    
	Sourav and his family, incidentally, skipped the New Years eve cruise organised for the players and the support staff. 
    
	No point catching a chill and aggravating my condition, he said. 
    
	Souravs illness has, of course, creased the Indian think tanks forehead. On form, after all, hes indispensable. 
    
	As it is, the men who matter have been hassled over the second openers slot. 
    
	Clearly, the Rahul Dravid experiment at the MCG left everybody cold and the buzz is that Virender Sehwag is being strongly considered as Wasim Jaffers partner. 
    
	Assuming Sourav makes a complete recovery, then Sehwag can only come in if Yuvraj Singh gets dropped. 
    
	Like most batsmen, Yuvraj was a flop in the first Test. 
    
	Manager Chetan Chauhan (a former India opener), however, has vowed that the team will bounce back and that too much shouldnt be read into the thrashing in Melbourne. 
    
	Its a big statement which needs to be backed up with a strong on-field performance. 
    
	Footnote: The team management, meanwhile, has strongly refuted a report in one of Australias leading dailies which (mis)quoted cricket manager (or acting coach) Lalchand Rajput as saying there was a problem with Yuvrajs attitude. Chauhan and an agitated Rajput himself issued denials. As for Yuvraj, he quipped: Attitude problem? Woh to mera bachpan se hai!

                                                   SCG crowd abused Bhajji, Gambhir

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Brisbane: The Australian medias attempts to land Harbhajan Singh in the dock have failed. 
    
	Match Referee Jeff Crowe, a former New Zealand captain, has ruled that there was no evidence to suggest the Indian offie had made monkey-like gestures towards a section of the SCG crowd on Sunday. 
    
	Crowe took note of pictures (a couple of them rather amusing) published in the Sydney Morning Herald, but found that there was nothing to substantiate the allegation. 
    
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Crowe also checked with Channel Nine whether it had footage which would prove the charge. The network replied in the negative. 
    
	A statement from the International Cricket Council quoted Crowe, who is still in Sydney, as saying: I have investigated the alleged incident with Cricket Australias ground security officials after reading newspaper reports and viewing related photographs that have been published. After reviewing all available information, I conclude that there is no need to take any action against Harbhajan Singh. 
    
	The most damning picture, at least in the eyes of the newspaper in question, was one where the offie is seen scratching his right armpit. But, then, that could be done for perfectly legitimate reasons and it was absurd to link it to a monkey-like gesture. 
    
	Then, The Daily Telegraph quoted one fan from the over 31,000 whod turned up for the tri-series first final to charge that Harbhajan had repeatedly spat in the direction where he and others were sitting. What got glossed over is that sections of the SCG kept abusing the offie and, according to manager Dr Bimal Soni, theyd even hurt his religious sentiments. 
    
	The tri-series highest scorer, Gautam Gambhir, too was abused. 
    
	These things can happen and our players acted like professionals and didnt react to the severe provocation However, this has been taken up with the Match Referee, pointed out Dr Soni. 
    
	Andrew Symonds, it may be recalled, had been subjected to monkey-like gestures during Australias short tour of India last September-October and the cops had evicted the offenders during the final ODI, in Mumbai. 
    
	Then, during the SCG Test in January, Symonds had accused Harbhajan of calling him a monkey. The charge was upheld, but the offie was successful in getting the three-Test ban overturned. 
    
	Its pretty clear that Harbhajan (called an obnoxious little weed by Matthew Hayden last week) hasnt only been targeted by the Australian team but the media as well. 
    
	There were cameras which followed every move of his, remarked a pretty disgusted member of the Team India contingent.

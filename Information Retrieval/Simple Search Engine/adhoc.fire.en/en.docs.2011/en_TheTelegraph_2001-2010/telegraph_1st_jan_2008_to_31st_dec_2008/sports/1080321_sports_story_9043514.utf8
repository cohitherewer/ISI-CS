The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC looks at May return
                                                   ICC looks at May return
                      
	London: Controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair could return to international cricket in Englands three-Test series against New Zealand starting at Lords on May 15.         
	International Cricket Council (ICC) general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson said on Thursday that the world governing body would soon be making its appointments for the series starting after April 1.         
	England and New Zealand both seem to be happy with him, Richardson said over the phone from Dubai. There wouldnt be anything standing in the way of appointing him to that series.         
	Richardson said the ICC would take Pakistans reaction into account when appointing Hair to international matches.         
	Arjuna Ranatunga, meanwhile, seems to have forgiven his old foe Hair. Unlike Pakistan, Ranatunga, also head of Sri Lanka Cricket, said the official should be given a fair chance to umpire in matches involving all countries on his return.         
	Ranatunga told a Pakistan TV channel that unless Hair stood in matches featuring all countries he could not be tested.         
	We actually discussed this issue at the ICC meeting and we mentioned our concerns about the Darrell Hair issue. I think the important factor is that if he is eligible to umpire, he should do all our matches featuring India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Otherwise he would not be tested. We have to take it in a practical way and go ahead, Ranatunga said. (REUTERS)

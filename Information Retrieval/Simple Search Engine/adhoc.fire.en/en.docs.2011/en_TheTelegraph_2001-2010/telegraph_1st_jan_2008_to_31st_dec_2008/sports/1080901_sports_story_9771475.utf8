The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds mulls quitting cricket
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Symonds mulls quitting cricket
            A STAFF REPORTER            Andrew Symonds                           
	Calcutta: It could be curtains for Andrew Symonds. After being unceremoniously booted out of the Australia squad for an ill-timed fishing trip, the Queensland allrounder is considering quitting the game altogether.         
	According to the Sydney-based The Daily Telegraph, Symonds is so disillusioned with his treatment over the gone fishing debacle  and struggling so much with the demands of being a high-profile cricketer  that he is considering quitting the game that has made him a millionaire.         
	According to the report, Symonds, ordered home from Darwin for going fishing and missing a compulsory team meeting, has clashed with Cricket Australia (CA) for more than a year and the allrounder is now mulling over his future and deciding whether his heart is still in playing for his country.         
	I have been asked to think about what is important to me and I will take this time to do that, the newspaper quoted Symonds as saying.         
	I would ask that during this time, people respect my privacy and that of my friends and family.         
	I would like to say thanks for the many messages of support I have received over the past day or so, the allrounder was quoted as saying.         
	The newspaper said that Symonds was bunkered down with friends, girlfriend Katie Johnson and manager Matt Fearon on Saturday but several sources close to the cricketer believed that he is yet to decide whether he wants to return to international cricket.         
	The 33-year-old will not know until plenty of soul-searching and advice from close friends and family.         
	Symonds would lose his $500,000 CA contract if he abandoned the game in Australia. However, there would still be the potential for him to earn big bucks in the subcontinent if he chose to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) or even the rebel Indian Cricket League.         
	The fact that the Queenslander may be close to walking away from the game comes as no great surprise to many of his teammates, who have started to lose patience with the allrounder as they watched his attitude deteriorate, said the report.         
	It is also not the first time Symonds has thought of quitting cricket.         
	In 2002, a depressed and disenchanted Symonds contacted Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett and talked about walking away from cricket and reinventing himself as a rugby league player.         
	In the next two weeks, Australia will pick their team for Octobers tour of India and there are grave doubts whether he will have his mind sufficiently on the job to continue his career in the subcontinental hotspot.

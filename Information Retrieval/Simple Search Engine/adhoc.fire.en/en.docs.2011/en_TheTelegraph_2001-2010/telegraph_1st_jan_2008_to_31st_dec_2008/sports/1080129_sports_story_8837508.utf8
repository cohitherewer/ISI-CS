                                                  Adam Gilchrist: Id lost that absolute desperation
  - Dropping Laxman at the Adelaide Oval made the World No. 1 wicketkeeper decide to retire       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Adam Gilchrist with wife Mel and children (from left) Annie, Harrison and Archie after Australia and India drew their final Test in Adelaide on Monday. (Reuters)                                 
	Adelaide: Adam Gilchrist broke down when he thanked his three kids for their love and understanding but, otherwise, the wicketkeeper-batsman who reinvigorated cricket (actually, he redefined so much) was an absolute pro on his last day as a Test cricketer.         
	Besides interacting generally with the media, Gilchrist briefly spoke exclusively to The Telegraph too.         
	Incidentally, in what was a first, Gilchrists family (immediate and extended) lined the back of the media centre during the Q amp;A session.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On what stands out as he reflects on his career         
	The first thing would be the camaraderie in the team... The passion and pride of being in that team... I believe the way that legacy is passed on from generation to generation is the most glowing strength of Australian cricket... Im seeing this happening in other countries as well... Im not saying they lacked pride before, but theyre making the world aware of it... Teams are getting strength from that passion and pride.         
	On whether, at any time, the emotional response from across the world to his decision to quit tempted him to reconsider         
	(Grins) Not at all... Its been a great few days since I got that clarity in the mind... I wasnt trying to fool anybody by saying Id carry on for another 12 months... Id been considering giving up one-day cricket after this summer and, then, trying to get a bit more Test cricket in... But once that clarity came, I knew the time was right.         
	On that moment of clarity         
	Somewhere between the Brett Lee ball hitting my gloves and hitting the ground... It was the (V.V.S.) Laxman edge in the first innings here... I dont want to sound melodramatic, but its amazing the way things happen... I dont think anyone in this room has missed the fact that I missed a few catches in this series... It puzzled me and I wasnt quite sure why... I was working hard, but when I watched that replay, I realised Id been slow in my movement... It made me realise in the ensuing 10-15 minutes that thats it... I wasnt moving quite as well, not only out in the middle but at training too... I realised that I didnt have the absolute desperation you need to continue to maintain your standards... I was enjoying the role of a senior in the team, I was enjoying playing, but didnt have that desperation... Id lost that absolute desperation... What contributed was new members cropping up in my immediate family every few years and in my extended family... Theres more on my mind and, after discussing with (wife) Mel that night, I realised it was time to go.         
	On whether hell be able to focus on the one-off Twenty20 and the tri-series, so soon after an overwhelming few days         
	Im really looking forward to the next month... Glenn McGrath had announced hed retire after the last World Cup and, so, he knew there was a finish line... He was relaxed and won the Player of the Tournament... Im not making predictions, but Im excited about the tri-series... One-day cricket gave me opportunities... Allowed me to make a statement in the world of cricket and, so, its nice that Ill be bowing out in that form instead of having extended my Test career... Right now, Im going to enjoy this moment with the family and then knuckle down to whats coming up.         
	On whether cricket today is stronger than when he made his debut (first in the ODIs, 1996)         
	I dont like to compare eras... Am not sure on that.         
	On the one special memory         
	India, 2004-05... The moment Ricky (Ponting) got injured during the Champions Trophy which preceded that tour, I realised Id be offered the reins... I got a bit nervous and had a few self-doubts, but things went well and we won that (four-Test) series... The tour had an amazing build-up and there were big expectations... I regard that as my highest achievement.         
	On moments of self-doubt         
	There definitely are such moments in everyones careers... Tough times are there and its about how you get over them... You draw on your experience, draw on your teammates and, more so, draw on the love and support of family and friends... Fortunately, except for one brother (Glenn), who has been out of reach in Queensland, theyre all here... Theyve shared my journey.         
	On whether, given that there are quite a few older players in Team India too, the future of the India-Australia rivalry is in safe hands         
	Very much so... Brett Lee, for example, has been phenomenal this summer... Weve lost Glenn and Shane Warne from the bowling stock, but Bretts taken on the responsibility... Indeed, after unveiling a fast bowler in Ishant Sharma, the Indian team too has so much to look forward to... R.P. Singh continues to rise and Irfan Pathan has come back (into the Test XI)... Then, while I dont see Virender Sehwag as a youngster, hes back and has shown his experience... Hopefully, we can keep it a healthy rivalry.         
	On the fact that his retirement will also bring the curtain down on the era of walking         
	Its not for me to tell anyone what to do or what not to do... Its a personal decision... Youve got to make a choice and stick with it. I certainly dont have disrespect for the guys who dont walk... Its their choice and its part of the game.         
	On plans for the future         
	Im not one hundred per cent sure what direction my life will take... Ive been fortunate in having forged wonderful relationships with sponsors... Id love to pursue those relationships... Ive always wanted to offer them more than just a face to a product. Hopefully, therell be opportunities... Of course, therell be more time for the family.         
	On the Board of Control for Cricket in India-promoted IPL         
	I see that as an amazing entertainment package... I was a bit of a reluctant starter for the Twenty20, being a bit of a traditionalist, but over time Ive realised that its an important part of the cricket structure now... Ive heard guys talk about World Series Cricket and how exciting it was to be a part of that... I see this IPL situation being very similar to that... Ive tried to be entertaining throughout my career, but Ive done the real serious hard yards and enjoyed it all... The sweat and the tears...         
	On the pressure on his successor         
	Weve got a guy (Brad Haddin) right at the peak of his game... Hes shown that he can handle international cricket... His glovework is outstanding and hes going to make a real impression on the world stage... I dont think theres going to be more pressure... (After a pause) Id looked at myself as fitting into an allrounders type of a role... I extended our batting line-up... Whatever the form of cricket, across the world, youre now looking at allrounders... Guys wholl do two things.         
	On whether he believes the world of cricket will remember him more for his batting rather than wicketkeeping         
	(Laughs) Yes, no doubt about that, but its fine... Im not going to grumble about it... Its just that Ive always felt I had to defend my keeping a little bit... Maybe thats because I wasnt technically perfect or as amazing as some of the wicketkeepers weve had prior to me... But I was effective and did what I had to do. My battings been great fun... Ive been amazed by the number of people whore saying thank you for the entertainment... Actually, when youre out in the middle, you dont think that youve got to entertain or whatever... You just do what youre supposed to do... I entertained because Id myself been entertained while growing up... That inspired me... Yesterday (Sunday), Id been overwhelmed and in wanting to entertain, ended up spooning a catch...         
	On where would he rank his 149 in last years World Cup final against Sri Lanka         
	Its hard to rate individual milestones... The World Cup had been tough, but I got it right on the biggest day on the biggest stage... It had been tough as wed just had our third child and, again, I had to leave Mel and the baby within five days... It had been a lonely and difficult time to get through... To pick myself up and play such an innings was special...         
	On whether, as stand-in captain, he regrets having declared (setting England a target of 315) at Headingley in the 2001 Ashes         
	No...         
	Finally, on how would he like to be remembered         
	(Emotionally) Well, I dont know... I suppose as someone who gave everything to the team... That, probably, will be a nice way to be remembered.

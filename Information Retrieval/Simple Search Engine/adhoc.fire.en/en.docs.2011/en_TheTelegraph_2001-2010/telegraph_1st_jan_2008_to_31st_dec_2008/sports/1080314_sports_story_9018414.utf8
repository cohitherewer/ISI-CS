The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Looks like Bindra or SAs Patel
                                                     Looks like Bindra or SAs Patel
  - NEXT ICC CHIEF EXECUTIVE       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            I. S. Bindra                                 
	Calcutta: Inderjit Singh Bindra and two South Africans  Haroon Lorgat and Imtiaz Patel  are in the race to succeed Malcolm Speed as the International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive.         
	While Bindra is a distinguished former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Lorgat is a one-time selection committee chairman and Patel is chief executive of the popular SuperSport channel.         
	An ICC sub-committee, which will make its recommendation to the all-powerful executive board, meets in Dubai on Saturday. The board is scheduled to sit two days later.         
	Bindra is keeping cards close to his chest, but theres no certainty that hell actually take up the job if its offered to him.         
	The family will have to relocate to Dubai (where the ICC is headquartered) and that wont be an easy decision Then, Bindra is closely associated with the soon-to-begin Indian Premier League and his presence will be required at home, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	Bindra himself wasnt available for a comment.         
	If Bindra pulls out or declines the offer, then its quite likely that the BCCI will back Patel, who worked under the dynamic Dr Ali Bacher in the 1990s.         
	Lorgat, one understands, has the support of the next ICC president  Englands David Morgan  but that probably is just about it. Eventually, then, it could either be Bindra or Patel moving into Speeds chair.         
	Bindras credentials are, of course, well known. Equally, many have a high regard for Patels administrative acumen. It couldnt be confirmed, but his roots are in India.         
	Morgan is on the four-man sub-committee, with the others being outgoing ICC president Ray Mali (a South African, by the way), BCCI chief Sharad Pawar and Cricket Australia chairman Creagh Connor.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Board supremo, Dr Nasim Ashraf, is a special invitee, but doesnt have a vote. Given the critical nature of the post, one expects the appointment to be unanimous.         
	Connor, incidentally, has recently undergone back surgery and its not clear whether hell travel to Dubai.

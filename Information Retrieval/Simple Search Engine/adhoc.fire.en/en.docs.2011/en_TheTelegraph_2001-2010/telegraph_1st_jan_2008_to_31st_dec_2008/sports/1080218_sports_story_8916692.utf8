The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB could hike grant to appease units
                                                   CAB could hike grant to appease units
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CAB is toying with the idea of increasing the grant to affiliated units to appease the disgruntled members on the IPL ticket-distribution issue.         
	The grant will be earmarked for infrastructural development. The state association is due to get Rs 10 crore from the BCCI in the first year for hosting IPL matches and has already allotted Rs 1 lakh to each of its 121 units.         
	A proposal is likely to be tabled to this effect when the working committee meets on Monday. The committee will also decide on the date for the special general body meeting.         
	According to sources, the BCCI is also reviewing its stand of giving only 20 per cent tickets in each of the Eden Gardens blocks to the CAB. Till Saturday, IPL chairman Lalit Modi was adamant but positions changed after a top CAB official spoke to BCCI president Sharad Pawar.         
	The BCCI understands that the amount of revenue that could be generated from hosting matches at the Eden wouldnt be the same as in Ahmedabad or Kanpur, said a CAB official.         
	CAB president Prasun Mukherjee has been feeling the heat with the clubs demanding at least 40 per cent of the seats.         
	The clubs also want the agreement with Red Chillies Entertainment  the franchisee of Shah Rukh Khan-owned city team  be placed before the working committee members.         
	How can Eden be given to a third party for hosting matches when the lease hasnt yet been renewed? Moreover, how will local cricket engagements be completed when the Eden will be unavailable for a month, asked a club official.         
	Mukherjee is hoping things will be sorted out and matches held as scheduled.         
	If the CAB fails to get the backing of the members at the SGM, then one of the centres from Cuttack, Ahmedabad, Gwalior and Kanpur would be given the go ahead.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Debate over one Lanka berth
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: The Sri Lankan think-tanks mind, one learns, has been made up where 10 positions for the first Test are concerned. The debate, apparently, is over a solitary middle-order berth.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Chamara Silva and Chamara Kapugedera are in contention for one position.         
	Those certain are: Captain Mahela Jayawardene, vice-captain Kumar Sangakkara, Malintha Warnapura, Michael Vandort, Thilan Samaraweera, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Nuwan Kulasekera, Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis. The last-named will be making his (Test) debut.         
	The injury-prone quick, Dilhara Fernando, isnt in the 14 because of, well, yet another injury.

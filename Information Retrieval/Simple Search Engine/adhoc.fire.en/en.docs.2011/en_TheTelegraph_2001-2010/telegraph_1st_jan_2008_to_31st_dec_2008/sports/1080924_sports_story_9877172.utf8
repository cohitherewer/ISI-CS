The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Switzerland to face US in Davis Cup 1st round
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Switzerland to face US in Davis Cup 1st round
                      
	Madrid: Roger Federers Switzerland will travel to face the United States in the first round of the 2009 Davis Cup World Group. The draw was released in Madrid on Tuesday.         
	Switzerland will face the 2007 winners on March 6-8 in a tie that could feature the worlds No. 1 ranked doubles pair, and the Olympic gold medal winning pair.         
	In recent years Federer has opted out of playing in the first-round due to scheduling conflicts but with the tie taking place just before the start of the American hardcourt season, the five-times US Open champion could at long last commit himself to his countrys cause. In another fascinating tie, Spain will host Serbia, which could see world No. 1 Rafael Nadal facing number three Novak Djokovic.         
	In new developments, organisers said that players will collect ATP ranking points for matches played in the Davis Cup next year, and that dates for the rounds had been modified to better fit in with the ATP calendar.         
	Quarter final ties will be played on July 10-12, the semi-finals on Sept. 18-20 and the final on Dec. 4-6. The other 2008 finalists Argentina, were drawn at home to Holland.         
	Meanwhile, India have been seeded third in Group I of the Asia/Oceania zone. They have been given a bye in the first round. (Agencies)

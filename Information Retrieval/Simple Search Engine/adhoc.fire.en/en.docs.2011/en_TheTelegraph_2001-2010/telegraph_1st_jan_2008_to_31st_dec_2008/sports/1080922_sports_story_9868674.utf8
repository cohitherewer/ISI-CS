The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICL ban should be revoked: Inzamam
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ICL ban should be revoked: Inzamam
    - Decision will strain relations with BCCI, fears SLC official                   Inzamam-ul Haq                           
	Karachi/Colombo: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has called on the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to take a cue from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and lift the ban imposed on players, who have aligned with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	Inzamam and Moin Khan, who themselves play in the rebel ICL, said the SLCs bold step showed that Pakistan can also take an independent decision on its ICL contracted players.         
	Pakistan needs to stop doing what India wants. Cricket is the bread and butter of the banned players and they have committed no crime by opting to play in the ICL which is now growing and is an alternative for players, Inzamam said.         
	Sri Lanka has set a bold and fair precedent. English counties have stuck to their principles by allowing ICL players and I think very soon the ICC will also have to rethink its policy on the ICL, he added.         
	Moin made it clear that the players banned by boards had not entirely ruled out legal action against the authorities.         
	It is an option available to us because we are confident if things go to court many people will be uncomfortable, he said.         
	Another former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif said the ban on ICL players was unjustified.         
	I dont think the IPL can continue calling the shots for long now. Something has to give way after the bold stand taken by Sri Lanka and the English players, Latif said.         
	Many in the PCB also believe that SLC president Arjuna Ranatunga has sent out a message to the Indian Premier League (IPL) by lifting the domestic ban on his countrys players signed up with the rebel ICL.         
	It is obvious that Ranatunga, who is a powerful and influential figure in Sri Lankan cricket and politics, is not happy with the way IPL has started to influence the cricket playing nations and their international cricket commitments, an official in the cricket said.         
	It is no secret that Sri Lankan cricket officials are unhappy that their players are not willing to make a Test tour of England to play in the IPL, the official, who didnt want to be named, said.         
	The Sri Lankan players have taken up their case with the President of the country as they say they cant tour England as it clashes with their prior commitments with the private IPL.         
	Ranatunga wants them to give priority to playing for their national team as the unscheduled tour would ensure finances for the Sri Lankan board.         
	Another official said it is no secret that some countries are uncomfortable with the growing influence of the IPL, especially the way IPL chief Lalit Modi is trying to dictate to other countries and their boards, because of the money involved in it.         
	The Sri Lankan authorities recently decided to lift a domestic ban on five of their leading players who defected to the ICL including former captain Marvan Atapattu and leading all-rounders Russell Arnold and Upul Chandana, though the ban on their playing for the national team remains         
	This has led to appeals from various quarters for other countries to also review their ban of ICL players.         
	On the other hand, the decision of the SLC to permit ICL-linked players to participate in their domestic tournament has not gone down well with some SLC officials who feel the move would strain relationship with the powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	I think the decision to permit Sri Lankan players aligned with ICL will strain the relationship between the SLC and the BCCI, a senior SLC official said.         
	The official felt that though the ICC had not taken any decision on the ICL-linked players, the BCCI was leaving no stone unturned to ban players aligned with the unofficial league.         
	Another SLC official said the BCCI had been friendly with the Lankan Board and the decision on the ICL players would offend the BCCI.         
	BCCI is the power house as far as the world cricket is concerned and I hope the issue is sorted out to further strengthen the relationship between the Indian and Sri Lankan boards, he said.         
	Former captain Marvan Atapattu, who along with four other players has started using SLC facilities after the lifting of the ban on playing domestic tournaments, had urged other cricket boards to follow suit in lifting the ban on ICL players in their respective countries.

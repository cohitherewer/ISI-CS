                                                   Carlos blasts meets timing

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira described the timing of the IFA Shield as unscientific, saying players should have got rest after the ONGC I-League. 
    
	I am not happy with the idea of playing in another tournament immediately after the I-League. The boys are getting little time to rest This is unscientific, the Brazilian said on the eve of the IFA Shield opener against Churchill Brothers. 
    
	Pereira, however, insisted that winning the meet would be his priority. I know the importance of the IFA Shield and we want to finish off the season by winning it, he maintained. 
    
	According to him, the Bhaichung Bhutia-Jose Barreto combine will once again hold the ace. They are my key players and Im looking for an inspired performance from them, he added. 
    
	Churchill Brothers coach Karim Bencherifa played down the absence of the I-Leagues highest scorer Odafe Okolie. Its not a factor. We play as a team, he said. 
    
	Meanwhile, outstation teams appeared unhappy over playing with Cosco balls in the tournament. Cosco balls are harder. Having played the entire season with lighter Nike balls, its difficult to get adjusted to harder balls, Mahindra coach Derrick Pereira said. 
    
	According to IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly, the association is contractually bound to use Cosco balls in local meets.

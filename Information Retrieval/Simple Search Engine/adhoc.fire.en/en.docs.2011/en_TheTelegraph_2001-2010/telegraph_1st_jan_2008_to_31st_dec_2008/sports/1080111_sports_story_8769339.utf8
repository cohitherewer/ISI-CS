                                                   Well review behaviour, says Ricky

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: An anxious phone call from his wife has led Ricky Ponting to pledge to ensure his sides behaviour is not seen to be arrogant in future matches. 
    
	The Australian captain on Thursday admitted he wished he and his mates had done a few things slightly differently at Sydney, and promised to watch footage to see where things may have gone out of hand. 
    
	He said he first realised the gravity of the situation when wife Rianna called up to check whether he still had his job. Many Australian fans, former players and journalists have criticised the teams behaviour and some have called for the captains head. 
    
	Have you seen the papers? she (Rianna) asked and said: Is everything OK with your job? She was a bit worried and a bit shaken. I said everything will be OK, Ponting told Herald Sun newspaper. 
    
	The couple had married in 2003 and Ponting credits Riannas steadying influence for the rich form he struck almost immediately, hitting three double centuries in a year. He had blown a kiss at the tall blonde, a law graduate, after completing one of the 200s, against India at Adelaide in December 2003. 
    
	Rianna, in a TV interview in 2005, had described her husband as a flawless man and perfect. 
    
	Ponting, however, on Thursday said he regretted some of his actions at Sydney, like standing too long at the crease after being given out lbw in the first innings. 
    
	Theres no doubt I stood there for a second or two too long and I shouldnt have done that. And it probably didnt help that I was shown throwing my bat when I got back to the rooms, he said. 
    
	Some of the guys mightnt have shaken Kumbles hand after the game, he added. 
    
	But we were so wrapped up with the end of the game that they were already off the field. And we all walked along when it was over and shook their hands. 
    
	He said he would go through the Tests highlights to see how some of his teams actions may have looked to fans. 
    
	I think its important that we sit back and look at that footage. Look at our body language. See if there are areas that we can improve on. 
    
	But he said sometimes the public was mistaken. I may be talking to opposition players but it might be construed by people watching on television that youre in a slanging or sledging match. 
    
	If we were big-headed and arrogant we wouldnt have been celebrating like that, he said. Big-headedness doesnt go hand in hand with the sort of euphoria we showed.

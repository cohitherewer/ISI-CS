                                                                                                                                                                                                       Federer slow off blocks, in last 4
  - Safina sees off Dementieva, to meet Kuznetsova in semis             Dinara Safina after her victory on Wednesday                           
	Paris: Roger Federer lost three of his first four service games on Wednesday, which caused a stir among French Open fans but only briefly delayed his progress to the semi-finals.         
	The top-ranked Federer rallied to defeat Fernando Gonzalez 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 and reach the final four at his 16th consecutive Grand Slam event.         
	I was really under pressure in the first set, Federer said.         
	Seeking the only major title he has yet to win, Federer on Friday will face the winner between unseeded Frenchman Gael Monfils and No. 5-seeded David Ferrer.         
	Russian Dinara Safina came within a point of defeat for the second consecutive match, but made the semi-finals by beating compatriot Elena Dementieva 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-0.         
	The semi-final berth is the first in a major tournament for Safina, the younger sister of two-time Grand Slam champion Marat Safin.         
	Federer lost the first set in 25 minutes but wasnt broken after that. He won 36 of his final 40 service points, including the last 17 in a row.         
	The No. 13-seeded Safina trailed Dementieva 2-5 in the second set and faced a match point in the next game, but Dementieva dumped a return into the net. That triggered a sudden reversal, and Safina lost only one game the rest of the way.         
	Her opponent in the semi-final will be another Russian, 2004 US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova.         
	Kuznetsova recovered from her own slow start to beat unseeded Kaia Kanepi 7-5, 6-2.         
	The other womens semi-final will be an all-Serb match, with No. 2 seed Ana Ivanovic playing No. 3 Jelena Jankovic.         
	The big-hitting Safina changed tactics when she fell behind in the second set, switching to a less aggressive approach. The strategy coaxed a flurry of errors from an increasingly flustered Dementieva.         
	Safina won five consecutive games to climb back into the match, and Dementieva had to erase three set points in the next game to hold for six-all.         
	In the tie-breaker, Dementieva committed three consecutive unforced errors to fall behind 3-6. On Safinas sixth set point, she skipped a backhand off the baseline for a winner to take the 80-minute set and even the match.         
	It was then a sprint to the finish. A dejected Dementieva gave away the final set, committing 15 unforced errors while winning only 14 points.         
	Kanepi, an Estonian playing in her first Grand Slam quarter final, was hurt by her own mistakes, too. She committed 31 unforced errors and lost 16 of 24 points on her second serve.         
	Still, Kanepi took an early lead.         
	Kuznetsova lost serve to fall behind 2-4 when she ended an 11-stroke exchange by putting a forehand into the net.         
	Kanepi went ahead 40-love in the next game, a point from a 5-2 lead, before her game unravelled. Kuznetsova won the next point, a 12-stroke rally, with a forehand winner, and Kanepi dropped the next four points too, all on her miscues, capped by a double-fault on break point.         
	That began a run in which Kuznetsova won five of six games  and 23 of 32 points  to take the first set. She raced to a 5-1 lead in the second set, and after closing out the victory with a forehand winner, she waved a clenched fist as she walked to the net.

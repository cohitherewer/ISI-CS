                                                     The ODI squad has affected the journalists more than us: Dhoni

 - People expect a lot from you and the players carry that burden, says Test vice-captain 
   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
        Mahendra Singh Dhoni
   
	Adelaide: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the ODI and Twenty20 captain, didnt take questions on the ODI squad during an interaction with the media on Tuesday. However, he did speak in his capacity as the Test vice-captain. Later, he briefly spoke to The Telegraph too.
 
	The following are excerpts
 
	On whether hes happy with the ODI squad for the forthcoming tri-series
 
	Weve still got one Test to go and the ODI questions should wait till Melbourne (Team Indias first stop after the Test series) hellip; Youve waited for a couple of days and its a question of a few more days hellip;
 
	On the impression that the preparations for the final Test, from Thursday, have got affected because of the ODI squad
 
	It has affected the journalists more than us because were back at practice and also trained in the morning hellip; Hasnt affected us in any way.
 
	On the squad currently in Australia
 
	This team is enjoying its cricket and thats one of the most important things hellip; Given the pressure on Indian players, its important for us to enjoy the game hellip; Its not only about enjoying your success, but the success of teammates hellip; The teams success is important.
 
	On Australia having put the selection of their ODI squad on hold till after the Test series
 
	But if wed selected on the 29th (after the Test series), then it wouldve taken time for the visas and the Twenty20 International (at the MCG, on February 1) and the first ODI (Brisbane, on February 3) wouldve gone hellip;
 
	On being at a venue where Team India won on the last tour (2003-04)
 
	More than how youve done earlier, what matters is how you play over the five days hellip; Its about how many consecutive sessions you play well hellip; We won in Perth, but have to start from scratch here. The Perth win has, of course, given us lots of confidence hellip; The bowlers know the areas theyve got to bowl hellip; If you look at the statistics, yes, weve done well at the Adelaide Oval and the wicket helps spinners.
 
	On whether it will be a moral victory if we win the Test and draw the series
 
	It will be hellip; Coming to Australia and not allowing them to beat us hellip; Giving them a tough fight hellip; Yes, it will be a moral victory. It will be good for morale and good for every player whos in the team.
 
	On having curbed his natural instincts in the second innings at the Waca
 
	Youve got to look at the lines they bowl hellip; Generally, apart from Stuart Clark, they tend to bowl quite outside the off to me hellip; Once youre in, initially, you dont want to chase balls that are outside the off hellip; I followed that in England (last summer) and did well hellip; Im sticking to that... Its about playing according to the situation and its about partnerships hellip; If you get out (cheaply), then its said that you dont have the technique.
 
	On keeping at the Waca
 
	They said it wasnt the normal Perth wicket, but it had more bounce and pace than the MCG and the SCG hellip; Hopefully, the wicket here will have more bounce than in the first two Tests.
 
	On keeping in Australia
 
	Theres more bounce (than in the subcontinent) and you get more time to react to the nicks hellip; Thats because the distance between you and the stumps is greater.
 
	On keeping to spinners
 
	The more you keep, the better hellip; Over the years, if you see, Anil (Kumble) has been so consistent that he makes the batsmen play hellip; So, one is just behind the stumps to take the one ball that can make the difference.
 
	On Rudra Pratap Singh, Irfan Pathan and Ishant Sharma
 
	Theyre swinging the ball hellip; The Australians play fast bowlers well and you can only trouble them with swing. Bowling in the right areas is critical hellip; Look at the way Ishant bowled (the first spell on the fourth morning) at the Waca hellip; Our bowlers have encouraged the Australians to drive and that has helped hellip;
 
	On playing in Australia
 
	One of the good things is that you get results in every Test hellip; The Australians look to score 3.5-4 runs an over, which is a target for them.
 
	On belying expectations and not getting big scores in the series
 
	Its not about peoples expectations, but about the expectations of the players themselves hellip; What you need to do and what are your own expectations hellip; People expect a lot from you and the players carry that burden hellip; Its not the people who play the game, ultimately its the player who has to face Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson hellip;
 
	On Team India not succumbing to the mental disintegration tactics often employed by the Australians
 
	I believe in playing good cricket, thats it hellip; If you look at our team, quite a few of the guys have played for a number of years and they arent bothered about whats being said in the media hellip; They do the things that need to be done and look to be consistent.
 
	On the possibility of fielding five bowlers at the Adelaide Oval
 
	Its always a pleasure to have five bowlers, but youve got to look at many things hellip; By playing five youll be sacrificing one batsman hellip; How the batsmen are playing comes into play hellip; Am I thinking about five bowlers here? Yes.
 
	On being vice-captain to Kumble
 
	One has learnt quite a few things hellip; Communication is important and, so, there shouldnt be any communication gap between the players and the captain hellip; He has a clear mindset hellip; Hes loud and clear about what needs to be done hellip; As for the strategies, hes been playing for 18 years and is good at them hellip; Hes handled the controversies pretty well. Hopefully, I wont have to deal with controversies. Who wants to deal with them?
 
	On the vice-captaincy being part of his learning curve
 
	Its not only about learning from Anil hellip; If you see the former captains weve got hellip; Sourav Ganguly, one of the greatest hellip; Sachin Tendulkar hellip; Rahul Dravid hellip; Virender Sehwag is also there hellip; The number of games these guys have played hellip; Its not that one has to learn from captains only hellip; Look at Yuvraj Singh, hes played nearly 200 ODIs hellip; Its important to take in what they think of the game in certain situations hellip; Helps when youre about to take a crucial decision hellip; It comes down to how open minded you are and how well you can take the opinion of others.
 
	On whether he believes in captaining by consensus
 
	(Smiles) I believe in instinct and go with it hellip; If I sense that the ball could go in a particular direction, then Ill have a fielder there hellip; But its not that I dont plan for things and make it (the strategy) very clear to the bowlers hellip; Ultimately, theyve got to bowl according to the field.
 
	Finally, on whether the fourth-day finish at the Waca gave him the opportunity to interact with his Perth-based idol, Adam Gilchrist
 
	Briefly, when he came over to our dressing room after the Test hellip; I intend having a detailed chat at some point during the tri-series.

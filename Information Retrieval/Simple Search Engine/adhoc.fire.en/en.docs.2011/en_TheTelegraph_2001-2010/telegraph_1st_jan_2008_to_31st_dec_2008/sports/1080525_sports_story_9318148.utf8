The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Theres always something more to do in this world: Shah Rukh
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Theres always something more to do in this world: Shah Rukh
    - I try and enjoy every minute of life, says Bollywood megastar             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Shah Rukh Khan                                 
	Calcutta: Sunday will mark the formal end of the Kolkata Knight Riders campaign in the Indian Premier Leagues inaugural edition. It will also mark owner Shah Rukh Khans last visit to the city in connection with the 2008 League.         
	A common sentiment, of course, is that the Knight Riders wouldve fared much better had some of Shah Rukhs passion rubbed off on them. Whatever, any improvement can only be made and seen next year.         
	Its to be seen whether Shah Rukh, who believes perfection is not attainable by anyone, cracks the whip. And, if so, to what extent. Till thats known, one can reflect on his thoughts on matters of a general kind  conveyed to The Telegraph during a recent one-on-one.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His role model         
	Nobody, really... I got very influenced by my parents (Taj Mohammed and Lateef Fatima) and then quickly moved into the real world... Ive just remembered what my parents were like... Now, even that memory is fading, but I remember the things they taught me... Fortunately, my mind has retained those qualities without my actually trying to remember them. I do try and follow their principles...         
	Whether, being an icon, hes conscious about doing certain things and not doing certain things on the screen         
	Im comfortable, say, with smoking... But, yes, I dont think I should use bad language in a film... Thats because kids catch on to such things... Theyll (still) learn, but I dont want to be the one who taught them.         
	Bad language featuring in the script of a film         
	I dont change scripts, I simply dont do such films... Ill give some reason and tell the producer/director that I dont want to be a part of it... Obviously, if the words are there, then the film demands it, and a lot of people wouldnt like to lose a Shah Rukh Khan for a few bad words... But I dont make them unhappy by saying Im not doing the film because of those words.         
	Whether hes particular about scenes         
	Theres definitely a level of decency that I like to maintain with women... I dont cross limits... I did it in Anjaam, because I was a mad man, but Id refrain from beating up a woman... Also, I wont make fun of disabled people... Im very aware of all this.         
	Not keeping cigarettes out of the public eye         
	Its each one to his own on smoking and drinking... I think times have changed and those times have gone when people copied the actions of others...         
	Approach to life and work         
	Work till you drop dead! Be a sport...         
	Being a dreamer         
	I am one... Sometimes I dream of the studio that Ive made, but I dont even have the land as yet! But I dream of having shot a film in that studio... God has been kind and most of the dreams have come true.         
	Money         
	I dont count the money that I earn, but I ask the accountant whether we have the finances... If he says no, then I dont borrow... I just go and do some job... I didnt find it odd when I danced at weddings... Im an actor, Im a dancer... I can do anything that a performer can... Im hoping to perfect my art... Ive learnt my art from people like Raghubir Yadav and Barry John... Im Shah Rukh Khan because of what I do.         
	Being passionate about         
	Life... Everything... Its not about how I get the energy, I try and enjoy every minute...         
	Entertainment today         
	Weve reached the economy of entertainment... Theres entertainment everywhere... In the malls... Everywhere... If Hrithik Roshan has to dance for the Mumbai Indians, thats entertainment... If cricketers need to attend a function and talk in a cool manner, thats entertainment... Today, everybody, from the CEO of an oil company to an actor like me is an entertainer.         
	Involvement with the Knight Riders         
	Im more a team member rather than an owner... Thats how I see it.         
	Being addicted, so to say, to sports channels         
	Yeah... I even watch some strange soccer and hockey matches... In soccer, it could be a match featuring two of the bottom-ranked teams in some league... But, then, I love sports... I dont watch car races, though, they really dont turn me on.         
	Finally, on how would he like to be remembered         
	(Laughs) As one who tried his best and then died... But, at least, tried... I used to love the motto in school  Do your best and leave the rest... Theres no point in having a jeet, because that ends it... My belief is that theres always something more to do in this world... Today, I can retire.... Ive achieved a lot and can rest on those laurels... But the laurels are a thing of the past... Theyve already been achieved... So, I keep trying for something new... Maybe, Ill achieve that one laurel that I couldnt so far...

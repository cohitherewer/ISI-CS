	Calcutta: Bengal thumped hapless Services by an innings and 226 runs with almost a day and a half to spare in their Ranji Trophy plate group B match at the Eden on Monday to pick up six crucial points which included a bonus.         
	Bengal pacers Ashok Dinda (4/28) and Ranadeb Bose (3/34) shared seven wickets among themselves to shot out the visitors for a paltry 109 in the second essay after captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla declared Bengals first innings at the overnight score of 442 for six.         
	The hosts, who will face Tripura at the Eden from November 29, now have seven points from two outings.         
	Services chances of any fight-back were nipped in the bud by Ranadebs opening spell (7-4-12-3). The lanky right-arm medium pacer utilised the well-known conditions superbly to leave Services reeling.         
	Operating from the High Court end, the pacer struck in the very sixth ball of the day, removing Services captain Sumit Tomar (0), who edged it to Manoj Tiwary at first slip.         
	Ranadeb made the ball move both ways and picked up Jasvir Singh in his next over (the third over of the match). Jasvir, the highest scorer for Services in the first innings with 27, had no answer when Ranadebs in-swinger uprooted his stumps.         
	The sturdy Yashpal Singh walked in next and was caught plumb in front to an in-cutter from Ranadeb.         
	Inspired by his partners lethal spell, Dinda too started picking up wickets from the other end. With his superb line and length, the pacer first caught Tahir Khan (15), the other opener, leg before in the sixth over and then removed Soomik Chatterjee (6) in the eighth over to reduce the visitors to 31 for five.         
	As the day progressed, the early morning moisture at Eden started evaporating and left-hander Devendra Ishrani (40) and wicketkeeper Sarabjit Singh (7) managed to put up a brief resistance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nicklaus pays a flying visit
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nicklaus pays a flying visit

	The umbrellas were being blown inside out again at Birkdale on Friday, although the sudden gust which blew a few hats off around mid-morning had more to do with the private plane flying over at about 150 feet. Jack Nicklaus may not play much golf nowadays, but he still thinks it, and he probably told the pilot that he had to keep it low into the wind.         
	Nicklaus was making the briefest of visits (he was back having dinner in America Friday night) in an ambassadorial role for the Royal Bank of Scotland, so it was appropriate enough to find him autographing some of those five pounds with his head on it which were specially minted to commemorate his farewell Open appearance at St Andrews in 2005.         
	He hardly plays now, as social golf was never likely to be high on his agenda, and clearing the hips on the downswing is a little trickier when one is artificial. Hard though it is to believe, though, he remains  at 68  the only serious rival to Tiger Woods.         
	Nicklaus was forever involved in duels, firstly with Arnold Palmer, then Gary Player, then Lee Trevino, and perhaps most of all, with Tom Watson. Woods, though, is duelling with no one but himself, and without any serious contenders for his No. 1 ranking, his sole motivation remains Nicklauss record of 18 major championships.         
	I suppose you could say that Tigers main rivalry is me and my record, he said. Thats his motivation, and hes so strong he doesnt really need anything else. But it would be so good for the game if he had one or two guys coming along to really push him.         
	So is Nicklaus at all happy that Woods, who has 14 majors, will make no further inroads towards Jacks tally this year? Apparently not. I would never be pleased to see Tiger not go after my record because of health issues. I even gave him the name of a real top hip specialist who worked with me many years ago although whether he ever called him up I dont know.         
	Nicklaus puts the absence of serious challengers to the Woods hegemony down to modern golfs comfort zone. Finishing 20th, or whatever, is enough to make a very good living nowadays, whereas when I played, you had to be a winner to create a name to make a living out of endorsements and sponsorship. Now you can do it purely off prize money, and there is no real requirement to gut it out.         
	He looks well for his age, but his figure betrays the fact that he does a lot of these lunches, and hes got more grandchildren than Birkdale has holes. And yet hes still the only man Woods might not be able to beat.

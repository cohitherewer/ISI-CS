	Melbourne: Kimi Raikkonen and Lewis Hamilton renewed their rivalry on Friday with pace-setting performances in the two practice sessions for Formula Ones Australian season-opener.         
	Ferraris Raikkonen, limbering up for his first race as world champion, laid down an early marker for Sundays grand prix with a one minute 26.461 second lap that topped the morning timesheets at Albert Park.         
	But the Finn was less happy with his cars set-up in the afternoon, when Hamilton was quickest.         
	Im not very happy with the way practice went, he said. This morning we found some good settings for the car but in the afternoon we struggled and our lap times reflect that. We must look carefully at the data to work out how to improve the car.         
	Raikkonen won in Melbourne last year on his Ferrari debut and the Finn will be chasing a third successive victory after ending 2007 on a high with triumphs in China and Brazil taking him to the title by a single point.         
	Hamilton, the 23-year-old who missed out on the 2007 title by a single point after a stunning debut season with McLaren, was more positive.         
	There was some good progress with the car and we made the best use of the ever-improving track conditions, said the Briton.         
	His lap of 1:26.559, in 36 degree Celsius heat and under a cloudless sky, ousted Red Bulls Australian Mark Webber from the top spot.         
	Ferrari and McLaren, between them winners of every race last year, dominated the field in the first session but the pecking order was shaken up by Red Bulls strong showing after lunch.         
	Webber, who was a considerable 0.914 off Hamiltons time, cautioned his home fans against expecting too much however after a session that saw cars running with different fuel levels.         
	Were not second quickest, were still fighting for the back of the points, he said.         
	Ferraris Felipe Massa and McLarens Heikki Kovalainen were third and fourth fastest, respectively, in both sessions.         
	Spains double world champion Fernando Alonso, who has returned to Renault after a bitter and tumultuous year alongside Hamilton at McLaren, was sixth in the morning but 13th in the second stint and complained of gusting winds.         
	We must still find some performance but I am optimistic for the rest of the weekend, he said.         
	The top 10 highlighted the fierce fight behind Ferrari and McLaren, with seven teams jostling for position.         
	Polands Robert Kubica was seventh fastest for BMW in the morning, ahead of Toyotas German rookie Timo Glock and compatriot Sebastian Vettel in a Toro Rosso.         
	Italian Giancarlo Fisichella, a winner in Australia with Renault in 2005, showed Force India were likely to be more serious contenders than predecessors Spyker with ninth place in the afternoon after 12th place earlier on.               
	Toyota-powered Williams, whose pre-season testing times were impressive, made a troubled start with Germanys Nico Rosberg failing to register a timed lap in the morning before lapping eighth fastest in the second session.         
	The first session was halted for four minutes after Brazilian rookie Nelson Piquet Jr spun and stalled on the track.         
	Force India owner Vijay Mallya hailed Fisichella on Friday after the Italian driver broke into the top 10.         
	We said that Force India would make steady progress and I think we demonstrated it today, the Indian billionaire, who bought the Spyker team last October and renamed it, said. A lot of work has gone in during the winter and the tests that we did over the winter period have taught us a lot, he added.         
	Giancarlo Fisichella has been a tremendous addition to the team, his feedback has certainly helped the engineers accelerate the development of the car and the set-up, said Mallya of the Italian, who won with Renault in Melbourne in 2005.         
	So overall the package is looking much, much better and its showing in the timings.         
	How much further we can go is a matter of time...but over the course of the year Im still confident that we will make improvement, added the Indian. We are going the right way and Im delighted about it.         
	Spyker scored just one point last year while predecessors Midland drew a complete blank in 2006 after buying the Silverstone-based team founded by Irish entrepreneur Eddie Jordan.         
	Ferrari-powered Force India recruited Fisichella, a race winner with Jordan in 2003, for his experience late last year and have been assured a far bigger budget by Mallya.         
	The Indian said before the start of the season that he hoped the team could reach the second phase of qualifying and Fridays showing suggested that was no wild dream.         
	I had set a target of Q2 during the mid-season of 2008. If we can get it done in the first race, nothing would make me happier, he said. (Reuters)

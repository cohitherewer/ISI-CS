The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky: I was asked to drop charges 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ricky: I was asked to drop charges 
                      
	Melbourne: Australia skipper Ricky Ponting is all set to kick up a fresh storm with claims that a senior member of the Indian team asked him to drop the charges of racial abuse against Harbhajan Singh during the bitter Sydney Test row earlier this year.         
	On the night after we made our on-field report about Harbhajan, I had a phone conversation with a senior member of the Indian touring party, who asked me straight to drop the complaint, Ponting reveals in his just-released book Captains Diary 2008, extracts of which came out in a local daily on Saturday.         
	Harbhajan was accused of racially abusing Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds by calling him a monkey during the infamous Sydney Test.         
	Ponting, without revealing the name of the player who called him, goes on to say that the senior Indian cricketer tried to convince him about the futility of pursuing the long legal battle that would come with such a serious charge.         
	Ponting alleges that once he ignored the call, he witnessed heightened activity in the Indian camp to get the charges downgraded. The Indians had threatened to pull out of the acrimonious tour at one stage.         
	I was determined to see that justice would be done, but I knew from the moment I put my mobile back in my pocket that the investigation might not be as straightforward as the authorities hearing the evidence, making the right decision and then we all move on, he says.         
	Meanwhile, Symonds, in his book Roy on the Rise: A Year of Living Dangerously, co-authored with Stephen Gray, has claimed that he was sure of Harbhajan first calling him monkey in Mumbai last year.         
	Symonds says after the Sydney episode, he contemplated quitting the game.         
	By the end of the season, I didnt want to see another cricket ball or bat. I had had enough  I was physically tired and mentally worn down, he writes.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Albie Sachs to hear Gambhir appeal
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Albie Sachs to hear Gambhir appeal
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday appointed Justice Albie Sachs of South Africa as the commissioner to hear Gautam Gambhirs appeal against the one-Test ban. It may be recalled that Justice Sachs had been sympathetic towards Sourav Ganguly in July 2005.         
	Sachs, who was then the arbiter, had reduced the former Indian captains six-ODI ban  for his bowlers being three overs short  by one-third.         
	Gambhir can play in the fourth and final Test against Australia pending decision.         
	Justice Albie Sachs has been appointed to hear the appeal of Gautam Gambhir against the finding that the India opener was guilty of conduct contrary to the Spirit of Cricket during the third Test against Australia in New Delhi, an ICC release said.         
	Justice Sachs is a senior judge on the Constitutional Court of South Africa, and is Cricket South Africas appointment on the ICC Code of Conduct Commission.         
	Gambhir was banned by Match Referee Chris Broad on Friday after he pleaded guilty to a charge under Rule C1 of the Code, Level 2, which states that players shall, at all times, conduct play within the spirit of the game.         
	The incident that led to the charge being laid took place during the 51st over of Indias first innings on day one of the Test match when Gambhir was going for a couple of runs.         
	The charges were laid by on-field umpires Billy Bowden and Aleem Dar and third umpire Suresh Shastri.         
	The ICC received official notification of the appeal from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Friday and the ICC Head of Legal David Becker appointed Justice Sachs later the same evening in accordance with ICC Code of Conduct processes, the release added.         
	Incidentally, the ICC Executive Board recently approved an amendment to the Code of Conduct to the effect that a player who is unsuccessful with his appeal shall have to bear the costs of that appeal.         
	In July 2005, Broad had slapped a six-ODI ban on Sourav. The former Indian captain was made to pay for the bowlers being three overs short. But the BCCI challenged the decision and the ICC appointed Justice Sachs to hear Souravs appeal against the ban.         
	The Judge heard Souravs appeal and taking a sympathetic stance, recommended that the ban be reduced by one-third.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak coach talks tough
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pak coach talks tough
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan cricket coach Geoff Lawson feels an artificially imposed system of hierarchy coupled with complacency among some senior players has been the major reason for the teams inconsistent form.         
	Asked what he thought needed to be improved in the team at this point of time, Lawson quipped: Oh well, there are a couple of senior players who, really are legends in their own country, who sometimes dont train as hard as they should and sometimes, when the game gets in a pressure situation, they dont actually perform.         
	Lawson said he has been trying to get rid of the hierarchy system in the team.         
	...The hierarchy they had was one, you know the junior players arent considered, selection is made on an ad hoc basis rather than having a process and a structure and as a foreigner you look at the team and you say, well who is this guy playing this week? Never heard of him.         
	Well I suppose anyone can break a contract. But thats not my intention,  you know Ive got definite aims about what the Pakistan cricket team need to do and how well get there. So that, I mean, that really drives me at the moment. he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Milkha tied fifth
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev Milkha tied fifth
                      
	Paris: The unlucky 13th hole gobbled up two shots but Jeev Milkha Singh rode a flawless front nine to soar to tied fifth after an opening round of three-under 68 in the Open de France Alstom.         
	Compatriot Jyoti Randhawas round of 70 had him at tied 28th, even though S.S.P. Chowrasia and Shiv Kapur had teething problems and after their identical rounds of 75, both would need vastly improved show in the second round if they are to hang around for weekend action.         
	Bank Austria winner Jeev had a good start to his campaign and thanks to his bogey-free front nine, in which he reeled off three birdies. Jeev approached the 13th hole at four-under only to drop a double bogey there. The birdie on the 15th reduced the damage and Jeevs card was impressive enough to hang on among the top five.         
	Spaniard Pablo Larrazabal blasted 65 to grab the opening round lead, ahead of Oliver Fisher and Peter Lawrie who returned 66 apiece. (PTI)

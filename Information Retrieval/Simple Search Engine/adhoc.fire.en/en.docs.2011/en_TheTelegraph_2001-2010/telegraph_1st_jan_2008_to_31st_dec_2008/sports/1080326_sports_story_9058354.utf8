The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Cromwell may come good
                                                                                                               Cromwell may come good 
            STAR RACER                                
	Calcutta: Five of the eight horses are closely handicapped to win the Prince Pradeep Cup, Wednesdays main event.          
	Oxford Street heads the scales at 61kg, yet Vijay Singhs ward cannot be ignored because of his poor third last time out. Cromwell and Diomedes too performed poorly in their previous outings. However, they are well in at the weights. Cosmos, on the other hand, has been knocking at the door while Mustang Royal is capable of surprising again after his stunning victory. All things considered, the Robin Corner-trained Cromwell appears to have the best credential to win the trophy.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

                                                                                                                                                                                           Dhonis turn to get stumped!
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                
	Karachi: Mahendra Singh Dhoni is used to stumping. Indias ODI (and Twenty20) captain, though, himself got somewhat stumped on Sunday afternoon.         
	Mr Dhoni, can I have a photograph with you? asked one of the locals as the captain was crossing the Pearl Continental lobby and moving towards the Marco Polo restaurant.         
	Dhoni obliged. Unusually, however, the local thanked him (in The Telegraphs presence) by saying: Mr Dhoni, youre very smart in real life, but dont look that smart on the TV!         
	Recovering quickly, Dhoni responded: TV mein aap mujhe khali cricket khelte dekhte hain...         
	It was the locals turn to get stumped.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who suffered a stroke on October 12 and has been unconscious since, is set to become the president of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for the sixth consecutive four-year term.         
	According to sources, five state associations have proposed Das Munshis name for the post of president in the AIFF elections to be held on December 23. Since no other nomination has been filed for the post, Das Munshi will be elected unopposed.         
	Initially, we planned to keep the post of president vacant till Das Munshi got well, a source said. But the move would have created a constitutional crisis.         
	The nomination for Das Munshi was only filed after the returning officer for the elections, Harish Sharma, pointed out that according to the AIFF constitution, the election of a president is a necessity.         
	After Mr Sharma pointed out the constitutional obligation, five state associations proposed the name of Mr. Das Munshi, the source said.         
	We have also taken the permission of Das Munshis family members before proposing his name as the president, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea bask in Hilarious show 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chelsea bask in Hilarious show 
            JOHN LEY                                   Liverpool rsquo;s Steven Gerrard (right) celebrates with John Arne Riise after scoring against Arsenal at Anfield on Tuesday		    
	Where the Special One failed, the Normal One must succeed. A night of nerves ended with Chelsea reaching their fourth Champions League semi-final in five years and third against Liverpool. Now, Avram Grant is charged with overcoming Rafael Benitezs team and delivering Chelsea into a final that so painfully eluded Jose Mourinho in his three years at Stamford Bridge.         
	Goals at either end of this fractious, yet compelling, tie from Michael Ballack and Frank Lampard, presented Chelsea with another opportunity to achieve what is their Holy Grail. After two taut and tense Champions League tussles with Liverpool, in 2005 and last year, they must succeed where they previously failed if Roman Abramovich is to fulfil his dream of seeing his club run out in Moscow in May.         
	For once, the advantage is with the blue corner. In the previous two semi-finals against Liverpool, the Reds had home advantage in the second leg. This time it is Chelsea who will enjoy that benefit, the first instalment at Anfield on April 22. The return is at Stamford Bridge, on April 30, with the little matter of the Premier League visit of Manchester United in between; in nine days the future of Grant and Chelsea can be determined.         
	Going into the tie, Chelsea were trailing for the 11th time in their European history. The fact that, for the seventh time, they have overturned that deficit says much for their character and determination.         
	The victory was achieved with Hilario, Chelseas third-choice goalkeeper, unexpectedly thrust into the fray. With Petr Cech watching with a face full of stitches after a training-ground accident, Carlo Cudicini was again called upon but the game was just 25 minutes old when the Italian limped off, a pulled hamstring ending his involvement.         
	That meant Hilario was required and after a nervous start, the Portuguese made two late saves that pierced the heart of Fenerbahce and led to the second, deciding goal.         
	Until then, Chelsea had to rely on Michael Ballacks fourth-minute goal. For the next 83 minutes Chelsea lived on their nerves, squandering chances and offering Fenerbahce a route back. But, after Hilarios saves, Chelsea counter-attacked and Lampards goal acted as the perfect antidote to their anxiety.         
	Ballack had warned, a day earlier, of the importance of starting well and the German did not disappoint. His glancing header from Lampards free-kick so perfectly placed that Volkan Demirel was left motionless on his goal-line.         
	The end was both nervous and entertaining. In the 82nd minute Gokhan Gonul prodded the ball forward and Hilario had to dive to his right to save. Then the Portuguese made another tremendous save, from Colin Kazim-Richards.         
	Before the end Michael Essien was cautioned and will miss the semi-final first leg.

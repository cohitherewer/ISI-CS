	Monte Carlo: Lewis Hamilton overcame an early accident and wet conditions on Sunday to win the Monaco Grand Prix and take the lead in the Formula One championship.         
	The McLaren driver, who started third on the grid, finished three seconds ahead of BMW Saubers Robert Kubica while pole sitter Felipe Massa of Ferrari was third at Formula Ones most famous race.         
	That was a fantastic job as always, a pumped-up Hamilton said to his team over the radio. I apologise for hitting the barrier. Lets go party tonight.         
	The 23-year-old Briton swiped the wall early on but took advantage of Massas mistake on the slick street circuit to earn his sixth career win.         
	Massa, starting from pole, ran off the track 25 laps in to lose the lead with Hamilton able to make up the difference.         
	Hamilton improved to 38 points in the overall standings, three better than defending world champion Kimi Raikkonen, who finished out of the points in ninth. The Ferrari drivers poor day began with a drive-through penalty and culminated with an accident involving Force India driver Adrian Sutil.         
	Massa is third with 34 points and Kubica next on 32.         
	Hamilton hung on despite seeing a 40-second advantage erased with 20 minutes remaining when the safety car emerged after Nico Rosberg of Williams crashed.         
	Red Bulls Mark Webber was fourth ahead of Sebastian Vettel of Toro Rosso. Rubens Barichello of Honda, Kazuki Nakajima of Williams and Heikki Kovalainen rounded out the places in the points.         
	The morning rain came and went as drivers took on the tight street circuit without the banned driver aids that help improve traction control.         
	Kovalainen, fourth on the grid, had to start last after stalling before the formation lap. Hamilton was sandwiched between the Ferraris after moving ahead of Raikkonen in a clean start for the 20-car field.         
	Showers picked up and shooting spray had lap times nearly 20 seconds off of Saturdays qualifying and Hamilton pitted six laps in after his right rear tire brushed the wall.         
	David Coulthard lost control of his Red Bull car for the second straight day to crash out before Toro Rossos Sebastien Bourdais reared into him to bring out the safety car for the first time.

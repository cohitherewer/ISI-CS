The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United SC suffer loss, injury
                                                                                                                                                                                                     United SC suffer loss, injury
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: United SC came here with the aim of scoring a Mumbai double but would return home with insult and injury after an agonising 1-0 loss to Air India in a fourth round clash of the I-League football at the Cooperage on Sunday.         
	A terrible goal-keeping blunder by Arindam Ghosh  who came on for Robikanta Singh who suffered a knee injury in the first half  saw him completely beaten by Uttam Singhs throw and Surojit Roy made no mistake in tapping it in to give the hosts their all-winning goal in the 70 th minute.         
	Robikanta seemed to have suffered a ligament injury when he leaped over rival captain Emmanuel Ovieghara to collect the ball in the 32 nd minute.         
	United were actually lucky on that occasion since Ovieghara, making the most of Robikantas trouble, put the ball into the net, however to the hosts surprise, referee A. Rowan disallowed the goal.         
	Nevertheless, it was joy for Air India since the win kept their unbeaten run.         
	Air India now have eight points and are placed second in the standings.         
	Sporting Clube de Goa and Mumbai FC share the top spot with nine points each. Both have yet to play their fourth match.         
	United coach Subrata Bhattacharjee, on the other hand, was a distraught man.         
	Which injury should I talk about? There were many, the heart is also wounded, he said.         
	The coach, however, admitted to Ghoshs error. He (Ghosh) has always been nervous. He played against East Bengal, even then he conceded all the three goals, Bhattacharjee said.         
	The refereeing was the talking point after the match that saw six yellow cards.         
	Here too, Air India were at the receiving end more with Chukwoma Udofia getting a double booking and being ruled out of their next match, away to Dempo SC.         
	It was ironic since Udofia had played a crucial role and was declared the Man of the Match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Uthappa looks to cement berth
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Uthappa looks to cement berth
                      
	Kochi: After floating in the top and middle orders for quite a while, Robin Uthappa is now desperate for a permanent slot in the One Day international lineup, which he believes would facilitate his Test inclusion as well.         
	Uthappa said although he has earned his stripes as an attacking batsman, he had the requisite patience and technique to break into the Test team as well and he was aiming to make the cut by next season.         
	In one-day matches I was batting up and down the order. I did not get a regular spot If I could get a regular spot, hopefully I will perform well and get into the longer version of the game, the batsman of the Mumbai Indians team of Indian Premier League said. I am hoping that I will get my chance by the end of this year or probably the next season, he said.         
	Uthappa agrees Test cricket poses altogether a new challenge but believes that he would need only minor adjustments to fit into the format.         
	Test cricket is a different ball game and the only thing you have to make are some minor adjustments in your shot selection. If one is able to chose his shot selection, nothing prevents him from performing in Test cricket, added Uthappa.         
	He dismissed suggestion that he was too attacking for the longer version of the game and cited the example of hard-hitting Australian duo of Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden.

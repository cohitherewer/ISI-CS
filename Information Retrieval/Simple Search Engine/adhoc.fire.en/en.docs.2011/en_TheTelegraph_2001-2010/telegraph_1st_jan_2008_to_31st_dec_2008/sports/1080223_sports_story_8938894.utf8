The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No racism in Spain: Alonso 
                                                     No racism in Spain: Alonso 
          
	Fernando Alonso has insisted Spain is not a racist country in the wake of the abuse former McLaren teammate Lewis Hamilton suffered there. The Oviedo-born driver also believes there is no need for the anti-racism campaign due to be launched at Aprils Spanish Grand Prix by motor racings world governing body, the FIA.         
	Alonsos comments stem from an incident during a recent test session in Barcelona, when Hamilton was targeted by a small number of spectators. Widespread condemnation followed, with the FIA insisting they were appalled by the ugly scenes that unfolded at the Circuit de Catalunya.         
	I dont think this is a racist country and the fans arent either, Alonso said. The less we talk about what happened 15 days ago, the better, because thats a completely isolated case. I havent seen any video or recording of the alleged insults.         
	When asked if an anti-racism campaign was necessary, Alonso said: No. It was an isolated incident.         
	Back on the track, the Spaniard reckons he has little chance of stepping on to the podium after returning to Renault. Thinking coldly, reaching the podium is a dream. In our current shape, it will be hard to make it into Q3, he added.

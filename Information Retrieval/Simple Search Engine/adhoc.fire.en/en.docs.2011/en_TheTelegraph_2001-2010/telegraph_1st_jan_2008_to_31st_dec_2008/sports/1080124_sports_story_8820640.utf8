                                                    Covered wicket upsets India plans

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
      Dinesh Karthik, who has been included in the XII for the final Test, at practice in Adelaide 
             
	Adelaide: In whats seen as a tactical move by the hosts, Anil Kumble and Co. couldnt have a look at the Adelaide Oval wicket on Wednesday as it was covered. 
    
	And, so, the XI couldnt be finalised during the team meeting on the eve of the fourth and final 3mobile Test. On Tuesday, the wicket had a covering of grass. 
    
	Down 1-2, the Indians must win if the series is to be drawn. 
    
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the think tank named Dinesh Karthik in the XII, with Wasim Jaffer being dropped. 
    
	Karthik wont have a role if Harbhajan Singh becomes the fifth bowler. In that case, either Rahul Dravid or even Irfan Pathan will open with Virender Sehwag. 
    
	Team India, of course, pulled off a brilliant win the last time we played here  in 2003-04. 
    
	Sourav Ganguly, who was then the captain, said: The quality of our all-round cricket made the difference... To do as well, this time, well need runs on the board...

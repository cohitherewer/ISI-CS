                                                     Sad state of affairs in Indian tennis

	The recent happenings in tennis have stirred a hornets nest. The revolt in the Davis Cup team is a matter of serious concern. First, captain Leander Paes traded fire with old friend Mahesh Bhupathi through statements to the press against Prakash Amritraj.         
	Then, the rebels hoisted their flag with a letter to the All India Tennis Association (AITA) signed by Amritraj, Bopanna, Bhupathi and Karan Rastogi, stating that they would not play in the Davis Cup if Paes was the captain. It was a sad day and unprecedented in the history of Indian tennis.         
	I would like to put in proper perspective the events that led to the revolt. Paes announced at a press conference that since Prakash was not well, he was nominating Somdev Dev Varman for the opening singles and that Prakash would be played on the third day in the fifth match by which time he would have recovered fully.         
	When queried by the press, Prakash contradicted Paes and said that he was 100% fit and ready to play. This upset Paes who then told the reporters that Prakash had been partying and had picked up a stomach bug and was throwing up and having loose motions, which he regarded as a totally unprofessional conduct.         
	Dr. Vece Paes, the team doctor, also confirmed that on Tuesday February 5, three days before the tie, Prakash had been unwell, with a severe stomach infection. It took Dr. Paes two days to control the infection and he confirmed that in no way was Prakash going to be fit for the first singles on Friday, February 8.         
	Then Bhupathi stepped into the fray and told the press that Paes comments were uncalled for as Prakash had only gone to a birthday party and there was nothing wrong with that.         
	This indisciplined comment by Bhupathi against the captain added fuel to the controversy. As a senior experienced member of the team, Bhupathi, in the national interest, should have made an effort to patch-up the differences in the team before the tie. Instead, he chose to have a go at Paes and sowed the seed of the revolt.         
	Without Bhupathis support the youngsters would not have had the courage to write such a letter. One wonders why Bhupathi signed the letter. His interaction with Paes was nil and he was not in any way affected by Paes captaincy.         
	The fact that Rastogi who was not in the squad, was asked to sign the letter to the AITA, smacks of a ganging-up not much short of blackmail. How sad.         
	The letter to the AITA from Prakash, Bopanna, Bhupathi and Rastogi said that they had lost faith in Paes as a captain because he did not select Prakash for the first match, they were uncomfortable with Paes in the captains chair, that they did not like the down-talking to the Press about the players and also because he was always late.         
	Losing faith in the captain for not selecting Prakash who was recovering from a Delhi Belly is laughable. Judgement of Paes contribution in the captains chair by Prakash and Rohan who have played a paltry 15 and 17 matches each in the Davis Cup against Paes 111 matches in 43 ties is also difficult to accept.         
	 The captain has the right to nominate whoever he likes considering all aspects of the tie. He is not answerable to anyone. Isnt it enough that India won the tie against Uzbekistan?         
	AITA secretary Anil Khanna has handled the unfortunate incident with aplomb and dignity. One hopes that the AITA will take a firm stand in the matter.

	New Delhi: Top Indian shuttlers Anup Sridhar and Chetan Anand crashed out in the first round of mens singles in the Asian Championship in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, on Wednesday.    
	While Sridhar lost 9-21, 13-21 to seventh seeded Sung Hwan Park of Korea, Chetan lost 19-21, 24-26 to Hiroyuki Endo of Japan.    
	The loss virtually ended world No. 47 Anands chances of making it to the Beijing Olympics. Sridhar though still has a chance as he is ranked 24th in the world and top 38 in the May 1 rankings list get automatic qualification.

	London: German Formula One driver Sebastian Vettel is likely to switch to Red Bull Racing from smaller sister team Toro Rosso next year, according to Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pele hits out at Fifa chief
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pele hits out at Fifa chief
                      
	Stoke: Football great Pele denounced Fifa president Sepp Blatters belief that some top players are treated like slaves by their clubs.         
	Blatter was giving his assessment of Cristiano Ronaldos standoff with Manchester United over a move to Real Madrid when he said that players seeking a transfer should be allowed to leave.         
	The top-earning Portugal winger concurred with Blatters modern slavery comments, which upset footballs first black superstar.         
	You are a slave if you work without a contract or you dont get paid, said Pele, a three-time World Cup winner with Brazil, which abolished slavery 120 years ago.         
	If you have a contract then in any job you got to finish the contract. I think when he finishes his contract, then he should be free to go wherever he wants to.         
	Ronaldo has almost four years left on his Old Trafford contract and while no transfer request has been submitted, the 23-year-old English footballer of the year has spent the summer angling for a transfer to Madrid.         
	Pele said all these at a charity match in aid of former England goalkeeper Gordon Banks foundation.           (AP)

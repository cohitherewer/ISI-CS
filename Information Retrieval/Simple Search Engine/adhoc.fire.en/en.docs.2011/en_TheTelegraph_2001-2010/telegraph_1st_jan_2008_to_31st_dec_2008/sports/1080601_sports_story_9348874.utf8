The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John: Rickys amazing
                                                                                                                                                                                                       John: Rickys amazing
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ricky Ponting                           
	Calcutta: Friday saw Ricky Ponting enter the most exclusive of clubs for batters  qualification being a minimum of 10,000 Test runs.         
	Hes only the seventh member, in fact.         
	Its a huge achievement for Australias captain, one lauded with a touch of emotion by former coach John Buchanan.         
	Buchanan, who spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday evening, saluted Ponting in the following manner:         
	Rickys an amazing cricketer and the teams success, Im sure, will please him more Hes not one for personal records but its surely a matter of some debate as to where hell eventually finish I see Ricky (now 33) playing for another two-three years So, youve got to wonder what the final number of his runs will be         
	For all his achievements, Rickys remained much the young kid from Mowbray in Launceston (Tasmania) Enjoys the game, enjoys a laugh Enjoys talking about the game and also enjoys getting away from it Ricky likes his round of golf A kids on the way and, so, that will also be a milestone of sorts         
	The IPL didnt see the best of Ricky, but he was certainly like a breath of fresh air around the Kolkata Knight Riders Yes, Ive read that he used a TV at nets to iron out flaws But, then, thats Ricky Always wanting to improve         
	For whatever reason, in recent times, people have largely been talking of Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar, but Ricky will eventually be recognised as one of the all-time greats From what I know, his (Test) average has got better in the time hes been the captain That, for me, is significant         
	Nobodys going to disagree.

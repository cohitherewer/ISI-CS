                                                   Sachin up to No. 12

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar has risen to his highest Test rankings in two years and is just two spots outside the top-10 in the latest ICC rankings. 
    
	Tendulkars two centuries in four Tests Down Under has pushed him one place up to 12th in the rankings according to a release. 
    
	Virender Sehwag, who scored 63 and 151 in Adelaide, has also gained eight places and is now at 24th place in the batting rankings still headed by Kumar Sangakkara. 
    
	Jacques Kallis is in second place and Michael Hussey in third. Hussey steadily progressed through the rankings during the series with India and is now poised to take top spot if he continues his good form. 
    
	His captain Ricky Ponting retains fourth spot and is moving in the right direction after having returned to form with a century in Adelaide. 
    
	Clarke, who scored 118 in Adelaide, his sixth Test century, is in 11th while Andrew Symonds fell three places and out of the top 20 after a relatively disappointing match with the bat. 
    
	Among the bowlers, Brett Lee has achieved the highest rating of his career to date following the Test series against India and is now in fourth position, fast closing on those bowlers ahead of him. 
    
	India Test captain Anil Kumble retains his sixth spot among bowlers while progressing four places up among allrounders to seventh, his highest career rating to date. The allrounders list is headed by Jacques Kallis. 
    
	With Irfan Pathan currently occupying sixth place, India can boast of two Test allrounders in the top seven.

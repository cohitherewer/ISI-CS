The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CBI to probe Monika case
                                                                                                                                                                                             CBI to probe Monika case
                    Monika Devi                
	New Delhi: The CBI has launched an enquiry into allegations by weightlifter Monika Devi that she was barred from taking part in the Beijing Games because of deliberate lapses on part of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).         
	The CBI registered the Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against unknown persons after a request was made by the Manipur Government to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for a thorough probe into the entire incident.         
	While during the PE, the CBI will summon records of IOA, Sports Authority of India (SAI) and the statement of Monika before the one-man commission set up by the Sports Ministry, it cannot go in for questioning of any individual till the case is converted into a regular case.         
	Monika, in her deposition before the T S Krishnamurthy Commission, had alleged the actions of the SAI as unreasonable and malafide and also that she failed to go to Beijing Olympics because of the deliberate lapse on the part of the IOA. The weightlifter, in her petition, had blamed the SAI for the whole controversy which led to her withdrawal from the Indian Olympic contingent.         
	If the report (dope test) was at all positive, why did the SAI not inform the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) 48-72 hours prior to the departure as required under the provisions of WADA? she questioned.         
	The CBI would be examining all the test reports during its probe before deciding on whether the case could be converted into a regular case or not.

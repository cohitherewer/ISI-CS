The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Run outs made the difference: Sachin
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Run outs made the difference: Sachin
                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar rued the spate of run outs that led to their defeat against Kings XI Punjab on Wednesday and said it was one area the team would have to focus on.         
	Sometimes calls are not heard in the din of the crowd. However, it is all part and parcel of the game and it is something we would need to look at closely before our next game, he said after his side lost by one run at the Wankhede.         
	Five Mumbai batsmen were run out chasing a target of 190.         
	Sachin, however, refused to comment on some contentious decisions of the third umpire, saying it was up to the teams management to take up the issue if they wanted to.         
	Sachin, who was run out for 65, said that his dismissal had come at a fairly crucial juncture of the game.         
	When I got out we were cruising comfortably. I thought if we hadnt lost my wicket at that stage we could have won with five balls to spare, he said.         
	If two run outs had been averted then we would have had two more runs which would have meant us winning the match, he said.         
	The batsman, who top-scored for the team, said he was happy to be among runs in the tournament after notching up low scores in the three previous games.         
	The flow is coming slowly. After a break of about two months to come back and perform is not easy, he said.         
	Kings XI captain Yuvraj Singh acknowledged Sachins run out was the turning point in the nail-biting finish.         
	While Sachin was at the crease I thought he would stay till end. After he got out the momentum shifted in our favour, Yuvraj said.         
	Speaking about his dramatic run-out effort off the last ball to send back the home teams No. 11 batsman Vikrant Yeligati, Yuvraj said that he had decided if the ball came to him he would rush to the stumps, instead of taking a potshot at the wicket.         
	I knew that if any of the circle fielders had got the ball, they would have thrown at the stumps. But it came to me and I had planned that I would run with it to the stumps, he said.         
	He felt the teams bowling and fielding fell short of expectations.           (PTI)

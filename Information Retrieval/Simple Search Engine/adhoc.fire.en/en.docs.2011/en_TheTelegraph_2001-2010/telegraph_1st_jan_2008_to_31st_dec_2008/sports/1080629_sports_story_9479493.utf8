	London: New Zealand clinched a 3-1 series win over England by cruising to a 51-run victory in the fifth and final one-day International at Lords on Saturday, ensuring Kevin Pietersen tasted defeat on his debut as skipper.         
	The home team, chasing a target of 267, were bowled out for 215 in 47.5 overs. Captain Daniel Vettori and Tim Southee took three wickets apiece while Owais Shah top-scored with 69.         
	Earlier, Scott Styris and Jacob Oram hit half-centuries to guide New Zealand to 266 for five.         
	The second match in the series was abandoned as no-result.         
	The one-day triumph was a major coup for the Black Caps after they were beaten 2-0 in the Test series.         
	Pietersen, replacing the suspended Paul Collingwood as captain, won the toss and elected to field first.         
	The game was evenly poised with New Zealand on 124 for four but a stand of 77 by Styris and Oram turned the heat up on England.         
	Oram cracked 52 off 40 balls while Styris played patiently until unleashing several ferocious strokes in the closing overs to finish 87 not out.         
	Styris, who was dropped on 13 by Ravi Bopara and survived a loud appeal for a stumping on 39, faced 91 deliveries.         
	The highlight of his innings came when he launched Ryan Sidebottom into the top tier of the stands for a mighty six late in the innings.         
	Pietersen made few mistakes on the field although he may regret using part-time spinner Shah, who went for 30 in his three overs.           (REUTERS)

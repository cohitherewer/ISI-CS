	Virginia Water: On a day when the west course of the Went Worth club bared it fangs, Jyoti Randhawa turned in as one of the only three sub-70 scores of the day to catapult himself to the tied fourth place after the penultimate round at the BMW PGA championship.         
	For the third day on the trot, Randhawa picked up a show on the par five fourth hole.         
	The 15th hole double bogey was the lone blot in an otherwise impeccable card as the Indian blasted four birdies in his back nine alone to join overnight leader Paul McGinley (79) and Daniel Vancsik (72) at six-under 210.         
	At the top, Robert Karlssons (206) roller coaster round of 70 fetched him the lead.         
	Close on his heels were Miguel Angel Jimenez (72) of Spain and Oliver Wilson (73) of England, who were chasing him from three shots behind. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My attitude wont change: Hair
                                                   My attitude wont change: Hair
                      
	Sydney: After being reinstated as a member of the Elite Panel of umpires, Darrell Hair has made it clear that his attitude will not change drastically but admitted that he has been learning a few things to improve his communication. Hair said he spent stressful days since he was dumped from the panel in November 2006.         
	It caused me a lot of stress, I suppose it caused a lot of people some stress along the way. The laws now have been changed to take those decisions out of the hands of the umpires and I fully support the way that thats going to happen in the future.         
	So, its time to move on, Hair told a radio station on Thursday.         
	The Australian said his new innings would focus on better on-field communication. Every day in life you like to pick up something and move forward, so I wont say my whole attitude to umpiring has changed. But I think I have picked up a few things that are going to be very helpful to me in the future. Probably just having a broader understanding of what everybody else is thinking and the old communication issue of making sure that what you say and what you want is understood by others.         
	The controversial Australian, who officiated in ICC associate matches after being ousted from the Elite Panel, said he would look to get more involved in on-field proceedings after resuming his job.         
	Ive always been a little bit stand-offish in that Ive always preferred to let them play the game themselves and only get involved when things go overboard but maybe theres a case to be made for a little bit more work in that area, Hair said.         
	The Australians re-reinstatement evoked sharp criticism from Pakistan cricket fraternity but Hair said he was not concerned with others views and wants to concentrate on his job.         
	No Ive got no comment on anyone elses reaction really. Im just going to look after my own patch and go out there and officiate in the matches that Im appointed to and do that to the best of my ability which is what Ive always done, he said.         
	Hair was removed from the Elite Panel after the Oval Test fiasco, when Pakistan became the first team to forfeit a Test. PCB officials have made it clear that they do not want Hair to officiate any international match involving their country.         
	The 55-year-old said he had no problems if he is asked to officiate in Pakistan matches. Part of my contract is that Im available now to officiate in Tests and ODIs. Now whether that is going to happen, I think youll need to ask the people who make the appointments, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky Ponting injury not serious: Physio
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ricky Ponting injury not serious: Physio
                      
	Melbourne: Australian cricket team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris has refuted speculations that skipper Ricky Pontings career could see a premature end due to a wrist injury.         
	Ponting was due to visit his surgeon Greg Hoy here on Thursday for assessing his right wrist, after he underwent an operation in July to repair tissue and tendon damage.         
	But Kountouris said the appointment was scheduled six weeks ago and speculation that it was because Ponting was experiencing unexpected after-effects from the operation was not true.         
	Pontings pain was standard after any type of surgery and was not severe enough to have caused him to miss a training session, let alone consider being rested from any matches, Alex Kountouris was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	Ricky Ponting got a little bit of pain in his wrist, no more than what other players carry in other parts of their bodies.         
	Hes really not having anything of significance that he has to miss any games. It would be ridiculous for him to miss any games or any training at this point in time, he added. Kountouris also said Ponting was undergoing ice treatment, and his wrist has been strapped.         
	Meanwhile, the physio also informed that off-spinner Jason Krejza was recovering well from his ankle injury which kept him out of the Adelaide Test against New Zealand.

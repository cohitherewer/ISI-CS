                                                   MASSIVE OPENING STATEMENT
                      
	South Africa captain Graeme Smith (232) and Neil McKenzie (226) set a world record 415-run opening stand in Chittagong on Saturday. They rewrote the 52-year-old record by Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy against New Zealand.         
	 It was only the second time a pair of openers had both notched double centuries in a Test. The first pair to achieve the mark was Australias William Lawry (210) and Robert Simpson (201) against the West Indies in Barbados in 1965.         
	The following are the statistical highlights:

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal, Djokovic set up semi-final showdown 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nadal, Djokovic set up semi-final showdown

	Paris: Five rounds into the French Open, king of clay Rafael Nadal still awaits a serious challenge. Novak Djokovic hopes to provide it in the semi-finals.         
	Three time defending champion Nadal matched the most lopsided Grand Slam victory of his career on Tuesday, defeating fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 on his 22nd birthday. The drubbing equalled the standard Nadal set in his previous triumph, when he lost three games against another Spaniard, Fernando Verdasco.         
	Nadal was giving the Center Court crowd a thumbs-up signal to punctuate his achievement shortly after Djokovic completed a much more arduous win on Court Suzanne Lenglen. He needed more than three hours to eliminate childhood friend Ernests Gulbis 7-5, 7-6 (3), 7-5.         
	The No. 3-seeded Djokovic would play No. 2 Nadal in a much-anticipated showdown on Friday, with No. 1 Roger Federer looming as a potential opponent for the winner in the final.         
	 Nadal is 26-0 at Roland Garros, but Djokovic is making a mark in the record book, too. The Australian Open champion has reached five consecutive Grand Slam semi-finals, joining Federer, Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker as the only men to accomplish the feat in the Open era.         
	Ana Ivanovic beat Patty Schnyder 6-3, 6-2 to become the first womens semi-finalist. Ivanovics rival on Thursday would be the winner of the later match between No. 3-seeded Jelena Jankovic and unseeded Carla Suarez Navarro.         
	I am really happy the way Im playing, said the No. 2-seeded Ivanovic. I just want to keep this level.         
	 Ivanovic has reached the semi-finals at four of the past five Grand Slam events, starting with her run at Roland Garros a year ago, when she lost to Justine Henin in the final.         
	 She struggled against the 10th-seeded Schnyder only when trying to close out the victory. With light and rain beginning to fall, she hit her second and third double-faults of the match in the final game before smacking a service winner on the third match point.         
	Svetlana Kuznetsova advanced to the quarter finals for the third year in a row by completing a victory over Victoria Azarenka 6-2, 6-3. Kuznetsovas opponent on Wednesday would be Kaia Kanepi, who became the first Estonian to reach the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam tournament by beating Petra Kvitova 6-3, 3-6, 6-1.         
	 Kanepi and Kuznetsova won the games suspended on Monday because of darkness. The No. 4-seeded Kuznetsova hit 10 aces against the No. 16-seeded Azarenka, a Belarusian who lives in Scottsdale, Arizona.         
	Azarenka was 0-for-7 on break point chances, all in the first set. Kuznetsova has lost only 19 matches in four rounds, sweeping every set.           (AP)

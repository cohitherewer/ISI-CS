The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IFA Shield postponed
                                                                                                                                                                                                     IFA Shield postponed
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The IFA Shield was postponed indefinitely on Tuesday.         
	After a meeting of Shield sub-committee, IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly told reporters that the tournament could not be held in January as scheduled as there were too many things to be taken care of.         
	We dont want to hold IFA Shield if it loses importance. Neither does ESPN (which has the telecast rights), Ganguly said. If the Shield takes place in January, clubs would be hard-pressed as the second phase of the I-League starts from 14th. Getting grounds and police would be a problem before the second phase.         
	Under the circumstances, were thinking about holding the Shield in July-August next year, before the start of the I-League, he added.         
	Ganguly informed the media that he will place this proposal before the governing body on Thursday. He will also meet the AIFF officials on Saturday and try to find a permanent slot for the Shield on the AIFF calendar.         
	I cant say the exact time of the Shield till the governing body okays it but I think if it is held in July-August that would be a good time. In that case, this would be a season-opening tournament and the clubs will have enough time to prepare for the I-League, Ganguly said.         
	The fact that contributed to the Shield being postponed was the unavailability of the Salt Lake Stadium from February to June. Salt Lake Stadium will be renovated. The work will start in February and wont be over till June. All I-League matches then would be held at Barasat, he said.

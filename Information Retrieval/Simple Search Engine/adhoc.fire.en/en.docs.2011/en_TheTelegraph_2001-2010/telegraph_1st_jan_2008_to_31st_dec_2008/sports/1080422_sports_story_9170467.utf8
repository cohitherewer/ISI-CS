The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hayden: Theres an aura about Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hayden: Theres an aura about Dhoni
                  Mahendra Singh Dhoni                     
	Chennai: Australia opener Matthew Hayden, member of the Chennai Super Kings, was all praise for Indian Premier League teammate Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Monday.         
	Here at a practice session ahead of Chennai Super Kings next encounter against Mumbai Indians, Hayden lauded Indias ODI and the Twenty20 captain, saying that he didnt mind playing under Dhoni.         
	I have no issues with that. Dhoni is a fine thinker and a confident individual There is an aura about him, he said.         
	For me, it is a great experience sharing the dressing room with Indians and learning how they go about their cricket.         
	Hayden said he is looking forward to renewing his rivalry with off-spinner Harbhajan Singh.         
	We have had some fantastic battles over the years. Both of us have had successes. I am looking forward to renewing my rivalry with Harbhajan. It will be a great battle and the whole world will be watching, Hayden said on Tuesday.         
	He refused to comment on his obnoxious weed remark.         
	Harbhajan plays for Mumbai Indians and the two are slated to face each other on Wednesday.         
	Hayden was addressing a press meet here after a strenuous practice session.         
	The burly left-hander said the IPL was the start of an incredible journey.         
	Cricket will benefit immensely from the tournament. This format is a huge success like the Packer series and had ushered in many positives. The competition would regularly witness scores in excess of 200 from an innings in the tournament.         
	Chepauk wicket looks very good as usual. A score of 200-plus is a distinct possibility, he said.         
	In Mohali, we saw over 400 runs scored in just 40 overs. We will witness high scores regularly, he said.         
	I first visited Chennai in 1997 along with the Australian A team, my first trip to India, which was the start of my love affair with the country.         
	Walking out to bat, I looked around at this stadium and dreamt of the day I will play for the Australian team. I have always had a soft corner for India and now, playing for Chennai Super Kings, my life has come full circle as this city will be my base during the IPL, Hayden said.         
	Several of the Australians playing in the IPL will leave midway to prepare for the tour of West Indies, but Hayden felt it will not adversely impact the tournament.         
	The non-availability of foreign players will not affect the IPL. That is the beauty of the tournament. You get to see almost all top players in the world at some point in the tournament. I think the IPL is that start of an incredible journey.         
	But he wanted the restriction of four foreign players in the playing XI to be lifted.         
	I feel it must be free for all. The best must be allowed to play in a tournament of this magnitude, Hayden added. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wriddhiman is elated
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wriddhiman is elated
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A timely knock of 25 and a catch summarised Wriddiman Sahas first appearance in the last league match of the ongoing tri-series against Australia A in Chennai on Wednesday.         
	Chasing Australias 272, Wriddhiman, who replaced Dinesh Karthick for Wednesday match, had an unbeaten 37-run partnership with Piyush Chawla to help India A notch up a three-wicket win.         
	Wriddhiman, who came in after Rohit Sharma was sent back to the pavilion, first had a 26-run partnership with Yusuf Pathan, and then a 27-run stand with Irfan.         
	It always feels nice when your team wins And when your contribution counts, it feels even better, the 23-year old wicketkeeper told The Telegraph from Chennai on Wednesday evening.         
	I was waiting for a chance and I am happy that I have delivered when the team required, Wriddhiman said.         
	According to the right-handed batsman, a few more chances will surely help him in proving his mettle behind the wickets.         
	I feel if I get a few more opportunities, I would be able to prove my potential, he remarked.         
	Wriddhimans performance for Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League earlier this year had impressed one and all.

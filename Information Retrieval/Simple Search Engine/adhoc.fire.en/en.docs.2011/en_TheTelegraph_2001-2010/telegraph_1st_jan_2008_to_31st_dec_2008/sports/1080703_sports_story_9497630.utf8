The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Being positive helped, says Misbah-ul Haq
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Being positive helped, says Misbah-ul Haq
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pakistan captain Misbah-ul Haq was happy after winning against India on debut as captain.         
	The following are excerpts:         
	Misbah-ul Haq: Its a wonderful start for me as a captain... Credit goes to the team. The boys came back well after India got off to a good start. We knew the score was gettable on this track. I just told them to be positive. Ajmals was a wonderful performance, especially against India who play spin very well. Its very simple against Bangladesh We have to just go out there and win comprehensively.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni: We got off to a good start but lost wickets at regular intervals. There was a situation in the middle overs where if we had lost one more wicket, the game would have been over. We wanted to have wickets at the 38-40 over mark But we kept losing wickets. Pakistan started very well and all their batsmen batted well. We could have done better in our bowling but on this track the score was not enough. We can say that we didnt have experienced spinners. Spinners need a bit of experience to bowl on this track. I was a bit disappointed with the bowling. Chawla has done well and he would learn from these games. There will be pressure on us tomorrow (Thursday), but we have to do well. Hopefully we will win against Sri Lanka and qualify for the final.         
	Younis Khan (MoM): Against India its always difficult. We had a good start. I just went there and batted sensibly. Misbah finished off very well. I practised my (sweep) shots against the spinners and it is working. But the main thing is the wicket was pretty flat.

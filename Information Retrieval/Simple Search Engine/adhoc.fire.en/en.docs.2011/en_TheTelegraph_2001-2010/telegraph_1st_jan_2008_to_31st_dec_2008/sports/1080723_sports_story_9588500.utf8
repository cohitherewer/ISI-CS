The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania moves to 2nd round 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sania moves to 2nd round

	Los Angeles: Sania Mirza seems to have hit form as she quelled a late challenge from qualifier Eva Hrdinova to advance to the singles second round of the $600,000 East West Bank Classic tournament here on Tuesday.         
	Sania, seeded 16th, beat her Czech opponent 6-3, 6-4 in the first round of the hard court event in one hour and seven minutes.         
	Sania has been struggling after returning to the circuit from a three-month lay off following a wrist injury as she crashed out of the Stanford West Bank Classic in the first round, after a disappointing singles run at the Wimbledon championships.         
	The Indian ace raced away with the first set in just 30 minutes.         
	In the second set, Sania was trailing 1-3 as the Czech fought back, but the Hyderabadi got her elements together as she saved four breakpoints and converted two to dump Hrdinova.         
	She next faces the winner of the match between Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine and Chinese Meng Yuan.         
	If she manages to the win the second round, she could find second seed American Serena Williams in the pre-quarter final round.         
	In the doubles event, Sania and her American partner Bethanie Mattek have been seeded second and they open their campaign against Vania King of America and Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia.

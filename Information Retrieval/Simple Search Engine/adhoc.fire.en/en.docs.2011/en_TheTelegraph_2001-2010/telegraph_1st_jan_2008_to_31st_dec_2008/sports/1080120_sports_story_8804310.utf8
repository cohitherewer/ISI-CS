	Ricky Ponting said on Saturday that talks of Australias domination being over, following the Perth defeat, were premature. The Australian captain promised to come back strongly in the final Test in Adelaide. The following are excerpts from Pontings news conference after the match: 
    
	How disappointed are you after failing to break the record of most number of Test wins on the trot? 
    
	Its disappointing Its been a pretty good run, would have been great to win one more, or even ten more, but we havent been good enough. The run was always going to come to an end at some stage. 
    
	Is the aura of invincibility around your team over? 
    
	I was reading about it in the paper today (Saturday) Is the invincibility all over?  That we are on the slide I wouldnt have thought so. Well see... Its up to us to see how we bounce back in Adelaide. Australia is usually a team which turns things around pretty quickly. 
    
	Was bowling a big let-down for you? 
    
	No, I dont think so It was a tough four days, and the bowlers did an outstanding job by dismissing India for manageable totals, but when it mattered we didnt produce the runs. We didnt produce the brand of cricket we are renowned for, and let ourselves down. 
    
	Given what had happened in Sydney, did you underestimate Indias mental toughness for a comeback here? 
    
	We never underestimate any opponent, certainly not the Indians. They are particularly a very good batting side and formidable opponents. Their bowlers have done a good job. No, we didnt underestimate them. Calcutta was probably a very good example and even in Adelaide in the last series in Australia, they had beaten us 
    
	Any changes in the side for Adelaide Test? 
    
	Chris Rogers is out and Matthew Hayden is in. The rest of the players remain the same.

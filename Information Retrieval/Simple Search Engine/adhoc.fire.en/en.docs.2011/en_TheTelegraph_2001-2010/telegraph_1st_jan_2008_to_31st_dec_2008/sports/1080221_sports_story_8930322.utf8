                                                   Lanka recall Herath
                      
	Colombo: Sri Lanka have recalled spinner Rangana Herath and middle-order batsman Thilan Samaraw-eera for their two-match Test series against West Indies starting in March.         
	Herath, a 29-year-old left-arm spinner, played the last of his 12 Tests in 2005 but his consistent performances in domestic cricket have enabled him to claim the second spinners position ahead of Malinga Bandara.Samaraweera won his place back in the Sri Lanka top order for their two-Test tour of Australia last November but was axed after two low scores in Brisbane.         
	Fast bowler Ishara Amarasinghe, 29, has been rewarded for his impressive performances in the current triangular series in Australia with a place on his first test tour. Left-arm fast bowler Thilan Thushara has also been recalled. Thushara played a solitary test against West Indies in Jamaica in 2003.         
	The tour starts on March 17 with a practice game and includes two tests in Guyana and Trinidad before a three-match one-day International series finishing on April 15.

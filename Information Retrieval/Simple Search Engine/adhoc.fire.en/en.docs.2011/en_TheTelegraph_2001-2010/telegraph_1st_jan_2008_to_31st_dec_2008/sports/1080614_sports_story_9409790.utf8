	Bridgetown: West Indies cleaned up Australias tail in swift fashion on Friday but then lost their top order as they went in at 89 for three at lunch on the second day of an absorbing and fast-paced third Test.         
	In a week dominated by talk of the rise of Twenty20 cricket, the two sides proved that the longer version of the game need not be pedestrian with West Indies, in particular, batting at a rapid tempo  their 89 runs coming from just 17 overs.         
	Fidel Edwards took two wickets in the session as West Indies bowled out the tourists for 251  just 25 runs being added with the loss of three wickets from the overnight score.         
	But then the Aussies fought back before lunch claiming the key batsmen Ramnaresh Sarwan and captain Chris Gayle along with opener Sewnarine Chattergoon.         
	Brett Lee claimed both openers, luring Chattergoon into a drive outside off stump that he nicked to Brad Haddin and then getting the prize wicket of Gayle on his return from injury.         
	Tall left-hander Gayle had bludgeoned three fours but then heaved a poor shot to mid-off where debutant Beau Casson made a fine catch.         
	The lively and bouncy wicket encouraged stroke play and West Indies rattled on at an impressive rate with Sarwan and Xavier Marshall taking the hosts to 50 within ten overs.         
	But then Mike Hussey produced a brilliant diving catch at backward point to dismiss Sarwan for 20 off the bowling of Stuart Clark.         
	Marshall, looking in good shape, was joined by Shivnarine Chanderpaul before the interval  he is currently averaging 166 in this series.         
	Earlier Edwards trapped debutant Beau Casson (10) leg before and then Jerome Taylor dismissed Mitchell Johnson for a duck with a sharply rising delivery that the Australian edged to Sulieman Benn at gully.         
	Edwards finished off Australia when he clean bowled Stuart Clark with an in swing delivery to complete an impressive bowling display from the home side.         
	Edwards, Taylor and Dwayne Bravo all finished with three wickets apiece. Australia lead 1-0 after the opening two matches of the three Test series.           (REUTERS)

	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh consolidated his place among the elite by rising to 44th place in the latest World Golf Rankings issued on Monday.         
	Jeev, who partnered Jyoti Randhawa and finished tied 17th in the World Cup in Shenzhen on Sunday, climbed a rung from previous weeks 45th place.         
	Randhawa, though, is exactly 100 runs behind Jeev at 144th place following a string of below-par shows.         
	Among the others, PGA Tour-bound Arjun Atwal is ranked 201st while SSP Chowrasia is way behind at 316.         
	Jeev, meanwhile, has confirmed his participation in the Volvo Masters of Asia $750,000 event to put himself in line for a second Asian Tour title this season.

    - Thrilling wins are the order of the day                 Graeme Smith on way to 91 against Chennai Super Kings on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Chennai: Rajasthan Royals edged past Chennai Super Kings to register their tenth win of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) on Saturday and further consolidate their position at the top of the table.         
	The Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led Chennai outfit fell 10 runs short of their target after they put up a spirited run chase with Albie Morkels 40-ball 71. In the end, though, his effort wasnt enough, which means Chennai still have work to do to make it to the last four.         
	Earlier, Graeme Smith led a batting assault with a blistering 51-ball 91 and, backed up by an equally explosive 28-ball 53 by Kamran Akmal, helped the Rajasthan outfit post a huge 211 for five.         
	Electing to bat after winning the toss, the rampaging Royals, who rested four players to bring in new faces, sent Super Kings bowlers for a leather hunt for most part of match.         
	Smith and Swapnil Asnodkar plundered 127 runs for the first wicket, second highest IPL opening stand, from just 67 balls to lay the foundation for a big total.         
	The duo were in such an attacking mood that they reached 50-run mark in just 4.5 overs and coasted to 100 in 9.4 overs.         
	The home team had to toil till the 12th over for their first success when Asnodkar was run out for 44, failing to beat a Dhoni-Parthiv Patel combine.         
	Smith continued in his attacking mode but was unlucky to miss a hundred by nine runs after batting so beautifully. He fell to part timer Suresh Raina while trying for a lofted drive for Dhoni to hold a fine catch after running from cover region.         
	The next two batsmen  Yusuf Pathan (6) and Mohammed Kaif (10)  did not contribute much, both falling to Albie Morkel and the run rate dipped as the visitors scored just 44 from the last five overs.         
	Pakistani Kamran Akmal smashed 53 to take the score past 210.         
	Morkel was the most successful Chennai bowler with two for 35 while Raina claimed one wicket for 20.           (PTI)

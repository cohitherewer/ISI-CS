                                                                                                                                                                                                     Liverpool, Inter seal last 16 berths
                      
	Liverpool: England midfielder Steven Gerrards first-half goal secured Liverpools place in the last 16 of the Champions League as they beat Olympique Marseille 1-0 at Anfield.         
	The Liverpool skipper scored with a far-post header in the 23rd minute from Xabi Alonsos deep cross to settle the group D clash.         
	Gerrard, who was hit by a cigarette lighter thrown from the section occupied by the French sides supporters later in the game, has now scored five goals in this seasons Champions League, a feat only matched by Barcelonas Lionel Messi.         
	Liverpool and Atletico Madrid, who have also qualified for the knockout phase, have 11 points with one match remaining. Atletico Madrid beat PSV Eindhoven 2-1.         
	Inter Milan also sealed their berth in the 16, advancing from group B despite a surprise 0-1 home defeat to Panthinaikos that left their manager Jose Mourinho fuming.         
	The Italian champions were left on eight points after Jose Sarriegi struck in the 69th minute to lift Panathinaikos into second place on seven and they need only a draw from their final match at home to Cypriots Anorthosis Famagusta, who have six.         
	Champions League debutants Anorthosis will be kicking themselves after squandering a 2-0 lead against Werder Bremen as they now head to Athens needing a win to leapfrog Panathinaikos into the runners-up spot.         
	Nikos Nikolau and Savio put the Cypriots in the driving seat before Werder hit back through Diego and Hugo Almeida.         
	AS Roma won 3-1 at CFR Cluj thanks to a Matteo Brighi brace and a third by Francesco Totti to go top of the group on nine points, ahead of Chelsea who have eight and Bordeaux on seven.         
	All three sides can go through while Cluj, who made a bright start with four points from their opening two games, are out of Europe after three successive defeats.         
	Barcelona, the 2006 winners, sealed top spot in group B after a 5-2 away drubbing of also qualified Sporting while Jadson hit a hattrick for Shakhtar Donetsk who clinched a place in the Uefa Cup last 32 with a 5-0 home rout of Basel.         
	Early goals from Thierry Henry and Gerrard Pique sent Barcelona on their way while Lionel Messi and Bojan Krkic were also on target for the Catalan side either side of a Marco Caneira own-goal.

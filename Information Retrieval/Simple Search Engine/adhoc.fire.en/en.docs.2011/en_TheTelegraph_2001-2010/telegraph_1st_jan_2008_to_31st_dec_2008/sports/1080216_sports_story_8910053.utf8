                                                     Its official, Seles retires
                  Monica Seles                     
	Miami: Former world No. 1 Monica Seles announced her official retirement from professional tennis at the age of 34 on Thursday, nearly five years since she last played.         
	Seles won nine Grand Slam singles titles and 53 tournaments in her career. She had not played competitively since the 2003 French Open but, plagued by a succession of foot injuries, had tried to launch several comebacks.         
	I have for some time considered a return to professional play, but I have now decided not to pursue that, Seles said in a statement released by her manager and published on the WTA tour website.         
	I will continue to play exhibitions, participate in charity events, promote the sport, but will no longer plan my schedule around the tour.         
	I look forward to pursuing other opportunities with the same passion and energy that fuelled my dedication to tennis and to devote more time to two of my passions  children and animals.         
	The native Yugoslav won her first Grand Slam at the 1990 French Open and became world No. 1 in 1991, staying top of the rankings until April 1993 when she was stabbed during a match in Hamburg.         
	She did not play again for more than two years but she made a swift impact on her return, winning the Canadian Open and Australian Open.         
	Seles, who became a US citizen in 1994, played her final match at the 2003 French Open where she suffered a first-round loss to Nadia Petrova.         
	Larry Scott, CEO of the WTA Tour, said in a statement: Monica Seles is one of the great champions in the history of the WTA Tour, and an inspiration and role model for millions of fans throughout the world.         
	No one will ever forget the fierce determination and will to win that Monica brought to the court, nor the caring and warm person that she has always been off the court.         
	Seles claimed a major haul of four Australian, three French and two US Open titles.

  A Telegraph picture      
	Calcutta: World No. 28 Omar Mosaad of Egypt Wednesday eliminated India No. 1 Saurav Ghosal 11-8, 4-11, 11-9, 11-1 to shatter Indias hopes of making further progress in the Calcutta International Squash Championship.         
	Ghosal was the lone surviving Indian after Ritwik Bhattacharya made an early exit.         
	At the Calcutta Racket Club, Ghosal started with a lot of promise but the Egyptian held his nerves in the crucial third and fourth games to settle the issue. After Mosaad won the first game, Ghosal bounced back in the second. The third game was evenly poised but Mosaad clinched it with his brilliant slotting.         
	This was Ghosals third defeat against Mosaad.         
	I rolled a few shots in the second game. But I knew he would come back hard and he did just that. In the fourth game, he was too good and he did not give me anything to hit. His shots came like a barrage, Ghosal said.         
	Mosaad, on the other hand, felt Ghosal became a bit slow in the fourth game while the Indian world No. 47 admitted that the Egyptian was too good.         
	Mosaad will take on Pakistans Mansoor Zaman. Mansoor got past his cousin Shahid Zaman in a close encounter.         
	World No. 35 and tournament fifth seed Mansoor rebounded after the initial reverse to win 5-11, 11-6, 11-8, 11-6.         
	Shahid, who conquered top seed Mohammed Azlan Sikandar of Malaysia in the opening round Wednesday, took the first game in style, but Mansoor fought back spectacularly by letting loose several drop shots and covering the court well.         
	Sixth seeded and another Egyptian Omar Abdel Aziz created an upset by showing the door to fourth seeded Pakistani Aamir Atlas Khan in a classic encounter that could easily be regarded as the match of the tournament so far.         
	Aziz won the nail-biting contest 6-11, 11-3, 7-11, 11-1 and 11-7 to set up a semi-final clash with second seeded Malaysian Ong Beng Hee, who carved out a straight-game victory over Pakistans Farhan Mehboob 12-10 (2-0), 11-9, 11-4.

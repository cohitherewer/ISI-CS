	New Delhi: Leander Paes and his partner Lukas Dlouhy overcame Marcos Baghdatis and Olivier Rochus in straight sets to advance to the pre-quarter finals of mens doubles event of the euro 713000 Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany on Monday.         
	The fourth-seeded Indo-Czech duo defeated the unseeded Cyprus-Belgium pair 6-2, 7-6(6) in one hour and nine minutes in the first round of the grass court competition, which is a warm up event for the Wimbledon Championships.         
	Paes and Dlouhy converted two of the four breakpoints in the first set to shoot into the lead. Their rivals did stretch them in the second, exchanging breaks and eventually pushing the set to a tie-breaker, but Paes and his new doubles partner finally prevailed.         
	In another ATP event in London, the euro 713000 Artois Championships, Indian Davis Cuppers Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna also booked a pre-quarter final berth after getting a bye in the first round.

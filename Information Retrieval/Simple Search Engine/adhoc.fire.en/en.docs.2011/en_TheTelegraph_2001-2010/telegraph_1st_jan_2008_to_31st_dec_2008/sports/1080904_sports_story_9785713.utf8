	Advani was joined in the last four by defending champion (points format) Rupesh Shah, Geet Sethi and Devendra Joshi.         
	In the other quarter-finals, Shah came from behind to beat Dhruv Sitwala (India) 4-1 (113-150, 152-32, 150-142, 150-44, 151-74), veteran Sethi ousted compatriot Alok Kumar 4-2 (151-21, 150-7, 151-2, 68-150, 5-150, 121-5) (match conceded), while Joshi eliminated Praprut Chaithanasakun (Thailand) 4-2 (150-89, 0-150, 138-151, 150-8, 150-70, 150-0).

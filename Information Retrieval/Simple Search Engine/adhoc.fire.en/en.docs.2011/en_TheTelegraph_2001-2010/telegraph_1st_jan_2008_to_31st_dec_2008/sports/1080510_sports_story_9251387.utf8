The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Steady start by Kapur
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Steady start by Kapur
                      
	Milan: Shiv Kapur kicked off his Italian Open campaign with a sedate two-under 70, which had the Indian at tied 53rd after the first round of the European Tour event at the Cstello di Tolcinasco Golf and County Club.         
	The Delhi lad had an action-packed front nine. After a birdie-bogey start to his round, Shiv picked up a shot each on the fourth, fifth and ninth but also dropped a shot on the sixth as well to take the turn at two-under.         
	Marco Ruiz of Paraguay and Englishman Ross Mcgowan blasted identical eight-under 64 to share the lead, with Englands Mark Foster, South African Hennie Otto and Marc Warren of Scotland hot on their heels.         
	In Beijing, Gaurav Gheis title defence ended in disaster as he missed the cut by a stroke after carding an even-par 72 in the second round of the Pine Valley Beijing Open on Friday.

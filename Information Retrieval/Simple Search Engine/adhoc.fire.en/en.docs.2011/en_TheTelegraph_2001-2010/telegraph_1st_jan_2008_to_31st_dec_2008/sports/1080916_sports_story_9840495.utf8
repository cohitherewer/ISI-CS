The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni ready for Tests: Arthur 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Dhoni ready for Tests: Arthur 
                      
	New Delhi: The BCCI might be unhappy with India coach Gary Kirsten for commenting on the captaincy issue but former South Africa opener has found backing from Micky Arthur, who blamed the Indian media for the furore.         
	The Proteas coach feels Kirsten did nothing wrong when he said that Indias ODI skipper M. S. Dhoni was ready to take charge of the Test team.         
	Kumble is 38, for goodness sake. He has back-to-back series against Australia and Pakistan coming up. How long do people expect him to carry on?         
	All Gary was doing was attempting to re-assure Indians that Dhoni was qualified and ready to take over. And yet the media managed to twist his words into an attack on Kumble, Arthur wrote in his column on a website.         
	Arthur also felt that this could fuel tension between the captain and the coach.         
	The relationship between captain and coach is critical to the success of any international team and I have personal experience of how much respect there is between Gary and Anil.         
	With the four-match Test series against Australia coming up, the South Africa coach hoped the captaincy issue would not affect Indias performance.         
	Hopefully it wont detract, in any way, from Team Indias performance against Australia. It is a series I will be watching extremely closely.         
	Good Luck India. And if Anil does retire afterwards, along with, perhaps, one or two other senior players, then I hope they have good reason to celebrate.

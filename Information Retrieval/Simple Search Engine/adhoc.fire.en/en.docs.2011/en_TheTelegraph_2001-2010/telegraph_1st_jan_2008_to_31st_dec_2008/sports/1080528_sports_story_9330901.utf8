                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mahesh, Leander in first round face off 
                      
	Paris: Squabbling former partners Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi have been pitted against each other in the opening round of the mixed doubles draw in the French Open.         
	While Paes will team up with Russian Nadia Petrova, Bhupathi has tied up with Chinas Jie Zhang. None of the two teams has been accorded any seedings.         
	Meanwhile, in the doubles draw released on Tuesday, Paes will play alongside Czech Lukas Dlouhy, after parting ways with Australian Paul Hanley.         
	The duo, seeded ninth, has been handed an easy first-round match against unseeded Thai pair of Sanchai Ratiwatana and Sonchat Ratiwatana.         
	Meanwhile, fourth seeds Bhupathi and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles have also been drawn against an unseeded team of Australian Stephen Huss and Brit Ross Hutchins.         
	Paes and Bhupathi, who have been at loggerheads for years now, were embroiled in a fresh war of words after Bhupathi wrote to All India Tennis Association (AITA), saying he wants to team up with Rohan Bopanna in the Beijing Olympics instead of Paes.         
	Meanwhile, Bopanna and his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi have a tough opener on hand as they take on top seeds Americans Bob and Mike Bryan.         
	With Sania Mirza rendered out of action due to a wrist injury, the Indian challenge at the claycourt grand slam has been restricted to doubles only.           (PTI)

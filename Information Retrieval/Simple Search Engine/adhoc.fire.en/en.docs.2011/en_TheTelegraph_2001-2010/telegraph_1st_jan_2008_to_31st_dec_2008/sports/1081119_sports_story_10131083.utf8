	Ghaziabad: Laxmipathy Balajis five-wicket haul (5/42) after Dinesh Karthiks double century (213) made a memorable day for Tamil Nadu as they thumped Uttar Pradesh by an innings and 238 runs on the third day of their Ranji Trophy Elite division match here on Tuesday.         
	In Rajkot, Cheteshwar Pujaras 182-ball 189 and Sitanshu Kotaks patient knock of 102 helped Saurashtra score 405 for four wickets against Punjab.         
	In Sambalpur, Orissa left-arm spinner Dhiraj Singh picked seven wickets on debut and it was largely his bowling that forced Rajasthan to concede a crucial first innings lead in the Group A tie.         
	In reply to Orissas first innings total of 281, Rajasthan were bundled out for 270 with Dhiraj claiming seven for 83. Former India batsman Gagan Khoda scored 127 for Rajasthan.         
	Assured of three points on the basis of a slender 11-run lead, Orissa were banking, yet again, on former India opener Shiv Sundar Das, who was batting on 57 when stumps were drawn on the penultimate day.         
	Giving him company was nightwatchman Pritamjeet Das (1) as Orissa recovered from an early shudder to finish the day at 109 for three.         
	Having claimed two wickets Monday, Dhiraj added five more on the spin-assisting track to take his first innings tally to seven.         
	It was another spinner, Paresh Patel, who, in fact, gave the early breakthrough with Rajasthan cruising on Khodas knock.         
	Resuming at the overnight score of 172 for two, Rajasthan lost their first wicket when Patel trapped Robin Bist (43) to break the 111-run third-wicket partnership with Khoda.         
	The breakthrough somewhat revived Orissa spinners as soon after Dhiraj began his wicket-taking spree, beginning with centurion Khoda, trapped leg before to end his 290-ball innings. Khoda hit 18 boundaries in his six-hour plus stay at the crease.         
	In Mysore, 17 wickets fell on the third day. Rahul Dravid scored a 50 in the second innings.         
	Summarised scores

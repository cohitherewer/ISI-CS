The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | UP bank on Kaif, Raina 
                                                UP bank on Kaif, Raina 
                      
	Vadodara: The Ranji Trophy Super League semi-final clash between Uttar Pradesh and Saurashtra at the Moti Bagh Stadium on Saturday is expected to be a contest of UP bowlers and Saurashtra batsmen.         
	UPs batting will revolve around Suresh Raina and Mohammed Kaif in the middle order; the two are, not surprisingly, the leading run-getters for them so far. Just when they seemed to have found an end to their opening problems, Tanmay Srivastava, who scored two half-centuries in their last match, has left to play for India under-19. Rahat Elahi is the man likely to replace him.         
	For Saurashtra, while their batsmen have been the focus with their dour batting, Sandeep Jobanputra, the left-arm medium-pacer, has quietly taken 32 wickets and is on the fourth spot interms of scalps.         
	In another semi-final Delhi will take on Baroda in Indore.         
	Meanwhile, in the Plate Group final Railways will take on Gujarat at the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai on Saturday.

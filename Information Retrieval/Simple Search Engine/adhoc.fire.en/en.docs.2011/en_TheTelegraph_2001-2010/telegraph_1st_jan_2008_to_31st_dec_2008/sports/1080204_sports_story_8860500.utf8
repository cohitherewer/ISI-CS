                                                   Gibbs helps SA to clean sweep

           
	Johannesburg: Herschelle Gibbs struck an imperious century to spur South Africa to an eight-wicket win over the West Indies on Sunday and a clean sweep in the five-match series. 
    
	After play was stopped twice by rain, South Africa were set a revised target of 211 in 31 overs in reply to West Indies 295 for seven and Gibbs blazed 102 off 84 balls, with 13 fours and three sixes. 
    
	South Africa lost an early wicket before the first rain interruption when captain Graeme Smith was bowled by Daren Powell for five. A 65-minute delay occurred when they were 19 for one and, after they had advanced the score to 34 for one, there was another interruption of 70 minutes. 
    
	Play resumed with South Africa needing another 177 runs in 23 overs but Gibbs and Jacques Kallis made light of the challenge. In the first five overs after the second rain delay they lashed 66 runs. 
    
	Kallis finished with 74 not out, facing 70 balls and hitting seven fours. 
    
	Devon Smiths career-best score had earlier inspired the West Indies to a reasonable total. The opener lashed 10 fours and three sixes in his 91 off 76 balls, while Patrick Browne made a bright 49 not out and Shivnarine Chanderpaul a more sedate 51. 
    
	Pollock stood out amongst a South African attack, taking one for 33 in 10 overs to finish his career with 393 wickets in 303 matches.

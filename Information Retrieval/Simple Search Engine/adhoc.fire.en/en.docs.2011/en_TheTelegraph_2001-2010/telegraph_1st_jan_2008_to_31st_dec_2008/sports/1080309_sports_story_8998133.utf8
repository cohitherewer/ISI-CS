                                                   Serena wins battle of sisters
                      
	Bangalore: American third seed Serena Williams beat older sister Venus on Saturday to win a place in the Bangalore Open final against Swiss world No. 12 Patty Schnyder.         
	World No. 11 Serena beat Venus, the No. 7, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 in a thrilling semi-final that lasted just over two hours and 10 minutes.         
	Left-handed fourth seed Schnyder had dispatched Chinas Yan Zi 6-3, 6-4 in 75 minutes in the first semi-final.         
	The Williams sisters, who have won 14 Grand Slam singles titles between them, were playing for the first time since the 2005 US Open fourth round.         
	Serena played more consistently to win the tie-breaker after the sisters had won a set each.         
	Swiss Schnyder broke Yan, who stunned top seed Jelena Jankovic in the quarter finals, in the fifth and ninth games to wrap up the first set.         
	World No. 54 Yan, who has won two Grand Slam doubles titles, staged a recovery in the second set to level at 3-3 but Schnyder broke her opponent twice more to seal the match.         
	Except my first serves, everything worked well, Schnyder told a news conference.I like the high balls and it took a while to get used to. I really had to push each shot.         
	The womens doubles final will be between Chinese pair of Shuai Peng and Tiantian Sun and Taipeis Chan Yung-jan and Chuang Chia-jung.           (PTI)

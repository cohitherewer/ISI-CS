The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lee absence gives India edge
                                                     Lee absence gives India edge
  - Australia want to wrest back the momentum from Dhoni amp; Co., says Gilchrist       A CORRESPONDENT            Michael Clarke is a doubtful starter after bruising his ribs in Fridays match versus Sri Lanka                                 
	Adelaide: India will look to take advantage of Brett Lees absence as they face Australia for the third time in the league phase of the tri-series at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday.         
	Lee, who has turned out to be the most lethal weapon for the home side this summer, will be rested as part of the player management policy and to refresh him for the later stages of the tournament.         
	Lee will not travel with the Australia team to Adelaide and will not play in tomorrows match as his workload is managed heading into the second half of the Commonwealth Bank series, Cricket Australia said in a statement.         
	The news could not have come at a better time for the Indians. This game assumes great importance for them as a victory would open up the gap with Sri Lanka both in terms of points and net run rate.         
	Australia lead the table with 12 points from four matches (run rate +1.179). India are second with eight points and have a net run rate of +0.147. Sri Lanka have 6 points (run rate -1.507).         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, though, did not wish to read too much into Lees absence. Australia have a good bowling attack with or without Lee. They have the power to get the batsman out. Lee has been one of their key bowlers during the summer but it depends on the one who is coming in his place, how well he does on the field, said the Team India captain.         
	The Indians are likely to go in with the same side that played Sri Lanka. Till late on Saturday, the only possibility being talked about informally was Munaf Patels coming in for Sreesanth.         
	There was further good news for India as Michael Clarke suffered bruised ribs during Fridays match against Sri Lanka at the Waca. David Hussey has been placed on standby.         
	Adam Gilchrist, who scored a century against Sri Lanka, said the hosts would like to wrestle back the momentum from a rampaging Indian team.         
	I am obviously very pleased to get a hundred in my final game at the Waca but I am equally focused on the match against India in Adelaide. They have been playing some fantastic cricket and we are obviously looking forward to wrestling back the momentum from them.         
	We have to focus on the games ahead and India are a very tough opponent, he said.         
	Three of Indias four games have been rain-affected but no such trouble is anticipated for Sundays match. It was pretty hot on Saturday and Australia will have to live up to the reality of Lees absence.         
	TEAMS         
	India (likely): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Robin Uthappa, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Sreesanth/Munaf Patel.         
	Australia (from): Matthew Hayden, Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Andrew Symonds, Mike Hussey, David Hussey, James Hopes, Brad Hogg, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Bracken.         
	Match starts: 8.45 am IST.

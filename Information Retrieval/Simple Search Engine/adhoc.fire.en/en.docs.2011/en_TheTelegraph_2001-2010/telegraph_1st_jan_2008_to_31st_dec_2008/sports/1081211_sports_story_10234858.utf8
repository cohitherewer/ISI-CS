The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aruna: Anand absent-minded
                                                                                                                                                                                           Aruna: Anand absent-minded
                      
	New Delhi: Its no secret that Viswanathan Anand is an undisputed genius in chess. But not many know he is absent-minded once he is out of the world of 64 squares. Wife Aruna wants to change that one bad habit of her husband.         
	Anand is a genius on the chess board but otherwise he is very absent minded. When we all get ready for a party, he would ask where are we going despite being told about it beforehand, Aruna said on the eve of Anands 39th birthday.         
	Aruna said he used to play on his birthday in the previous years and the day was lucky for the three-time World Champion.         
	He always wins on his birthday. But this time we are at home (in Chennai) so he wants me to bake a chocolate cake for him, Aruna said.           (PTI)

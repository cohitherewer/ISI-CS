The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds under Mark fire
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Symonds under Mark fire
                      
	Melbourne: Former Australia cricketer Mark Waugh feels troubled allrounder Andrew Symonds does not deserve to return to the Test team for the series against New Zealand beginning on Wednesday as he is yet to regain his form.         
	I wouldnt play him. I dont think he deserves to play, Waugh said.         
	Symonds, who was dropped from the national team owing to his go-fishing act, has managed just 80 runs at an average of 13 in first-class cricket for Queensland this season, and Waugh feels that given his present form, the allrounder shouldnt be playing against New Zealand.         
	I dont think hes done enough for Queensland. To me he has looked a little bit flat. I just think he is out of form at the moment.         
	No one has got an automatic selection in the team... Andrew Symonds certainly hasnt. Hes got to do more for Queensland... Im not happy with his return to the team, Waugh was quoted as saying in an Australian daily.         
	Meanwhile, Symonds and Michael Clarke patched up over drinks at a cocktail party, weeks after the two cricketers friendship went sour due to the infamous gone fishing episode.         
	Vice-captain Clarke had supported Symonds ouster from the side after he missed a customary team meeting to go fishing in Darwin.         
	But all was forgotten when the duo came face to face at a party in Brisbane recently.         
	We had a cocktail party last night which was great. We spent a bit of time together having a chat and at training today we did again, Clarke was quoted as saying. (PTI)

   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
        Sourav Ganguly
   
	Sydney: Team India captain Anil Kumble and two predecessors mdash; Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly mdash; as also Wasim Jaffer and Zaheer Khan made Test crickets top 10 in different categories in 2007.
 
	Barring Sachin, who briefly spoke to The Telegraph at the Radisson Plaza on Monday evening, the others offered their comments during the 75-minute Qantas flight from Melbourne earlier in the day. 
 
	Here goes (alphabetically): 
 
	SOURAV GANGULY (No. 2 among batsmen with 1,106 runs and No. 2 among allrounders with 6 wickets): Being behind (Jacques) Kallis in the allrounders category too is a pleasant surprise... Makes me feel real good... With the bat, my most satisfying knock was against Pakistan in Bangalore mdash; 239 in the first innings... As an allrounder, it will be the Trent Bridge Test, where I got 79 in the first innings and bowled well... 
      Wasim Jaffer
   
	WASIM JAFFER (No. 7 among batsmen with 838 runs): Really? Thats very good news... I had no idea... Hopefully, Ill do better in 2008... Get more runs and play a bigger role in Indian wins... The one innings which gave most satisfaction was 116 in the years first Test, in Cape Town... I hadnt got runs in the first two Tests of that series... Also, South Africas attack was of a high quality... 
      Zaheer Khan
   
	ZAHEER KHAN (No. 4 among bowlers with 41 wickets): Id been aiming to finish in the top 3... I suppose I would have got there had I not missed the Bangalore Test versus Pakistan... Actually, I bowled an unbelievable number of overs in 2007 and my priority is to last the season... As for my most satisfying performance, it has to be the Trent Bridge Test, where I got nine wickets and became the MoM...
      Anil Kumble
   
	ANIL KUMBLE (No. 2 among bowlers with 49 wickets, the same as Muttiah Muralidharan, but the Sri Lankan played two Tests less): I really dont look at such things... Dont go into ratings and rankings... My one performance which gave most satisfaction, I suppose, will be the 5 for 84 on the first day at the MCG...
      Sachin Tendulkar
   
	SACHIN TENDULKAR (No. 9 among batsmen with 776 runs and No. 4 among allrounders with 5 wickets): Oh, is it that Im at No. 9 among batters? Well... Will I be at the top in 2008? Dont know... As youre aware, I dont believe in making predictions...

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev wins in Japan
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeev wins in Japan
                  Jeev Milkha Singh                     
	Hokkaido: A sensational final round of six-under 66 fetched Jeev Milkha Singh his second title of the season  third on Japan tour  at the Nagashima Shigeo invitational Sega Sammy Cup here today.         
	Overnight fourth, Jeev produced his best card of the week to aggregate 13-under 275, equalling the tournament record set by Lin Keng-Chi, to clinch the silverware ahead of Sushi Ishigaki (72) who finished two shots behind.         
	This is Jeevs second title of the season, following his Bank Austria Open triumph in Vienna.         
	Jeevs two previous triumphs on Japan tour came in 2006 when he won back-to-back titles in Casio World Open and Golf Nippon Series JT Cup.         
	Needing something special to have a shot at the title, Jeev responded with a near-perfect round which had the lone blemish on the 12th hole where he dropped a bogey.         
	But that was just an aberration as the Indian sunk as many as seven birdies -- three over his last four holes -- for the sensational win.           (PTI)

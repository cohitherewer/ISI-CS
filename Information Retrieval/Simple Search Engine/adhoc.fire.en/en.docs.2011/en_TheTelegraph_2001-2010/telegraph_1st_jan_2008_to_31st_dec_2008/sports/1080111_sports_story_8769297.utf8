	Calcutta: The return leg of the East Bengal-Mohun Bagan ONGC I-league clash will be held on January 21. The match was originally scheduled a day earlier. 
    
	The change was caused by a couple of religious festivals. 
    
	The IFA may have to reschedule a few more matches since the Salt Lake Stadium is unlikely to be available from January 23 to 31 owing to the state games. East Bengal are scheduled to host Dempo (January 27) and Air India (January 30) while Mohun Bagan are slated to take on Churchill Brothers on January 31.

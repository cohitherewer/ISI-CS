The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fletcher bails out United
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fletcher bails out United
                      
	London: Champions Manchester United recorded their first win of the Premier League season when Darren Fletchers scruffy goal secured a 1-0 triumph at Portsmouth on Monday.         
	Fletcher was credited with turning the ball in from Patrice Evras centre in the 32nd minute although Portsmouth defender Sylvain Distin appeared to make contact with the cross and Sol Campbell also got a touch in a vain attempt to keep it out.         
	It was the second goal in as many games for the Scotland midfielder after he also found the net in last weeks 1-1 draw with Newcastle United.         
	United manager Alex Ferguson praised Fletcher, who is getting a run in the team due to the injuries and suspensions keeping out Cristiano Ronaldo, Nani and Park Ji-sung.         
	He (Fletcher) is great at making those runs (into the penalty box), Ferguson said. He has got fantastic energy and Im really delighted hes getting the credit he deserves.         
	Wayne Rooney also beat Portsmouth keeper David James with a shot early in the second half but had the effort ruled out for offside.         
	For FA Cup holders Portsmouth, defeat continued their unhappy start to the season after losing the Community Shield to United on penalties and their league opener 0-4 at Chelsea.         
	United climbed within two points of Chelsea, and are behind Liverpool, Blackburn and newly promoted Hull on goal difference.           (REUTERS)

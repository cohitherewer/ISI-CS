                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mahela: Extra batsman did the job
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene attributed the consolation win against India on Friday to his decision of playing the extra batsman.         
	The win at the Premadasa Stadium helped Sri Lanka finish the five-match series with two victories.         
	The Lankans played with seven regular batsmen and a crucial 94-run seventh wicket partnership between Jehan Mubarak and Thilan Tushara helped them reach 227 in their 50 overs. Man of the match Nuwan Kulasekharas spell of four for 40 in nine overs helped his side skittle out India for a paltry 103 runs.         
	Following is what the two captains and Nuwan Kulasekara had to say:         
	Jayawardene: This win was a good way to finish the series. But one shouldnt take anything away from the Indians, they played some very good cricket and deserved to win the series. But credit to our boys as well, theyve played good cricket over the last two months or sothe boys showed good character. In this series, we kept making mistakes, especially in the batting department. Today (Friday) we went with a different combination and it workedwe need to adapt to the conditions.         
	M.S. Dhoni: It was important to win the toss today (Friday), because at the Premadasa it does a bit in the evening. There was help for the fast bowlers as well as the spinners. Contribution from everyone mattered in this series win, we prepared well because we really wanted to win here.         
	Someone or the other is bound to get runs and it is up to those batsmen to carry on.         
	Raina did well, I batted well, Gautam and Kohli also contributed.         
	The fast bowlers did very well and Harbhajan was awesome. In the end, we won the games that mattered, but they played better cricket.         
	Kulasekara (MoM): There was a bit of movement. I knew that the ball would seam around a bit in the night and I did my best. I increased my pace midway through the innings.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: When the Beijing bound Indian wrestling squad was given a farewell at an obscure west Delhi hotel, the attendance was thin. None expected the three-member team to perform miracles and the discussion centred around the dipping fortunes of Indian wrestling.         
	Today, a 25-year-old boy from Najafgarh, who answers to the name of Sushil Kumar, has single-handedly taken the sport to a height that has surpassed the deeds of some of his illustrious predecessors.         
	Instantly labelled as a serious challenger to Virender Sehwags undisputed crown of Nawab of Najafgarh, Sushil is known in the wrestling circle more for his tenacity than combative skills. To those who know him for years, it is Sushils never-say-die attitude that has often helped him to do better than many of his talented colleagues.         
	On Thursday, at the Beijing Agriculture University Complex, Sushil fought four continuous bouts but refused to go back to the Athletes Village to take rest after two bouts. It was typical of Sushil, who does not believe in deserting the ring midway through. Born in a middle class family, Sushil resisted many provocations to say good bye to the sport and decided to pursue his dream of an Olympic medal.         
	Sushils father, Diwan Singh, a former wrestler himself, is employed as a driver with the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited in Delhi. He could not generate enough cash but provided priceless encouragement.         
	Without his father, Sushil would not have taken up wrestling at the age of 10.         
	Apart from his father, the 1982 Asian Games gold medalist Satpal and his long-time coach Yashbir Singh have also played a major role in taking Sushil this far.         
	The Indian wrestler really gave himself a chance of winning an Olympic medal since 2006 when he bagged the gold at the Commonwealth Games and a bronze in the Asian Games at Doha.

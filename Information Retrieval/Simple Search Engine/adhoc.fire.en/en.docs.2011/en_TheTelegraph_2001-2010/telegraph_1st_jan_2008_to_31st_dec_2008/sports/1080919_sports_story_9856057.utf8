	Mike Ashley suffered a setback on Wednesday to his attempts to sell Newcastle United in the Middle East. The Newcastle owners hopes of offloading the club to the Dubai Investment Group effectively vanished when DIG confirmed that they had not taken part in talks to buy the club, and had no plans to do so.         
	A DIG statement said: Following incorrect media speculation, Dubai Investment Group can confirm that it is not involved in any negotiations to buy Newcastle FC, nor does it plan to do so in the future.         
	The Newcastle owner was reported to have snubbed a meeting with potential buyers in Dubai because they were only ready to offer him 200million well short of the 481million price-tag Ashley slapped on Newcastle in documents handed to representatives of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.         
	In the wake of that disappointment, it emerged that a middleman, believed to be club vice-president Tony Jimenez, had contacted former Football League chairman Keith Harris to help find Ashley a buyer.         
	While the Newcastle owner was struggling to sell the club in Dubai, managing director Derek Llambias was considering a move for a stop-gap manager to replace Kevin Keegan, Former Leeds manager David Leary and Alan Curbishley, who left West Ham earlier this month, are thought to be potential candidates.

                                                    We are in pretty good spot: Lee

         Brett Lee celebrates after dismissing Wasim Jaffer in Perth on Wednesday 
          
	Perth: After a three-wicket haul on the opening day of the third Test against India, Australian spearhead Brett Lee said his team would look to roll over the visitors as early as possible because the Waca track may get quicker. 
    
	It was a good wicket. I expect it to get quicker on Thursday. The second new ball is crucial. We would try to take a wicket or two with it to move into a good position, Lee told reporters after end of play on Day I. 
    
	Lee said that the Indians had some good partnerships but the dismissals of Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman late in the day have put the hosts in a good position. 
    
	They (Indians) had a couple of good partnerships. Dravid batted really well, Sehwag took his chances But at 297 for six, Australia are in a pretty good spot right now, Lee said. 
    
	Australias over-rate was an issue and Lee claimed that it had also to do with a lot of stoppages. 
    
	When four quicks are operating on a hot day, its very difficult to keep up the over-rate. Today there were a lot of stoppages too. 
    
	The speedster said it was a pretty hot day in the middle which taxed his team to the utmost. 
    
	It was pretty hot and was all about hanging in. When you see sea gulls moving around with their mouth open, you can understand how warm it was, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chanderpaul sparks revival
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chanderpaul sparks revival
                      
	Kingston: Australia were reeling at 17 for four at the end of Day III of the first Test which was fascinatingly poised after a spell of ferocious opening bowling from the West Indies.         
	Australia lead by 136 runs with six first-innings wickets remaining. A brave century from West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul, after he was struck on the head by a Brett Lee bouncer, was the highlight of the hosts innings of 312, chasing Australias 431.         
	A middle-order batting collapse  with Lee taking three of four wickets that fell for just eight runs  meant Australia looked in firm control, at least until they returned to the crease for their second innings.         
	Fidel Edwards claimed Phil Jaques before Daren Powell grabbed the vital wicket of Australia captain Ricky Ponting who edged to Dwayne Bravo at third slip and suddenly the tourists were wobbling. The wobble became a tremble when Simon Katich was trapped leg-before by an Edwards yorker and Powell removed Michael Hussey with a beautiful delivery that moved away and hit the off-stump.

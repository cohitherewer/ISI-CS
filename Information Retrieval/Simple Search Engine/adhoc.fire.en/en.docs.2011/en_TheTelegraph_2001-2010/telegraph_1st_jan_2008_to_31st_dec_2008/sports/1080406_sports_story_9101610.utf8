	Port of Spain: Sri Lanka clawed their way back into the second Test on Friday, snapping up six West Indies wickets in the final session to leave the match finely balanced.         
	The home team were 268 for seven at the close on Day II, having gone into tea on 133 for one in reply to Sri Lankas 278 all out.         
	Off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan did most of the damage, removing Ramnaresh Sarwan (57), Marlon Samuels (3) and Devon Smith (47).         
	There were some positives from the hosts batting with debutant opener Sewnarine Chattergoon scoring 46 before he was bowled by Chaminda Vaas and captain Chris Gayle produced a hard-hitting 45 that dealt with some of the concerns about his ability to deal with Vaass left-arm swing.         
	Smith, an opener who was dropped down to number six, looked confident in his knock but fell to a doosra from Muralidharan just five balls before play was ended due to bad light.         
	Sri Lanka began the day on 217 for five but lost their last five wickets for just 61 runs.                 (REUTERS)

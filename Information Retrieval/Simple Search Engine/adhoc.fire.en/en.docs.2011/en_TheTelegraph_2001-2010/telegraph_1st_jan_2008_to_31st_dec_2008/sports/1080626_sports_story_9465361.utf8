	Sydney: Jane McGrath, the wife of former Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath, was given the farewell at an emotional funeral on Wednesday.         
	English-born Jane died at her Sydney home on Sunday at the age of 42, triggering a national outpouring of grief for a woman who won the hearts of her adopted nation throughout her long and public battle with cancer. Mourners, led by the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and a number of Test cricketers including Shane Warne, Steve Waugh and Adam Gilchrist, crammed into the same Sydney church where Jane and Glenn were married almost a decade ago.         
	Hundreds of people lined the streets outside, standing in silence as her white coffin was carried into the 165-year-old colonial church and fighting back tears as the couples two young children James and Holly released three white doves and blew soap bubbles into the air. Alan Jones, an Australian broadcaster and former coach of the national rugby team, said Jane would be remembered as a woman of great courage whose tireless work in promoting awareness about breast cancer was an enduring source of inspiration.         
	Every day was a battle, yet paradoxically everyday she sought to strengthen others in their same battle, he said. That alone required enormous energy and untold reserves and resources, yet in spite of her ability to relieve the burden of others, her own burdens continued to build.         
	Janes best friend, Tracy Bevan, the wife of former Australia allrounder Michael, struggled to contain her emotions as she addressed the congregation. The Jane McGrath I know is loving, kind, generous, extremely funny, creative, sensitive, a loyal wife, a loving mother and the best friend anyone could ever have, she said. Ill miss her every day until I see her again. (REUTERS)

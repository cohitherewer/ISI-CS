      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Perth: Im just plain happy... Im not under pressure... Its good to be here, Billy Bowden, the controversial Steve Bucknors replacement for the third Test, told The Telegraph. 
    
	Asad Rauf, who will be the other on-field umpire, said: Im focused on the job at hand... I dont have to look back at what happened in Sydney... 
    
	The third Test begins on Wednesday and its reasonable to say that there will be as much attention on the two umpires as on the Sachin Tendulkars and the Brett Lees.

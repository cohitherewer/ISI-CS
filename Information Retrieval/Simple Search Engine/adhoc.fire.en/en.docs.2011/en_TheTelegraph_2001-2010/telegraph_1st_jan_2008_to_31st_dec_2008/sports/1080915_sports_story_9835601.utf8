The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICL threat for Bangladesh
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ICL threat for Bangladesh
                      
	Dhaka: Six Bangladesh cricketers, including former captain Habibul Bashar have applied for retirement, a top official of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said on Sunday.         
	Shahriar Nafees and Aftab Ahmed, allrounder Farhad Reza, wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh and left-arm spinner Mosharraf Hossain along with Bashar did not give any reason for early retirement.         
	But a local media report on Sunday said at least 14 leading Bangladesh cricketers, including Bashar, were about to join the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	The 36-year-old Bashar revealed he had been in discussions with the ICL but had not signed a contract yet.         
	I can say only about myself that I have got the proposal from the ICL and am talking with them. But nothing has yet been finalised, he said.         
	Gazi Ashraf Hossain, chairman of the boards cricket operations committee said: We have summoned all the six players to appear before the board on Tuesday to explain the reasons for retirement.         
	Ashraf said the players should not quit on a whim.         
	They should understand that the board had played a big role in their development as cricketers. The players dropped the letters by courier at the BCB before the office opened on Sunday.         
	Bashar is Bangladeshs most successful captain, having led them to their maiden Test win and to 29 one-day International victories.         
	He is also the countrys leading Test run scorer with 3,026 runs.         
	Besides the six, a Dhaka-based Bengali daily also identified Mohammed Rafique, Alok Kapali, Nazim Uddin, Manjurul Islam, Tapash Baishya, Mohammed Sharif, Mahbubul Karim and Golam Mabud as planning to join ICL.

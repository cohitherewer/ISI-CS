The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting, Hayden on course for India tour
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ponting, Hayden on course for India tour
  - Border-Gavaskar trophy
  -   Good news for Australia after Symonds controversy                    Ricky Ponting                     
	Melbourne: The Australian think-tank heaved a sigh of relief with batting mainstays Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden recovering fast from injuries to reach India next month to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.         
	The duo will have to play crucial roles if Australia are to beat India in their own backyard, considered one of the toughest cricket assignments. With Ponting recovering fast from a wrist surgery and Hayden overcoming an Achilles problem, coach Tim Nielsen said there was nothing to worry about the duo.         
	Ricky saw (physio) Alex (Kountouris) in Sydney. The feedback was pretty solid, all good. He has just started batting again as well, Nielsen said.         
	On Hayden, he said, everything has been progressing exactly as liked.         
	Hayden has not played since last summer and both he and Ponting missed the ODI series against Bangladesh in Darwin.         
	With embattled all-rounder Andrew Symonds  sent home due to what is perceived as his sagging commitment towards the team  likely to miss the India tour, the team management is worried that it might weaken Australias batting prowess.         
	Though Symonds has got in touch with sports psychologist Phil Jauncey to help him cope with the crisis, the team management is not taking chances and seemed to have found a logical replacement in Shane Watson.         
	Until we have finalised everything with Roy (Symonds) and made those decisions, were probably not really willing to talk about it, to be honest, Nielsen said.                   Hayden      
	Earlier this month, Brett Lee declared himself ready to tour India after taking time away from the game to deal with the break-up of his marriage.         
	The players depart for India on September 21 and Lee said there was no doubt he would be available. Absolutely, Im looking forward to it, Lee said. I cant wait. However, it was only earlier this week that Lee made up his mind that he was mentally prepared for the four-Test tour.         
	Its only been the last couple of days (that I decided), Lee said. Its been one of those things where it was just going to be a time thing, so if it didnt work out and I didnt think I was fit enough or I wasnt ready to go, more so mentally ... but Im feeling great on both fronts and Im actually looking forward to it.         
	Lee was originally named in the squad to take on Bangladesh in three one-day Internationals but he was later granted leave by Cricket Australia when he informed them of his personal circumstances. Lee considered whether it would be best to miss the India trip but his break during the Darwin games and the postponement of the Champions Trophy helped him decide.

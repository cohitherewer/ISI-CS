                                                                                                                                                                                                     Swiss and Turks aim for fair play
                      
	Feusisberg (Switzerland): Switzerland and Turkey will aim to put the ugly scenes that marred their last encounter behind them when they meet at Euro 2008 on Wednesday.         
	Media in both countries have been focusing for weeks on the violence that followed Switzerlands World Cup qualifying play-off victory in Istanbul in November 2005.         
	But with the teams facing the possibility of an early exit from the tournament after opening game defeats, they have insisted they are concentrating purely on the present.         
	Of course, its not easy to forget what happened in Istanbul, Swiss midfielder Tranquillo Barnetta told reporters on Monday. But we are trying not to dwell on it.         
	Turkey have steered clear of discussing the Istanbul match at their own news conferences but coach Fatih Terim has spoken in the past of his sides desire to put the matter behind them.         
	Switzerland lost the Istanbul encounter 2-4 but denied Turkey a place at the 2006 World Cup on away goals, thanks to their 2-0 victory in the first leg in Berne.         
	The Swiss success was overshadowed by the subsequent clashes between players and coaching staff that saw Switzerland defender Stephane Grichting taken to hospital after a kick in the groin.         
	Police and security officials said on Monday that Wednesdays reunion was higher risk than other matches in Switzerland.         
	However, Uefa said it was not planning increased security measures inside the stadium.           (REUTERS)

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bolt to train with Real Madrid
    - Off the track, Powell and I are good friends                 Usain Bolt                           
	Paris: Olympic champion Usain Bolt has agreed to go training with Spanish football giants Real Madrid, the Jamaican sprint king revealed.         
	Bolt, who picked up three golds medals and world records in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay at the Bejing Games, said on Thursday he was particularly looking forward to meeting Reals former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy.         
	Raul and Van Nistelrooy, I think theyre some of the best goalscorers ever, Bolt told www.laureus.com.         
	Ive watched Van Nistelrooy from when he was with Manchester United, so I know hes a great, great guy so I look forward to meeting these guys.         
	Bolt believes sprint rivals Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay will come out firing in 2009, determined to mount a supercharged response to his record-breaking exploits.         
	Powell, the former 100m world record holder was a poor fifth in the Olympic final while American Gay, the world champion, missed the final after seeing his preparations hit by a hamstring injury.         
	Its going to be a major thing with me and Asafa, Bolt said. Also Tyson. He was injured so hes coming back even better next season. Its all about business because its our job and we go out there to be champions, so Im definitely looking forward to next season.         
	Its going to be bigger next year because I think hell be in better shape early in the season to do great things, so Im definitely looking forward to that.         
	The trio are set to dominate sprinting next year with the highlight of their rivalry being the world championships in Berlin.         
	Bolt also insists that he and Powell are close despite many in the sport believing the Jamaican duo enjoy a frosty relationship. Were friends, said Bolt. We are known to mess around, we laugh, and stuff like that. But when were on the track, its all about competition. But off the track were good friends, were good buds, we talk.         
	The Olympic champion believes that he has even learnt from Powell. Ive seen him run. It motivates you to either try to do better or to try to do great stuff. So, definitely, when I came into this, he definitely motivated me.         
	Bolt also explained the thinking behind his extravagant gestures on the track.         
	My body (language) is just a gesture to the world. Its a thing we do in Jamaica. Its actually a dance, but I just took it and turned it into my move. After the 100m, I did a dance called The Sweep and after the 200m I did one called The Gutty Cooper.

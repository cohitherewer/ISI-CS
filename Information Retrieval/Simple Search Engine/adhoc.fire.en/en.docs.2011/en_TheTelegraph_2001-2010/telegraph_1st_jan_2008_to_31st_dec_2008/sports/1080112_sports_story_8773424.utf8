      Sachins advice for Yuvraj
        
	 Yuvraj Singh has been asked to bowl in order to improve his batting and he takes this advice rather seriously as it comes from none other than Sachin Tendulkar. Sachin spent a great deal of time in the nets with the left-hander before the start of the three-day game in order to put the exciting stroke-player back on track. Yuvraj has been an utter failure in the series so far, struggling to last a dozen deliveries, and Sachin believed his advice to the princely left-hander can no longer wait. 
    
	Sachin wanted Yuvraj to bowl a fair deal in the nets and in side games in order to gauge the bounce on Australian pitches. 
    
	The Punjab batsman has been advised not to go for his shots as soon as he comes to the crease on these wickets. Sachin cited the example of his unbeaten 154 in Sydney where he did not go for hook or pull shots even when he was in his 90s. At least, dont go for your horizontal shots till you are truly in, Sachin is believed to have told Yuvraj. 
    
	Aussies play fair, insists Marsh 
    
	 Amid mounting criticism of the Australian teams alleged lack of sportsmanship, the countrys players association chief Paul Marsh defended the world champions on Friday claiming they were second to none in fair play. Marsh said Test cricket was a tough game and the Australians tested their opponents in terms of their skills as well as physical and mental toughness. Test cricket is not tiddlywinks. It is a true test of not only a players skills but their mental and physical toughness, he said. 
    
	These are traits that Australia as a nation has been built upon, he asserted. The Australian cricket team plays the game hard but fair. They test their opponents in all three of the above areas, but rarely nowadays cross the line, he said. Marsh said he was taken aback by the criticism as he felt the players did not deserve the harsh verbal lashing. 
    
	Madugalle confident 
    
	 The International Cricket Councils (ICC) peacemaker, Ranjan Madugalle, is confident he can restore order to the Australia-India Test series following the damaging Bollyline saga. 
    
	Madugalle is due to arrive in Perth on Saturday, and will likely meet warring captains Ricky Ponting and Anil Kumble the following day. Speaking to an Australian daily from Colombo, Madugalle said his previous dealings with Ponting and Kumble had led him to believe both were reasonable men, well capable of reaching an amicable arrangement to end the damaging feud between their two teams. 
    
	I have an open briefing to get things back on track. I will try and go about things quietly and do as much as I can without making too much noise about it. Well see at the end of the five days if it has worked, but I am optimistic that everyone wants to do the right thing. 
    
	Ponting last night appeared on an Australian television for the second time in a week, this time promoting a message of reconciliation. Ill go out of my way to make sure it (reconciliation) happens, Ponting said. Well have a chat to ensure a better game of cricket for audiences around the world. 
    
	Roebuck picks Katich 
    
	 Simon Katich is the man to captain the Australian team in the event of any further calamities befalling the national side. 
    
	It is not that the selectors lack alternatives or are obliged to choose their leader from within the squad chosen for the Perth Test match. Some of the players will retire soon and the opportunity will arise to chart a different course. Everything depends on the response of the players in the next few weeks. 
    
	It is not that they need to placate a single cranky reporter. They need to reassure the Australian public that they mean to represent the country not only with skill and dedication, but also with grace. It has been missing. It is not so long ago that a distinguished politician was unceremoniously pushed off a podium.

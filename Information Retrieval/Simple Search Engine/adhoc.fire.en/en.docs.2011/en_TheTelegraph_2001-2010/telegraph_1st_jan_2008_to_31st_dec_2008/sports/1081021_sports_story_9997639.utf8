The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies in dire straits
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Aussies in dire straits
            SUDIPTO GANGULY              Harbhajan Singh and Mahendra SIngh Dhoni celebrate the dismissal of Simon Katich on the fourth day of   the second Test in Mohali on Monday. (AP)                            
	Mohali: India set Australia an imposing target of 516 runs and then returned to pack off half the Australian side on the fourth day of the second Test here on Monday. Australia are reeling at 141/5 and still need a mammoth 375 runs on the last day to win the match.         
	The visitors have a Herculean task of batting out the 90 overs on Tuesday to save the Test  on a fifth day pitch against two quality spinners and the reverse-swinging ball. Thus it can be safely said that only two results look possible from here on  an Indian victory or a draw.         
	The Indians, however, cant afford to be complacent. In March 2005, Pakistan had denied India a victory at the same venue courtesy a 184-run partnership in the second innings between Kamran Akmal (109) and Abdul Razzaq (71). The duo had batted for 52.3 overs on the last day to save the match for visitors Pakistan.         
	Australia have the last recognised pair of vice-captain Michael Clarke (42 ..) and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (37 ..) at the crease and would need a miracle to save Australia from going down 0-1 in the four-match Test series. The pair has added 83 runs for the sixth wicket, and would have to stay at the crease for a long period to give their team any chance of avoiding defeat.         
	What would worry Australian supporters more is that the side is not looking like a team whose members back each other. Captain Ricky Ponting kept Brett Lee out of the attack for the whole of the first session, which gave rise to speculation of a rift between the two. The Australian captain even bowled Mike Hussey (medium-pace) for eight overs in the session before lunch.         
	Australia coach Tim Nielsen, however, defended the decision of not letting Lee bowl in the first session. We wanted to take the pace off the ball in the first session to stop the flow of runs. Thats why we didnt bowl Lee. Both Sourav and Dhoni, who were batting then, like the ball coming on to their bat, he explained. But Lees unhappiness was there for everyone to see.         
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni declared the second innings at the total of 315 for three, just after the drinks break in the second session of the day.         
	Opener Gautam Gambhir completed his second Test century  his first against Australia, before falling to leg-spinner Cameron White.         
	Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma then combined to pick up five Australian wickets. Harbhajans three-wicket haul on Monday took his tally of Test wickets to 299. Ishant bowled a fiery second spell after tea to pick up two crucial wickets  that of Ponting and Shane Watson.         
	Ishants second spell figures read  6-4-12-2. The lanky pacer, for sure, has developed quite a liking for Ponting. He dismissed the right-hander once again with a beautiful in-swinger.         
	The ball swung in from outside the off-stump and breached Pontings defence to dislodge the stumps. There was very little gap between the bat and the pad, but Ishant still managed to sneak through.         
	The pacer, who bowled regularly above the 140 kmph mark, trapped Watson in front of the stumps with a similar kind of delivery that bowled Ponting.         
	Harbhajan picked up both Australian openers in the over before tea. Both Hayden and Katich were going great guns till then and had raced to 49 in only seven overs.         
	Dhonis introduction of the feisty off-spinner into the attack turned out to be the masterstroke. Harbhajan got Hayden out with his second ball and Katich with the last ball of the over.         
	Hayden, who has been struggling for runs in this series, went for a sweep to a full-length delivery. The ball struck him in line with the off-stump and umpire Asad Rauf ruled him out lbw.         
	Katich fell to a brilliant catch by Sachin Tendulkar at point. He tried to square drive a flighted one from Harbhajan outside the off-stump, but the ball spun away from him and took the edge. Tendulkar dived in front to take the catch inches off the ground.         
	Mike Hussey misjudged the length of a Harbhajan delivery and went for a pull. The ball was not short enough for the horizontal bat shot and Hussey was caught plumb in front of the stumps.         
	Indias openers  Virender Sehwag and Gambhir  walked out in a very positive frame of mind in the morning. They put on 182 runs (off 237 balls) for the first wicket before Sehwag departed, edging Peter Siddle to Brad Haddin.         
	Sehwag, who turned 30 on Monday, was at his punishing best, and treated the Australian bowlers with utter disdain.         
	Dhoni walked in at the fall of Sehwag to increase the scoring rate. His 84-ball knock consisted of three boundaries and a huge six.         
	Gambhir fell after completing his century, trying to hit Cameron White out of the ground. He miscued the shot and the ball ended in the hands of Hussey at mid-off.         
	Sourav Ganguly (27) was sent in after Gambhirs dismissal, and he combined with Dhoni in a 66-run partnership before holing out to Clarke off Lees bowling. Sachin Tendulkar (10 ..) batted at No.5 for his team after Souravs dismissal.

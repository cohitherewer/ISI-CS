	London: Rain ruined the third day of the first Test between England and New Zealand at Lords on Saturday with only 8.5 overs possible during a frustrating day for players and spectators.         
	In that period, a 40-minute session before lunch, England took their overnight score of 68 for no wicket to 89 without loss in reply to New Zealands first innings 277.         
	Alastair Cook, 43 not out overnight, added 10 runs for his 10th Test half-century compiled from 79 balls with six fours. Andrew Strauss was on 31.         
	Play began 25 minutes late after morning drizzle and the players left the field shortly after mid-day when the rain returned.         
	The rain relented in the afternoon and the sun threatened to break through heavy clouds which have hung over Lords since the test began on Thursday.           (REUTERS)

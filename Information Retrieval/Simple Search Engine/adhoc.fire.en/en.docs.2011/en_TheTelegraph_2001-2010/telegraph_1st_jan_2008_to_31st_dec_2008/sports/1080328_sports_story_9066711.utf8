The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yawning bowler sends wrong signals
                                                     Yawning bowler sends wrong signals
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Calcutta: Neo Sports didnt show the replay and former India opener Arun Lal, who was on the air, let it pass, but its absolutely shocking that one of our bowlers was actually caught yawning within minutes of the commencement of Day II in Chennai.         
	With that being the approach, its not surprising that the South Africans posted their highest Test score in India  540, bettering the 510 for nine on the last tour, in 2004-05.         
	The bowler should, of course, be thanking his stars that he isnt, for example, playing under one Imran Khan or a Nasser Hussain.         
	Such a lack of interest, and that too so early in the day, wouldve infuriated Imran to such an extent that the bowler would almost surely have been out of the series.         
	Well, yes, the consequences wouldve been serious Imran wouldve given a very public dressing down, Ramiz Raja, who played a lot under Pakistans World Cup-winning captain, told The Telegraph.         
	A former captain himself, Ramiz is also on Neos commentary team.         
	Perhaps, Anil Kumble didnt notice that disgraceful act and, so, the Team India Test captain gets the benefit of doubt. Kumble, though, needs to ensure that every single member of his team shares his passion.         
	Incidentally, in the lead-up to the first Test, another player had overslept and, as a result, turned up late for a team meeting!         
	Admittedly, the weather in Chennai isnt great, but one could do without such outrageous happenings.

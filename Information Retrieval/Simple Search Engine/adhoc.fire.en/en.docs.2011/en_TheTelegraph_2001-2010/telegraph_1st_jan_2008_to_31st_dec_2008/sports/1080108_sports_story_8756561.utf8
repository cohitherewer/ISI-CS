	Cullinan faces a new ban

  Durban: Darryl Cullinan has been banned from commentating in the ongoing Test series between South Africa and West Indies for his connection with the Indian Cricket League (ICL). Cullinan, who coached the Calcutta Tigers in the ICL, did not commentate during the second Test in Cape Town and his media accreditation for the third Test, starting in Durban on Thursday, has been withdrawn. 
    
	Cricket South Africa chairman, Norman Arendse, said Cullinan was handed the ban as it would be inappropriate for a person involved with a rebel league to commentate in an official Test. 
    
	Cullinan has expressed dismay at the decision. I am shocked and disappointed. Why is Tony Greig allowed to continue commentating in Australia but I am punished? he said. 
    
	Meanwhile, television group Supersport is holding an urgent meeting with the CSA to resolve the situation. 
       
	Thumbs up for referrals

  Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad on supported the ICCs soon-to-be-introduced referral system, which allows players to appeal against decisions by on-field umpires. The ICC will put the system on trial at the Champions Trophy in Pakistan later this year, under which a team will have the right to make three appeals to the third umpire if they have doubts over a decision made by on-field officials. 
    
	Miandad said umpires were now more prone to go wrong as they made their decisions in a hurry. With the number of mistakes increasing, I think this referral system is good for the game because one bad decision can turn a defeat into a win or vice-versa for any team, he said. 
    
	Zaheer Abbas also backed the system, saying that batsmen also needed a slice of luck like the bowlers.

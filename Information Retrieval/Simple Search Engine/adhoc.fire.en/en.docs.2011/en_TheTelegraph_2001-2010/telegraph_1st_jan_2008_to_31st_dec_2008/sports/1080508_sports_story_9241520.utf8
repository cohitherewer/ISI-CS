The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Salman Butt itching to make presence felt
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Salman Butt itching to make presence felt
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Salman Butt                           
	Calcutta: Salman Butt is in the Kolkata Knight Riders XIV for Thursdays face-off against the Bangalore Royal Challengers, but its to the XI that hes itching to return.         
	I guess the Indian Premier League (IPL) rule about fielding only four overseas players is working to my disadvantage It will be great to again play at the Eden, though, Butt told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, the former Pakistan vice-captain added: There are compulsions for the team management, but Id been looking forward to continuing from where Id left off in the just-ended home (ODI) series against Bangladesh Id much rather be playing than waiting to get a look-in again         
	The five-match affair saw Butt, the MoS, total 451 to average 90-plus. Scoring against Bangladesh doesnt quite enhance ones CV, but being in form does count for much.         
	Those whore struggling in the IPL  and the list includes some really big names  probably know that better than most.         
	Butt, who joined the squad late (because of his Pakistan commitments), has only made one IPL appearance  in Jaipur, against the Rajasthan Royals, where he managed just 7.         
	While Butts last appearance at the Eden was during the second Test, last November-December, his first had been in November 2004 during the one-off Platinum Jubilee ODI.         
	Then barely out of his teens, Butt remained not out on 108 and guided Pakistan to a six-wicket win.         
	However, thats long gone by. Today, making the XI is Butts priority.         
	I need to be batting well as days after the IPL is the short tri-series in Bangladesh, Butt pointed out.         
	The other day, Knight Riders coach John Buchanan picked Butt as one of the players who could stand up and have a presence.         
	Its to be seen whether Buchanan will give Butt the chance to make his presence felt.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its do or die for England
                                                                                                                                                                                           Its do or die for England
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kanpur: India would look to extend their domination when they take on hapless England in the third of the seven-match ODI series at the Green Park Stadium here on Thursday.         
	The hosts already have a 2-0 lead in the series and if England lose again, that would make it very difficult for them to come back.         
	The Indian bowling department would be bolstered by the fact that speedster Ishant Sharma has been declared fit to play. Ishant had missed the first two matches of the series owing to an ankle injury.         
	Zaheer Khan, who might be rested on Thursday, could make way for Ishant. The decision to rest Zaheer was not taken till Wednesday evening but according to some of those who matter, the team management want to play Ishant and rest Zaheer.         
	The visitors were dealt a blow when Ryan Sidebottom complained of discomfort in his back and was sent for a scan.         
	Off-spinner Graeme Swann, who played a key role in a famous away win in Sri Lanka a year ago, has been drafted into Englands XII.         
	Swann is tipped to play on Thursday in place of left-arm spinner Samit Patel, unless England decide to drop one of their ineffective fast bowlers.         
	Whatever may be the England bowling attack, they have their task cut out against the Indian batsmen who are on song. If Yuvraj Singh gets going again, it might well be curtains for the visitors.         
	Three batsmen have scored three ODI centuries in a row  Zaheer Abbas, Saeed Anwar and Herschelle Gibbs  and the kind of form Yuvraj is in, he will definitely give it a shot. He has already shown that he can mould his batting according to the demand of the situation. If the first century in Rajkot was a blistering one, the second in Indore was more of a sedate one.         
	England captain Kevin Pietersen and his bowlers have looked completely helpless before Yuvrajs assault and would have to devise a way of getting the southpaws wicket.         
	Pietersen will also need to spare some thought about his batting line-up. England definitely seem to lack the fire-power at the top of the order when the ball is hard and new. The England captain will mull the option of promoting himself or the talented Ravi Bopara.         
	The form of Rohit Sharma is the only concern in the strong Indian batting line-up. The talented right-hander has been severely short of runs since the Sri Lanka tour. He has to score runs or make way for the Virat Kohlis and the Murali Vijays.         
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has utilised his part-time spinners very cleverly and that has taken the pressure off Harbhajan Singh.         
	Both captains will want to bat first after winning the toss on a wicket which looks very promising for stroke play.         
	The pitch curator at Green Park Stadium has predicted a batting paradise. The bounce would be even, ball would come nicely onto the bat and the stroke-makers would make merry, said Shiv Kumar.         
	So far, the 294 India scored against Pakistan remains the highest at Green Park. I dont rule out a 300-plus score on Thursday.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): M.S. Dhoni (captain), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma/Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, RP Singh.         
	England (from): Kevin Pietersen (captain), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad, Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison, Samit Patel, Matt Prior, Owais Shah, Graeme Swann.         
	Umpires: Amish Saheba, Russell Tiffin; TV: Suresh Shastri.         
	Match starts: 9am.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Felt my heart would explode: Champion
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Felt my heart would explode: Champion
            Simon Arron                      
	An electric storm did its best to dampen Lewis Hamiltons champagne moment in the gathering gloom of the Interlagos paddock on Sunday evening, but he didnt mind the rain. He stood there beaming, and pleading speechlessness, which was probably not what a clamouring throng of TV reporters needed to hear.         
	Hamiltons last-gasp fifth place secured less than half a lap from the end of the Brazilian Grand Prix, made him the youngest world champion in the 59-season history of the Formula One world championship (as reported in Mondays City edition).         
	I dont think it has hit home yet, said Hamilton, edging ever close to his teams garage wall to avoid being consumed by the media scrum. It was the most intense race of my life and my heart is still pumping. Id like to thank McLaren for giving me a wonderful car and my family for being here to support me. Im thankful to everyone who has given me this opportunity.         
	Honestly, I felt as though my heart was about to explode in the closing stages of the race. I dont know how I kept my cool. I was fortunate on the last lap, but Ive done it. It was such a tough race, the toughest of my life.         
	He blamed tyre problems for the lack of pace that made him easy prey for Sebastian Vettel shortly after both drivers had switched to wet tyres in the races final moments. Vettel moved ahead on lap 69, knocking Hamilton back to sixth and giving Massa a slender advantage in the title race. On the final lap, though, Toyota driver Timo Glock  who had gambled on sticking with dry tyres  slowed in the increasing rain and Hamilton recovered the extra point he required.         
	My tyres were beginning to grain, Hamilton said, and it was all I could do to stay on the track. My heart was in my mouth, but then I had a chance to get past Glock. We came, we saw and we did what we needed to do.         
	McLaren team principal Ron Dennis denied there was any particular sinking feeling when Vettel passed his talisman. This is a heroes to zeroes sport, he said. This was a day when you just had to make the calls as the race evolved. We were fairly sure there was a lot of rain coming and in the end our strategy turned out to be right. Lewis is a very special talent. Hes the youngest ever world champion and hes done it so well.         
	Hamiltons father Anthony was, like his son, struggling to find the right words. This is the culmination of 16 years of hard work, he said, and we have to hope this is inspirational for other families and kids. We had no money when we started out but now were here on top of the world. The reality is that it can be done.         
	Emotions were running high in another family, too. The Massa clan were just starting to celebrate when the reality of the final half-lap dawned. Winner Massa  who has taken six victories this year, one more than Hamilton  crossed the line 13.2sec ahead of Fernando Alonso and then faced an interminable wait to learn how his rival had fared. He was in tears at the end and happy to admit as much.         
	I dont cry a lot, he said, but today it was difficult not to. Perhaps its my age I had really mixed emotions, racing at home here in front of the Brazilian people. We did everything absolutely right. We can be proud of our race and our championship campaign. Now I need to concentrate on celebrating this victory and then looking ahead to next year.         
	This time last year Hamilton left Brazil having missed the title by one point. Massa, another worthy loser, now knows how that feels.

                                                   Close shave for Federer

 - Kuznetsova, Gonzalez upset; hewitt survives five-setter 
           
	Melbourne: Roger Federer reckons the four-and-a-half hours that he spent struggling to survive at the Australian Open might turn a few of his hairs grey. 
    
	There was never a let-up in the tension as Federer was forced repeatedly to rally from behind before outlasting 49th-ranked Janko Tipsarevic 6-7, 7-6, 5-7, 6-1, 10-8 on Saturday to advance to the fourth round of the tournament he has won the last two years. 
    
	Tipsarevic, who has never has reached a singles final, played the match of his life and threw every trick in his bag at Federer. 
    
	Even though I came out as a loser from todays match I think I learned a lot, a sanguine Tipsarevic told reporters. I hope I earned some respect from the players around the world. Surprisingly, Im not feeling that bad. Federer needed every one of his personal best 39 aces  14 more than his previous mark in one match  to fend off the challenge from the 2001 Australian Open junior champion. 
    
	What a great battle, the world No. 1 said. This is where you get grey hair early in life. I dont often get to play five-setters unless theyre against Nadal at Wimbledon, Federer said of his rivalry with long-time No. 2-ranked Rafael Nadal. 
    
	In the last match of the day, home favourite Lleyton Hewitt survived a stunning collapse in the early hours of Sunday morning to beat Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-7, 6-3 in a titanic third-round clash at the Australian Open. 
    
	In a match that ended at 4.33am, the latest finish at a Grand Slam event, Hewitt blew a 5-1 lead in the fourth set and a match point at 5-2 but recovered to win the decider and line up a meeting with third seed Novak Djokovic of Serbia. 
    
	Federer was untouchable in his first two matches, dropping only six games in six sets. On Saturday, he had numerous chances to take control, but Tipsarevic saved 16 of 20 break points against him until Federer finally cashed in on No. 21 after rallying from 0-40 as the Serbian served at 8-8 in the fifth set. 
    
	I had to block out all the chances I missed, said Federer, who next faces No. 12 Tomas Berdych, a four-set winner over No. 21 Juan Monaco. He came up with some fantastic plays and played me well. 
    
	Tipsarevic said his strategy was simple. 
    
	Be aggressive, and then try to make him work for the points that hes winning. Against Roger its so hard, because hes playing every point. Even when youre up like 40-0, the game is far, far from over. 
    
	Federers ability to conjure victory from thin air was in stark contrast to womens second seed Svetlana Kuznetsovas feeble 3-6, 4-6 capitulation to Polands Agnieszka Radwanska. 
    
	Sixth seed Anna Chakvetadze also lost, beaten 7-6, 1-6, 2-6 by fellow-Russian Maria Kirilenko. Last years mens runner-up Fernando Gonzalez of Chile suffered a 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 1-6 upset loss to Croatian teenager Marin Cilic. The seventh seed simply could not contain the youngest man left in the draw who bombarded him with a barrage of 60 winners. 
    
	Serbian third seed Novak Djokovic cruised into the fourth round with a 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 win over unseeded American Sam Querrey. Compatriot and womens fourth seed Ana Ivanovic secured a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Katerina Srebotnik, needing just one break of serve in each set against the 28th-ranked Slovenian. 
    
	James Blake, seeded 12th, came back from two sets down, then from a double break in the fourth before beating veteran Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean 4-6, 2-6, 6-0, 7-6, 6-2.

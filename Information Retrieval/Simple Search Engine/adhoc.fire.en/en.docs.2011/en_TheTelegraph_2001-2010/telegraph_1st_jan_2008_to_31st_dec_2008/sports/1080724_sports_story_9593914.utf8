            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Mithun Chakraborty at a city hotel on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture      
	Calcutta: Indranath Dey, the Cricket Association of Bengals (CAB) ruling group nominee for one of the vice-presidents posts, runs the risk of coming under the BCCI scanner.         
	Dey is the secretary of Howrah Union club, which on Wednesday signed a five-year contract with actor and Indian Cricket League (ICL) stakeholder Mithun Chakrabortys Royal Bengal Tigers.         
	The BCCIs stated position is that anyone associated with the ICL will be barred from any of its operations.         
	We dont have any information, CAB joint secretary Samar Paul said when asked if the connection can lead to Deys nomination being cancelled.           
	The BCCI hasnt issued any guidelines on this. We will look into the contract and check with Dey too The BCCIs views will also be sought, Paul said.  
	And if they (the BCCI) ask us to cancel his (Deys) nomination we will have to do it, he added.         
	Dey, however, doesnt foresee any problem since the deal is related to a football team. Its absolutely fine. The contract is with a football team and nothing to do with cricket And I am sure this will create no confusion, Dey said.         
	Dey was quoted in a media release as saying, we thank ICL for giving us a bigger platform.         
	Meanwhile, ICL chief executive Himanshu Modi said the league would continue its operations despite all sorts of hurdles created by the BCCI.         
	The BCCI is creating all sorts of hurdles But we will go on Nothing is going to work for them, Modi said.         
	According to the agreement, which will be effective from 2009-10 season, Royal Bengal Tigers would help Howrah Union in setting up the required infrastructure, spotting talent and improving training facilities. An annual deal of Rs 3.6 million was signed, it was learnt.         
	The alliance between my team and Howrah Union is one of its kind It aims to create national sporting icons from Bengal, Mithun said.

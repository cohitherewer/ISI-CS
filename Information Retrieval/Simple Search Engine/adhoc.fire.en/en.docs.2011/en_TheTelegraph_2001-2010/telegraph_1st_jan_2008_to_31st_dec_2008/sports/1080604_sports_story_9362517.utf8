	Paris: Mahesh Bhupathi and Jie Zheng on Tuesday stretched their French Open mixed doubles campaign to the semi-finals after defeating wild card pair of Virginie Razzano and Rogier Wassen in straight sets.         
	The unseeded Indo-Chinese duo beat the French-Dutch combo 6-2, 6-4 in a quarter final encounter, which lasted just 52 minutes.         
	Bhupathi and Zheng raced away with the first set in just 22 minutes after breaking their opponents twice. They converted two of the three break points they earned.         
	Razzano and Wassen did put up a fight in the second set but the winners did not let the momentum slip and converted one of the two break points they earned to seal the set in 30 minutes.         
	Earlier, Bhupathi and his Chinese partner Zheng upset sixth seeds Cara Black of Zimbabwe and Australian Paul Hanley in the second round.         
	The unseeded Indo-Chinese duo defeated Black-Hanley pair 7-6 (7-2), 6-1 in their second round, which lasted over an hour on the clay court.         
	In the mens doubles event, Bhupathi, who had paired up with Bahamas Mark Knowles, and Rohan Bopanna, who had teamed up with Pakistani Aisam Qureshi, had earlier lost in their opening rounds.

                                                   Aussies close to playing in IPL 
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia and Indian Premier League (IPL) organisers have made significant progress in breaking ice on crucial issues, paving the way for Australian players participation in the Twenty20 tournament.         
	According to a report in the Australian newspaper, The Age, the Federation of International Cricketers, which is handling the negotiations, is believed to have struck two crucial compromises.         
	The stipulation in the original contract that the Australians would not be released by the IPL to play for their states or attend national training camps during the tournament has been cleared.         
	 Significant progress has also been made in relation to players obligations to endorse products that may clash with CAs commercial partners. The revised contract would limit the advertising campaigns to the Indian market only, according to the report.         
	According to another report in The Australian, not more than two players may be allowed to play for one franchise in the IPL.         
	The latest developments came as CA vetoed Symondss paid column for a Sunday newspaper in which the allrounder criticised the administrators.

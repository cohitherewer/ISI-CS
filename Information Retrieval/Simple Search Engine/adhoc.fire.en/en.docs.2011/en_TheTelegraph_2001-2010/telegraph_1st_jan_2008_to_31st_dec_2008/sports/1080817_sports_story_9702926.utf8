                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lanka tough to beat, says Yuvi
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: India vice-captain Yuvraj Singh, who played a scintillating knock of 172 on Friday, said facing Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis will not be easy and India will have to do very well to win the upcoming one-dayers against Sri Lanka.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	On the pitch         
	The pitch was a little double-paced, the ball wasnt always coming on. My intention was to spend time in the middle because I havent played for a while. Then I played my strokes.         
	The target he had in his mind         
	I thought the teams target should be around 270. Making 200 on my own wouldnt have been easy, but I am happy with the teams performance.         
	On the bowling attack in the match         
	Murali and Mendis will be different. This was also an international-class attack. The knock gave me a lot of confidence. I have prepared well before coming here, and I hope to continue in this form.         
	How he prepared for this series         
	I prepared keeping in mind the conditions in Sri Lanka, the targets of the team, and its nice that I succeeded immediately in the practice match.         
	The threat from Murali-Mendis         
	Murali and Mendis together make it a top attack. We will have to do very well to defeat Sri Lanka.         
	On the importance of winning the practice match         
	Winning the match is very important because you are the favourite side in this match. So its good that we did that here.         
	Whether missing out in the Tests was a motivation         
	Theres always the motivation to score runs whether you miss out or you dont. You always want to perform at your best. I want to make sure this time when I go to Sri Lanka, Ill better my performances from last time.         
	On his injured back         
	Better now, so hopefully Ill be fully fit before the first match. I didnt have any problems running, after scoring 25-30, the body was getting fatigued, which was nothing unusual for a batsman batting at that position.         
	Hitting six sixes in an over         
	It was playing in my mind, but hitting a bowler for six sixes is very tough.         
	On the conditions in Dambulla         
	Dambulla will be different conditions from here, so we have to have partnerships to make a good score. Its important we play according to the conditions and not peoples expectations. So thats what we will try.         
	On his batting order in the ODI series         
	We never had settled number. The player best suited for the situation goes in. The batting orders good so I am sure we are going to carry on with this.

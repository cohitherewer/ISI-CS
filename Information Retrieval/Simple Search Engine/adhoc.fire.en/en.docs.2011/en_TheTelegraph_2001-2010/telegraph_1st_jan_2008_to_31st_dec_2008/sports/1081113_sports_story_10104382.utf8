The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tevez spares United the blushes vs QPR

	Carlos Tevez scored his first goal for two months to secure Manchester Uniteds passage into the Carling Cup quarter finals, but it required the crucial intervention of teenage substitute Danny Welbeck to prevent Queens Park Rangers from taking Sir Alex Fergusons team into extra-txime at Old Trafford.         
	Despite dominating their Championship opponents throughout, United failed to convert any of their earlier chances before Welbeck, a 72nd-minute replacement for Rodrigo Possebon, won a penalty for the home side after being felled by QPR full-back Peter Ramage.         
	Welbeck, a 17-year-old Mancunian, had been on the pitch for only three minutes prior to his involvement in the penalty incident, but it proved a turning point on a frustrating evening for the Premier League champions, with Tevez capitalising on the opportunity by sending goalkeeper Radek Cerny the wrong way from the spot to claim only his second goal of the season.         
	Since lifting the Carling Cup in 2005, United have endured a miserable time in this competition, particularly against opponents from the Championship.         
	As holders two years ago, United were humbled by Southend United at Roots Hall, and last seasons brief association with the League Cup was ended in humiliating fashion as Coventry City triumphed 2-0 at Old Trafford thanks to two goals from Michael Mifsud.         
	But though Ferguson chose to make eight changes from the team defeated at Arsenal on Saturday, the incoming names still including the likes of Tevez, Nani, John Shea and goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak  all with real-time experience on the more demanding stages of the Premier League and Champions League.         
	There was a distinct feel of second-string about United, however, despite the glittering names among the lesser lights, and it showed as Fergusons team struggled to make headway against the visitors in the first-half. United had to wait until the 15th minute before Cerny was forced into action, and he did well to keep out Tevezs dipping strike from 20 yards.         
	But the Argentinians effort hardly signalled an onslaught by United, and Cerny only had to remain alert for sporadic forays into his penalty area by the European champions. Aside from a couple of near misses from Anderson and Tevez, the former Spurs goalkeeper had little to worry about before half-time.         
	With the untried Angolan Manucho the only forward on the substitutes bench, Ferguson had few options to consider at half-time as he attempted to increase his teams attacking threat, and the second-half began in a similar fashion to the first  United dominating possession but doing nothing with it.         
	Park Ji-Sung sparked United into life on 57 minutes, though, when he struck the far post from inside the penalty area after being teed up by Brazilian full-back Rafael da Silva. Cerny was beaten, but the woodwork kept his goal intact, yet the goalkeeper did produce a crucial save four minutes later when he tipped another Tevez strike over the bar.         
	Having spent virtually the whole game camped inside their own half, QPR finally realised the need to test Kuszczak in the United goal and the Polish goalkeeper endured a nervous final ten minutes as Gareth Ainsworths team aimed a series of crosses into the penalty area.         
	But the gaps created at the back left QPR vulnerable to conceding a second goal and Cerny was forced into another fine save to deny Nani in stoppage time.

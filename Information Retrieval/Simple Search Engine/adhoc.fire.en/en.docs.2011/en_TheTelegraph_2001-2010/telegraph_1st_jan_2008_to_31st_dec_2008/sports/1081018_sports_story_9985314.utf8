The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | What Ive achieved today is Indias achievement: Sachin
                                                                                                                                                                                                       HIGH AND MIGHTY
    What Ive achieved today is Indias achievement: Sachin
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar takes the run to become the worlds highest run-getter in Tests in Mohali on Friday. (AP)                           
	Chandigarh: It was a shade under 19 years ago that a curly-haired and reticent teenager made his maiden Test appearance, at the National Stadium in Karachi.         
	Women in the zenana stands teased him as India ka bachcha and the Javed Miandads felt they had an easy prey. By the end of that tour, though, Sachin Tendulkar was no more a bachcha.         
	On Friday afternoon, after what he described as a fantastic journey, Sachin became the highest run-getter in Tests. Having made an awesome statement over the 22 yards in neighbouring Mohali, it was time to make a few points off the field.         
	That the stones thrown along the way had actually been converted into milestones.         
	He didnt have to prove anything to anybody and, as important, just didnt have to answer critics. Didnt have to lose sleep over opinions too.         
	That while he wasnt looking as far ahead as the 2011 World Cup, to be co-hosted by India, he was enjoying his innings and didnt intend doing a Sourav Ganguly any time soon.         
	Sachins 35.         
	There was absolutely no need for anybody to offer unsolicited advice on when to call it a day. Nobody told me then (when he started playing) and nobody should tell me now either.         
	That...                   
	Clearly, Sachin made a huge statement off the field as well and the reverberations will be felt for some time to come. All because of the exalted position he enjoys.         
	The first to 10,000 runs in ODIs and the first to 12,000 in Tests... Add 39 Test hundreds and 42 in ODIs and, well, you have a CV which would make anybody envious.         
	Im happy that people have liked the things Ive done... I dont think I need to change... What Ive achieved today is Indias achievement, Sachin told The Telegraph soon after returning to a typically Punjabi (naach-gaana) reception at the Taj.         
	Sachin hadnt received a congratulatory message from Brian Lara, at least not till late in the evening (I guess hes travelling in Australia), but there had been a missed call from the talismanic West Indian the other day.         
	Records are destined to be re-written and Sachin accepted that with humility which is such a characteristic of his.         
	This record is a reflection of my contribution to Indian cricket for 19 years... Success is a process... I didnt set targets when I was a 16-year-old (on India debut)... Maybe, another 16-year-old will come along, not set targets, and who knows where he may go... All records are meant to be broken, is how Sachin put it so beautifully.         
	Asked if taking time to get past Laras 11,953 had become a burden, Sachin replied: It wasnt... I wasnt really under so much pressure, but people would ask only one thing. However, he confessed he hadnt slept well going into the Test.         
	Fifteen short of emerging the numero uno, Sachin finished with a superb 88 and didnt deviate from the script, which is all his own, once he got past Lara.         
	He looked towards heaven, thanking the almighty for everything and remembered his father, Ramesh, whod passed away during the 1999 World Cup.         
	That the PCA Stadium had been far from full didnt hurt Sachin (its not a regret) and he dedicated his latest record to his family, particularly mother Rajni.         
	Every Australian, by the way, wished Sachin as soon as the record was his, moments into the opening days post-tea session. He is, after all, respected as the modern day Bradman.         
	Sachin chose his maiden Test hundred (119 not out at Old Trafford in 1990) and the two three-figure knocks in his first Test series in Australia  148 not out in Sydney and 114 in Perth  in 1991-92, as his most special hundreds.         
	Footnote: As Friday was Anil Kumbles birthday, two cakes were cut in the Team India dressing room. Back at the hotel, the celebrations began with two bottles of champagne.

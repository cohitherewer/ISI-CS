	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan captain Bhaichung Bhutia appears uncertain for their tough Round XIV encounter against Churchill Brothers in the I-League at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. 
    
	Having sustained an ankle injury, Bhaichung missed practice on Wednesday. But club officials expressed hope that he would turns up against the Goans. The city giants, placed fourth in the table with 21 points, have more woes in store with Dharmajit Singh (ankle), Venkatesh (groin), James Singh (fever) ruled out of the crucial match through injuries. 
    
	In their absence, Mohun Bagan will bank on their Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto. 
    
	The match is also seen as a battle between the two foreigners  Odafe Okolie versus Barreto. While Odafe (17 goals) is the leading scorer this season, Barreto has not done badly either with four goals to his credit. 
    
	But Barreto ruled out any personal battle saying its a team game. 
    
	Conceding that it would be a tough match, Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira said: They are a very good side with Odafe is in very good form. It will be tough if we fail to stop Odafe.

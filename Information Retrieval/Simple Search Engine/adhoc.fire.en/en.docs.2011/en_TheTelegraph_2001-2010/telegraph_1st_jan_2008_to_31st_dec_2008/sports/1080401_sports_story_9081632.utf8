The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reward for Pakistan cricketers
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Reward for Pakistan cricketers  
	Karachi: The Pakistan cricket authorities have increased the financial rewards for the players in the new central contracts by linking good performances with special bonuses.  
	Under the new central contract, if a senior player like Mohammed Yousuf plays in an ODI against India or any of the top three teams in the ICC rankings, scores a century and his team wins, his total take-home from the game will be in the range of Rs 1 million.         
	This is apart from the monthly retainer of Rs 300,000 that Yousuf gets from his central contract.         
	Even a catch and run out in a match can now earn a player the bonus amount of Rs 100,000 and it only increases with more catches and run-outs. The board has even kept a bonus amount of 200 per cent of match fees if the team wins a Test or one-day series against the top three ICC teams and India.         
	Shoaib hearing         
	Karachi: Temperamental fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar could face a penalty between Rs 1 to 5 million and even a ban of up to seven matches if the disciplinary committee of the PCB finds him guilty of violating the players code of conduct.         
	Shoaib and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria are due to appear before the disciplinary committee Tuesday to respond to the charges of speaking out against the policies of the board and other violations of the code.         
	Selectors ire         
	Karachi: Pakistans national selectors are unhappy with captain Shoaib Malik for his absence during the selection of the squad for the Bangladesh series. The selectors were surprised when they were told to communicate with Malik, who was not available for the last 10 days citing his mothers poor health, on telephone in Mumbai to finalise the squad for the first two one-day games against Bangladesh.         
	Younis plea         
	 Karachi: Younis Khan urged the PCB to find a middle path to resolve the issues arising out of the players joining the rebel ICL, saying banning them was not a proper solution. I feel sad. I just think that banning these players is not the solution to the ICL. The board needs to find a middle path to safeguard the interest of Pakistan cricket, Younis said.         
	Former skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, Abdul Razzaq, Imran Farhat, Mohammed Sami, Taufeeq Umar have aligned with the ICL and are no longer available to play even in domestic competitions. Younis opined that absence of these players from the domestic cricket map was a loss to Pakistani cricket.         
	Heroes win         
	 Calcutta: Former Pakistan allrounder Abdul Razzaq hit an unbeaten 78 and took three wickets to lead Hyderabad Heroes to a seven-run victory over Mumbai Champs in the Edelweiss 20s Challenge at Lal Bahadur Stadium, Hyderabad on Monday.         
	BRIEF SCORES         
	Hyderabad Heroes 176/2 (Abdul Razzaq 78, Ambati Rayudu 55). Mumbai Champs 169/9 (Raviraj Patil 51, Robin Morris 56, Razzaq 3/31). Hyderabad Heroes win by seven runs.

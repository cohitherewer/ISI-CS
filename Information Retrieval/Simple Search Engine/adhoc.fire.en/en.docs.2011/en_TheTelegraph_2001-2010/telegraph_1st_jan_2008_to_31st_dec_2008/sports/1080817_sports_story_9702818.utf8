            MADHUMITA GANGULY            Vijender Kumar of India during his bout against Angkhan Chomphuphuang of Thailand in Beijing on Saturday. (AFP)                           
	Beijing: After shooting it is time now for the boxers to raise visions of more medals.         
	A day after Akhil Kumar decimated world champion Sergey Vodopyanov to move into the 54kg quarters, his cousin, Jitender Kumar, scripted a sensational victory on Saturday over Uzbekistans Tulashboy Doniyorov to enter the last eight of the 51kg flyweight competition as well.         
	Late in the evening, Vijender became the third from the country to reach the quarter finals. The Haryana boxer thoroughly dominated his bout to tame Angkhan Chomphuphuang of Thailand 13-3 in the pre quarters of the 75kg category event. He will meet Carlos Gongora of Ecuador in the next round. All three are just a win away from a medal.         
	Jitender, the 21-year-old flyweight boxer from Haryana, overwhelmed Doniyorov 13-6 in the four-round encounter. Jitender, who led in all four rounds, meets three-time European champion Russian Georgy Balakshin on Tuesday and gets a chance to avenge his defeat in the 2007 world championship by just one point.         
	The last time we met it was too close to call and Balakshin managed to sneak past riding on his luck. But this time I am better prepared, Jitender said. This time I wont spare him, main use nahin chooronga, yeh mera vaada raha! Akhil has beaten him in the past and Ill ask for Akhils advice, he added.         
	In winning the bout, Jitender essentially won a tactical battle.         
	In fact, through the four rounds Tulashboy managed to land just four punches on Jitender  his other two points came from penalty, compared to 11 blows that Jitender successfully landed on the Uzbek.         
	Bubbling and full of energy, the pugilist said that he and his fellow-boxers were all so excited that they didnt even sleep the previous night as mentor Akhil was readying him for Saturdays bout.         
	Vijender began cautiously and took a 2-0 lead at the end of the first round which he stretched to 6-1 after the second round and 10-1 after the third. Though the Thai tried a comeback in the last round, Vijender kept his superiority intact to ensure a facile win.         
	On Friday, Akhil too put took himself within touching distance of a medal. The Haryana boxer, trailing 2-6 at one stage, drew parity in the dying seconds and won on points to reach the quarter final         
	The Russian had a slight edge in both the rounds as he raced to a 6-2 lead midway through the third round.         
	Akhil eventually managed to reduce the gap in the third (7-8) and then in the final drew parity at 9-9.         
	With both levelled at 9-9, the Indian was declared the winner on points.         
	Im here only to win the gold, said Akhil after winning his bout.

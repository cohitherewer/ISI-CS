The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 4th ODI Highlights
                                                                                                                                                                                                     4th ODI Highlights
                      
	This was Indias first ever bilateral ODI series win in Sri Lanka. Their previous series encounters being: 1985-86 (SL 1, Ind 1, Nr 1); 1993-94 (SL 2, Ind 1); 1997-98 (SL 3, Ind 0, Nr 1)         
	 Virat Kohli became the fourth Indian teenager to register a half-century in ODIs. The others being Sachin Tendulkar; Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina.         
	 The 143-run stand between Suresh Raina and Mahendra Singh Dhoni just failed to better Indias best against Sri Lanka for the fourth wicket, the unbeaten 145 between Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh in Vizag in February 2007. However, the pair managed to go past the previous best for India in Sri Lanka against the hosts, which was the 117 between Rahul Dravid and Mohammed Ahzaruddin also at this ground in July 1997.         
	 Thilan Thushara (5/47) was the best bowling figure by a Sri Lankan bowler against India at home. He bettered the previous best of 4/18 by Sanath Jayasuriya at Colombo, SSC, in July 1998. Incidentally, this was the only 10th five-plus wicket haul for Sri Lanka at home.         
	 Thushara (40 amp; 5/47) became only the second Sri Lankan after Sanath Jayasuriya to score over 30 runs and claim five wickets in the same match. Jayasuriya (44 amp; 5/48) had achieved this feat against West Indies in Port of Spain in 1997.           COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

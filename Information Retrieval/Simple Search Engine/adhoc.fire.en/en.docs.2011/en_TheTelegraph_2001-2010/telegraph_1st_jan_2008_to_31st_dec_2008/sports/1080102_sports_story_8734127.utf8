                                                    Weve got to start all over again, says Ricky Ponting

	Sydney: As part of their pre-match commitments, rival captains Ricky Ponting and Anil Kumble spoke to the media on Tuesday afternoon. Both also had a brief one-on-one with The Telegraph, at the SCG (which hosts the second Test) itself. 
       
	The following are excerpts from what Ponting said 
    
	On having gone 1-0 up after a one-sided Test 
    
	Look, we had a great win at the MCG last week, but its only one Test down out of four and all of us know that this game can change pretty quickly... What we did last week was terrific, but weve got to start all over again tomorrow. Of course, weve got some momentum from the last game and need to take it forward... We cant sit back and wait for things to happen for we know Indias a good enough side to get the momentum going in their favour... Its about how we start... 
    
	On the Indians having done well at the SCG on the last tour (2003-04) 
    
	Yes, they did very well and when you come to overseas grounds where youve done well, then you do get a good feeling. That the Indians scored over 700 in the first innings proved theyd done a lot of things right. I think were better equipped this time to make sure that doesnt happen again. Weve got plans in place and its a question of executing them. 
    
	On the huge emotional flavour in that Test, which was Steve Waughs last 
    
	Wasnt a distraction because Steve had announced his retirement at the start of that summer. It was indeed a great Test match to be a part of. 
    
	On the Indians lack of preparation going into the first Test 
    
	Way too much has been made of it, for theyd just had a three-Test series against Pakistan... Its not that they hadnt been playing for months and Im not sure how much of a difference it would have made had the tour-opener not been affected by rain. In fact, the wicket at the MCG had been pretty similar to what theyd been playing on at home. The skills, in my view, dont go anywhere... Different things work for different people, but too much got made about the lack of preparation. 
    
	On whether he expects changes in the Indian team 
    
	(Grins) A couple of changes wouldnt surprise me... I thought about it long and hard yesterday... I wouldnt be surprised if they brought in (Virender) Sehwag and left out (Wasim) Jaffer to try and take some of the scoring pressure off Dravid. 
    
	[By the evening, however, it was clear that Sehwag would have to wait for his turn in this four-Test series.] 
    
	On Sachin Tendulkar 
    
	He looked nice and positive at the MCG, but I think Brett (Lee) has, of late, been bowling at him very well... Sachins usually very good at summing up the wickets condition. 
    
	On having discouraged talk about being one Test away from equalling their own record of 16 consecutive wins (between 1999-2001) 
    
	Nothing wrong with it, but it can take your focus away... I dont mind a bit of talk about it, but you need a clear mind to think of every ball youll be bowling or facing... Were getting close to a great milestone and thats exciting, but youve got to win 600 contests before you win a days play and youve got to put together five days before you win a Test... The lesser you think (about 16 wins) the better and Id like the guys to get it out of their system before tomorrow ... I dont sit back and think of such things... For me, its more about a day to day work ethic. 
    
	On the SCG wicket 
    
	Had a look at it first thing in the morning... Looked particularly good, had a bit of grass... I think its going to be a good Test wicket. 
    
	On his team 
    
	Its the start of a new year and the spirit around the group is good... Well be playing the XI which won so comprehensively at the MCG... (Adds laughing) At different times, everybody except me played a part in that win... We either had a fair partnership or bowled with discipline. Our intensity, especially while fielding, was very good... You wont see laziness or complacency... Havent sensed that the guys will be waiting for things to happen... Clearly, well have to execute our plans well. 
    
	On the excellent show by his bowlers at the MCG 
    
	The Indian batsmen definitely have concerns because of how well we bowled there... Our attack is balanced... A lot has been made about the Indian batting, but our bowlers didnt give them many scoring opportunities... Im sure Rahul Dravid (who took 41 balls to get off the mark in the first innings) was trying to score off every ball he faced... We set some pretty high standards last week and want to live up to them. 
    
	On bowling coach Troy Cooleys contribution 
    
	The boys have worked very hard with him and vice-versa... Troy has had Mitchell (Johnson) under him for a couple of years and, when we were batting at the MCG, they were working together on the seam and wrist positions... Hes helping find new ways for the bowlers to improve and, hopefully, theyll develop more skills. 
    
	On Brad Hogg having been among the wickets at the MCG 
    
	It must have given him more confidence... A couple of the flippers he bowled were as good as anyone... The execution of his plans was very good. Hell probably be a better bowler at the SCG. 
    
	On having a fine record at the SCG 
    
	Yes, Ive got five Test hundreds, so there are a lot of good feelings about being here... Hopefully, Ill be feeling good throughout this week... It will be nice to get some runs and spend some time in the middle. 
    
	On Harbhajan Singh having got him quite a few times 
    
	(Grins) He got me out on his first ball at the MCG (second innings) and, so, Ive got some improving to do... Harbhajan does have a great record against me, but Im training hard and batting well... I hope to get him away at the SCG. 
    
	On this period of transition, life without Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath 
    
	So far, touch wood, this transition phase has been very good... A lot was made at the end of last summer about how we would re-group and so on after the loss of some great players, but I had faith in the guys coming in. There will be ups and downs, as it is with all teams, but well be looking to improve on our performances. 
    
	On how he ushered in 2008 
    
	I was at home and didnt really think about what I wanted to achieve in the new year. 
    
	On touring Pakistan from March 
    
	The tour is still some months away and well be guided by the experts on the ground in Pakistan and on the ground in Australia... Watching the events of last week on the TV did create some concerns... We havent played Pakistan too much in recent years and Id much rather be playing than not playing cricket. 
    
	Finally, on having ended 2007 with a 100 per cent success record as captain 
    
	(Smiles) Its a nice piece of statistics, but youve got to remember its the players who produce victories... Im just the captain... The effort comes from all XI... The credit, therefore, is the teams and not mine.

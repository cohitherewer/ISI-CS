  - Overnight leader Shamim Khan, Chowrasia miss the cut       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jyoti Randhawa in Gurgaon on Friday                                 
	Gurgaon: Indian pro Shiv Kapur fired a sparkling seven-under-par 65 in the second round to emerge joint leader in the $2.5 million Johnnie Walker Classic on Friday.         
	The 25-year-old Kapur, who had been down with a viral infection for the past few days, ended the day at top of the table with Australias Unho Park at 10-under 134.         
	Leading Indian golfers once again had a field day at the sun-kissed DLF Golf and Country Club.         
	While Kapur posted a blemish-free round that included one eagle and five birdies, Jyoti Randhawa also slammed a seven-under-par 65 to stay at third place with Japans Taichiro Kiyota.         
	Jeev Milkha Singh (70) managed to salvage a round that seemed to be slipping away with two birdies on the last two holes to be six-under 138 in tied 13th place, while Rahil Gangjee (71) blew a brilliant start of four-under through eight holes to be five-under 139 at shared 19th place along with Arjun Singh (70).         
	Indian Masters champion S.S.P. Chowrasia and overnight leader Shamim Khan missed the cut. Chowrasia had one-over 73 on Day II after Thursdays even par 72.         
	World No. 5 Adam Scott of Australia stayed within striking reach after grinding out a second successive 68 to share the fifth place. Fijian star Vijai Singh is tied 13th at six-under 138.         
	Kapur was a bit amused after finding himself on the top of the leaderboard. I am obviously pretty happy, he said. If somebody told me at the start of the week that I would be leading after two rounds, I would have laughed.         
	Im like an injured soldier, he said. Yes, I can talk, I can breathe. But I got up this morning with a sore back. Like I said yesterday, sometimes its better when youre sick, because then youre not thinking so much about technique.         
	Playing on his home course, Randhawa said: Its been a great round. I just tried to play the game. I just wanted to go out there and have fun and do the best that I could with my game. That helped.         
	Jeev Milkha Singh, started the second day aggressively to take the lead after seven holes at seven-under. But he bogeyed in the 17th hole again to climb down at six-under. It was his first bogey of the day.         
	I need to play the 17th more carefully, I bogeyed it yesterday also. I played it conservatively today but the ball kept on rolling and fell in the water, said Jeev.

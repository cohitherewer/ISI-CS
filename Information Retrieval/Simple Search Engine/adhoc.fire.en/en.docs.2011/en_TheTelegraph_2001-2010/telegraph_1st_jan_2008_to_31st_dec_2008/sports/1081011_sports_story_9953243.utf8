	London/Buenos Aires: Only two months into the European football season and Italy, Portugal and The Netherlands are already limping into World Cup qualifying games, leaving behind long lists of injured stars for the two rounds of games on Saturday and next Wednesday.         
	Defending champions Italy go to Bulgaria with half their regular starting line-up sidelined while Germany are struggling to find a fit and experienced goalkeeper for their Saturday home tie against Russia after Robert Enke broke his hand in training.         
	Portugal, despite welcoming back Cristiano Ronaldo, have Ricardo Carvalho, Deco, Maniche and Simao Sabrosa among their absentees as they try to climb from an embarrassing fourth place in their group when they face Sweden away.         
	The Netherlands have six outfield players and a goalkeeper sidelined and have persuaded Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar to come out of retirement.         
	Paraguay can extend their lead with a win at Colombia while Brazil and Argentina can ill afford to lose more points in this weekends round of the South American World Cup qualifiers. Paraguay lead with 17 points after eight games and travel to Bogota. Argentina host Uruguay in Buenos Aires. Venezuela welcome a resurgent Brazil on Sunday.

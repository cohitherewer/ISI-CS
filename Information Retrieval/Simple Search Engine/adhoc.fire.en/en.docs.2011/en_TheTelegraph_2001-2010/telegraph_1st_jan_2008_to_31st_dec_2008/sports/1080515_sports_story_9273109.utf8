The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Akram hails Buchanan
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Akram hails Buchanan
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram on Wednesday said Kolkata Knight Riders coach John Buchanan had shown that maverick spesedster Shoaib Akhtar needed to be handled more firmly and professionally to get the best results out of him.         
	Shoaib was not played in two matches by Buchanan, who was not satisfied with the bowlers overall fitness, but when the bowler got a chance on Tuesday, he claimed four wickets to set up a win for his team in a low-scoring game.         
	Akram also said he was vindicated in saying that Shoaibs performance was boosted by big crowds.         
	I had said Shoaib has the ability to perform in the IPL. He is the type of cricketer who is boosted by big crowds and centre stage. But the way Buchanan handled him also shows that he needs to be handled more firmly and professionally to get the best out of him, Akram said.         
	Former captain Rashid Latif said that for a bowler with the pace and experience of Shoaib, Twenty20 cricket was the ideal brand of competition and he could become a big draw and performer in such professional leagues.         
	I am happy for him because he has gone through a bad time in recent months and he needed a break, Latif said.         
	Meanwhile, Akram will hold a specialised training camp for aspiring pacers across Pakistan. He will also try to groom the young pace talents and scout out new faces for as part of the PCBs programme to invest in the budding players in the country.         
	Akram had uncovered the talented Sohail Tanvir. Akram said Tanvir had shown glimpses of his talent even in the camp and would be a good performer for the country as he improves and gains experience.         
	He certainly has the required potential and pace to do well. (PTI)

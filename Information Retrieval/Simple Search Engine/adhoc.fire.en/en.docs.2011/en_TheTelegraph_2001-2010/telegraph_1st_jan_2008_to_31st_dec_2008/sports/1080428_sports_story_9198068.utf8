The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I was quite competitive: Fisichella
                                                                                                                                                                                           I was quite competitive: Fisichella
                      
	Barcelona: Giancarlo Fisichella came close to scoring his first point in a Force India car before settling for a seasons best 10th place even though teammate Adrian Sutil had yet another did not finish tag against his name in the incident-strewn Spanish Grand Prix here Sunday.         
	On a day when only 13 drivers could bring home their cars, Fisichella cut through the cluttered traffic to rise to eighth position, pushing for Force Indias first point of the season after 43 laps before Nick Heidfeld managed to pip the Italian.         
	Though a point eluded him, Fisichella, starting 19th on the grid, made up nine places  more than any other driver  registering his best finish of the season in the process.         
	Sutils car was lifted off the track by a crane and the German youngster finished with his third DNF of the season.         
	I know several cars had accidents but I did my best. I was comfortable and I think I was quite competitive. I enjoyed the battle with Heidfeld, he was quicker than me but I managed to keep him behind for many laps, said the Italian.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ACC awards on July 5
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ACC awards on July 5
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Puri: Four years after the International Cricket Council introduced annual awards, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) has decided to present eight awards to mark the silver jubilee of its existence.         
	The awards will be presented in Karachi on July 5, on the eve of the Asia Cup final.         
	Whats confirmed is that the awards are being presented that day... Right now, though, I cant say whether they will become a regular feature, the ACCs chief executive, Syed Ashraful Huq, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Kuala Lumpur, where the ACC is headquartered, on Wednesday afternoon, Huq added: There will be two Lifetime Achievement awards, one each for a cricketer and an administrator... The other awards will be for the year 2007  Best Test Batsman and Bowler, Best ODI Batsman and Bowler, Woman Cricketer of the Year and the Umpire of the Year.         
	According to Huq, the chief executives (or those holding an equivalent position) of the four Test-playing nations in Asia are on the selection panel, which is chaired by ACC vice-president Khwaja Imran of Singapore.         
	While Niranjan Shah is Indias representative, Duleep Mendis (Sri Lanka), Shafqat Nagmi (Pakistan) and Nizamuddin Choudhury (Bangladesh) are the other selectors.         
	Theres speculation that while Pakistans legendary Hanif Mohammed could get the Lifetime Achievement award in the cricketers category, the ACCs first president, Indias N.K.P. Salve, could be honoured with the Lifetime Achievement award for administrators.         
	Salve and Pakistans Air Marshal (retd) Nur Khan had taken the lead in forming the ACC, not many months after Salve had been denied a couple of complimentaries/tickets for the history-creating 1983 World Cup final at Lords.         
	Those complimentaries/tickets, apparently, were needed for Salves colleagues in the Union cabinet, whod decided to take the first flight for London once Kapil Devs team made the final.         
	Salve was then the Board of Control for Cricket in India president.         
	Meanwhile, all former presidents and secretaries as also those who attended the inaugural meeting of the ACC, on September 19-20, 1983, have been invited for the July 5 function.         
	Bangladeshs Huq, incidentally, was one of those who attended that meeting in New Delhi.

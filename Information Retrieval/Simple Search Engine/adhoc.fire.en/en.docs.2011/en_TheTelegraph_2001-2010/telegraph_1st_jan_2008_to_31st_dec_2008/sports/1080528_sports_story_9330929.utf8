The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | One of the best wins of my career: Warne
                                                                                                                                                                                                       One of the best wins of my career: Warne
  - Its all about self belief in close matches, says Rajasthan captain after victory over Mumbai             Shane Warne                           
	Jaipur: Rajasthan Royals captain and coach Shane Warne has described the last-ball win against Mumbai Indians on Monday as one of the best victories in his 20-year career.         
	Warne also lavished praise on youngsters Niraj Patel (40 not out) and Ravindra Jadeja (23 not out) for keeping their cool and clinching an improbable five-wicket win in the last over.         
	It was a sensational win and I would rate it as one of the best games of my 20-year-long cricketing career, Warne said after the match at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium on Monday night.         
	In such close matches, its all about self belief About how you handle the pressure and keep your cool. I am proud of the manner in which Jadeja and Neeraj handled the pressure.         
	Jadejas six over cover was unbelievable. It speaks volumes about the talent this young man possesses. Neeraj too has shown again that he can be more than handful in such situations, he said.         
	On why seasoned pros among the Mumbai Indians ranks failed to handle the pressure while rookies like Jadeja and Patel were able to pull off the sensational win, Warne said: We give confidence to youngsters.         
	One of our team slogans is find the way and also play your role. I am proud that my team has done so.         
	And dont forget Sohail Tanvirs fine effort. It is difficult to squeeze in everybody. It will be tough for us during the selections whom to leave out.         
	On his role as captain and coach, Warne reiterated his stance.         
	I believe coaches are needed only in the developmental phase. They are not required at international level. And I believe IPL is international cricket, said the retired Australian leg-spinner, who had never been at ease with former Australia coach John Buchanan.         
	Warne took a dig at the Mumbai Indians coach Lal Chand Rajputs comment that luck was not on Mumbai side.         
	If an international bowler like (Dilhara) Fernando bowls a wide under pressure in last over then is it unlucky? It has nothing to do with luck.         
	You should have the capacity to deliver under pressure. He took too much time to bowl his last over. He might have lost his rhythm, he said.         
	Warne said he did not find scheduling of the IPL up to the mark.         
	Teams qualifying for semi-finals after retaining top two slots should be given some advantage. Or what use is it to qualify for the semi-finals remaining at top if one has to play away from home.         
	Playing in your backyard is a huge advantage. Support of thousands of spectators is very important, said Warne. The Rajasthan Royals have not lost a single match on home turf.         
	If somehow Mumbai sneak in to the last four they will have this advantage whereas others will miss it.         
	The IPL will have to rectify this next year. We all are learning in first edition of IPL. The franchises, players and the administrators too should improve upon next year, the legendary leg-spinner said.           (PTI)

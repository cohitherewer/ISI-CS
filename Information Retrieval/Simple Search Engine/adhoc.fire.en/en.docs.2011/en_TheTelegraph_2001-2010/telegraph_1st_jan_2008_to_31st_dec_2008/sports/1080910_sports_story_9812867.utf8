The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mohun Bagan sniff league title
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mohun Bagan sniff league title
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Barreto      
	Calcutta: Preparations were in place and thousands of fans were seen celebrating after Mohun Bagans win over Camellia George Telegraph at home on Tuesday on the assumption that their club had clinched the CFL Premier Division title for the 28th time.         
	After the match, though Bagan remained at the top of the table with 30 points, they still have to wait for the result of the Mohammedan Sporting-Calcutta Port Trust tie on Wednesday before they can lay their hands on the trophy.         
	A draw or a loss for Mohammedan Sporting would ensure Bagan the title on Wednesday. But if the black and white brigade manage a win, then Bagan would need to win the Friday derby against East Bengal. They will then notch up 33 points and ensure the championship.         
	But if Bagan lose to East Bengal then they would have to wait till Saturday when Mohammedan Sporting lock horns with United SC.         
	If Shabbir Alis men manage to win both their remaining matches, then the goal difference will come into play.         
	In that case, Bagan, who are enjoying a better goal difference of +13, hold the edge over Mohammedan Sporting (a + 7 goal difference).         
	Mohammedan Sporting are currently at second spot with 24 points from 12 matches while East Bengal are on equal points from 13 outings.         
	According to Bagans Moroccan coach Karim Bencharifa: I know Bagan are mathematically the league champions but it is still not over.         
	Shabbir, however, thought it would be a tough job for his boys.         
	I think our chances are remote. But we are not thinking of the title. We are focussed on winning our last two matches and that will help us keep the momentum going, he told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening.         
	Asked what he thought was the point at which Mohammedan Sporting fell behind in the title race, Shabbir identified the return-leg match against Bagan, which had ended 1-1.         
	We were out of the race after that match. The points were shared and we fell way behind our target, Shabbir said.         
	But I am happy with my boys. They have played like champions, he said.

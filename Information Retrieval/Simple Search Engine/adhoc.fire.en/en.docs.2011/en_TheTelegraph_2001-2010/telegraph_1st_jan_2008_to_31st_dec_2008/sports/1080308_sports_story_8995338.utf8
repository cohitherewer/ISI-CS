The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crunch tie for India 
                                                   Crunch tie for India 
                      
	Santiago: It will be a do-or-die situation for India as they take on hosts Chile in their last league match on Saturday with an eye on the final hockey qualifying berth for the Beijing Olympics.         
	India may be just two matches away from qualifying, but it is easier said than done as they first need to defeat Chile and then face Britain, who beat them by 3-2 margin on Thursday.         
	India have never missed an Olympics since their debut in 1928 and the consequences of failure to do so are too damning to even visualise. A defeat to Chile will almost certainly knock them out of contention.         
	Thus, at the moment, the onus is on India to perform and win both their remaining matches.         
	The Indians are virtually assured of a place in the final where they will take on Britain. India are on nine points, the same as Austria, but with a healthy and almost unassailable goal-difference.         
	Austria need to beat Britain on Saturday and then hope for Chile to do the same against India. Should Austria lose to great Britain, as is expected, then, it will pitchfork India into the final while rendering their match against Chile inconsequential.         
	In the event of a surprise Austrian victory, India will have to beat Chile to qualify for the final on superior goal-difference.         
	Indias advantage is that they would be playing last and so will have a clear picture as to what is required of them.         
	Indias chief coach Joaquim Carvalho believes that India will be playing Britain on Sunday.           (PTI)

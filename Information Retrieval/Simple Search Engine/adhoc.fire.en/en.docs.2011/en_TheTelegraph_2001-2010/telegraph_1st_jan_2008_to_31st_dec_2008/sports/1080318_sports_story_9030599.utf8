The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I can still deliver for England: Becks 
                                                   I can still deliver for England: Becks 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                  DAVID BECKHAM      
	After taking a Beckham-sized salary to decamp to Los Angeles to recreate the glories of The Great Gatsby and Tender is the Night for Hollywood, F. Scott Fitzgerald remarked sadly that there are no second acts in American lives.         
	They said much the same when David Beckham arrived in Los Angeles from Madrid. There could be no place in the international game for a man who would not kick a ball from November to March and whose principal opponents would make Derby resemble Barcelona. Yet, had Beckham started that rain-sodden night at Wembley against Croatia, England might not be contemplating an empty summer.         
	As he delivered a wonderful cross-field pass some 40 yards to the US captain, Landon Donovan, you wondered if Fabio Capellos assistant, Franco Baldini, who flew 9,500 miles to take in LA Galaxys friendly with FC Dallas, will reach the same conclusion.         
	I have always said that I want to be part of England. I dont want to let go of that, Beckham said. I still want to play for my country and nothing is going to change that even if I am on another side of the world. It wont change the passion. My game will not change just because the standards are different.

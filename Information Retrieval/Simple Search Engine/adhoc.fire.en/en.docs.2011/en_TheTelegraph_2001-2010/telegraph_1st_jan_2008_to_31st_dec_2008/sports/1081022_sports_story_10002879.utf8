            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: India pacer Zaheer Khan was fined 80 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the ICC code of conduct during the second Test against Australia.         
	The fast bowler pleaded guilty, after being summoned by match referee Chris Broad, for a level two charge under the code of conduct.         
	The Indian pacer appeared to have said something aggressively to Australian opener Mathew Hayden after the latters dismissal on Monday.         
	Respect for the opposition was something that we talked about in the pre-series meeting I had with both captains and so it was disappointing that Zaheer behaved in this way. However, in considering the penalty, I took into account the fact that Zaheer had a good disciplinary record, match referee Chris Broad said in a statement.         
	The umpires had laid the charge against Zaheer.         
	Captain Ricky Ponting hinted at the Indians having crossed the line with the banter during the second Test.         
	The umpires have got involved a couple of instances in this game. The match referee got involved in the Zaheer case yesterday (Monday). What more you can say, he said. Its for the referee and the umpires to make out what they want. As a player I havent been too concerned about a little chit chat on the ground.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who captained the side in the second Test here, also said that a bit of verbal chit chat boosts the excitement in the game.

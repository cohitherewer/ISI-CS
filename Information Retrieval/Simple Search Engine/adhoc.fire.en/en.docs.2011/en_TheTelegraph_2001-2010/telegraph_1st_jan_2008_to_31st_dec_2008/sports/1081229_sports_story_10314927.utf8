The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shorter run-up helped: Zaheer
                                                                                                                                                                                           Shorter run-up helped: Zaheer
                      
	New Delhi: Indias pace spearhead Zaheer Khan has credited his return to form after months in the wilderness to a shortened run-up, which he says has helped him become fitter and consistent.         
	I think a major difference in my career has been made by my readiness to cut down on my run-up. My reduced run-up, without sacrificing on my leap at the point of delivery, has both improved my rhythm and fitness, Zaheer said.         
	Zaheer has had his opponents numb with clever bouncers and a particularly dangerous one that straightens after pitching.         
	With successive averages of 37.40, 44.00 and 43.18 in his last three series prior to the recent one against England, Zaheer has clearly enhanced his reputation.         
	Comparisons are already being made to legendary Wasim Akram of Pakistan in his prime.         
	Its a great compliment to be compared to Akram really, though I sincerely believe bowlers like him appear once in a generation. He had great accuracy and bowled with a rare venom, said Zaheer, who is now only three wickets away from entering the 200-club in Test cricket.         
	Zaheer said that improved fitness and bowling style did not just happen, and that a great deal of planning and went behind his new resourcefulness.         
	Fitness was an issue with me for most of my career. I realised that it improved when I bowled a lot, he said.         
	The 30-year-old bowler said his stint with Worcestershire last year was the catalyst that turned things around for him.         
	Bowling six days a week and that too as a professional made me a better and fitter cricketer, he said.         
	Like a typical pacer, Zaheer also likes to return fire with fire and he seems to reserve special hostility for the Australians, particularly Matthew Hayden, which occasionally has him at the receiving end of the Match Referees stick.         
	During the creditable 320-run win over Australia in Mohali in October, Zaheer was fined 80 per cent of his match fee for running towards a departing Hayden, circling him and mouthing a few words which did not go down well with Match Referee Chris Broad.           (PTI)

	Ahmedabad: Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary Niranjan Shah on Saturday expressed disappointment over Indias humiliating defeat against Sri Lanka in the first Test in Colombo, despite having so many senior batsmen in the squad.         
	It is disturbing that we lost despite having senior players like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman in the team. We need to look into the matter, said Shah, reacting to Indias humiliating innings and 239-run defeat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav is keeping fingers crossed 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sourav is keeping fingers crossed 
    - Shashank Manohar to meet selectors in Mumbai today             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: Nobody went on record, but its learnt that when a senior took on Shashank Manohar on the issue of contracts, before the 2006-07 tour of South Africa, he was brusquely asked to fall in line or face the consequences.         
	Apparently, the exchange went as follows: What if I and some of the others dont sign? the senior asked bluntly. Manohar, then a Board vice-president, is understood to have smashed that question out of the Mumbai venue where theyd been meeting. If you dont, youll be replaced.         
	The show of defiance ended right there.         
	Clearly, over the years, the Boards new president has been known to be a hardliner on many issues (Jagmohan Dalmiya being one) and the seniors, whove served the country so well for seasons without number, can expect little sympathy when the chips are down.         
	This, perhaps, needs to be borne in mind in the lead-up to the new selection committees first meeting  in Mumbai, on Wednesday.         
	Significantly, Manohar will have a closed-door session with Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Co. before their meeting gets under way.         
	Manohar isnt driven by sentiment, but values performance Perform or perish is probably the message hed like to deliver through the selectors, said somebody who didnt wish to be identified.         
	The selectors will be picking the squad for the first Test against Australia, in Bangalore, from October 9. They may do so for the second, in Mohali, as well.         
	The Nagpur-based Manohar, one learns, is scheduled to reach Mumbai a couple of hours before Srikkanth and his colleagues on the committee (the Boards first without honorary status)  Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat  begin discussions at the Cricket Centre.         
	Except Yashpal, whod unceremoniously been thrown out three years ago, nobody has any experience of doing duty as a national selector.         
	Owing to the Sourav Ganguly factor, Easts Venkat will be under more pressure than he normally wouldve been.         
	Sourav was in the last Test squad, in Sri Lanka, but a poor run there saw him being ignored for the just-ended Irani Trophy. He hasnt been called to the ongoing camp in Bangalore either.         
	Yes, because of the hype (over Sourav), I suppose theres pressure, but Ill be able to handle it, Venkat told The Telegraph, before leaving for Mumbai.         
	He added: Srikkanth is an easy going person... Hes been in touch with everybody on the commmitee and his agenda is clear  to select the best team... His point is that we shouldnt get divided on regional lines, but pick the team to beat Australia... To get the right combination... Weve indeed been entrusted with a big responsibility.         
	Sourav, it appears, himself spent much of Tuesday keeping fingers crossed. Hell have to remain that way till the squad is announced.         
	The last selection committee, headed by Dilip Vengsarkar, sent out a very clear signal by overlooking Sourav for the Irani. The Team India coach, Gary Kirsten, and Test captain Anil Kumble seem to have played an indirect part in that decision.         
	If that indeed happened, then it doesnt at all look good for the 36-year-old.         
	Sourav, in fact, was contemplating quitting after being ignored for the Irani, but decided to wait for the new selection committee.         
	The question, today, is: Will the selectors go by Souravs achievements in the recent past  MoM in the last Test at home (Kanpur, in March 2008), versus South Africa; good performances in the first two Tests of the December 2007-January 2008 series in Australia; MoM in the last Test in Bangalore (239 and 91 against Pakistan, in December 2007)  or wholly go by his 96 runs in the three Tests in Sri Lanka?         
	Nobody can defend that performance, but if failure in one series is the yardstick, the selectors must be consistent in wielding the axe.         
	Barring injuries, for a number of reasons, 10 of the 11 expected to take the field in Bangalore select themselves: Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S.Laxman, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma.         
	Souravs available for the 11th slot, but Tamil Nadus Subramaniam Badrinath is being backed by many with big influence.         
	Assuming only 14 are selected (though one of the selectors indicated 15 would be better), then Munaf Patel and a third spinner  Piyush Chawla or Amit Mishra or Pragyan Ojha  have to be in the squad.         
	If Souravs in, the remaining slot will be Badrinaths. If the latter is picked to be in the 11, then another batsman will have to be in the squad. Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina are strong contenders.         
	Actually, quite a few must be doing a Sourav, keeping fingers crossed, that is.

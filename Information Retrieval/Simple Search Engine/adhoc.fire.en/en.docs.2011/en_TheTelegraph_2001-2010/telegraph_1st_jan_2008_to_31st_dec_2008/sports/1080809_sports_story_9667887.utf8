The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir: Still feel   were in the game
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gambhir: Still feel   were in the game
            A CORRESPONDENT            Gautam Gambhir in Colombo on Friday. (AFP)                                 
	Colombo: India have been dismissed for a meagre 249 in their first innings, but opener Gautam Gambhir, the highest scorer in Indias first innings, believes his team still had a chance to make a comeback, if the bowlers pick up a few early wickets on Saturday morning.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	On Indias first-innings score         
	We should have got a much higher score than what we got at the end of the day but this is part and parcel of Test cricket. Ups and downs happen. It is important to win sessions. I still feel we are very much in the game if we can have one or two early wickets in the morning, we can be right back in the game.         
	On the Murali-Mendis combination         
	The amount of bowling he and Murali are doing in this series, they are the two bowlers who are going to take most of the wickets. We have a very quality batting line-up, we have shown it in Galle. I think we are very much in the game.         
	Mendiss bowling         
	There was hardly any grass on the surface. He bowled really well, in the right channel. That is what is really important on this kind of a track where there is hardly any help for the fast bowlers. He bowled in the right areas.         
	Indias last-wicket partnership         
	At one stage, we were 198 for nine and from there having a 50-run last-wicket partnership, they got us slightly back in the game. Especially after picking up one wicket late in the day, they have really got us back in the game.         
	The P. Sara wicket         
	It is a fantastic wicket to bat on. There was hardly anything for the bowlers, nothing for the fast bowlers and nothing for the spinners. It is just that we didnt bat well. We should have got a much higher score than what we did.         
	Why the Indian middle order has been unable to pick Mendis while he has been doing so regularly         
	Very difficult to answer this question. They are quality players. Its just that I am in good nick, I am really feeling good about my batting, my balance and everything. The important thing is to keep going out there and doing it again and again. This is what Test cricket and international cricket is all about.         
	What measures are they taking to rectify their mistakes?         
	Everyone must be analysing what mistakes they are making. They have played enough cricket to analyse what mistakes they are making. Its important to rectify those mistakes and move ahead and that is what we have to do in the second innings. There is one more innings to go which is the most important innings of this series. It is 1-1. We must be looking forward to the next innings rather than thinking about what has happened today (Friday).         
	Meanwhile, Sri Lankan pacer Dammika Prasad, who had a three-wicket haul on his debut on Friday, told the media that Sachin Tendulkars wicket was the one that made him happiest.                 
	The following are excerpts:         
	Did you feel any pressure making your debut against the famed Indian batting line-up?         
	Although this is my first Test Match, I had played the warm up game against them and I got three wickets and that gave me some confidence. So that took off some pressure. I knew I could do it.         
	How was the first days experience at the Test level?         
	I am really enjoying what I am doing. It was good to bowl on this wicket. I had a lot of confidence and ended up getting three wickets here.         
	Which of the wickets do you value most?         
	They have a fine batting line up. One of my favourite players is Sachin. It was a big moment for me to take that wicket. I am really happy.         
	What were you thinking when Virender Sehwag was going hammer and tongs?         
	At that time I was a bit nervous as I am a newcomer. Sehwag is in form as well. Although I was nervous, I managed to get that wicket and that gave me more confidence.         
	What did the captain and the seniors tell you?         
	They were saying that not to think this is your first game. Bowl the way you do.

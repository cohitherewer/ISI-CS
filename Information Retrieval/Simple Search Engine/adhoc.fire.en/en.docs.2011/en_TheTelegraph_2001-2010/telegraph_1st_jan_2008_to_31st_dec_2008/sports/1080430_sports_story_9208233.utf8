            A STAFF REPORTER              Aloke Mukherjee                            
	Calcutta: Coach Aloke Mukherjee is confident that East Bengal will stay alive in the AFC Cup ahead of their crucial encounter against Al Safa of Lebanon on Wednesday even though the absence of key forward Edmilson is hanging heavy on the hosts.         
	The Brazilian scored one of the goals in 2-4 loss to Al Wihdat of Jordan in the previous match at the Salt Lake Stadium two weeks back. He received the marching orders in that match.         
	Compounding Alokes woes further, defender M. Suresh will also be unavailable against the Lebanese outfit. Rahim Nabi, who scored the other goal against Al Wihdat at home, is also a doubtful started owing to an ankle niggle.         
	Alvito D Cunha is not fully fit, but he is expected to take the field.         
	Edmilsons absence will be felt. But we will stay positive and play accordingly, the East Bengal coach said on Tuesday after a half-an-hour-long practice at the club ground.         
	The defeat to Al Wihdat made East Bengal slip two spots behind group leaders Al Safa with two games to play.         
	But a win over the leaders on Wednesday will leave them with a chance to make the last-eight stage when they travel to Yemen for the final round encounter against Ahli Sana.         
	A 17-member Al Safa squad, who arrived in the city on Monday night, had an hour-long training session at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Its too hot out here, Al Safa coach Amir Saad said.         
	The visitors are likely miss key player Amir Khan. There are three foreigners in the side. The 19-year-old Bobby Prince is from Ghana while Miller and Mbassi are from Cameroon.

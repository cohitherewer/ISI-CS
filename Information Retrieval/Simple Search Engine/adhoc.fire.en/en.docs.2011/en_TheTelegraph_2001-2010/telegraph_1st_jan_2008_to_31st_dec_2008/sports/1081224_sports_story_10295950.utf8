The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India regain No. 2 spot
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India regain No. 2 spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Team India have reclaimed second position from South Africa in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship after their 1-0 win over England in the two-Test series.         
	For the hosts who won the first Test in Chennai by six wickets and drew the second one in Mohali on Tuesday, the win was enough to earn them two ratings points and overtake South Africa in the second spot.         
	Incidentally, India had briefly enjoyed the second position after their 2-0 home series victory over Australia.         
	However, the Proteas can once again regain the second position if they win their current three-match series against Australia by 2-1 or 2-0. Even a 1-1 draw will help them earning them the spot.         
	Graeme Smiths side can even leapfrog table topper Australia by a fraction of a point if they win the remaining two Tests to sweep the series 3-0.         
	Meanwhile, if Australia win the last two Tests they will not only widen the gap with South Africa but will also dash the Proteas hopes of regaining second position from India.

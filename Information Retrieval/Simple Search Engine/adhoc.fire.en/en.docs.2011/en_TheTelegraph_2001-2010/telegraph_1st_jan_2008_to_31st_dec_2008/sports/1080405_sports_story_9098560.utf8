	Calcutta: South Africas Haroon Lorgat has been appointed the new chief executive of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the governing body announced on Friday.         
	The 47-year-old Lorgat will take over from Malcolm Speed after the governing bodys annual conference on June 29, the ICC said in a statement. Lorgat, a former South Africa chief selector, was chosen a week after his compatriot Imtiaz Patel turned down the offer.         
	The new appointment was confirmed by the board after Lorgat met the ICC president-elect David Morgan in Pretoria on Wednesday. The recruitment committee, comprising ICC president Ray Mali, Morgan, Sharad Pawar, who will be the vice-president once Morgan takes charge, and director Creagh Connor also cleared him. Lorgat, a former first class cricketer, headed the selection panel from 2004 until last year.

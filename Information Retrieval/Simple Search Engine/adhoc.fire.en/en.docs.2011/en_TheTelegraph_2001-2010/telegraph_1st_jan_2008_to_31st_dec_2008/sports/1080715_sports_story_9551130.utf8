	London: South Africa batted for almost six full sessions to draw the first Test against England on Monday.         
	When stumps were drawn midway through the evening session at Lords, with England employing part-time spinners Kevin Pietersen and Alastair Cook, South Africa had progressed to 393 for three, a lead of 47.         
	The visitors began their follow-on innings after being dismissed on Saturday for 247. Having lost 10 wickets in a single day and needing 346 to make England bat again, South Africas chances of saving the match seemed remote.         
	But Neil McKenzie, captain Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla all scored centuries in the final two days. Their dogged defence and perseverance was aided by a flat pitch and an England attack that lacked penetration. After the match, the England selectors added allrounder Andrew Flintoff to the squad for the second Test starting in Leeds on Friday.         
	After Smith was dismissed late on Sunday for 107, McKenzie and Amla put on 125 for the second wicket to take the game away from England, which had made 593 for eight.         
	By the time McKenzie was dismissed for 138 and Jacques Kallis for 13 after lunch, it was too late for England to mount a late charge.         
	Amla finished on 104 not out, his fifth Test century and first against England. He occupied the crease for 344 minutes and faced 242 balls to keep England at bay. Ashwell Prince, who scored a century in the first innings, ended on 9 not out after being dropped on 0 and 2.         
	The second innings, though, belonged to McKenzie. When James Anderson induced the opener to chase one outside off stump, he ended a 554-minute innings that began on Saturday. McKenzie had just called for a runner before he was dismissed after injuring his groin, but is expected to be fit for the second Test.         
	When McKenzie pushed the ball through point Sunday to bring up his fifth Test century in 384 minutes, he eclipsed Gary Kirstens record for the slowest South African century against England by two minutes.         
	The only South African top-order batsman not to enjoy a lengthy spell at the crease was Kallis. The match was drifting to a gentle draw when Ryan Sidebottom managed to swing a delivery back at Kallis and bowl him.         
	The dismissal was unexpected as Sidebottom was struggling bowl quickly after suffering from a sore back. He was bowling with such a lack of pace that wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose stood up to the stumps in the morning session.

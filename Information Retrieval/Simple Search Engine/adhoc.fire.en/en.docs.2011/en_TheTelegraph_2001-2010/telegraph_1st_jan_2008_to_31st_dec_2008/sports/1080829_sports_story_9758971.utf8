The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra harden stand on transfer
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mahindra harden stand on transfer
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Mahindra United on Thursday hardened their stand on N.P. Pradeep and Steven Dias after the status committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) asked the Mumbai outfit to settle the matter amicably with East Bengal.         
	The committee, which met in the capital under the chairmanship of K.P. Sunny, has asked the two clubs to discuss and resolve the matter before September 5.         
	Both Pradeep and Dias, despite having two-year and three-year contracts respectively with Mahindra United, chose to sign for East Bengal in the inter-state transfers. To break the deadlock, the AIFF had referred the matter to the status committee.         
	While East Bengal and the two players are hopeful that things may turn in favour of the Calcutta club after the status committee directives, Mahindra sources clearly stated that the club was not in favour of any negotiations.         
	The final decision rests in the hands of the Mahindra United president, but on principle we are against any negotiation. As per the law, the two players should be playing for Mahindra this season and we are not going to give up our rights on that.         
	Under the present circumstances, Mahindra are unlikely to release the two players even if East Bengal offer a transfer fee. In that case, the AIFF will have no other option but to cancel the inter-state transfer applications of the two footballers.         
	Both Pradeep and Dias told the status committee that last season they had received a verbal assurance from the Mumbai club that in the event of a better offer from any other club they would be released.

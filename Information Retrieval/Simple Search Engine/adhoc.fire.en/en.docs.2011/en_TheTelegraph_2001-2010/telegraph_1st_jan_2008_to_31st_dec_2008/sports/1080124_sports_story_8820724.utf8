                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS

           
	Ranatunga for Sir Sachin 
 
	Colombo: Arjuna Ranatunga shares British Prime Minister Gordon Browns view that Sachin Tendulkar should be knighted.
 
	I think he is one of the top batsmen produced by the cricketing world. He has achieved a lot and I dont think any cricketer will have problems if he gets the coveted title, said the former Sri Lanka skipper. 
    
	Ranatunga, who is also the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chairman, lauded Tendulkars sportsman spirit. He is a good sport. I have played a lot of cricket with him. We never had any problems with umpiring decisions. Whenever he is out, he always walks. 
    
	Ranatunga said Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev also deserve to be knighted. 
    
	First Test vs SA from March 26 
    
	 Mumbai: South Africa will play the first Test of their tour of India in Chennai from March 26-30, the BCCI said in a statement released on Wednesday.

	The visitors will open with a three-day fixture against India A in Mumbai from March 20.

	CA-PCB meeting 
    
	 Karachi: A senior Cricket Australia (CA) official has confirmed that the heads of the Aussie and Pakistan cricket boards are likely to have talks in the next three or four days on the March-April series. The series runs the danger of being cancelled due to security concerns raised by the touring side. 
    
	Peter Young, the media manager of CA, told Geo Television on Wednesday that the heads of the two boards will have formal talks on the series but it could be either over telephone or across the table in Dubai. 
    
	Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik, meanwhile, denied growing rumours of a possible rift in the team, saying he had no issues with Shahid Afridi. Some newspapers reported that Malik and coach Geoff Lawson didnt want Afridi in the team.

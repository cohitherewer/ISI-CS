    - EB start campaign today shabbirs men impress           A STAFF REPORTER            Theodore Sunday makes his way through the Railway FC defence at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting started their Sahara Calcutta Football League campaign with a 3-1 win over Railway FC at a rain-drenched Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Avijit Duttas own goal opened the scoreline for the men in black-and-white while Theodore Sunday and Lalchhuan Awma increased the margin in the first half.         
	Suraj Mondal pulled one back for Railway FC at the stroke of halftime.         
	The railway defence was to be blamed for letting in the first goal as early as the eighth minute. It opened the floodgates as Mohammedan Sporting made full use of the weak links in the rival defence, specially the right flank.         
	Captain Mike Okoro started off slightly deep to lend solidity to the midfield. Upfront Sunday and Under-19 lad Lalchhuan put the railway defence into disarray with their sporadic runs and quick interchange of positions. The attacks were built through short passes and the long rangers often took goalie Rakesh Prasad by surprise.         
	Satyajit Bose played a stellar role in the midfield showing good anticipation. His defence splitting passes were on target and never gave the rival forwards a free reign in the midfield.         
	Railway FCs Dutta in an attempt to clear the ball from a melee, following a free-kick, headed into the far corner of the net. The second goal came 11 minutes later. Satyajit moved down the right before getting past a couple of defenders on his way. Sunday was quick to pounce on to the resultant cross as he tapped it past an advancing Prasad.         
	The third goal was a reward for Mizoram boy Lalchhuans tireless efforts. After Okoros shot was blocked near the goalmouth, Lalchhuan headed in the rebound over the goalies head. Railway FCs Mondal scored after Kaltu Hembrem had done the hard work and placed the ball on a platter.

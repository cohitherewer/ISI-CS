The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajan, Zaheer have given us hope: Dravid
                                                                                                                                                                                             Harbhajan, Zaheer have given us hope: Dravid
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Rahul Dravid in action on Saturday                           
	Bangalore: Rahul Dravid feels the Harbhajan Singh-Zaheer Khan partnership has put India back on track. At a press conference, he said that a few more runs on the fourth morning would put the pressure back on Australia.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On scoring most of his runs down the leg side         
	The wicket was slow and low, and the bowlers were looking to bowl a lot straighter. So obviously leg side will become the scoring area The opportunity to score comes from that area. You have to work around the ball as well to that area once the ball gets old and starts to reverse swing. When the ball is new and hard, it becomes a bit easier.         
	The variable bounce on the wicket         
	You couldnt trust the bounce as much as you can do on a good wicket. You have to keep a good watch You can never feel comfortable even if you bat for a pretty long period, especially against the quicker bowlers One will come up and one will keep low.         
	His innings         
	I am pretty happy with the way I concentrated and played today (Saturday). Obviously, I would have liked to carry on a bit more. I will take this for a start to the series and hope to build on from here on in the coming weeks.         
	If teams winning the toss and batting first enjoy the advantage in India         
	Yeah, I think it happens because the wickets are on the slower and lower side So the team batting first will have that slight advantage. But I think that is not entirely the case here because they (Aussies) played really well and have a couple of hundreds and got a good total on the board helping to put pressure on us.         
	The game plan for the next two days         
	We still need to be positive. Anything can happen on this wicket. The 80-run partnership between Harbhajan and Zaheer has given us some hope. If we get some more runs tomorrow and then get some early wickets you never know what will happen. Obviously, we are a little behind at this stage of the game, but not so far that we cannot fight back. I think its going to be two interesting days of cricket from hereon.         
	Harbhajan, Zaheers partnership         
	I think they batted sensibly and cautiously against spinners early on. Once the faster bowlers returned and the ball was coming on to the bat they played their shots. They kept the runs coming and that was important at that stage. It was a critical partnership and helped us reach the position where we are now.         
	Mitchell Johnsons bowling         
	He bowled really well and got it to reverse swing. Sometimes when you bowl well you might not get wickets, but he made us play a lot of balls. His first spell in the morning was really good and then came back in the afternoon and bowled with some good pace.         
	The Aussie field placings         
	To be very honest, we were not surprised by their field placings and it was not much different from what they had done in 2004. On this kind of wicket and the kind of pace-oriented attack they have, we expected something like this from them  a sweeper and four men on the leg while looking to bowl wicket to wicket.         
	If there was any pressure on the seniors         
	No really I dont think so.         
	If playing an extra pacer would have helped         
	We have two top-class fast bowlers and two world class spinners. In India, and on these kind of wickets, such attacks have won us matches in the past. But I think this was the best attack we could have put up for this game.         
	Missing out on a hundred in Bangalore         
	It could have been nice to score a hundred here. I have grown up here and played a lot of Ranji matches and got some hundreds. But I have not had that kind of success here in Test cricket.         
	Harbhajans innings         
	Its always fun to watch Harbhajan bat Keeps you on your toes.

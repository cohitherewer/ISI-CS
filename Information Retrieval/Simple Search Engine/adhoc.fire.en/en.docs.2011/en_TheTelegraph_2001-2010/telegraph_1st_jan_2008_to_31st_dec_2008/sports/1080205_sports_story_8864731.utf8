   OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
   
	New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi has supported Sania Mirzas decision not to play in India.
 
	The 10-time Grand Slam champion, who arrived in the capital late on Monday to join the Davis Cup squad, told The Telegraph that Sania took the decision after consulting him.
 
	Yes, we had a discussion on this issue following which she announced it, Bhupathi said. We sincerely felt it would be good for her career, said Sanias mixed doubles partner and owner of Globosport, the sports and entertainment management company.
 
	Asked whether the move would have a negative effect on Sanias career, Bhupathi said: Perhaps it was time to arrive at such a decision. We may see some positive effect at the end of it.
 
	Frankly, we are not too bothered whether it would bring good or bad publicity, said Indias doubles sensation. Our only concern is to see what is good for Sania at the moment. Whatever she does somehow brings bad publicity and it is always blown out of proportion.
 
	It is an well-orchestrated campaign by a section of the media and there is one person behind it, Bhupathi, whose company manages Sania, said.
 
	Asked to name the person he was referring to, the Bangalore-based tennis star said: You are in the media. You should know it better than me.
 
	Bhupathi said that Sania would be playing in India in the future. It isnt a permanent decision. She wont play in India this year.

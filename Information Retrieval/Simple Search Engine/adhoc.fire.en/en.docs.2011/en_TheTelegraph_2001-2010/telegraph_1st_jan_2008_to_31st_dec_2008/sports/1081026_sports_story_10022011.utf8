The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky: Trying to cope with the conditions
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ricky: Trying to cope with the conditions

	New Delhi: Stung by the humiliating defeat against India in the second Test in Mohali, Australia captain Ricky Ponting on Saturday promised an improved performance in the rest of the series.         
	Australia, already down 0-1, face India in the third Test starting here from Wednesday, before taking on the hosts in the last Test starting in Nagpur from November 6.         
	Ponting admitted Indias emergence as a powerhouse and said his team was trying to come to terms with the conditions here.         
	We are trying to come back into the series. We are trying to cope with the conditions in India. Hopefully, we can put up a better show in the next two matches, Ponting said at a dinner hosted by the Australian High Commission here. The Australian High Commissioner, John McCarthy, also hoped that Pontings men would bounce back in the series and wished them luck for the remaining matches.         
	Meanwhile, injured pacer Stuart Clark will go through a final fitness test on Sunday to determine whether he has fully recovered from his elbow injury.         
	Meanwhile, Mitchell Johnson feels India would be under pressure ahead of the third Test despite leading 1-0 as the hosts would want to seal the four-Test series by wrapping up the issue in New Delhi.         
	The left-arm quick hoped the visitors would claw their way back into the series.         
	I think we can put a lot of pressure on the Indians. I think theyre going to be feeling it a little, being 1-0 up. I think all the pressures on them, so most of the guys are confident. When youre losing, theres disappointment but well get back on track, Johnson said.         
	Australia have been going through tormenting times after the battering they received in the last Test in Mohali, yet Johnson drew some positives.         
	To be honest, I dont think were too far away. There are a few good things, like Shane Watson batted very well and bowled well. Peter Siddle was outstanding on debut, youve got plenty of guys whove done well, Johnson told an Australian news agency.

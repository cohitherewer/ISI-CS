The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Game in city needs total revamp
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Game in city needs total revamp
  - Calcutta teams are unlikely to pose challenge for I-league title

	A few days ago, I read in the newspapers that national coach Bob Houghton was in the city to have a meeting with the coaches of the I-League teams. Reports said that Houghton had suggested holding camps for the national team every two months from the next year.  
	Given the fact that India will play in the final rounds of the Asian Cup in January 2011, it is not a bad idea to keep the national team together for a longer period and organise more training camps.         
	But I am afraid this arrangement may hamper the balance of domestic football in India.        
	While I fully agree that the national team should be given more importance, I am not sure how positively the clubs will react to such a situation.         
	At the same time, I sincerely hope that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has already chalked out a detailed plan to financially compensate the national team players in case the boys face a pay cut in the clubs for their long absence from the domestic season.        
	Talking about domestic football, I am very disappointed by the performance of the four Calcutta teams in the I-League.         
	Only five rounds have been played so far, but I am convinced that in the end, none of the teams from the eastern metropolis will be in a position to stake a serious claim for the title.         
	Frankly, I wont be surprised if a couple of them end up battling to avoid relegation.        
	These days, I do not go to the Maidan regularly.         
	But from what I read and get to hear from different sources, I feel the game in Calcutta needs a complete overhauling.         
	Otherwise, it will continue to languish at the bottom as it has been doing for the past couple of years.        
	More than the players and the coaches, what Calcutta football needs at the moment are quality administrators.         
	There were days when football had flourished in the city under people like Balaidas Chatterjee and Jyotish Chandra Guha.         
	They not only knew the game thoroughly but also were skilful enough to run the administration properly.        
	Yet, in terms of popularity, Calcutta still remains the hub of Indian football.         
	In Goa, the I-League matches are marked by poor turnouts. The situation is no better in Mumbai and Ludhiana.         
	The national federation should do something to bring the spectators back to the ground.        
	I am also finding it difficult to concentrate on the ongoing I-League because of Priyaranjan Das Munshis illness. I sincerely pray for the AIFF presidents speedy recovery, and hope he continues to lead the Indian football from the front as he has been doing for the past 20 years.        
	In the end, I would like to congratulate Sachin Tendulkar for becoming the highest run getter in Test cricket.         
	It is a great achievement, but to me, the more important factor is how he made those 12,000 runs.        
	I have been following Tendulkars career since the time he made his debut 19 years ago. What has impressed me most is his ability to do his job in the best possible manner without bragging about it.        
	I know many people who have not achieved even half of what Tendulkar has done so far.         
	However, they will seize every opportunity to blow their own trumpet. This way, Tendulkar is completely different. He only lets his bat do the talking. I wish he continues to flourish.

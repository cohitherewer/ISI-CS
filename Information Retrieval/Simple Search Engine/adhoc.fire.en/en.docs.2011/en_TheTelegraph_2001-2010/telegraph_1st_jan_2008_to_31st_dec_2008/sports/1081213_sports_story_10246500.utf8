The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vidarbha hold firm
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Vidarbha hold firm
                      
	Nagpur: Makeshift opener Madhusudhan Acharayas defiant 51 in 277 balls and useful contributions from captain Faiz Fazal (46) and Ravi Jangid (43) helped hosts Vidarbha put up 230 for four at stumps on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy Plate Group match against Bengal at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground here Friday.         
	The home team made slow progress in the early part of the innings as Acharaya blunted the Bengal pace attack with some resolute batting.         
	After the exit of Faiz Fazal, Acharaya along with Alind Naidu (37) saw the hosts on 86 for one at lunch.         
	The post-tea session saw Vidarbha lose Naidu and it was left to Achraya and Jangid to steady the ship.         
	Put into bat, the home team took to the field without skipper Preetam Gandhe and the experienced Sandeep Singh and Md Hashim, both ruled out due to injury.         
	However, M. Acharya in company of Faiz Fazal defended dourly denying Bengals four-pronged pace attack any breakthrough.         
	The pace duo of Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda went wicketless as the home team batted doggedly on a decent batting track.         
	Manoj Tiwary (two for 37) introduced late into the attack, emerged as the most successful bowler for the visitors while pacer Sourav Sarkar and Laxmi Ratan Shukla claimed a wicket each.

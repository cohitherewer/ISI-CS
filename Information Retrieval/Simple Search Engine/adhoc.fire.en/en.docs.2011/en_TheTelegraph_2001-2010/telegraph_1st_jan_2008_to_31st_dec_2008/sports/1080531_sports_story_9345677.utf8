The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vengsarkar: Sourav didnt fit in the combination
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vengsarkar: Sourav didnt fit in the combination
    - Everything points to the end of former Team India captains ODI career           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Sourav Ganguly                            
	Calcutta: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar has held out some hope still for Sourav Ganguly, but in reality everything points to the former Team India captains ODI career getting over.         
	The awesome run (11,363 runs in 311 ODIs, average of 41.02 with 22 hundreds and 72 fifties) seems to have reached a dead end.         
	Indeed, with Vengsarkar and his colleagues ignoring Sourav for the tri-series in Bangladesh and the Asia Cup in Pakistan, his best chance of making a comeback has gone.         
	The selectors, though, didnt exactly speak in the same language after Fridays meeting in Mumbai.         
	While one candidly said that the committee wouldnt look back and that Vengsarkar would have a word with Sourav and Rahul Dravid, the chief selector himself took a vastly different line.         
	No, I dont intend calling Sourav or anybody else for that matter I wouldnt say its a full-stop to Souravs ODI career In fact, anybody who plays remains eligible for selection Sourav didnt fit in the combination for the two tournaments, Vengsarkar pointed out, talking exclusively.         
	Well, if Sourav couldnt make it with senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar not available, its baffling how hell fit into the scheme of things once the master is fit.         
	Actually, for all his achievements, theres no guarantee that Sachin wont meet the same fate as Sourav, who has been left devastated.         
	I dont wish to comment Right now, Im not thinking of my future in limited overs cricket Just dont wish to react, is all that Sourav told The Telegraph.         
	As reported in these columns, Souravs comeback was dependent on captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis backing. Dhoni, as it turned out, largely kept faith in the team which won him the tri-series in Australia.         
	Plenty of perks come a successful captains way, right at the top being having the biggest say in matters of selection.         
	One of the reasons for Souravs omission then had been that the large grounds in Australia wouldve exposed his fielding. Surely, the grounds in the subcontinent are different         
	Perhaps, having been a powerful captain in his days is working to Souravs disadvantage.         
	Dhonis fairly new to the job and would probably feel much more comfortable with somebody like Sourav not sharing the dressing room space.         
	Its not so much about insecurity, but having the freedom to call all the shots all the time.         
	Today, then, Sourav has little choice but to focus wholly on Test cricket. Hell soon be 36 and should look to continuing from where hed left off in Team Indias last Test  against South Africa, in Kanpur, where he was the MoM.         
	Dravids in the same boat. If anything, he got dumped there before Sourav.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting wants him back
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ponting wants him back
                      
	Melbourne: Australian skipper Ricky Ponting lauded Andrew Symonds for owning up his mistakes and said the troubled allrounders public apology is the first step towards his comeback to the team.         
	I actually think there were some really positive signs over the last couple of days with Andrew. Hes actually fronted the media and admitted that theres some room for improvement in certain parts of his life, Ponting said.         
	Symonds, who has been sacked for lack of commitment after going on a fishing trip instead of attending a team meeting, had apologised for his actions and promised to return a reformed man.         
	Ponting said the admission has made him confident about the big-hitting allrounders return.         
	Hes a terrific player and his Test record and one-day record over the last couple of years for Australia has been outstanding, the skipper said.         
	Hopefully for him as a person, if he can get those things sorted out, then well have him back in the team. I would love to have him back in the side sooner rather than later, he said.         
	On Tuesday Symonds, in his first interaction with the media since his sacking from the side for lacking commitment, said: I apologise for some of the things Ive done over the last little bit. Hopefully Ill come out of it a better person and not make those mistakes in the future.

                                                  Logie sees Curtly shadow in Ishant
                  Logie feels on-field banter has become too personal                     
	Mumbai: Former West Indies batsman and coach of the Bermuda Under-19 World Cup squad, Augustine Logie, feels that the current lot of cricketers has taken on-field banter to a personal level which is wrong.         
	Referring to the unsavoury incidents during the Sydney Test, Logie said that cricketers should avoid making personal comments.         
	Even we were aggressive and players during my time also exchanged a few words. But that was of a different kind It had humour in it and the players from both sides would share a laugh, Logie said.         
	The former West Indies batsman said he had been impressed by the way Indians have changed their attitude and faced the fast bowlers on their tours of England, South Africa and Australia in recent times.         
	The Indian team is no longer afraid of playing against the Aussies in Australia and have proved it with their recent performance, he said.         
	Sourav (Ganguly), (Virender) Sehwag and especially Sachin Tendulkar gave them a tough time and (V.V.S.) Laxman played a pivotal role during the series, Logie said, adding that young Ishant Sharma reminded him of former West Indian pace great Curtly Ambrose.         
	I am particularly impressed with Ishant and watching him felt like watching a young Ambrose.         
	Logie said that cricketers playing out there were role models and he had his reservations whether either Ricky Ponting or Andrew Symonds would invite Harbhajan Singh at their residence in the wake of the recent bad blood between the two parties.         
	We did have our differences but at the end of the day we went to the opposition dressing room to congratulate them on their performance. I wonder whether (Ricky) Ponting or (Andrew) Symonds would invite (Harbhajan) Singh to their house likewise, said the player.           (PTI)

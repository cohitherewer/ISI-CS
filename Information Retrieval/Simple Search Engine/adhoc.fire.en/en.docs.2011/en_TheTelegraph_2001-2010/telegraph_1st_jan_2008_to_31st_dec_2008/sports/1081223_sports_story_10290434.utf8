                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kevin too is useless: Yuvi
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Yuvraj Singh in action on Day IV of the second Test at the PCA Stadium in Mohali on Monday. (PTI)                           
	Mohali: Yuvraj Singh said on Monday that if he was a useless bowler, then Kevin Pietersen too was a useless batsman.         
	Reacting to the England captains remark that Yuvraj was a pie chucker, the Indian lefthander said: I got up in the morning and read the newspaper and thought what does that mean? It means useless bowlerit means KP (Pietersen) is getting out to me and a useless bowler getting a batsman out five times means the batsman too is useless.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Kevin Pietersen calling him a pie-chucker         
	(Laughs) I knew this would be the first question. Frankly, I got up in the morning and read the newspaper and thought what does that mean? It means useless bowlerit means KP (Pietersen) is getting out to me and a useless bowler getting a batsman out five times means the batsman too is useless.         
	On what he thinks of Pietersen as a player         
	He is a phenomenal player, batted like a champion Sunday. After all, he has 15 centuries in 45 Tests. He tried to get under my skin and it brought out the best in me. And when I tried to get under his skin it brought out the best in him. Its okay but I dont like to wash dirty linen in public.         
	Getting Pietersen out so many times         
	Yes, I got him out five times now, three times in the last ODI series and twice in the Tests. But then, we play so much cricket, you are bound to get out to someone. He hates my bowling.         
	His feeling after Pietersen called him a pie-chucker         
	Mixed bag of feelings inside. At the end of the day, everything is left on the ground. KP and I are good friends off the field, but not on the field. On the field we are playing for the country. Yesterday, MS (Dhoni) told me to come and bowl. He (Pietersen) almost scooped up the fifth ball. It made him stronger and he scored a hundred.         
	How he rates Pietersen as a bowler         
	(Laughs) I have got a better action than KP, his action is useless! If he works hard he can be a good bowler. He is an exceptional batsman; I like to watch him bat. I can give him some tips and teach how to bowl in the rough.         
	On having the habit of chatting with the opposition         
	Well, sometimes it fires me up and sometimes it backfires. It backfired in the first innings in Chennai, but fired me up in the next innings. Its all healthy competition and no bad mouthing. Both the teams are trying to push the opposition.         
	On being the target of all the chatting         
	Perhaps because of my batting in the Twenty20 World Cup... They want to get me out as quickly as possible.         
	His assessment of the year 2008 for Indian cricket         
	Looking back, Commonwealth Bank win, ICC World Twenty20 win and Test series win over Australia in India were great. I think the team is gelling really well, playing as a team We enjoy each others success, if we are under pressure we know there are a bunch of guys who can do something special Come up with an exceptional knock or spell. Bowling has been really good with Harbhajan (Singh), Zaheer (Khan) and Ishant (Sharma) doing so well.

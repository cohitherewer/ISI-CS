The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin: Ive more cricket left in me
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sachin: Ive more cricket left in me
                  Sachin Tendulkar                     
	New Delhi: Nineteen years of international cricket may have taken a toll on his body but Sachin Tendulkar on Saturday made it clear that he has no immediate plans of quitting, saying he definitely has cricket left in him.         
	Theres definitely cricket left in me, the 35-year-old champion batsman, who has been plagued by a spate of injuries in recent times, said in interview to a TV channel.         
	Tendulkars nagging injuries and periodic form slumps had prompted a few former cricketers, including former Australia captain Ian Chappell to call for his retirement a couple of years back but the ace batsman says he was still enjoying the game and was hungry for runs.         
	In the interview, the batting great talked at length about his life and career. He recalled the disappointment after Indias first round exit from the 2007 World Cup.         
	He admitted the 2007 World Cup debacle was particularly disappointing but he managed to retain his hunger.         
	It was a disappointing moment A huge disappointing moment. But I came back and I started working on my game. I trained harder and I wanted to perform better, said Tendulkar, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in world cricket with a record 39 Test centuries.         
	Over the years, Tendulkar achieved what remained dreams for lesser mortals and the best compliment probably came from Sir Donald Bradman who saw his own shadow in the Mumbaikar.         
	Asked about his personal choice, Tendulkar reveals the special place he has in his heart for a certain West Indian.         
	I think that someone that I would like to watch is Brian Lara. I think hes special, Tendulkar said.         
	About on-field skirmishes, like the sydney racism row involving teammate Harbhajan Singh, and whether cricket remains a gentlemans game, Tendulkar said, now that theres a lot of media attention on the players, and everything is put under a microscope so sometimes its blown out of proportion, sometimes the player is at fault.         
	Tendulkar has seen many an innovation since his 1989 debut and the ongoing Indian Premier League is perhaps the most radical of them. He reckoned IPL is not just cricket, but the Twenty20 extravaganza has probably evolved into a social phenomenon.         
	Its a lot to do with the families, you know the outings in the evenings. It used to be the cinema, watching a movie or a play But now its the evenings In the form of a cricket match where the whole family goes out together, he said.           (PTI)

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yuki, partner bow out
                      
	London: Yuki Bhambris challenge at the Wimbledon Championships ended on a dismal note after he made a first round exit in the boys doubles event along with Chinese partner Ze Zhang.         
	The unseeded Indo-Chinese pair lost 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 9-11 to Australian combine of Jared Easton and Andrew Thomas in a rain-affected match.         
	Yuki had also crashed out of the singles competition in the first round itself. Poojashree Venkatesh had disappointed with her first round exit in the girls singles event.         
	The Delhi players best performance at junior Grand Slams this year remains his singles semi-final appearance at the Australian Open.         
	The 15-year-old teen had cut a sorry figure at the French open too after failing to go beyond the first round in singles and second round in the doubles competition.

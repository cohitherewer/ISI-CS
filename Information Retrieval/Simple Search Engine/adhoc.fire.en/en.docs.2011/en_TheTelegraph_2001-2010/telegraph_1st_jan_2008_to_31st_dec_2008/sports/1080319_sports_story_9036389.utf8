                                                   CA invites Ashraf for discussions
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia chairman Creagh Connor has invited his Pakistan Cricket Board counterpart Nasim Ashraf to Australia to discuss re-scheduling of the Australian teams Pakistan tour, according to a press release. The tour was put-off due to security concerns earlier this month.         
	Dr Ashraf and I have taken the opportunity to catch up during the current International Cricket Council board meeting in Dubai and we have had a preliminary look at dates which might be suitable to reschedule the matches, Mr Connor said from Dubai.         
	I have assured the PCB that Australia is committed to finding new dates, and we are committed to the ICC principle that cricket will only develop as a genuine global sport if all nations play each other away and at home on a regular basis.         
	It is clear from our initial discussion here in Dubai that we need to sit down and go through the technical issues on finding new dates with a fine tooth comb.

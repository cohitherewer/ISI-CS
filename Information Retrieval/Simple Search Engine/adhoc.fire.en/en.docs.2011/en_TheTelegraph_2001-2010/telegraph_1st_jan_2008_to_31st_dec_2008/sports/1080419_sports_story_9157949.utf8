	Bangalore: Already without Shoaib Akhtar, the Kolkata Knight Riders suffered another blow with West Indies captain Chris Gayle not boarding the long haul-flight from the Caribbean owing to a groin injury.         
	Hes out for a fortnight at least, a spokesman for the Knight Riders told The Telegraph.         
	Gayle was to have arrived in the early hours of Friday and while he wouldnt have played the opener against the Bangalore Royal Challengers, he wouldve been in the XI at the Eden on Sunday.

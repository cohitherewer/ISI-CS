                                                    Pak squeeze out 5-wkt win

         Nasir Jamshed 
          
	Hyderabad (Pakistan): Opener Nasir Jamshed smashed a fluent 74 to help Pakistan pull off an unconvincing five-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the second one-day International on Thursday. 
    
	Chasing 239 to go two up, flamboyant allrounder Shahid Afridi came to Pakistans rescue with a powerful 43 not out from 27 balls after Zimbabwe had reduced the hosts to 178 for five in the 38th over. 
    
	Afridi, who struck four boundaries and two sixes, and Mohammed Yousuf (38 not out) added 61 from 52 balls in an unbroken sixth-wicket partnership to guide Pakistan home with 22 balls to spare at the Niaz Stadium. 
    
	Several dropped catches also hurt Zimbabwes cause. 
    
	Afridi was let off on 32 and 36, Jamshed on 6 and 72, and Yousuf on 29 on a flat batting pitch. 
    
	Zimbabwe removed opener Salman Butt early on when he was caught-behind by Tatenda Taibu for 17 off Elton Chigumbura. 
    
	Jamshed produced some explosive shots as he and Younis Khan (35) put on a free-flowing 95 from 80 balls. 
    
	The left-hander, who scored a half-century on his ODI debut in Karachi on Monday, continued his hot streak as he smashed 14 fours in his 64-ball knock.

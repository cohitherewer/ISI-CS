                                                     Carvalhos volte-face
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Carvalho                           
	New Delhi: Joaquim Carvalho hinted on Thursday that he could reconsider his decision to resign as the national hockey coach.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph over the phone, the beleaguered coach, who had stepped down with his support staff in the wake of Indias failure to qualify for the Olympic Games, said he would discuss the issue after meeting Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) officials in Delhi.         
	I am going to Delhi on Tuesday to meet the IHF president, KPS Gill, for a detailed discussion on Indias failure in Santiago.         
	Let me first find out what the federation has to say. Then only can I talk to you on this subject.         
	IHF sources indicated that Gill is in favour of continuing with Carvalho despite criticism from all quarters.         
	On Thursday, Gill said: We havent received his (Carvalhos) resignation. So there is no question of accepting it. He is still the coach. Its not fair to blame just one individual for the defeat against Great Britain. There were many factors and we will discuss and analyse everything.         
	Carvalho also made it clear that he had not put in his papers yet, at least officially.         
	On if he had already sent his resignation to the IHF, Carvalho said: That is one thing I wont like to tell you at the moment. Let me clarify it when I come to Delhi.         
	The national coach complained that some forces had conspired to keep India away from the next Olympic Games.         
	From what I gathered, it was very important for many to see that Great Britain qualify for Beijing, he said.         
	London will host the next Olympic Games after Beijing. It was very important for Britain to qualify. So, Britain were greatly helped by the umpires, Carvalho said.         
	Echoing Gills sentiments, the former India player said: We just had a bad day. It is all part of the game. After all, one team had to lose.         
	IHF sources indicated that Gill is keen on retaining Carvalho as there is immense pressure on him to appoint Australian legend Ric Charlesworth as the national coach on a long term basis for the next Olympics.         
	The IHF secretary (K Jyothikumaran) is extremely upset with Gill, said the source. He is toying with the idea of exposing the poor handling of affairs in the federation.

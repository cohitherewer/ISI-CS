	Karachi: Former and present Asian greats on Saturday called on cricket administrators to wisely use the Twenty20 format and make every effort to preserve Test cricket.         
	Speaking at a seminar organised by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on the topic Asian cricket: past, present and future, Wasim Akram said administrators should realise that Twenty20 cricket was pure entertainment and should be treated as such. Its a great way to globalise cricket but care should be taken to avoid over-exposing it at the cost of Test or one-day cricket, Akram stated.         
	England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Giles Clarke said that Cricket Australias proposal of conducting a world Test championship has been discussed briefly at the recently-concluded ICC committee meeting.         
	Test cricket is the ultimate game of cricket and it cannot be replicated by the shorter version of the game, he said. CAs suggestion to hold a world Test championship has been discussed briefly in Dubai.         
	Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga said India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka should help Bangladesh lift the standard of their game at the international level. Ranatunga, the outgoing ACC president, felt the big Asian countries should join hands to help Bangladesh.         
	Ranatunga also said although Pakistan have hosted a successful Asia Cup, hosting Champions Trophy was a different ball game.         
	It will have big teams unlike the Asia Cup, so one has to be patient to see how it goes. It is normal procedure that not only western countries but every country wants to be sure about its players safety, he said.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) also reassured Pakistan of its support for hosting the Champions Trophy, insisting it never doubted the successful organisation of the elite tournament. Niranjan Shah, BCCI secretary, felt that the success of the Asia Cup was essential for the Champions Trophy, considered the second biggest cricket tournament after the World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United, but for how long?

	After a day of intensive talks, Englands cricketers took their first decisive step towards continuing their tour of India on Wednesday, booking their passage to Abu Dhabi with a full retinue of fit, first-choice players. There were thought to be a couple of refuseniks but until the team receive a completed security report, expected by the weekend, every member of the original Test squad, bar the injured Ryan Sidebottom, has travelled to the Gulf, where they will practise with nine members of Englands performance squad.         
	There appears to have been a compromise here, which may explain why it has taken so long for a decision to be made. According to sources close to the team, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had wanted players to confirm they would travel to India before getting on the plane to Dubai, from whence they will transfer to Abu Dhabi. Yet, some of the players did not want to commit to further travel until the players representative, Sean Morris, could confirm that security requests in India had been put in place.         
	The composition of the nine-strong performance squad, seven bowlers and two allrounders, suggests that the ECB may be expecting a degree of defection among the first-choice bowlers. When England first returned last Saturday, a report named Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison as two unlikely to return to India whatever the security reports said, a situation, judging from the bowler-strong back-up squad, that probably has not changed.         
	Sean Morris, and namesake Hugh, Englands general manager, will travel to India and link up with the security officer, Reg Dickason. Everyone has worked extremely closely on this issue and the players have been fully supportive throughout, said Sean Morris. We will access the highest calibre of security advice on a regular basis so that we can provide the players with the latest accurate information.         
	Ive been assured by the ECB that they would never compromise the players safety and security. Hugh and I are travelling to India this weekend to confirm for the players that the security is of the high standard we all demand.         
	Until their meeting ended on Wednesday, the Morrises had been locked in talks with security advisers and Government agencies for 72 hours. By going halfway, essentially to a holding pen, resolution has still not occurred. With some players still traumatised by the atrocities in Mumbai, it would be no surprise if they were not to venture further east on Monday, the day they are scheduled to leave for Chennai.         
	The only consideration in all our discussions has been the safety and security of the team and support staff, said Hugh Morris, after talks had ended. While weve sought to reassure players that their safety is paramount, weve not pressurised any player into making the trip against their will.         
	Those who leave for Abu Dhabi are all anticipating travelling to India if both Sean and I are happy that Reg Dickasons security plans have been activated. The Board and players will be kept fully informed.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

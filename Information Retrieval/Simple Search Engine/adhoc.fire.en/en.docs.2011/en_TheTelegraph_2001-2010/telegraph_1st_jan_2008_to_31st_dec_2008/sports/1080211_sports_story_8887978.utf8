                                                I owe everything to the RCGC: Chowrasia
    - Caddie-turned-pro creates history with maiden European Tour triumph             OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            S.S.P. Chowrasia with the trophy       
	New Delhi: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia, who turned professional 11 years ago, fired a bogey-free five-under 67 on Sunday to score a stunning mdash; and his maiden mdash; victory on the European Tour by claiming the Indian Masters at the Delhi Golf Club.         
	Later, the modest Calcuttan took questions from the media in general as also a couple from The Telegraph.   
	The following are excerpts   
	Q For the first time a golfer from Calcutta has won a title on the European Tour. How do you feel?  
	A Its definitely a big achievement and I think it would be a boost for the game in Calcutta. Personally, Calcutta is always very special to me. What I am today is because of that city and the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. It is a great club and I owe everything to it.  
	I am now planning to return to Calcutta immediately. I had planned to go to Indonesia but now I might cancel it. For the next one week, I hope to enjoy my holiday with my family and friends and well-wishers at the club.  
	How did you prepare yourself for today?  
	I came in two-and-a-half hours before the round began and I spent a lot of time on the driving range and the putting green. I concentrated a lot out there.  
	You shot rounds of 70, 71, 71 and hit a strong 67 in your final round. What was the key?  
	Normally I dont do too well in the final round but whenever Ive won a tournament Ive always shot a brilliant last round, usually five or six under. I think I played very good golf so Im very, very happy.  
	Tell us about your game on the first nine hellip;  
	I wasnt thinking too much about the win and all of the scoring out on the front nine because there was still half a round left. In the second half, all I wanted to do was to score pars and to keep it going.  
	You shot four birdies on the front nine hellip;  
	I had a birdie on the first and then on the third I had a chip-in and another birdie at the fourth. At that point I felt I could go way ahead and I felt I would go a long way hellip;   
	What was going on in your mind during the final hole?  
	I was quite tense when I came to the 18th. But I was more tense at the tee because there were a few people walking across. I took my time and after the tee shot I was more relieved and relaxed.  
	What is the secret of your smile? Even when you bogey, you are seen smiling...  
	Well, there is no secret. I enjoy my golf because golf is all a mind game. So I just try to enjoy myself when I play golf.  
	What will you do now and where will you play?  
	I was just officially told by the European Tour that I have a card until 2010. I will be playing both in Asia and in Europe, but I will probably be playing more in Europe.  
	What will you do with the prize money?   
	Well, I havent thought about it and I really dont know what Im going to do with such a lot of money. Let me see.  
	How will this win inspire caddies?  
	More and more caddies will now take up the game and they will feel that they too can do well if they start playing and working with the game.   
	Why do you think that in the last 10 years not too many caddies have turned professional?  
	I feel that it has become very expensive to go out and play. Maybe they need more support.   
	Do you feel that after playing like this, you will get over the doubts you had about playing against the likes of Ernie Els?   
	Now I feel more confident playing against them. I feel now that I can stand up against the best in the world and Im now going to work on all my weak points even more.  
	Do you remember the first hotel you stayed at or the first place you played?   
	The first time I went away from home to play a golf tournament was to Pune. I was still very hesitant and scared because that was the first time I left my home. I overcame it and played my normal game.  
	Has Tiger Woods been an influence in your life?  
	Well, Ive learned a lot from watching Tiger play. And it feels so good to see Tiger winning from difficult positions. And since I have often come close and lost, I need to learn from Tiger.  
	What has been the key factor for your success as a golfer?  
	Its very simple. I believe in myself and I do everything with confidence.  
	Can golf be a game for the masses in India?  
	Could be. There should be more local golf courses, public golf courses and that will help the golfers a lot. Then there is a possibility that this game could even overtake cricket in popularity.

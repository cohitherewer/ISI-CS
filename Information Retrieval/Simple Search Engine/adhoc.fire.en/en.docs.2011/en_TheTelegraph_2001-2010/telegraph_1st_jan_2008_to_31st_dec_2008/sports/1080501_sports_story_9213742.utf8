The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights have task cut out
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Knights have task cut out
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Jaipur: The pink city of Jaipur is all set to witness a battle of wits between Shane Warne and Sourav Ganguly when the Rajasthan Royals meet the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL tie at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium on Thursday.         
	With Bollywood badshah Shah Rukh Khan also expected to be present at the picturesque stadium to back his team, the organisers are hoping for a full house.         
	The enthusiasm generated can be gauged from the fact that a host of youngsters defied the scorching afternoon heat to gather in and around the stadium to catch a glimpse of the Knight Riders stars. They were, however, disappointed when told that the visitors would only land late in the evening.         
	I was planning to get an autograph from Sourav, said one of the boys. We know (Ricky) Ponting and (Brendon) McCullum wont be there, but one good innings from Sourav can put our team in trouble.         
	The youngster was not far from the truth. Having suffered back to back defeats in the high-profile tournament, the Knight Riders, depleted by the absence of Ponting and McCullum, badly need a good innings from their skipper to beat the Rajasthan Royals, who have won three matches on the trot.         
	The Knight Riders will be strengthened by the inclusion of Salman Butt and Brad Hodge, their two new foreign recruits.         
	The Rajasthan Royals, tagged underdogs before the start of the meet, are on a roll. Coach-cum-captain Shane Warne has turned the team into a well-knit side. We are waiting for our fourth straight victory on Thursday, Warne said.         
	Though Warne refused to name his final eleven, Dmitri Mascarenhas, the only English cricketer in the IPL, is expected to replace Sohail Tanvir.         
	Theres no doubt Sourav and Warne will hold the key to any excitement this match could generate. They will need to come good in their respective departments to make an impact.

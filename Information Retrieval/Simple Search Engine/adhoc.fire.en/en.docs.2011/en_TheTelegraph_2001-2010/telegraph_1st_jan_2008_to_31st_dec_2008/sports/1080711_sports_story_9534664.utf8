                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kirmani support for Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER            Kirmani                           
	Calcutta: Former India wicketkeeper Syed Kirmani feels Sourav Ganguly should have been included among the 30 probables for the Champions Trophy.         
	Kirmani, who was in the city on Thursday to attend a function, said experience has no alternative.         
	You need experienced players in a team to guide the young ones. Thats why I think Sourav is still needed in Indias ODI team, Kirmani, a member of the World Cup winning Indian team, told reporters.         
	He supported Mahendra Singh Dhonis decision to take a break from the ensuing Test series, and said Dhoni was right in pointing out that too much cricket was being played. Its good that he has spoken about it. Otherwise nobody would have cared, he said.         
	Kirmani also shared his feelings about the silver jubilee celebrations of Indias World Cup victory.

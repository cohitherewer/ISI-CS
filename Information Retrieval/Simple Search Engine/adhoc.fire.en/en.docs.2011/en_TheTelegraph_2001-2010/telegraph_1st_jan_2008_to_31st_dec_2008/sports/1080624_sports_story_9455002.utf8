The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Irfan to miss opener
                                                                                                                                                                                           Irfan to miss opener
                      
	Karachi: India have decided to rest allrounder Irfan Pathan for their opening match of the Asia Cup against Hong Kong on Wednesday as the Baroda pacer is yet to recover from a side strain.         
	Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said there is no major injury concern with Irfan but it has been decided to give him some rest.         
	Irfan may play the second match on June 26 against hosts Pakistan.         
	The Indian team underwent a long and strenuous practice session under lights at the national stadium with Dhoni spent a long time at the nets. There were reports that Irfan has picked up a knee injury after the Kitply Cup last week, but Dhoni said: It was not serious and the left-arm pacer just needed some rest.         
	Dhoni said his team would start afresh in the Asia Cup, which he felt was an opportunity for the youngsters and a challenge for the senior players. We shall start from scratch in this tournament. We are not going to take any team lightly, said Dhoni.         
	I am happy with the team combination. I feel it is a good opportunity for the aspiring youngsters in such a big tournament..         
	Playing down the defeat to Pakistan last week in a tri-series final, Dhoni said every match was a new one. Its not a question of what you did in the past. Every day is a new day and we will have to perform well to win... Because all the sides in the competition are good, they would also like to do well, he said.         
	The Indian captain also felt regular matches with arch-rivals Pakistan had reduced the pressure on players that was associated with Indo-Pak games in the past. We are playing them a lot in the last four five years and that has helped reduce the pressure of playing them like it was in the past., Dhoni said.         
	He also said India would not be under extra pressure for the June 26 match with Pakistan. We will play it just like any other match. We have played a lot against them now and there is no extra pressure, the stumper said.         
	Dhoni indicated that he would promote himself in the batting order to avoid a middle-order collapse and try to maintain a scoring rate of over five runs in the middle overs.         
	The India skipper disagreed with the suggestion that the Indian Premier League had devalued Tests and one-day Internationals and reduced interest in the Asia Cup. (PTI)

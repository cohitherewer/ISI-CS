The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB: Time is running out on India tour
                                                                                                                                                                                                     PCB: Time is running out on India tour
                      
	Karachi: With only 18 days to go before Team Indias scheduled arrival in the country, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), who are still waiting for a final decision by their Indian counterpart, on Tuesday said they are running out of time for making security arrangements for the series.         
	Time is running out fast and it will be difficult for us to make security and logistical arrangements at short notice. We are still waiting for a final answer from the Indian board.         
	Until the Indians dont give an official answer, we cant say anything or plan ahead. But our priority remains for the series to be held in Pakistan or at other venues, a senior PCB official said.         
	Saleem Altaf, the chief operating officer of the board, however, was upbeat with the statement of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) that they would not hesitate to send their team to Pakistan if India cancel their tour.         
	Sri Lanka is free after mid-January and there is a window of opportunity available to us. If India does not come we definitely will consider inviting Sri Lanka for a series, he said.         
	Our main purpose is to have international commitments for our players and if Sri Lanka is willing we can have talks with them to offset any cancellation by India, Altaf added.         
	Altaf also said the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) was due to meet on December 27 and possibility of the tour could be discussed there with SLC president Arjuna Ranatunga.         
	Chances of India touring Pakistan are hanging on balance on the backdrop of strained relation between the countries after the Mumbai terror attacks.         
	PCB sources said that Ranatunga has taken a sympathetic stand to Pakistans position and has been in touch with boards director general Javed Miandad.         
	Ranatunga wants more co-operation between Sri Lanka and Pakistan cricket boards at all levels, one source said.           (PTI)

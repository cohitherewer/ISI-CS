                                                    Liverpool hopes all but dashed

         Liverpools Fernando Torres jumps for the ball at Anfield on Wednesday 
          
	London: Liverpools Premier League title aspirations all but vanished on Wednesday with a 1-1 home draw against relegation-threatened Wigan Athletic which left them languishing 12 points behind leaders Arsenal. 
    
	Rafael Benitezs side were booed off the field at Anfield after Wigan defender Titus Bramble fired a late equaliser to cancel out a classy opener from Fernando Torres. 
    
	Liverpool have now dropped out of the Premier Leagues top four, Sven-Goran Erikssons Manchester City rising above them after a 2-0 victory at troubled Newcastle United. 
    
	Brazilian Elano opened the scoring for City shortly before the interval and not even the second-half introduction of Michael Owen could inspire the Magpies as City doubled their lead through Fernandes Gelson. 
    
	City are fourth with 39 points, one more than Liverpool who have played a game fewer. Arsenal, who beat West Ham United 2-0 on Tuesday, are top with 50 points, two ahead of champions Manchester United. 
    
	Wigans surprise draw lifts them out of the bottom three where they are replaced by Sunderland who were beaten 0-1 at Blackburn Rovers. Dwight Yorke was sent off for Sunderland. 
    
	With Torres playing as a lone striker Liverpool huffed and puffed until the Spaniard started and finished a sweet move involving Steven Gerrard after 49 minutes for his 16th goal of the season. 
    
	Liverpool had chances to wrap up the points but an uncharacteristic mistake from Gerrard gave Wigan their first point against one of Englands so-called big four. His weak clearance fell straight at the feet of Bramble and the burly defender smashed the ball past Pepe Reina to leave Anfield in stunned silence. 
    
	In Spain, late goals from Ernesto Chevanton and Frederic Kanoute gave holders Sevilla a place in the last 16 of the Kings Cup on Wednesday with a 4-3 win over third division Denia. 
    
	League leaders Real Madrid also left it late to seal their place in the next round, a superbly taken strike by midfielder Guti earning the Spanish champions a 2-1 win at home to third division Alicante. (Reuters)

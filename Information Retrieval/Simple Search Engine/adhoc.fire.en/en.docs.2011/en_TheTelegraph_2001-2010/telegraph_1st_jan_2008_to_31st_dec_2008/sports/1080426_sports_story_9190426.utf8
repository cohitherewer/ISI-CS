The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara steers Kings XI to first win
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sangakkara steers Kings XI to first win
                      
	Mohali: Kumar Sangakkaras confident 94-run knock coupled with disciplined bowling fashioned Kings XI Punjabs 66-run victory over Mumbai Indians in their Indian Premier League match on Friday.         
	Sangakkara missed out on a well-deserved century but propelled his team to a competitive 182, after being sent to bat by the rival skipper.         
	The hosts then restricted their opponents to 116 for nine in their quota of 20 overs with Chawla coming up with a brilliant four-over spell, in which he claimed two wickets and conceded just 16 runs.         
	Brett Lee also produced exceptional figures of 4-0-9-1 while Irfan chipped in with two wickets in his teams first victory in the tournament.         
	Mumbai Indians run chase was far from ideal with both the openers making an early exit courtesy Lee.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England drop Hoggard, Harmison for 2nd Test
                                                     England drop Hoggard, Harmison for 2nd Test

	Wellington: England have gambled by dropping experienced pace bowlers Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard for the second Test against New Zealand starting on Thursday.         
	The tourists have included Stuart Broad, who has played just one Test, and James Anderson for the game at Wellingtons Basin Reserve in the two changes from the side beaten by 189 runs in the first match.         
	I think its a great opportunity for Jimmy (Anderson) and Broady to come in and establish themselves at this level, England captain Michael Vaughan told reporters.         
	I also hope that Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison really fight and try to get their places back because that will create a competitive environment.         
	The 29-year-old Harmison has struggled with injuries and loss of form since reaching the top of the world Test rankings in 2004.         
	He has taken 212 wickets in 57 Tests at an average of 31.39. Hoggard, 31, has claimed 248 Test wickets in 67 matches at 30.50.         
	The pair however, took just two wickets in the first Test at Seddon Park and conceded 278 runs.         
	It was a real hard decision but when youre in positions we are you have to make those decisions, said Vaughan.         
	Wellington pace bowler Mark Gillespie has replaced provincial teammate Jeetan Patel in the New Zealand side. He is the only change to the side that beat England by 189 runs in the first test in Hamilton.         
	Gillespie is likely to occupy the third seamer role for the match on a green-tinged Basin Reserve strip behind new-ball pair Kyle Mills and Chris Martin.         
	The match will be Gillespies second, and first on home soil. His other Test outing was against South Africa in the second Test loss at Centurion in November where he had match figures of five for 136.         
	THE SQUADS         
	England: Michael Vaughan (captain), Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Tim Ambrose, Ryan Sidebottom, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Monty Panesar.         
	New Zealand (likely): Daniel Vettori (captain), Jamie How, Matthew Bell, Stephen Fleming, Ross Taylor, Mathew Sinclair, Jacob Oram, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Mark Gillespie, Chris Martin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bad day in office: India captain
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bad day in office: India captain
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff celebrate the dismissal of Sachin Tendulkar (centre) at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday                           
	Chennai: Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not wish to read much into Indias dismal batting performance on the second day of the first Test. Its just a bad day in office, the Indian captain said.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If the Indians are complacent about off-spinners After Jason Krejza in the last Test, Graeme Swann has also come good in his maiden Test         
	We are not complacent. You are bound to get good players in international cricket. You are bound to go through such spells in which people will be bowling in the right areas. It happens In that game (Nagpur) we scored some 300 runs off Krejza. So it does not really matter even if you give 10 or 12 wickets to the bowler.         
	Rahul Dravids poor run         
	It happens with everyone. If you have such a long career there will be patches when you wont be doing really well. There will also be patches when you are at your peak, when you go in and get that big hundred that always takes the team through. It happens with great players and its nothing to worry about.         
	If the transition from one-day to Test mode has been tough         
	That is one area where we can say we did not get enough time. Before the Australia series we had a long 15 day camp, but that is part and parcel of life. We had a bad day in office and England bowled really well and in the right areas. The credit goes to them for creating pressure with the new ball. They were bowling just short of good length and getting good bounce.  
	 The reasons for not taking the second new ball during the England innings  
	It was reverse swinging at that time and you can say we were really prepared for it. We had the plan and I am quite happy with the way we bowled. In Test matches you can see whenever the new ball is taken runs are scored. The fast bowlers were also a bit tired. The conditions were not such that the ball would swing or seam around if you had taken the new ball.         
	Graeme Swanns spell         
	Swann bowled well. If you notice the balls with which he has taken the wickets, Rahul Dravid and Gautam Gambhir, just before tea... Gautam got one that was going in to the stumps, and Rahul too got a really good ball. You are bound to get wickets if you consistently bowl in the right areas.         
	Virender Sehwag failing to get going         
	Not really worrying. If you see, the opening partnership is really important when it comes to Test cricket. The kind of cricket he plays, he looks to dominate. That is his strategy, game plan and strength and he has scored lots of runs with that.         
	The target on the third morning         
	Practically speaking, we will look to score 250 when we come here tomorrow with the lower order. It will be tough. It is not like that we have lost the game. Yes we are in a difficult position and England have the upper hand right now.         
	The collapse         
	Well, at times when you play shots it does not really pay off. We have also seen the bowlers bowling well. If you are playing shots you are bound to get out, and we are not really bothered about it. Today it was that case of England bowling really well.         
	England reaching 316 despite Flintoffs early dismissal         
	Frankly speaking I am quite happy with that total because they were nearly 230 when we started the day. It is not only about Freddie. Whoever comes out to bat  Anderson or Harmison  are bound to score runs and especially when you have an attacking field, the opposition is bound to get a boundary if you bowl a bad ball or if you dont put the ball in the right area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modi shrugs off SRK controversy
                                                   Modi shrugs off SRK controversy
                      
	New Delhi: Indian Premier League commissioner Lalit Modi set aside the controversy that he helped Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan hours before the start of the players bidding.         
	In the dead of night on Tuesday, Modi visited Shahrukh and courted controversy for helping Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd, the IPL franchisee owned by the actor.         
	Modi said he showed no favouritism and tried to help other franchisees as well.         
	I have been accused of helping someone in the bidding process by some news channels. I didnt only visit Shahrukh Khan, I was with four teams owners at night. I was with Mohali before that, I was with Jaipur, I was with UB team. Its my job to explain them the process and explain them how to go for the bidding, Modi said.         
	Modi said players would be the ultimate gainers. Money is good for the game... More money means more stars, more enjoyment for the people.

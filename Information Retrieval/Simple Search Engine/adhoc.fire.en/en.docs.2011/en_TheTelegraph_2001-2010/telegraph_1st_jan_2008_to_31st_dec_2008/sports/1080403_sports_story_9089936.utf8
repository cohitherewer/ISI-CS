                                                   Invitation to Asian trio irks Monty 
                            
	London: Colin Montgomerie, seething at missing out on a Masters appearance for only the second time in his career, has lashed out at the organisers for ignoring him and inviting an Asian trio, including Jeev Milkha Singh, all ranked lower than him to the tournament.         
	Montgomerie said that had he been Chinese, he would have been part of the first major of the season next week but instead, he will now be at home washing his car. There has been no call from Augusta and I am not expecting one, he said.         
	The Scot is not among the top 50 and has slid to 75 in the world rankings, failing to make the cut for the major. But he was angered when Jeev (world No. 80), Prayad Marksaeng of Thailand (93) and Liang Wen-Hong of China (111) received special invitations. Now, if I were the only person in the country, a la China, I might get in. It is a strange way to make up a field for a major championships television rights, he was quoted as saying by a British daily.         
	When I missed out last time in 2005 they picked Shingo Katayama who was 67th in the world and I was 51st. They picked him over me for the Japanese rights. And they have done the same with Thailand and China this time, he said on the sidelines of a promotional for Junes BMW International Open.         
	Jeev, meanwhile had been grouped with Englishman Kenneth Ferrie and American Cody Freeman for the first two rounds of the $5.6 million Houston Open. (PTI)

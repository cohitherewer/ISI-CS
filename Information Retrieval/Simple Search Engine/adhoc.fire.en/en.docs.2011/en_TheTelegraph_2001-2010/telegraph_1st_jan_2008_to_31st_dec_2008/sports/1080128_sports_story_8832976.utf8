                                                Pak seal series
                      
	Multan: Allrounder Shahid Afridi blasted a flamboyant 85 to power Pakistan to a 37-run victory and an unassailable 3-0 series lead against Zimbabwe on Sunday.         
	Pakistan restricted Zimbabwe to 235 for seven after Afridi smashed 85 from 52 balls to lead his side to 272 for nine in the third one-day International of the five match series.         
	Zimbabwe left Pakistan reeling at 78 for five before Afridi lit up the Multan Stadium with his explosive hitting.         
	The visitors looked like they could be on course for a rare victory when Sean Williams (71) and Brendan Taylor (55) batted fluently to add 105 runs for the fourth wicket but their innings fell away after the enterprising stand was broken by captain Shoaib Malik.         
	Taylor was stumped by Kamran Akmal in the 36th over, beaten in flight by Maliks off spin after notching up his 12th half-century.         
	Earlier, Pakistans decision to bat first on a flat track appeared to be backfiring before Afridi tore into the visitors attack.         
	Afridi equalled Sanath Jayasuriyas world record for most sixes (392) in the one-day game with his sixth and final six as he put on 116 runs for the sixth wicket with Misbah-ul-Haq (44).         
	Tawanda Mupariwa returned his best figures of four for 46 in his first match of the series.         
	Pakistan looked in danger of slumping badly when they lost four wickets in seven overs, while adding just 12 runs.           (REUTERS)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Gagan Narang                           
	New Delhi: Gagan Narang once again displayed his class when he set a world record to win the 10-metre air rifle event in the season ending World Cup Finals in Bangkok on Wednesday.         
	The tournament is considered to be the most prestigious event in the ISSF calendar. Narang was the lone invitee among the Indian shooters. Olympic gold medalist Abhinav Bindra was also invited but he chose not to participate in the tournament.         
	The meet had a strong field, comprising Beijing Olympics medalists like Chinese Zhu Qinan of China and Henn Hakkinen of Finland.         
	This is the second time Narang has won a gold in a world event. In the World Cup in China in 2006, the Hyderabad based shooter won the gold in the air rifle event. Narang, who failed to win a medal in the Beijing Olympics, scored a total of 703.5  a perfect 600 in the qualifying and 103.5 in the final  to break Austrias Farnik Thomas record set in 2006 World Cup in Granada, Spain.         
	Matthew Emmons of the US, with a score of 702.5 (598+104.5), bagged the silver while the bronze went to Zhu Qinan, who shot 702.3 (599+103.3).         
	I let my gun do the talking, said a proud Narang from Bangkok. I equalled one record and broke another. Its like having two golden geese in the basket, he said.         
	Narang never had to look back after he struck 600 out of 600 points in the qualifying rounds. He was in the lead all through the 10-shot final and shot 10.3 to finish with the gold medal.         
	Narang said this victory was special for him as it came after his disappointing performance in the Beijing Olympics.         
	I was confident of making a comeback, Narang said. Shooting is a learning experience. Some we win and some we lose.

	Brussels: Juventus had to fight back for a 2-2 draw at BATE Borisov in their Group H match in the Uefa Champions League on Tuesday.

	It was the second time a Serie A side suffered a shock result this season in European soccers top competition after Romanian debutants CFR Cluj defeated AS Roma in their opening match a fortnight ago. Cluj face Chelsea on Wednesday.         
	They surprised us. We couldnt hold them in any area of the field. It was a nightmare first half hour, Juve coach Claudio Ranieri said.         
	We did well not to give up. We have to compliment these lads from Belarus. They ran like there were 22 of them, not 11.         
	Iaquinta showered praise on winger Sebastian Giovinco for his display. To have him on the field changes things a lot, Iaquinta told reporters. He puts some great balls in the middle which we attackers need. He is also a great player.

	Real, who went ahead with a fourth-minute own goal by Tomas Hubocan before Portugals Danny equalised, lead the group on six points after two games. Juventus are second with four points, BATE have one and Zenit none.         
	In Group G action Arsenal trounced Porto while the other group match between Fenerbahce and Dynamo Kiev ended scoreless. Arsenal have four points from two games, one point more than Porto. Dynamo have two points and Fenerbahce one.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Anand loses final to Ivanchuk
                      
	Leon: Indian GM Viswanathan Anand paid for costly blunders at crucial junctures to lose a closely-fought final and relinquish the Magistral Ciudad De Leon chess crown to Vassily Ivanchuk here.         
	Ukrainian GM Ivanchuk, fresh from his triumph in the Mtel Masters, scored a 2.51.5 victory to deny the Indian his eighth title here.         
	The first game set the tone of the match as Ivanchuk took the lead over the world champion with black pieces.         
	Anand bounced back in the second game with a thumping victory in 26 moves from the black side of the Sicilian Defence. Ivanchuk adopted a positional approach against the Sicilian Najdorf and Anand neutralised it easily with skilful play.         
	Ivanchuk was left without a concrete plan. (PTI)

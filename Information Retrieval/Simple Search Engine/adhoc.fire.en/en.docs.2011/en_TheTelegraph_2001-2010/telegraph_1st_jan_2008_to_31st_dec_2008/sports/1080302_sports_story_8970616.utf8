            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT                            
	Trainer Cooji Katraks prized filly, Oasis Star, carried the faith of her backers to an easy victory in the Deccan Bookmakers Association Sprinters Cup in Hyderabad on Saturday, the Day I of the two-day Invitation Cup racing festival. Jockey Y. Srinath had the Senure filly settled in third behind Lady One and Onnu Onnu Onnu till a 300m from home before cruising past the two leaders.          
	The Stayers Cup, in contrast, went to the less-fancied, Arabian Knight (S.Fargeat-up), a Jaggy Dhariwal-trainee who made every post of the 3000m trip a winning one.

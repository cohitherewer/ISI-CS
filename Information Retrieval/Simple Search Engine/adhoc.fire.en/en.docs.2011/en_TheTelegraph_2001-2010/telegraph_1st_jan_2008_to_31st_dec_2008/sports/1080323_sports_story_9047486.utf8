The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen saves England blushes
                                                     Pietersen saves England blushes
                  Kevin Pietersen in action on Saturday                     
	Napier: A century by Kevin Pietersen saved face for England as teenage debutant Tim Southee gave New Zealand the upper hand on Day I of the deciding third Test here on Saturday.         
	Pietersens timely return to form with a solid 129 was the only firm resistance by England, who struggled to 240 for seven at stumps.         
	Stuart Broad was not out 42, his highest Test score, with Ryan Sidebottom on three.         
	England captain Michael Vaughan had no hesitation in batting first winning the toss with the wicket showing all the hallmarks of a batting gem.         
	But the game was less than four overs old when the 19-year-old Southee ignited the collapse of the England top order.         
	He dismissed Vaughan and Andrew Strauss early in the day and then came back before stumps with the second new ball to end Pietersens resolute knock.         
	England were three down for just four runs and then four for 36 before Pietersen set about saving the side from total capitulation.         
	But despite Pietersens heroics and the late resistance from Broad, New Zealand took overall honours on the first day of this final Test with both sides keen to break the 1-1 series deadlock rather than play for a draw.

	Melbourne: Roger Federers wizardry entranced Australian Open crowds on Thursday and the passion of Marat Safin illuminated the night session but only the Swiss stayed in the hunt for the title. 
    
	Federers sleight of hand totally bamboozled court magician Fabrice Santoro and the top seed produced a Centre Court master class to reach round three with a 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 win. 
    
	Where Federer was sublime, Safin was savage. 
    
	The Russian, champion here in 2005, bludgeoned his way back from two sets down before succumbing4-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 2-6 to 15th-seeded Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis. 
    
	With Federer and Safin acting as the main course, the side dishes were no less appetising. 
    
	Ana Ivanovic wowed the Centre Court crowd, Venus Williams cruised, Novak Djokovic was on automatic pilot and Lleyton Hewitt thrilled the home crowd. 
    
	Safin came close but blew too hot-and-cold to get past as accomplished a player as Baghdatis. The 2006 runner-up, Baghdatis rattled off the opening two sets. 
    
	The Russian ripped through sets three and four, though, before Baghdatis broke in the second game of the final set and again in the eighth to set up a third-round clash with Hewitt. 
    
	Hes Australian, isnt he? the Cypriot said, smiling at the crowd when questioned about the match-up. 
    
	Third seed Djokovic crushed Italian Simone Bolelli 6-1, 6-2, 6-2; Hewitt kept the home fans happy with a 7-6, 6-3, 5-7, 6-1 win over Uzbek Denis Istomin and fifth seed David Ferrer was 6-3, 6-4 up on Juan Martin del Potro when the Argentine retired. 
    
	Ivanovic underlined that she is much more than the pin-up of the womens Tour by smashing world No. 40 Tathiana Garbin 6-0, 6-3. 
    
	Earlier in the day, Wimbledon champion Venus hit back from behind in both sets before pricking Camille Pins hopes 7-5, 6-4. Second seed Svetlana Kuznetsova, however, was far from convincing in her 7-6, 6-2 victory over Bulgarias Tsvetana Pironkova.

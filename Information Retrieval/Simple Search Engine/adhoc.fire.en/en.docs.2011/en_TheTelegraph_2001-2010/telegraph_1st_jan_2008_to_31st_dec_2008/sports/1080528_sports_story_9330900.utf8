Yannick son arrested  Gainesville (US): Chicago Bulls forward Joakim Noah, son of former French Open champion Yannick Noah, has been charged with possession of marijuana and having an open container of alcohol. Joakim could face up to 6 months in jail and a $500 fine for the marijuana charge.   Yannick defended his son, saying on Tuesday at the French Open: ldquo;I don rsquo;t understand all that fuss for just drinking a beer on the street rdquo;.  Terry to lead   London: John Terry will captain England in their friendly against the United States. England coach Fabio Capello made the announcement on Tuesday, a day before the match at Wembley.  England play Trinidad amp; Tobago next Sunday and Czech Republic in August in preparation for the start of the 2010 World Cup qualifiers in September. They did not qualify for Euro 2008.  Wednesday rsquo;s match will also be significant striker Landon Donovan, who is poised to make his 100th appearance for the US.  Jose Inter deal  London: According to reports in Portugal, former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will take over from Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan within the next 48 hours, says The Daily Telegraph. The move could prompt Frank Lampard to follow him to Inter.  Lampard is due to continue talks with Chelsea but if Inter confirm Mourinho as successor to Roberto Mancini, he could be persuaded to move. The fact that Chelsea are without a manager will not help in holding on to Lampard, who was said to be close to moving to Inter in a four-year deal last week. Mourinho is understood to have agreed to a three-year contract worth pound;7 million per annum.  UAE to host   Sydney: The UAE beat bids from Australia and Japan to host the 2009 and 2010 editions of the Club World Cup soccer meet. Fifa president Sepp Blatter told a news conference on Tuesday that travel times counted against the Australian bid and that the world body wanted a short change from Japan, making the UAE the best option.

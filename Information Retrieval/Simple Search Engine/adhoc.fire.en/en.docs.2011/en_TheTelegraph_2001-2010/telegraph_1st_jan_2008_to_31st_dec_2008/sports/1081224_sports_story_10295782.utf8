            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Coach Utpal Chatterjee on Tuesday raised a storm by questioning the inclusion of Sreevats Goswami in the Bengal squad for the Ranji Trophy quarter final against Tamil Nadu in Bangalore.         
	Sreevats was dropped from the squad for Bengals matches against Tripura, Vidarbha and Goa.         
	Utpal was not called for the selection committee meeting on Monday and the CAB admitted it to be a lapse on their part.         
	Ive got used to this Some things dont change. All I can say is that I felt insulted, the coach said.

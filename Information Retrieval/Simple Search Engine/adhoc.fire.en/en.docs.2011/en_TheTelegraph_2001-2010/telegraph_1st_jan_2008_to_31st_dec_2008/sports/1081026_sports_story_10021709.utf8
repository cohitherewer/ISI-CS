The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan fail to overpower 10-man East Bengal
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bagan fail to overpower 10-man East Bengal
  - I-League city derby ends in draw; churchill up to second spot       A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia after scoring at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan and East Bengal shared a point apiece as Saturdays crucial derby of the ONGC I-League ended at 1-1 at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	The result compounds the Big Twos miseries, particularly Bagans, who are struggling to keep pace with three points from five matches. East Bengal are mid-table, managing seven points.         
	Sangram Mukherjees absence from the starting XI and Lalkamal Bhowmicks inclusion in the wide right position were the only surprises in Karim Bencharifas choice of ammunition. As expected, Jayanta Sen started ahead of Mehrajuddin Wadoo in the heart of the East Bengal midfield.         
	The usual cagey start associated with big ties wasnt to be seen this time round as Mohun Bagan went ahead in the very first minute.         
	Man of the Match Ishfaq Ahmed, who did a Forrest Gump running his socks off down the flanks, fed Bhaichung Bhutia inside the box.         
	Bhaichung brought the ball down and burst into the space left between Suley Musah and M. Suresh. His subsequent shot was on target and surprisingly eluded Subrata Pauls grasp. Bagan were one up, with Pauls invincible tag suddenly sounding embarrassing.         
	The desire to win from both sides was reflected in the hard tackles and endless running in the middle third.         
	As the game proceeded, Rakesh Masih, who started after shaking off a hamstring injury, stamped his authority in the midfield as Jayanta Sen and Chhangte Malsawmkima looked largely clueless. The flair and composure expected from Bagans much touted foreign recruit Marcos Perreira, was absent.         
	East Bengal equalised and sent Stanley Rozario dancing (momentarily of course) in the technical area, as Syed Rahim Nabi struck in the 38th minute. Marcos lost the ball in his own half, muscled out by Jayanta and Nabi.         
	Nabi then released Yakubu down the right, who, after a quick stepover, sent a precise through for Nabi, who, meanwhile, had given Habibur Rahaman and Peter Odafe the slip. Nabi opened up his body ever so slightly and slipped it in past Shilton.         
	Rozarios men could have gone into the break 2-1 up, had Sunil Chhetris effort from close range not been saved by Shilton.         
	The second period started with a moment of madness from Surkumar. The right back picked up a straight red card after kicking out at Rakesh Masih and subsequently pushing down Bhaichung.         
	East Bengal relied on counter attacks led by the effervescent Yakubu. In the 78th minute he first beat the hapless Anand Vasan and then dodged past Deepak Mondal, leaving himon the floor. The move though fizzled out as Yakubus pass to substitute Sanju Pradhan was wasted.         
	As the two sets of fans went home happy at not having lost to their archrivals, news streamed in that over in Goa, Churchill Brothers moved up to the second spot in the I-League thrashing Vasco. Pride and prestige were intact on a rainy evening, whos worried about the top half of the league anyway.

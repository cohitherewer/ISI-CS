	Southport: Twice former champion Greg Norman, who plays more tennis than golf at the age of 53, spectacularly stole the limelight from the games best players in Thursdays opening round at the British Open.         
	The former world number one, the second-oldest player in the 153-strong field, fired a level-par 70 to end a gruelling day one stroke off the pace at a wet, wind-buffeted Royal Birkdale.         
	US Open runner-up Rocco Mediate seized control with a 69 before being joined at the top of the leaderboard by Scottish Open champion Graeme McDowell and Australian Robert Allenby.         
	Despite having missed three cuts in his five appearances worldwide this year, Norman moved into contention with a patient display of links-course golf.         
	British Open champion at Turnberry in 1986 and Royal St Georges in 1993, the veteran Australian shared fourth place with compatriot Adam Scott and American Bart Bryant.         
	I dont play much (golf) and I dont practice much, Norman told reporters after taking advantage of easing afternoon conditions. I probably practice more tennis than golf but at the same time theres something about this event that stimulates you.         
	When I came over here I played two pretty good practice rounds. I hit the ball solid. I played almost identical the first three rounds of golf I played here.         
	But Norman, who has won 78 tournaments in 13 countries, did not want to get carried away.         
	Ive got to keep my expectations realistically low, added the Australian, who married former tennis great Chris Evert in the Bahamas 19 days ago.         
	There are a lot of great players in contention and Ive just got to take it one shot at a time and see what happens.         
	Mediate, who narrowly failed to pull off a stunning playoff victory over Tiger Woods at last months US Open, briefly set the pace on his own after covering the back nine in three under.         
	Northern Irishman McDowell, a double winner on the 2008 European Tour, and Allenby then birdied the last two holes to join the American atop the leaderboard.         
	Former major winners Retief Goosen and Mike Weir carded 71s after defying atrocious weather in the morning, ending a bruising day two strokes off the lead.         
	Nineteen players failed to break 80 on a day when the scoring average was just under 76.         
	Mediate, a four-time winner on the PGA Tour, conceded he and his fellow leaders had benefited from afternoon tee-offs.         
	Agreed the guys in the morning got it worse because it was much easier without the rain but you still had to get it done, the 45-year-old said after taking only 21 putts.         
	It was fun, it was insane and great to finish like I did. It was a great putting round. I made everything.         
	Mediate chipped in at the 17th and holed a 20-footer at the last.         
	McDowell, who led after the opening round of the 2006 British Open at Hoylake before dropping back into a tie for 61st, believes he is better equipped to stay in the hunt.         
	Padraig Harrington, beginning his title defence with a wrist injury, eked out a 74.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I doped before Sydney: Tim 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       I doped before Sydney: Tim 
                  Tim Montgomery                     
	New York: Disgraced former world record holder Tim Montgomery said he took testosterone and human growth hormone before the Sydney Olympics, and does not deserve the gold medal he won in the 400m relay.         
	The admission was made during an interview scheduled to be aired on HBO television on Tuesday.         
	I have a gold medal that Im sitting on that I didnt get with my own ability, Montgomery said in the interview. Im not here to take away from anybody elses accomplishments, only my own. And I must say, I apologise to the others who were on the relay team if that was to happen.         
	Montgomery never tested positive for drugs, but he was banned from track for two years and his world record in the 100m was erased after he was linked to the Balco doping investigation. He retired after the ban was imposed in 2005.         
	He did not say in the interview when or how often he had taken testosterone, just that he had done so before Sydney. He also said he took HGH four times a month.         
	If Tim cheated at the Games, then he should voluntarily return his medal, just as others from the 2000 team have done, Darryl Seibel, spokesman for the US Olympic Committee, said. By using a banned substance, any result he achieved is tainted.         
	He has a responsibility to his sport, to the athletes against whom he competed in Sydney and also to the new generation of track athletes           (AP)

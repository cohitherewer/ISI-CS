The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICCs tough stand on slow over-rates
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ICCs tough stand on slow over-rates
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has decided to crack the whip on teams which maintain slow over-rates in Tests and one-dayers besides also proposing more stringent punishment to players guilty of verbal abuse.         
	The chief executives committee (CEC), at the end of its two-day meeting in Cape Town, dealt at length on the slow over-rate problem and verbal abuse of opposition players, two issues which affected the recent series between India and Australia.         
	Members of the CEC called for stronger action against teams bowling their overs too slowly in Tests and ODIs. As a result, ICC management will review the relevant regulations with a view to encouraging better over-rates and strengthening sanctions against offending teams, an ICC statement said.         
	All recommendations made in the two-day meeting will still have to be approved by the full ICC executive when it meets in January. These will include a proposed expansion of the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit to take in the wider brief of safety, security and terrorist intelligence, in the wake of the recent attacks in Islamabad and Mumbai.         
	There was no mention of the wider implications of the Twenty20 boom, in particular the two hottest topics, the IPL and ICL. With the current FTP due to conclude in May 2012, the CEC also spent time discussing the concept of an alternative structure to bilateral tours, including the possibility of an enhanced Test championship.         
	The following are the other important decisions taken:         
	 The CEC also agreed to draw up an anti-racism code separate from the ICC Code of Conduct. A draft code will be drawn up after receiving written comments and suggestions from members.         
	 The CEC was updated on the situation regarding proposed amendments to the Code of Conduct, specifically to do with Levels 3 and 4 charges being referred to an independent legally qualified adjudicator.         
	 The CEC recommended to the ICC board that the role of the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) be expanded to include liaising and managing safety, security and terrorism intelligence matters with independent security consultants/agencies and advising the ICC chief executive and Board on all matters relating to safety and security. This would be primarily for ICC events but it is envisaged that the ACSU would be prepared to offer this service to members for bilateral series if asked to do so.         
	 All full members and the top six associate members also agreed to have in place WADA-compliant codes by July 1, 2009. CEC agreed that draft copies of each members anti-doping code must be with the ICC by March 1, 2009 to allow for any necessary amendments to be made by the required deadline.         
	 Due to scheduling issues, the CEC was not in favour of the inclusion of cricket in the programme for the Commonwealth Games 2014 to take place in Glasgow.         
	 ICC CEO Haroon Lorgat emphasised on the need of member countries working closely to overcome the problems which cropped up from time to time.         
	 A team of the tournament will be selected from the Womens World Cup in 2009 and at the annual ICC Awards, the Womens Cricketer of the Year be selected using the same voting process as for the men.

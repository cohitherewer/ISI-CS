The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stuart Clark finds himself isolated
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Stuart Clark finds himself isolated
                      
	Hyderabad: Pacer Stuart Clark finds himself isolated in the Australian cricket team after his fellow players, including skipper Ricky Ponting, Tuesday denied having any apprehensions about playing in Delhi following the recent blasts.         
	Clark told the Australian media that the recent blasts had left the players jittery about playing the third Test in Delhi but his teammates said they had full faith in Cricket Australia (CA) and the security cover provided to them was also quite reassuring.         
	Captain Ricky Ponting distanced himself from Clark and said, I dont think his comments reflect the view of the team.         
	We are keeping an eye on the scenario and are in constant touch with security people to know what they think of the situation. They are comfortable with the security provided to us and we are comfortable too. I must say we are happy with the arrangements, he added.         
	Vice-captain Michael Clarke also ruled out any such apprehensions and said: We have a security expert with us and he is doing his job. The team has full faith in our cricket board and the Australian Cricketers Association and we know they are taking the right decisions.         
	Pace spearhead Brett Lee too looked equally relaxed and convinced that organisers had put in place a foolproof system for the visitors.         
	They have put in place a comprehensive security system and we are going by the judgement of the security experts. I dont think there is anything to worry, Lee said.         
	Senior batsman Matthew Hayden was also satisfied with arrangements and said, Im very confident that they have put enough security in place and it would be the same for the remainder of the tour.         
	Opener Phil Jaques, however, felt it is only natural to have concerns after a blast but said he was not worried.

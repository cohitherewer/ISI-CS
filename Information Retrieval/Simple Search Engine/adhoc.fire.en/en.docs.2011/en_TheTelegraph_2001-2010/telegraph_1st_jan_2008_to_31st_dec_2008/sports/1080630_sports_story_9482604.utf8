	Paris: Shiv Kapur brought home his worst card of the tourney so far, a five-over 76, to slump to tied 43rd after the penultimate round of the Open de France Alstom here.         
	Kapur has a total of one-over 214. Among the other Indians in fray, Jeev Milkha Singh (212) moved up one rung to tied 27th after returning a one-under 70, while Jyoti Randhawa (225) continued his downward curve, tumbling further down to tied 68th after carding a 10-over 81.         
	Kapur, who carded a sensational eight-under 63 in the second round, had a nightmarish third round as he bogeyed the fifth and ninth before stumbling to a double bogey at the par-four 12th, which saw him slip from his overnight tied eighth position.

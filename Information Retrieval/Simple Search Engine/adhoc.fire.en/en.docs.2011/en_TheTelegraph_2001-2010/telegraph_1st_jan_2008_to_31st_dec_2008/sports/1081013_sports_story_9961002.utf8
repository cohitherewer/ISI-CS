	ICC chief condemns IPL-SLC deal  London: International Cricket Council (ICC) president David Morgan has condemned the $40 million deal between Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and Indian Premier League (IPL) which would entail cancellation of Lankan Test tour to England, terming it unacceptable in the light of earlier agreements between the ECB and the SLC.  A five-member SLC delegation is travelling to India next week to finalise the deal after the Sri Lanka sports minister Gamini Lokuge has given the go ahead.  Under the deal, the SLC will release 12 players for the IPL which in turn would pay $40 million to cash-strapped SLC as guarantee money it will forfeit due to cancellation of the two-Test series in England scheduled from April 21 to May 30. The second edition of the IPL is scheduled for April 10-May 25 next year.

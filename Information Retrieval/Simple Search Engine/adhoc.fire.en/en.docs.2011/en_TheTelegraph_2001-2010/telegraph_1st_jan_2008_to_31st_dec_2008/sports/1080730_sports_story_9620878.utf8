The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No problems with touring India: CA
                                                                                                                                                                                                     No problems with touring India: CA
                      
	Melbourne: Blasts in India do not trigger the kind of security concerns that they do in Pakistans case, says Cricket Australia, while insisting that it cannot be accused of hypocrisy if it opts to play in India but refuses to tour Pakistan for the Champions Trophy.         
	Australia tour India in October and would be carrying out a security inspection in the country next month to assess the situation. CA spokesman Peter Young said it was a routine exercise and cited the example of the 2005 London bombings after which the Aussies did a security check before deciding to stay back for completing the Ashes series.         
	Besides the national team, two Australian doemstic teams  Victoria and Western Australia  are also scheduled to tour India for the inaugural Twenty20 Champions League.         
	Victoria coach Greg Shipperd, who also coached Delhi Daredevils during the Indian Premier League, hoped that the situation would improve.         
	Meanwhile, Australian Cricketers Association chief executive Paul Marsh said the weekend bombings in Bangalore and Ahmedabad were a concern but ACA would continue to go through the security processes with Cricket Australia, as we always do.         
	Meanwhile, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is not losing sleep over the impending security inspection by an Australian delegation and is confident that the world champions October tour would go ahead as scheduled, a report adds from Chennai.

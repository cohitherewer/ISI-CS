The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo gets ice treatment on ankle
                                                                                                                                                                                           Ronaldo gets ice treatment on ankle
                      
	Neuchatel (Switzerland): Cristiano Ronaldo left Portugals first training session in Switzerland in preparation for the European Championship with ice wrapped around his right ankle on Monday.         
	The winger looked to be fine throughout the session but before he returned to the dressing room, doctors taped the ice around his foot.         
	He was not limping and did not appear to be in pain, but the Portuguese medical team didnt immediately explain what had happened.         
	Portugal underwent a light training session a day after arriving in the lakeside town of Neuchatel for their final week of preparation before Saturdays start of the tournament.         
	The players trained and did a few drills before a short session with the ball at La Maladiere Stadium.         
	Tuesdays practice was expected to be open to fans and tickets have been sold-out for days.         
	Newly signed Chelsea defender Jose Bosingwa practiced separately from teammates, running around the field and doing specific drills with a trainer.         
	Portugal, the Euro 2004 finalists, plays their first match of this edition on Saturday against Turkey in Geneva. Hosts Switzerland and the Czech Republic are the other two teams in group A.         
	About 5,000 fans greeted players and coaches when they arrived from Portugal on Sunday night, waving Portuguese flags and chanting loudly.         
	We knew we would be welcomed in here, but this was beyond our expectations, Portuguese football federation president Gilberto Madail said.         
	What we saw was unforgettable, but now we must focus on the work we have ahead of our first game.         
	About 10,000 Portuguese fans went to Neuchatel to greet the squad on Sunday, city officials said.         
	Portugal will be based in Neuchatel at least until the semi-finals, if they progress that far.         
	Under Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, Portugal are coming off successful campaigns in recent top competitions.         
	After losing to Greece on home soil in the Euro 2004 final, Portugal reached the 2006 World Cup semi-finals, losing to France.         
	Portugal beat Georgia 2-0 on Saturday in Viseu in their final warm-up match.

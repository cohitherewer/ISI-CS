                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mendis:   Learnt to bowl with discipline
            A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Colombo: Man-of-the-Series Ajantha Mendis on Monday said he just wanted to bowl alongside the wily Muttiah Muralidharan in Tests.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	What did you learn from the series?         
	I learnt to bowl with discipline rather than attack much, when I am bowling against good batsmen. I kept the pressure going, so that has helped.         
	How did you manage bowling wicket to wicket?         
	That is something that I practised quite a bit, especially at training. (Jayawardene adds: If I may add, that is something we wanted him to do as well. He is much more dangerous when he bowls very straight).         
	Did you have any thoughts about breaking the world record before the series started?         
	None whatsoever. I just wanted to bowl with Murali and just to bowl well. In the first two Test matches when I picked up wickets, I got lot of confidence and then thought I might have the opportunity but never went after it. It just came along.         
	On bowling in ODIs         
	Will probably bowl well.

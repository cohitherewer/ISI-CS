                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bencharifa not losing hope
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: With the going getting tough already, stragglers Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting both seemed satisfied with the solitary point.         
	Shabbir Ali said, Its all in the game and a point is not bad. Counterpart Karim Bencharifa struck identical notes: I am satisfied that the players did their best It (the result) could have been worse.         
	Bencharifa regarded his sides first half display as a positive. We played the best first half in the I-League so far. In the first period both teams tried to create, play football and we emerged on top. The second half became more physical and Mohammedan Sporting won all the 50-50 balls.         
	Mohammedan coach Shabbir said his team missed a lot of chances in the second half, despite dominating. He also said, We didnt really get a break after the local league and we dont have a good bench strength.         
	Despite managing a couple of points thus far, the two men in charge were still hopeful about their teams progress up the standings. Shabbir quipped, The standard between the I-League and the Calcutta league is not very different and with the performance graphs of most teams going up and down, we still have a chance.         
	Bencharifa too reiterated that all is not lost yet. Everybody is losing and winning on alternate days! This still gives us hope and a chance. The Moroccan hoped that by round six or seven, the teams currently at the bottom end will start to force their way upwards.         
	He also stated that Mohun Bagan would welcome back the services of Bhaichung Bhutia and Habibur Rahaman for next weekends derby clash. Marcos Pereira will also be available.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney scores in United win
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rooney scores in United win
                  Arsenals Cesc Fabregas celebrates after scoring a last-minute goal in Sunderland on Saturday                     
	Blackburn: Wayne Rooney shook off an ankle injury to score the second goal in Manchester Uniteds 2-0 victory at Blackburn in the Premier League on Saturday.         
	Cesc Fabregas headed an injury-time equaliser for Arsenal to draw 1-1 at Sunderland and remain behind Chelsea and Liverpool in the Premier League title race.         
	Rooney scored in the 64th minute after Wes Browns header had put defending champion United ahead in the 31st. He scored after Cristiano Ronaldo beat Rovers defender Martin Olsson, who slipped on the soaking Ewood Park surface, and pulled the ball back for Rooney.         
	Beaten at home by Hull City last week, the Gunners appeared to be heading for another loss when Grant Leadbitter headed home a corner for Sunderland in the 86th minute.         
	But Arsenals late pressure led to Fabregas scoring with a rare header in the third minute of injury time for only his second goal in 25 games.         
	The third-placed Gunners have 13 points from seven games after dropping five in their last two matches.         
	Arsenal had the ball in the net when Robin van Persie turned home a cross from Theo Walcott, but the linesman flagged incorrectly that the ball had gone out of play.         
	Roman Bednar turned in a corner by Jonathan Greening in the 61st minute for West Broms winner against Fulham. West Broms second Premier League victory in a row sent Tony Mowbrays team up to seventh place.         
	Jeremie Aliadiere scored at Wigan for Middlesbroughs first away win. Birmingham went top of the League Championship with a 1-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers after Wolves lost 3-1 at Swansea.

	New Delhi: Ace driver Narain Karthikeyan, who steered Team India to the top spot in the A1 GP Grid in China and England last year, is now aiming for a top six finish in the circuit.         
	Speaking during a function to announce the launch of the Ferrari-powered cars for A1 Team India, Karthikeyan said: Last year, we were one of the four teams in the circuit to win more than one race.         
	Now our aim is to win more races. We need to do that to finish among the top six. Given the kind of talent our team has, it is not an impossible task, said Karthikeyan, who once honed his racing skills at the Winfield Racing School in France.         
	Karthikeyan, who became the first Indian Formula One driver when he joined Team Jordan in 2005, believes that his experience in the F1 circuit would stand him in good stead in the new season.         
	My experience in Formula One will help this time, he said confidently.         
	With the new car structure, I expect the car to be 5-6 seconds quicker this year.         
	I think the introduction of Ferrari engines and chassis will reduce the gap with Formula One and it would be almost akin to driving an F1 car, said the Team India driver.         
	Though its going to be an unknown territory for all the drivers, who are yet to see the new car, I know what to expect, said Karthikeyan after team India unveiled its new livery and rookie drivers Armaan Ebrahim and Parthiva Sureswaran.         
	We have to do well in the first three races. After that, there is a two-month break and others might catch up with us by that time, he added.         
	Armaan, who joined the team as the new rookie driver, said he was looking forward to make the most of the opportunity.         
	Representing the country is always a great honour and I am just thrilled to be in the A1 GP, he said.

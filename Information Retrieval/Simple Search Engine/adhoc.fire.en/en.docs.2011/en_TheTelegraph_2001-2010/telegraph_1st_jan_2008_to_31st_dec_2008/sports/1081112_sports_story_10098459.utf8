The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chappell calls for blueprint
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chappell calls for blueprint
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Greg Chappell                           
	Calcutta/Melbourne: Australias 0-2 series loss to India has created such shock ripples at home that former captain Greg Chappell has called for a watershed think-tank of cricket power brokers to ensure there is no repeat of Australias cricketing recession of the mid-1980s.         
	Chappell said a fresh blueprint needs to be chalked out to kick-start a new generation of Australian success.         
	The review in the mid-1980s, under chairman of selectors Lawrie Sawle, identified Steve Waugh, Ian Healy, Dean Jones and Geoff Marsh who led the teams revival.         
	It followed the retirement of Rod Marsh, Dennis Lillee and Chappell. Australia is now again struggling without Shane Warne, Adam Gilchrist and Glenn McGrath, and they suffered a humiliating 0-2 loss to India. We need to sit down as we did 20-odd years ago and look at the types of cricketers we want to rebuild Australian cricket, Chappell said.         
	We need to do that over the next few months and get together selectors, coaches and high-performance managers. I am sure there will be some strong views and we need to canvas all of those.         
	We have to look at the demands on the modern player and how we can adapt to different situations. Australian cricket needs to keep evolving, he was quoted as saying.         
	Another former captain, Steve Waugh, has said Ponting made a mistake by using part-time bowlers instead of his main strikers on the fourth day of the final Test in Nagpur. Ponting has been widely criticised for using part-time bowlers after tea on Sunday, when a few quick wickets could have given Australia a realistic chance of victory.         
	I am sure Ricky would regret the decision, Waugh told an Australian daily. Winning the Test match is what mattered. You have just spent six weeks in the subcontinent. You just dont take your foot off the gas.         
	Ponting was fined because Australia were behind on their overs but they had hustled enough for him to avoid a possible suspension for the first Test against New Zealand next week.         
	Waugh had some sympathy for Ponting and said everyone involved in Test cricket needed to keep the game moving quickly.         
	There are far too many stoppages, he said. I remember when I played it was considered a badge of honour not to have a drink in a session (apart from the scheduled drinks break). And no one died from dehydration. These days there are far too many drinks breaks. Its ridiculous. But it is just not the captains fault. It is up to coaches, referees and umpires to keep the show moving.         
	Ponting was branded an ordinary captain by one-time spearhead Jeff Thomson. I always thought he was an ordinary captain and this proves it, Thomson said. His captaincy calculator isnt that brilliant, is it? Dont get me wrong, hes a great batsman but an ordinary captain.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF polls set to be deferred
                                                                                                                                                                                                     AIFF polls set to be deferred
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The prolonged hospitalisation of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, has created a constitutional problem for the federation.         
	According to the AIFF constitution, which was revised as per the Fifa guidelines four years ago, the elections of the federation are supposed to be held by the end of December.         
	But with Das Munshi  who suffered a severe heart attack last month  showing no signs of recovery, other officials in the AIFF are in no mood to have an election.         
	The elections in the AIFF are held once in four years for the posts of president, five vice-presidents, treasurer and executive members. In the last elections in December 2004, Das Munshi had been elected unopposed for the fifth consecutive term.         
	He had also handpicked all the other office bearers and the 13 executive committee members.         
	The story would have been no different this time but Das Munshis illness has upset all calculations.         
	According to AIFF sources, majority of the members want the elections postponed till Das Munshi recovers.         
	The executive committee meeting will be held on November 22, said a source in the federation. The meeting is likely to recommend the postponement of the elections till Das Munshi recovers from his illness.         
	Most of the members are in favour of maintaining the status quo, the source added. We will also get the executive committee decision endorsed by the general body.         
	In the absence of Das Munshi, the meeting is likely to be chaired by the senior vice president and the Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel.

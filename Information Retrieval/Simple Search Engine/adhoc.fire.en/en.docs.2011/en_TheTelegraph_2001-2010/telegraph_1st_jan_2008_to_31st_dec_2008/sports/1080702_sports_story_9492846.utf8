  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -   Indias ODI vice-captain gets candid in Karachi         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                      Yuvraj Singh    
	Karachi: Team Indias ODI (and Twenty20) vice-captain Yuvraj Singh spoke to The Telegraph for around half-an-hour at the Pearl Continental on Tuesday afternoon. He didnt duck and his answers were candid.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q You were rested for the Asia Cup opener, but have been in good touch, helping finish off the last two matches (48, 36 not out)...         
	A Often, Ive been quite tight in the finishing-off stage... But, here, Ive been quite free and positive... Ive tried to enjoy my batting... In the past, Ive consciously tried to remain not out... In the last match (against Bangladesh), I didnt think of that... Just played freely.         
	Your last tour, to Australia didnt go off well. You struggled in the Tests and it was only later in the ODIs that you got into rhythm. Why?         
	There are times in a season when you dont play well... Sometimes, there are too many thoughts in your mind and there are too many people telling you too many things... I wouldnt call it negative feedback, but too much of over-information... Its best for the cricketer himself to try and understand his game... One does go through hiccups in ones career and thats the time to get back to the basics... Now, things are coming naturally out in the middle.         
	But you must have been disappointed at not making the most of opportunities in the first two Tests there?         
	I was, yes... Id been in form before the tour and had really been looking forward to doing well... I accept I had two bad Tests and, then, again suffered a knee injury (before the third Test)... Nothing worse couldve happened and it definitely wasnt a great tour for me mentally and physically... That wickets in Australia are great to bat on, once youve got used to the bounce and the swing, made me more disappointed... The chance to carry forward the pre-tour form came and went (in the Test series)...         
	When did you start feeling comfortable on that tour?         
	During my innings of 26 versus Australia in Adelaide... We lost that ODI, but I felt good... My feet moved better and I got the shots off the middle of the bat.         
	Were you, on that tour, distracted by anything off the field?         
	(Grins) When Ive done well, some have said that off the field distractions have helped... When I havent, then some have blamed off the field distractions... Im getting used to all this... Look, for me, the game is most important... Im focused... Off the field, everybody has a private life and people should allow me my space. Let me assure you that my priorities arent mixed up.         
	You arent a regular in the Test XI. When will that happen?         
	Dont know... Ill probably have to ask some of the seniors to retire! Getting just one or two Tests at a time has made me insecure... Irrespective of the format, every player needs to feel secure. Otherwise, he wont be able to give off his best... Of course, Im not blaming anybody... Ive myself got to make full use of every opportunity at the Test level... Having said that, I can only assess myself properly after Ive played 8-10 Tests in a year... Security in the mind is a critical element.         
	[While Yuvraj has already played 209 ODIs, his number of Tests stands at 23.]         
	Clearly, you need to shake off the label of a one-day cricketer...         
	Its disappointing (to be seen as a one-day specialist), but what can I do? Ive been trying my best for the past couple of years and will continue to do so. My Dad (Yograj) always tells me try, try till you die... Im following his advice.         
	Does not being a regular in Tests put you under pressure in the ODIs?         
	No... No... My frame of mind is different when Im playing the ODIs and its different when its Test cricket... In the ODIs, Im a lot more confident... Feel secure... Have a game plan... Indeed, I understand my game really well in one-day cricket... The more Test cricket I play, the more Ill understand my game at that level too.         
	The younger lot  Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Piyush Chawla and Ishant Sharma for example  is doing particularly well. Is it because theyre more confident of their abilities than most cricketers of the earlier generation?         
	I love the way they are and the way they play... Its a super bunch, willing to learn... Because of his background, most people thought Praveen Kumar wouldnt be knowing the finer points... But, as it turned out, they were wrong... Praveen knows quite a bit about cricket... Its not easy to come back after an injury/surgery, but Suresh has done so very well... I keep telling Rohit that he has been blessed with a skilful mind at such a young age and that he should use it to the fullest... Gautams graph is rising and thats because hes such a hard worker.         
	Whats the best way of handling youngsters?         
	Making them feel secure by giving them ample opportunities. The more secure the youngsters are, the better they will perform... Youve got to give them confidence, make them feel welcome in the dressing room. Theyve got to be made to feel that they belong...         
	Where would you place this team vis-a-vis the many others youve been a part of?         
	The best after the one which reached the 2003 World Cup final (under Sourav Ganguly).         
	Youve been the ODI (and Twenty20) vice-captain for a while now. Is there a clear role for you?         
	MS (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) is doing a good job and, so, I dont really have to do much... I do, however, speak to the younger lot... Give them confidence, share my experiences...         
	Some feel that, eventually, the 50-over game will disappear and it will only be Test cricket and Twenty20. Do you agree?         
	Could happen, because people today want entertainment... And, they want it fast... Its not that the 50-over game doesnt have its charm... You can come back in a 50-over game, but its very difficult doing that in Twenty20.         
	The Sri Lankan captain (Mahela Jayawardene) and the vice-captain (Kumara Sangakkara) played under you in the IPL... That must make it easier when the strategy for Thursdays face-off is finalised?         
	(Grins) Yes, Ive got some thoughts... Equally, theyll have something more on me.         
	Youll soon be completing eight years at the international level. What has the journey from Nairobi to Karachi taught you?         
	Ive learnt a lot... Initially, I used to be a nervous starter in the ODIs, not so now... Ive put a price on my wicket... Also, Ive realised that the longer I stay at the wicket, the bigger the threat to the opposition... I understand situations better, get to work around them better... Im trying to become both a better person and a better cricketer... Early on, Id be brash... Today, theres maturity.         
	Lastly, how are you looking at the next six-odd months?         
	Theres a lot of Test cricket coming up, in Sri Lanka, at home and, then, in Pakistan... I hope to play as many Tests as possible... I do have goals.

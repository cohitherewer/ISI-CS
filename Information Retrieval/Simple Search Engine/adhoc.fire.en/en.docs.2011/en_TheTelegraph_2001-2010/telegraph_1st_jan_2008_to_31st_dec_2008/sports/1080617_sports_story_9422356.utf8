                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arjuna: India are the favourites
                      
	Mumbai: India might have lost the recently concluded ODI tri-series to Pakistan but former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga says Mahendra Singh Dhonis men are the favourites to lift the Asia Cup later this month.         
	India have lot of young talented players including their one-day captain M.S. Dhoni, Ranatunga, chairman of the Sri Lankan Cricket Board said on the sidelines of a news conference organised by the Sri Lanka Airlines.         
	Praising the Indian skipper, Ranatunga said, Dhoni has crossed my imagination, he has done extremely well, he said.         
	The forthcoming Asia Cup would be a tough tournament as all the three main contestants India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan are well poised, the 1996 world cup winning captain said.         
	Meanwhile, Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene said they would love to restrict master-blaster Sachin Tendulkar from breaking Brian Laras world record in the forthcoming three Test series to be held in Sri Lanka.         
	Sachin is mere 171 runs behind Laras aggregate of 11,953 runs.         
	I would be happy to curtail Sachin with 170 runs in six innings to be played in our country, Jayawardene said.           (PTI)

                                                   P.T. Usha incident shocks Subhas

      A STAFF REPORTER 
              
	Calcutta: Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty on Thursday strongly criticised the 53rd National School Games organisers for denying the legendary P.T. Usha entry to the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium. 
    
	Ive never seen such a disorganised meet in my life, Chakraborty said, taking a dig at the organisers, District Schools Sports Association (South Calcutta). Im astonished that some of the organisers didnt recognise Usha and denied her entry. She is a legendary figure and the organisers should have realised that, he added. Usha was on Wednesday stopped at the VIP gate of the stadium by an official who didnt recognise her. It shouldnt have happened, Chakraborty said. 
    
	The minister also revealed another incident, seriously questioning the organisers credibility. They also initially denied entry to Keralas home minister. I was out of the city at that time but had to intervene, he said. 
    
	Education minister Partha Dey, however, apologised for Wednesdays incident. Meanwhile, Bengal bagged two golds on the penultimate day of the competition. Ranjila Khatun won the long jump event in the under-17 girls category while Kalyani Sikdar had a top podium finish in the girls under-14 200m dash.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | And, Nanavati shocks official 
                                                                                                                                                                                           And, Nanavati shocks official 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)-appointed inquiry commissioner, Sudhir Nanavati, has shocked a senior office-bearer by saying TV footage of Harbhajan Singh slapping Sreesanth had been shocking.         
	How can Mr Nanavati, himself a lawyer, make such a comment? He has no business talking to the media before submitting his report to the president (Sharad Pawar)... Such remarks will encourage people to believe hes bent on recommending exemplary punishment, the senior office-bearer told The Telegraph.         
	The senior office-bearer also took exception to Nanavatis comment that Harbhajan, already banned for the remainder of the Indian Premier League, would be punished twice.         
	Mr Nanavati should remember that he has to conduct an impartial inquiry... He cant be saying the things he has this (Tuesday) afternoon, the senior office-bearer added.         
	The senior office-bearer isnt the only one shocked by Nanavatis what I saw (in the footage) was shocking, but it has made my job easier... remark.         
	Also in that category is a former president of the BCCI. Its highly unusual for an inquiry commissioner to air his views, he pointed out.         
	Its to be seen whether the BCCI cautions Nanavati.         
	Nanavati, incidentally, will be meeting Harbhajan and Sreesanth later this week.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gayle needs surgery
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chris Gayle has been ruled out of the Indian Premier League after an MRI detected a hairline fracture in his groin on Monday.         
	The West Indies captain, who had been uncertain for Kolkata Knight Riders since his arrival in the city, was taken to a private hospital in the afternoon by physio Andrew Leipus.         
	Gayle has been advised surgery, but is apparently awaiting permission from the West Indies Cricket Board. He is to report for a camp back home on May 17.         
	The West Indies are to play a three Test and five ODI series against Australia from May 22.

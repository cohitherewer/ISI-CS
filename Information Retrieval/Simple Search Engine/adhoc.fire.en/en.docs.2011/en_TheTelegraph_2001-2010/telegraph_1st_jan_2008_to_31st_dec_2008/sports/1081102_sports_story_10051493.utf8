The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Intikhab wary of Paks lack of Test cricket
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Intikhab wary of Paks lack of Test cricket
    - Zaheer, Ishant have given India added edge           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Intikhab Alam                                 
	Calcutta: Intikhab Alams No. 1 worry isnt over either Shoaib Akhtar or Mohammed Asifs availability, but Pakistans lack of Test cricket for almost a year now.         
	Seems unbelievable, but its true.         
	Thirteen months wouldve gone without big-time cricket when we play India in the first Test (of the three-match series, in Karachi, from January 13)... Thats a concern as the players could be rusty, Intikhab, wholl formally be appointed coach within 48 hours, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Islamabad on Saturday afternoon, he added: In fact, ever since the Bangalore Test last December, the boys have played nothing more than ODIs or Twenty20... Test cricket, though, is vastly different and by regularly playing that form, India will arrive with an advantage...         
	Intikhab, a former captain, has been very impressed with Indias show in the ongoing series against Australia. I havent watched much of the last two days of the Kotla Test, but saw the first two matches on the TV... Today, India have a very balanced team and that has lifted the quality of their performance.         
	He didnt, of course, go as far as to say that the present team was Indias finest of all time, a view held by Ajit Wadekar. I dont believe in comparisons, as different eras have different challenges and the players respond to them differently.         
	According to Intikhab, who was coach when Pakistan won the 1992 World Cup under Imran Khan, the maturing of Zaheer Khan and the emergence of Ishant Sharma has made a significant difference.         
	India havent been short on good spinners, but Zaheer has never bowled better and Ishant is such a rapidly-improving quick... Indeed, Zaheers become so dangerous with the reverse swing... The bowling, therefore, has an added edge, Intikhab said.         
	However, its Indias batting that he fears more. That remains Indias strength... I know Sourav Ganguly wont be around and India wont have his experience, but his retirement will benefit some other batsman... Thats how the ball rolls in cricket...         
	A leggie himself, Intikhab sees Amit Mishra as promising. Hes definitely talented, but has a long way to go... Hell become a much better bowler once he adds the flipper to his armoury... What I particularly like about him is that hes a thinking leggie.         
	While Intikhab didnt go to the extent of doing an Ian Chappell, in that the Test captaincy too should straightaway be given to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, he made the point that the gloveman was ready for the biggest job in Indian sport.         
	Perhaps, in the region as well.         
	Dhonis produced results whenever opportunities have been there... Obviously, hes ready... My view is that if somebody is fit to lead in ODIs, then hes fit for that responsibility in Tests too... Personally, Id like one captain...         
	Having said as much, I accept that scenario changes if the Test captain either isnt available for selection (as has been the case in India for a year) or doesnt walk into the ODI XI... Anil Kumble is 38 and, clearly, isnt getting younger, Intikhab maintained.         
	Intikhabs maiden assignment in his latest innings will be the three-match ODI series against the West Indies in Abu Dhabi, later this month.         
	His first big challenge, though, will be at home in January-February during Indias tour for a Test series, five ODIs and a one-off Twenty20 shootout.         
	Huge challenge, yes... You could repeat that! the 66-year-old Intikhab, who has replaced Geoff Lawson, quipped.

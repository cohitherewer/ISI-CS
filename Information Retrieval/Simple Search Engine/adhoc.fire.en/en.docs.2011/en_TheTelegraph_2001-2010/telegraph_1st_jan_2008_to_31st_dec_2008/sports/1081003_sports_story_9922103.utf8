	New Delhi: Top-seed Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy began their campaign for back-to-back titles with a straight-set win over Spanish duo Guillermo Garcia-Lopez and Ivan Navarro in the first round of the $869,000 Japan Open Thursday.         
	The Indo-Czech pair, who won the Thailand Open last week, beat the unseeded Spanish duo 6-4, 7-5 in one hour and 13 minutes to advance to the quarter finals of the hard court event.         
	However, it was curtains for Rohan Bopanna and his American partner Eric Butorac, who put up a valiant fight against the second-seeded pair of Simon Aspelin and Julian Knowle but eventually lost 7-6 (4), 6-7 (4), 4-10 to bow out of the event.

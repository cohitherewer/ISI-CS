 - Honour of Indians paramount: BCCI
   A STAFF REPORTER
                 Anil Kumble
     
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Monday slammed the racial slur charge on Harbhajan Singh as blatantly false and described the three-Test ban imposed by International Cricket Council (ICC) Match Referee Mike Procter as patently unfair and unacceptable. 
    
	This was made clear in a media release issued by secretary Niranjan Shah. 
    
	BCCI president Sharad Pawar convened an emergency meeting of the senior Board members at his residence on Monday morning. 
    
	I have spoken to Anil Kumble, Sachin Tendulkar and manager Chetan Chauhan. I took their views and tried to understand the situation. After talking with them, we decided that we should appeal and demand that action against Harbhajan be dropped, Pawar told reporters. 
    
	The BCCI has also called an emergent working committee meeting in New Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the issue. 
    
	The BCCI filed an appeal with the ICC against the ban and asked the Indian team not to go to Canberra for a scheduled tour match from Thursday as part of the tactics to get its case heard. 
    
	The following is the full text of the media release: 
    
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India has viewed the happenings during the second cricket Test between India and Australia in Sydney with great concern as some of these can have a far-reaching impact on international cricket. Some of incidents are highly regrettable considering the warm and friendly relations between the Indian and Australian cricket Boards. 
    
	The incident involving Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds and the subsequent hearing by the ICC Match Referee and his conclusions are, to say the least, distressing. The Indian Board does not accept the findings of the Match Referee and has decided to challenge the unfair decision to suspend Harbhajan Singh as it deems it patently unfair. 
    
	The Board will appeal to the International Cricket Council to review the decision of the Match Referee and suspend its operation till the appeal is disposed of. The Indian Board realises the game of cricket is paramount but so too is the honour of the Indian team and for that matter every Indian. 
    
	To vindicate its position, the Board will fight the blatantly false and unfair slur on an Indian player. The Board also questions the very conduct of the hearing as the Match Referee before reaching his decision disregarded the essential point of any inquiry, that it should be based on facts, rational, detached and objective. 
    
	The Board, in particular, is unhappy with the charge of racial slur against Indias of-spinner Harbhajan Singh. Here it may be mentioned that it is an avowed policy of the Indian government to fight racial discrimination at every level and the India Board has been at the forefront to eradicate it from the game of cricket. For the Indian Board anti-racial stance is an article of faith as it is for the entire nation which fought the apartheid policies. The Board has always fought the racist sledging of players and spectators and it will continue to do so.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne lessons for Clarke 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Warne lessons for Clarke 
                      
	Melbourne: Shane Warne may not be part of the Australian squad on the tour of India but the retired spin great is doing his bit to ensure that his compatriots come out with flying colours against Anil Kumbles men in the four-match Test series starting next month.         
	Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke revealed he is taking lessons from the leg-spin legend to combat the spinner-friendly tracks in India.         
	I spent four days with Warnie before I came (to Darwin) and did a lot of talking and going through field placements for my type of bowling, which I found really helpful, said Clarke, hoping to repeat his performance in India when he took 6/9 in Mumbai during the cricket teams winning tour in 2004.         
	I will be on the phone to him continuously, Clarke was quoted by a newspaper here after Australia wrapped up the one-day Top End series 3-0 against Bangladesh.         
	My back touch wood has been really good, I certainly dont see that as a problem. Now when I get home, Ill do some more work (on spin bowling), said the stand-in one-day skipper, who had a lean series with the bat.         
	I think battings my priority, he said. I have always been serious about my bowling... I do believe I am a part-time bowler and Im not going to try and be a front-line bowler but as I said, I think there is a role for me to play over there.         
	Australias spin trio of Beau Casson, Bryce McGain and Jason Krejza are currently touring India with the A team.         
	Among them Casson has a one-Test experience when he made his debut against the West Indies in June. (PTI)

	Chittagong: Ross Taylor struck his third one-day century on Tuesday to set New Zealand up for a series-winning 79-run victory in the third limited overs international against Bangladesh.         
	Bangladesh, chasing 250 runs to win, struggled to 170 for eight from their 50 overs.         
	Taylor scored 103 from 119 balls, hitting four towering sixes and five boundaries. He was finally out caught by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim while attempting a pull shot off Mashrafe Mortaza.         
	No.3 Jamie How scored 73 after openers Jesse Ryder and Brendon McCullum were dismissed in the first six overs. He hit 10 boundaries from 82 balls.         
	Meanwhile, Bangladesh named two new caps on Tuesday in a 13-man squad for the Test series against New Zealand. Pacer Mahbubul Alam and batsman Naeem Islam joined recalled batsman Rajin Saleh in the squad.

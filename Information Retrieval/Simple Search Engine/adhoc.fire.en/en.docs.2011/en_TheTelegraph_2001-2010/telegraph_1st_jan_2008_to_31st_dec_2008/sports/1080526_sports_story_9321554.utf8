	Jaipur: Mumbai Indians skipper Sachin Tendulkar today said he was looking ahead to renew his famous rivalry with Shane Warne when his team lock horns with the Rajasthan Royals in a crucial Indian Premier League match on Monday.         
	Tendulkar and Warne, despite being good friends off the field, have featured in many duels with the Indian coming out with flying colours on most occasions.         
	Though Warne has retired from International cricket, Mondays match once again pits him against Tendulkar, who said he was looking forward to facing the leg-spinner again.         
	Im looking forward to play against Warne. He is a great bowler and I have always loved the challenge of facing him, Tendulkar said.         
	He has always been a fantastic, challenging and a terrific player. We are competitive on the field but otherwise, we are good friends, he added.           (PTI)

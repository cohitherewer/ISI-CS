The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chopra, Mickelson miss cut 
                                                Chopra, Mickelson miss cut 
                      
	Pebble Beach: A final-hole double bogey dashed Daniel Chopras hopes of making the cut at the AT amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am after the third round on Saturday.         
	Chopra carded his second successive 75, beginning the round with a triple bogey that was followed by a bogey. The Indian-born Swede birdied the sixth, 10th and the 14th holes to stay afloat but dropped two shots on the final. He totalled 219 to miss the cut by two shots.         
	Also missing the cut was three-time winner Phil Mickelson, who won last years title by a record equalling five strokes. He carded a 78 that featured a sextuple-bogey 11 and a total of 33 putts.         
	American Dudley Hart, sidelined for much of last year taking care of his sick wife, charged into a share of the lead with former world No. 1 Vijai Singh of Fiji.         
	The 39-year-old birdied three of the last four holes for a flawless four-under-par 68. That left him at nine-under 207, level with Singh who fired a 67.         
	PGA Tour rookie Dustin Johnson holed out from 85 yards to eagle the 13th en route to a 68 and a tie for third at seven under with fellow-American Michael Allen (71).         
	Padraig Harrington got to within a stroke of the lead before running up a triple bogey eight on 11. He carded a 70 to finish tied 19th. (AGENCIES)

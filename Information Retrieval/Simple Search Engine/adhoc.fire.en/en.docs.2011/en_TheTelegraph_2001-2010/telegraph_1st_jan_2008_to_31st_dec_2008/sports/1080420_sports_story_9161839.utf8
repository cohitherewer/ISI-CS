	Kazan (Russia): Indian womens hockey team squandered numerous sitters but still managed a comfortable 3-1 win against Russia in their first match of the Olympic qualifier on Saturday.         
	Fifteen-year-old Rani Devi scored in her debut match to open the account for India in the ninth minute. Russia restored parity with Anna Guteneva scoring in the first minute of the second half.         
	Jasjeet scored the second one through a field goal midway through the second half. And two minutes before the final whistle, Pritamrani Siwach added the third.         
	Meanwhile, technical advisor Ric Charlesworths work permit has expired and the Aussie, who is accompanying the womens hockey team at the Olympic qualifiers here, may face problems in coming back to India.         
	According to a source, unless Charlesworths work permit is renewed, he may find it difficult to return to India after the tournament.         
	However, a sports ministry source in New Delhi said Charlesworths case had already been forwarded to the home ministry for extension of his work permit. (PTI)

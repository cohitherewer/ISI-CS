	Dresden: Riding a final round 3-1 victory over Slovakia, the Indian mens team finished 16th while the women had to be content with a 15th place finish in the 32nd Chess Olympiad.         
	P. Harikrishna and Surya Sekhar Ganguly guided the Indian men to victory while Krishnan Sasikiran and G.N. Gopal played out draws. Harikrishna scored at the expense of Luboimir Ftacnik while Ganguly got the better of Tomas Petrik.         
	The Indian women could have finished better but for a miscalculation by D. Harika that saw her lose the final round game against Elina Danielian of Armenia. The other three boards ended in draws. Tania Sachdev drew with Lilit Mkrtchian while Swati Ghate and Mary Ann Gomes drew with Nelly Aginian and Lilit Galojan respectively.         
	 In a nail-biting finale, Armenian men retained the crown in the open section after beating China by a minimal 2.5-1.5 margin.         
	The silver in this section went to Israel after they bounced back to beat Holland 2.5-1.5, while the US men handed a 3.5-0.5 drubbing to second seed Ukraine to stake their claim for the bronze.         
	For the record, the Armenians ended with 19 match points, Israel finished on 18 while the USAs victory took them ahead of Ukraine in tiebreak for a creditable third finish. None of the top seven ranked teams won a medal.         
	In the womens section, Georgia regained the crown defeating Serbia. The overnight leader Poland went down to Ukraine on the top board and out of medal contention.         
	The Georgian women finished with (18) points and had a better tiebreak score than Ukraine who finished second. The USA women finished third here beating France by a 2.5-1.5 margin and ending on 17 points with better a tiebreak score than Russia and Poland respectively.         
	For the Georgian women the contribution of former world champion Maia Chiburdanidze proved to be most useful as the veteran Grandmaster registered a rating performance of 2715 points in her 7.5/9 score.         
	The 32nd edition of the Olympiad had 144 teams participating in the open section, while there were 111 teams in the womens. For every victory the teams were awarded 2 match points while in the event of a drawn 2-2 result the points were shared. In the open section Armenia won nine matches, drew one and lost one while in the womens Georgia won eight and drew two matches.

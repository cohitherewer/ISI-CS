	London: Russian money proved stronger than Arab as Chelsea prevailed in the Clash of the Cash on Saturday, when Chelsea and Manchester City faced-off, as reported in Saturdays Late City edition.         
	Robinho, snatched from under the noses of Chelsea by Man City marked his debut by opening the scoring with a curling free kick after 13 minutes.         
	Chelsea equalised through Ricardo Carvalho three minutes later and they dominated from then on. Frank Lampard started and finished a sweeping 70-metre break before Nicolas Anelka got the third.         
	The only downside for Chelsea was a late red card for John Terry for a professional foul.         
	Tim Cahill marked his return from a long injury lay-off to earn Everton a 3-2 victory at Stoke City on Sunday.         
	The Australian headed past Stoke keeper Thomas Sorensen with 13 minutes remaining after the home side had battled back from 0-2 down.         
	Everton had a strong penalty claim turned down minutes before Cahills winner, leading to their angry manager David Moyes being banished from the technical area.         
	Cahill missed the final part of last season and the beginning of the new campaign with a foot injury.         
	Everton seemed to be cruising when Victor Anichebe added to Yakubu Aiyegbenis well-taken opener just after halftime but Stoke hit back with a powerful volley from Nigerian Seyi Olofinjana after Everton failed to clear.         
	The hosts had a goal harshly disallowed when Ricardo Fuller muscled past Joseph Yobo and finished calmly but was adjudged to have fouled the Everton defender.         
	Stoke equalised in direct fashion when Rory Delaps long throw glanced off the head of Phil Jagielka and past keeper Tim Howard.         
	After Cahills goal Stoke launched a series of aerial attacks but Everton held on to move into mid-table with six points from four games, both of their victories coming away from home. Stoke slip to second from bottom.         
	Chelsea top the table after their 3-1 victory at Manchester City on Saturday. They have 10 points along with Liverpool who beat champions Manchester United 2-1 at Anfield.         
	Tottenham Hotspur face Aston Villa at home on Monday still seeking their first win of the season.           (REUTERS)

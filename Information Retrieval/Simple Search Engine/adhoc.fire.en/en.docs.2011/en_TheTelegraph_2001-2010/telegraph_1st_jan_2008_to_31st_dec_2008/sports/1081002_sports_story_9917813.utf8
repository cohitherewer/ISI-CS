	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Wednesday congratulated Sourav Ganguly on his inclusion in the squad for the first two Tests against Australia.         
	The former India captain met Dalmiya at Eden Gardens shortly after the squad was announced in Mumbai. Dalmiya said he was very happy that the southpaw had been selected to the national side after being overlooked for the Irani Trophy.         
	We are very happy We wish him all the best. We want him to play well, Dalmiya told reporters after meeting Sourav for around 20 minutes.         
	I have seen him closely and believe strongly that he has made it big on his own merit. Theres a lot of cricket still left in him, and undoubtedly, he will continue doing well.         
	Dalmiya also requested Sourav to lead the state in their Ranji Trophy Plate group campaign. We had a discussion. I spoke to him about our domestic cricket On behalf of the association, I asked him to play for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy and told him that he should lead the side.         
	Souravs decision will depend, to a very large extent, on his Team India commitments, but Dalmiya was hopeful that he would be able to find time for the state team. Souravs participation, he said, would be a definite boost to the side. I strongly believe that his presence will motivate the side.

                                                   Aloke looks for a Super start today

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Gurgaon: The newly-appointed East Bengal coach, Aloke Mukherjee, is determined to start his campaign on a winning note in the Super Cup match against Dempo on Wednesday. 
    
	Aloke, who took over from Manoranjan Bhattacharjee after the I-League, said his team was good enough to beat any team in the country. 
    
	We started the season well by winning the Federation Cup. Unfortunately, we slipped thereafter and finished sixth in the I-League. The boys are capable of doing much better. 
    
	Manoranjan was to coach the team for the Super Cup. But since Manoranjan stepped down immediately after the I-League, Aloke was not registered as the coach and hence the latter was initially not allowed to sit on the team bench. AIFF, however, has now given Aloke special permission to sit with the team. 
    
	The coach said his team would go all out to win the tournament. We will do our best to win this match. Dempo must be supremely confident, especially after their triumph in the I-League, but we will give our best. 
    
	East Bengal, who arrived on Monday night and practised on Tuesday, are likely to field the same team that played in the last match against Sporting Clube de Goa in the I-League. 
    
	I have just taken over. So I wont experiment, Aloke said. 
    
	Dempo are not taking the match lightly. Last year, we lost the Super Cup to Mohun Bagan 0-4. That was not a good experience, recalled Dempo coach Mauricio Afonso. 
    
	We want to end the campaign on a high note, he said. 
    
	The coach is not in favour of changing the winning combination for the match and maintained that the same XI, who played against Viva Kerala in the last match of the I-League, will be fielded. 
    
	The winners of the Super Cup will receive Rs 10 lakhs. The match starts at 4.30pm.

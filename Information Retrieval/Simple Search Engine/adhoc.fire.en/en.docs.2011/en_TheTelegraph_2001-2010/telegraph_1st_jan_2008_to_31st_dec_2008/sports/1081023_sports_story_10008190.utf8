The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ballack in trouble with Loew
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ballack in trouble with Loew
                      
	Berlin: Germany coach Joachim Loew summoned Michael Ballack to a meeting and hinted strongly that his future as captain was under threat on Wednesday after the midfielder publicly criticised his handling of selection issues.         
	Loew strongly reprimanded Ballack but said he would wait to speak to him in person before deciding what, if any, action to take after the Chelsea player called for senior players to be shown more respect.         
	I will tell Michael that Im extremely disappointed about the route he has chosen to take, and that his comments are unacceptable, Loew said in a statement released by the DFB on Wednesday.         
	I cannot accept it and I will insist on the meeting ... My decision on everything else will depend on how that conversation goes. (Reuters)

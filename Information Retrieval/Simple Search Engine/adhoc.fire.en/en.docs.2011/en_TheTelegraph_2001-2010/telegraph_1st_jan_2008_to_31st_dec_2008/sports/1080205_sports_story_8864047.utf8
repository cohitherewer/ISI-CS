                                                   Sangram stood in our way: Subhas

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Salgaocar technical director Subhas Bhowmick was utterly disappointed with their 0-1 loss to Mohun Bagan Monday. 
    
	We have been playing well in every match but only to end up losing after conceding silly goals, said Bhowmick. He felt that the chance factor didnt work for them. You cannot win if you dont have the chance factor working for you. 
    
	Praising Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee, who was adjudged Man of the Match, the new Salgaocar TD said: Sangram was superb under the bar. In fact, he who stood in our way. 
    
	But the former East Bengal coach seemed to have lost all hopes of saving the relegation this time though didnt say it in as many words. I dont know what nextwe will take on Viva Kerala, he added. 
    
	Even after bagging full points, Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira was not happy as at least five of their key players will have to sit out against Dempo Saturday.

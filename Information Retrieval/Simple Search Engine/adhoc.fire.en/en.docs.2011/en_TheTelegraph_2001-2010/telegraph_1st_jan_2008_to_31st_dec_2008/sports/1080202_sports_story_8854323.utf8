                                                   Australian PM asks cricketers to behave

      SHARP SINGLES / Down Under
        
	 Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has bluntly told his countrys cricketers to exhibit more civility on the field. 
    
	Rudd said cricket was a gentlemans game and people would expect a bit more civility from the players, according to Fridays edition of The Australian. 
    
	The Prime Minister, speaking to a radio channel, was reacting to captain Ricky Pontings reply to Australian governor-general Michael Jeffery that unlike 1950s cricket was not mere a sport but had turned fully professional and players tend to lose tempers under pressure. 
    
	I think the governor-generals perfectly entitled to express his point of view. And on the question of civility in the game, I think that all your listeners would like to witness greater civility in the game generally. Rudd said that he was not apportioning blame to either team, but said there was room for manners no matter how tough the game. 
    
	Its a tough and competitive business (but) you can conduct it with a bit of civility, he said. 
    
	Well give it back, says Sreesanth 
    
	 Indian seamer Sreesanth has declared that India wont shy away from any on-field confrontation despite the fact that an ugly spat between Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds was about to scrap the ongoing tour. Sreesanth, known for his aggression, missed the four-Test series owing to a shoulder injury but is now fit to play in the tri-series. 
    
	We never backed down. Why should we? We have players who can give it back with interest, Sreesanth said. 
    
	Whats the worst that can happen? Six sixes? I can always come back next over. All I need is just one ball to get (the batsman) out, he was quoted as saying by the Herald Sun. 
    
	Players to write protest letter 
    
	 Bitter that they were not backed to the hilt by their board in the now-resolved racism row, Australian cricketers have decided to protest against Cricket Australia (CA) by writing a letter. Through their representative body, the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA), Ponting amp; Co. will formally air their disappointment to a CA official, who they believe had pressured them into accepting a move to downgrade the racism against Harbhajan, according to a Sydney Morning Herald report. The move has the support of ACA president Darren Lehmann. 
    
	CA move 
    
	 Cricket Australia (CA) is pushing ahead with plans for night Test cricket and is negotiating with scientists to develop an appropriate ball that will last 80 overs and be visible to batsmen, according to a report in The Australian. 
    
	A working party has been established and CAs chief science officer at the Centre of Excellence is about to approach the CSIRO to see if that organisation will be a partner in the research and development of a new ball. The Weekend Australian revealed plans for night Tests last December but the idea was immediately howled down by cricket ball manufacturer Kookaburra.

                                                    East Bengal face Salgaocar in key clash

	Panaji: East Bengal and Salgaocar will be in a battle for survival when they meet in the 10th round of the ONGC I-League at the Nehru Stadium on Monday. 
    
	Salgaocar, who lost to East Bengal earlier in the campaign, have not won a single match so far collecting four points from nine matches. East Bengal have seven. 
    
	The hosts would be hopeful that the return of Boniface Ambani can do the trick against the Subrata Bhattachrayas side. 
    
	Salgaocars main concern is finishing, which let them down against Mohun Bagan and JCT. The defence is another worry as it tends to cave in under pressure. 
    
	Tomorrows match is tough and we need to raise our level and cash in on the chances that come our way, said Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira. 
    
	Like us, East Bengals morale is also down and we need to take advantage and score an early goal to put pressure on them, Medeira said. 
    
	East Bengal coach Bhattacharya is worried about his teams poor performance, especially in their last match against Sporting Clube de Goa. 
    
	He said the foreigners have let the team down badly which was the main concern. 
    
	With Ashim Biswas down with injury, East Bengal were facing another blow. 
    
	The morale of the team is down after a series of losses and I dont know how to start afresh, Bhattacharya said. 
    
	The boys must work hard and play positive if we are to win tomorrow against Salgaocar who are also struggling to find their winning ways, he added. (PTI)

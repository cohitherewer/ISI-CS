The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods awaits recovery post knee surgery 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Woods awaits recovery post knee surgery 
            LEWINE MAIR            Tiger Woods drops to his knees during the US Open recently                           
	Tiger Woods has not flown to this weeks AT amp;T at Congressional in Maryland, where he has traditionally served as tournament host. Flying swells up my leg pretty good, explained Woods, who limped to victory in the recent US Open at Torrey Pines before undergoing an operation on June 24.         
	His specialist took a tendon from Woodss right hamstring to reconstruct his left anterior cruciate ligament. The leg is currently in a brace and Woods will need crutches for three weeks.         
	As to the recovery time, Woods pointed to how some are back to playing sport after six months, some after nine and some after 12.         
	The world No.1 has been told that once rehabilitation is complete, his leg will be in better shape than at any time in the past decade.         
	The AT amp;T National was put together in less than four months after the green light was given.         
	What we did in such a short span of time was absolutely remarkable, Woods said. Its hard to believe that, with the help of the membership, the PGA Tour and all of our staff, we put this tournament together so quickly.         
	Meanwhile, Kirsty Taylor, who had brain surgery in January followed by six weeks of radiotherapy, returns at this weeks Ladies English Open at the Oxfordshire. The 37-year-old Englishwoman is still waiting for all clear but she is desperate to get back to work.         
	Across country at the London Club, the men are playing the European Open in a week that sees the start of the drug-testing era.         
	Rocco Mediate spoke for many when he said: Its the biggest joke. You could sit in the parking lot and drink a fifth of vodka and you might get a fine.

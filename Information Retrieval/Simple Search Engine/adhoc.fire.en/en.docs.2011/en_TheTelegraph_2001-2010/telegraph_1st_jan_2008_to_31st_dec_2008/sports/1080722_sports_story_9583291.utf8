            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: The Indian and Sri Lankan teams were briefed about the umpire referral system, which will be introduced during the forthcoming Test series, on Monday evening.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, confusion on a few points remained, but things should be totally clear sooner rather than later.         
	The International Cricket Councils (ICC) general manager (cricket), Dave Richardson, held centre stage during the briefing.

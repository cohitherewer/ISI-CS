The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Peeved Kuranyi walks out 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Peeved Kuranyi walks out 
                      
	Milan: Kevin Kuranyis decision to walk out on the national team has disrupted Germanys preparations for Wednesdays tie against Wales and overshadowed Saturdays important 2-1 win over Russia.         
	The Schalke 04 striker was upset at being left out of the 18-man squad to play Russia and did not return to the team hotel after watching the first half in the stands. Loew said on Sunday he will not be selected again.         
	We were all surprised by Kevins early departure, he said on the German soccer federations web site.         
	Elsewhere in Europe, Alberto Gilardino can take over from struggling Luca Toni as Italys main striker if he impresses in Wednesdays World Cup qualifying Group Eight game at home to Montenegro.         
	Toni, 31, is suspended for the match in Lecce having picked up a booking as a substitute in Saturdays 0-0 draw in Bulgaria.         
	The 26-year-old Gilardino has netted four times in Serie A this season but it was still a slight surprise when coach Marcello Lippi, who had Gilardino in his 2006 World Cup-winning squad, included him ahead of Toni on Saturday.         
	Fabio Quagliarella has replaced Toni in the squad, meaning the group leaders now boast three Udinese forwards. Portugal go into their World Cup qualifier against Albania in Braga with coach Carlos Queiroz in no doubt they will reach the 2010 finals despite a shock defeat in their previous home tie.         
	Without a doubt, Im convinced well qualify (for South Africa), Queiroz said after Portugal drew 0-0 with Sweden in Stockholm in their third Group One game on Saturday.         
	Five-time world champions Brazil cancelled a planned training session on Monday after an exhausting journey back from their World Cup qualifier in Venezuela, which started with a three-hour bus journey along twisting mountain roads.         
	Brazil are likely to face a tougher task against Colombia who are likely to pack their defence.         
	With Luis Fabiano and Adriano unavailable, Dunga is likely to field either Jo or Alexandre Pato alongside Robinho in attack.           (AGENCIES)

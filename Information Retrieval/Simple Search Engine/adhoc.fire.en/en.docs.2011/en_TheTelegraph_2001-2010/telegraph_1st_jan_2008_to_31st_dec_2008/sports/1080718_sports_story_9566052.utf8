The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dont duck Tests for IPL: Ranatunga
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dont duck Tests for IPL: Ranatunga
                  Ranatunga                     
	Chennai: In an apparent reference to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga on Thursday came down heavily on players dodging Test cricket to play in cash-rich Twenty20 leagues.         
	Some players complain of tiredness due to the busy schedule. Unfortunately, when it comes to the IPL they are not tired, Ranatunga said, without mentioning any names. Ranatunga said players should not ruin Test cricket for the sake of money.         
	It is most important to preserve Test cricket. As far as I am concerned when it comes to Twenty20, it is a purely money making business, he said on the sidelines of a tourism promotion event. Ranatunga also felt the International Cricket Council (ICC) must prepare a balanced itinerary to address the issue of players burnout.         
	Players should come forward and chalk out a proposal to ICC regarding how many one-day Internationals (ODI) and Tests should be played in a calendar year, he said. Based on the proposal, the ICC should prepare a balanced itinerary so that there is an equal proportion of both ODI and Test cricket in a year, he added. As far as I am concerned, a player can play a maximum of 35 ODIs and 15 Test matches a year, Ranatunga said         
	Ranatunga also took note of Sri Lankan cricketers request for rescheduling next years Test tour of England as the dates clash with the IPL.         
	Predicting some really high quality action during the upcoming home series against India, Ranatunga said it would be a good spin attack against the worlds best batting line-up.         
	However, the former skipper maintained that the Lankan bowlers should be patient in putting the ball in the right areas. Test cricket is different from one-day Internationals. We need to be patient especially in the bowling department, he said. Asked whether Sri Lankas new bowling sensation Ajantha Mendis would be included in the playing XI for the first Test to be held on July 23, he said it was up to the selection committee to decide.         
	As far as I am concerned, Mendis should be included in the playing XI for the first Test. I would like to see both Muralidharan and Mendis bowling at both ends to Sachin (Tendulkar) and Sourav (Ganguly).         
	Ranatunga also gave Pakistan the thumbs up ahead of the important ICC meeting at the weekend to discuss security concerns for the Champions Trophy to be held there in September.         
	We have no problem in playing in Pakistan or India. Pakistan hosted six teams very well recently at the Asia cup and I was there for the final. It was very well organised, said the 1996 World Cup-winning Sri Lanka captain.         
	So far the championship is in Pakistan and we have been told we are in the standby position, he added. (PTI)

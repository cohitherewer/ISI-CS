The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi unhappy
                                                                                                                                                                                           Bhupathi unhappy
                      
	Beijing: Unhappy with the draw, Indian tennis ace Mahesh Bhupathi on Thursday said it was unfortunate that some good doubles teams will be ousted in the first round just because the International Tennis Federation (ITF) was not consistent in its seedings rules.         
	Bhupathi objected to seedings given to singles specialist players, saying it would keep them safe while some of the good teams will face-off each other in the first round and get eliminated because of the unusual seedings this time.         
	He said Israeli third seeds Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram would face Frances Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra in the first round while singles specialists David Ferrer and Nicolas Almagro of Spain, being fifth seeded, will avoid an early exit.         
	Youve got some great doubles teams playing each other in the first round and these singles guys get to play doubles. I dont think they deserve to be seeded, honestly, Bhupathi said.         
	Teams like Ferrer and Almagro might be dangerous teams but they definitely dont deserve to be seeded in the doubles draw, he added.         
	According to the ITF rules, teams can be seeded based on the players singles or doubles ranking at the Olympics while in other tournaments, only the doubles ranking applies.         
	Theres got to be some consistency in this world. You cant just show up at the Olympics and do what you feel.         
	It is the first time Ive seen this happen. I dont know what the agenda with the ITF is, but I think its pretty unfortunate that theyre doing that, he said. (PTI)

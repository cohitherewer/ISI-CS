The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan scrape through
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bagan scrape through
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan managed to put some distance between them and the chasing pack in the Sahara CFL Premier Division, by beating Railway FC 1-0 at their home ground on Tuesday. The league leaders are now on 23 points from 10 matches.         
	The match though was largely a dull affair as creative flair was in serious shortage, as was the spectator count after the Subrata Bhattacharjee fiasco. Fans present were on their best behaviour as their every move was being videotaped. Kartick Kisku provided some sparks with his runs down the left. Kiskus cut back from the left touchline to Malswamtluanga inside the six-yard box almost resulted in the opening goal, but the Bagan forward faltered.         
	Railway FC midfielder Dinesh Swar took a snap-shot from 30 yards out after a sharp half-turn, that kissed the cross-piece on its way out. As the otherwise uneventful half was drawing to a close, the green and maroon brigade took the lead through right back Habibur Rehman Mondals goal. The scrappy and somewhat contentious goal came after Railway FC keeper Rakesh Prasad failed to hold on to a long Peter Odafe throw. Television replays suggested that the ball then hit Habibur Rehmans arm before he volleyed it in.         
	United SC drew CPT 1-1 in another tie.

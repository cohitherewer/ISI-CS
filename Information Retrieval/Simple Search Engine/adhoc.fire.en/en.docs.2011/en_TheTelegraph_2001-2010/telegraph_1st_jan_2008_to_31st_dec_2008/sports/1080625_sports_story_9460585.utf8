  - Kapils positive leadership played a big role in our triumph               GUEST COLUMN    Mohinder Amarnath                                        
	If theres something I would like to live through again, it would be Lords on June 25, 1983. Twenty-five years is a long time but it still seems so fresh in memory. I can still feel the pulse of the thousands waving the Tricolour in the stands, their wild chanting and the heartbroken West Indian fans. What a sight it made for!         
	Last man Michael Holdings dismissal off my bowling helped us seal the victory. That remains the most endearing moment of my life. The instant the ball hit the pads I saw Dickie Bird raise the finger almost simultaneously as we went up in appeal.         
	What followed was total chaos! I ran like a man possessed to grab the wicket as a memento. I could have picked up the ball too, lying almost next to me, but it was the wicket that I wanted! After managing to snatch a bail, I dashed towards the dressing room. I think that was the fastest sprint of my life!         
	I saw the crowd had already invaded the ground and didnt want to be mobbed. Most of my teammates were already back there and I wanted to join them and enjoy the moment. The party continued late into the night, perhaps till early next morning. It seemed like the world was on our feet! Champagne flowed as bottles had been arranged for in advance. Even the one I got for my Man of the Match award was finished in a jiffy.                   
	Many people still ask me if we had ever thought of winning the Cup. I think we made our intentions pretty clear by defeating the West Indies in the campaign opener and followed it up by thrashing minnows Zimbabwe, with Madanlal playing a pivotal role. The euphoria was short lived as we lost to Australia in the next match.         
	The return leg match against Zimbabwe started disastrously as we were reduced to 17 for five. We were disappointed but knew well that their limitations could undo their good work. Kapil Dev then played that historic 175 not out that put us back on the road to the title. It was his day and he played the innings of his life. He batted like a leader and a champion and demoralised the opposition into submission.         
	After returning to the pavilion, I was so disheartened that I didnt watch the match for some time. Only once Kapil started throwing his bat around that I came out from the dressing room. The innings proved to be the right tonic for a side craving for success. We still needed to beat Australia to make the semis and Kapils innings raised our confidence to a level from where we never looked back.         
	Kapils positive leadership did play a big role in our triumph. He was very young then and the only experience he had as a captain was in his debut series in the West Indies. He was very raw compared to Sunil Gavaskar from whom he had taken over.         
	His captaincy was more like his personality, aggressive and all by instinct. He did what his heart told him and was prepared to take risks. India hadnt seen such an instinctive captain since and it all made for a new approach. It worked perfectly in the 1983 World Cup, especially in the must-win return-leg game against Australia. The English conditions also helped us, specially our seam bowlers.         
	I think Kapil matured as a captain during the 1987 World Cup, but sadly he was sacked after that. Had he continued from there on, he would have been reckoned as one of the finest captains India ever had. But such are the whimsical ways of Indian cricket that we sacrifice the virtues of patience and pragmatism in our quest for success.         
	Kapils instinctive leadership showed in the way he picked the team and handled his resources during the tournament. A classic example was Roger Binny, who was the unsung hero of our triumph. He always provided the breakthroughs as the batsmen dared to take risk against him.         
	In the semi-final at Old Trafford, we needed 214 and the openers were dismissed cheaply. Then Yashpal and myself put on 92 runs for the third wicket that put us on the path to victory. However, we knew all through that the target wasnt difficult as we had a strong batting line-up. It was a memorable experience batting with Yashpal. We were a little slow at the outset, but in a 60-over-a-side contest you had plenty of time in hand.         
	Once we decided to step up the scoring rate, I played a few risky shots. Yashpal was also not to be left behind and hit an amazing six, flicking Bob Willis over square leg. As I went up to congratulate him, he told me that he was trying to settle a score with Willis who had abused him during the last series back home. All the conversation was in Punjabi and despite our high pitch voice, Willis couldnt fathom a word. We didnt forget to share a good laugh.         
	One important aspect of the victory was the team effort. Everyone contributed, be it in a small way, and that made it possible in the end. Everyone was eager to put in their best and it showed in the performance.         
	After my dismissal, Yashpal and Sandeep Patil finished the remaining work. Sandeep blasted Willis all over the park. With the scores tied, the crowd ran on to the ground thinking India had won the match. It made for a great sight as the spectators, waving the Tricolour all over, were made to return back to their seats for that one unfinished run. Finally when Sandeep hit the winning run, all the players sprinted back to the dressing room with none making an attempt to stop the boundary.         
	We went into the final confident and not reading much into the West Indies awesome record. Contrary to what people still think, there wasnt much discussion or talk after we managed just 183. Nothing really seemed to affect us as we knew that early wickets would get us back into the match. The conditions, as usual, were to the seamers liking. We had quality pacers and believed that they would deliver.         
	Balwinder Singh Sandhu always troubled Gordon Greenidge and didnt disappoint this time too as the opener misjudged the inswinger. We got the desired start and were unfazed in the face of Viv Richards onslaught that followed. We knew he batted that way and loved to show the world, especially at Lords, that he was the boss. He had done a similar act in the 1979 final versus England.         
	We tried not to bowl to his strengths but Viv was uncontrollable when on song. We simply had to wait for him to make a mistake, which didnt take too long. A lot had been said about Kapils marvellous running catch that saw the back of Viv, but Madanlal, who somehow managed to convince Kapil to continue with him despite the thrashing in the previous over, should also deserve the credit. The ball wasnt short enough to pull and the catch wasnt simple to take.         
	The fall of regular wickets demolished West Indies hopes. Their top-order was wrecked by our main bowlers, and I followed it up by running through the lower order.         
	Jeff Dujon provided me with a wicket off the first ball, a warm up delivery. The pressure seemed to tell on Clive Lloyds men as we tightened the noose on them. Malcolm Marshalls wicket was well planned and gave me the most satisfaction. When I asked Kapil for a slip, he was shocked. I told him I had a different plan knowing well that Malcolm was strong on the onside. The ball moved away from the off stump and he was forced to hold his bat out for Sunil to comfortably hold on to the chance at slip.         
	The end was near! West Indies hopes of a hattrick of triumphs were dashed. It marked the beginning of a new era in world cricket. We had proved the world wrong. It seemed like we were living a never-ending dream. Twenty five years later, I still yearn to relive that day!

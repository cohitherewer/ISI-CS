            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Two of Indias most sought after footballers  Steven Dias and NP Pradeep  could find themselves in trouble if they stick to their plan of quitting Mahindra United in favour of East Bengal.         
	The duo are under contract with the Mumbai side till 2010 but have decided to switch over to the red-and-yellow-brigade in Calcutta this season.         
	The two have reportedly accepted advance payment from East Bengal already.         
	According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, there is distinct possibility that the two national team stars may have to face the Players Status Committee if they finally decide to officially sign on the dotted line for East Bengal during the inter-state transfer.         
	Mahindra are definitely going to protest against the transfer of these two players.         
	In that case, both the players will not be allowed to play for either clubs in the domestic season till a decision is reached on their status.         
	Sources said that the duo, in an apparent attempt to break away from their contract with the Mahindra United, have written a letter to the club management explaining why they do not want to continue with the Mumbai outfit. A copy of the letter has also been given to the AIFF.         
	Surprisingly, the language of both the letters is same, though written separately by Dias and Pradeep, sources said. It is quite clear that the letter has either been drafted jointly by the two players or has been dictated by someone, who wants the two players to join East Bengal.         
	Sources also revealed that the argument put forth by the duo for leaving Mahindra United was quite unconvincing. The two players have argued that they didnt get food of their own choice during their tenure with Mahindra United. Mahindra have already rejected their argument and have asked the two players to honour their contract with the club.

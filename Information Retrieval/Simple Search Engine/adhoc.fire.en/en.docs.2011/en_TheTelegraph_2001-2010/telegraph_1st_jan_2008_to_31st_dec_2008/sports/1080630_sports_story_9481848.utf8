The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolt stays fastest
                                                                                                                                                                                           Bolt stays fastest
                      
	Kingston: World 100 metres record holder Usain Bolt defeated his closest rival Asafa Powell to qualify for the Beijing Olympics on Saturday, but his coach remained tight-lipped about whether he will run in the prestige event.         
	In what had been billed as the clash of the worlds two fastest men, Bolt ran 9.85 to finish first in Jamaicas Olympic trials, while Powell, the former record holder, clocked 9.97 seconds.         
	Bolt took the world record from Powell last month when he lowered the mark to 9.72 at the Reebok Grand Prix in New York.         
	Michael Frater secured the third berth on the Jamaican team for Beijing with his run of 10.04 seconds.         
	Local fans had hoped for a close battle between their two heroes but Bolt let up in the final five metres with his victory secure. I had been telling everyone that it wouldnt be a clash, Bolt said.         
	We just came to qualify for the Olympics. But in the end I guess the crowd was a little bit disappointed with this but, actually, I did tell them.         
	Bolt will run in the 200 metres, his favoured discipline, in which he claimed silver at last years World Championships.         
	It is hard to imagine Bolt not running in 100 in China but his coach Glen Mills again declined to reveal his plans.         
	There is no decision yet and there wont be until August, Mills said.         
	But Powells coach Stephen Francis said he was certainly expecting rival Bolt to be lining up in the shortest race. Why not? We assume he will be there, he said.         
	World womens 100m champion Veronica Campbell-Brown failed to qualify for that event after finishing fourth on Saturday.         
	Campbell-Brown missed out on qualification by just a 0.01 seconds, finishing fourth.           (REUTERS)

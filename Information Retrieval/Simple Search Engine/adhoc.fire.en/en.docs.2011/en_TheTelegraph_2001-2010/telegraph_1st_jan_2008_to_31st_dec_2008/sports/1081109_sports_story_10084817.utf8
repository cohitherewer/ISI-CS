The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indias tactics worked: Katich
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indias tactics worked: Katich
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Simon Katich wasnt a happy man at the end of the day despite racking up his fifth Test century. One cant be after taking 100 minutes to score 10 runs.         
	Katich did not criticise the Indian plan to employ an 8-1 field in the opening session on the third day of the fourth Test on Saturday but still expressed his unhappiness at the way things have gone for the Australians in the series-decider.         
	You are kidding me, are you not? We were defensive with an 8-1 field? You obviously dont understand the game, was the left-handers response when a reporter asked him about the visitors slow batting.         
	Subsequently, when a visiting reporter asked him to elaborate how he and partner Michael Hussey had planned to counter the Indians he said they had preferred to take it session by session.         
	Huss and I were pretty content to try and wait it out. And then review it later in the day. Unfortunately that didnt happen with both of us getting out, he said.         
	Indias tactics, however, did not surprise Katich.         
	No, not at all. They know they dont have to win the Test, he said. It is a good strategy if you can execute it. If you dont get it right, you can pay the price but they executed it well.         
	Katich was seen talking to Aleem Dar after being ruled out leg before wicket to Zaheer Khan. He said that it had nothing to do with his being unhappy about the decision.         
	The Aussie opener said the visitors were looking at chasing a target of 300 on the final day.         
	Looking at the tactics today, we have to keep them to around 300 on the last day. We have to bowl well tomorrow and take our chances, he said.         
	We had them in trouble in the first innings at 100 for three. Unfortunately, we could not do damage to the middle order. So hopefully tomorrow we can keep chipping away consistently.

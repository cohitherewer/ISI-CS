The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ take charge on first day
                                                NZ take charge on first day
                      
	Dunedin: Matthew Bell scored an unbeaten half-century in his first Test appearance in more than six years to ram home New Zealands advantage over Bangladesh on Day I of the first Test on Friday.         
	Bell made 74 not out to help the Black Caps recover from a slow start and reach stumps on 156 for four in reply to Bangladeshs miserable first innings total of 137.         
	New Zealand seamer Chris Martin captured four wickets and all-rounder Jacob Oram three as the tourists were all out before tea at the University Oval, which is hosting a Test for the first time.         
	The Black Caps lost four early wickets in their reply but Bell ensured they finished the day with a useful 19-run lead and six wickets in hand.         
	Martin dismissed Junaid Siddique (1), Habibul Bashar (23) and Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful for a golden duck in his first spell before removing teenage opener Tamin Iqbal for 53 after lunch.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal leaps to tied 19th
                      
	Richmond: Arjun Atwal returned the days best card of six-under 66 to leap to the tied 19th spot after the penultimate round of the $ 500,000 Henrico County Open on the nationwide tour here.         
	The Orlando-based golfer has a total of eight-under 208 at the Dominion Club.         
	A 10th tee starter, Atwal was off to a good start as he birdied the opening hole before picking up three more shots on the 13th, 15th and 18th to make the turn four-under.         
	His front nine was turning out to be even better as he struck a hattrick of birdies from fourth to sixth before a lone bogey on the seventh came as a dampener.         
	At the top, Canadian Bryan Decorso and American Matt Hansen carded identical 66s to share the lead at 14-under 202.         
	Meanwhile, at the Byron Nelson Championship in Irving, Australias Adam Scott extended his lead to three shots Saturday to stand on the verge of a first PGA Tour victory in more than a year.         
	The world No. 10 began the third round with a one-shot cushion and was able to stretch his advantage by a further two strokes after firing a three-under par 67, moving to eight under.         
	The Australian capitalised on two sublime chip shots to birdie the par-five 16th and par-four closing hole as he ended his round with a flourish. (PTI)

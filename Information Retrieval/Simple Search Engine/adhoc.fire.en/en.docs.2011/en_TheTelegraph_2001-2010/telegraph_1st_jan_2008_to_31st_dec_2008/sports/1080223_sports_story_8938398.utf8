                                                     IPL a real danger: Ponting 
    - Opinion divided over multi million-dollar extravaganza             A STAFF REPORTER             Ricky Ponting                                 
	Calcutta: Australian captain Ricky Ponting fears the Indian Premier League (IPL) could threaten to spoil the composition of national sides, blaming the International Cricket Council for not acting in time to develop the Twenty20 format to its potential.         
	With the amount of money being freely paid for cricketers around the world, there is a real danger that some guys will find the IPL more attractive than playing for their countries, Ponting wrote in his column for The Australian on Friday.         
	Even with Australian players, who are among the best paid in the world, there could come a point where they look at someone such as Adam Gilchrist, who has retired and just signed a big contract with the IPL, and see him earn all that for a couple of months cricket.         
	Making more money and spending most of the year with your family by playing in the IPL could start to look pretty attractive to some. And if there are potential stars of Test or one-day cricket who might have any sort of thoughts like that, I think it is really dangerous for the game, Ponting said.         
	If the ICC is saying it cant find a window for the IPL, then those running the game will have to be careful how they handle this Twenty20 phenomenon. The amount of money being bandied around here and the amount of money and power the Indian board, the BCCI, has, who knows how cricket administration worldwide is going to pan out.         
	Ponting also has a dig at his teammate Andrew Symonds, who has emerged the second costliest after Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the auction. Theres always chiacking going on among the players, so with something like this its too good an opportunity not to have a dig. Of course Symonds, as the highest-paid among us in the IPL, has copped the brunt of it. Hes our new million-dollar man. We were asking him about body guards and that sort of stuff.         
	We were playing a game of touch footy out on the MCG to warm up before training in preparation for the game against Sri Lanka and there were a few high balls he missed. He jumped up but couldnt reach them so we reckon his pockets were too full and he couldnt leap high enough, he wrote.         
	The Australian captain, however, pointed out that the ICC should have cashed in on the Twenty20 formats potentiality much earlier.         
	Twenty20 cricket has been big at domestic level for most of this decade in England, then South Africa and now Australia. It was obvious by the crowds at that level that it was going to be big. If the ICC had jumped on it then and developed Twenty20 cricket instead of trying to keep a lid on it then there might not have been any need for an IPL to counter the rebel Indian Cricket League, Ponting remarked.

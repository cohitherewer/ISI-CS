	London: Maria Sharapova, the 2004 singles champion who has wowed Centre Court with diamond-encrusted outfits and frilly dresses, said she is more comfortable in simple gear.         
	While practising at the All England Club she teased fans by saying: Im going to be debuting a new look.         
	Im going with the traditional shorts, believe it or not, she said. Ive never worn shorts at a Grand Slam. Call it menswear, obviously. Its kind of a tuxedo look, very simple lines, classic.         
	Sharapova has enjoyed a return to her best form this year after winning her third Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.         
	Her first Wimbledon match will be against Stephanie Foretz, a qualifier from France. Foretz is ranked in the top 100, but has a poor track record on grass.         
	Despite not being the top seed  that honour has gone to world number one Serbian Ana Ivanovic, 20,  bookmakers have named Sharapova their tournament favourite.         
	While there has been no let up in the demand for tickets  which cost up to 91  the credit crunch has taken its toll on the price of strawberries.         
	A punnet containing at least 10 strawberries has risen for the first time in five years  up 25 pence to 2.25.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

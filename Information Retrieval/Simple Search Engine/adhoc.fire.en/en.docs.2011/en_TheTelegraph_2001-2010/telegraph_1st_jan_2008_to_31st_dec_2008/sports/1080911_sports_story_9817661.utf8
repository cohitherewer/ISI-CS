                                                                                                                                                                                             Russia beat Wales 2-1
    - WORLD CUP QUALIFIERS                 Action during Russia-Wales match on Wednesday                           
	Moscow: Goals from strikers Roman Pavlyuchenko and Pavel Pogrebnyak gave Russia a 2-1 win over Wales in their World Cup group 4 qualifier on Wednesday while Australia opened their campaign in the fourth round of Asian World Cup qualifying with a 1-0 win at Tashkent that ended Uzbekistans formidable run at home.         
	Russia went ahead in the 22nd minute when Pavlyuchenko fired into the roof of the net from the spot after midfielder Carl Robinson brought down Konstantin Zyryanov in the box.         
	Wales had squandered the chance to take the lead five minutes before that when Pavlyuchenkos Tottenham Hotspur team mate Gareth Bale had his penalty well saved by Igor Akinfeyevs acrobatic dive to the right.         
	Defender Bale made amends for the miss midway through the second half when he set up the equaliser, running through two defenders and crossing from the right to allow Joe Ledley to slot in with his left foot.         
	Forward Andrei Arshavin showed the sort of dangerous edge he displayed to help Russia reach the Euro 2008 semi-finals, crossing in from the left after a nifty run down the flank and finding Zyryanov in the box.         
	Zyryanovs header was palmed away by Wayne Hennessey into the path of Pogrebnyak, whose scorching left-footed shot had the Welsh keeper well beaten.         
	It was Russias first match of the qualifying campaign for the 2010 finals in South Africa and the second game for Wales after a 1-0 home win over Azerbaijan.         
	Scott Chipperfield scored in the 26th minute to silence the 35,000-strong crowd at Pakhtakor Stadium a.         
	Uzbekistan had not lost a World Cup qualifying match at home since 2001 and had only conceded one goal in nine previous qualifiers on home soil.

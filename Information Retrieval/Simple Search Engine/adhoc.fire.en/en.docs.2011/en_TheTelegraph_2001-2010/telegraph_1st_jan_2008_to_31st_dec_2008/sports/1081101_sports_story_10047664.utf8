	New Delhi: Indian captain Anil Kumble had a couple of stitches on the little finger of his left hand, which he injured while fielding here on Friday.         
	Kumble injured his hand in the 53rd over while attempting to take a catch. He was then fielding at short mid-wicket. He was rushed to the Apollo Hospital and did not take the field again.         
	Kumble received a deep cut on his little finger, said a team official. It was not confirmed whether the veteran spinner would take the field on the fourth day.         
	It all depends on how he feels, the official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussie media back Hayden
                                                   Aussie media back Hayden
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket Australias move to reprimand Matthew Hayden drew sharp criticism from the Australian media on Wednesday, with two newspapers calling the censure kow-towing before India  crickets new superpowers.         
	The Australian said, the summer of discontent is in danger of spilling over into civil war and that India are the worst behaved team in the world.         
	The newspaper said frustrated Australian players are angry at what they perceive as lack of support from the board. Frustrated Australian players are already angry at what they believe has been a lack of support for Andrew Symonds and Ricky Ponting, in particular, when CA moved to downgrade a racial abuse charge against Harbhajan last month.         
	They are annoyed that CA continues to kow-tow to a constantly threatening and whining BCCI despite India maintaining their reputation as the worst behaved team in the world.         
	The report said Haydens comments were foolish.         
	Named one-day player of the year and second in the Allan Border Medal during Tuesday nights dinner, Hayden foolishly said on Brisbane radio before the presentation what many in the team think about Harbhajan.         
	While it was meant to be a light-hearted FM radio interview promoting poor ticket sales for the second one-day final in Brisbane on Tuesday, Haydens lack of diplomacy has poured petrol on a bushfire and has given the Indians something substantial to complain about.         
	The Daily Telegraph, said Hayden was charged for simply saying what most Australians feel. Hayden was charged for simply saying what most Australians feel about Harbhajan Singh. Yet here we have another classic case of the big wigs at CA trying to stop players from expressing their opinions.         
	The newspaper said theres nothing wrong with calling Harbhajan an obnoxious little weed.         
	What is wrong with calling Harby an obnoxious little weed? Its not racist, its not all that rude and its certainly not bad for the game. Its clear these two sides dont like each other so why should they pretend otherwise.         
	In no other sport are competitors muzzled like our cricketers. Most sports, like rugby league, soccer and AFL, thrive on controversy. Its part of the game and fans love it.         
	Peter Roebuck, a columnist with The Australian, deplored haydens rude remarks and said it was high time the home team improved its behaviour. Well, they (the comments on Harbhajan) were a bit rude. The young man is a guest in the country and must be treated with hospitality, he said.         
	 I think they are pretty fed up with Harbhajan particularly, and I am not sure why Hayden felt the need to say that publicly, Roebuck told an Indian news channel.

     RAVI SHASTRI      
	I am a righthanded batsman. Whenever I come down the wicket I end up getting bowled. Please help.              
	(Hemant Prasad, 16, Dhanbad)              
	Watch the ball. Make sure you get close to the pitch of the ball when going down the track.              
	 I am a leg-spinner. What should be the ideal length for pitching the ball when bowling against a righthanded batsman?              
	(Md Idrees, 19, Barrackpore)              
	A length where you draw him forward and make him reach out for the ball.               
	 I am an allrounder. Should I concentrate only on physical conditioning during the off season?              
	(Amit Chakraborty, 21)              
	Not a bad idea. Its good to take a break once in a while.              
	 I am a batsman. I always struggle to get back into nick after the off season. How do I avoid it this time?              
	(Sanjit Mehra, 19, Calcutta)              
	Get into the nets earlier so that you get back some touch.              
	I often get bowled when attempting the sweep against a leg-spinner. Please help.              
	(Ramen Tarafdar, 17, Calcutta-78)               
	Go towards the line of the ball with your front foot.               
	I am a righthanded batsman. Often I am out hit wicket when trying to defend a bouncer. Please help.              
	(Rajat Mohanta, 21, Rajgongpur, Orissa)              
	Watch the ball and use the depth of the crease so that you stay balanced.              
	I am a leg-spinner. Whenever I try to bowl a faster delivery I end up bowling wide or full toss. Why does this happen?               
	(Vivek Dhar, 19, Calcutta-7)               
	Stick to the basics like keeping a still head and watching the spot you want the ball to land.              
	I am a lefthanded batsman. Often while offering a defensive shot to a left-arm spinner I get caught at silly point. Why does this happen?              
	(Samesh Chakraborty, 18, Calcutta-15)              
	Get into the habit of playing with the bat in front of the pads and not behind it.              
	On a turning track, is it wise to use more of the pad than the bat against spinners?              
	(Rohit Roy, 19, Calcutta-41)               
	Always good you use the bat as often as possible.              
	How does one improve slip catching? Will only practice help?              
	(Samit Sharma, 21, Calcutta-84)              
	It demands a lot of practice as its a specialist position. Get into the habit where you take 50 catches everytime you go out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara: Federer has that something extra
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sangakkara: Federer has that something extra
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kumar Sangakkara                           
	Karachi: Senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar isnt the only one who had to choose between cricket and tennis. Kumar Sangakkara had to make the same choice.         
	The difference, of course, is that Sachin did so around a decade earlier  after Indias World Cup win in 1983.         
	I was 16 or thereabouts when a reality check had to be done I realised I wasnt good enough to really make it big in tennis and, so, decided to concentrate on cricket, Sangakkara, the dashing Sri Lankan vice-captain, told The Telegraph.         
	He added: I grew up following the Boris Becker-Stefan Edberg rivalry Following the closing stages of the Martina Navratilova-Chris Evert rivalry Later, I followed Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Pete Sampras Today, I just love the way Roger Federer plays Nobody wants to be a loser, but Federer has that something extra         
	Grinning, Sangakkara hoped that Federer would again win at Big W, making it an awesome double hattrick. Hes already in the semi-finals.         
	Asked whether he had a favourite among the women players, Sangakkara quipped: Not really Its best to watch womens tennis You dont have to have a favourite!         
	Incidentally, Sangakkaras elder sister, Saranga, was Sri Lankas national champion at 16. She couldve gone places, but a rotator cuff injury forced her to stop playing, he remarked.

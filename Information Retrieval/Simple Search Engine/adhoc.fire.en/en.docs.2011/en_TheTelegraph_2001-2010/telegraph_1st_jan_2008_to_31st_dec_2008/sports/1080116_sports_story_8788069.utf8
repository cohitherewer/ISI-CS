                                                   Lifetime ban for fixing

           
	Melbourne: Any female tennis player found guilty of match-fixing will be given a lifetime ban from the sport, the head of womens tennis said on Tuesday. 
    
	Larry Scott, the chairman and CEO of the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour, confirmed that several players have been approached to alter the outcome of a match, and said that the battle against gambling was as important as the fight against doping. 
    
	There will be a lifetime ban if any player is associated with match-fixing, Scott said in an interview. 
    
	We have to treat it with the utmost seriousness like that. Were treating it in a similar way (as doping), as evidenced by the fact that were working together, all the governing bodies, like we do with doping. 
    
	Were going to have to apply some significant resources and work with outsiders to make sure (we have the right) policing, investigating, and that we have very stringent rules. 
    
	Several male players say they have been approached to fix matches, while three Italians  Potito Starace, Daniele Bracciali and Alessio Di Mauro  all received bans for betting on matches.

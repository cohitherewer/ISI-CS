The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kapil wants Sunny to carry on writing
                                                   Kapil wants Sunny to carry on writing
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Kapil Dev wants Sunil Gavaskar to continue wearing the columnist and TV commentators hat even though the International Cricket Council (ICC) is keen to see the iconic former India opener out as chairman of its prestigious cricket committee.         
	The games world governing body has taken strong exception to Gavaskars stand, both on TV and through his columns, during Team Indias recent tour of Australia.         
	Kapil, however, insisted that Gavaskar shouldnt deny millions of readers of his valuable comments in newspapers and on TV.         
	I dont know how Gavaskar is bound by the ICC contracts. But I, like millions of his admirers, dont want to see him stop writing or commentating on TV.         
	Sunil, please keep on writing so that we can get valuable tips from you, Kapil said during a news conference at a city hotel on Thursday, also introducing actor Mithun Chakraborty as co-owner of the ICL team, Kolkata Tigers.         
	Kapil has also described those opposing the ICL as traitors, saying that the players plying trade in the new venture must get a chance to represent the country at the international level.         
	I would like to ask the BCCI one simple question: Am I doing something wrong? Are these boys who play in the ICL not Indians? They all aspire to play for the country. Why shouldnt you allow them? Are we not going back by 200 years?, Kapil, chairman of the ICL, asked.         
	If anybody, be it any person or organisation, says the ICL players cant play for India, Ill call him a traitor, the 1983 World Cup-winning captain added.         
	About Jagmohan Dalmiyas stand-off with the current BCCI dispensation, Kapil said: I dont know about the court cases, but he has served the Indian cricket for long.         
	Will Dalmiya join the ICL? Our hands are stretched to embrace anybody, was Kapils parting shot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ric in Hall of Fame
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ric in Hall of Fame
                      
	Melbourne: Legendary hockey player Ric Charlesworth has been inducted into the inaugural hall of fame of Hockey Australia.         
	Charlesworth, presently at loggerheads with his Indian employers, is one of the 22 inductees, including 11 female recipients, whom Hockey Australia honoured on the eve of the 2008 Beijing Olympics at the Perth convention and exhibition centre.         
	The Hockey Australia Hall of Fame has been established to formally recognise those who have achieved excellence in the international arena and, by their achievements, significantly enhanced the image of the sport. Richard Aggiss, a member of the Hall of Fame selection committee, said the committee found it difficult to select only 22 recipients.         
	Selection was a difficult but exciting process  reviewing the history of the game going back to the early 1900s and comparing those players against the current era made selection a tough task, he said.         
	Aggiss also said the present inductees are those who retired before year 2000 and also promised to induct deserving candidates in future.         
	Given the enormous success over the last number of years and to best represent all eras of Australian hockey, it was decided to limit the initial group of inductees to those players and officials who retired from international hockey prior to 2000, Aggiss said.         
	I look forward to adding more names to the Hall of Fame from the modern era on a regular basis, he said.         
	Each Hall of Fame inductee received a custom-minted solid silver medallion struck by Perth mint.

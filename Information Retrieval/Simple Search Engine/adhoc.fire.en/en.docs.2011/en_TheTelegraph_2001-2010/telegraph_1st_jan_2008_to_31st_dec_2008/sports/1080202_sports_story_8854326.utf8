	Durban: A career-best 43 off 21 balls from Jerome Taylor boosted the West Indies to a defendable total of 263 for nine in the fourth one-day International against South Africa on Friday. 
    
	Tail-ender Taylor smashed an unbeaten 43 with five fours and two sixes after the visitors won the toss and chose to bat. 
    
	Taylor, whose previous best score was 13 against Sri Lanka in 2006-07, shared 57 runs for the unbroken 10th wicket with Fidel Edwards (12 not out). 
    
	The last pair helped West Indies recover after their middle-order squandered the solid start made by Brenton Parchment and Sewnarine Chattergoon, who put on 97 for the first wicket. 
    
	The West Indian openers, who scored 48 each, gathered runs comfortably until the 24th over, when Chattergoon drove at a delivery from medium-pacer Shaun Pollock and was caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. 
    
	Parchment was trapped in front by fast bowler Andre Nel 11 balls later. 
    
	West Indies lost their next four wickets for 67 runs to dwindle to 167 for six in the 41st over. 
    
	Patrick Browne, who hit three fours and two sixes in his 24, and Rawl Lewis (15) bolstered the West Indians with their partnership of 33 runs off 17 balls for the seventh wicket. 
    
	West Indies were 206 for nine when Edwards joined Taylor in the 45th over and suddenly the runs began to flow. In the process, Ntini conceded 80 runs off his nine overs, the most expensive one-day analysis by a South African. 
    
	The previous record was held by fast bowler Jacques Kallis, who went for 70 runs in the six overs he bowled against Australia in Johannesburg in 2005-06.

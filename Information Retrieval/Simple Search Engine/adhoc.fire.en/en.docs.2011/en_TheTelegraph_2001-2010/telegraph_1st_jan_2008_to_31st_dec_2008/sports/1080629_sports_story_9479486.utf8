                                                                                                                                                                                                     Laxmi wants to do Level A coaching
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Top Bengal cricketers, including state Ranji team captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, have expressed their desire to take part in the six-day BCCI Level A Coaching Camp, scheduled to be held from July 8-13, CAB joint secretary Amitava Banerjee said on Saturday.         
	The Ranji players will be given first preference during screening for the camp, Banerjee told reporters. Around 30 people will be selected for the camp, which will be conducted by NCA, director operations, Dav Whatmore. Sourashis Lahiri and Charanjeet Singh were the other players who accompanied Shukla.         
	Shukla however, denied that he had any aspirations to become a coach as of now.         
	Its for my own betterment. You can learn a lot from these camps, Shukla told The Telegraph. I have no intention of becoming a coach. I can improve my captaincy skills, batting and game as a whole from the fine-tuning I receive. I can learn video analysis and thus improve overall.

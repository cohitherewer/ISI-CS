	Cincinnati: Novak Djokovic handed No.1-in-waiting Rafael Nadal his first defeat in nearly three months, stunning the Spaniard 6-1, 7-5 to reach the final of the Cincinnati Masters. The Serbian third seed snapped a 32-match win streak for Nadal, who was last defeated on May 7 by compatriot and former No.1 Juan Carlos Ferrero in Rome, with Nadal suffering from foot blisters on Saturday.

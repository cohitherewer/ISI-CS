            A STAFF REPORTER                                
	Calcutta: After Fridays derby draw, that saw East Bengal finish the Sahara CFL Premier Division at third place with 25 points from 14 games the tell tale signs of fatigue and frustration were showing on coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee.         
	Speaking to the media after the match, Manoranjan gave the biggest hint that he may be stepping down as East Bengal coach before the start of the I-League. He said, I havent yet heard the rumours of a foreign coach replacing me, but I can tell you this much that I have given a verbal hint to the club officials, expressing my desire to step down.         
	He added soon after that the decision is likely to be announced on Sunday, after he hands in a written request to the club. It has been learnt that Stanley Rozario, Bob Houghtons assistant in the national set-up is most likely to take the helm at East Bengal.         
	While offering his congratulations to league champions Mohun Bagan, Manoranjan slammed the refereeing, claiming his side should have been awarded a penalty, if not two.         
	Manju had handled the ball in the box and the foul on Ashim, early in the match should have been a penalty too.Manoranjan went on to list four second leg matchesagainst Railway FC, Mohammedan Sporting, Camellia George Telegraph and Fridays game against his own sidewhere Mohun Bagan were saved thanks to the referee.         
	Karim Bencharifa seemed a contented man, having delivered in his first challenge after coming to Calcutta. He said: It wasnt easyWe were under great pressure from the media, opponents and weighed down by the expectations of our fansBut weve proved today that we deserve respect from all quarters.         
	Speaking about his teams preparations shrouded by off the pitch drama on the eve of the big clash, Bencharifa quipped, Everything was going against us. We were without Deepak (Mondal), Habibur and Peter (Odafe). Bhaichung and Mohan Raj hadnt trained and young Rino Anto was low on confidence. But I had told the players before the match that we all either do or die together.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raikkonen toasts life in fast lane 
                                                   Raikkonen toasts life in fast lane

	Kimi Raikkonens face turned the colour of his shirt. It was a quintessential Australian welcome, delivered in the region of the groin. Kimi, binge drinking is a very topical issue in Australia. Youre renowned for liking a drink. How do you manage that within the demands of being a Formula One racing driver?         
	Cue smoke from the ears of the Ferrari press office. No team in the paddock is more sensitive to public opinion. No fair dinkum Aussie gives a hoot about what people think. This clash of cultures produced the comic exchange of the week.         
	I live as I always have been living. Like any of my people, I like to go out. I dont see any problems with it, the Finn said. Like a dog with a bone his inquisitor would not let go. But how do you manage it? Do you abstain during the season and then hit it pretty hard at the end?         
	Raikkonen responded: I do what I want. Im not responsible for telling people what I do off the track. I dont need to explain it. So far it seems to be working pretty well, so theres no reason to change it.         
	Raikkonen was a guest of Ferrari sponsor Shell, who have come to use the Melbourne race as a key component of their marketing platform. It certainly oiled media wheels.         
	Increasingly F1 teams guard against the possibility of a booby trap by banning questions that might cause offence. Inquiries about Fernando Alonso or Swiss addresses are not welcome at McLaren. Questions about Lewis Hamilton are off limits on Alonsos side of the Renault garage.         
	Thankfully, the concept of censorship has yet to make it to Australia.         
	Not that Ferrari nor Raikkonen have anything to fear. The idea that the world champion might crack a bottle of bubbly or sink a few beers in celebration hardly offends right thinking F1 folk. Is not the draining of a magnum of Moet a central part of podium protocol?         
	If expert opinion is any guide, it could be another heavy weekend for the Finn. Raikkonen is short odds to repeat the victory he recorded in Australia last year on his Ferrari debut.         
	The Ferrari was consistently fast in winter testing and Raikkonen has the benefit of a season with the team and a world title under his belt. It follows, therefore, that the Raikkonen proposition has not got any weaker.         
	Coming to this new season it is, hopefully, going to be more easy going, he said. The first part of the season especially should be easier than it was last year.         
	The outcome at Melbourne in 2007 masked a problematic start to his Ferrari career. Teammate Felipe Massa proved the quicker of the two in succeeding races as Raikkonen struggled to master the rhythm of his new car. It was not until the season reached North America that Raikkonen began to trust his new machinery.         
	In the first part of 2007 it looked like the championship was getting away from me again, he said.

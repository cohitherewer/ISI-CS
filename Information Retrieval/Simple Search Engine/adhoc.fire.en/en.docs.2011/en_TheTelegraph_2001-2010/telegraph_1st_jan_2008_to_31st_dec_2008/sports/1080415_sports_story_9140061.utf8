	Warne advice for visiting teams   
	Jaipur: Instead of cribbing about the turning tracks in India, visiting teams should learn to play on them as there is nothing wrong in the host sides insistence on having wickets that work to their advantage, feels Australian spin legend Shane Warne. Here to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the Rajasthan Royals, Warne said visiting teams should come prepared for turners. I see nothing wrong. Every team visiting India expects such kind of wickets. Dont the Indians have to play on hard and bouncy wickets in Australia or South Africa? That is the whole fun in cricket. You have to play on different kind of surfaces and have to prove yourself on them. It is a great challenge, he added.

	Asif selected         
	 Karachi: Pakistans pace spearhead Mohammed Asif was on Monday drafted into the national squad for the fourth ODI against Bangladesh after spending six months on the sidelines due to a chronic elbow problem. The national selection committee included him in a 16-member squad announced for the one-dayer to be played on Wednesday in Multan. The selectors have also included young pacers Kamran Hussain and Wahab Riaz in the squad.         
	No rift: Malik         
	 Karachi: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik has rejected suggestions that senior batsman Younis Khan leaving the side midway through the one-day series against Bangladesh was indicative of an internal rift in the team. Younis had some personal engagements and he took leave after informing me, the team manager and the board. There is nothing else to his being released from the squad, Malik said.         
	PCB gag         
	 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has turned a blind eye to ICCs standard procedures by refusing to allow the teams leading performer of the day in the ODI series against Bangladesh to take media queries. A PCB spokesman said the players are not being allowed for the post match press conferences because the board wants to avoid controversies.

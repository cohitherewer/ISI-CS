The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chowrasia suffers Day One blues
                                                     Chowrasia suffers Day One blues
  - Indian Masters champion in 51st spot; Randhawa tied 3rd       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jyoti Randhawa                                 
	Noida: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia was nowhere near his best at the Jaypee Greens here on Wednesday.         
	Back in action after his sensational victory in the Indian Masters, the Calcutta-based golfer had a relatively quiet outing on the first day of the SAIL Open with an even-par 72 that placed him in the 51st place with 23 others.         
	The group included Gaurav Ghei, Amandeep Johl, Harmeet Kahlon and youngsters Anirban Lahiri and Rahul Ganapathy.         
	On a warm and sunny day, Scotsman Ross Bain and Australian Tony Carolan carded a six-under-par 66 each to soar into lead in the $400,000 tournament.         
	Local hero Jyoti Randhawa, the local favourite, blasted a five-under 67 to be tied third with Australians Scott Hend, Peter Cooke, Adam Groom, Singapore s Lam Chih Bing and Fijian Dinesh Chand.         
	Chowrasia, who attracted maximum attention, was obviously unhappy with his own showing.         
	My hitting and putting were not up to the mark today, said Chowrasia, whose day was blighted by birdies on the eighth and the ninth.         
	I paid the penalty for landing my strokes in the bunker on the eighth and ninth but then came back well with birdies on the 17th and 18th, the ace golfer said. This course is unlike the one at the Delhi Golf Club.         
	But this is only the beginning. Things should be much better in the next couple of days, he said.         
	Randhawa, who started the day on the 10th hole, began brightly.         
	He almost drove the green on the short 354 yards par four and was just 10 feet out of the green when he decided to use the putter and holed it.         
	He then sank birdies on the 13th and 18th holes to be four under at the turn. Thereafter, he birdied the second and the seventh, but dropped a shot on the ninth.         
	I went into the left trees and came out pretty well, but missed a short five-foot putt for par, he said.         
	It was a good start, but disappointing to finish with a bogey on the ninth, said Randhawa, who loves to hit the ball long and had a clear edge at the Jaypee Greens, regarded a drivers delight.         
	As for the course Well, when you feel a little disappointed after shooting a five-under, that says all about the course.         
	The highlight of the day came right at the start with that eagle two.         
	I drove to just about 10 feet short of the green and then decided to putt from there and it dropped.         
	Things (score) could have been better but I missed a few short ones of about four to five feet, said Randhawa.         
	Behind Randhawa, the next best Indian was Dinesh Kumar, who brought home a 68 to lie in tied ninth spot.

  - Mumbai Indians placed sixth with eight points from as many games                       
	Mumbai: Riding Sanath Jayasuriyas unbeaten knock of 114, that included 11 sixes and ten fours, Mumbai Indians outclassed Chennai Super Kings by nine wickets for their fourth straight win after four losses in the Indian Premier League here Wednesday.         
	The Sri Lankan veteran flicked, slashed and pulled the short-pitched balls served to him on a platter by the visiting teams bowlers as the home team, chasing Chennais total of 156 for six, surged to a comprehensive win in only the 14th over.         
	Jayasuriya finished the match with a flourish by slamming Lankan compatriot Chamara Kapugedara for 26 runs in five balls, with three sixes to boot.         
	Mumbai Indians are placed sixth with eight points from as many games. They take on Kolkata Knight Riders on Friday, who have 10 points from nine games.         
	It was the marauder from Matara who stole the honours with clean hitting as he took the match away in the first six overs when 78 runs were made. He raced away to his fifty in 25 balls and his hundred came from just 45 balls, studded with seven fours and 10 sixes.         
	Jayasuriya and fit-again Mumbai Indians skipper Sachin Tendulkar, who made 12 in 16 balls with a six and a four, put on 82 for the first wicket in only 44 balls to condemn the visitors to a comprehensive defeat, their fourth in 10 games.         
	Tendulkar was out in the eighth over, bowled through the gate by Joginder Sharma when the champion batsman tried to play an on-drive, but Jayasuriya carried on relentlessly to ensure that the home team came out victorious.         
	Chennai new ball bowlers Manpreet Singh Gony and South African Albie Morkel erred in trying to bounce out the great left-hander on a helpful pitch but just did not possess the much-needed accuracy and went for plenty.         
	Gony went for 31 in his first three while Morkel conceded a whopping 44 from the same number of overs. Jayasuriya struck three sixes each in one over from both the pacers.         
	The Lankan aces initial pyrotechnics sealed Chennais fate much before the end came.         
	Earlier, Subramaniam Badrinath and Mahendra Singh Dhoni revived the visitors with a 95-run stand after the hosts pace attack had taken early control.         
	Badrinath, struggling initially before picking up pace, struck his second successive half century in the IPL when he made 53 off 32 balls with seven fours and two sixes while Dhoni made an unbeaten 43 in 35 balls with six fours and a six. The fifth wicket pair pulled Chennai out of the hole with their near-century stand in 61 balls.         
	The recovery came after the Mumbai Indians pace attack put them on the rack to leave them gasping at 46 for four in the ninth over as the duo mixed authentic and streaky shots.         
	Put in to bat, Chennai began well by hitting a string of boundaries in the second over before being rocked by the Mumbai attack to be pushed on the back foot.         
	Stephen Fleming (26), dropped on one, and fellow-opener Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan (16) got a start but failed to flourish to the full.         
	Suresh raina made only one run before edging a rising ball from Dwayne Bravo to keeper Yogesh Takawale to leave Chennai at 28 for two in the sixth over.           (PTI)

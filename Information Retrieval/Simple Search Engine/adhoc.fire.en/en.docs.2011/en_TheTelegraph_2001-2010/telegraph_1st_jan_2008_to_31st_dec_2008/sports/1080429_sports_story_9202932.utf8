The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coach hopes to cash in on Bhajji absence
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Coach hopes to cash in on Bhajji absence
  - Im sure Ponting will be determined to sign off on a positive note, says John Buchanan       SUDIPTO CHOWDHURY                            
	Calcutta: A two-and-half hour closed-door meeting summed up Kolkata Knight Riders preparations for Tuesdays Indian Premier League (IPL) encounter against the Mumbai Indians at the Eden.         
	It was learnt that the meeting, also attended by captain Sourav Ganguly, focused exclusively on what the strategy should be to prevent the loss of early wickets, a highly placed source said.         
	Coach John Buchanan preferred resting his players. They need rest That will help them perform better on Tuesday.         
	The 55-year old Australian however, rated Mumbai Indians as a powerful side.         
	In Twenty20, previous results (four losses) hardly matter. It doesnt indicate that they are weak Mumbai, I feel, are a very, very powerful side. They have fairly good chance of winning with explosive batsmen in the form of Jayasuriya, Ashwell and good bowlers in Bravo and Pollock, Buchanan said.         
	Mumbai, who on Sunday lost to Deccan Chargers by 10 wickets, will miss the services of spinner Harbhajan Singh. Skipper Sachin Tendulkars chances also seem quite dim. Sundays loss was their fourth on trot.         
	Buchanan felt that Harbhajans absence would make a difference. He is a very good and skilful player Its a big loss for Mumbai. His absence will definitely be felt.         
	Buchanan hinted at a possible change in the playing XI. Pakistan pacer Umar Gul, who arrived last week, has been included in the 13-man squad in place of teenage spinner Iqbal Abdullah.         
	The final XI will be announced only after we reach the ground and check the wicket. I feel it will be the same XI. But we have decided to make one change in the 13-member squad. Gul comes in place of Iqbal, the Knight Riders coach said. Michael has seen Gul He is in good shape, he added.         
	Asked whether Ricky Pontings lean patch will bother the team, Buchanan expressed his faith on the Australian captains ability to bounce back.         
	Its unfortunate. In the practice sessions, Ricky was middling the ball exceptionally well. He was seeing the ball and hitting it perfectly. I am sure he is very determined to do well in this since it is his last match and he will try to put a decent score on board, Buchanan said.         
	Ponting will be playing his last IPL match on Tuesday before leaving for Australia, who are scheduled to play a three-Test series in the West Indies. New Zealand wicketkeeper-batsman Brendon McCullum will also be playing his last IPL tie of this season. He will join the Black Caps who will be touring England from Friday.         
	He was full of praise for his middle-order  Bengal skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Wriddhiman Saha.         
	About the Eden pitch, which came under scanner after the first IPL match on April 20, Buchanan seemed comfortable.         
	I havent looked at it. But those who have seen it told me that it had a good grass covering on it Hope it has consistent pace and bounce throughout the game. And anything around 180 or 200 plus will be a competitive score.         
	Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians coach Lalchand Rajput, after arriving in the city late on Monday evening, said that the final XI would be decided after looking at the wicket on Tuesday.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, meanwhile, will undergo a fitness test on Tuesday. He is getting better. The physio will take the decision after consulting him, said Rajput.

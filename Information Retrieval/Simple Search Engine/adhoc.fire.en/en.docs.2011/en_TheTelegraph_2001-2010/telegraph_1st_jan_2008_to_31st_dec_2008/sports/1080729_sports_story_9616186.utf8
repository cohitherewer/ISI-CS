                                                                                                                                                                                                       Far from the madding crowd
    - With Eden as the prize, big fight is today             A STAFF REPORTER            B.N. Dutt                                 
	Calcutta: Biswanath Dutt may not hold as much clout as he once did, but remains an important figure in Maidan politics. It has been more of a forced decision to keep himself out of the limelight  mainly due to ill health and advancing age.         
	Seeking the blessings of the former CAB and BCCI president still remains part of a ritual for most candidates. The script hasnt changed one bit this time, but Dutt is not taking sides.         
	Even as the CAB has been bustling with activity, Dutt has preferred to restrict himself to the confines of his Bhowanipore residence. Visitors have been dropping in and out, but he has remained non-committal.         
	Ive nothing to do with the CAB elections. Both (Jagmohan) Dalmiya and Samar (Paul) had come to me, but Ive nothing to say. Im not rooting for anyone. I clearly told them that I would talk on everything except the CAB elections, Dutt told The Telegraph.         
	Is he happy with the way the CAB has been functioning under Prasun Mukherjee? No comments, came the stern reply.         
	Dutt has maintained a stoic silence since he decided not to contest against Prasun Mukherjee for the presidents post early last year. Dutt had initially offered to take charge in that hour of crisis once Dalmiya stepped down in December 2006.         
	A close associate of Dutt, however, pointed out that the current state of affairs hasnt been to Dutts liking. Bengal cricket is in the ICU There has been nothing to show for during Mukherjees regime. Despite big assurances, the infrastructure hasnt improved one bit.         
	He may not open his mouth in public but he has made his views known in quarters that matter. He obviously wants someone experienced, like Dalmiya, to be back at the helm, the source said.         
	Organising one-dayers and Test matches are routine affairs and credit shouldnt be taken for that In fact Eden has earned a bad name under Mukherjee for organisational lapses that varied from poor drainage to floodlights going off, Dutt is believed to have said in close quarters.         
	The latest controversy surrounding the CAB and the malis has also left him peeved. Why is there so much of disgruntlement? The crores earned through the IPL should be used for the benefit of the people who have made it possible, the close associate said.

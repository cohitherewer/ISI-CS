                                                                                                                                                                                                     ICC to deal with clash of dates
                      
	Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) would overcome any potential clash of dates between its Future Tours Programme (FTP) and the rescheduled Champions Trophy by working with the respective cricket boards, an ICC spokesperson said on Monday.         
	A tricky situation has arisen as the new schedule for holding the Champions Trophy, postponed by the world governing body of the game from next month to October 2009, coincides with the period earmarked for the seven-match ODI series between hosts India and Australia under the FTP.         
	It was agreed by all those on the ICC board during its (telephone) hook-up (Sunday) that if there were any issues relating to scheduling then the ICC management would work with the relevant members (boards) to ensure that issues were overcome, said ICCs media and communications manager, Brian Murgatroyd.

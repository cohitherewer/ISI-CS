The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spurs bring in Harry Houdini
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Spurs bring in Harry Houdini
                      
	London: Spaniard Juande Ramos paid for Tottenham Hotspurs worst ever start to a season on Saturday when he was sacked, almost a year to the day since taking over from Dutchman Martin Jol. Spurs also announced the departure of sporting director Damien Comolli on the club website.         
	Portsmouths Harry Redknapp has been appointed as manager at White Hart Lane, after Spurs agreed to pay about 5 million in compensation to Portsmouth.         
	Redknapp has been nicknamed Houdini for his ability to salvage seemingly lost causes and will need all his escapology powers at Tottenham Hotspur when he begins the latest chapter in his colourful managerial career.         
	The decision by chairman Daniel Levy to bring in Ramos from Sevilla appeared to be a masterstroke last season when Spurs won the League Cup, their first silverware for nearly a decade.

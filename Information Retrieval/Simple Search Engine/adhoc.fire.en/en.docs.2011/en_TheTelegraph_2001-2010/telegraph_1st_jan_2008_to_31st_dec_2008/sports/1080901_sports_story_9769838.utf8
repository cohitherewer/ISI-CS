The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England women thump India
                                                                                                                                                                                                     England women thump India
                      
	Bath: Skipper Mithali Rajs grim battle went in vain as the English eves thumped India by eight wickets with 14 overs to spare in the first of the five-match ODI series at the Bath cricket club ground here.         
	Isa Guha (3/30), the bustling medium pacer with Calcutta roots mowed down Indias top order and then Jenny Gunn (3/13) polished the tail as the visitors were shot out for a meagre 124 in 43.4 overs.         
	Chasing the target, the hosts cruised to 125 for two in 36 overs to complete the formalities.         
	Guha removed the scoreless Jaya Sharma and Asha Rawat off successive deliveries to reduce India to four for two. Opener Sulakshana Naik (5) fell soon to Katherine Brunt to leave India gasping at six for three.         
	Amita Sharma (34) and Mithali (44) then joined hands to stem the rot with a 48-run stand before Isa struck again, claiming her third victim in Amita. Amitas brisk 34 came off 38 balls and included seven hits to the fence.         
	Hemlata Kala (10) joined Mithali in the middle and though runs didnt exactly flow from her blade, her dogged defiance ensured there was no immediate setback for the side.         
	Kala eventually returned with the team score at 99 and one run later, Mithali joined her in the pavilion after a 75-ball knock of 44 that included seven boundaries.         
	It triggered another batting collapse and in fact none of the last five batters could reach the double digit.         
	England got off to a decent start with openers Caroline Atkins (45) and Sarah Taylor (16) putting on 37 runs before ODI debutante Niranjana Nagarajan removed the latter.

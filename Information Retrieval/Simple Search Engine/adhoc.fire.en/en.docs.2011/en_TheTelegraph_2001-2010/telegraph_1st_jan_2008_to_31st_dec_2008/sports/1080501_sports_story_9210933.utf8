The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Call for life ban on Harbhajan
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Call for life ban on Harbhajan
                      
	Melbourne: Former Australian Test umpire Lou Rowan on Wednesday labelled Harbhajan Singh a menace on the field and called for a life ban on the temperamental off-spinner for slapping India teammate Sreesanth.         
	This fellow doesnt belong to the game of cricket. He has shown he is no good. They should just get rid of him from the sport, Rowan told a newspaper. I dont know what other sport would want him, though, he added sarcastically.         
	The umpire felt the 11-match ban imposed on him by the IPL council was too light.         
	I certainly dont think he would have been allowed to get away with what he has been allowed to get away with in any other sport. They should just get rid of him and move on, he said.

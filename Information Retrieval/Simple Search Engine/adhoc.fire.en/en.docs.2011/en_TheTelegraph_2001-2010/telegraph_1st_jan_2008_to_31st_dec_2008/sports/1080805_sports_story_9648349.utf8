The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand is king of Mainz again
                                                                                                                                                                                             Anand is king of Mainz again

	Mainz: World champion Viswanathan Anand brushed aside the challenge of Norwegian prodigy Magnus Carlsen to comprehensively win the Grenkeleasing Rapid World Chess Championship by a 3-1 margin.         
	Anand, now an 11- time winner with last eight times in a row, left the chess pundits gasping with some spectacular chess in the first game which had such a denting effect on Carlsen that he just could not manage a comeback.         
	For the records Anand won the first two games itself and needed just a draw in the remainder of the 4-games final. After Carlsen could do little with black pieces and had to agree for a draw in the third game, the Indian ace had already won another title on his favourite hunting ground with one game to spare. If Carlsen had a comeback chance, it was in the second game of the match where he played his first white. As things took a decisive turn, Anand knocked down a pawn, meticulously converted to a winning queen and pawns endgames and won another 50-mover. In the third game it was all over for Carlsen early after Anand went for a safe variation with his white pieces against the Sicilian defense.         
	 Carlsen, who had come here directly from the Biel super-tourney found many sympathisers but Anand clearly was the much better player on Sunday.         
	The finale was just of academic interest wherein a visibly tired Carlsen just did not find reasons to please spectators and signed peace in just 11 moves.         
	Earlier in the first game of the match, Anand faced the Sicilian dragon and had an ace up his sleeves when the complications arose. Sacrificing a pawn typical of the structure, Anand ripped apart Carlsens position beyond repairs in quick time and the Norwegian had to part with his queen for little compensation.         
	The rest just required correct technique and Anand romped home in 50 moves. In the fight for the 3rd place, Alexander Morozevich of Russia and Judit Polgar of Hungary fought hard but the end result was in favour of the former.

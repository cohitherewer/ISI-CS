The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rubens breaks F1 mark
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rubens breaks F1 mark
                      
	Istanbul: Rubens Barrichello became Formula Ones most experienced driver at the Turkish GP on Sunday.         
	The 35-year-old Brazilian competed in his 257th race at the Istanbul Speed Park Circuit to surpass Riccardo Patreses 15-year mark.         
	Honda is marking the feat over three races to appease those who have suggested that Barrichello is still three short of breaking Patreses mark.         
	The former Ferrari and Stewart GP driver didnt start three races after completing the formation lap. But just taking part in the formation lap counts, according to FIA rules.         
	I know I missed two races in 2002, when my car died on the grid, but at least I was present all weekend and the marshals rolled me across the starting line  those have to count, said Barrichello, who began his racing career at Jordan at the 1993 South African GP. It feels like I started yesterday and I dont know how.         
	Meanwhile, in the GP2 Series, Bruce Senna was furious after having to abandon his race on Sunday with car troubles. The problem? The front-right section of his car was mangled after he hit a dog that had made its way on to the Istanbul circuit.         
	Its unreal that something like this can happen at a Formula One event, said Senna, who is the nephew of Ayrton Senna. You expect an accident or retirement to take you out. Not this.

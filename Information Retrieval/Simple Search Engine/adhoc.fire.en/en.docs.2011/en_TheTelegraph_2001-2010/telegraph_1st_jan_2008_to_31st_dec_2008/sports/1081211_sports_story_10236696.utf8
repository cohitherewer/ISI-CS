            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Okolie Odafe scored four goals as Churchill Brothers trounced hapless Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) 7-0 to reach the Federation Cup semi-finals from group B.         
	Churchill, tied on seven points from three matches with Mahindra United, clinched the spot thanks to better goal difference. Raju Yumnam opened the scoring for the Goa side in the fifth minute. Odafe notched up the second (his first) in the 16th minute of the match with Kalu Ogba adding another in the very next minute. Churchill went into the lemon break up 3-0.         
	Odafe showed his class in the second half. The prolific striker added three more to his first half tally in the 61st, 81st and 88th minutes to assure his team a place in the last four of the tournament they have never won.         
	Bineesh Balan also scored one in the 64th minute.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal pacer Ranadeb Bose feels he was lucky on Saturday.         
	Ranadeb, in a devastating spell of nine overs, ran through the Tripura batting, bagging five wickets. It made him the second Bengal pacer to join the 200-wicket club in Rani Trophy.         
	I feel I was a bit lucky today, Ranadeb said after first days play at the Eden. Today I put the ball in the right areas and stuck to a plan.         
	Picking up five wickets in the first spell does not happen regularly. I am very happy, he added.         
	The 29-year old now has 200 wickets in 52 Ranji Trophy matches. Dedicating this feat to his coach Gopal Bose and father Ranajit Bose, Ranadeb said he never sets any target for himself.         
	He just enjoys bowling and he owes much of his success to his coach.         
	I owe this success to my coach Gopal Bose and my father. I want to continue playing My job is to take wickets and Id love to go on doing that, he stressed.         
	Meanwhile, asked about his plans for Sunday, Bengal skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla said: Tomorrow will be a crucial day I cannot say anything now. We would like to put up a good score Good that Manoj is back in form That is a good sign for us.         
	Bengal would want to grab full points from this match before they take on Assam and Vidarbha in the fight for promotion to the Elite Group of Ranji Trophy.         
	The hosts had missed out narrowly on a come-form-behind victory against Madhya Pradesh.

	Dubai: Mahesh Bhupathi kept the Indian interest alive at the $1,410,000 Dubai Championships by advancing to the doubles semi-finals along with Mark Knowles.         
	The fourth-seeded Indo-Bahamas pair registered a comprehensive quarter final victory over Spanish duo of Rafael Nadal and Feliciano Lopez 6-1, 6-1.         
	They now take on second seeds Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Julian Knowle of Austria, who had ousted Leander Paes-Paul Hanley combine in the first round.         
	Rohan Bopanna and his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul Haq also crashed out.         
	In singles, American sixth seed Andy Roddick will play unseeded Spaniard Feliciano Lopez in the final on Saturday.         
	Roddick overcame third seed Novak Djokovic of Serbia 7-6, 6-3 while Lopez recovered from 2-5 in the final set to beat fifth-seeded Russian Nikolay Davydenko 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.         
	Im excited, said Roddick. I played well tonight and I played the right way. I had to, otherwise I wasnt going to win.         
	The first set was tight with Djokovic matching Roddicks serve and the American trading on equal terms in the rallies.         
	The only break point fell to the Serb when he got to 40-15 while leading 2-1 but Roddick fired two big serves that Djokovic was unable to play effectively.         
	Having lost the first set, Djokovic looked unlikely to turn the match around in the second.         
	He fought off a break point when Roddick led 1-0 and another at 2-1 and was broken for 5-3 after a backhand error.         
	He wasnt missing at all in the first set, Roddick said. He wasnt missing serves and I couldnt get into his service games. I definitely had to try to stay the course and try and tough out some games before I got the momentum on my side there in the tiebreak.         
	Djokovic knew Roddick felt comfortable on the surface, and that made him uneasy.         
	I was nervous from the start, Djokovic said. I didnt return well, although of course considering he has the strongest serve in tennis its not that easy to get the rhythm.         
	So I was trying to hold my serve and I was doing it pretty well in the first set.           (REUTERS)

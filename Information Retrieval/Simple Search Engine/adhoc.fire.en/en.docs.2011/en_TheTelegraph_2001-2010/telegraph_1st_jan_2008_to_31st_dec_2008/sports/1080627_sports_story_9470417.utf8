  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Former captain talks of the present and looks ahead to the Champions Trophy         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Ramiz Raja      
	Karachi: Raja, who has quickly grown into a broadcaster with a difference, spoke to The Telegraph before Thursdays India-Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q It appears the average Pakistani is no longer that emotionally involved in an India-Pakistan face-off...         
	A I cant really put my finger on one reason... In general, of course, the fan-following for cricket itself is less... Perhaps, its because of tours which got cancelled... The uncertainty which surrounds a tournament... It could also be because the Pakistan team have been so inconsistent in the past couple of years. As for this Asia Cup, its an out-of-the-season tournament and its hot at this time of the year... Still, Im disappointed with the response of fans in Karachi so far... Its an entertainment-starved society here and, usually, people support cricket in a big way.         
	Do you think the low level of interest, at least till Wednesday, could have something to do with the after-effects of the IPL?         
	Its possible... The IPL was very closely followed in Pakistan and the ratings pleased Geo Super, which was telecasting those matches...         
	Has the time come for the one-day game to reinvent itself?         
	(After a pause) I wouldnt like to make a hasty comment... Last night, for example, we saw an excellent ODI at The Oval between England and New Zealand... Whats critical is the slotting of tournaments and Test cricket... Nothing should overlap... Each form, which includes Twenty20, has to be given space.         
	As a former captain and chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, whats your take on a number of cricketers from Australia, England and New Zealand having strong reservations about coming for the Champions Trophy in September?         
	The reservations have come about owing to their perception... I dont blame them because if youre not in Pakistan and you keep hearing and reading about blasts and chaos, then you could be influenced by all that... Unfortunately, weve been getting such negative publicity and, as a result, people outside tend to have doubts... Having said all that, Im definitely a little disappointed as Pakistan (cricket) needs everybodys support... A positive attitude from the West, so to say, would be of great help... The Champions Trophy, though, has already been launched.         
	Yes, but the tournament is still some months away...         
	I agree... However, I believe the existing political system will give Pakistan stability... Progressively, were seeing a calmer Pakistan and things should get better (by September).         
	To talk of the Pakistan team, whats right and whats wrong with it?         
	(Grins) Were the mercurial type... We find it difficult to stay normal for any length of time! This team has, in recent times, absorbed a lot of negative criticism... It has been written off and the seniors in particular are absolutely intent on proving everybody wrong... Thats a good sign, but I do feel we need a new captain.         
	Youve been favouring vice-captain Misbah-ul Haq...         
	Hes a performer and remains calm under pressure, plus hes respected in the dressing room... Misbah may not be that experienced at the international level, but has been around for years... Indeed, hes the hard working, no-nonsense type.         
	Captain Shoaib Malik has resumed bowling... Was he advised to do so?         
	I think, yes... Otherwise, Malik cant hold his place in the XI... He didnt have a choice... He needs to bowl as that gives the team a certain amount of balance.         
	You do a show with Younis Khan and get to interact with him in a relaxed setting. Why isnt he keen on the captaincy?         
	Actually, we havent spoken about the captaincy bit... Somehow that hasnt come up...         
	Whats the update on your good friend, Shoaib Akhtar?         
	(Laughs) I havent been keeping a track of his travails... Perhaps, theres been pressure from the IPL (to go soft on the one-time spearhead)...         
	Since youve brought up the IPL... Are you surprised that performances in the IPL are being spoken of, by many, in almost the same breath as performances for ones country?         
	Well, performances in the IPL should be given weightage... I say that because of the passion and involvement I saw on the faces of some of the biggest names... A Sachin Tendulkar... Muttiah Muralidharan... A Shane Warne... Rahul Dravid... They felt the pressure and wanted to do very well... I accept that some matches were flat, but some were truly quality contests.         
	The final one. Do we, in the region, tend to underestimate Sri Lanka?         
	Thats probably because theyve been the quieter of the three bigger teams in the subcontinent... But theyve got outstanding players and will be taking forward two points into the next stage of the Asia Cup  the Super Fours. Looking at the bigger picture, thats significant.

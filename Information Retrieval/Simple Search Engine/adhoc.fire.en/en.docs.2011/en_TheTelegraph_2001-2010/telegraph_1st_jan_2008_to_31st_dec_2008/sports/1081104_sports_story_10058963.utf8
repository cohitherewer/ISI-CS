	New Delhi: Barring doubles pro Mahesh Bhupathi, no other Indian managed to gain places in the tennis rankings issued Monday with veteran Leander Paes dropping one spot and Sania Mirza sliding two rungs in the ATP doubles and WTA singles charts, respectively.         
	Bhupathi, who along with Bahamian partner Mark Knowles clinched their third ATP title together this season, winning the Davidoff Swiss Indoors Championship recently, gained one spot to be placed 6th with 3295 rating points.         
	However, the going was tough for his estranged partner Leander Paes, who dropped to 10th with 2900 points.         
	Both Paes and Bhupathi had crashed out in the second round of the euro 2,270,000 Paris Masters last week after suffering straight-set defeats along with their respective partners.         
	Meanwhile, out-of-action Sania slipped to 99th spot in the womens singles chart, although she managed to hold on to the 62nd position in the doubles ranking.

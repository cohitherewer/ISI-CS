                                                                                                                                                                                                     Selection surprises Dinda
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Ashok Dinda        
	Calcutta: Bengal pacer Ashok Dinda was surprised after finding his name in the 14-member Rest of India squad for the ensuing Irani Trophy. I got the news today in the afternoon, Dinda told The Telegraph from Hyderabad on Monday.         
	I was quite surprised... But moments later I realised that I am approaching what I had dreamt of since my childhood. It feels nice when things are getting brighter with each passing day. I am happy and want to work harder to make this chance count, the pacer said.         
	The 24-year old Dinda was dropped from the India A squad for the upcoming limited-over series against Australia A and New Zealand A beginning September 16.         
	Yeah I know that my performances were not that good recently. I was bit upset after being dropped from the India A ODI side. I am thankful that I got the chance. I am really excited, he elaborated.         
	Talking about his plans to make the India cut, Dinda said: I am taking one match at a time. Now I am focussed on the Rajkot match (three-dayer against Australia A).         
	Asked how the tips from his Kolkata Knight Riders teammates have helped, Dinda said: Obviously their advice has changed my thinking altogether. After the Indian Premier League, I would like to point out that I am a more matured player. In the series against Israel, he picked up six wickets from three matches. The performance was instrumental in his selection.

                                                                                                                                                                                           Vijender punches way into second round
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Beijing: Indian boxer Vijender Kumar moved into the second round of the 75kg category with a 13-2 victory over Gambian Badou Jack on Saturday. Compatriot Dinesh Kumars campaign in the 81kg category against Abdelhafid Benchabla was cut short. The Algerian outscored the Indian, forcing the referee to stop the contest.         
	Vijender meets Chomphuphuang Angkhan of Thailand in the next round.         
	Shuttler Saina Nehwal thrashed her Russian opponent Ella Karachkova to storm into the second round. The national champion needed less than half-an-hour to oust Karachkova 21-9, 21-8 to set up a date with Ukrainian Larysa Gryga.         
	The rest of the Indian performance was all about disappointments, with shooters topping the list. Anjali Bhagwat (29th) and Avneet Kaur Sidhu (39th) failed to enter the finals of the 10m air-rifle event here.         
	Anjali shot a total of 393/400 and Avneet could manage 389/400.         
	Samresh Jung too failed to make the finals in mens 10m air pistol event, shooting a disappointing 570/600 to finish 42nd among 48 shooters.         
	At the trap ranges, world champion Manavjit Singh Sandhu overcame a shaky start to finish with 70 out of 75 and was placed 12th after the first day. The next 50 shots will be on Sunday after which the top six shooters will make it to the final.         
	The biggest disappointment of the day was Mansher Singh. He went straight and shot 25 out of 25 in the first series and then a 24. But in the last series, his form slumped and he could only muster a score of 20. The seasoned marksman is now placed 21st, and his chances of making it to the final are as good as over.         
	Judoka K. Tombi Devis campaign lasted all of two and a half minutes as she was knocked out in the preliminary round of the womens 48kg event by Ana Hormigo of Portugal.         
	In swimming, Sandeep Sejwal failed to qualify for the semi-finals of mens 100m breaststroke.

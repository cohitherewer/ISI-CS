The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis Hamilton roars to pole position
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lewis Hamilton roars to pole position
    - Japanese Grand Prix

	Fuji: McLarens Lewis Hamilton boosted his Formula One world title chances by roaring to pole position for Sundays Japanese Grand Prix, while Ferraris Felipe Massa qualified as fifth.         
	The Briton, who leads the standings with seven points more than Massa with three races remaining, starts ahead of Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen on the front row after a late charge in Saturdays qualifying.         
	McLaren teammate Heikki Kovalainen was the third quickest with Renaults two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, the surprise winner in Singapore two weeks ago, fourth in the sunshine.         
	It was disappointment once again for Force India drivers Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella as they will start Sundays race at the 19th and 20th positions respectively on the grid.         
	The title is obviously within my grasp, Hamilton told reporters after securing his sixth pole of the year and the 12th of his 33-race career. Were in a perfect position to score as many points as we can. I just have to keep the car on the road and bring it home.         
	Hamilton won a wet race here from pole in his first season last year to open a 12-point lead over former teammate Alonso, only to blow his chance away in the final two races in China and Brazil. Raikkonen clawed his way back from 17 points behind to win the championship by a single point, but the Finns hopes of a repeat have been wrecked by a run of four races without a victory.         
	Massas hopes of becoming the first Brazilian to win the title since the late Ayrton Senna in 1991 suffered another blow. I was the quickest man on the track but at the wrong moment, he said. Ive ended up fifth on the grid which is definitely not an easy place to be. Shame.                     
	Raikkonen, a distant 27 points behind Hamilton and only mathematically still in the contest, ruled out any hope of another miraculous fightback.         
	Im not thinking about the world championship, said the Finn, back on the front row for the first time since June. We want to win both championships. Its not going to be easy against the McLarens but we will try to take maximum points.         
	McLaren lead Ferrari by one point in the constructors championship.         
	Hamilton, who increased his championship lead over Massa after finishing third in Singapore while the Brazilian failed to score in the night race after a botched pitstop, is bidding to become Formula Ones youngest world champion at 23.         
	Massa now needs a large slice of luck after losing two places in the dying moments of Saturdays final qualifying session, when Kovalainen and Alonso lapped faster.         
	Massa will start alongside BMW-Saubers Robert Kubica, third in the championship but 20 points behind Hamilton, with the Toyotas of Italian Jarno Trulli and Germanys Timo Glock behind on the fourth row at the Japanese teams home circuit.         
	Toro Rosso filled the fifth row with Germanys Sebastian Vettel, winner in Italy, and Frances Sebastien Bourdais.         
	Further back, Japans only Grand Prix driver Kazuki Nakajima out-qualified his Williams teammate Nico Rosberg to take the 14th place for his home debut.           (REUTERS)

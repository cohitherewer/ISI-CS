                                                   Houghton to hold special camp for juniors
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Bob Houghton has decided to hold a special camp for 21 junior footballers who may end up challenging their more established seniors for a place in the national team this season.         
	While the special camp will start in Goa from March 26, another set of 24 regular national team players will join the camp on April 5. These are being organised to select the squad for the SAFF Cup and the AFC Challenge Cup.         
	In the core committee meeting of the AIFF recently, Houghton stressed on the need for a special camp for new players. They need to stay longer to adjust to his coaching system, he said.         
	Houghton is planning to take the national team for a tour-cum-preparatory camp in Portugal. While the SAFF Cup will be played in Sri Lanka in June, AFC Challenge Cup will be held either in Delhi or Hyderabad in August.

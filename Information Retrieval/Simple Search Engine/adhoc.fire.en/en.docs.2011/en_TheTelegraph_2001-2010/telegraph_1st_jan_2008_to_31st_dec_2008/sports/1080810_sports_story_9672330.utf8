                                                                                                                                                                                           Reds reject loan offer
                      
	 Liverpool owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr vetoed Rafael Benitezs bid to buy Gareth Barry by turning down an offer of a 12m interest-free loan to help buy the Aston Villa midfield player.         
	The loan which was proposed by a millionaire Liverpool fan concerned about the ramifications for the club if the deal fell through, was offered this week and rejected by the owners. The 12m would have financed the initial instalments demanded by Villa.         
	Robinho bid         
	 Real Madrid have turned down Chelseas opening 19.75m offer for Robinho and are holding out for around 30m for the Brazil forward, who feels undervalued because his club have been involved in negotiations to bring in players for his position. Luiz Felipe Scolari, the Chelsea manager, is said to telephone Robinho every day to boost his spirits, according to Wagner Ribeiro, his agent.         
	Arshavin frustrated         
	 Andrei Arshavin has said that he is frustrated that a fee cannot be agreed for him to move from Zenit St Petersburg to Tottenham Hotspur. The Russian club wants more than 20m for the forward, 5m more than Tottenham are willing to offer.         
	Arsenal target         
	 Switzerlands Gokhan Inlers agent Dino Lamberti has said that he has held talks with Arsenal about the Udinese midfield player. It was very positive, Lamberti said.

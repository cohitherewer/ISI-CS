            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi and representatives of Shah Rukh Khans Red Chillies Entertainment  the winners in the bidding for the Calcutta team  on Monday inspected the facilities at the Eden.         
	We discussed a few things about upgradation as per the IPL requirements, said Modi.         
	Sourav Ganguly, who will lead the Calcutta side, was also present.         
	The former India captain has been given the responsibility of deciding on the pool of players.         
	The minimum bidding amount for a pool of contracted players in each franchise team has been fixed at $3.3 million with the maximum cap at $5 million.         
	The theme song will be composed by Usha Uthup. To add to the glamour element, several film personalities will be present during the seven matches at the Eden.         
	The CAB is hoping to finish the construction of five-star food courts and washrooms in time at various parts of the stadium.         
	The association has been asked to maintain a clean and healthy atmosphere.         
	Six platforms will be constructed around the ground for music and dance.         
	An overhauling of the sitting arrangements in the galleries, though, will be tough to complete.         
	The CAB has already been sanctioned Rs 10 crore by the BCCI.

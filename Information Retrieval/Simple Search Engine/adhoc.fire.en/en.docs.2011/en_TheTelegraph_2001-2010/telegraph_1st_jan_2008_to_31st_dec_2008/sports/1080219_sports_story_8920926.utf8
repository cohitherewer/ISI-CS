	Chennai: India Cements Ltd, a franchisee of the Indian Premier League (IPL), on Monday christened its team Chennai Super Kings and unveiled its logo at a function here.         
	Former India opener Krishnamachari Srikkanth has been roped in as the teams brand ambassador, while his contemporary and state mate V B Chandrasekar, a former national selector, would be in-charge of picking the players.         
	Company vice chairman and managing director N. Srinivasan unveiled the logo and said it was a red letter day for Tamil Nadu cricket. It is a red letter day in the annals of Tamil Nadu cricket. I am thrilled to announce the name and unveil the logo, he said.         
	Srinivasan, also BCCI treasurer, said there would be eight foreign players in the team with four of them in the playing XI.         
	Like other franchisee holders, the Chennai team must wait till the auction on Wednesday (to bid for foreign players) to know the names, he said.         
	We plan to have 23 players in Super Kings, said Srinivasan.         
	He said all seven home matches would be played at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.         
	Srikkanth, who recalled his playing days, said he had never played any match for more than 20 overs and that he has been aptly named brand ambassador for the Chennai team.         
	We are here to showcase talent from Tamil Nadu. I am confident that the most knowledgeable Chennai spectators are in for high octane action during the tournament.         
	Meanwhile, all the Indian cricketers contracted to the BCCI have signed up for the multi-million dollar Indian Premier League (IPL) set to commence on April 18 in Bangalore, another reports adds from Mumbai.

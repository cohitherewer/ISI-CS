The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modric penalty gives Croatia victory

  - Austrian effort not not good enough

	Vienna: Croatia got their Euro 2008 campaign off to a winning start on Sunday when a fourth-minute Luka Modric penalty proved enough to beat co-hosts Austria 1-0 in the opening game of group B.         
	And Austria goalkeeper Juergen Machos dream which finally came true on Sunday, was spoiled within four minutes.         
	Macho had to fight Alexander Manninger and Helge Payer for a year and a half to become Austrias No. 1 goalkeeper going into the European Championship, which his country is co-hosting. But, having worked so hard to make the lineup, he didnt get anything like the start he would have wanted of his teams opening match.         
	Macho had touched the ball just once, for a goal kick, when he had to turn around and pick the ball out of the net in the fourth minute.         
	Luka Modric and Ivica Olic combined down the left wing from a throw-in and took the ball into the box before Rene Aufhauser ran across and knocked down Olic as he went past.         
	Dutch referee Pieter Vink awarded the penalty and Modric sent the ball low and into the middle of the net as Macho dived to the right.         
	It was the 12th goal Macho had conceded in 15 appearances for the national team.         
	Croatia were well worth their win against a team placed 92nd in Fifas world rankings.         
	Austria have been widely tipped to lose all three games in their first appearance at a European Championship.         
	Though they were keen enough, their disjointed efforts betrayed a lack of competitive action and they only came alive in the last 20 minutes.

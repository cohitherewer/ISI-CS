The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beijing is as exciting as Sydney
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Beijing is as exciting as Sydney

	A lot has changed with the Olympics in the eight years since my last competitive Games. I remember Sydney being one of the greatest in modern times. There were magnificent performances, a victorious hometown hero in Cathy Freeman, and an entire country enthusiastically supportive of hosting the Games and the world.         
	When I look back at Sydney, the stories that stick in the memory are Freeman, an aboriginal athlete, lighting the Olympic torch and achieving glory in her home country, Marie-Jose Perec, the defending Olympic gold medallist in 400 metres, bolting from Sydney to escape the pressure of her showdown with Freeman before the athletics had even begun, and CJ Hunter admitting during a press conference, with former partner Marion Jones by his side, that he had tested positive for a banned substance.                 Artists perform during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing on Friday. (AFP)      
	Fast forward eight years and the issues everyone is talking about here are security, drugs and political protests. In the years that have passed since the turn of the century, the world has experienced 9/11 and the London bombings of 2005, making security now a primary focus for any organising committee staging the Games.         
	Then, of course, there have been the drugs scandals, which have touched so many sports  from the Tour de France to Major League baseball, and, of course, track and field. The BALCO investigation unmasked the widespread use of designer drugs in athletics and some of the biggest stars have fallen.         
	Marion Jones, Justin Gatlin, Tim Montgomery and others have been exposed as cheats, leaving everyone here debating, again, if we can believe the performances we will see over the next 16 days.         
	Then there is the issue of the hosts themselves. Chinas human rights record, their treatment of Tibet and involvement in Darfur, air quality in Beijing and their fast-growing economy are all of interest around the world, all highlighted over the last year leading up to the Games by the torch-relay protests.         
	Controversy sells, and any publicity can be good publicity. The world will be watching and there is enormous interest in these Games, both because they are the worlds largest sports spectacle and because we are in China, where the event is seen as a coming-out party.         
	But away from the storm of political protests and pollution fears, once the action gets under way there will be great sports stories. Michael Phelps, the American swimmer seeking a record eight-medal haul. The mens 100m battle to determine the fastest man on the planet  made even more interesting with former world-record holder Asafa Powell, new holder Usain Bolt and defending world champion Tyson Gay all in the running. Then, we have the defending Olympic champion and one of Chinas biggest celebrities, Liu Xiang, aiming to win 110m hurdles gold on home soil.         
	Of perhaps greatest interest is the wider power struggle for supremacy at the summit of the medal table. For the first time since the Russians finished top in Barcelona in 1992, there is the possibility that America will not be No1. There are plenty of people predicting that China will take over from the Americans in front of their home crowd.         
	Whatever happens, I cant deny that these Games have made me as excited now as I was those years ago in Sydney.

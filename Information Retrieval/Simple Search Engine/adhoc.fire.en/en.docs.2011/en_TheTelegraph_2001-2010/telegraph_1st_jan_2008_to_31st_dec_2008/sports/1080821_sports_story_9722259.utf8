	Beijing: Ukraines Olympic heptathlon silver medallist Liudmyla Blonska has failed a drugs test, the IOC confirmed.         
	The 30-year-olds sample tested positive for a banned substance, but the IOC source said they were still awaiting the results of the B-sample.         
	 The disciplinary commission of the IOC will hold a meeting before passing on their recommendations to the executive board.         
	There has been an adverse finding in her a sample against her (Blonska), said the source. And there is a process being followed against her. However, she has not been stripped of her medal.         
	There will be a disciplinary commission hearing about her case and because she is a medallist it will be then passed to the executive board.         
	The Ukrainian had already served a previous ban for testing positive in 2003 for Stanozolol, the anabolic steroid used by the disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson.           (REUTERS)

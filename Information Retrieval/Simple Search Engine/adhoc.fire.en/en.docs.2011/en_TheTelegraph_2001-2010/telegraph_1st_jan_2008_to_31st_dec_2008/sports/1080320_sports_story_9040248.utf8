	New Delhi: The rapidly changing dynamics of cricket was bringing about some alterations in the way the game is played, former India coach Greg Chappell said on Wednesday.         
	I have seen a predominant tendency among youngsters to use heavier bats which mean they become more of bottom-handed players, the former Australia captain said. This will make them push at the ball more rather than hit it.         
	Chappell has had a close look at 4,000 aspiring cricketers in the six cities he has visited so far, Jaipur being the final leg to be completed. He also expected to see more quality young spinners than he actually did.         
	Most of those we saw, interestingly, were left-arm finger spinners. There were very few off-spinners and leg-spinners, he said.         
	Chappell and his assistant Ian Frazer, the former Team India bio-mechanist, selected five players from the almost 1,200 they saw at the Jamia Milia Islamia University.

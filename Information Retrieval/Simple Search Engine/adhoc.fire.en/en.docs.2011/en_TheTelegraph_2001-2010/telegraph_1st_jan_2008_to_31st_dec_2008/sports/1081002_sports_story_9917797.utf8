The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinda, Mishra bowl India A to victory
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dinda, Mishra bowl India A to victory

	Chennai: Medium pacer Ashok Dinda and leg spinner Amit Mishra shared eight wickets between them to propel India A to a comprehensive 129-run victory over New Zealand A in their four-day cricket match on Wednesday.         
	Dinda scalped five for 60 off 18.4 overs, while Mishra, selected for the Indian Test squad against Australia, claimed three for 55 in 25 overs as New Zealand, facing a stiff target of 355 for a win, were bundled out for 225 in 81.4 overs in the first over after tea break on the final day.         
	Resuming at 41/1, New Zealand attempted some resistance through Aaron Redmond (37) James Marshall (47), captain Peter Fulton (39) and Reece Young (39 not out), but the visitors kept losing wickets in quick succession.         
	Dinda, who generated good pace, claimed back-to-back wickets twice.         
	 He uprooted the off-stump of Hay and then trapped Neil Broom leg before, but missed a hat-trick when Nathan McCullum, playing backfoot, survived a confident leg before appeal with the score at 5/148.         
	Marshall, who took upon the anchor role playing 103 balls in his 177-minute stay at the crease, finally departed in the 71st over falling to Mishra, going for a sweep shot.         
	Dinda then came back strongly after tea to bowl out New Zealand of his third and fourth ball of the over.

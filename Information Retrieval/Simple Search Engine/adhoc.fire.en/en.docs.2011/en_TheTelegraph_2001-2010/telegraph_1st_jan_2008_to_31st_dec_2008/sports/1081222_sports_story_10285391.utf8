The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal back from Plate wilderness
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bengal back from Plate wilderness
            G. RAJARAMAN            Sourav Ganguly with Laxmi Ratan Shukla on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	New Delhi: It was typical of the elder statesman of the team that he left the centre-stage for his younger mates to bask in. Sourav Ganguly did his job in his final first-class game of a magnificent career, seeing Bengal through to the Ranji Trophy quarter finals and headed home, leaving the team to celebrate its return to next seasons Elite Division.         
	Souravs steadying influence had helped Bengal rally from 127 for five in their first innings to 337 and his leadership  even though Laxmi Ratan Shukla was the captain  saw the team finish with a 107-run first innings lead over Goa in the Plate Division semis on Sunday.         
	Bengal ended their spell in the wilderness of Plate Division and made it to the quarters that begin December 26.         
	On a day that cleared up after a delayed start, Sourav Sarkar claimed the three wickets that stood between Bengal and a quarter final slot. Goas Ryan Ninan stood like a rock, undefeated on 88 after a 320-minute vigil but Sarkar found the answer to overcome the defiance of Robin DSouza, Saurabh Bandekar and Harshad Gadekar.         
	As they trooped back to the pavilion, the Bengal players formed a guard of honour for the man who has done Bengal proud with his exploits at the international level.         
	Cricket Association of Bengal chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee recalled Sourav had showcased his talent and his hunger for competitive cricket at a very early stage in his career. Sourav himself told the media that he was delighted to have played an active part in his farewell game for Bengal.         
	His job done, Sourav watched Manoj Tiwary (80, 118 minutes, 92 balls, 10 fours, one six) and Dibyendu Chakrabarty (49) scuttle Goan dreams of a miraculous comeback before slipping away from the Karnail Singh Stadium. He was mobbed as he emerged from the dressing room and made his way to the car that drove him away from a first class game for the very last time.         
	Clearly, Ganguly had done enough for the team in a critical game. His first-class career started with a rain-hit Ranji Trophy final against Delhi in 1990 and ended in a game here that was affected by mist and bad light.

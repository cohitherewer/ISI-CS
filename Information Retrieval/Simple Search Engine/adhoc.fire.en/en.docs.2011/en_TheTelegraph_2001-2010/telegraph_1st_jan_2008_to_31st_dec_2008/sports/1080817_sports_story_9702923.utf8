            A STAFF REPORTER            Theodore Sunday                           
	Calcutta: An attack minded Mohammedan Sporting side tore apart relegation favourites Peerless SC 3-1 in their Sahara CFL Premier Division clash on Saturday at the Salt Lake Stadium and took over the league lead from Mohun Bagan.         
	Mohammedan Sporting went into the match knowing they couldnt afford any slip-ups going into the business end of the league and Sunday and Co. were in punishing form from the very first minute. The black and whites went into the lead in the 10th minute when the lively Sunday set up Satyajit Bose who finished with a volley from close range. Theodore Sunday doubled the lead a while later, latching on to a poor clearance from Chanchal Saha and rounding the goalkeeper.         
	Mihir Boses boys were handed a lifeline late in the first half when striker Okorogor won a penalty and scored from it. Sunday terrorised the Peerless defence in the second half, using his extra pace. His finishing let him down on two occasions.         
	The best goal of the match came from diminutive midfielder Lalchhuan Awma, who dodged past a couple of Peerless defenders before calmly slotting past the goalkeeper.

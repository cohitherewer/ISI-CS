	ANECDOTES  
	Suspicion         
	After celebrating the victory of his team in the 4x100m relay, American athlete Morris Kirksey found the hotel doors locked and was then arrested by the police after they found him climbing the front of the hotel. His plight worsened when police refused to believe he was an Olympic champion.         
	Murder         
	The American, James Howard Snook, a gold medallist in the team shooting event, was executed 10 years later in the electric chair for battering his mistress to death after she informed Howards wife of their affair.         
	Smoker         
	20-year-old Frenchman Joseph Guillemot, a pack-of-cigarattes-a-day man won the 5000m title coming home ahead of Finnish legend Paavo Nurmi. Guillemot nearly repeated his feat in the 10,000m but was suffering from stomach cramps and also had to overcome shoes that were two sizes too big after his own were stolen. He still managed to win silver.         
	Complete athlete         
	Belgiums Victor Boin, who recited the Olympic oath, was one of the great all-round athletes of his generation. During the 1908 Games he won a silver in water polo and in 1912, the bronze. In 1920, he also won a silver in the team fencing. Overall he took part in swimming, ice-skating, ice-hockey, flying, and motorcycling. He went on to become president of the Belgian Olympic Committee and the founder of the International Association of Sports Journalists.         
	Famous family         
	The American John Brendan Kelly, an Olympic champion in rowing, was the father of Grace Kelly, future Hollywood star and Princess of Monaco.         
	Diving youth         
	The American diver Aileen Riggin won the gold medal in the springboard event  while still only aged 13.         
	The Kangaroo         
	American Charles Paddock won the 100m thanks to a totally personalised technique which afforded him the nickname, the flying man. Before crossing the finishing line he made a leap of around four metres in order to save time and thus obtain victory.  
	EXPLOITS  
	Kelly bent double on revenge         
	Jack Kelly took his revenge on the organisers of the Henley-on-Thames rowing regatta, who had previously prevented his participation in the event. Undoubtedly, coupled with his obvious talent for rowing, this formed a major part of his determination until realising victory in the skiff in Antwerp. Kelly, a 20-year-old manual worker from Philadelphia, beat Britains Jack Beresford, winner of the famous regatta a few weeks previously, by a mere second. A half-hour following Kellys victory, he embarked on the double sculls event joined by his compatriot Paul Costello. In 7 minutes 9 seconds he won his second gold medal. Two titles in thirty minutes: a feat no other athlete has since accomplished at the Olympic Games.         
	Excluded         
	His exclusion from the English regatta was apparently due to the fact that he belonged to the Vesper Rowing Club of Philadelphia, a club that was considered semi-professional by the English organisers. Officially, they gave the excuse that the British gentlemen did not find it sporting to compete against a manual worker.  
	SUMMARY  
	Doves of peace         
	After an interruption of eight years due to the First World War, the Olympic Games returned to action in Antwerp. The Belgian city, which had been severely bombarded during the war, was chosen to host the Games shortly after the end of the conflict. The Games did not welcome Germany and allies, and would be organised with one underlying necessity for the 29 nations involved: austerity.         
	In some senses this Olympiad was historic: the five-ringed Olympic flag and oath  pronounced by Belgian fencer Victor Boin  made their first appearance (even though the oath had been read during the intercalated games in 1906). Another innovation was the publics involvement in the releasing of hundreds of doves during the opening ceremony, symbolising the return of peace to the continent of Europe.         
	A Finnish surprise         
	The US came top with 40 gold medals, with a total of 94, although the athletics events were ill attended, notably due to the elevated price of tickets for the competitions. One surprise victor was Finland, mostly thanks to a young long distance specialist  a 23-year-old who won three gold medals and one silver, a certain Paavo Nurmi. The other big Finnish name at these Games was Hannes Kolehmainen, who, having won the 5000 and 10,000 metres in 1912, went on to win the marathon event.

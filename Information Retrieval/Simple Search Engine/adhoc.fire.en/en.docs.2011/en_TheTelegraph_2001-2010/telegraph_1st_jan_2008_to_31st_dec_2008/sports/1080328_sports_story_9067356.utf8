                                                     Kapil takes move in stride
  - No commemoration of 83 Cup win as Board wants to look ahead       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sunil Gavaskar is organising a reunion at Lords on June 25                                 
	Calcutta: In not wanting to honour Kapil Dev because of his involvement with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), the Board has decided against commemorating 25 years of Indias momentous World Cup win.         
	But if the Board comes across as petty, Kapil (who led by example in that tournament) definitely has a big heart.         
	Frankly, I wouldnt have minded had the Board decided to honour everybody except me You cant, after all, ignore such a big achievement I didnt win the World Cup alone Mujhe nahin bulate to bhi theek tha, Kapil told The Telegraph on Thursday evening.         
	Speaking on the sidelines of an ICL function to mark actor Mithun Chakraborty becoming a co-owner of the Kolkata Tigers (to be renamed Royal Bengal Tigers from the ICLs second season) team, Kapil added: Even if the Board isnt doing anything, Sunil (Gavaskar) is organising a private function at Lords on June 25 Its for the players and by the players and Im looking forward to it         
	Gavaskar has booked the Long Room there for a sit-down dinner.         
	According to Kapil, Gavaskar sounded him out some weeks ago and the 14-member World Cup-winning squad could meet after a month or so to finalise what else needed to be done that day.         
	Today, I dont have any emotions Am not thinking too much of June 25 But, yes, Im bound to get emotional once all of us reassemble at Lords It will be a special occasion, Kapil remar- ked.         
	Asked why the Board, which felicitated Test captain Anil Kumble (for taking 600 wickets) earlier this week, wasnt doing anything to remember the 1983 heroes, an office-bearer bluntly said: Thats because we want to look ahead, not back Why go back to the past?         
	Astonishing, really.         
	The gentleman needs to be told that the 1983 World Cup win changed the face of Indian cricket. Encouraged Sachin Tendulkar to dump tennis Elevated cricket to a status much beyond sport         
	And more.         
	Kapil, by the way, isnt the only member of that squad involved with the ICL. Three others  Sandeep Patil, Madanlal and Balwinder Singh Sandhu, all of whom featured in that memorable final against the West Indies  are also on the Boards blacklist.         
	The Board can stop their pensions (the matter, expectedly, is in court), but cant rewrite history.         
	Thankfully.

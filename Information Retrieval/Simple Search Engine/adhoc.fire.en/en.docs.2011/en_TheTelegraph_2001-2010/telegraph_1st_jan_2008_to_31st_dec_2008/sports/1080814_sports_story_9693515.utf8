	BEIJING, Aug. 14 (AP): A taxi caught fire near a tourist site in Beijing on Thursday but no injuries were reported, authorities said, amid heightened security in the Olympics host city after a traveler was killed in a recent attack.         
	The fire occurred near the ancient Lama Temple, in the northeast corner of downtown Beijing, and was caused by quot;spontaneous ignition quot; in the vehicle, said Wu Jun, a propaganda officer with the Beijing district of Dongchengs public security bureau.         
	Wu said the taxis driver and passenger escaped the vehicle without injury, and no bystanders were hurt.         
	Police are investigating the incident, quot; Wu said, declining to provide further details.         
	Several police cars were parked around the taxi, which had pulled to the side of the road about 330 yards (300 meters) east of Yonghegong Bridge, near the temple. The cars windshield was shattered but its interior appeared largely intact.         
	Chinese authorities have tightened security at tourist spots around the city after a Chinese man attacked the parents of a former U.S. Olympian and their tour guide at the 13th century Drum Tower last Saturday, killing the father and severely injuring the others. The assailant then jumped to his death from the tower.

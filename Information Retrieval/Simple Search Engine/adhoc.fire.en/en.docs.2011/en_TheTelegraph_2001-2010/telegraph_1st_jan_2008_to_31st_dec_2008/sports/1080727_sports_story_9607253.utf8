	Hokkaido: Jeev Milkha Singh put himself in contention for a top-five finish at the Sega Sammy Cup after carding a four-under 68 that propelled him to tied fourth spot in the Japan golf tour event on Saturday.         
	Jeev now has a total of seven-under 209 and shares the fourth spot with three other.         
	Meanwhile, the penultimate hole bogey cooked Arjun Atwals goose and he missed the cut by just one shot in the $750,0000 nation-wide Childrens Hospital Invitational meet. (PTI)

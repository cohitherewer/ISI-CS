The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Citys 200m buy-out today
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Citys 200m buy-out today
            THE TIMES                      
	London: Sheikh Mansour will complete his 200m takeover of Manchester City Tuesday, but even that news was overshadowed by a 6-0 thrashing of Portsmouth at the City of Manchester Stadium that offered a tantalising glimpse of what may lie in store ahead.         
	We are lucky to have someone [in Hughes] who we believe is the best young British manager, Sheikh Mansour said. We are ambitious for the club, but not unreasonably so, and we understand it takes time to build a team capable of sustaining a presence in the top four of the Premier League and winning European honours.

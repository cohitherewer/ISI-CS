	The German head of state had done everything in its power to leave a taste of Nazi propaganda in the mouth of all the competing nations at the 1936 Games. Jesse Owens, born the son of a slave in 1913 in segregated Alabama, however, left his own mark which would turn Adolf Hitlers theory of racial supremacy on its head. Owens competitive period began in 1928 in Cleveland where his father sought work in order to feed his family of 11 children.         
	 The young James, known as Jesse, was first spotted by Charles Paddock, the Olympic 100m champion in Antwerp in 1920, then by a coach at the University of Ohio. Given a place thanks to his athletic attributes, the adolescent standing 1.80m tall and weighing 72kg soon exploded onto the athletics scene. In 1935, disadvantaged by a fall only days beforehand on a staircase, he practically had to be carried to the Ann Arbor stadium.         
	 That day he beat five world records in the space of an hour, and equalled a sixth: the 100 yards (9.4 - record equalled), long jump (8.13m), 220 yards/ straight track (20.3, world 200m record during race), and 220 yards/hurdles (22.6, world 200m record during race). Owenss long jump record stood for 25 years, his 100m record (10.2 on 20/6/36) for 20 years.         
	In Berlin, the new 100m world record-holder was keen to prove the equality of all human races. But as part of a 66-man American team which contained 10 black athletes, Owens proceeded to turn this act of moral justice around by proving his own superiority.         
	The 100m, 200m, long jump (ahead of the Aryan German Lutz Long, who would later become a close friend!) and 4x100m relay titles would all fall into Owens hands. Yet, after humiliating the Nazis, it was his own countrymen who caused him concern. At first suspended for complaining about the American athletes conditions, he was then banned for life for having turned professional.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       IPL biggest match-fixing threat: Richardson

	New Delhi: International Cricket Council (ICC) has expressed concern over multi-million dollar Indian Premier League (IPL) being susceptible to match-fixing because of twin reasons of excessive cash involved and the hype surrounding it.         
	ICC general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson said Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) chief Sir Paul Condon, in a presentation at the annual conference in Dubai, has warned that IPL brings with it the biggest threat to the game in terms of corruption since the days of cricket in Sharjah.         
	We are concerned. Lets face it, the IPL is the first domestic competition which has attracted such huge interest, and when it does, its going to inevitably going to attract the interest of match-fixers and people like that, Richardson said.         
	And because of the interest created, there is no doubt that we would be concerned if the BCCI neglected that part of the game and didnt make sure that they had very strict measures in place to ensure doesnt take a foothold in the IPL or any other domestic competition for that matter, he said on Thursday.         
	Richardson said Condons presentation was an attempt to inform the member boards on what is the current situation of corruption.         
	The purpose of the meeting and having the briefing from Condon is to keep the members informed and so the message was clearly accepted by the BCCI. (PTI)

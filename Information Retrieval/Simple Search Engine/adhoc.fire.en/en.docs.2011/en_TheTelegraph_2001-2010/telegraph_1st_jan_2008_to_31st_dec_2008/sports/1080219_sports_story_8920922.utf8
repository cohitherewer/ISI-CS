The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Now Clark unwilling to tour Pak 
                                                   Now Clark unwilling to tour Pak 
            SHARP SINGLES - Down Under                
	 Stuart Clark is the latest player to express concerns about touring Pakistan next month. According to The Australian, Clark said: Everyones concerned about it. Anyone going to Pakistan would be concerned at the moment. Were still not quite sure whats happening. Were waiting for CA to make a decision.         
	Australia are due to play three Tests, five ODIs and a Twenty20 International. According to the newspaper, Australias players have already made it clear privately that they will not tour Pakistan. PCB officials have been making seemingly fruitless, last-gasp attempts to keep the tour alive by meeting CA officials during ICC meetings in Malaysia.         
	Moodys choice         
	 Former Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody is keen to have Adam Gilchrist in his Mohali IPL team. Moody, who became the first coach to sign up for the Preity Zinta-owned Mohali franchise of the IPL, said he would love to have the champion glovesman in his side. Every franchise would be itching to secure him. We are not any different, Moody was quoted as saying in The Australian.         
	Watson for county         
	 Injury-plagued Australian allrounder Shane Watson says he is looking for more cricket and sees playing for an English county as his chance to return to the international arena.         
	Watson had two short stints with Hampshire in 2004 and 2005 and is keen to return to the Shane Warne-led side for a longer deal. He has received encouragement from CA officials so long as he keeps to a rehabilitation programme.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Caution the EB watchword

  - AFC Cup tie vs Al Wihdat 
  -  Till we reach the quarters, I dont believe in talking big, says Aloke         A STAFF REPORTER             East Bengals Debabrata Sarkar (left) tries to control the ball while Surkumar Singh and Alvito DCunha look on during a practice session at the club ground on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Its rather strange. One would have thought that after beating Al Wihdat 2-0 at their backyard in Amman, East Bengal would be brimming with confidence ahead of their AFC Cup return leg match at home against the Jordanian club.         
	But going by what one saw on Tuesday, the eve of the tie at the Salt Lake Stadium, the red and golds looked cautious almost to the point of lacking in self-belief.         
	The customary practice session on Tuesday was predictable. The warm-up followed by a game of sepak takraw and focus on set-piece movements. The way the players seemed relieved when coach Aloke Mukherjee decided to wrap it up by 9.30am, indicated that the heat wont be a problem for the visitors alone.         
	If one expected a little bit of swagger from the coach of a team sitting pretty at the top of group B with six points and on the verge of a quarter final appearance, Mukherjee was a study in humility.         
	We have to be very careful, he said at the pre-match news conference. They are the best foreign side that we have faced so far.         
	Moreover, after our victory on April 2, expectations on us have increased manifold. Nobody gave us a chance in Amman. Now that we have won the fans would be looking for an encore at home, Mukherjee said, sounding a trifle wary.         
	Asked if he would be going all out on Wednesday, the East Bengal coach said: Why should we? The onus is not on us. We will go all out only after ensuring there are no loopholes in defence.         
	Though Syed Rahim Nabi is carrying a calf-muscle niggle, Mukherjee stressed that he wouldnt disturb the winning combination.         
	Nabi will play. I want to maintain the same XI that took the field in Amman.         
	He also seemed reluctant to take credit for a turnaround in East Bengals fortunes. I did nothing. All credit to my boys, he said, adding: If anything, I have repaid the clubs faith in me This wouldnt have been possible had my boys not supported me.         
	There were no shortages of words of caution.                     
	We would do well not to dwell on our achievements. Till we reach the quarters, I dont believe in talking big. But I have 110 per cent confidence on my boys that they will deliver.         
	Captain Alvito DCunha, never shy of speaking his mind, seemed cautious as well.         
	They have six national team players in their XI. We have to watch out for Nos. 9, 13 and 20. Besides, they are a very good unit and there is no question of taking them lightly.         
	One away win doesnt ensure a last-eight berth, Alvito said, adding: They have nothing to lose really. We expect them to go all out. After all, three wins from their remaining three outings can still see them in quarters. So         
	But he did maintain that the Jordanian side had underestimated them last time.         
	Dont know why but they did think we would be overawed. It was nice to prove them wrong, he quipped.         
	For their part, grappling with extreme heat and humidity, Al Wihdats assistant coach Gamal Mahmoud and captain Faisal Ibrahim blamed the last defeat on a lack of focus.         
	Our Jordanian premier league match was just around the corner and all my boys were distracted. Now that we have bagged the title (for the 10th time) we will go all out on Wednesday, Mahmoud said.         
	On whether East Bengal were a better outfit than the other teams in their group  Safa FC and Ahli Sanaa  Mahmoud said, we respect all the teams. Each team has their strengths But may I point out that instead of your team winning the last match, we had rather lost it.         
	Ibrahim was worried, expectedly, about the heat.         
	Its going to be very difficult but we would have to work around it We had missed four-five sitters in our last match. That wont be repeated, he promised.         
	East Bengal XI (likely)         
	Subrata Paul; Surkumar Singh, M. Suresh, Majek Bolaji, Debabrata Roy; Mehtab Hussain, Mehrajuddin Wadao, Alvito DCunha, Syed Rahim Nabi, Ibe Ike Gift, Edmilson.

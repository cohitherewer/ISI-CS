The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | When moms are champs
                                                                                                                                                                                             When moms are champs
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Dara Torres                           
	Beijing: Frailty thy name is woman. So said William Shakespeare. But over the decades several women have proved the Bard wrong. Women who overcame odds  and motherhood, which many consider the end of the road for an athlete  and showed the world that they have all it takes. That the Games are more about the triumph of the spirit, of mind over matter.         
	The Beijing Games can only but begin with a mention of the woman, who is, literally expected to make waves here, US swimmer Dara Torres. Forty one years of age and a mother of a two-year-old daughter, Torres won the first of her nine Olympic medals in 1984, a year before Michael Phelps was born! She broke the first of her three world records in 1982, when she was 14. She retired and returned thrice, her latest effort built on an obsessive attention to her ageing body.         
	I just want to go out there for all those 40-something-year-olds and show that age is just a number and go out and have fun, Torres said here.         
	She will now be the first American swimmer to compete in five Olympics (despite sitting out 1996 and 2004). Shell also be the oldest female swimmer in the history of the Olympic games. Torres, who will be participating in the 50m freestyle, 4x100 freestyle relay and if selected for the 4x100 medley relay, said: It is Tessa (her daughter) who I am doing this for. To show her that life has no boundaries if you commit to your dreams and never stop believing in yourself.         
	British marathon runner and glam mom Paula Radcliffe has also been much in the news lately, chiefly due to an injury, till she confirmed shell be in Beijing because she has unfinished business with the Olympics. It was not long ago that Radcliffe had been relegated to the ranks of those who had failed to live up to the promise shown. This despite her 2003 marathon world record of 2hrs 15min 25sec. She ran three of the four fastest marathons in history but when, three miles before the end she stopped in Athens, she fell from grace. Then she got pregnant and was away for two years. And was seemingly relegated to history.         
	Proving all critics wrong she surged to win the New York marathon last year. It was giving birth and motherhood itself, said Radcliffe that has done much to strengthen her psychologically and will henceforth shape every aspect of her life. Motherhood has made me much more positive, said Radcliffe.         
	Despite her fitness concerns, US marathon medal hope Deena Kastor insisted that Radcliffe is still the woman to beat. Kastor, who won the bronze in Athens said: Shes the biggest competitor out there as far as Im concerned.         
	The one to set the trail ablaze was Dutchwoman Fanny Blankers-Koen, the Flying Housewife. She returned without a medal from the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The Second World War meant that it would be another 12 years before she would get a chance to participate on the world stage. By the time of the 1948 London games, Blankers-Koen was a 30-year-old mother of two and had been written off.         
	But over seven days at Wembley Blankers-Koen won the 100m, 200m, 80m hurdles and the 4x100m relay and silenced critics.         
	Her contemporary, Shirley Strickland de la Hunty, is another tale of a gritty mom. Shirley won seven Olympic medals during a career that spanned three games. Shirley took a break after the Helsinki games (where she won her first hurdles gold) in 1952 to have a son. When she began training again after her maternity leave, she found herself facing the same criticism as Blankers-Koen.         
	The critics claimed she was too old, she was a mother and her place was in the home. When a determined Shirley won the hurdles gold in the 1956 Melbourne Games, she became the first woman to successfully defend an Olympic title.         
	Then there was the Polish sprinter Irena Szewinska. Between 1964 and 1980 she participated in five Olympic Games, winning seven medals, three of them gold. A top class student, with a Masters degree in Economics she was also a model mother.         
	These spirited athletes have proved to the world that if you dare to dream, dreams still come true.

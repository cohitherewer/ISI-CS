            A CORRESPONDENT                       
	Sydney: Ricky Ponting gave his teammates a kick up the backside after losing the tri-series final No. 1 to India on Sunday and said the world champions needed to lift themselves to stay in contention. We need to recover as well as we can before Tuesday It is a hard work, but we have to lift ourselves, the Australian captain told a news conference on Sunday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Indias performances in Australia         
	India have played some pretty good cricket over the summer. There have been a couple of occasions when we havent made the finals, so some teams have done pretty well so farIndia have played good cricket in the Tests and have won two games against us in the tri-series too. They are the upcoming one-day unit, with the younger guys doing the job.         
	What will now be your plans to stay alive in the tournament         
	Its not very often that this series has gone into the third final. India obviously have their noses in front after today. It is a hard work, but we have to lift ourselves. Whichever team is switched on, come Tuesday, will have a better chance.         
	What did you tell the boys in the dressing room after the defeat?         
	I gave them a kick up the backside...Weve got to quickly get back on the horse... We pride ourselves on our performances, but came up short... The Indians outplayed us.         
	How would you describe Sachin Tendulkars innings?         
	Sachin had a few close shaves, but once he got past the new ball, he controlled everything beautifully He has the ability to sum up situations Its now about us staying one step ahead of him We need to start well and put some pressure on him on Tuesday.

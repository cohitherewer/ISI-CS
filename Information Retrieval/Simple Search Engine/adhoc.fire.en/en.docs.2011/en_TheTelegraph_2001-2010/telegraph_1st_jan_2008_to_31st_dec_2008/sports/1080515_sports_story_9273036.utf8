The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Im a believer... You cant shake my belief: SRK
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Im a believer... You cant shake my belief: SRK
    - Knight Riders owner salutes fans whove been respecting team           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan                                 
	Calcutta: Thursday will see the latest Shah Rukh Khan movie, Aditya Chopras Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, get on the floors. However, before the Kolkata Knight Riders owner left the city for Mumbai (after Tuesdays thrilling win over the Delhi DareDevils), he spoke to The Telegraph for around 15 minutes.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether Tuesday nights victory could be looked upon as the Knight Riders most important so far in the IPL         
	I think every win is crucial... Its important... Every defeat too will become crucial... Well get better by the time the last-four stage is reached.         
	The bowlers consistently scripting superb performances         
	Yes, indeed... Theyve been saying that Twenty20 is a game for batsmen, but look at what our bowlers have been doing... My children (Aryan, Suhana) didnt come because they had school, but theyd called to say Shoaib (Akhtar) would destory the Delhi Daredevils... He did... Such performances (four for 11 in three overs) help bind the team better.         
	His first words to Shoaib after the last wicket had been taken         
	Nothing much... That hed done it... Hes making up for lost time... After what he has gone through, it wouldve been enough if hed just played the match... Fact is he got four wickets and was the Man-of-the-Match too... I hope the performance does Shoaib good and does the people who believe in him good... Shoaib has the best bunch around him, in the team and outside... John, (co-owners) Juhi and Jay Mehta, my wife Gauri... We can help him to get rightness in life and Im haappy he heeded my advice and actually apologised to the Pakistan Cricket Board... Shoaib joined the team late, but is the most accepted.         
	The enormous confidence he has in his team         
	Look, Im a believer and you cant shake my belief... If you have to dream, then why hold yourself back? So, believe that youll be the champion... The Knight Riders have been showing a lot of character.         
	Knight Riders being smart in the field with a capital S         
	Im not saying were the best team in the tournament, but were certainly the best fielding unit... John (Buchanan, coach) and the others have worked hard to step up the fielding.         
	Whether hed been able to follow the Knight Riders sterling show in Hyderabad on Sunday         Of course... I was shooting for Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?... We broke off for an hour-and-a-half to watch the Knight Riders bat... Saw Sourav (Ganguly) lead from the front.   
	His amazing relationship with the fans of the Knight Riders         
	I dont behave like a star... I dont show off... A lot of people tell me that my stardom will finish (early) because Im such a normal guy... I dont agree, for I think being that alone will extend this stardom... Im not acting when Im with the team or at the Eden... Thats me... Its when Im acting, that Im Don or some other character... Ive developed a bond with the fans and theyre respecting the Knight Riders by turning out in such huge numbers... In thousands, really, at the Eden. My way of thanking them is to bow after every match.         
	Not having been able to perform at the Eden         
	I dont need to perform... The team itself is special (and draws thousands)... When we win the IPL, well come to the Eden and perform!         
	The shout of party as he entered his teams dressing room after the victory         
	Win or lose, weve been partying after the matches at the Eden... We had a party even after we lost to the Mumbai Indians... After John, Im the eldest and being in that position, I wouldnt ever like to give the younger players the impression that were down... Thats why the loss to Mumbai made no difference. Even if wed lost to the Delhi DareDevils, the party wouldve been on.         
	Finally, the secret behind being able to smoothly slip in and out of different roles         
	(Grins) Its about focusing... What youre doing at any point in time has to be the most important thing in the world for you... Just that and nothing else... (After a pause) Rani (Mukherjee) was to have come to the match, but I didnt bring her along as she had a shoot on Wednesday... I knew shed get tired... I didnt want her to lose focus...

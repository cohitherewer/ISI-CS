                                                   Prasun speaks to Pawar

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: CAB president Prasun Mukherjee on Monday spoke to BCCI chief Sharad Pawar expressing the state associations concerns over Sourav Gangulys omission from the one-day squad. I spoke to Pawar earlier in the day and he shared our concerns, Mukherjee said. 
    
	I told him that we are shocked at the selectors decision. This is unthinkable after Souravs performance in ODIs last year, Mukherjee addd. 
    
	It is learnt that Pawar has promised to speak to the national selectors and ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on the issue. Mukherjee said that once the squad was decided, nothing could be done. 
    
	Meanwhile, Dilip Vengsarkar defended Sourav, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxmans exclusion. When we took it (selection) in our hands, we were No. 7 in the rankings. Now we are No. 2 and we hope that we will be No. 1 very soon not only in Tests but even in ODIs, Vengsarkar told a TV channel.

	New Delhi: Double trap shooter Ranjan Sodhi, who won a gold medal in the Belgrade World Cup recently, still stands a chance of participating in the Olympics. According to National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) secretary Baljeet Singh Sethi, the international shooting federation may grant Sodhi a wild card if some shooters from other countries withdraw before July 21.

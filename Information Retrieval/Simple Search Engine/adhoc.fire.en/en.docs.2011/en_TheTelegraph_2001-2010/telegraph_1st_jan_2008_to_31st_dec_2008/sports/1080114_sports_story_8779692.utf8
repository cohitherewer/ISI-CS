                                                   RCTC grapples with winds of change

      TAPAN CHAKI
           
	Deep in the mighty roar that rode with Christopher Alford and Regal Connection in that final furlong of the Hastings straight, the imaginative ear could detect another subtler sound. 
    
	You might have likened it to the passing of a light breeze through the leaves of a venerable tree. But I think it would have been more accurate to associate that rustling to the fingering of betting cards and tote vouchers across the sardine packed grandstand. 
    
	Regal Connection at 5 to 1 was the common punters coup and the men in dhotis and safari suits were preparing to collect a good 50m before the winning post. Their confidence boosted by the demonic driving of Alford who made it distinctly evident at that stage that the race was his for the taking. 
    
	This was Dipak Khaitans 16th Calcutta Derby, an unparalleled feat in the history of racing in this centre. The Khaitan familys association with the turf goes back several decades and they deserve a lot of credit for keeping the sport going in its bleakest years. Thanks to their initiative and sponsorship, Calcutta racing survived its worst period. 
    
	The sight of well proportioned thoroughbreds stretching every limb and sinew is always a joy to behold. By noon, there was a sizeable crowd. Hopeful owners, hard-working trainers, die-hard punters and of course the hollow cheeked, bow-legged band of jockeys  their blood tingling in anticipation of the thrills that lie ahead. 
    
	All through the afternoon much adrenalin flowed and for many, fortunes won and lost. It was an inspiring sight to see Naren Mukherjee of Behala, an amputated leg and in crutches, enthusiastically surveying the horses as they paraded in the paddock. 
    
	I have been coming to every Derby, ever since Wiseman won it in mid-50s. At that time I accompanied my father, now I come with friends, he said, brushing aside the physical discomfort of standing on one leg amid a jostling crowd. 
    
	If you were a champion tennis player, took part in the Wimbledon in the 40s, survived a world war, if you are an octogenarian as K. B. Madan is now, you are entitled to give sports a beady eye. 
    
	Understandably, its a rheumy old eye. But its not a dull or an unaffectionate one. Maybe a trifle keener on the past than the present. 
    
	In my minds eye I can picture the scene as it was in the 40s and 50s. Gentlemen in spats and women in ankle length grown and fancy hats. There were quite a few outstanding jockeys  Edgar Britt, Harry Carr, Bren Duffy, Wally Sibritt. 
    
	Among trainers, who can forget Goswell? The big name among owners was J.C. Galstaun. He had a very big string. Apart from him the other big owners were N. D. Bagri, Chamaria and the Maharaja of Cooch Behar. 
    
	Although the proceedings of the dusty afternoon induced a flood of nostalgia, K.B. is strictly of today. Things have changed since my youth but there have also been many changes for the better. I am quite optimistic that we are heading for exciting times. 
    
	Yes, the times are a changing. Cyrus Madan, the chairman of the RCTC, is an ambitious and a combative character. 
    
	After a sequence of frustrating years, the RCTC is beginning to enjoy a change of fortune. The turnouts are encouraging. 
    
	To emphasise the changing trend, Cyrus said: New owners are coming into racing. Besides, we have owners from other centres More and more horses are being stabled here. 
    
	Its a tough task that the club has embarked upon. The RCTC, losing its position of pre-eminence, is a socio-economic factor, said the articulate Nandita Menon, corporate economic advisor. 
    
	There has been a demographic shift. The British and other expatriates who were patrons of racing have gone. The Anglo-Indians have migrated, the zamindars and Maharajas are no more. Add to this the Bengali middle-class prejudice against racing and that will explain the decline. 
    
	And decline there certainly has been by way of personalities. 
    
	Among the loveable characters being missed are the flamboyant Lenny Dorji, Daddy Mazda, joyous and restless, the warm and friendly Henry Au, and the urbane wit of Pearson Surita. They are no more.

                                                   Kumble: Well play in the right spirit
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Anil Kumble was candid on the eve of the three-Test series against South Africa. Indias Test captain said the game plan would be to put up enough runs on the board, which would automatically put pressure on the opposition.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The wicket         
	It seems a good surface typical Chennai wicket. It should be a batting track and as the game progresses spinners will definitely come into the picture. It will have good bounce and carry as well.         
	Shaun Pollocks absence         
	Obviously, South Africa would miss Shaun Pollocks experience and skill. But they have done well in the last couple of series in the subcontinent, so you should give them that credit. They have always been very competitive and have done well in India. Dale Steyn, (Morne) Morkel and Makhaya (Ntini) form a good bowling unit Dont forget (Jacques) Kallis. We would like to concentrate on our strengths and if we play to potential we definitely have the advantage.         
	The heat in Chennai         
	It will be the same for both teams, but I think we are more used to the conditions. We are looking to post a big first innings total and put pressure on the opposition.         
	Paddy Uptons presence         
	We have had some good sessions He has also been chatting to some of the players individually, so it has been a good start.         
	The break following the series Down Under         
	We have been playing a lot of cricket. The guys who have not been a part of the one-day side have played the Deodhar Trophy.         
	Maintaining the No.2 spot in rankings         
	We want to continue the good work that we did in Australia. This is the beginning of what will be a long season for Test cricket. I think we are ready to ensure that we go out there and do our best. It is important to do that time and again in Tests because every session counts, every day counts and we have done that throughout in Australia. We are really confident going into this series. If we do well and win this series it will definitely give us a bit more lead in keeping that spot.         
	Aiming for the No. 1 spot         
	That is definitely a huge incentive. Individually, some of us seniors have achieved a lot but as a unit it is important to ensure that Indian cricket moves forward. We have that opportunity. Having said that, we would like to take one series at a time and ensure that we start well and then take it forward. To win any Test, whether at home or away, it is important to bat well and we have ability to do that. This is how we won matches and we would like to continue that way.         
	On if he has received a letter from the ICC on sledging         
	I did receive a letter from the ICC. But I think we are all capable and responsible enough to understand where the line is and I am sure cricket will be played in the right spirit. I think everybody understands that it is good to have a healthy banter on the field Whatever happens on the field remains on the field. I think we are all mature enough to understand that. I am sure my teammates understand that and we will definitely play in that way in this series and in the future too.

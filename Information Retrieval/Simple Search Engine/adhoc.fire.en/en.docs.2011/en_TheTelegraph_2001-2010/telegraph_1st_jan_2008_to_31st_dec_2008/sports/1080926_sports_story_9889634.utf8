The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | RCA defends stand
                                                                                                                                                                                           RCA defends stand
                      
	Mumbai: BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi Thursday came out in defence of the decision of the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) to provide top-class training facilities to the visiting Australian team at Jaipur.         
	BCCI CAO Ratnakar Shetty had objected to top-class facilities being extended to Australia, saying India were never given such facilities abroad.         
	I dont see anything wrong in it. This is a unique year in that Australia had time on their hand with the cancellation of the Champions Trophy. They wanted to get acclimatised to our conditions and wickets and approached me (as RCA president) and I saw no reason to deny them, Modi said.

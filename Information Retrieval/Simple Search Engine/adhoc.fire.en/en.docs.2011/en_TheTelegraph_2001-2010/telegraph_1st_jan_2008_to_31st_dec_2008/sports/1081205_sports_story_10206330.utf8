The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tevez is the hero 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tevez is the hero

	London: Carlos Tevez scored four goals for Manchester United against Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday as they joined holders Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-finals of the League Cup.         
	United rested several big names but were too good for Rovers at Old Trafford with Argentine striker Tevez running the show in a 5-3 victory in the only all Premier League clash of the quarter finals.         
	Tottenham, who beat Chelsea in the final last season, fell behind against Championship (second division) side Watford but hit back to win 2-1 at Vicarage Road.         
	Tevez headed United into the lead from close range and Nani made it 2-0 before halftime.         
	Benni McCarthy gave Rovers hope early in the second half but Tevez replied from the penalty spot and then finished off a sweeping move in style.         
	Rovers mounted some late resistance with Matt Derbyshire and McCarthy making it 4-3 but Tevez completed a great individual display with a screamer in stoppage time.

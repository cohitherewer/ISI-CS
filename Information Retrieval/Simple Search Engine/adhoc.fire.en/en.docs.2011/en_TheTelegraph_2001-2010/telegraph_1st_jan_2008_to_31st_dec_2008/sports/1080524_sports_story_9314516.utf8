	Calcutta: With only a night left for Bayern Munich to arrive in the city, demands for passes have soared for Tuesdays friendly between the club and Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium. Preparations are on to welcome the great Oliver Kahn and his men. The 23-member squad will reach the city at noon on Sunday and the German great, who will be offered an honorary life membership by Mohun Bagan, will meet reporters later in the day. Kahn is scheduled to hang up his boots after this match.         
	Some of the Bayern Munich players will also inaugurate the Calcutta Police-organised para football Friendship Cup to be held at the Bodyguard Lines. About 550 teams from across the city will take part in the first round. Bayern, who are on a nine-day promotional tour of Asia, easily won their first match against Indonesia. They won 5-1 in Jakarta on Wednesday with Schlaudraff scoring a hattrick.         
	Its an honour for us that such a great player like Kahn will be playing his last match here. We will do our best so that the team enjoys its stay here, Kumar Shankar Bagchi, managing director of the Bengal Peerless Group, said on Friday during the unveiling of the trophy that will be presented to Kahn. He also announced the German clubs schedule.

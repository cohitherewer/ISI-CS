                                                   Ivanovic likes new surface

           
	Hong Kong: World No. 4 Ana Ivanovic believes the new surface at the Australian Open is slower but less likely to cause injuries. 
    
	Organisers of the years first Grand Slam tournament, scheduled for January 14-27, have replaced the Rebound Ace court surface at Melbourne Park with Plexicushion. They expect the new surface to produce a lower ball bounce and retain less heat. 
    
	Speaking at a press conference Tuesday for the JB Group Classic exhibition tournament in Hong Kong, Ivanovic  who is a frequent visitor to Melbourne  said she has tried out the new surface. 
    
	I find it quite slow but its very good for the body. Its quite soft, the Serbian player said. World No. 5 and former Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova said over the weekend she was looking forward to the new surface because players were prone to injuries on Rebound Ace when the court got sticky in hot conditions.

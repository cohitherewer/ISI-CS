	London: Left-arm spinner Samit Patel took five for 41 and scored 31 runs to lead England to a 126-run victory over South Africa in the third ODI at the Oval on Friday.         
	His all-round efforts and an unbeaten 78 from Andrew Flintoff off 77 balls enabled England to clinch the five-match series 3-0.         
	Patel, playing only his fourth one-day International, shared a 74-run partnership with Flintoff in Englands impressive 296 for seven after acting South Africa captain Jacques Kallis had won the toss and elected to field.         
	England got off to an electric start courtesy Ian Bell, who hit 73 off 77 balls and put on 101 for the first wicket with Matt Prior (33) off 15.2 overs.         
	But the hosts suffered a top-order collapse losing Bell, Owais Shah (23) and captain Kevin Pietersen (5) in quick succession.         
	Their dismissal brought Flintoff to the crease and the all-rounder produced some punishing strokes to take England to an impressive score.         
	Flintoff survived a blow to the head from a Morne Morkel delivery midway through his innings to strike nine fours and a six.           (REUTERS)

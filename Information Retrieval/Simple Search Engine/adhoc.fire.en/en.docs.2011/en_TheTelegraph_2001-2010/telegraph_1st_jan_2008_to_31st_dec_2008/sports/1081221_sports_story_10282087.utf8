The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Swann, Flintoff limit damage
                                                                                                                                                                                           Swann, Flintoff limit damage
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Mohali: Off-spinner Graeme Peter Swann triggered a top order collapse in the post-lunch session to keep England in business at the end of day two of the second Test match on Friday.         
	On a day when a huge 314-run second wicket partnership between two centurions  Gautam Gambhir (179) and Rahul Dravid (136)  presented India with all the opportunities to post a mammoth total, Swann scalped three quick wickets to halt the smooth progress.         
	Eventually, India, who were 320 for one till 20 minutes after lunch, settled for a total of 453. The two England openers did make an appearance but walked off accepting the umpires offer of bad light.         
	In a dramatic change of events in an hour after the lunch, India lost four of their frontline batsmen in a span of 12 overs with Swann alone accounting for three. To make matters worse for the hosts, Andrew Flintoff trapped a struggling V.V.S. Laxman (0) leg before.         
	After a productive morning session, when Gambhir and Dravid hammered 123 runs without getting separated, the next two hours were a study in contrast. In 28 overs between lunch and tea, India lost four wickets and could manage only 54 runs.         
	It was not any better for the Indians in the post-tea session as well, when they lost the remaining wickets for the addition of only 97 runs. After Swann struck the vital blows, Monty Panesar and Flintoff polished off the rest of the batting line up.         
	Swann, the 29-year-old from Nottinghamshire, was unperturbed by the fact that fellow spinner Panesar was receiving the stick from the Indian batsmen. He maintained a good length, constantly changed his line and was finally rewarded with the big wickets of Gambhir, Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar.         
	There was a period when the Indian batsmen looked invincible with Gambhir and Dravid treating the bowlers with scant respect. Dravid, overnight 65 not out, was back in his old mode and picked up runs with some scintillating hits to the fence.         
	Dravid, who duly completed his 26th Test hundred, his first in 20 innings, had his share of luck in the morning session. At least twice he edged dangerously through the slips.         
	The former India skipper finally reached the three-figure mark with a single off James Anderson. It was a pity that only a couple of thousands were present in the stands to watch one of Indias greatest batsmen score his first Test century in nine months.         
	True to his nature, Dravids was a muted celebration as he just raised the bat and shook hands with Gambhir. He didnt even take off the helmet.         
	Gambhir, on the other hand, looked good enough for a double hundred but lost his wicket in a rush of blood, trying to go for a big hit off Swann. Alastair Cook held on to the catch at backward point.         
	After the departure of Gambhir, wickets fell quickly. Dravid was the next to go as he was caught by Panesar off Swann at deep mid wicket. Sachin Tendulkar (11), who received the usual rousing welcome from the spectators when he walked up to the wicket, was trapped lbw by Swann.         
	Indias trouble would have been deeper after Laxman departed without scoring a run in 24 deliveries. Local hero Yuvraj Singh (27) was on eight when he was dropped by Cook at gully.

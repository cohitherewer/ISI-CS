            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjuna Ranatunga                           
	Colombo: The buzz is that former Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chairman Thilanga Sumathipala is working overtime to dislodge Arjuna Ranatunga, who got the job earlier this year.         
	Sumathipala is very keen to get back and he remains quite influential, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	Sri Lankas only World Cup-winning captain has been appointed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, but its learnt that Sumathipala too has pretty close links with the countrys No.1 man.         
	The straight-talking Arjuna, by the way, is a Member of Parliament and thats quite significant. As for Sumathipala, hes reputed to be very strong financially.

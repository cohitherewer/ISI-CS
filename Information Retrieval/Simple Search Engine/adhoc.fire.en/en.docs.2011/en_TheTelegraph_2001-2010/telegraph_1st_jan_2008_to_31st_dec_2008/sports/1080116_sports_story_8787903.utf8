	Mumbai: Six-time champions Delhi will take on 2005-06 winners Uttar Pradesh in the five-day Ranji Trophy final from Wednesday. 
 
	Delhi, with an array of experienced batsmen in their ranks, hold a distinct advantage over UP who started slowly before picking up momentum to make the final at the neutral venue.
 
	Delhi captain Gautam Gambhir, who is expected to make the India ODI squad to be picked here on January 20, and Aakash Chopra are capable of giving the lower-order batsmen the right platform against the varied, but largely inexperienced, UP bowling attack.
 
	In bowling too Delhi seem to hold the cards with the availability of left arm pacer Pradeep Sangwan who grabbed 28 wickets in the league phase of the tournament before missing the semi-final against Baroda as he was part of the India U-19 team now in South Africa.
 
	Sangwan, Parvinder Awana, Amit Bhandari and first change new ball bowler Rajat Bhatia have been in good nick. The spin department has been strengthened by the inclusion of seasoned campaigner and former India ODI bowler Rahul Sanghvi.
 
	We wanted the bowling attack to have an all round look which was lacking and thats why we included (left arm spinner) Sanghvi, Delhi coach Vijay Dahiya said Tuesday.
 
	We had not done well as a team though around 10 to 12 boys had gone on to play for India. We are totally focused on winning the title and play in the same manner whether Mithun Manhas is the captain or Virender Sehwag or now Gautam Gambhir, Dahiya said.
 
	His words explained why Delhi, with so much talent in the ranks, have not won the Ranji Trophy since 1991-92 or even reached the finals since the first and only day-night summit clash they lost to Mumbai in Gwalior in 1996-97.
 
	UP skipper Mohammed Kaif, who was instrumental in beating Saurashtra in a low-scoring semi-final, praised the Wankhede grassy wicket that has been prepared for the final here by ex-India opener Sudhir Naik.
 
	Its a very good wicket, but the only grouse is such wickets need to be prepared from the U-17 levels, Kaif said.
 
	Kaif gave credit to his inexperienced bowling line-up, which has an exciting new ball bowling talent in Sudeep Tyagi, for bringing the team back into contention in the later part of the league and against Saurashtra in the last-four. We are thinking only about winning the Trophy and not about India spots. We have a balanced side and have done well after struggling a bit initially and were even in danger of being relegated at one stage, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal hope to earn a point vs Safa
                                                   East Bengal hope to earn a point vs Safa
                      
	New Delhi: East Bengal will have to come up with a hugely improved performance if they want to return unscathed in their first match of the AFC Cup against Safa Sporting Club in Beirut on Tuesday.         
	Coach Aloke Mukherjee said his boys would try and ensure that they dont lose and would then think of earning full points when their opponents visit Calcutta.         
	Well aim for a draw. Since it is an away match, grabbing a point will put us in an advantageous position. We can then go all out for a win in the home tie, the coach said before the teams departure.         
	But considering East Bengals poor form in the I-League and the IFA Shield, it wont be easy for them to even split points against the side who are placed fifth in the Lebanese premier league.         
	Safa have been the middle-ranked team but they have four to five players in their national squad which beat India in the World Cup qualifiers last year, besides having a dangerous trio of Africans in their ranks.         
	East Bengal would clash with Sanaa at the Salt Lake Stadium on March 18, and travel to Amman to lock horns with Al Wihdat on April 2. Back home, the red and gold brigade face the Jordanian outfit on April 16, before facing Safa on April 30.         
	THE SQUAD         
	Subrata Paul, Gopal Das, Surkumar Singh, Anupam Sarkar, Majek Bolaji, M Suresh, Poibong Poshna, Debabrata Roy, Mehrajuddin Wadao, Mehtab Hussain, Ike Ibe Gift, Snehashis Chakraborty, Alvito DCounha, Hardeep Singh Saini, Edmilson Marques, Syed Rahim Nabi, Dipendu Biswas, Vimal Pariyar.         
	Coach: Aloke Mukherjee.           (PTI)

  - Champions T20 League scheduling 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) president David Morgan has called a meeting of the ICC Board for Wednesday, August 6, to discuss implications of the timing of the Champions League T20 tournament, an ICC press release confirmed on Tuesday. The meeting will take place by telephone hook-up.         
	The Champions League T20 tournament is set to start on September 29, which is also the scheduled reserve day of the final of the ICC Champions Trophy to be held in Pakistan.         
	An ICC spokesman said: All our directors are committed to the principle of the primacy of ICC events and every one of them wants the ICC Champions Trophy to be a successful, premium-quality tournament. On that basis the directors will consider whether, and if so how, the Champions League will impact on that desired outcome, given its proposed start date of 29 September, the reserve day of the ICC Champions Trophy final.         
	The ICC Board consists of the chairman or president from each of the 10 Full Members plus three Associate Member representatives. Also present at ICC Board meetings is the ICC president, who chairs proceedings, the ICC chief executive officer and the ICC vice-president. ESPN/Star who hold the global rights to all ICC events were contemplating legal action against the ICC to prevent it from ratifying the Champions League.         
	Officials of the broadcasters were pre-empting that the ICC meeting on Wednesday will see majority of the boards confirming the Champions League dates.

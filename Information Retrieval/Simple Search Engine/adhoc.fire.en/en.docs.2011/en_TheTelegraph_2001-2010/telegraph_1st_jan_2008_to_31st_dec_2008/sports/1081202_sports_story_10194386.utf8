The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fisichella hails McLaren deal
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fisichella hails McLaren deal

	New Delhi: Laughing off suggestions that his race seat is in danger, veteran driver Giancarlo Fisichella hailed Force Indias recent technical partnership with McLaren-Mercedes for the next year, calling it a giant leap forward by the Vijay Mallya-owned outfit.         
	Fisichella said he recently got his contract renewed and all the talk of either Pedro de la Rosa or Paul di Resta replacing him was gossip.         
	I originally signed a two-year contract which was reviewed in September to incorporate the McLaren deal. In a few words, the team offered me a better car and a different package, Fisichella told the official Formula One website.         
	I accepted their proposal and both sides signed the new document between Singapore and China, he added.         
	Fisichella said the management kept him in the know of things about Pedro de la Rosa test driving the VJM01 car for two days at last weeks Barcelona test and hence it was not a surprise for him. The only thing I know is that in September we were told that Pedro could test and we could not say before it was made official, so I was not at all surprised.         
	As for the rest, I am not really interested in F1 gossip, said the Italian. Asked what would be his plan B in case Mallya tinkers with the driver line-up, Fisichella said: The line-up has been announced in China in October by Vijay, and I trust people who trust me.         
	Looking back at Force Indias debut Formula One season, Fisichella said finishing without a point hurt.

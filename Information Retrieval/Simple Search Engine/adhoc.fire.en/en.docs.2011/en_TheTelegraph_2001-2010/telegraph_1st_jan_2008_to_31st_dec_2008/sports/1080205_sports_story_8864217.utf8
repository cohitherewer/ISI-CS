      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: South Africas Shaun Pollock has signed off from one-day cricket in style by reaching the 500-mark in the allrounders chart in the ICC player rankings. 
    
	Pollock, who has retired after 303 ODI appearances and inspiring his side to a 5-0 win over the West Indies, grabbed six wickets and scored 43 runs in the series that helped him finish on 501 points, an impressive 128 points clear of second-placed Sanath Jayasuriya of Sri Lanka. 
    
	Pollock also finished off as the top bowler. His 393 wickets, 4,056 runs and a third place in the all-time ODI bowlers list behind Joel Garner of the West Indies and Sir Richard Hadlee of New Zealand makes him one of the greatest ODI allrounders in the history of the game.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former world No. 1 Carlos Moya has confirmed his participation in the Chennai Open to be held from January 5 to 11 in Nungambakkam.         
	This will be the Spaniards seventh appearance in eight years in a tournament he has won twice (in 2004 and 2005). He missed out on a hattrick when he was defeated by Ivan Ljubicic in the final.         
	The world No. 42 joins a star-studded line-up that includes Bob and Mike Bryan, Mahesh Bhupathi, Mark Knowles, Leander Paes, Lukas Dlouhy, Nikolay Davydenko and Stanilas Wawrinka.         
	Confirming his participation, Moya said: This will be my seventh visit in the last eight years. I always look forward to coming to Chennai. I love the courts and the crowd always supports me. I just want to come here and give my best.

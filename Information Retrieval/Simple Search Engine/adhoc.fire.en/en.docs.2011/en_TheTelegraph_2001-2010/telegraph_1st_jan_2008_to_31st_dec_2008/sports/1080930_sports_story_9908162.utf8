                                                                                                                                                                                           Cyclist faces ban
                      
	Rome: Italian cyclist Riccardo Ricco, who admitted he took blood booster EPO before this years Tour de France, could face a 20-month ban after being charged by Italys anti-doping body on Monday.         
	A statement from the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) said a 20-month suspension was being sought by the anti-doping prosecutor and that a tribunal would make the final decision. A two-year ban would normally be requested but his admission meant the prosecutor felt he merited a reduced sentence.         
	Ricco tested positive in a doping control after the fourth stage of Julys three-week race and soon admitted his guilt.         
	I think I have made a good gesture for everyone to have admitted my mistakes, Ricco said when he appeared before the CONI prosecutor in July.         
	The 25-year-old also warned that testing procedures needed to be looked at.         
	During the Tour they made a lot of tests, they made 10 tests in about 13 legs, two were positive and in fact in theory all the tests should have been positive therefore the method needs to be checked, he said.         
	The rider was kicked out of the race and sacked by his Saunier-Duval team, who also left the Tour.         
	Fellow Italian Leonardo Piepoli was sacked by Saunier-Duval at the same time as Ricco despite passing a dope test. Team bosses said they were unhappy with his answers when he was questioned about doping.

	Zurich: Evander Holyfield, 46, has no intention of quitting the ring if he wins the World Boxing Association (WBA) crown against Russian champion Nikolai Valuev in Switzerland next month.         
	(My) goal is to be undisputed heavyweight champion of the world and not just one title, said the veteran American at a news conference.         
	I never thought I would be fighting at 46, maybe 34 at the most. I guess in 1999 I thought it was over after losing to Lennox Lewis, said Holyfield. I truly believe this is my year and I am honoured to have the opportunity to fight Valuev and I will be the world champion.

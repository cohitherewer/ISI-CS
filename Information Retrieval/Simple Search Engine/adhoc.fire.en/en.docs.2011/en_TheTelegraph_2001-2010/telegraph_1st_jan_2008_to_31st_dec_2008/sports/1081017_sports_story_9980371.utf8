	Calcutta: Bob Houghton on Thursday revealed his plans for Indias preparation for the AFC Asian Cup 2011 tournament. The national football coach on Thursday had a meeting with coaches of East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	According to Houghton, seven national camps will be held over the next two years. While the first camp will be held in January, the second one will be in March. The next two will be in July and November, respectively. In 2010, the three camps will be held in January, March and July.         
	Our aim is to have the camps on a regular basis. Last year we had a camp in September and then in June this year. This was a long gap. This wont help, he said.         
	Houghton stressed chalking out his fixture on a white board.         
	Simultaneously, there will be pre-Olympic camps in July and November 2009.         
	Houghton emphasised on changing the countrys domestic football structure. If the I-league is strong then we could take a giant step forward Japan did it This should be done with a clear and cohesive plan, he said.         
	Asked whether he would be looking for any foreign tours as part of Indias AFC Asian Cup preparations, Houghton said an invitation from Thailand (the Kings Cup) was already there. Besides, he would prefer to play some exhibition matches with the Gulf countries.         
	We have selected 14 opponents in Asia. We would like to play with countries that are ranked between 6 and 20 in Asia. This will give us a feeling of where we stand, the coach said.

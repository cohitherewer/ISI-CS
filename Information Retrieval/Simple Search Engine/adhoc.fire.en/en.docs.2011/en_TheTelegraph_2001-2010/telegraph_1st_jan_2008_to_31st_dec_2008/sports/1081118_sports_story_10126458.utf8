	Indore: The Board of Control or Cricket in India (BCCI) wants the first Test against England at Ahmedabad deferred by a day to allow Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni play in the Champions T20 League final if his team  Chennai Super Kings  make it to the title-contest.         
	The first Test is scheduled from December 11 in Ahmedabad a day after the Champions League final at Chennai.         
	I can confirm that an approach has been made by the BCCI to put it off by a day, but no decision has been taken so far, Englands media manager Andrew Walpole said on Monday.         
	Walpole also indicated that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was not likely to respond to the BCCI request.

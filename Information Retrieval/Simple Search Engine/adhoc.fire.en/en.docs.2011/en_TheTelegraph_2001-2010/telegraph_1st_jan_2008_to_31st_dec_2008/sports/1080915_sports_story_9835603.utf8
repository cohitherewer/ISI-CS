The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak captain yearns   for some cricket 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Pak captain yearns   for some cricket 
                                    
	Karachi: Lack of international action prior to the tour to India could affect Pakistan cricketers performance, feels captain Shoaib Malik.         
	I hope we will get to play a couple of series before the Indian tour because when you dont play cricket for some time, then it is very difficult to stage a comeback against a strong opposition, said Malik here on Sunday.         
	The Pakistan captain was talking to reporters after returning home from Johannesburg where he took part in the shooting of a Bollywood film.         
	He said lack of international cricket was affecting the players and hoped they would get busy in the domestic season, scheduled to start from the first week of October.         
	Malik who appeared in the film with Kamran Akmal, Sohail Tanvir and Rao Iftikhar said he had agreed to play a small part as it gave a message to youngsters who falter after doing well initially.         
	The film tells them that the players should not get involved in activities that can damage their careers, he said.         
	Pakistan vice-captain Misbah-ul Haq had echoed similar sentiments before leaving for Delhi on Saturday.         
	Misbah said lack of international cricket had left the players rusty and they were all desperate for some competitive action.         
	But Misbah sees no point in cribbing and says as professionals, he and his teammates would have to overcome the problem and deliver the goods.         
	India are scheduled to play three Tests and five ODIs in Pakistan during January-February next year but after the postponement of Australia tour and the Champions Trophy, Pakistan hardly have any international assignments at their hand.         
	Yes, we will be under-prepared for the India series because we would hardly play Test cricket and get to face top quality teams in ODIs as well. But as professional cricketers, these problems should not bother us. We need to prepare ourselves for every eventuality, said Misbah, after a practice session of the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines team here on Sunday.         
	Misbah also said that politics has no role to play in cricket and only acts as a barrier in the development of the game. I think sports should never be mixed with political issues, it should be kept aside because at the end of the day it is cricket which suffers.         
	Of course the postponement of Australia series and Champions Trophy has affected the game in Pakistan. The series against Australia was very important for us, not only from the players perspective but also from the general audiences view, he said.         
	After the Australia series postponement, Champions Trophy was our only hope. And after the successful hosting of Asia Cup, we were pretty confident about the Champions Trophy, the 34-year-old middle-order batsman conceded.         
	It is frustrating that we will play just a Test this year and even our one-day appearances have mostly been against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. The players definitely need more exposure, he added.         
	Misbah was of the view that every international cricket team should be committed to their foreign tours.         
	According to me, every team should play everywhere irrespective of situation, he said. (AGENCIES)

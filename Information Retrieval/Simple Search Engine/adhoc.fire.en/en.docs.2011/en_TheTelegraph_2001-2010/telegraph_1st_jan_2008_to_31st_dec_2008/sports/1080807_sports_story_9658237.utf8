The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Selectors decided, but for one slot
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Selectors decided, but for one slot
  - Parthiv could be 16th player for ODIs in Lanka       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Colombo: The national selectors, one learns, have more or less decided on 14 players for the five-match ODI series in Sri Lanka and next months Champions Trophy in Pakistan.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Dilip Vengsarkar and his colleagues arent sure only about who should take Yusuf Pathans place. Irfans elder brother made it to the last two tournaments  tri-series in Bangladesh and the Asia Cup in Pakistan  but didnt make an impression.         
	By the way, we lost in both finals.         
	The selectors, who will be meeting in Mumbai on Thursday afternoon, may pick a 16th player (possibly a second keeper in Parthiv Patel) exclusively for the ODIs in Sri Lanka.         
	As of late Wednesday, Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan were set to make a comeback. Robin Uthappa, Piyush Chawla and Manpreet Singh Gony face the axe.         
	Injuries kept Sachin and Zaheer away from recent ODIs  both have been featuring in the ongoing Test series  while Harbhajan missed the last tri-series and the Asia Cup as the tournaments were held during the period he was banned for slapping Sreesanth.         
	Chawla, however, could keep his place if captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni asks for him and the selectors pick the youngster for that 15th slot.         
	Apparently, Subramaniam Badrinath and Virat Kohli are also in contention for that one position. Much will depend on the combination the captain wants, one of the sources pointed out.         
	The 14 certainties (as of late Wednesday): Sachin, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh (vice-captain), Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma; Dhoni (captain); Irfan Pathan; Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha; Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar.         
	Sreesanth isnt being talked about, as nobody is quite sure about his fitness.         
	Meanwhile, owing to a change in plan, chief selector Vengsarkar wont be coming here for the series-deciding Test.

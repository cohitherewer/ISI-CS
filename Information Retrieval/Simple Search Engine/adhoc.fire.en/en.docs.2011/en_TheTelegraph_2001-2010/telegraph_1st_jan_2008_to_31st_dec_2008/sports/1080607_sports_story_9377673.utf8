                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sreesanth doubtful for tri-series
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sreesanth                           
	Calcutta: A side strain has put Sreesanths participation in doubt for the tri-series in Bangladesh.         
	According to BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, Sreesanth suffered the injury during the Indian Premier League  Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals tie in Mohali  and has been advised to see the medical team at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore.         
	Sreesanth has got a left side strain from the last IPL game in Mohali. This is confirmed by MRI scans and currently he still has some effusion in the region. Sreesanth is planned to join the Indian team for the Bangladesh tour tomorrow, the BCCI said in a release on Friday.         
	At present, he looks doubtful for the Bangladesh tour. His availability for the tour will be decided after his assessment at the NCA, Shah said. There was no confirmation, but it is likely that Manpreet Singh Gony will be the replacement in case Sreesanth fails to make the cut.         
	Gony had been selected for the Emerging Players Tournament in Australia from July 14. Besides India, New Zealand, South Africa and the host nation will participate in the meet.         
	Sreesanths injury will only make the cricket boards more wary about releasing players for the IPL. The ECB has already voiced its concern.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PHL unlikely this season
                                                                                                                                                                                                     PHL unlikely this season
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The fifth edition of the Premier Hockey League (PHL) is unlikely to be held this season, according to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) sources.         
	The PHL is generally held during the months of December-January every season.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Thursday, a member of the IOA ad hoc committee for hockey said: I am sure we will have to forgo the tournament this time. The committee is definitely not ready to host it.         
	The now deposed Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) launched the PHL in 2005.         
	IOA insiders, however, said it would have been difficult to stage the PHL since it is still a separate entity with both K.P.S. Gill and K. Jyothikumaran part of it as directors.         
	There are legal problems as well, as the IHF has gone to court challenging the IOAs decision to suspend it, said an official.

      STAR RACER
                  
	Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh is again expected to rule the roost in another showpiece card of nine events at the RCTC on Wednesday. The fields promise a heathy competition but Vijays champions are well placed to deliver the goods despite the rival quarter having been reinforced with crack riders like Prakash, Mallesh and Chauhan. The presence of big names always inspires Vijays stable jockey C. Alford to do well.
     
	Vijays best prospects appear to be the two prized events  the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup and the 1,400m Indian Champagne Stakes. The schoolers money minting-machine, Aperitivo, also seems to be heavily favoured by the terms of the Champion Cup. The former Calcutta Derby winner may face some challenge from the younger generation horses  Priapus and Steal The Glory  but he is capable of handling them.
     
	The Champagne looks in the safe-keeping of Vijays Accalia who impressed immesely in her debut win over stablemate Arcology who, despite his weight advantage of 3.5kg does not appear to be a proper match for the Diffident-Amantran daughter.
     
	The 1,100m Republic Cup may see a four-cornered contest among Mystic Force, King Cole, Cool Magic and Thousand Stars. The last named is trained by the jockey-turned-trainer, Rutherford Alford, who is sure to go full steam on Day I of his new profession with four runners spread out in the card.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 3 paddlers to join Sharath
                                                                                                                                                                                           3 paddlers to join Sharath
                      
	New Delhi: Three top Indian paddlers will join the Beijing Olympics-bound player Achanta Sharath Kamal in an ongoing training-cum-exposure programme in Spain.         
	The trio  Subhajit Saha, Jubin Kumar and Pathik Mehta are leaving for the European country to participate in the special training programme. Sharath, the only Indian male paddler who booked a Beijing berth and presently ranked 79th in the world, is already in Spain.         
	It will be a very good experience for us to participate in the training programme, where scores of foreign players, besides some members of the Spanish team, will also take part, Subhajit said.         
	National coach Aleksey Yefremov, who had to postpone his journey with the team due to visa-related problems, talked high about the importance of such programmes.         
	Such camps are always helpful to teach the tactics and techniques of table tennis. It also adds to their experience as well, he said.         
	The Indian paddlers will return home on July 31.         
	Meanwhile, the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) is looking for another good European candidate to assist the incumbent national coach Yefremov to provide intensive training to the paddlers in the large country.         
	TTFI secretary D. R. Choudhary said on Tuesday that the federation would hold a meeting with the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and sports ministry representatives later this month to finalise the proposal.         
	We have requested Yefremov to recommend names of some good coaches from the European countries. The appointment will certainly make it easier for us to conduct training camps round the year and tracing out the talents much more effectively as well, Choudhary said.

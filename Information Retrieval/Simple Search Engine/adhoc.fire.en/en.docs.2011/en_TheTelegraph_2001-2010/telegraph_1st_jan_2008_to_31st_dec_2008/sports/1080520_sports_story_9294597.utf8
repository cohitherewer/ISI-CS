The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal dents Federers French ambitions
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nadal dents Federers French ambitions
            MARK HODGKINSON            Rafael Nadal                           
	In France, Rafael Nadal is known as The Ogre. And Andy Roddick has observed that Nadal just goes out there and punishes people. Nadal crushes opponents, forehand by forehand by topspin forehand.         
	The Ogre won the Hamburg Masters on Sunday, and in doing so inflicted some psychological damage on Roger Federer ahead of the French Open.         
	Of course, the final would have been very different if Federer, with a 5-1 lead, had closed out the opening set. But Nadal is unrelenting, and he won six games on the trot to take the set, and then went on to score a 7-5, 6-7, 6-3 victory that reversed the result from last years Hamburg final, gave him his first title at the Rothenbaum Club, and demonstrated once more his extraordinary qualities on the surface.         
	The French Open starts on Sunday, and Federer would dearly like to win a first title on the red clay of Roland Garros, but his confidence must be fried after the manner of his defeat in Germany.         
	What must be of great concern to Federer is that, during last months final in Monte Carlo, he had led 4-0 in the second set only to lose the set and the match. So, on clay this season, Federer has failed to make the most of good positions he has had against Nadal.         
	Federer has now lost eight of his nine clay-court meetings with Nadal, with his sole victory coming in last years Hamburg final.         
	The world No. 1 is very much second banana on clay, and it will take something very special to stop Nadal winning a fourth successive Coupe des Mousquetaires in Paris.         
	Perhaps Federers best chance of winning the French Open would be if Nadal and Novak Djokovic are drawn in the same half, and the Serb knocks the Majorcan out in the semi-finals. Federer has won just one title this season on all surfaces, the Estoril trophy he picked up last month after Nikolay Davydenko couldnt complete the final due to injury.         
	Nadals only defeat on clay this season came against Juan Carlos Ferrero in his opening round in Rome the week before Hamburg. But there he had been hampered by blisters on his feet, and perhaps should not have played. He has won three titles, in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and now Hamburg  and perhaps he would have won Rome if those four tournaments hadnt been bunched together in a four-week stretch, a scheduling issue that has had Nadal on his soapbox for a month or so.         
	Even Indiana Jones movies dont contain as many twists and turns as the first two sets of Sundays final. Nadal started slowly, and it was clear that he was still feeling the effects of his three-hour-plus semi-final against Djokovic on Saturday, a match he had to win to prevent the Serb from ending his three-year residency as the world No. 2.         
	Federer must be hurting. Soon the tennis world will gather in Paris, and the Swiss must try to get over his beating against the Ogre of the clay courts.

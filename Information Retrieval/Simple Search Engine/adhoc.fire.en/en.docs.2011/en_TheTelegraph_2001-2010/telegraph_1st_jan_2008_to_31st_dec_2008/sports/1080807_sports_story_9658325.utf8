            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Jockey C. Alford does it again, dropping hands to lose another race from a winning position. On Wednesday, Alfords over-confidence took a beating again atop Vijay Romantic Quest, who had no business to loose the Regal Bear Handicap but surrendered the race to the Pat Quinn-ward Italian Splendour. The jockeys action also triggered a riot-like situation in the race stands. Alford is learnt to have admitted his guilt, prompting the RCTC stewards to let off the jockey lightly with only a two-day penalty for a crime not long ago, the Bangalore Turf Club had slapped on him a six-month suspension.

	Bangalore: Team India Test captain Anil Kumble said he was optimistic about Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led sides chances in the Asia Cup that started in Pakistan from Tuesday.         
	He said that if the boys maintained the same tempo which they had during the last edition of the tournament, trophy wouldnt be an impossible dream.         
	If the team can perform like the last edition of the meet, there is no reason why we cant win the trophy, Kumble said here after attending the fitness camp for players ahead of the tour of Sri Lanka commencing July 23.         
	The veteran leg-spinner also made it clear that the recently-concluded Indian Premier League will not have any adverse impact on Test players who are professional and capable of adjusting.         
	On the fitness camp, he said it was his suggestion to hold the session in the city because of the pleasant climatic condition. (PTI)

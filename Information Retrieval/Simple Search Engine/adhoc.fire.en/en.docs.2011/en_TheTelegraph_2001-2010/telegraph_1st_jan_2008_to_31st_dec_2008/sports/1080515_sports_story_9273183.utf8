                                                                                                                                                                                             India ready to take on Pak 
                  Sandeep is in good form                     
	Ipoh: Buoyed by back-to-back wins over Canada and Belgium, a resurgent India will take on an as yet unbeaten Pakistan in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament on Thursday.         
	The much-anticipated match is crucial for India as a win will boost their chances of a respectable finish in the event, while for Pakistan another victory would give them a place in the final.         
	Pakistan, under the new coach Naveed Alam, have been in excellent form, winning three while drawing against Argentina 3-3.         
	Their forward line looks formidable with 14 goals in just four matches, making it a phenomenal performance for a side that finished sixth here last year.         
	However, India coach Ajay Kumar Bansal is unperturbed by their arch-rivals remarkable run.         
	We have to win. If we have to go anywhere near a medal, this win is a must and my boys are aware of this, he said. I think we will be able to put it across Pakistan.         
	Bansal felt with both Sandeep Singh and Diwakar Ram in good form, the Indians have a real chance of ending Pakistans unbeaten run. There is no reason why they cannot be successful tomorrow. he said.         
	Pakistan coach Alam is, however, cautious in his appraisal. We will look at the contest beyond the results. Our aim is to showcase the game for which we both are known for, he said.         
	The India coach, meanwhile, is busy looking for chinks in Pakistans armour.         
	Their wingers are experienced, midfielder Saqlain is going great guns. However, we will not mark individuals instead we would deploy zonal marking because Pakistans whole forward line is good including Shakeel Abbasi, Rehan Butt and others. But I will tell you one thing. Their scoring abilities are not taxing my mind. We are looking at the game in totality, how to control the game and play for winning.         
	Alam, on the other hand, said his side was motivated and attacking game was their strength. (PTI)

	Lee earns $80,000 per wicket  Melbourne: Brett Lee returned home as the richest Australian cricketer, taking home a whopping $80,000 per scalp for his four wickets from as many games in the cash-rich IPL. The paceman was bought for $900,000 at auction and earned more than $320,000 for his brief stint with the Punjab side. Ricky Ponting, who went for a relatively modest $400,000 to the Kolkata Knight Riders, has emerged as the highest-paid Australian batsman when earnings are worked out on a rupees-per-runs-scored basis. Ponting earned $3663 for every run, or $142,000 for the four games he played.     
	Dalmiya for Speed  Calcutta: Former International Cricket Council (ICC) president Jagmohan Dalmiya has termed the expulsion of Malcolm Speed as an ldquo;unfortunate rdquo; incident, says A Staff Reporter. In a statement, Dalmiya said: ldquo;The image of the ICC has taken a beating. What has transpired over the last few weeks cannot be good for any organisation and certainly not for the ICC. rdquo;    
	 McGrath firm  New Delhi: Glenn McGrath has not lost any of the tricks of his heydays and looks the same old menacing pacer but the Australian insists he has no plans to come out of his retirement from international cricket. Brushing aside chances of a comeback, McGrath said: ldquo;Not at all... Four overs a match is just fine for me. I came here for 6-7 weeks of cricket and I rsquo;m happy where I am, rdquo; said the Australian.     
	Kallis hopeful  New Delhi: In a bid to promote the IPL, the BCCI is using strong arm tactics against the rebel ICL, but South African allrounder Jacques Kallis feels that all these leagues cropping up will ultimately benefit the game in the country. ldquo;Both IPL and ICL are beneficial for Indian cricket because it is the domestic players who will get to learn a lot from it. rdquo;      
	Saheba denial  Mumbai: Umpire Amish Saheba has denied having talked to any reporter on the controversy in his reply to the show cause notice issued to him by the BCCI. ldquo;He (Saheba) has categorically denied giving any kind of interview to the publication in question in his reply to the show-cause notice issued to him by the BCCI, rdquo; BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said.     
	 Lehmann wish  Melbourne: Australian Cricketers rsquo; Association president Darren Lehmann, who came out of retirement to play in the cash-rich IPL, believes the Twenty20 venture would be ldquo;bigger and better rdquo; in its second season.

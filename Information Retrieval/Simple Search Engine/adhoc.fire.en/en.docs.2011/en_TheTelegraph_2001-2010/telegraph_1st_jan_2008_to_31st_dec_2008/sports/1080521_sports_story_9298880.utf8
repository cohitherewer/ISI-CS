The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cristiano must deliver to prove he is the best
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cristiano must deliver to prove he is the best
            Henry Winter in Moscow            Cristiano Ronaldo                           
	Cristiano Ronaldo jetted into the Russian capital Monday night, claiming to be simply the best, but only when the self-confident Portuguese re-boards Manchester Uniteds charter will he know whether he deserves Tina Turners husky serenade.         
	Victory over Chelsea on Wednesday, spiced with a starring role, and the debate is over. But he must deliver. Ronaldo faces a 90-minute, possibly two-hour, audition for greatness in the Luzhniki.         
	Uniteds fabulously gifted No.7, the type of ball-using magician who makes youngsters fall in love with the game and adults stay smitten, remarked last week that awards show that I am the greatest, sparking a race among more seasoned chroniclers of the beautiful game to reply domestically.         
	Ronaldo, prince of the Premier League, must now parade his undoubted talent on the grandest club stage of all, the European Cup final, before being crowned king.         
	He should heed the wise statement of his manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, a shrewd authority on what is required to earn footballs leading man Oscar. Kakas performance in the Champions League final against Liverpool possibly won him the vote as European Footballer of the Year last year, reflected Ferguson, but this season there has been no one to match Ronaldo.         
	Point of order: the Ballon DOr is voted on over the calendar year, so Euro 2008 and a good start to next season count. If Michael Ballack turns Red Square blue and then drives Germany to Euro 2008 glory, then he may well eclipse Ronaldo in the individual stakes for all the United wingers pyrotechnics in the Premier League.         
	The 50-odd Ballon DOr judges from across Europe, including this observer, closely inspect the leagues on their doorsteps when casting votes for five players but a strong Champions League showing, or World Cup/European performance, carries immense weight.         
	So when he glides on to the Luzhnikis hastily-laid pitch, stamps his foot down into the uneven grass like a bull preparing to charge, Ronaldo must beware one nightmarish headline forming like a threatening aide-memoire in his mind, sharpening his wits for battle: the headline that reads Ballack DOr. Chelseas No. 13 is in menacing form, his injury problems behind him, a summer of huge potential stretching out in front of him. If United are not careful, Ballack could run Wednesdays match.         
	Within football, most people want Ronaldo to shine ahead of Ballack. Irritation persists over the occasional tumble, and particularly the I dont believe youve not given me the foul strop when referees wave play on. Ronaldo would win more friends, among onlookers and officials, if he jumped back up after losing the ball, rather than taking on the English justice system. Get on with it, man.         
	For all the histrionics, Ronaldos armoury of drag-backs, nutmegs, and rich variety of routes to goal make him special.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

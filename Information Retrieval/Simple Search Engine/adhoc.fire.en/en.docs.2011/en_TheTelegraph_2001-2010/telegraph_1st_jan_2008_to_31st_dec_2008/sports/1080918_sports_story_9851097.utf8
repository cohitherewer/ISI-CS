The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 481 million tag on Newcastle
                                                                                                                                                                                                     481 million tag on Newcastle
                      
	Mike Ashley on Tuesday night placed an astonishing 481 million price tag on Newcastle United as he launched an audacious bid to sell his crisis-torn club to Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.         
	Should Ashley succeed in selling the club for that price  revealed in a detailed dossier on Newcastle presented to Sheikh Mohammeds representatives on Monday  it would represent a handsome profit for the sports retail mogul.         
	It has been suggested that there is only a slim chance of the club changing hands  and then only if Ashley drastically lowers his price, which would probably see Newcastle being valued at between 250 million and 300 million.

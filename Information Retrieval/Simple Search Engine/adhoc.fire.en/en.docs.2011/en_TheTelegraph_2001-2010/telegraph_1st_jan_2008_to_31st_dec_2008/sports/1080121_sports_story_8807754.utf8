                                                   Selection policy puzzles Deep

      A STAFF REPORTER
                 
	Calcutta: The city-based cricketing fraternity, including CAB president Prasun Mukherjee, expressed shock over Sourav Gangulys exclusion from Indias one-day squad for the triangular series in Australia, scheduled to start from February 3. 
    
	The following are their reactions (alphabetically): 
    
	SAMBARAN BANERJEE: Its an unfortunate decision. I really dont know what the selectors are up to Is there any logic behind dropping a batsman who is in good form? Sourav batted well throughout the Pakistan series. Its fine if the selectors look for a young side but you cannot do this at the expense of a player like Sourav. 
    
	The squad seems to have been selected for some Twenty20 meet! He has faced this kind of crisis earlier and I am confident that he will come back. 
    
	DEEP DASGUPTA: The selectors policy is beyond me. They could have announced the ODI squad after the Adelaide Test. We are standing in a crucial point when the series could be levelled. 
    
	I dont support the timing of the announcement nor the logic of axing seniors like Sourav and Rahul. Why was Dada dropped after such a good performance in the Pakistan series? You need the experienced guys like Sourav, Rahul when you will be playing a month-long tournament. 
    
	DEVANG GANDHI: It was totally unexpected. He is not only in good form but also consistent. I feel that the selectors have done a big mistake by dropping Sourav. You cannot ignore a player who has played more than 300 ODIs. 
    
	They shouldnt have treated him this way. Sourav is a strong person and will surely make his way into the one-day team again I feel he should focus on the Adelaide Test and prove the selectors wrong. 
    
	ARUN LAL: The selectors could have given Sourav another series. But I understand what they are looking for and this is a positive approach. You cannot expect anything more from Sourav You cannot compare todays Sourav with what he was ten-year back. If you want Sourav in the team then what about Dravid, Laxman and Kumble They have reached the end I think Sourav should reconsider his comeback. 
    
	PRASUN MUKHERJEE: I am surprised I didnt think that Sourav could be dropped from the one-day squad. Since his comeback he has been so consistent. He is a typical ODI player. People has written him off in the past but I believe as long as he is fit he will continue playing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand stays in second spot
                                                   Anand stays in second spot
                      
	Nice: World champion Viswanathan Anand won the blindfold but lost the rapid game against Magnus Carlsen of Norway to remain in sole second after the end of the seventh round of the Amber Blindfold and Rapid Chess tournament here.         
	The Indian ace suffered his first ever defeat against Carlsen in a rapid game after winning the blindfold and fell a full point behind Levon Aronian of Armenia in the combined standings after the latter defeated Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria 1.5-0.5.         
	While Aronian took his combined tally to nine points from 14 games played so far, Anand is now on eight points. Carlsen, Peter Leko of Hungary and Vladimir Kramnik of Russia are a half point adrift of the Indian and share the third spot jointly. Anand improved his blindfold standings and jumped to joint second on four points behind Russian Alexander Morozevich who has 5.5 points to his kitty.         
	The rapid section still has Aronian in sole lead on 5.5 points while Anand and Leko share the second spot with four points apiece. (PTI)

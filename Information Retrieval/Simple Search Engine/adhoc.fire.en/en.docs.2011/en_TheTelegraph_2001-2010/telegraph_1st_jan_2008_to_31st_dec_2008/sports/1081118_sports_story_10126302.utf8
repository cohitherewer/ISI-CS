The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Focus isnt a problem, says Krish Srikkanth 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Focus isnt a problem, says Krish Srikkanth 
  - Yuvi definitely a frontrunner for Test slot: Chief selector       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Srikkanth                                 
	Calcutta: Chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth doesnt share predecessor Dilip Vengsarkars rather negative views on Yuvraj Singh, who has produced two absolute gems (in Rajkot, Indore) within four days.         
	Both, by the way, are former India captains.         
	Ive never felt Yuvi has a problem focusing on what hes required to do... Ive always seen him as a confidence-player and such players need a couple of good knocks under their belt, the Chennai-based Srikkanth told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Monday evening, an hour after Yuvraj walked away with his second MoM award in as many ODIs, Srikkanth added: I see Yuvi as a potential match-winner in Tests too... Over the years, he has already shown hes a match-winner in ODIs.         
	Vengsarkar, who was in the chair when Yuvraj got dropped from the Test squad in July, didnt have anything positive to say on the eve of the ongoing series against England.         
	Yuvi is extremely talented, but he lacks the focus required to excel in international cricket, he told a TV channel.         
	Significantly, Yuvraj declined to react (weve been advised by the Board only to speak at press conferences), but a confidant did offer a comment on Super Monday. Performances talk and Yuvis contribution in the first two ODIs speaks loud and clear...         
	The confidant added: Yuvi is coming off tough months... Dropped from the Test squad, removed as the vice-captain in ODIs... Tell me, how could he have performed, and not just in one match, if he wasnt focused?         
	Point there.         
	Back to Srikkanth... Asked whether Yuvraj, whose last (23rd) Test appearance was in April, had now positioned himself firmly for the slot vacated by one-time mentor Sourav Ganguly, he replied: There are others in the running as well, but Yuvi is definitely a frontrunner.         
	That Rahul Dravid is struggling even in the Ranji Trophy, and doesnt seem a certainty for the first Test against England, next month, is bound to strengthen Yuvrajs case.         
	Complimenting Yuvraj for his performances in Rajkot (a blistering 138) and Indore (a classy 118 and four for 28), the effervescent Srikkanth said: He has been brilliant... Rajkot had a batting track, but the Indore wicket was on the slower side and Yuvi had to first hold the innings together... He proved that he can be a match-winner from any situation... As chief selector, Im very happy...         
	Yuvraj turns 27 during the first Test (in Motera) and, hopefully, there will be reason for him to celebrate big. Without compromising on the focus bit, that is.         
	Clearly, Yuvraj has to make the most of every opportunity at the Test level if hes to figure in Fab Four II. Right now, Virender Sehwag and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are the only ones assured of featuring in it.         
	Yuvraj has to target one of the remaining slots.

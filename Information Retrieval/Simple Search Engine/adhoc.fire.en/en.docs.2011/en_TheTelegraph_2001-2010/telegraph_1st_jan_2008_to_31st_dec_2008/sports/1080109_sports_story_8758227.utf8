	Federer withdrew from the eight-man invitational event on Monday with a stomach virus, though he said he expected to resume training later this week as he finalised preparations for next weeks Australian Open, the seasons opening Grand Slam.         
	Baghdatis lost in four sets to Federer in the 2006 Australian Open final and despite losing in the first round of the Chennai Open last week, he said making the final of the doubles with Frances Marc Gicquel had at least given him some match practice.         
	I didnt play too well in Chennai last week though I played good in the doubles, Baghdatis told a news conference, he added.         
	No, Im feeling really good and Im looking forward to playing some matches with the guys and having some fun and getting ready for the Open. The tournament, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2008, guarantees players three matches against a field stacked with top-10 players before the Australian Open.

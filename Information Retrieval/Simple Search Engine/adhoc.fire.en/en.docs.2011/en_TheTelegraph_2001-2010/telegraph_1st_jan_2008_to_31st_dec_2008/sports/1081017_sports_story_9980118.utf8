The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Top-order is the key: Buchanan
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Top-order is the key: Buchanan
                      
	New Delhi: Former Australia coach John Buchanan believes the fate of the Ricky Ponting-led Australia team in the ongoing four-Test series against India will depend on the form of its top-order batsmen.         
	I believe that it will be the performance of the top order that will decide the outcome of the series, Buchanan said.         
	(Matthew) Hayden, (Ricky) Ponting and (Michael) Hussey are the key players if Australia wants to post big scores. (Simon) Katich, (Michael) Clarke and (Brad) Haddin can bat around them and help the side score mammoth totals.         
	Hussey has been a prolific run-scorer for the Aussies. He adds the stability in the middle order and has been an outstanding performer over the past few years. It is almost a given that he will score heavily in the middle-order and win matches for his team, he was quoted as saying by a website.         
	Buchanan, however, defended a little bit of defensive tactics of the Australian team in Bangalore as part of their strategy, but said Ponting and Co. had only themselves to blame for the draw in the first Test.         
	Australia and India are among the three best sides in Test cricket. Australia were not able to finish off the Indian tail in the first innings and then in the second innings the Aussie pace battery failed to make early inroads. So they have themselves to blame for the draw, Buchanan said.

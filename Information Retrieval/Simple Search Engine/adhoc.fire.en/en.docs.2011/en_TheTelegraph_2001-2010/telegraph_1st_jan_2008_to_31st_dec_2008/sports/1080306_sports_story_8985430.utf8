The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Messis injury overshadows Barcelona win 
                                                   Messis injury overshadows Barcelona win 
                      
	Barcelona: Barcelona eased into the quarter finals of the Champions League after a quickfire strike by Xavi earned a 1-0 win over Celtic on Tuesday.         
	The midfielder put a rapid end to Celtics hopes of causing a second-leg upset when he steered the ball in at the near post after Silvinho had latched on to a cleverly disguised pass from Ronaldinho in the third minute at the Nou Camp.         
	Barcelona, who won the first leg 3-2 at Parkhead, had a host of opportunities to extend their lead but keeper Artur Boruc pulled off a string of fine saves. Some of the shine was taken off the first knockout round triumph when livewire Argentina forward Lionel Messi hobbled off 10 minutes before the break with a thigh injury.         
	Messi will be out for six weeks after tearing a left thigh muscle, the club said on Wednesday. Barcelona said he would continue with special treatment for the remainder of the season. Its very bad news, Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard told reporters. Hes really suffering as hes had this injury before.         
	In another match on Tuesday, Fenerbahce beat Sevilla 3-2 on penalties to make the quarter finals for the first time after drawing 5-5 on aggregate.         
	Goalkeeper Volkan Demirel saved three spot kicks to send the Turks through after Zicos side had survived a dreadful start at the Sanchez Pizjuan.         
	Sevilla, who had lost 3-2 in the first leg, stormed into a two-goal lead inside nine minutes with goals from Daniel Alves and Seydou Keita.         
	Fenerbahce pulled one back through Deivid midway through the first half only for Sevilla to strike again just before the break when Frederic Kanoute restored the two-goal cushion.         
	Deivid scored again in the 79th to force extra-time, but penalties were needed to separate the sides. (Reuters)

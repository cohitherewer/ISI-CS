	Magny Cours: Felipe Massa led a Ferrari one-two to win the French Grand Prix on Sunday and take the lead in the Formula One championship for the first time.         
	Massas third victory of the season, and eighth of his career, made the 27-year-old Sao Paulo driver the first Brazilian to lead the standings since the late triple champion Ayrton Senna in 1993.         
	Team mate Kimi Raikkonen led from pole but was overtaken by Massa just after the halfway mark when his Ferrari slowed with a suspected exhaust problem.         
	Massa took the chequered flag 17.9 seconds clear of Raikkonen.         
	Italys Jarno Trulli gave Toyota, mourning the death of former team principal Ove Andersson, their first podium finish since the Australian Grand Prix of April, 2006, after holding off McLarens Heikki Kovalainen in a thrilling chase to the line.         
	The two cars came close to banging wheels on the penultimate lap as Kovalainen tried in vain to pass.         
	Polands Robert Kubica finished fifth with Red Bulls Australian Mark Webber sixth.         
	RenaultsNelson Piquet finally took his first point in Formula One with seventh place ahead of team mate Fernando Alonso in eighth.         
	Massa now has 48 points to Kubicas 46 with Raikkonen ending a two-race barren run to move up to third place with 43.         
	McLarens Lewis Hamilton, who had been level with Massa in second place, finished 10th after starting 13th due to a 10-place penalty on the grid incurred for colliding with Raikkonen in the Canadian GP pit lane.         
	The 23-year-old Briton suffered a further blow when he picked up a drive-through penalty after 13 laps that dropped him from ninth to 16th place.         
	Hondas Briton Jenson Button was the only driver to retire from the race.         
	Meanwhile, Force India achieved its target of a double finish in the French Grand Prix with Giancarlo Fisichella bringing his car home in 18th position while Adrian Sutil was just behind at 19th.         
	This was the teams first double finish since Bahrain.           (REUTERS)

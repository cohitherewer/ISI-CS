The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina loses in semis 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Saina loses in semis 
                      
	New Delhi: Saina Nehwals semi-final outing in the China Masters Super Series turned out to be a lopsided affair as the ace Indian shuttler crashed out of the event after suffering a straight-game defeat at the hands of her new nemesis Zhou Mi in Changzhou.         
	Seventh seed Sania, who won the Chinese Taipei Grand Prix gold tournament a fortnight ago, was no match for her Hong Kong rival and surrendered 4-21, 19-21 in just 26 minutes.         
	Zhou had cut short Sainas campaign in the first round of the Japan Super Series event last week.         
	Zhou will take on local girl Lin Wang in the fight for the silverware. Lin prevailed over compatriot Yihan Wang 21-14, 18-21, 21-11 in the other semi-final.         
	Saina, who made it to the quarter finals of Beijing Olympics, turned out to be an easy prey for sixth seed Zhou as the Indian could not match her opponent in any aspect of the game.         
	Zhous played brilliantly at the net play and her smashes left the Indian gasping. The Hong Kong girl registered 11 smash winners, compared to Sainas five.         
	Zhous winners at the net ware also double the Indians number. She won 15 points at the net in the entire match, while Saina could manage only seven. (PTI)

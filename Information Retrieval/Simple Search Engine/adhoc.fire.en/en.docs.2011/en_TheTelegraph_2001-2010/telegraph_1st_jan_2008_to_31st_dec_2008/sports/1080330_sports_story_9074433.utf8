                                                     Sehwag timing unbelievable: Thorpe
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Graham Thorpe                           
	Chennai: Graham Thorpe was a member of the England team when Brian Lara made 375 and 400 not out in 1994 and 2004, respectively. Here on a TV assignment, he was hugely disappointed to see Virender Sehwag miss out on an opportunity to overtake the West Indians world record on Saturday. Thorpe, one of the most complete England batsman since the Graham Gooch-David Gower era, has played 100 Tests. He spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	How would you like to remember Sehwags 319?         
	Wonderful innings. Nice to watch People would have flocked to the stadium anywhere in the world to watch an innings like that. He played with freedom and maintained a fantastic tempo He attacked and did it in a brutal way. It was all timing and power. He would often take a breather in between because of the hot and humid conditions. The other impressive thing about his innings was his fitness. It was an astonishing innings.         
	Did a lapse in concentration led to his dismissal?         
	It happens Batsmen get out in this fashion It could be due to a good delivery or a lapse in concentration. I certainly wouldnt be critical of anybody who scores 319 for my team. Just look at the way he played... Yesterday he drove similar deliveries through covers for four, and today, there must have been some bit of tiredness creeping in.         
	What do you remember most about Laras innings?         
	There was a sense of predictability about them Dont forget they were both played in St Johns, Antigua I was very impressed with his focus and the mental and physical strengths he showed to bat for that length of time (766 minutes in 1994 and 778 minutes in 2004) That sheer class and belief in yourself that you can keep going all day. Even when youre in the opposition and somebody gets close to such a record you dont mind him achieving it Its a special occasion to be there and it would have been lovely to see Sehwag go past it... Then I would have possibly been the only one to see all three innings. Both Lara and Sehwags innings were impressive         
	How would you compare Lara and Sehwags innings?         
	Sehwag was more brutal Lara was certainly more controlled. He never hit the ball in the air. He never tried to hit fours or sixes when he got to milestones (laughs) Those are the sorts of things that stand out. Sehwags innings was a boost for the team. He later showed how humble he was when he said that he was playing for the team and wanted his place back Any cricketer who has been left out knows how special it is when you get back to playing for your country and you dont want to lose another opportunity. India have got twice the man he was before because he knows how it hurts to be left out.         
	What is the physical and mental impact of such knocks on the opposition?         
	Test cricket is a physical and mental game. As one starts scoring so many runs you obviously get physically and mentally tired. But you have to keep the fun element going         
	What impressed you most about Sehwag?         
	His timing. Unbelievable Also his belief to go after the bowling and play aggressive shots which few others can do in the world Sending the message across that he was here to rule the stage.         
	Can he break Laras record?         
	Yes, this man could have broken it today itself. Not too many players can do that. You also need certain other things in place  the pitch needs to be good along with your timing. I still believe he can do it because he scores quickly.         
	How would you describe Sehwags batting?         
	I wouldnt say he is arrogant but he has a style Hes fought hard to get back his place. He bats in an aggressive manner and he takes the initiative away from the opposition. That is what sport is all about.         
	Can anyone match him in world cricket?         
	There are lots of other exciting players in the world I wouldnt like to take names I dont like to compare players. I would just say Lara and Sachin Tendulkar were the finest players in my era. Sehwag is pushing himself into that category. He scores runs like only he can doTwo triple centuries is good enough to put you up there.

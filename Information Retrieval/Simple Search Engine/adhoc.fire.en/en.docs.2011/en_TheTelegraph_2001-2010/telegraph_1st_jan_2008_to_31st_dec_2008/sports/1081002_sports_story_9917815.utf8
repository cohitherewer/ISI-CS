The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mishra: Was expecting call 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mishra: Was expecting call 
                      
	Chennai: Amit Mishra, included in the India squad for the first two Tests against Australia, said he was expecting the national call for the past one year.         
	I am very happy after hearing the news. I was expecting the call for the past one year, said Mishra, who picked three for 55 in the second innings in India As 129-run victory over New Zealand A on Wednesday.         
	In the last four to five years, I have been putting in a lot of hard work, particularly after I was dropped from the Bangladesh series, he added.         
	The 25-year-old Delhi player edged out left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha for a berth in the spin department.         
	Mishra was earlier included in Indias Test squad to face the West Indies in 2002 but that time he did not get a game. He made his ODI debut against South Africa in Dhaka in 2003 and since then has played just three ODIs, scalping three wickets.         
	However, in first-class cricket, he averages a decent 25.21 with 289 wickets in 75 matches.         
	Mishra feels the reward was a result of his consistent performance in the domestic circuit and the inaugural Indian Premier League.         
	Playing for Delhi DareDevils, Mishra took a hattrick against Hyderabads Deccan Chargers.         
	It all started with the IPL. It gave me the platform to interact with greats like Shane Warne. I specifically worked on my loop and top spin, said Mishra, who idolises Anil Kumble and Warne.

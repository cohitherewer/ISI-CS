The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pole for Massa
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pole for Massa
                                Felipe Massa      
	Sao Paulo: Home-crowd favourite Felipe Massa took the pole position for the decisive Brazilian Grand Prix on Saturday, increasing his chances of overcoming Lewis Hamilton for the Formula One title.         
	Massa posted a qualifying time of 1 minute, 12.368 seconds, delighting the tens of thousands of fans at the 4.3-kilometer (2.6-mile) Interlagos track. Toyotas Jarno Trulli was second and Massas teammate Kimi Raikkonen third.         
	Championship leader Hamilton was only fourth fastest with his McLaren in a time of 1:12.830, ahead of teammate Heikki Kovalainens lap of 1:12.917. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, who was quickest in practice on Friday and Saturday morning, was sixth with his Renault after clocking 1:12.967.         
	Massa was fastest in the first part of the qualifying session and fourth in the second before managing a quick lap that was .369 quicker than Trulli in the end. Hamiltons slower time could be the consequence of a fuel strategy that gave him a heavier car in the time trial.         
	It was the sixth pole of the year for Massa, who is bidding to erase Hamiltons seven-point lead on Sunday. The Brazilian needs to win the race and hope Hamilton finishes sixth or lower.                     
	We have a pretty long race tomorrow, but its always better to start from the front, Massa said. We have a good car. We proved our car is very competitive here.         
	Massa also became the first driver to win three straight pole positions at Interlagos. He last started from first place at the Singapore Grand Prix in September.         
	The fans celebrated wildly when Massa climbed out of the car to salute them. Ayrton Senna was the last Brazilian to win the F1 championship in 1991.         
	Its so nice to be here, Massa said. Making the third pole in a row in front of this fantastic people. Its difficult to describe with a single word how Im feeling.         
	Several banners posted by fans around the track had messages supporting Massa and wishing bad luck to Hamilton. One of them read, in English, Hamilton: The lakes curve waits for you, referring to a turn at the Interlagos track just in front of a small lake.         
	Fans cheered loudly nearly every time Massa appeared on the big screens, and jeered just as loudly when Hamilton was shown.                     
	About 70,000 fans are expected for the race on Sunday. Fans even climbed on roof tops and tree tops outside the track to try to get a glimpse of the action on Saturday.         
	Massa won his home race in 2006 and was second last year.         
	The Brazilian could become the first driver to win a title in front of his home crowd since the inaugural F1 season in 1950, when Italys Giuseppe Farina won at the season-ending Italian GP. Massa could also become the first non-European driver to win the title since Canadas Jacques Villeneuve in 1997.                   
	Despite starting fourth, Hamilton remains with a strong chance to become F1s youngest champion at age 23. Alonso was 24 when he won it in 2005. Hamilton can also become the first British champion since Damon Hill in 1996.         
	Hamilton, F1s first black driver, doesnt even need to win Sundays race to clinch the title. If Massa fails to cross the line in first or second, he will automatically win the championship.         
	Hamilton blew the same seven-point lead last year in the decisive Brazilian GP. A mistake in the first lap and then a gear problem led to a seventh-place finish  good only for second in the standings, behind Raikkonen.         
	Hamilton is using the same engine he had when winning the Chinese Grand Prix two weeks ago, while Massa has a new one. Drivers are required to use the same engine in at least two consecutive races.         
	Warm weather was expected for Sunday, but rain showers during the decisive race were a possibility.

	Felipe Massa  
	 Born in Sao Paulo in 1981, Felipe Massa spent his formative years racing karts in his native Brazil. He earned himself his first Formula One tests with the Swiss-based Sauber team, which in turn landed him a race drive for 2002.  
	 Massa made his Grand Prix debut in Melbourne. A race later, he took his first championship point with sixth place in Malaysia. At the end of the year he opted to spend the following season testing for the team rsquo;s engine suppliers, Ferrari.  
	 Massa rejoined Sauber rsquo;s race line-up on a two-year contract for 2004, partnering Giancarlo Fisichella. Massa rsquo;s Ferrari connections came into play ahead of the 2006 season as he was announced as the replacement for Rubens Barrichello. It gave Massa the opportunity to partner the legendary Michael Schumacher.  
	 His first Ferrari points came with fifth place at round two in Malaysia. He captured his first Formula One victory in Turkey, where he also took his maiden pole position. Not surprisingly, Ferrari retained Massa for 2007 to partner Schumacher rsquo;s replacement, the highly-rated Kimi Raikkonen. He scored three wins and six pole positions last year.

	 Although Lewis Hamilton initially took up racing as a hobby, winning came naturally for the young British driver. By the age of 10 he was crowned the youngest-ever winner of the British Cadet Kart championship.  
	 McLaren rsquo;s Ron Dennis noticed his swift rise through the ranks and in 1998 he signed Hamilton to the team rsquo;s young driver programme. At once, the young British driver won a multitude of European karting titles with ease and by the age of 15 he was crowned the sport rsquo;s youngest number one.  
	 In 2002 he opted for the British Formula Renault series and finished third in his debut season. He took the crown a year later after 10 wins, nine fastest laps and 11 pole positions.  
	 In his subsequent move to the Formula Three Euroseries, Hamilton won the title in his second year. His foray into GP2 in 2006 proved equally thrilling as he won the title. McLaren decided late in 2006 to reward Hamilton with a race seat in a Formula One car. Hamilton won four Grands Prix in his debut season and led the championship for much of the year.

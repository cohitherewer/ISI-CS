The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kapil: Dont take Aussies lightly
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kapil: Dont take Aussies lightly
                    Kapil Dev                
	Jaipur: The Australians may be a lesser force after retirements by some star players but former India skipper Kapil Dev has cautioned Anil Kumbles men against taking the world champions lightly in the forthcoming four-match Test series.         
	Let them land and play here. Only their former players like Adam Gilchrist have branded them as inexperienced. That may be their ploy to remain underdogs, Kapil, who is here to take part in a business meeting, said.         
	The Australians are fighters and they would not concede anything easily. The series is going to be a hard fought one, he said.         
	The former all-rounder also said it would be unwise to write off Sourav Ganguly, who was not picked for the Irani Trophy, and felt he has the ability to stage a comeback.         
	He is a determined chap. But he needs to work harder to make another comeback. He still has some time and also fair amount of cricket left in him. He w ill have to work hard for it, said Kapil.         
	Kapil also sympathised with players who were banned by the Bangladesh Cricket Board for joining the rebel Indian Cricket League.         
	Any player in the world has the right to play any where. Stopping him from that is a crime and is unjustified.         
	Kapil also accused the BCCI of trying to monopolise cricket and felt it was wrong to brand any one joining ICL as a rebel. Both IPL and ICL are good for Indian cricket. Both are giving chance to many of those who dont get much opportunities, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clark laughs off reports of slide
                                                   Sharp Singles Down Under
            Clark laughs off reports of slide
                
	Fast bowler Stuart Clark on Monday said Australia were desperate to show they were still the worlds best after taunts from tri-series rivals India and Sri Lanka.         
	Opener Virender Sehwag claimed Australia were scared ahead of their loss to India on Sunday, while Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said other teams were finally catching up with the world champions.         
	I keep reading that certain members of their (Indias) team say we are scared and things like that and I find that pretty much laughable, said Clark.         
	They can think whatever they want and theyve made some bold statements. India are playing good cricket, but the guys are keen to show everyone that we are still the best team in the world, the Australian bowler said.         
	However, Clark said Australia were simply down on form for Sundays surprise five-wicket defeat.               
	Ian Chappell hails competitive India         
	 Former Australian captain Ian Chappell has lauded India for matching up to Ricky Pontings world champion side in the ongoing one-day series, saying the visitors have spiced up the tri-nation tournament with their competitiveness.         
	India beat Australia by five wickets on Sunday to go on top of the points table in the series also involving Sri Lanka.         
	It was a tough win for India but a very good one... I think the message that they have also sent to Australia, if they were not aware of it before they certainly are now, that India really do believe that they can beat this Australian side and I think that it has set up, once again, a very competitive series between these two teams, Chappell said.         
	They certainly have been the two teams that have competed the best and competed the hardest for a decade, and its a rivalry that is not showing any signs of fading away, he said.         
	Chappell described the Indian bowling as magnificent at the MCG and appreciated Ishant Sharmas never-say-die spirit.               
	Ishant can be the best: Fleming         
	Former Australian pacer Damien Fleming is so impressed by Ishant Sharmas exploits that he feels the beanpole Indian has it in him to become the best bowler around, according to a report in the Australian newspaper, Herald Sun.         
	Fleming saw Ishant repeatedly running through the Australian top order both in the Test and one day tri-series with home team captain Ricky Ponting running the risk of becoming his bunny.         
	Fleming, who has a Test hattrick, was glowing in his praise of the 19-year-old, expressing the belief that the lanky pacer could well become the premier bowler of his era, overtaking the likes of Australian spearhead Brett Lee and South African pacer Dale Steyn.         
	Hes going to be a big factor for Indias bowling stocks for years to come, Fleming said.               
	Oxenford to debut         
	Former Queensland first class player Bruce Oxenford will make his international debut as an umpire in the tri-series clash between India and Sri Lanka in Canberra on Tuesday, becoming the 36th Australian to do so.

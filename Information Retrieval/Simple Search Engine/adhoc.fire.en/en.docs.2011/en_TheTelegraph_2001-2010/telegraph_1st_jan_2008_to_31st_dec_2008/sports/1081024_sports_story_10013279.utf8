                                                                                                                                                                                                     Injury-hit Md. Sp. take on Mahindra
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Theodore Sunday is doubtful for Mohammedan Sportings match against Mahindra United on Friday.         
	He injured his knee in our last match against Mohun Bagan. His chances of playing tomorrow are 50-50. We will consult the doctors before taking a final decision on Theodore, coach Shabbir Ali said on Thursday.         
	Sheikh Azim will also be unavailable because of injury. Jyoti Kumar and Bimal Pariyar are being considered as likely replacements upfront.         
	We will have to make most of the home advantage. Well have to do something tomorrow, added Shabbir.         
	A lot will depend on Mike Okoro and the coach is drawing strength from the fact that United SC beat the former champions 3-1 a few days ago.         
	We didnt play well in the last match despite scoring early against Mohun Bagan. Bad luck has also played a part in our earlier matches. We hope to set the record straight this time, Shabbir said.         
	Suspended goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar will also miss out.         
	Over in Goa, a keen tussle is on the card when debutant Mumbai FC take on Sporting Clube de Goa in Fridays other I-League match at the Nehru stadium, Margao.         
	Both the teams have nine points each and also have the same goal average (plus three).         
	Sporting Clube de Goa, who have played four matches, one more than Mumbai FC, maintain the top spot on account of more number of goals scored.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My focus is now on the mens circuit: Yuki
                                                                                                                                                                                                     My focus is now on the mens circuit: Yuki
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Yuki Bhambri, having attained his career-best junior ranking of No. 2, said he would rather focus on his graduation to the mens circuit than aim at the boys singles top spot next season.         
	Having attained his career-best junior ranking of No. 2 with a stupendous performance in the prestigious Orange Bowl championships,         
	Its a tremendous achievement to be world No. 2. I never thought at the start of the season that I would be here by year end. Its a dream come true for me, but from now on I will focus on (mens) tournaments, Yuki, the first Indian to win the Orange Bowl, told The Telegraph from Miami on Monday.         
	The Indian has his eyes and mind firmly set on his future course. I will be playing the Australian Open Grand Slam junior championship and thereafter will focus on the mens circuit. I will play the junior tournaments but I will balance it. Mostly it will be the Grand Slams, otherwise the emphasise would be on the mens tour.         
	Not since Leander Paes No. 1 ranking in 1990 that an Indian has reached so high in the ranking list. Ramesh Krishnan was another Indian to be top ranked. But what makes it special for Yuki is that he is ranked No. 2 at the year-end.         
	They were both great players and Leander still is. If I could do a bit of what he has done, I will be happy, said Yuki, who won three titles in the last three months  the Osaka Mayors Cup (Grade A) and the Asia-Oceania championships (Grade 1) being the other two.         
	I had one of the best starts (reaching the singles semi-finals of the Australian Open) and that helped me a lot. I played well last week also (reaching the semi-finals of Eddie Herr championships) but this week was superb.         
	The youngster is aware of the tough journey ahead of him. I have been training regularly at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis academy (in Florida, US). Fitness is an important aspect where we Indians lack. I am working on it, he said.         
	Sixteen-year-old Yuki won the boys singles title of the year-end event in Miami by defeating local favourite Jarmere Jenkins 6-1, 6-3 in the final on Sunday. The Delhi lad came close to making it a double but lost the doubles final, with American Chase Buchanan, to Jenkins and Devin Britton 6-7 (7-9), 2-6 later in the day.         
	The year-ending Orange Bowl event is an important programme on the junior calendar and its previous boys under-18 singles champions include big names like Roger Federer (1998) and Andy Roddick (1999). Its a Grade A event, a rung below the Grand Slams.

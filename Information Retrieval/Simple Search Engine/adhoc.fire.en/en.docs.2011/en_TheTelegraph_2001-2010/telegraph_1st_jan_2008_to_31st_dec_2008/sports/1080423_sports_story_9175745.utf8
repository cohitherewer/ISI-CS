The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ODIs rules need change: Akram
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ODIs rules need change: Akram
                  Wasim Akram                     
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram believes one-day cricket will need to undergo some changes for it to survive in the wake of the rising popularity of the Twenty20 format.         
	Akram said he, at times, got bored watching 50-over matches in the middle stages and there was a definite need to bring about changes in the rules to revive one-day cricket and make it more exciting and watchable.         
	Twenty20 cricket is gaining popularity because it is exciting cricket and it is aimed at the younger generation who want to watch high class sport in three to four hours, Akram said.         
	Twenty20 cricket is good for the future of the game but at the same time it is not quality cricket. It is simply entertainment. And to protect the real competition like one-dayers or Test matches, the ICC needs to think about revolutionary rule changes.         
	Akram said the idea of Test cricket under lights was not a bad one and could be worked out if given proper thought.         
	He said that the Indian Premier League (IPL) was a good idea but the credit for launching this sort of tournament should be given to the Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	I think the Indian board started working on the IPL after the ICL. I know this much these events mean good money for players and will entertain the crowds but they are also going to damage the traditional cricket in the long run. How much only time will tell, the former left-arm pacer said.         
	The 10 successive wins over minnows Zimbabwe and Bangladesh notwithstanding, Akram felt Pakistan were quite some way behind India in the cricketing ladder.         
	Any win, any century or any wicket does matter in international cricket no matter what the opposition. So I think the team has done well to win so convincingly against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. But I think while it is good for the players morale but we are still lagging behind other teams, he stated.

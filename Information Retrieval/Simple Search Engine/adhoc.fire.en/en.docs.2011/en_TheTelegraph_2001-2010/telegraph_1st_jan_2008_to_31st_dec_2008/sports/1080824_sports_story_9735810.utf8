The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flat track   a relief
                                                                                                                                                                                             Flat track   a relief

	Colombo: After two horrendous outings in the low and slow Dambulla pitch, Indian batsmen will take a lot of heart from the batting-friendly wicket at the Premadasa Stadium here when they take on Sri Lanka in the third cricket one-dayer on Sunday.         
	Although India made heavy weather of the second ODI before scraping through by three wickets, the tourists will once again be banking on their batting prowess to seize the lead in the five-match series.         
	The pitch at the Premadasa Stadium is expected to be full of runs in the initial overs and India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni would heave a sigh of relief as his in-form opener Gautam Gambhir has recovered fully from a stiff neck and is expected to open with Virat Kohli, who displayed a gutsy performance in the last match.         
	Moreover, Indian batsmen can also take some consolation from the fact that only one batsman  Mahela Jayawardene  from either side has managed to cross the half-century mark in the first two ODIs.         
	Another heartening news for India is that Subramaniam Badrinath has displayed ample maturity. If not for Badrinaths responsible and patient unbeaten 27, India could have tasted their second defeat in the series. However, what remains a concern for Dhoni is his deputy Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharmas inconsistent form.         
	Though Yuvraj showed signs of regaining his explosive form, hammering the Lankan XI bowlers to score a blistering 172 in the lone practice match, he could only manage 43 runs in the first two ODIs.         
	Unlike the batsmen, it was heartening to see the performances of Indian seamers. Zaheer Khan and Munaf Patel have been on song and are being ably supported by Praveen Kumar.         
	However, the Harbhajan Singh-led spin department is yet to prove their mettle in the series so far, compared to the deadly Lankan spin duo of Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralidharan. Although Sri Lanka looked a much better side in the entire series starting from the Tests, skipper Jayawardene has a thing or two to worry about, especially the form of his top order.         
	The toss will play a crucial role in the match as both captains, Dhoni and Jayawardene, won their matches batting second. It will be interesting to see what they do if they win the toss.         
	Teams:         
	India (from): MS Dhoni, Subramaniam Badrinath, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha, Praveen Kumar, Munaf Patel, Zaheer Khan, RP Singh and Parthiv Patel.

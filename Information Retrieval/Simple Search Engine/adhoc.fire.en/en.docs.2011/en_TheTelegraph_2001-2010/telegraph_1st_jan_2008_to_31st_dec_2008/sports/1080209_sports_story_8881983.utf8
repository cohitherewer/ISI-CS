The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CA, Aussie players on collision course
                                                  CA, Aussie players on collision course
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ricky Ponting                           
	Calcutta: Australian cricketers are on a collision course with Cricket Australia (CA) over playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the Australian media said Friday. The CA wants its global sponsors protected when the players take part in the IPL.         
	BCCI vice-president and IPL commissioner and chairman Lalit Modi has made it clear that team sponsors will not get any protection. No team sponsors will get protection from IPL. No, no and no, Modi said Friday. We dont have any row. Its between them (Australian players and Cricket Australia).         
	Modi also confirmed that Adam Gilchrist would take part in IPL. He has already got a no objection certificate from the Australian board, he said.         
	According to a report in The Sydney Morning Herald, television coverage of the IPL is at the heart of a disagreement between the Australian and Indian cricket boards over player contracts, with Indias threat of boycotting Australias stars still standing.         
	With the IPL set to be beamed to a global television audience, CA strongly opposes any of its players advertising with companies in competition with its sponsors  but the BCCI refuses to guarantee such protection.         
	Modi compared the situation to Australians playing English County cricket, where global protection does not apply, but CA views the situation differently, because IPL games are expected to be televised in Australia. This issue will be debated by both boards over the next two weeks, the report said.         
	Ricky Ponting has said he expected the Australian Cricketers Association to fight the CA on the issue if the contracts he and his teammates have been offered came under threat. If they tried to do that, Im sure the players association would have something to say, Ponting said.         
	Australian players, meanwhile, will not be freed to play for their states or fulfil other duties that clash with the IPL, according to The Australian.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tottenham, City suffer defeat 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tottenham, City suffer defeat 
                      
	Portsmouth: Portsmouth strikers Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch inflicted a 2-0 loss on Tottenham Sunday to deepen the turmoil at their former side, while newly enriched Manchester City were upset 2-1 at Wigan with both beaten sides unhappy with penalty decisions.         
	Defoe scored from the penalty spot in the 34th minute for his 13th goal in 18 games since being sold by Tottenham.         
	The victory was sealed in the 66th by Crouch, who was let go by Spurs in 2000 without being given a competitive start.         
	But Tottenham left Fratton Park with a sense of injustice after referee Mike Dean refused to award a penalty when Lassana Diarra blocked Aaron Lennons cross with his hand in the 54th  despite Jermaine Jenas being penalised for the same offence in the first half.         
	City felt similarly aggrieved at Wigan.         
	City, who trounced Portsmouth 6-0 last weekend, were fuming at a contentious penalty decision that let Amr Zaki score the winner for Wigan. There appeared to have been minimal contact when referee Steve Bennett ruled that Javier Garrido brought down Wilson Palacios in the 34th.         
	City captain Richard Dunne then thought he should have been awarded a spot kick when clipped by Emile Heskey before the break.         
	Antonio Valencia put Wigan ahead in the 16th, but Vincent Kompany levelled from close range five minutes later.         
	City struggled to break down Wigan despite British record signing Robinho and Shaun Wright-Phillips returning to the side after being rested in the loss at Brighton. (AP)         
	Three minutes after Zaki struck over from a similar position, Valencia let fly with a spectacular swerving strike from 30 yards which floated into Joe Harts top right corner.         
	Robinho was jolted into action, shooting wide before Kompany restored parity in the 21st by steering Elanos free kick home from six yards.         
	But Mark Hughess team could find no way back after conceding the penalty and being denied one of their own.           (AP)

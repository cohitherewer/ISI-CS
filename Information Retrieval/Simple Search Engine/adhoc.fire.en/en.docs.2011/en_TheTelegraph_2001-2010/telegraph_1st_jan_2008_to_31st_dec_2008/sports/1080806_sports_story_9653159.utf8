                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kulasekara set to be replaced
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: The Sri Lankans are set to effect one change in their opening attack, as theyre desperate to snare Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir early.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, its unlikely that Nuwan Kulasekara will keep his place. Instead, Thushara Mirando is favoured to make the XI in the series-deciding third Test at the P. Sara Stadium.         
	The hosts squad will be chosen on Wednesday, two days before the face-off.         
	Meanwhile, Dinesh Karthik is under pressure after indifferent performances. However, captain Anil Kumble could give him one more chance.         
	In that case Parthiv Patels wait for a comeback is going to become longer.

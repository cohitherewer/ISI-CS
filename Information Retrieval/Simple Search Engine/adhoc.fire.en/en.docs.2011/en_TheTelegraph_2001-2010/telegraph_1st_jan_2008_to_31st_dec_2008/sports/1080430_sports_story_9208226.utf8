The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Benitez queries refs curious record

	Liverpool: Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez isnt worried about overcoming a dismal record at Chelsea. Hes more concerned about the referee.         
	With the Champions League semi-final tied at 1-1 after the first leg, the Reds must score at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday for the first time in eight matches to reach a third final in four years.         
	Benitez said its not just his players who must cope with the Stamford Bridge crowd, pointing to referee Roberto Rossettis curious record in Europe this year. Rossetti has officiated six Champions League matches this season, only one of which has been won by the away team  a 2-1 victory by Chelsea at Valencia in the group stage.         
	I dont know whether you have seen the record of this one, but its good, Benitez said Tuesday. The last six games in Europe, five the local team has won and one the away team, when it was Valencia against Chelsea. Its very curious.         
	The referee has experience and hes not a bad referee, so if he knows he must be strong he will be OK.         
	Benitez urged the Italian referee to keep a careful eye on Chelsea striker Didier Drogba, whom he accused of feigning fouls.         
	He is very, very strong and he falls down  he slips, Benitez said. Everybody can see this every game, it is very clear.         
	We dont have any problem with Stamford Bridge, Benitez said.         
	The difference isnt just the stadium, its the players on the pitch  they are really good, they havent lost for 100 games or something like this (in the Premier League) and that means they are very strong at home. But we will try to score our goal. We dont need to win, just to draw 2-2 will be enough.         
	Liverpool ousted Chelsea in the semi-finals on the way to their 2005 Champions League triumph, and again last year  before losing to AC Milan in the final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo, Messi up for award
                                                                                                                                                                                                         Ronaldo, Messi up for award
                    Cristiano Ronaldo                
	Paris: Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo and FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi are the frontrunners to win this years Golden Ball, awarded by a French Football magazine to Europes top player.         
	Ronaldo finished runner-up to AC Milan midfielder Kaka last year, while Messi was third.         
	Kaka was again among the 30 nominees released on Tuesday by the magazine, but does not believe he will win this time round.         
	I am realistic. This one wont be for me. Its a shame, but its logical, Kaka said. AC Milan did not have a good season.         
	Kaka is tipping Uniteds winger to take the top prize.         
	My favourite is Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka said. He won two major titles with Manchester, and he scored a lot of goals.         
	The 23-year-old Portugal winger scored 42 goals in all competitions to help United win the Premier League title and the Champions League.         
	The 21-year-old Messi was also in sparkling form for Barcelona, scoring several breathtaking goals for the club, and also helping Argentina defeat Nigeria 1-0 to win the Olympic gold in Beijing in August.         
	Liverpool striker Fernando Torres is also among the nominees after helping Spain win the European Championship in June, grabbing the lone goal in the final against Germany.         
	Torres also scored 24 league goals in his debut season with the Reds.                 (AP)

                                                                                                                                                                                           Saina in quarters, Sania out
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Beijing: Saina Nehwal upset world No. 5 Chen Wang to move into the quarter finals of the badminton singles on Monday. Saina tamed her higher-ranked opponent 21-19, 11-21, 21-11 in 52 minutes to reach the last-eight stage.         
	In the quarters, Saina will take on Maria Kristin Yulianti of Indonesia.         
	In the first game, the lead kept changing and Saina, trailing 16-19 at one stage, looked to be in trouble before she reeled out five points on the trot to leave Wang stranded.         
	In the second, both were 7-7 when Wang won 10 of the next 12 points to stretch her lead and grab the game.         
	In the decider, Saina won the first six points before Wang made a comeback of sorts, though she was still trailing 4-7. Saina won the next five points in a row to clinch the match.         
	After the win, Saina said that she was merely taking it stage by stage, without thinking of a medal.         
	Shoji Sato of Japan, however, sent Anup Sridhar packing 21-13, 21-17 in just 37 minutes. Sato raced to 6-0 in the first set and wrapped up the game winning next five points.         
	In tennis, Sania Mirza left the court in tears after her singles campaign ended in just 46 minutes with a wrist injury forcing her to retire in the first round at the Olympic Green Tennis Center. Sania was trailing 1-6, 1-2 against Czech Iveta Benesova when she decided to concede the match. The injury also casts a cloud of doubt over her availability for Tuesdays doubles first round match.         
	Boxer A.L. Lakra lost 5-9 to Bahodirjon Sultonov of Uzbekistan in the opening round of the featherweight category.         
	In swimming, Rehan Poncha finished overall 40th among 44 in the 200m butterfly heats. Ponchas timing of 2:01.89 was 8.19 seconds behind Michael Phelps.

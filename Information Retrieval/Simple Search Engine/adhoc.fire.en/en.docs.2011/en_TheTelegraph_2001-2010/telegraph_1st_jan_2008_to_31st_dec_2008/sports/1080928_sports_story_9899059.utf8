                                                                                                                                                                                             Disappointed, but no regrets: Vengsarkar
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Dilip Vengsarkar                           
	Mumbai: Dilip Vengsarkar appeared quite relaxed on Saturday, the day Krishnamachari Srikkanth took over as chief selector.         
	Contacted by The Telegraph, Vengsarkar said: Im happy that Team Indias rankings improved during the two years I was the selection committee chairman... My committee took some good decisions and I have no regrets... Im sure the new committee will also do a good job...         
	Asked if he was disappointed at having to leave because of a technicality, Vengsarkar replied: Well, the Board added a clause saying no office-bearer anywhere could become a selector... I had to leave because Im a vice-president of the Mumbai Cricket Association... Yes, that way, Im disappointed...         
	Vengsarkar grinned when it was pointed out that most feel the office-bearers clause got introduced to ease him out. Look, the Board officials have their point, more so as the selectors will now be paid... I really wouldnt like to say anything more...         
	For the record, quite a few of the decisions taken by Vengsarkar and Co. centered around Sourav Ganguly. From recalling him in late 2006 to dropping him from the ODIs in January 2008 and, then, ignoring him for the Irani Trophy which ended on Saturday.

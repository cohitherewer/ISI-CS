The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cluj aspire to give Chelsea the blues
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cluj aspire to give Chelsea the blues

	London: After upsetting AS Roma, Romanias CFR Cluj are now targeting another European powerhouse in the Champions League  English leaders Chelsea.         
	The team from Transylvania is tied on points with the Blues at the top of their Champions League group. After winning 2-1 in Romes Olympic Stadium two weeks ago, the Cluj players are not scared of Luiz Felipe Scolaris powerful Chelsea line-up.         
	I want to defeat Chelsea and show I am a good coach, said Cluj coach Maurizio Trombetta, an Italian who has only been in charge of the team for a month.         
	Runners-up last season after losing a penalty shootout in the final against Manchester United, Chelsea began their new challenge with a routine 4-0 victory over Bordeaux at Stamford Bridge. A victory at Cluj on Wednesday will put the Blues well on their way to the knockout stage, although Scolari is wary of the Romanian team.         
	They are more confident than before. They have good players, the Brazilian said. We respect Cluj. We respect their performance.         
	Roma hope to rebound from their loss at home while Laurent Blancs Bordeaux, already eight points behind Lyon in the French league title race, will be at least three adrift of their three Group A rivals if they lose at home.         
	Roma and Chelsea are among nine of the 16 clubs in action on Wednesday, which have either won European footballs most prestigious title or been runners-up.         
	Five-time winners Liverpool host PSV Eindhoven, who captured the title 20 years ago when it was known as the European Cup. The other Group D game involved two more runners-up, Atletico Madrid and Marseille.         
	Liverpool, who won 2-1 at Marseille, have had a strong start to the season and are level on points with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League.         
	We have confidence and you can see the team is playing well and has a good balance, manager Rafa Benitez said. We are strong in defence and we know we can create scoring opportunities. So that is very important. When we are playing well we know we can beat anyone.         
	PSV coach Huub Stevens doesnt think much of his teams chances at Anfield, having lost 0-3 at home to Atletico two weeks ago.         
	It was really disappointing to start the campaign with such a heavy home defeat, Stevens said.         
	We know we just have to learn from what happened, because going to Liverpool will be even more difficult. But we have only played one match, there are still five to go. So we can turn this round.         
	Inter Milan, on a run of three Serie A titles in a row, havent won the European title since 1965. They are coached by Jose Mourinho, who won it four years ago with FC Porto but then failed to guide Chelsea to the title.         
	On the top of Group B, Inter host Werder Bremen on Wednesday after a victory at Panathinaikos. The Greek club go to Cyprus to face Anorthosis Famagusta.         
	Inter lost 0-1 to neighbours AC Milan in Serie A on Sunday, but captain Javier Zanetti says the players are already over that loss.         
	The loss to Milan is behind us, now our legs and minds are concentrated on the Champions League, the Argentina star said.         
	Bremen have scored 10 goals in their last two games, 5-2 against Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich and a 5-4 victory over Hoffenheim. The first Cypriot team to make it this far, Anorthosis captured a point from a 0-0 draw with Bremen.         
	FC Barcelona, two-time winner and three-time runners up, have recovered from a slow start to the season and go to Ukraine to face Shakhtar Donetsk. Both teams share the lead at the top of Group C.           (AP)

                  Roger Federer moved into last four                     
	Monte Carlo: World No. 1 Roger Federer came from a set down to outclass Argentine sixth seed David Nalbandian 5-7, 6-2, 6-2 and book his place in the Monte Carlo Masters last four on Friday.         
	In a tense encounter, Federer converted all his five break chances to improve his personal record against Nalbandian to 9-8 after losing their two previous matches in the Madrid and Paris Masters last year.         
	Federer failed to create a single break chance in a balanced first set and Nalbandian stole his serve in the 11th game.         
	The Argentine wrapped the opener after 52 minutes when a sloppy Federer sent a backhand passing shot wide.         
	The world No. 1 regained composure and after a trade of breaks, won four games in a row with some impressive shots, including a stunning drop shot on the run.         
	He broke again in the sixth game of the decider with a service return into Nalbandians feet and sealed the win after two hours and seven minutes on the Argentines serve with a forehand crosscourt winner.         
	Federer, who won the Estoril Open last weekend, has now won the eight matches he has played on clay this season.         
	Earlier, Nikolay Davydenko overcame a poor serving performance to beat fellow Russian Igor Andreev 6-3, 4-6, 7-5.         
	Davydenko, seeded fourth, will meet the winner of the all-Spanish clash between Masters Cup finalist David Ferrer and three-time defending champion Rafael Nadal.         
	Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi and partner Mark Knowles of Bahamas stormed into the semi-finals of the mens doubles.         
	The fourth seeded pair defeated fifth seeds Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Julian Knowles of Austria 6-2, 6-3 in the quarter final.           (AGENCIES)

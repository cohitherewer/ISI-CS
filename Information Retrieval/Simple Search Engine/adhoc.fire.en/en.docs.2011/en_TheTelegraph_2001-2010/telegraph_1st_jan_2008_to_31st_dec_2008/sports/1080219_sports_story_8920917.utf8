The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Win takes Anand to 2nd spot
                                                   Win takes Anand to 2nd spot
                      
	Morelia: World champion Viswanathan Anand bounced back with an emphatic victory over Norwegian Magnus Carlsen in the third round of the Morelia-Linares chess tournament here.         
	The victory kept Anands score with black at 100 per cent. It also catapulted the Indian ace to sole second spot with two points out of a possible three.         
	Former champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria came up with an impressive show to down overnight joint leader Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine. The Bulgarian emerged as the sole leader with 2.5 points. Ivanchuk, Aronian and Peter Leko of Hungary, with 1.5 points each, are on joint third.         
	Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan, Shirov and Carlsen are placed sixth with a point each in this category-21 event between eight players.         
	Anand outclassed Carlsen in all departments of the game. The Indian ace played in copybook fashion in the Semi Slav Defence and the Moscow Variation failed to yield anything worthwhile for Carlsen. Carlsen resigned after 59 moves. (PTI)

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Let anger remain within, advises Shoaib Akhtar
  -   Speedster picks Ishant as most promising young quick                 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                                      Shoaib Akhtar    
	Calcutta: Driven by speed, Shoaib Akhtar has made an impact in most matches that hes played. The 32-year-old, who is wearing the Kolkata Knight Riders colours in the Indian Premier League, recently spoke to The Telegraph and (among other things) picked his favourite quicks.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Role model         
	Imran Khan I first met him, I think, at a camp in 1992 The camp was at the Rawalpindi Stadium.         
	Qualities that are a must for fast bowlers         
	Passion Drive The willingness to keep running in ball after ball Above all, a good bowling brain In other words, the bowler has to think before the batsman begins to do so I learnt this by watching Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis         
	His five all-time favourite quicks (in no particular order):         
	IMRAN KHAN: As a person, deadly honest and very helpful A true Pakistani As a bowler, well, what do I say? The effort he put in to become a great fast bowler was really amazing If you take Imran out of Pakistan cricket, theres nothing left Thats the kind of impact Imran has had.         
	Wickets taken: 362 in Tests and 182 in ODIs.         
	MALCOLM MARSHALL: He was shrewd He was deceptive He could swing the ball conventionally, he could reverse the ball Malcolm had everything going for him In fact, Id call him the right-handed Wasim.         
	Wickets taken: 376 in Tests and 157 in ODIs.         
	WASIM AKRAM: Frankly, Ive got no words to describe him His talent, his record It goes beyond words I dont think cricket will ever get to see somebody as talented.         
	Wickets taken: 414 in Tests and 502 in ODIs.         
	WAQAR YOUNIS: A truly fascinating great with a terrific personality Hed terrorise batsmen and had everything in his armoury, including a lethal bouncer. A legend.         
	Wickets taken: 373 in Tests and 416 in ODIs.         
	GLENN McGRATH: Could bowl in all conditions, the sign of an absolute great He was aggressive in his own way and you only need to look at his record to see how he bowled his heart out for Australia.         
	Wickets taken: 563 in Tests and 381 in ODIs.         
	His own approach         
	(Laughs) Usually, Im very hyper Dont like sitting down and not doing anything Im the very positive type and nothing affects me that easily I can motivate myself in the bad times too.         
	The most promising young quick         
	(Knight Riders teammate) Ishant Sharma Hes a great talent and has a good bowling brain Its being smart in tight situations which separates the good fast bowlers from those whore just ordinary I see him getting quicker Of course, he needs to strengthen his muscles He definitely needs to work on his physique Its around the age of 23 that quicks really come of age Ishant is 19 and needs to train well. As important, needs to be handled well Fast bowlers are match-winners and should be handled with care. The management aspect is critical         
	Finally, his advice for young quicks         
	Youve got to have the will to excel Youve got to be clear about what you wish to become Look to the next ten years and set targets Work hard and dont allow anything to become an obstacle Nothing, indeed, should stop you and if youre wanting to go far then youve got to be ready to face big challenges I say that because there could be people who may want to mess with you If youre angry about something, let the anger remain within and become positive energy That, I believe, is bound to help you as a person and as a cricketer The system, as far as Im concerned, must only push those whore talented. Theres no point encouraging somebody who just isnt good enough.

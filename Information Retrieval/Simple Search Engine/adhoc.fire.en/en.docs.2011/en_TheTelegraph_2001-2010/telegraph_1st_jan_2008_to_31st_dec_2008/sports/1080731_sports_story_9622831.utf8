The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahela wants to wrap it up
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mahela wants to wrap it up
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Galle: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said they would retain the winning combination in the second cricket Test beginning on Thursday and are planning to wrap up the three-match series here.         
	The following are the excerpts:         
	Q. On whether the conditions are different from Colombo         
	A. Not much difference. The wicket probably will be a little bit similar. The only thing is that there would be quite a strong breeze coming through the sea. Thats about it. I cant see the wicket and the conditions being that much different from Colombo.         
	If the ball will move around         
	When we played England, it did a bit but there had been lot of rain and the wicket had a bit of moisture in it. But this wicket looks pretty dry like the one we played at the SSC. Probably there will be a bit of bounce but nothing significant.         
	If there are any thoughts of resting a senior player         
	No thoughts of resting a senior player. We are pretty confident with the win we had the other day. We will definitely be going in the same frame of mind which we had going into the first match of the series  that is to win. We are planning to wrap it up, thats the plan definitely. We probably will play the same team. We have spoken to the selectors this morning and they are quite happy to have the same team, given the conditions are not that different.         
	If the toss is going to be important         
	I dont think the toss will make a huge difference. The wicket would probably have a bit of turn on the fourth and fifth days of the game but it depends on the weather as well. If you have the game being affected by the rain, there wont be that much time for the wicket to deteriorate.         
	On playing at Galle         
	This has been one of our very famous grounds. Its good to have it back in this condition. England was the first Test we played here after about four years, after the tsunami. We were very pleased to come back here and play.         
	Would the Indians be able to solve the spin mystery?         
	Definitely asked them some questions and they didnt have the answers. We will have to find out if they have the answers for that yet. If they have answers, we will start asking different questions!         
	On the expectations from Mendis         
	To go out there and enjoy himself. Thats what he did in the last game. He had a very big smile when he took the ball. Just want him to continue to do that. Its important that we keep him the way he is. He is a guy who likes to bowl, he is a guy who likes to challenge himself.

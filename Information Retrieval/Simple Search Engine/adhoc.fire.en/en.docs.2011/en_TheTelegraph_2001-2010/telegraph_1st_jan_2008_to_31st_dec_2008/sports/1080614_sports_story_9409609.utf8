            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Srinagar: At last, there is good news for Subhas Bhowmick and Sukhwinder Singh.         
	According to sources, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has decided to allow some of the coaches without the AFC A Licence to work with the I-League clubs in India.         
	The AFC, sources said, are likely to issue a special certificate to coaches who have already coached the national team or have spent more than five years with an I-League team. The facility, however, wont be extended beyond 2011. The coaches, willing to avail of this facility, will have to apply to AFC with all relevant documents.         
	Earlier, on AFCs advice, All India Football Federation (AIFF) issued a guideline saying that no coach without an AFC A licence would be able to take up coaching assignments with the I-League clubs.         
	The move was a big blow for Bhowmick, Sukhwinder and Bimal Ghosh as they do not possess any AFC coaching licence.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Supreme Court on Wednesday took up for hearing the Jharkhand State Cricket Association case after the BCCI had filed a three-member committee report a week ago.         
	The committee had been constituted in terms of the Supreme Court order dated August 31, 2007.         
	BCCI counsel Ravi Shankar Prasad, former Union minister, apprised the Court that the three-member committee comprising Chirayu Amin, M.P. Pandove and Sanjay Jagdale, heard in details the submissions of all the contestants.         
	The BCCI committee came to the conclusion that the original Bihar Cricket Association with its headquarters in Jamshedpur, now called the Jharkhand State Cricket Association, is the only Full Member of the Board from the entire region.         
	The committee rejected the claims of the Patna-based Bihar Cricket Association and the Cricket Association of Jharkhand headed by B. Muthuraman, MD of Tata Steel.         
	The committee reached a conclusion after tracing the evolution of the original association since its creation in 1935.

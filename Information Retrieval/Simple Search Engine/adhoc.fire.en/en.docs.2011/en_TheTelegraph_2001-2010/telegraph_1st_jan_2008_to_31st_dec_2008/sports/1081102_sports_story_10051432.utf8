  - Harbhajan would have added value, says kirsten       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar at the Kotla on Saturday. (AP)                                 
	New Delhi: Indian coach Gary Kirsten admitted on Saturday that poor fielding cost India dear on the fourth day of the third Test match.         
	The fielding errors were crucial. Ishant dropped Clarke when he was yet to add to his overnight score, he said.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q: What went wrong today?         
	A: It wasnt a great day for us. The fielding was poor and it helped Australia to score more that 500 runs. We simply didnt create many opportunities today (Saturday). The wicket was good and on such tracks you have to create opportunities. It was not an easy pitch to get wickets.         
	Do you think fielding let you down?         
	Yes. The fielding errors were crucial. Ishant dropped Clarke when he was yet to add to his overnight score.         
	You missed too many catches         
	Well, Australia had crossed the 500-run mark when the other catches were dropped. So they wouldnt have made much of a difference. But the first catch could have had a bearing on the game.         
	Did you hope to win?         
	We arrived in the morning thinking we had a chance of getting ourselves to a winning position. But instead we let the Aussies capitalise on our mistakes.         
	You didnt bowl well too         
	I dont think we bowled well enough to create enough opportunities.         
	Did you lack variety?         
	I think we had enough variety in our bowling with Viru (Virender Sehwag) doing so well. But it was not easy to get wickets on this pitch and we missed whatever opportunity came our way.         
	Did you miss Harbhajan Singh?         
	Harbhajan would have added value to the team, he is a tremendous bowler. But I think we have enough variety and options in the spin department for the Test. You just have to create the opportunities.         
	What are your plans for the last day?         
	We are 79 ahead now and tomorrow we will bat for another session or two and let us see what happens. We can set a decent target for them. But yes, time is running out. The wicket is still good to bat on.         
	Was it necessary to send the nightwatchman?         
	All the cricket that I have played or been a part of, we have always asked the No.3 or 4 batsman if he needs a nightwatchman. It was a request to send a nightwatchman.         
	What do you feel about Anil Kumbles bowling?         
	Anil was fantastic. Its in his nature which makes him an incredible asset to the team, and Im pleased that he got a few wickets. He also took a great catch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time for me to slow down: Jeev
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Time for me to slow down: Jeev
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jeev Milkha                           
	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh is seriously thinking about cutting down on the number of tournaments he would play next season.         
	It is time I slowed down, said the ace golfer at the end of the Indian Open at the Delhi Golf Club on Sunday. I am getting too many injuries. I am sure I wont be able to play so many tournaments next season.         
	I am constantly on painkillers, said Jeev. It is not the right approach. It cant go on like that.         
	Jeev said he was on the verge of pulling out of the tournament as he had a sprained neck. My ankle was all right but my neck was hurting. I thought about pulling out but finally managed to come out after my neck was taped by my physio, Jeev said.         
	Without the injury I could have done better, Jeev admitted. Deep down I know I tried by best but it was not enough to win the tournament. But I am still happy that I could finish fourth.         
	Asked about Liangs performance, Jeev said: It was a fantastic show. This win is going to help revive the sport in China. When I won the Volvo Open in 2006, golf received a boost in India.         
	Jeev believes that golf has a tremendous future in India but it will have to go a long way before catching up with cricket. Cricket is the most popular sport in India. But golf, too, in making good progress.

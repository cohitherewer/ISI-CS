The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vishy may again be seen as a national selector
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vishy may again be seen as a national selector
    - Talk that Vengsarkar could continue on committee           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gundappa Viswanath                                 
	Calcutta: Theres a good chance that former India captain Gundappa Viswanath will be on the next senior selection committee.         
	Vishy is, of course, a former chief selector (or chairman) and had been in the chair when Sachin Tendulkar got the captaincy for the first time, in 1996.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, somebody who has outgoing Board president Sharad Pawars ear is one of those lobbying hard. Vishy, incidentally, is Sunil Gavaskars brother-in-law.         
	Besides, Vishys home state, Karnataka, is exploring ways and means to get him on that committee.         
	Unlike in the past, the zones wont get their men elected at the Boards AGM. Instead, the Board president will have the biggest say in nominating the five selectors, one from each zone, who will now be paid.         
	The AGM is on September 27-28.         
	Ive spoken to some in the Board, but nobody is quite sure whats the way forward... However, Tamil Nadu, Hyderabad and we have an arrangement. Going by that, its our turn... Even if theres a new structure, I hope that will be followed, the Karnataka secretary, Brijesh Patel, said on Wednesday.         
	A former chief selector himself, Patel added from Bangalore: Vishys our first choice, but we have a second name ready as well  (former India left-arm spinner) Raghuram Bhat.         
	A senior Board official, though, raised doubts whether Vishy would be eligible. There have been amendments to the constitution... I dont think anybody who has already been a selector for four years can again become one.         
	Patel had a counter: If that is so, then why wasnt Sanjay Jagdale (Central) removed? This, after all, is his second innings... Ill check, but I dont see a problem over Vishy...         
	Theres also talk that the current chief selector, Dilip Vengsarkar (West), could be retained. But, then, he will have to quit as a Mumbai vice-president unless the guidelines decided upon by the Boards working committee get rejected at the AGM.         
	Indeed, today, theres no guarantee that the guidelines (including the bar on selectors being office-bearers either in the Board or in any affiliated unit) will actually be endorsed at the AGM.         
	The powers-that-be will, however, face a pretty ticklish situation if both Vishy and Vengsarkar are among the five selectors.         
	Specifically, should Vengsarkar (also a former India captain) then continue as chief selector?         
	Vishy made his debut well before Vengsarkar, 1969 vis--vis 1976, but the latter has many more India appearances. The Mumbaikars ahead, 116 to 91, even if Tests alone get taken into account.         
	Significantly, Vengsarkar wont get affected if the four years bit is enforced as hes been a selector from 2006-07 only.         
	Where the other zones are concerned, some of the names doing the rounds are Chetan Chauhan (North), Narendra Hirwani (Central) and Snehashish Ganguly (East).         
	The Board, meanwhile, is compiling data, which could come in handy when Pawar and Co. discuss the composition of the next senior selection committee.         
	Footnote: Its more or less confirmed that treasurer N.Srinivasan will be the next secretary, with current joint-secretary Mohinder Pandove succeeding him. Its not clear who will succeed Pandove.

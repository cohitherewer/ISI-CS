                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Togo win maiden Olympic medal
                      
	Beijing: Michael Phelps carved his name among the Olympic greats on Tuesday, smashing another world record in the pool to join Mark Spitz and Carl Lewis in an elite group on a record nine career golds.         
	An imperious victory in the 200 metres freestyle also gave the 23-year-old American his third gold in Beijing as he seeks to overtake Spitzs other record, seven golds at a single Games.         
	Germany wiped out bitter memories of disqualification in Athens to pick up team and individual golds in the equestrian three-day event, and got two more golds to get their medal quest off the mark in style.         
	Togo won their first Olympic medal, in kayaking, and North Korea won a rare gold, but the record books will remember Phelps on Tuesday for another powerful performance at the Water Cube.         
	Phelps could overtake compatriots Lewis and Spitz, Flying Finn runner Paavo Nurmi and Soviet gymnast Larysa Latynina, all on nine golds, when he swims two more finals on Wednesday.         
	Phelps led an American fightback against Chinese dominance of the medal table on day four, the US team winning three out of four golds on offer at the pool.         
	They picked up another when a Texan hunter, Walton Eller, beat an Italian policeman in the mens double trap shooting.         
	China struck back with gold in the mens team gymnastics, an elegant victory in the womens 10m synchronised platform diving, a mens fencing gold and another weightlifting title. By the close of day four, China led the Americans by 13 golds to seven, but the US team were expected to close the gap when track and field gets under way on Friday.         
	Gold medallists in Sydney, the Chinese failed to win a medal in Athens. This time they stormed to victory in front of an ecstatic crowd, led by double world all-round champion Yang Wei.         
	Back in the sporting arena, Germanys medal drive burst into life with four golds. One came in mens kayaking and another in judo but most keenly celebrated was a double eventing triumph.         
	The teams joy followed heartbreak in Athens, where Bettina Hoy was forced to hand back her gold after she was disqualified for crossing the starting line in a warm-up lap.         
	There was unlikely glory for Togo with its first ever Olympic medal, bronze in kayaking for Benjamin Boukpeti. (REUTERS)

                                                     SSP fails to make cut
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Randhawa                           
	Noida: Indian Masters winner Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia had a disastrous outing in the $400,000 SAIL Open as he failed to make the cut at the Jaypee Greens on Thursday.         
	Nothing went right for the Calcutta-based golfer, who started his day on the 10th tee. His round of two-over 74 was stained with two double bogeys as against two birdies and he finished with a tally of 146, not enough to make the cut.         
	It was a real bad day for me, Chowrasia told The Telegraph later. I have no complaint against the longish nature of the course which doesnt always suit with my style of play. Frankly speaking, I played badly.         
	Thats life, Chowrasia smiled. I tried my best but couldnt do it. Golf is an unpredictable game. Lets hope for the best in the next tournament.         
	While the Calcutta golfer disappointed his fans, local hero Jyoti Randhawa shifted to the familiar pole position as he carded a four-under 68 to move to nine-under 135. Jointly leading the pack with Randhawa is overnight leader Tony Carolan of Australia.         
	In the third place is Wang ter-Chang of Chinese Taipei, whose five-under 67 put him at eight-under 136.         
	Randhawa had a good day in office as he shot an even par on the front nine with one birdie and one bogey but he dished out a fine show when he slammed four birdies on the back nine for a 68 after his first round 67.         
	The cut came at one-over 145 and 74 players made the weekend rounds.         
	Chowrasia was not the only prominent figure to miss the cut as Thammannoon Srirot (Thailand ), Harmeet Kahlon, Rahil Gangjee (73-74), Amandeep Johl (72-78) and Gaurav Ghei ((72-79) also bowed out.

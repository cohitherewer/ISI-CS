The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Melbourne to host twilight GP till 2015
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Melbourne to host twilight GP till 2015
                      
	Melbourne: Australia has secured the rights to host the Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne until 2015, with a new evening start to reach a greater television audience overseas, officials said on Friday.         
	The race at Melbournes Albert Park will start 90 minutes later at 5:00 pm (0600 GMT) from next year after a new contract was signed with Formula One bosses overnight, Victorian premier John Brumby said.         
	Next years later start time will mean even greater television audiences in the United Kingdom, Asian and European markets, which means more exposure for brand Melbourne than ever before, Brumby said.         
	The new timing is an apparent compromise following pressure from F1 chiefs for Australia to hold the race at night to suit European TV audiences. The event had been in danger of being handed to Russia, India or Korea.         
	The Victorian state government had said it would do whatever is fair and reasonable to keep the event after its current contract expires in 2010, but had repeatedly refused to introduce a night race.         
	 Meanwhile, the British Formula One Grand Prix will switch to Donington Park from Silverstone in 2010, the governing International Automobile Federation (FIA) said on Friday.

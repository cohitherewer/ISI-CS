The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | After the auction, will players be interested in Ranji Trophy: Kapil
                                                   After the auction, will players be interested in Ranji Trophy: Kapil
  - World Cup-winning captain is concerned about the direction Indian cricket is taking         A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                          
	Calcutta: The Indian Premier League (IPL) players auction became the No.1 news on Wednesday, but its Kapil Devs rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) which was first off the blocks. The talismanic Kapil, Indias only (full-fledged) World Cup-winning captain, spoke to The Telegraph from New Delhi on Thursday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Reaction to the auction         
	As a former player, Im very happy that the present-day cricketers have got so much money However, Im a little uncomfortable with this whole business of auctioning players To my mind, they are priceless. Can somebody, for example, put a price on a Sachin Tendulkar? You cant put them out like vegetables in a market Even if an auction was to have been done, nothing shouldve been made public. You can differ, but thats my view. (Adds laughing) Perhaps, Im from the old school.         
	On his reasons for wanting things to be hush-hush         
	Good reasons Chiefly so that a Zaheer Khan doesnt feel he deserved more than X or Y or that his base price shouldve been higher Many examples can be cited Some of the young batsmen have got phenomenal sums, but does that mean their contribution has been more than those whove consistently delivered over a number of years? Im not grudging anybody anything, but its a question which definitely needs to be asked.         
	Surprised at the millions spent at the auction         
	No, not at all I think too little was spent, probably because of a behind-the-scenes understanding on a cap (After a pause) If the models being used in soccer or basketball or baseball overseas have been copied, then the players should actually be getting say 20 per cent of the revenue If its a business, then the players are the business and they must receive a share of the revenue instead of a price being put against their name That way, then, a Sachin would probably be getting ten times more than what hes assured of (around Rs 4.5 crore).         
	The IPL creating a much bigger buzz than the ICL         
	The media, I think, is getting carried away Much has been made of the business model of the IPL, but why was it not used to lift the Ranji Trophy and the Duleep Trophy and the Challenger Trophy? The top players from overseas shouldve been allowed to play After the auction, will players still be interested in the Ranji Trophy? Or, for that matter, the Challenger Trophy? Theyll look to make headlines in Twenty20 tournaments Is it actually so that the players whove been reluctant to play in tournaments like the limited overs Challenger Trophy are that enthusiastic now about Twenty20 cricket? Well, its all about money then Dont get me wrong, Im not critical of money coming the players way... They dont have to beg today, but Im concerned about what will happen to the Ranji Trophy after three years How are we going to select players for Test cricket? Where exactly will they come from? Kahan se?         
	On the concept of city teams         
	The ICL is also city-driven, but I fear that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will soon be run by the owners of the eight IPL teams The IPL is a business for them and, to keep it healthy, they could go to any length. Mark my words.         
	The business model         
	Its simple: You look at what youre spending and the returns you expect. Main bhi thoda business karta hoon, so I know a few things.         
	Whether the IPL will now finish his ICL         
	Why? If theres one Rupee in the market, at least some portion of that will come to the ICL As for the players, when somebody is ready (in terms of skills and in the mind) to play for the country, nobody can stop him from doing so Had a (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni come on board, could he have been barred from representing India? Kaun rokta?         
	His dream Twenty20 XI         
	Havent thought of it Today, Im concerned at the direction Indian cricket is taking Concerned about who will represent India after three years or so.         
	Finally, on the BCCI stopping the pensions of all those associated with the ICL         
	Ive gone to court because of the principle involved, not the amount It could be about one Rupee, thats not the issue The matter is sub judice and, so, I wouldnt like to say anything more.

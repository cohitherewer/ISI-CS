The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Moolah factor is at play in India

	A tour of India is traditionally considered one of the toughest assignments in the global calendar. Yet I believe it would be a mistake for England to go out there next month with the aim of scrapping their way to a draw. This Indian team is in a flux. They can be beaten if you go hard at them. And this is as good a time as any to try.         
	Indias new chairman of selectors, Kris Srikkanth, faces a huge quandary. The great Indian batsmen are approaching the end of their careers. Some of them are desperate to prolong their international lifespans, not just because they love the game but probably because of the endorsement deals available. But none of them are the force they once were.         
	Think of that period in the early part of this decade when Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Sourav Ganguly reached their peak together. Shane Warne went to India three times and averaged over 40. They just batted him out of the game.         
	Which is very different to what we saw this summer, when the Sri Lankan spinners, Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis, got on top of the Indian batsmen. That series, which Sri Lanka won 2-1, will have had a major effect on their confidence.         
	There is much debate and soul-searching in India over who should play in the series against Australia, which starts next week. It is easy to say that the time has come for youth. But is anyone sure that the youngsters are good enough to take over?         
	Tendulkar has so many miles on the clock that he picks up injuries all the time. Dravid, Ganguly and Laxman have been left out of the one-dayers for a year now. Its the natural progression of life: one-day cricket is a young mans game. But if you look at the replacements, theyre not that special.         
	Gautam Gambhir and Wasim Jaffer are probably the best of the next generation. Yuvraj Singh has been found wanting in Test cricket. One possible scenario is that the experienced players are given a final chance in this series, only to be cast into outer darkness if they fail. And that could play into Englands hands.         
	Kevin Pietersen must tell his quick bowlers to go after Virender Sehwag, who so often gets India off to a flier. Sehwag scores fast and lifts the whole spirit of the team when he is firing. England have to get up his nose. Dont try to bounce him out, because Indian pitches give batsmen more time to play the hook shot, but get the ball into his ribs. Get him tucked up and in a tangle. The key is to deny him the room to play shots.         
	The pace of Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison will be Englands biggest weapon, because the senior batsmen should all be vulnerable early on to quality fast bowling. The pitches wont give you much, so you have to be precise and accurate. But the way England have been playing since Pietersen became captain, theyve got to think positive and believe that they can bowl India out.         
	The new ball is the key for Pietersen. England must make early inroads because their spin attack wont be able to match Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble. Those guys are match-winners on a turning surface. But if England can pull off a series win in India, it will put a real marker down for next summers Ashes.

	London: European countries begin their campaigns to reach the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa on Saturday with newly-crowned continental champions Spain and world champions Italy among those under new management.         
	Vicente del Bosque has succeeded Luis Aragones as Spains coach while Italys World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi is back in his old job following Roberto Donadonis departure after their disappointing European championship performance.         
	Other men looking to win their first competitive games in charge include Italian Fabio Capello, who leads England against Andorra and Croatia, and Bert van Marwijk, Marco Van Bastens successor as Dutch coach whose side kicks off against Macedonia next Wednesday after a friendly against Australia on Saturday.         
	Germany, beaten in the Euro 2008 final by Spain, and France, who failed to survive the group stages in June, have kept faith with Joachim Loew and Raymond Domenech respectively.         
	Europes 53 teams are chasing 13 of the 32 final berths in South Africa with the nine group winners qualifying directly along with four runners-up who come through a play-off round.         
	Spanish coach Del Bosques first competitive game is against Bosnia in Murcia on Saturday before they face Armenia in Albacete on Wednesday.         
	However, Del Bosque will be without Euro 2008 scoring hero Fernando Torres and midfielder David Silva who have both dropped out of the squad with injuries.         
	Italy begin the defence of their world title with a match they should win against Cyprus in Larnaca before facing Georgia.         
	England coach Fabio Capello should at least get a winning start against tiny Andorra in neutral Barcelona on Saturday. (REUTERS)

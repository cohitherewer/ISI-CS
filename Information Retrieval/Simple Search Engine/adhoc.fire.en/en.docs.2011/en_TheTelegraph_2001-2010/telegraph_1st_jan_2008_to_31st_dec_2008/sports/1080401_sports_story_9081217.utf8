            BIPIN SHENOY            Saptarshi Roy is about to take note of a Koneru Humpy move at Gorky Sadan on Monday. Humpy won the game. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Four players shared the lead after the end of the eighth round of the Calcutta International Open Chess tournament at Alekhine Chess Club on Monday.         
	Krishnan Sasikiran, Koneru Humpy, Sandipan Chanda and Viktor Laznicka shared the lead with 6.5 points apiece. In a crucial ninth round encounter, Sasikiran faces Sandipan while Humpy will fight it out against Laznicka on Tuesday.         
	Top seed Sasikiran scored a fluent win against the Filipino Grandmaster Nguyen Anh Dung. Sasikiran castled on the queenside in a Slav defence and a sharp battle ensued.         
	Sasikiran won a pawn on the 27th move and kept up the pressure on his opponent, after which he gained a piece. He wrapped up the game with precision thereafter in 60 moves.         
	Koneru Humpy handed down a lesson in minor piece end-game to the talented IM Saptarshi Roy who went on a exchanging spree hoping to draw the game and keep his GM norm prospects alive.         
	But Humpy, who is well versed in the nuances of end-game, played the resulting knight ending precisely to post a comfortable win.         
	Saptarshi, who meets the Iranian GM Ehsan Ghaem Maghami in the next round, requires a win to get his maiden GM norm.         
	Sandipan Chandas active play on the kingside against Ziaur Rahman in a modern defence paid rich dividends as his passed pawn and better placed pieces decided the fate of the game.         
	GM Viktor Laznicka Czech Republic outwitted GM David Alberto of Luxemburg in what was probably the most exciting game of the day. In a sharp game which arose from a Sicilian defence, Laznicka created weakness around Albertos king by pushing his h-pawn to fix his opponents pawns on that wing. Laznicka then, penetrated the back rank to threaten mate, after which Alberto resigned.         
	GM Dibyendu Barua outwitted IM V. Saravanan with the white pieces in a Sicilian defence. Saravanan sacrificed his rook for Baruas knight and launched an early attack leaving his king in the centre. Barua counter-attacked by breaking open the centre after which Saravanan king was hard pressed to find shelter in the open.         
	The chief arbiter R.C. Chatterjee said that S. Arun Prasad, P. Konguvel and Rolando Nolte of Philippines are the other IM in the run for GM norms. All of them require a win in the next round to get the norm.

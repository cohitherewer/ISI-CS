	Wellington: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori struck in the last over to reduce the West Indies to 258 for six at the close of a fascinating first day of the second Test in Napier on Friday.         
	Vettori bowled West Indies wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin with the first ball of the 91st over to undo some of the damage from a fighting 163-run partnership by the reliable Shivnarine Chanderpaul and newcomer Brendan Nash (74).         
	Chanderpaul finished on 100 not out with Jerome Taylor alongside him on one following a day of fluctuating fortunes.         
	The West Indies captain Chris Gayle won the toss and chose to bat on a sunny day with not a cloud in sight but he was left regretting that decision after steady bowling and brilliant New Zealand fielding reduced the tourists to 74 for four at lunch.         
	Gayle made his customary blistering start, smashing five boundaries in his 34 before Iain Brien produced a brilliant ball which squared the West Indies skipper up and caught the edge of his bat through to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum.         
	An aggressive Ramnaresh Sarwan looked to continue the onslaught and raced to 11 before he tried to cut off-spinner Jeetan Patel and gave a faint edge to McCullum.         
	Brien then claimed his second scalp when Xavier Marshall (6) edged a ball to second slip and Jesse Ryder dived to his right to take a superb catch.           (REUTERS)

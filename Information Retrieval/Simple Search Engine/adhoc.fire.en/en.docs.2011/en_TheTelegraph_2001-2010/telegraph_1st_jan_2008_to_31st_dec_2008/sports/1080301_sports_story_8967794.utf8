The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manoj Tiwary is much better
                                                     Manoj Tiwary is much better
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Manoj Tiwary                           
	Sydney: Young Manoj Tiwary, whod been in considerable pain due to a dental problem, had two of his teeth removed here on Friday morning.         
	Im much better now, but have been advised to take it easy for 24 hours, which is why I didnt attend nets this evening, Tiwary told The Telegraph.         
	Tiwary had been rushed from Calcutta hours before the start of the ongoing tri-series as a cover for the-then injured ODI vice-captain Yuvraj Singh.         
	Without even one session of nets, Tiwary was played in the opener (February 3), versus Australia, but couldnt make an impression. Hes been no more than a tourist since then.

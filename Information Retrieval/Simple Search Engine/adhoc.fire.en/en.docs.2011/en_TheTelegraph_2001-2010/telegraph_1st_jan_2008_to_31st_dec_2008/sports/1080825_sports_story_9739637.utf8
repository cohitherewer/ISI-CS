	Valencia: A mechanic working for the Ferrari team of world champion Kimi Raikkonen was hospitalised after being run over by the Finn during refuelling at the European Grand Prix here on Sunday.         
	Raikkonen took off while the fuel pump was still in his car. Raikkonen reversed and apparently ran over the leg of the Ferrari mechanic, who was quickly stretched off.

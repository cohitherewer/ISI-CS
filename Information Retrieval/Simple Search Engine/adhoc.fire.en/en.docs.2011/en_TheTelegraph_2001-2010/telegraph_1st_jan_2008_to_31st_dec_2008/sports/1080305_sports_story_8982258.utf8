The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds not to be charged
                                                   Symonds not to be charged
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Andrew Symonds will not be punished by the International Cricket Council for manhandling a streaker during the second final in Brisbane on Tuesday.         
	Symonds will not face any charge. A streaker is not a spectator as he had entered the ground illegally, an ICC spokesman said.         
	According to the ICCs section 4.2 of the Code of Conduct, a player could be banned from any physical assault of a rival player, official or spectator.         
	Symomds was at the non-strikers end when the incident took place. When the man ran onto the pitch naked, trying to evade the police by approaching in the direction of Symonds, the allrounder leaned onto him in a rugby-style shoulder charge and grounded him in the 10th over of the Australian innings.

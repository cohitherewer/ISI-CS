The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taufel relishes Yuvis sixers
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Taufel relishes Yuvis sixers
                      
	Dubai: Simon Taufel, the man officiating at the all-important end during the over when Yuvraj Singh hit the ICC award winning six sixes, said it was quite an experience watching the Indian unleash his array of strokes.         
	It was quite an experience, Taufel told reporters on Wednesday night on the sidelines of the ICC Awards 2008 after Yuvraj bagged the International Performance of the Year Award 2008 for slamming six sixes off Stuart Broad at the World Twenty20 match between India and England in South Africa.         
	Taufel himself bagged the Best Umpire Award for the fifth consecutive year. Asked about the pressure of converting the final deliveries into sixes after hitting the first four, Yuvraj said it was the other way around.         
	When you hit four sixes, the pressure is on the bowler. There were some butterflies in my stomach but I backed myself and hit two more sixes, Yuvraj said.         
	I have got hit for five sixes myself so I know how it feels, Yuvraj said.         
	He also dismissed questions posed by the media on his relations with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and an argument during the Sri Lanka tour wherein spinner Harbhajan Singh had to intervene.         
	We are here for the awards and we should talk just about just that, he said. (PTI)

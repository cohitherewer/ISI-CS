The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav to play vs Vidarbha
                                                                                                                                                                                           Sourav to play vs Vidarbha
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Seven days after quitting international cricket, Sourav Ganguly returned to the place where it all began. As a spectator though.         
	The former India captain spent around 40 minutes at the Eden on Monday, to watch the ongoing Bengal-Services Ranji Trophy Plate group match.         
	On a day when his one-time protg Yuvraj Singh forced the English bowlers into submission in Indore, Sourav arrived during the lunch break and leftafter debutant Rohan Banerjee completed his century.         
	He didnt step into the dressing room but spent the time chatting with secretary Arun Mitra under the canopy.         
	In between, he watched the Bengal batsmen do a round of knocking from the sidelines and even returned a few of the balls that had rolled over.         
	Giving in to desperate requests from the CAB, Sourav confirmed he will play for Bengal in their last Plate League encounter against Vidarbha, from December 12-15 in Nagpur, where he played his final Test.         
	There is also speculation that Muttiah Muralidharan may play the match against Vidarbha.         
	The new dates for Bengals match against Assam, though, havent been announced.         
	Should Bengal make the knock-out stage, the left-hander will continue playing.         
	If Sourav plays the match against Vidarbha, the CAB felicitation, slated for December 14, will have to be postponed again. He asked us to postpone the felicitation as playing for his state was more important. We will discuss about a fresh date later, Mitra said.

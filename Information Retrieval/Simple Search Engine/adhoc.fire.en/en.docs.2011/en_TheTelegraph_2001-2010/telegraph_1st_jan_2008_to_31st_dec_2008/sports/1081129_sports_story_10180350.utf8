                                                                                                                                                                                                     Maradona visit
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Diego Maradonas visit to the city is not likely to be postponed in the wake of the terrorist attack in Mumbai.         
	The legends personal manager Sebastian de Monte sent an e-mail to Bhaswar Goswami, the executive director of the city-based firm which is managing Maradonas visit, enquiring if the city would be safe to visit.         
	Sebastian mailed me saying Diego and Claudia (Maradonas estranged wife) have come to know about the developments in Mumbai and want to know how safe your city is, Goswami said.         
	When I replied saying there was nothing to worry about, he immediately mailed back and said Diego and Claudia have started packing their bags for the trip to Calcutta, he added.         
	Meanwhile, Bhaichung Bhutia on Friday suggested the prize money for the match between Chief Ministers XI and External Affairs Ministers XI to be played in honour of Diego Maradona be given to needy former Olympians.

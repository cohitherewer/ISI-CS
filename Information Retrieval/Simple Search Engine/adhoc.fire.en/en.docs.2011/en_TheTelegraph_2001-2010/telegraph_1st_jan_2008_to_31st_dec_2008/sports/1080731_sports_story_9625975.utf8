                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sania moves up
                      
	Stockholm: Sania Mirza had mixed luck on the opening day of the Nordea Nordic Light Open as she advanced to the second round of the singles competition but made a stunning first-round exit from the doubles event on Wednesday.         
	Seeded sixth in singles, Sania beat Frenchwoman Emilie Loit 6-3, 6-2 to set up a clash with Czech Iveta Benesova in the $145,000 tier four, hard-court event.         
	In a lopsided encounter, the Indian ace who has plummeted to 50th in the WTA charts owing to a string of poor performances, outplayed Loit.

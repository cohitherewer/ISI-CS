                                                   Manoj among standbys

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary is among the standbys for the tri-series in Australia. Yusuf Pathan and Munaf Patel have also been included in the standby list. 
    
	We decided to have three players as standbys so that in case of injuries to any player, we can fly themout immediately to help the team, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said in Mumbai on Sunday. 
    
	Shah dismissed reports of Yuvraj Singhs alleged attitude problems and said: There was no mention of it in any report... Its all media creation. 
    
	The national selectors decision to pick Robin Uthappa and Rohit Sharma in the squad defied logic. Both failed to make an impression during this seasons Ranji Trophy though the selectors would make us believe otherwise. 
    
	In five Ranji matches, Uthappa has scored 188 runs at an average of 26.85 (highest 55). Rohit managed 191 in as many matches at an average of 27.28 (highest 62). 
    
	Shah also said that the injured Zaheer Khan might be sent to South Africa. He suffered a heel injury and returned after the first Test.

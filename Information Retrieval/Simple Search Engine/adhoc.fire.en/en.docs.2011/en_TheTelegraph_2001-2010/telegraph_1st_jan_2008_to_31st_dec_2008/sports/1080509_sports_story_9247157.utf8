The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sunny steps down from ICC post
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sunny steps down from ICC post
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sunil Gavaskar                           
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday confirmed that Sunil Gavaskar had relinquished his role as chairman of the ICC cricket committee.         
	According to an ICC release, the former India captain conveyed his decision to the world body on Wednesday, a day after chairing this years meeting in Dubai.         
	ICC acting chief executive David Richards said: We are indebted to the work Sunil has put into his role as chairman of the committee.         
	He has brought his vast experience of the game to bear not only on the eight years of his chairmanship but also the six years prior to that when he was a delegate.         
	Having someone of his stature has been beneficial to the game and given the ICCs lengthy relationship with Sunil we hope we can still utilise his knowledge in some capacity in the future.         
	Gavaskar, on his part, said his decision has been ruled by media commitments.         
	I have thoroughly enjoyed the eight years of being the chairman, which is an honorary position, and it has been extremely fulfilling to be able to give back to the game through that role.         
	However, with more and more cricket being played it has become clear that it wouldnt be possible for me to do justice to two jobs  chairmanship of the cricket committee and media commitments.         
	As an example, I had to skip my professional commitments as a commentator on the Indian Premier League matches to come and chair this years meeting in Dubai.         
	I envisaged the potential for such an issue two years ago and had made it clear that I may not be able to continue in the role but when I was asked to do so I was honoured to be re-elected.         
	Now, however, it is clear that I cannot combine both duties and therefore I am relinquishing the chair of the cricket committee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A capital offence of 50m
                                                                                                                                                                                           A capital offence of 50m

	So, at last we have an all-English final. Or, to be more accurate, America versus Russia (yes, the old Cold War derby), a contest between the Glazers borrowed dollars and Roman Abramovichs strategically invested roubles. With home advantage, on top of all his others, to the oligarch  the only advantage, Id say, that anyone other than profiteering hoteliers, ticket touts and the like will obtain from the disgraceful decision to award the Champions League climax to Moscow.         
	The demonstration of stark capitalism currently unfolding before our bemused eyes  on Saturday I got an email from a private-jet firm offering day trips for 4,000  will cost the fans of Manchester United and Chelsea (at a conservative estimate) some 50million more than would have been the case had the match been hastily redirected to Wembley. On top of that, there is the events unnecessarily heavy carbon footprint  not to mention the inevitable misery entailed in such a concentration of flights between England and Russia.         
	Meanwhile a few thousand Russian fans, those who follow Zenit St Petersburg, must travel in the opposite direction to Manchester for the Uefa Cup final. If they are subjected to anything like the trouble and expense the English have encountered in trying to get visas - and the Russian Embassy swear it is worse the other way round - I feel sorry for them.         
	Why is this madness tolerated? It is all to do with footballing politics and corporate entertaining. Whoever chose Moscow deserves to choke on his caviar. Indeed, after Liverpool supporters experiences in Athens last year  remember all those promises to learn from them?  it is breathtaking that once again the venue has been casually agreed in advance without any thought for those who must dig deepest in order to attend it.         
	The only wonder is the fans are not also being asked to pay for the replacement of the Luzhniki Stadiums artificial pitch with grass; the hosts, with the help of an Englishman, are taking care of that and we are left to cross our fingers and hope against hope they make a half-decent job of it, because the ultimate ruination of this Champions League season, after those glorious second legs of the semi-finals last week, would be a footballing sin.         
	Thank goodness for the 90 minutes of enthralling technique at Old Trafford  farewell, Barcelona, and best wishes for next season because there are worse flaws than over-elaboration  and 120 of riveting combat at Stamford Bridge, where almost every mistake, it seemed, was forced by the rigour of the challenges that flew in (fairly, for the most part). The two crucial errors, however, were oddly unforced. Each came from a right back: Gianluca Zambrotta, who inadvertently set up Paul Scholess magnificent goal in Manchester, and Alvaro Arbeloa, whose failure to intercept let Salomon Kalou away before Didier Drogba seized the initiative in London.         
	The game, of course, is about players  and in this respect Chelsea have every bit as much to fear from Cristiano Ronaldo as United have from Drogba  but in Moscow the stark contrast in experience between the managers will add spice to the occasion. As if it were needed; a minimum of 90 minutes of drama looms. But will the logistical nightmare be worth it?

	Beijing: Former Olympic and world 100m champion Maurice Greene announced his retirement on Monday. The 33-year-old American, who also held the 100m world record of 9.79 seconds for more than three years, said a calf injury he sustained in training last month had convinced him to end his career.
 
	Today Im officially announcing my retirement from the sport, he told reporters here. I dont think I can have that mental battle with myself coming back from injury any more. It takes a lot out of you mentally ... you start getting down and then you get depressed. This is Olympic year, something I wanted to do so bad. So I just decided to call it quits ... I want other people in the sport to shine.
 
	A native of Kansas City, Greene made his breakthrough by claiming the 100m gold at the 1997 world championships. In June 1999 in Athens, he ran a world record time of 9.79, carving five hundredths of a second off Donovan Baileys three year old mark.
 
	That same August in Seville, he became first man to win the 100m and 200m titles at a single world championships and a year later he won the Olympic 100m at the Sydney Games. He added another Olympic gold in the sprint relay. His world mark survived until Tim Montgomery ran 9.78 in 2002, although Montgomery was later stripped of the record after being found guilty of using banned substances.
 
	Ive had so many highlights, my first Olympic gold medal, my first world championship gold, breaking the world record indoors and outside, Greene said. All of them mean something to me, something special in my heart. I just wanted to be the best I could be, I wanted to be the greatest of all time.
 
	Tyson Gay, who matched Greenes sprint double at last years world championships in Osaka and hopes to repeat the feat at the Beijing Olympics, was surprised by his compatriots retirement.
 
	Its a shocker to me, he said. Not having Maurice Greene around in track and field any more is just like Michael Jordan retiring from basketball, or Tiger Woods retiring. Hes the greatest.
 
	Greene, who ran the 100m in less than 10 seconds a record 52 times, said he hoped the success of his career would be measured not just by the four Olympic medals and five world championship gold medals he won. I hope people remember me as a great athlete but more than anything as a great person to be around, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib among probables
                                                                                                                                                                                             Shoaib among probables
                  Shoaib Akhtar                     
	Karachi: Controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar made a comeback while senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf and dope-tainted pacer Mohammed Asif were left out of Pakistans 30-member Champions Trophy preliminary squad on Tuesday.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), announcing the squad in Lahore at a press conference, said Yousuf had requested not be considered for the event because of his religious commitments.         
	Since the Champions Trophy falls in the month of Ramazan, Yousuf said he should not be considered for selection for the tournament, said Shafqat Naghmi, chief operating officer of the board.         
	There was much speculation about whether Shoaib would make the Champions Trophy preliminary squad since last week, after the selectors confirmed he was on their list for the tournament. But the board had made it clear that Shoaib would only be considered if he paid the fine of seven million rupees imposed on him by the appellate tribunal last month.         
	Shoaib, through his lawyer, informed the board that he would not pay the fine immediately as his writ petition was still pending in the Lahore High Court.         
	Since he has committed to pay the fine when the court reaches a decision, we have no problems. We never said he would not be considered if he didnt pay the fine immediately, Naghmi said in a change of heart.         
	The change apparently came after Asif, who was in the preliminary squad, was dropped after it was reported that he failed a dope test during the Indian Premier League.         
	We want to give Shoaib a legitimate chance to prove his fitness and win back his place in the team, Naghmi said.         
	The Lahore High Court, earlier this month, suspended the 18-month ban imposed on Shoaib by the appellate tribunal. Naghmi also disclosed that all the selected players would undergo dope tests in Lahore on July 19 and 20 of this month.         
	Any player who fails the test or avoids giving a sample, would not be considered for the final Champions Trophy squad and will also face disciplinary action under our anti-doping regulations, Naghmi said.         
	The selectors included Shoaib because they believe that since there is much time left before the start of the Champions Trophy, he should not be ignored for selection, one source said.         
	The selectors believe that if available he should play for Pakistan and strengthen the pace attack, he added.

            HENRY WINTER            Wayne Rooney                           
	Wayne Rooney is struggling with a virus that threatens his start to the season at Manchester United while Cristiano Ronaldo will not return to the fold until Friday, although a bullish Sir Alex Ferguson stressed that Real Madrids No. 1 target would be with United next season.         
	Ronaldo, who still covets a move to Madrid before the August 31 transfer deadline, is due to see Ferguson at Carrington for what could prove a lively meeting. Hes a Manchester United player, emphasised the United manager. Its finished. Hes here. Hes going to play here next season. Its all over.         
	Although the saga will close only when Ronaldo declares his intentions for the forthcoming season, Fergusons confidence about retaining the Footballer of the Year, certainly for one more year, was increased by Tuesdays latest bulletin from the Bernabeu.         
	Ramon Calderon, Reals president, introduced the Dutch attacker Rafael van der Vaart as Madrids first and certainly only signing of the summer.         
	We believe this squad is full of quality, of plenty of talent, added Calderon.         
	With Ronaldo injured, Ferguson needs Rooney to recover quickly. Its a virus hes picked up in Nigeria and its not a nice one, said Ferguson.         
	Weve done all the investigation. All he had was malaria tablets and it was nothing to do with that. It wasnt malaria. I doubt well get Rooney for the start of the season.         
	Rooney is definitely out of Sundays Community Shield, probably out of the first Premier League game of the season against Newcastle United on August 17, and a major doubt for Englands friendly with the Czech Republic at Wembley on August 20.         
	Michael Carrick returned to Carrington only Tuesday while Park Ji-sung, Gary Neville and Ronaldo are all out with Louis Saha seemingly out of favour. Ferguson really has only Carlos Tevez and Fraizer Campbell to select up front, although the Double winners continue to be linked with Tottenham Hotspurs Dimitar Berbatov.

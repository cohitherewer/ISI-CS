                                                    Scoring a hundred isnt everything: Sachin

 - It Will be an honour if I get knighted, says senior-most pro 
   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
                  
	Adelaide: The Master, as Team India mates call Sachin Tendulkar, scripted yet another Test hundred  39th overall and first at the Adelaide Oval  on Thursday. Later, he took questions from the media and, on returning to the Hyatt, briefly spoke separately to The Telegraph. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
       
	On whether hed been more determined to get a hundred at the Adelaide Oval as its one venue where he didnt have a three-figure innings (previous best being 61 in 1999-00) in Tests 
    
	I knew this hadnt been a great ground and, so, I was determined... Yes... I realised I had to get a big one... This also happens to be Sir Dons home ground... 
    
	On whether his latest hundred could be seen as a tribute to Sir Don 
    
	When I was batting, I obviously wasnt thinking of that... I was concentrating on what I had to do, but Im very pleased with this hundred. 
    
	On whether hed like to dedicate it to anybody 
    
	(Shrugs) Well, no... 
    
	On whether he sees this hundred as one of his most complete innings 
    
	A hundred is special, more so when the team needs it... Im quite happy, for I played some big shots and also defended... It was important to stay out there, watch the ball and play on merit... If somebodys bowling well, like Brett Lee, then you need to give him respect and play out that spell. 
    
	On having hit two hundreds (No.1 in Sydney) in the first 24 days of the year 
    
	I havent been counting, but its nice that theyre coming my way. Im enjoying it. 
    
	On being conscious about venues where he hasnt got a Test hundred 
    
	Generally, not really... But scoring a hundred isnt everything and theres more to cricket... Ive been focusing that way and, if in doing so, one gets a hundred then why not? 
    
	On the standing ovation hes been receiving at grounds across Australia 
    
	Its truly special, very overwhelming... Sometimes I need to look at the scoreboard to figure out whether Im batting on a 100-plus or Im on zero! The fantastic ovation has made this trip very, very special... I want to thank each and everyone. 
    
	On whether Australia can be considered his second home 
    
	(Laughs) I have only one home, India... 
    
	On whether its been an emotional period for him 
    
	I dont want to be emotional... I want to stay focused and get runs... I havent been thinking that this could be my last Test (in Australia). 
    
	On Australia bringing the best out of him 
    
	Ive always tried to give off my best against every opposition... Australias a tough team and its challenging to score against them... Its satisfying as well. 
    
	On having been content with throw-downs instead of full-fledged nets in the build-up to the Test 
    
	I go with whatever I need to work on... If there are areas where I feel I need to be working on, then I do so... I dont bother much about whether I should be getting into the nets or... I go by the feel... By what I feel comfortable... If I feel Im ready for the match, then other things dont matter. 
    
	On when does he feel that hes really in when out in the middle 
    
	Its a tough question... Hadnt thought about it... When youre middling the ball is when you know youre in... There are days when the feet move well and there are days when they dont... You need to wait for the particular moment when your level of confidence shoots up.. 
    
	On when that moment came on Day I 
    
	Probably when I played the first straight drive off Lee... I middled the ball well and the shot went exactly where I wanted it to. 
    
	On having hit a six (off Michael Clarke) in the nineties 
    
	The wind was behind me and I thought I should use it a bit... I knew that even if I didnt middle the ball, the wind would still help. I timed it well. 
    
	On whether he had to restrain himself after that six took him to 98 
    
	If the ball was there to be put away, I was prepared to do so again... 
    
	On the wind also being a factor for batsmen 
    
	Absolutely. 
    
	On Lees bowling 
    
	He had a fantastic second spell... Hes been their top bowler throughout the series and hasnt given us any breathing space at all. Right through, hes bowled in fantastic areas. 
    
	On having taken on Brad Hogg 
    
	There were patches when he bowled well and there were patches when I thought I could put the ball away... I waited for those opportunities and made it count. 
    
	On whether, more than being guided by the conditions, he sets out to target specific bowlers 
    
	No... I dont think like that... Any bowler can get you out, so I dont take things for granted... One can get into trouble if one does that... It depends on the flow of my innings... If I pick the ball early enough, then Ill put it away. 
    
	On whether hes open to suggestions from those around him 
    
	Always open, even if Im batting well, because there are times when you dont realise what mistakes are being made... However, the non-striker immediately notices them... I keep telling teammates that dont wait for me to repeat a mistake... Im open to advice, opinions... That can only make you a better player... Im an easy-going person. 
    
	On Team India fielding five specialist bowlers 
    
	The decision has to be commented upon by the captain (Anil Kumble)... No.2 onwards our batting order didnt change... Irfan Pathan opened because hed done well against the second new ball in Perth... Hed got useful runs and isnt someone who is a tailender... He can bat and has a big heart. 
    
	On the road ahead for India in the final Test 
    
	Putting up a big total in the first innings will be the key... Later on, the wicket could have big cracks... Wed like to score as many as possible tomorrow (Friday)... Well give it our best shot... Put up our best performance... The first spells tomorrow are going to be important... 
    
	On the role he expects Kumble and Harbhajan Singh to play 
    
	A big one... The wicket has bounce for the spinners too... The cracks will also start widening... Its a fantastic track right now and we need to concentrate harder. 
    
	On sporting a Bjorn Borg-like stubble 
    
	(Laughs) I enjoyed his and John McEnroes tennis... I supported McEnroe, though... No, the stubble has nothing to do with Borg. 
    
	On pairing up with Roger Federer, in the near future, for a social cause-specific ad commissioned by the Swiss 
    
	Of course Im excited... McEnroe was my favourite, Federer is... However, I dont have details of the shoot as yet. 
    
	Finally, on British Prime Minister Gordon Browns call for the likes of him to be considered for knighthood 
    
	Frankly, Im not aware of the technicalities, but it will be an honour if I get knighted.

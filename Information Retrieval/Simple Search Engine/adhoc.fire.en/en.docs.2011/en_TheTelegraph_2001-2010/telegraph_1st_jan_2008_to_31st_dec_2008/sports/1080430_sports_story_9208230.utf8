  - Advantage lies with Chelsea now, says Liverpool captain Gerrard             Chelsea coach Avram Grant                           
	London: Chelsea hold the aces going into the second leg of their Champions League semi-final at home to Liverpool on Wednesday.         
	Liverpool may have the tradition and five European Cups to their name but John Arne Riises own goal deep into stoppage time in the first leg at Anfield last Tuesday handed Chelsea a priceless away goal and a 1-1 draw.         
	Chelsea start as favourites to reach the final for the first time and as long as Avram Grants men stop Liverpool from finding the net they will face Manchester United or Barcelona in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on May 21.         
	Liverpool and Chelsea, meeting in their third Champions League semi-final in four seasons, will be facing each other for the 20th time in all competitions in that period.         
	The Anfield club won both previous semis in 2005 and 2007 but Chelsea will be in good spirits after their battling 2-1 win over Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday kept alive their hopes of a double.         
	Chelsea also have an excellent recent record over Liverpool, who have not scored in eight visits to Stamford Bridge since Rafa Benitez took charge at Anfield in 2004.         
	The Londoners have turned Stamford Bridge into a fortress, having not lost a domestic match since February 2004 and any game since losing 1-2 to Barcelona in the first leg of the Champions League first knockout round in February 2006.         
	Chelsea are also likely to have Frank Lampard back in the squad after the England midfielder missed the United match following the death of his mother two days previously.         
	Lampard resumed training on Sunday, according to media reports, but even if he declares himself ready to return, Grant might be tempted to retain the midfielders who performed so well against United, led by two-goal German Michael Ballack.         
	Liverpool are a tougher proposition in Europe than in domestic matches and Benitez will take a rested squad to London, having made nine changes from the side that played Chelsea last week for Saturdays 2-2 Premier League draw at Birmingham City.         
	Fernando Torres, who has scored 30 goals in 43 matches since joining Liverpool at the start of the season, poses the biggest danger while Steven Gerrard will look to add to the 21 he has netted from midfield.         
	But as long as the hosts do not concede a goal Chelsea will be bound for Moscow, a thought to delight their billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich.         
	But Riise is finished dwelling on his last-second own-goal in the first leg.         
	After spending a day to recover from the ill-fated clearance header that sent the ball into his own net  and gave Chelsea an edge ahead of the return leg - the Norway defender said hes hoping for a chance to make amends at Stamford Bridge.         
	Nobody wants to score an own goal but people make mistakes  and nobody will blame me if its 0-0 on Wednesday and we dont go through, Riise said. But nobody is even thinking about that. We are going to try and get a win and hopefully we will get it. Then the first-leg result and the own goal wont matter. We know we can do it.         
	Riise said he spent last Wednesday mulling over the mistake.         
	I just went home and I didnt want to speak to anyone. I just had to think about it myself, he said. I realised you just have to move on and now I think I have.         
	According to Benitez, the pressure is on Chelsea, with fans feeling a spot in the final is long overdue.         
	I think they want to win clearly and all their supporters will push and try to support the team, Benitez said Tuesday. The players know its an important game for them  three years to (get to) the final, they will be a little bit under pressure.         
	Gerrard is also confident his side can again rise to the occasion in European play.         
	Ill be realistic and say the advantage lies with Chelsea now, Gerrard said. They are a very good team and they have been very strong at home for a long time. But we have shown over the last few years that we are a very good team away from home in Europe  and we want to go to Stamford Bridge and prove ourselves again.

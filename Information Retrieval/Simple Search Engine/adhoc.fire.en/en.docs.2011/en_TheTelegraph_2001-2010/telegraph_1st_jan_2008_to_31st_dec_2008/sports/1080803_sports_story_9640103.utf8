The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India face do-or-die battle today
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India face do-or-die battle today
                      
	Hyderabad: Lacklustre performances in the first two league games have put India in a do-or-die situation in their final group a match against Turkmenistan on Sunday and only a win would see them through to the semi-finals of the AFC Challenge Cup football tournament here.         
	With four points from two matches, a win on Sunday will also put India on top of the group and help them avoid a clash with title favourites North Korea in the cross-legged semi-finals.         
	Turkmenistan are also on four points while defending champions Tajikistan  who play Afghanistan in their last group match simultaneously on Sunday  are on two points after a couple of draws.         
	A draw for India may not be enough for them to get the last-four berth. In that case, the hosts, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan  if they beat Afghanistan  will have five points each.         
	Turkmenistan will be through to semi-finals with better goal difference after thrashing Afghanistan 5-0 on Friday and Tajikistan could pip India if they beat Afghanistan by a 2-0 margin.         
	But beating Turkmenistan will be no stroll in the park for Bob Houghtons charges as the central Asians, who are without a couple of key players from their first team due to non-release by top clubs in Russia and neighbouring countries, have been peaking at the right time.         
	They could not score against Tajikistan in their first match despite dominating most part of the match, but against the Afghans they banged in five and their morale must be high after that.         
	That should be an ominous sign for the hosts, whose defenders have been having a nightmarish time in the tournament so far.         
	And, with their forwards largely struggling to create the chances, let alone getting the finishing touches, it would need a vastly improved performance by the Bhaichung Bhutia-led side, who are nurturing hopes of qualifying for the 2011 Asian Cup by winning this meet.         
	Against lowly-ranked Afghanistan, India were saved the blushes by an injury-time goal by Climax Lawrence after a patchy show with both the defence and forward line doing nothing to write about.         
	Part of the problem has been that the Indian defence, which was in fine fettle during the Nehru Cup, has been a shaky area. (PTI)

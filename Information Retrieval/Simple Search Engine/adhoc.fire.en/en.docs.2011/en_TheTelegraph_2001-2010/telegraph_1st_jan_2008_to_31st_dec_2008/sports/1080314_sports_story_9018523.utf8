                                                   Ive more to offer: Dennis
                      
	Melbourne: McLaren boss Ron Dennis said on Thursday he had intended to stand down last year but decided he still had something to offer the Formula One team.         
	(Chief executive) Martin (Whitmarsh) has taken more and more responsibility over the last three years, that was by design, the 60-year-old told reporters on arrival at the Australian Grand Prix.         
	I had thought pretty much at the beginning of last season it would be my last grand prix season of going to races, purely because of how long Ive done it.         
	I am just a guy that enjoys going motor racing and if I dont feel I have something positive to do, then I wouldnt be here, said Dennis.         
	I am continuing as team principal but it is the smallest part of my job and one Martin definitely has wanted to have for a while. He will have to wait a little bit longer (REUTERS)

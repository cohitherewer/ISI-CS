                                                    My career is yet to peak: Maria

 - Serena, Nadal to play on main court on Day I 
      World No. 1 and Australian Open defending champion Roger Federer during a training session in Melbourne on Saturday 
             
	Melbourne: Maria Sharapova has two Grand Slam titles in the bag and has attained world No. 1 status, but the Russian still believes her best is yet to come. 
    
	The world No. 5, a favourite for the Australian Open beginning on Monday, won Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004 and believes she is still getting better. 
    
	I love the work that I put in on the court and I know that some day it will pay off, Sharapova, runner-up in Melbourne 12 months ago, told reporters on Saturday. 
    
	Saying that, Im still 20 years old. Ive said it many times, I dont think this is the peak of my career. I believe that there are many more years to go, and Im going to learn from all those experiences within those years. 
    
	Sharapova said world No. 1 Justine Henin was the big favourite and that defending champion Serena Williams and her sister Venus were also big threats for the title. 
    
	But the Russian said her never-say-die attitude would stand her in good stead over the next fortnight. 
    
	Ive proven it before and Ive done it before, so I dont think you can ever count me out, she said. 
    
	No matter how confident or not, no matter where my ranking is, Im one of the toughest competitors out there. I never leave the court without giving 100 per cent, and thats why I think I gain a lot of respect from my fans and from the tennis audience. Its what I love to do. 
    
	Sharapova suffered a shoulder injury in 2007 that caused her to alter her service action, but said she felt fully fit after the off-season and was raring to go. 
    
	Im feeling really good, she said. I had a really good off-season. Injury-free. I worked really hard. I put a lot of dedication into it. Waking up every single morning, I was looking forward to practice, getting better. 
    
	The fifth seed could face former world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport in the second round in what will be the Americans first Grand Slam tournament in 16 months, after a year off in which she had her first child. 
    
	Sharapova said she would be in for a tough match if she faced the American, champion at Melbourne Park in 2000. 
    
	A most unlikely champion here 12 months ago, Serena is back to jealously guard her Australian Open title and is feeling in tip-top condition. 
    
	My body will allow anything really. Its ready for anything, she said. 
    
	Serena, world No. 1 Henin and mens No. 2 Rafael Nadal head the order of play on the main show court on the first day of the Australian Open on Monday. 
    
	Williams, the seventh seed, will meet Australian wildcard Jarmila Gajdosova as the curtain-raiser match on Rod Laver Arena before Henin meets Aiko Nakamura of Japan. 
    
	Britians world number nine Andy Murray ends the day session of matches with his clash against Frances Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, while Nadal will close the days play with his match against Serbian qualifier Viktor Troicki. 
    
	Sharapova and world No. 6 Andy Roddick headline the days action on the Vodafone Arena. 
    
	Sharapova will met Croatias Jelena Kostanic Tosic, while Roddick, who won his third successive Kooyong Classic with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Cypruss Marcos Baghdatis on Saturday, will meet qualifier Lukas Dlouhy from the Czech Republic.

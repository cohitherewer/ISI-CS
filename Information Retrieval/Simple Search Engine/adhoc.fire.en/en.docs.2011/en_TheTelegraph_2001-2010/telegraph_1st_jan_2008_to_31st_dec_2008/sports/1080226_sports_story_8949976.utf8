The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds a big asset: Laxman
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Symonds a big asset: Laxman  
	Hyderabad: V.V.S. Laxman, the captain of the Hyderabad team in the IPL, Monday said the presence of Andrew Symonds in the side was a big asset because of his match-winning abilities. Laxman did not envisage any crowd problems for the allrounder who not only accused Harbhajan Singh of racially abusing him but has been involved on-field altercations with the Indians.  
	He is a match-winner for us and obviously if he does well for the team, the crowd will love him. It is a great asset to have Symonds in our team, Laxman said. When there is high intense cricket, I am sure there will be a few words exchanged and that is because of the heat of the moment.         
	The Hyderabad team bid a whopping Rs 5.6 crore for Symonds. I have known Symonds since under-19 days. He is a very good friend of mine and he is a thorough professional, he said.    
	May rsquo;s concern  
	 Hobart: The Indian Premier League (IPL) could encourage match-fixing if the cash-rich Twenty20 tournament is not brought under the purview of the ICCs Anti Corruption Unit, said Tim May, who heads the union of international players. Even though IPL has been approved by the ICC, the ACU officers might not necessarily be present at the cash-rich Twenty20 tournament which is a domestic tournament. May said Twenty20 cricket was arguably at a higher risk of corruption than Test and ODIs.                 
	Kaif hopeful  
	Jaipur: India discard Mohammed Kaif feels no cricketer will think IPL more important than donning the national colours. Its ok to play in IPL but the satisfaction and pride that you get by playing for India is unbeatable, Kaif, who will play for Jaipur team, said. Out of the national team for close to a year, Kaif said he was not disheartened by not being in the side despite his good record in the domestic circuit and was hopeful for making a comeback soon.    
	Stanford offer  
	Melbourne: Apparently trying to compete with the IPL, Texan billionaire Allen Stanford has offered Australian, English and Indian cricketers $20 million from a single twenty20 match next year in the West Indies. He is wooing Australian and English cricketers to play against an all-star team from around the West Indies for a prize of $20 million.    
	Pawar view  
	Mumbai: The BCCI president, Sharad Pawar, Monday said the Indian players needed a break of at least 10 days between their current engagement in Australia and the next home series against South Africa to explain the reasons for the BCCIs inability to visit Pakistan next month.   
	Pawar said in normal circumstances they would have readily agreed to play three ODIs in March but they had to turn down the PCBs request because of the Indians tight schedule.                 
	WI-Pak ODIs  
	Abu Dhabi: West Indies and Pakistan will play a three-match one-day series in November in Abu Dhabi. Dilawar Mani, chief executive of the Abu Dhabi Cricket Club, on Monday said: This is not connected to the ICCs schedule  it is a separate tour. We looked at the Future Tours Programme and found a window of opportunity and we went for it.

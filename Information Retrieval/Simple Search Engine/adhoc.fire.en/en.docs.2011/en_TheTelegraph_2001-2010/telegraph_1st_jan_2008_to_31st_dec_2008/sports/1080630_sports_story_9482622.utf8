The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hamilton may need to take a backseat 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hamilton may need to take a backseat 
            KEVIN GARSIDE             Lewis Hamilton                           
	A crowd of 45,000 colonised a corner of rural Northamptonshire last Thursday to watch Lewis Hamilton lay waste to Copse, Maggots and Becketts en route to the quickest time of the week at the Silverstone test.         
	The night before in London, Hamilton was listing the night away with his Pussycat Doll, Nicole Scherzinger, giving Nelson Mandela a hand with his 90th birthday knees-up.         
	On Saturday he was anchored to a sponsors boat for the Round the Island yacht race in Cowes, Isle of Wight, and in the evening at Brooklands fulfilling yet another PR obligation. On Tuesday Hamilton will be announced in Amsterdam as the face of Reebok.         
	And on it goes; brand Hamilton relentlessly spreading the gospel on and off the track. Hamilton is not the first sportsman to trip the light fantastic. It is a tale told most recently in a book by David Coulthard.         
	The oldest swinger in F1 has neither the talent nor the celebrity of Hamilton, but in a successful career at Williams, McLaren and now Red Bull, he has tasted enough of this sporting life to comprehend the champagne bubble embracing the one-man industry that Hamilton is becoming.         
	Hamilton has no rival in the pit lane for pulling power. Fernando Alonso is a relative recluse, Kimi Who has to be shoe-horned into his Ferrari overalls outside of office hours. Robert Kubica is worshipped in Warsaw. So what? Hamiltons constituency is universal. Even in Spain, where the love of Alonso runs deep, Hamilton has serious admirers.         
	In times of trouble, and the past two races have been nothing but for Hamilton, the extra-curricular stuff is used in evidence against you. When you are winning you can do what you like. In Turkey,         
	Hamilton was given a kicking by some over his participation in a PR event that had him suspended from a rope. Having failed in Malaysia and Bahrain, the feeling was he had no business pulling stunts for sponsors.         
	If you put yourself out there, there are going to be observations of where youre going, what youre doing, Coulthard said. People will start to feel that they own a little bit more of you than if you keep a low profile. But that is a decision I am sure Lewis is well able to make.         
	I dont think he will, but if you choose to fill that free time full of yahooing and all the rest of it then you are going to turn up at a grand prix relaxing rather than getting on with it.         
	I never had the spotlight that Lewis has. I cant imagine what it is like. To be the first black driver in F1, almost winning a world championship; all those things must be incredible.         
	But Lewis unquestionably has everything he needs to be a world champion. He is one of the, if not the most, well prepared rookies. The only thing that he doesnt have is the mental experience and development that inevitably comes through life.         
	We are all better able to make decisions at the age we are today than when we were 23. Thats just a fact, it is not a criticism. He will make more informed decisions in two and five years time.         
	Coulthard was in the race seat alongside Mika Hakkinen when Hamilton was signed to the junior driver scheme at McLaren in 1998. He jokes that he saw Hamilton through puberty. Hamilton will see him into the nursing home in return.         
	The pair remain close, regularly abusing each other by text. The mobile phone traffic will be molten at Silverstone. Hamilton has every chance of following suit.

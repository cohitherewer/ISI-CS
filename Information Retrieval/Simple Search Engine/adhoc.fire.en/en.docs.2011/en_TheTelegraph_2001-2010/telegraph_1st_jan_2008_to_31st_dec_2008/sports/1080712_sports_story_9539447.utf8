The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev cards 3-under
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeev cards 3-under
          
	Glasgow: Jeev Milkha Singh was the lone Indian to break par in the opening round of the Barclays Scottish Open, carding a three-under 68 to be placed tied 19th in the $5.92 million event at Loch Lomond.         
	Jeev, who has to finish among the top-five here to qualify for the British Open, sank in four birdies against a lone bogey to be four strokes off the pace.         
	The other Indians in fray  Shiv Kapur (71) and S.S.P. Chowrasia (72) however, made disappointing starts to their campaign and were placed tied 77th and 98th respectively after the opening round.         
	Jeev played out a steady round and picked up birdies on the first and third hole in his flawless front nine to make the turn two-under.         
	A 10th hole bogey pulled him back in the other nine but he made up for the lapse with back-to-back birdies on the 13th and 14th.         
	Meanwhile, Kapur and Chowrasia, both 10th tee starters, were undone by poor front nines.         
	With birdies on 13th and 18th, Kapur was placed nicely at two-under after the halfway mark but a double-bogey on the first and a bogey on the fifth spoilt his round.         
	Although he managed to end it with a birdie on the ninth, it could not help him break par.           (PTI)

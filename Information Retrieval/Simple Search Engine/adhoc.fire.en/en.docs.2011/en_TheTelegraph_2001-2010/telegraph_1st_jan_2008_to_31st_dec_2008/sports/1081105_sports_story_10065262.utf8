                  Harbhajan Singh                     
	Nagpur: India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who missed the drawn third Test against Australia because of a toe injury, on Tuesday declared himself fully fit to play the crucial fourth and final match here from Thursday.         
	I am fully fit, said Harbhajan after the teams practice session at the old VCA stadium.         
	Harbhajan said the entire team was looking forward to winning the series 2-0 by clinching the Test here and would not let the retirement of Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly to distract them.         
	Our focus will be there to win the series 2-0 by winning the Test here. We are all looking forward to playing at the new stadium. We intend to go and practise there tomorrow, he said.         
	On the break-up of his excellent combination with veteran leg-spinner Kumble following the latters retirement after the third Test at Delhi, the combative bowler said he would definitely miss bowling alongside the leg-spinner, who has grabbed over 600 Test wickets.         
	I have always enjoyed bowling with Anil bhai who is a great bowler. I will miss him definitely. But Im sure whoever replaces him would be good enough and will perform well in course of time, he said.         
	On the upcoming Test match, Harbhajan said it was a very important game and the entire team was looking forward to play good cricket and win it.         
	Its a very important game for us. We all want to play top-class cricket and win it and with it the series 2-0. We are not worried about the new wicket and stadium, Harbhajan said.         
	The Test will be played at the newly built-stadium in Jamtha, 16 km from here.         
	Harbhajan also said that though he wanted to complete 300 Test wickets at Mohalihe would be happy to complete the feat at Nagpur. I would have loved to complete 300 wickets in Mohali, which did not happen. But I would be happy to get it here.         
	The off-spinner said speedster Zaheer Khan and Sourav missed Tuesdays practice to rest at the team hotel. They wanted to take rest. They are fatigued, he said.         
	It was learnt that Sourav would take part in the optional net session on Wednesday.

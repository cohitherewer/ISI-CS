	Canberra: ICC chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle has requested rival captains Anil Kumble and Ricky Ponting to be present for a cool-off session in Perth on Monday, two days before the third Test begins at the Waca. 
    
	It is learnt that Kumble and Ponting have been asked if they could meet in Perth in order to set right their fractured relationship. 
    
	Kumble had extended an olive branch by declaring on arrival here that he would have no problem in meeting Ponting at Madugalles initiative. 
    
	The Australian captain, too, softened his approach by saying in a local newspaper that he would ask his teammates to assemble in Perth and review a few things they had done during the Sydney Test. 
    
	Ponting had also mentioned that he was unhappy with his conduct when he stayed put at the crease in the first innings after being given out. 
    
	Madugalle has been sent by the ICC with the purpose of getting the two warring captains together and help Match Referee Mike Procter. 
    
	By all accounts, the next three days in Perth in lead up to the Test are going to be pretty hectic. 
    
	Ponting has called for a meeting of his teammates and Kumble too has announced that he would let his boys know about the line they should not cross during the Perth Test.

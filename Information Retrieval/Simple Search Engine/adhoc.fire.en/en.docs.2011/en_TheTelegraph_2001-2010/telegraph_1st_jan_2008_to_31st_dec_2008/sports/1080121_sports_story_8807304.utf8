 Id expected Kumble to be a good captain and he hasnt disappointed: Barry Richards

	Perth: The legendary Barry Richards, who is Perth-based, spoke to The Telegraph on Sunday afternoon. 
       
	The following are excerpts: 
       
	On Team Indias headline-making performance at the Waca 
    
	Well, it showed that Australia is coming back to the pack... I dont wish to take anything away from the way India performed, but Australia havent got the replacements for Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath... Shaun Tait, for example, has much work to do. 
    
	On whether the Australians underestimated India 
    
	Dont think so... I doubt if the Australians will ever underestimate India. 
    
	On whether hed expected the Indians to bounce back after Sydney 
    
	The potential was there... It has always been in Indian cricket... If I may add, Greg Chappell must be a very happy man as hed been (MoM) Irfan Pathans strongest backer... The Indians have shown that if the ball swings, theyre in business big time... 
    
	On the turning point 
    
	Quite clearly the way the Indians bowled in the first innings... To bowl Australia out inside three sessions (for 212) was commendable. They made the ball talk by pitching it up... (Adds laughing) If Ive to come back as a cricketer in my next birth, it will be as a swing bowler... Not many swing the ball and Id get thousands of wickets... The last great swing bowler was Wasim Akram. 
    
	On whether he wouldve batted first even after packing the XI with three seamers 
    
	Looking at the wicket, yes... There was so much talk of pace and bounce, but from what Ive been told, it was quite evident on the first morning that it wouldnt be that quick... The pace and bounce stuff was only in the newspapers! The wicket behaved like an old motor car, functioning, but like one which was 20 years old... The old Waca wicket wouldve a glassy look. 
    
	On his standout memory of the Test 
    
	The Indians swing bowling... RP (Singh), Pathan, Ishant Sharma... 
    
	On Ishant 
    
	Has a lot of promise... Hes aggressive and has pace. 
    
	On Virender Sehwag making it back to the XI 
    
	Im very happy for him... Sehwag may not get you many runs, not that he cant, but he takes the attack to the opposition... He can, for example, use the pace of Brett Lee to good effect... And, if he gets at least a fifty, then the momentum is with India. 
    
	On Wasim Jaffer, who is struggling 
    
	Well, he cant be found wanting at this level and my advice is that he should look to bat time and not try and change his game... 
    
	On captain Anil Kumble getting loads of credit 
    
	Look hes respected by the opposition, by the seniors in his team and by the newcomers... Id expected him to be a good captain and he hasnt disappointed. 
    
	On whether he agrees with Ravi Shastri that Kumble shouldve got the captaincy two years ago 
    
	Why not? I suppose the issue then was just how long would he play... 
    
	On the India vs Australia rivalry 
    
	It wont be as big as the Ashes or India vs Pakistan, but could well be No.3. 
    
	Finally, on how he sees the fourth and final Test, in Adelaide 
    
	If the ball swings, India will have a good chance... I hope we dont get to see a flat wicket there.

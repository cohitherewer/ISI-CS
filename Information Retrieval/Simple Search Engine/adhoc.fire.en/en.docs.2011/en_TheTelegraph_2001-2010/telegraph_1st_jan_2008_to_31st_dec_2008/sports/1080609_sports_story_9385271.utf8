The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cristiano a world class talent, says Houllier
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cristiano a world class talent, says Houllier
                      
	Vienna: Cristiano Ronaldo has developed into a world class talent by simplifying his game, Uefa technical delegate Gerard Houllier said on Sunday.         
	The Portugal winger, still only 23, topped a remarkable season for Manchester United by scoring in their Champions League final win over Chelsea  his 42nd club goal of a season that earned him double player of the year awards for a second consecutive season.         
	Yet he arrived for Euro 2008 with some critics claiming he had yet to prove himself on the big stage. Houllier, however, who will analyse the tournament as part of Uefas technical team, was full of admiration.         
	In 2004 he was a very young player, now he has acquired experience through the Champions League and Premier League, the former France manager told a news conference on Sunday. He looked sometimes as if he was overdoing it but it looks now as if he has simplified his game.         
	The most difficult thing in football is to keep things simple and it seems that with maturity hes learned to do that and has become more and more effective for his team.         
	He can beat players, he can run, he can make goals, he can score. You have international players, then world class player and he definitely belongs among them.           (REUTERS)

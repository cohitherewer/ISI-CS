                                                   Indians not wary of SA
  - Rain threat looms large ahead of U-19 World Cup final in Kuala Lumpur       A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Kuala Lumpur: India are hoping to keep their winning run intact when they take on South Africa in the final of the U-19 World Cup on Sunday.         
	The Indians practised under lights on Saturday and coach Dav Whatmore has asked the players to treat it as just another match. The coach has asked us to be positive in our approach and treat it as just another match We are staying relaxed and not taking much pressure, said Sreevats Goswami.         
	The Indians, led by Virat Kohli, will be looking to play to their potential. Going by form and record, the Indians start favourites. The South Africans came last in a tri-series with India and Bangladesh late last year.         
	India beat South Africa by six wickets in a group league encounter earlier in the tournament.         
	The rain threat looms large. It remained cloudy the whole of Saturday and intermittent showers are forecast for Sunday. The day began with lashing rain  debunking the myth that it only comes down in the evening here.         
	South Africa went through to the final after defeating defending champions Pakistan by 98 runs. Two years ago, South Africas Under-19 team went to Sri Lanka full of hope and returned disappointed having first been dumped out of the group stage and then beaten in the Plate Championship by Nepal.         
	The transformation this team has undergone has been amazing. Under the watchful eyes of coach Ray Jennings, the Proteas are now a well-drilled and disciplined group of players who do the basics right. Besides good bowling and batting, their fielding has been exemplary. On Saturday they proved too much for a Pakistan team looking for a hattrick of victories in the World Cup.         
	The South Africans will be pinning their hopes on their captain Wayne Parnell who has already taken 16 wickets in five matches.         
	Sreevats was confident of repeating his semi-final performance. We are determined to return with the World Cup. Hopefully we can get things right.

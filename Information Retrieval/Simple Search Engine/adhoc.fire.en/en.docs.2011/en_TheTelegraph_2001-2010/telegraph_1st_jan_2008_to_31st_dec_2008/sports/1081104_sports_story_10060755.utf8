	Madrid: Real Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw at Almeria on Sunday, missing their chance to draw level on points with leaders Barcelona, while Sevilla threw away a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 at Real Valladolid.         
	Real looked to be closing in on a third successive Primera Liga win after Raul met Gonzalo Higuains cross with a diving header shortly before half-time that flew into the net past Almeria keeper Diego Alves. But with just under 10 minutes left, Pablo Piatti volleyed superbly past Iker Casillas for the equaliser.         
	Undefeated Villarreal are in second on 21 after their 4-1 win at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, the same score by which Barcelona won in Malaga.         
	Valencia suffered their first loss of the season on Saturday, losing 4-2 at home to Racing Santander.         
	Meanwhile in Milan, AC Milan went top of Serie A for the first time this season after an own goal from German Denis four minutes from time sealed a 1-0 home win over 10-man Napoli on Sunday.

	Fiorentina slipped back after allowing midfielder Houssine Kharja to head in a corner and give Siena a 1-0 win in the Tuscan derby on Sunday. (Reuters)

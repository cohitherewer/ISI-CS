The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dalmiya cynosure at Pawars dinner
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dalmiya cynosure at Pawars dinner
                  Jagmohan Dalmiya                     
	Jagmohan Dalmiya was still at the Mumbai airport when his cell rang, on Friday evening. The caller, believe it or not, was outgoing Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar.         
	You must come to the (pre-AGM) dinner, Pawar told Dalmiya, whose casting vote had denied him the presidentship in 2004. Dalmiya was reluctant, but changed his mind once Pawar extended the invitation a second time.         
	So, instead of heading for his hotel (Oberois Trident), Dalmiya went to the InterContinental. He spent around 20 minutes there and, with Pawar himself taking the lead, was warmly welcomed by almost everybody except perhaps by the secretary-designate, N. Srinivasan.         
	At one point, Pawar took Dalmiya aside and, then, asked Shashank Manohar (who will succeed him on Saturday) to come over as well.         
	Yes, it was a nice gesture on the part of the president... We spoke generally, about the academy which is to come up in Calcutta and whether the Eden had been denied an ODI against England... Manohar clarified it wasnt Calcuttas turn, Dalmiya stated when contacted by The Telegraph.         
	Nice gesture, yes, but hours earlier the Pawar group had selected Raja Venkat (a prominent member of the anti-Dalmiya camp back in the Cricket Association of Bengal) as the next senior selector from East...         
	Come Saturday and Dalmiya will attend his first BCCI meeting in 21 months. Specifically, hell be making a comeback after having been expelled (for reasons other than cricket) in December 2006.         
	As the head of an affiliated unit (Bengal), Dalmiyas most welcome... We dont wish to be uncivil, but therell be an appropriate response if he tries to raise something, somebody very influential in the ruling group had said before Dalmiyas arrival in the city.         
	Incidentally, Dalmiya has chosen not to stay at the Taj Mahal hotel, which is the official one for the BCCI in Mumbai.         
	Joint secretary Biswarup Dey is also around, gaining exposure which should come in handy at some stage.           LPS

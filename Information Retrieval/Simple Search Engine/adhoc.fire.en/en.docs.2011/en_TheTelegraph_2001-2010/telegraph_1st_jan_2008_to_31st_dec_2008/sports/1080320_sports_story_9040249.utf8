The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I want to be like Kapil: Praveen
                                                     I want to be like Kapil: Praveen
                  Praveen                     
	New Delhi: Praveen Kumar, who played a vital role in Indias tri-series win in Australia, has said he wants to be an iconic allrounder like Indias 1983 World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev.         
	I want to be a good allrounder like Kapil but I know I can never match what he achieved, the unassuming Praveen said on Wednesday.         
	I was in fifth standard when I found this broken wooden plank on the rooftop of my house. I had rupee one with me... I took along a cousin and got the plank moulded into a bat at a nearby carpenters shop, he recalled.         
	The Meerut player, who was sold for a whopping Rs 1.25 crore in the IPL bidding, played his first match for a prize money of a mere Rs two against a team from his own neighbourhood.         
	Our team won that match. We played two matches after that, Praveen said.                 (PTI)

	New Delhi: Terming Sourav Gangulys exit from international cricket as unfortunate and sad, former hockey skipper Dhanraj Pillay Friday said senior players in any sport deserved better treatment and respect from their countrymen.         
	Pillay was deeply hurt by the way Ganguly was treated as the episode reminded him of his own unceremonious exit from the Indian team.         
	I feel really hurt when a senior player is treated like this. It is unfortunate. We have given our heart and soul for the game. Dont we deserve a better farewell, said Pillay.         
	Senior player is next to coach. In our country people remember one bad performance and forget past nine good shows. They constantly criticise you. Same thing happened with me and now with Sourav.

	New Delhi: Sourav Gangulys participation has added a new dimension to the Ranji Trophy Plate group semi-final between Bengal and Goa at the Karnail Singh Stadium from Thursday.         
	The Bengal players arrived in the capital on Tuesday and will practice from Wednesday. Sourav is expected on Wednesday morning and will join the team at nets. Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla and coach Utpal Chatterjee visited the stadium on Tuesday afternoon and had a look at the wicket.         
	Things are fine here. We are confident of reaching the final, Chatterjee said.         
	The Indians Railways, who are the organisers of the match, has already made arrangements for extra security at the stadium from Wednesday.         
	We have our own security personnel at the stadium but since Ganguly will be playing, we have written to the local authorities to make adequate police arrangements, said Ashok Dewan, the former India hockey goalkeeper, who is in charge of the stadium.         
	We expect a decent crowd on all four days, Dewan said.

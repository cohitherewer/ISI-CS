The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians tied 10th
                                                                                                                                                                                           Indians tied 10th
                      
	Shenzhen: Ill at ease with the fearsome foursome format, the Indian duo of Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa brought home a level-par card to lie tied 10th in the Omega Mission Hills World Cup here on Friday.         
	Both Jeev and Jyoti had predicted that the going would be tough in this alternate shot format.         
	The duo, in fact, were under pressure after a poor start which saw them two-over before birdies on the seventh and ninth helped them go even-par.         
	The 11th hole birdie put them, for the first time, one-under but dropping a bogey on the 15th meant it was back to square one again as they fell 10 shots off the lead.         
	Indias two-day total of 139 has them at the 10th place which they share with the Philippines and with the fourball format returning for the third round on Saturday, both Jeev and Jyoti want to make amends to raise some sporting cheers back home.         
	We feel bad whats happened out there (in Mumbai). Obviously we have been watching the news quite a bit, said Jeev.         
	Jyoti was equally upset with the terror strikes and said, I did feel for the people that for no rhyme or reason got injured. It does affect us a little bit. But what can you do? Youre here to play and try to do the best you can.         
	Meanwhile, Spains Miguel Angel Jimenez and Pablo Larrazabal stormed to a four-shot lead after carding a remarkable nine-under-par 63 in the second round.         
	Playing the more difficult foursomes format, evergreen Jimenez and his European Rookie of the Year partner scored like it was fourballs, scooping eight birdies and an eagle with just one bogey to move to 17 under for the $5.5 million tournament.         
	I think at one moment that maybe we could break 60 the way we started, world No. 20 Jimenez said. We played very well. We complemented each other very well and enjoyed ourselves on the golf course.         
	Australians Richard Green and Brendan Jones also gelled well on the first day of alternate shot play, but will rue a bogey at the last which left them with a 68 and a share of second place with overnight leaders Germany.         
	The German pairing of Alex Cejka and Martin Kaymer had a couple of early bogeys to drop down the leaderboard but rallied with three birdies on a flawless back nine to stay in the hunt with a 69.

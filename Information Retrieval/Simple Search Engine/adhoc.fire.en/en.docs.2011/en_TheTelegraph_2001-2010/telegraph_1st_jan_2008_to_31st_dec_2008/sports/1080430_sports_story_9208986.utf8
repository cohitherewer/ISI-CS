                                                                                                                                                                                                     Im not taking the captaincy for granted, says Gayle
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL
  -   West Indies skipper reflects on leadership and on opening         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                          
	Calcutta: Chris Gayles groin injury has prevented him from taking the field in the Kolkata Knight Riders colours in the Indian Premier League. Its been a loss for the crowds but no less disappointed is the West Indies captain himself.         
	The other evening, the 28-year-old Gayle (a triple centurion in Tests) spoke to The Telegraph about captaincy and opening.                         Chris Gayle    
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether he has settled down as the West Indies captain         
	Seems that way I think Im coping with it well and have been getting a good response from the players Im trying to get the job done without losing focus on the brand of cricket that I play         
	Role model captain, if any         
	Not a role model but Ive admired Stephen Fleming He had a big hand in building this New Zealand team The Black Caps havent been the most talented but he would get the best out of his players There have been other captains too whom Ive liked to watch but Fleming was right at the top.         
	His style of captaincy         
	(Laughs) Im known to be an aggressive batsman but Im not aggressive in the dressing room Of course, Im serious about the job and Im not taking the captaincy for granted Ive tried my best to understand the players and vice-versa Thats how it works Its the understanding of each other which helps a team grow Where Im concerned, its an open floor at team meetings Anybody and everybody is welcome to offer suggestions A line of communication is always open It helps that Im friends with all the players.         
	The presence of senior-most pro and former captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the dressing room         
	Theres no problem with him Shiv has done wonders for West Indies cricket Hes a tremendous team man Hes our best batter and has been so consistent.         
	Whether hes felt the pressure of being the captain         
	More responsibility than more pressure I try and keep the expectations to one side when I take guard         
	Captaining a team which hasnt been doing well in recent times         
	Its not difficult, because I believe that we have talented players Captaincy, I suppose, could become difficult if you have a team packed with so-called superstars Were in the process of rebuilding and such a process starts from scratch Were looking to the future but I accept we need to be consistent.         
	His vision for West Indies cricket         
	One is aiming big but theres a process which has to be completed The next series, against Australia, is going to be a real test of character If were able to compete against them, then it could become the turning point for our cricket.         
	Twenty20 action         
	This form is terrific and, believe me, its drawing the crowds back to cricket matches in the West Indies The youngsters want to talk about Twenty20, nothing else The ultimate for us players, though, is Test cricket. Test cricket will still have supporters among the paying public.         
	Favourite batsmen         
	(Laughs again) Left-handers Brian Lara, Sourav Ganguly I like batsmen who attack, batters who have flair The flamboyant types         
	Qualities which a good opener should possess         
	Technique is important but the mindset is more important Opening isnt easy but youve got to back yourself Its a tricky position and the regular nightwatchmen wont be queuing up to open Thats for sure!         
	His top five openers         
	Sourav exclusively in ODIs The others would be (in random order) Matthew Hayden, Saeed Anwar, Virender Sehwag and Herschelle Gibbs All have or had a presence Could dominate at will.         
	Tips for young openers         
	The youngsters could get a little messed up and, so, its important to have the right mindset Important to be positive A few failures could tempt you to bat down the order but its important to stay strong Look to play in the V instead of trying for runs behind the stumps Remember, whatever the position, runs never come easy         
	Finally, whether hes conscious of records         
	To be honest, Ill need to check my stats to find out about records I didnt, for example, realise Id become the first to score a hundred in a Twenty20 International (117 in the inaugural World Twenty20 Championship match) I try and enjoy the game, rather than looking to create records. The enjoyment is necessary.

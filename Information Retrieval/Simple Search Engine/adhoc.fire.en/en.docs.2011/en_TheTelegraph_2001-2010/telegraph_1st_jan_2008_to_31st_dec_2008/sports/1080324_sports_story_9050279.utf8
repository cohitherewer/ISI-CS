The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kimi puts Ferrari on track
                                                   Kimi puts Ferrari on track
                      
	Sepang: Kimi Raikkonen cruised to victory in Malaysia on Sunday to put Ferrari back on the winning track and slash Lewis Hamiltons lead to three points.         
	World champion Raikkonen failed to finish last weekends season-opener in Australia but the Finn sealed his 16th Grand Prix victory when he took the lead from teammate Felipe Massa at the first set of pitstops.         
	BMW Saubers Robert Kubica finished second, the best result of the Poles Formula One career so far. McLarens Heikki Kovalainen was third with British teammate Hamilton having to settle for fifth.         
	Massas race came to an end on lap 31 when the Brazilian, who started on pole position with Raikkonen alongside on an all-Ferrari front row, spun out at turn eight and could not escape the gravel trap.         
	It was a pretty easy race from that first pitstop really, said Raikkonen. We had quite a difficult weekend in Australia and we were not 100 percent sure it was going to be any different here.         
	But everything worked perfectly. This is a good start to the season for us and were in a pretty good position, added the Finn, who scored a point in Australia after only seven cars were left running at the finish and one of those was disqualified.         
	Hamilton, who started ninth on the grid after he and Kovalainen collected five-place penalties for impeding rivals in qualifying, finished behind Italian Jarno Trulli, who took a fine fourth place for Toyota.         
	Nick Heidfeld (BMW), Mark Webber (Red Bull) and Spains double world champion Fernando Alonso (Renault) collected the rest of the points.         
	Force Indias Giancarlo Fisichella finished 12th while teammate Adrian Sutil retired with a hydraulic snag on the fifth lap.         
	Hamilton, who won in Melbourne, was fifth at the end of the first lap but could not find a way past Australian Webber.         
	Problems in removing the McLarens right front wheel at the first pitstop cost Hamilton 20 seconds and ultimately wrecked his chances of catching the leaders.         
	I was pushing Mark for a long, long time but being behind someone is extremely difficult so it doesnt matter how much quicker you are, it makes it extremely difficult to get past, said the 23-year-old. And then we were in with a good shot for third place and then we had the wheel gun at the pitstop.         
	Kubica savoured BMWs second runners-up spot in a row following Heidfelds superb finish at Albert Park last week, but said his team had to rein-in their expectations.         
	It was a fantastic result for the team, said the Pole. Hamilton leads the championship with 14 points after two races, ahead of Raikkonen and Heidfeld with 11.

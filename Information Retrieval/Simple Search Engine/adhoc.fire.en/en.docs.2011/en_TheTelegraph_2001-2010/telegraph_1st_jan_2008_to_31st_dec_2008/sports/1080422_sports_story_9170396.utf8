The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its chaos when SRK wants order and nothing less 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its chaos when SRK wants order and nothing less 
  - Ill be following whats being done at the Eden, says megastar       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan with Ishant Sharma during a promotional in the city                                 
	Calcutta: The more Shah Rukh Khan desires order, the more theres disorder.         
	Indeed, the chaos which greeted the megastar at different times during his day-and-a-half trip to the city, left him quite drained.         
	Disorder was on view during the Kolkata Knight Riders first home match, at the Eden on Sunday. It was pretty evident on Monday evening too, as Shah Rukh was leaving The Sonar.         
	First, Shah Rukh had to dodge past hysterical fans (most of them women, young and old). He did oblige some photograph-seekers, though.         
	Then, Shah Rukh had to admonish a securityman, who appeared to roughly push a group of photographers and hangers-on. No, not like that... Dont do that, he told the dazed plainclothesman.         
	Finally, Shah Rukh had to chide a couple of photographers who wanted to trample him and his son, Aryan. The latter, in fact, briefly lost his balance.         
	Theres a way of doing things, please... Dont shout and dont push, Shah Rukh said, as bodyguard Yasin reminded him that he was well behind time in leaving for the airport and catching the flight back to Mumbai.         
	Earlier, Shah Rukh laughed when a suggestion was made that he needed a break after a truly hectic week, a feature of which was hours of dancing at the Chinnaswamy and at the Eden in dehydrating conditions.         
	In a few days, Ill be off to Paris for the unveiling of my wax statue at the Gevin Museum there... Before that, there are other commitments to keep, Shah Rukh told The Telegraph.         
	He added: But Ill be following whats being done at the Eden... Ive set out to improve things when the next match is played there (versus Mumbai, on April 29)... As Ive said, I want the whole experience to be nicer...         
	Its no secret, of course, that Shah Rukh swears by quality. Brand SRK simply cannot be associated with anything thats mediocre or worse.         
	Kudos to Shah Rukh for being sensitive towards the needs of those who pay good money for a seat, but that also reflects so poorly on those running the Cricket Association of Bengal.         
	Shah Rukh, understandably, chose to steer clear of the more contentious issues. For example, whether curator Kalyan Mitra should be sacked and whether hed himself taken the initiative for an SOS to the Adelaide Ovals legendary Les Burdett.         
	Not being a naam ke vaste owner of the Knight Riders, on the way out, Shah Rukh spent almost half-an-hour with his team which was engaged in a promotional shoot on the hotel premises itself.         
	I had to say goodbye, he remarked, grinning in his trademark manner.

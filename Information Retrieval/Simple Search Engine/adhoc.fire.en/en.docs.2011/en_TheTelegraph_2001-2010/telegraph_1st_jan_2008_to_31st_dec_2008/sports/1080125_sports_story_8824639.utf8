	Adelaide: The Adelaide Oval curator, Les Burdett, who is an authority on wickets, has been invited by the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) to visit Mohali before the season ends. 
    
	Wed like Burdett to review everything and, if needed, suggest ways in which we can get better... Also, during his stay, we could organise a seminar for the curators from the zone, PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra told The Telegraph. 
    
	Bindra, a former Board president, is here for the final Test.

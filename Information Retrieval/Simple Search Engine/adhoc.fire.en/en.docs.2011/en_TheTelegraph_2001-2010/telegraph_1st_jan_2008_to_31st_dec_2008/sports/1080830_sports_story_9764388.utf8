The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | HIGHLIGHTS
                                                                                                                                                                                                     HIGHLIGHTS
                      
	 The unbeaten 94-run stand between Jehan Mubarak and Thilan Thushara is the best for the seventh wicket at this ground, bettering 84 (also unbeaten) between Mohammed Kaif and Anil Kumble against Zimbabwe in 2002. Sri Lankas previous best was the unbeaten 52 between Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Dharmasena against England in 2001.         
	 Thilan Thusharas performance with the bat (168 runs) and the ball (10 wickets) in this series was the second best by a Sri Lankan allrounder. Sanath Jayasuriyas performance (321 runs and 10 wickets) in the 10 matches of the 2003 World Cup remains the best for Sri Lanka. However, Thusharas performance is the best by a Sri Lankan in a bilateral series.         
	 Ajantha Mendiss wicket of Yuvraj Singh was his 30th in this calendar year. This makes him the top wicket-taker in 2008. He went past the tally of Australian Nathan Bracken, who has taken 29 wickets so far.         
	 This is Indias lowest total in Sri Lanka. Their previous lowest was 127 against New Zealand also at the Premadasa Stadium, in 2001.         
	MOHANDAS MENON

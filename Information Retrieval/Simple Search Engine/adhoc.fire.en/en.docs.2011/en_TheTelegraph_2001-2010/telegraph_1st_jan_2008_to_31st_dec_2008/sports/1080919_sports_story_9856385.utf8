            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sambaran Banerjee is likely to be the chairman of the state senior selection committee, after Gopal Bose declined to accept the post.         
	Incidentally, Bose is in the running for being the East Zones representative on the national selection committee.         
	According to sources, Bose turned down the offer from the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), citing personal reasons.         
	The CAB working committee will meet on Friday to decide the names of Bengals senior and junior teams selectors. Kalyan Chowdhury, Saradindu Mukherjee and Barun Burman are likely to continue on the senior panel.         
	The new formats of the Challenger and the A.N. Ghosh trophy will also be finalised in the meeting.         
	Other issues to be addressed are the conversion of the sub-junior tournaments from the point format to age groups, CAB membership and the IPL accounts.         
	The womens cricket sub-committee is also likely to be formed.

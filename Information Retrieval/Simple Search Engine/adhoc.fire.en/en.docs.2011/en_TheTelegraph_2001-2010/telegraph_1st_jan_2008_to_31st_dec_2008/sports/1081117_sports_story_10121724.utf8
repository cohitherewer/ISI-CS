The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant out, decision on Yuvraj today
                                                                                                                                                                                             Ishant out, decision on Yuvraj today
            A CORRESPONDENT    
	Indore: Ishant Sharma has been virtually ruled out of the second one-day International against England here on Monday, while a final call on Yuvraj Singhs fitness will be taken on the morning of the match.         
	Ishant missed the first match too, following an ankle sprain sustained in the fourth and final Test against Australia in Nagpur.         
	Ishant is virtually out of the match because, if he doesnt play here, it will give him five-seven days time to recover, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Sunday.         
	Yuvraj was adjudged Man of the Match for his scintillating knock of 138 off 78 balls in Indias 158-run victory in Rajkot. But he injured his back during the course of that innings and needed a runner. Though Yuvrajs MRI scan showed no damage, the lefthander is still not feeling comfortable.         
	Dhoni said there was considerable improvement in Yuvrajs condition but India would take a final call on him before the match.         
	England, on the other hand, have to battle their low morale after the thrashing they received at the hands of the marauding Yuvraj.         
	Captain Kevin Pietersen, however, said his team would bounce back and come hard at India in the second clash. But that looks easier said than done against an in-form Indian team.         
	Unless England find a way to arrest their alarming slide, they are in danger of being steam-rolled by Dhonis boys.         
	England coach Peter Moores wants his team to be more aggressive. We thought we were a bit tentative in the way we played (in Rajkot) and could have been more aggressive in everything we did, Moores said.         
	I think we can be more aggressive as a unit and not wait for the game to take shape. We have to remind ourselves how we play our brand of cricket and play that brand of cricket in different places.         
	We played some really good one-day cricket towards the end of our English summer against South Africa and we want to make sure we go out and back ourselves to play that sort of cricket out here in India  the conditions are slightly different, but its still a 50-over game and simple basics still apply.         
	The captain who wins the toss is likely to bat first. The wicket will not be like the one at Rajkot, Dhoni said. There will be wear and tear as the match progresses. Its dry and it will become slow and it will be difficult to score.         
	Paul Collingwood agreed, saying that the pitch was flat and had some cracks. Curator Samundar Singh Chauhan, however, was of the opinion that the toss wouldnt be that significant. You can see a score in excess of 300 being scored and maybe even being chased. The wicket is hard and will last 100 overs.         
	Collingwood said that Ryan Sidebottom, the left-arm medium-pacer, was fully fit to play after missing the opener in Rajkot due to an Achilles tendon. If England pick Sidebottom, he is likely to replace James Anderson, who conceded 52 in eight overs.         
	This is the first series under the new playing conditions, which allows the batting side to decide when to take one Power Play (five overs), and Dhoni said that the change made the game more interesting. India took their Power Play after the 34th over in Rajkot and scored 41 off it.         
	Its quite early to say (how it affects the outcome of a match), Dhoni said. One has to have a few options to deal with it. Generally the batting team decides to take it soon after the change of ball (after 34 overs). It depends on what sort of start the team gets.         
	TEAMS         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, RP Singh, Munaf Patel.         
	England (likely): Matt Prior, Ian Bell, Owais Shah, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff, Paul Collingwood, Ravi Bopara, Samit Patel, Stuart Broad, Ryan Sidebottom, Steve Harmison.         
	Umpires: Russel Tiffin and Amish Saheba. TV: Suresh Shastri.         
	Match Referee: Roshan Mahanama.           HIGHS AND LOWS

    - Duo rewarded for being consistent in domestic cricket             A STAFF REPORTER            Selection committee chairman K. Srikkanth during the meeting in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                 
	Calcutta: Tamil Nadu batsman Subramaniam Badrinath and Haryana leg-spinner Amit Mishra are the two new faces in the 15-member squad for the first two Tests against Australia.         
	The squad consists of seven batsmen, one wicketkeeper, four fast bowlers and three spinners.         
	Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman and Badrinath are the batsmen with Mahendra Singh Dhoni as wicketkeeper. Dinesh Karthik and Parthiv Patel, the two wicketkeepers picked for the Sri Lanka tour after Dhoni opted out, have been excluded. Rohit Sharma and Pragyan Ojha have also been dropped from the squad which went to Lanka.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth, the new chairman of selectors, was confident the team would perform to expectations. This is the best team according to us, Srikkanth said after the meeting in Mumbai.         
	Badrinath made his ODI debut in Sri Lanka in August, and Mishra played three ODIs back in 2003 in Dhaka. That Mishra was in the running for the third spinners slot was reported in The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	A right-hand middle-order batsman and occasional off-spinner, Badrinath has been the mainstay of Tamil Nadu batting in the domestic circuit. Having made his first-class debut in 2000-01, he has so far scored 4638 runs in 66 matches at an average of 55.21. In 2007, he scored consistently for India A on their tours to Zimbabwe and Kenya, and in the home series against South Africa A.         
	Badrinath had been named as Sachins replacement for the ODIs in Sri Lanka, and playe            d three games. Dhoni, his captain for the ODIs, publicly expressed satisfaction with Badrinaths attitude during the series. He, however, managed only 92 runs in the recent A series against Australia and New Zealand and had a poor Irani Cup.         
	Mishra, who has 294 first-class wickets in 76 matches at 25.17, had a fine domestic season (38 wickets in the Ranji Trophy).         
	The 25-year-old leg-spinner from Haryana made his first-class debut in 2000-01 . Mishra was called into the India squad for the home series against the West Indies in October 2002, but did not get a chance.         
	He played three one-day matches in the TVS Cup in Dhaka in April 2003 when some of the seniors were rested after the World Cup in South Africa.         
	Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma will lead the pace attack along with Munaf Patel and Rudra Pratap Singh. The Uttar Pradesh pacer got included because the selectors decided to pick a 15-member squad.         
	The first Test will be played in Bangalore from October 9, and the second in Mohali from October 17.

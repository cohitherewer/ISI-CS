The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Houghton wants to meet the coaches 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Houghton wants to meet the coaches 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  Bob Houghton		    
	New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton, whose recent comments on former national coach Syed Nayeemuddin has created quite a stir, has requested the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to call a meeting with all I-League team coaches in Hyderabad.         
	Confirming this, the AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco told The Telegraph that he would try to arrange the meeting after the Indian team return from their 12-day training-cum-exposure trip of Portugal. India are scheduled to play a friendly match against Malaysia in Hyderabad on July 22.         
	The eight-team AFC Challenge Cup will be played at the same venue from July 30 to August 10. He would also like them to watch the practice of the Indian team on the eve of an important tournament like the AFC Challenge Cup.         
	Last season, Houghton called for a similar meeting in Gurgaon, which was attended by club coaches like Sukhwinder Singh, Subroto Bhattacharya and Bimal Ghosh.         
	Dempo coach Armando Colaco, however, remained a notable absentee. Houghton is of the view that it is impossible to improve the standard of Indian football without the help of the club coaches.         
	The top footballers stay with the national team for only three months. For the rest of the nine months of the year, they remain with their respective club teams, he said.         
	When I was coaching Swedish side Malmo in the 70s, Sweden made the final rounds of the World Cup, and I received a congratulatory note from the national team coach. There were only two players from Malmo in the Swedish national team but the chief coach was happy that the two were in top class physical condition, Houghton said.         
	But with many club coaches in India feeling upset about Houghtons remarks on a senior pro like Nayeemuddin, it remains to be seen how successful the Hyderabad meetings turns out to be.

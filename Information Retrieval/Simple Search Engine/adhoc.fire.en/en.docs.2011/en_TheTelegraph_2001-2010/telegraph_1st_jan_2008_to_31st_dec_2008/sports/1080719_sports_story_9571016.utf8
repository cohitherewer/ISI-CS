	New Delhi: Beijing-bound Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal received a moral booster just before the Olympics as she moved up two rungs to 16th in the latest world rankings, released by the International Badminton Federation (IBF).         
	Saina, who is the only woman shuttler from India to book an Olympics berth, improved her ranking with 38531 points in her kitty, according to the IBF table released on Thursday.         
	The 17-year-old earlier figured among the top 20 for the first time, when she was perched on the 18th spot jumping from 21 in the previous ranking, after the Asian Circuit last month.         
	In mens rankings, Anup Sridhar improved his position by one rung to 30th with 32212 points, while Chetan Anand and Arvind Bhat were ranked 37 and 42 respectively.           (PTI)

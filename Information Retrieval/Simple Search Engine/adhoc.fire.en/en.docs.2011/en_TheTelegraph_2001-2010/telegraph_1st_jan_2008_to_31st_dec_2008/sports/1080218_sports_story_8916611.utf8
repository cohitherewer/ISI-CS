                                                   We can beat them all: Carvalho
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: National hockey coach Joaquim Carvalho is confident that the current squad has the ability to better every opposition in the Olympic qualifiers in Santiago, Chile, beginning March 1.         
	I am keeping a close watch on my wards but Im not too worried. I know they will deliver the goods at the right time, Carvalho told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	India face a grim battle in Santiago. Under the new rule only the winners will qualify for Beijing. Hosts Chile, Great Britain, Austria, Mexico and Russia are the other teams in the fray.         
	According to Carvalho, the recent tour of Australia  where India played half a dozen practice matches  had lent the team much confidence.         
	The stint in Perth was very useful, he said.         
	We played a few tough matches and won all except one against Western Australia. The Australian side was as good as any. We could have won but rank bad umpiring let us down. Even the spectators were booing the umpires.         
	In the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, India lost to China and failed to reach the final for the first time. In Perth, we played against China twice and won both times, said Carvalho.         
	The coach isnt ready to reveal his final squad though he has submitted his list with the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF).         
	Sources said that drag flicker Sandeep Singh, who was never considered among Carvalhos favourites, might make a comeback because of pressure from the top brass. The Indian team leaves for Santiago on February 25.

            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shaun Marsh                           
	Calcutta: Back in Perth, Geoff Marsh has reasons to celebrate.         
	First, son Shaun got picked for the ODIs in the West Indies. Then, the 24-year-old has been making a huge impact for Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Im definitely very pleased... I havent watched all of Shauns matches, but have certainly seen some of them, Geoff told The Telegraph on Sunday afternoon.         
	Hes a former Australia opener, (1999) World Cup-winning coach and a one-time national selector.         
	Geoff added: Shaun largely went over to gain experience and to enjoy himself... His provincial coach, Tom (Moody, of Western Australia) is the Kings XI coach and, so, that probably helped him settle down quickly...         
	Asked whether being his son put Shaun under more pressure, Geoff replied laughing: I dont think he thinks of the family name... Thats not the way it is with him... Hell be judged by how he performs.         
	Shaun has been communicating with his father once in a while. My message to him has been simple  just enjoy the IPL experience... Nothing more, really... Shauns been playing with and against some great players, Geoff pointed out.         
	The Kings XI captain, Yuvraj Singh, is one of those to be impressed by Shaun. Indeed, he sees a bright future for the left-hander (Geoff, incidentally, was right-handed).

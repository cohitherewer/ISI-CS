	Mohali: International Cricket Councils (ICC) principal adviser Inderjit Singh Bindra on Sunday admitted that Test cricket was getting badly affected by the dwindling popularity of the five-day version of the game and stressed on the need to channelise the Twenty20 interest into Test cricket.         
	Addressing the media on the sidelines of the India-Australia Test here, Bindra, who is also the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) president, said that associations all over India need to set up more international centres to rotate the matches.         
	We are badly affected by the low presence The crowd present at the ground makes all the difference. There is no atmosphere without the crowd.         
	We are taking it very seriously and lot of research is on to find out the solution, he said.         
	We are planning to set up two more international centres at Bhatinda and Jalandhar to rotate the matches. Were definitely concerned with the problem.         
	Bindra blamed too much cricket in the last couple of years in Mohali for the low turn-out during the ongoing Test.         
	During the IPL matches we had 86 per cent occupancy in seven matches.         
	We need to create more facilities and improve amenities for the crowd. We have to make the stadiums more spectator-friendly, he said.         
	The PCA president also informed that the Indian cricket board has decided to ask the member organisations to set up more than one centre.         
	Bindra refused to comment on the ongoing feud between the Indian Premier League and the rebel Indian Cricket League, saying that ICC CEO Haroon Lorgat was handling the issue.

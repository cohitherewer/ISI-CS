                                                  Jeev seeks good putting week

	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh believes he is striking the ball pretty well and all he needs now is a good putting week to finish atop the leaderboard of the Indian Masters.         
	Talking as he prepares to swing his club for the first European Tour event in the country, Jeev insisted putting would hold the key when the $2.5 million tournament tees off at the Delhi Golf Club (DGC) here on Thursday.         
	I think it all comes down to putting for the four days, he said. Im striking the ball really well, and hopefully it would be a good putting week for me, Jeev said.         
	The seasoned Indian also sees a limited role for the driver on a course where aggression never paid any dividends.         
	The way I play on this course, I use the driver maybe twice if I am comfortable with it. Otherwise, its three-wood or a lot of irons off the tees.         
	It depends on individuals. Some like to be aggressive. But my experience says DGC always bites you whenever you tend to be aggressive. The conservative way is the three-wood and irons and I would take that conservative route, he said.         
	On the relaid DGC, Jeev said players couldnt afford to be impatient. Its a very demanding course. You have to be patient here. You have to plan a lot of your shots, especially off the tee.         
	You have to keep the ball in play off the tee. If you can do that, rest is quite simple. Off the tee is the key to leave yourself with a better chance of making birdies.         
	Though Jeev believes the depth of the field makes it anybodys chance, he feels local knowledge would give an edge to the Indians. It does give you an advantage if you have played here. Specially the way this course is set up, I think there is an obvious advantage for us.         
	But the field, especially the European Tour has a lot of depth, a lot of good players and anybody can win it this week. A lot can happen on Sunday, he said.         
	Though the field boasts of names like Ernie Els, Thomas Bjorn, David Howell and Darren Clarke, Jeev did not hide his wish to see an Indian lifting the title.         
	European Tour coming to India is a great news and if an Indian goes on to win the title, it would be the icing on cake, he said.         
	Buoyant after his top 20 finish in Dubai Desert Classic, Jeev looks forward to shrug off the disappointment of last year and play in the Majors.         
	This year, maybe its going to be the European Tour and depending on it if Im back among the top 50 in the world then I would play the Majors and the WGC events, he said.         
	Asked about his pal Daniel Chopra, who honed his basics at DGC but is not in the field for Indian Masters, Jeev said, every professional golfer had his commitments.         
	I am very proud of the guy. He has gone through some tough things in life and struggled with his game. But I am proud for what he has done. He is going to do even better in the coming years, he said of the Indian-born Swede, who won his second PGA Tour title in the Mercedes-Benz Championship.

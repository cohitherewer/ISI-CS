            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Ascriptive had no peers to match his talent in the 2,000m Calcutta Monsoon Derby which the 18-10 favourite claimed to the delight of a sizeable Sunday crowd. The Chevalier-Ivyanna son was ridden well off the pace but woke up to the task at hand when jockey C. Alford alerted trainer Vijay Singhs new acquisition  from I. Saits stable  halfway through the slated trip. Once in the motion, Ascriptive grew stronger with every stride. The favourite did face some resistance from the Trial Stakes winner, Bountiful Talent, but it turned to be a routine challenge nearly a furlong from the winning post.          
	Safari, who had won the fillies version of the Trial in a common canter, was no match for the masculine powers. The China Visit daughter was a faraway third, and struggled to beat Apollotina and Arktouros  an additional entry at the cost of Rs 3.6 lakh. The winner took home a rich purse of about Rs 16.5 lakh. Incidentally, the day belonged to Alford who scored quadruple of wins.

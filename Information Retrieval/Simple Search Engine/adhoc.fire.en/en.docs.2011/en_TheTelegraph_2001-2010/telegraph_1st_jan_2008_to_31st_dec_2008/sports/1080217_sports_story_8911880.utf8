The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chowrasia: Success, which hasnt come easy, wont go to my head
                                                   Chowrasia: Success, which hasnt come easy, wont go to my head
  - On those who influenced him the most, his early years and more         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                            
	Calcutta: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia isnt the first caddie-turned-pro to make it big and the hope is that he wont be the last. The 29-year-old Chowrasia (now ranked 161 in the world), though, will remain very special for Calcuttans. The other morning, he spent time with The Telegraph at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC).               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Biggest influence         
	My mother, Srikumari... More than my father (Ganesh Prasad), shes the one who encouraged me at every step... She had immense faith in me... Its not that my father didnt want me to take up something Id become passionate about, but hed always ask wheres the money?... He was, I suppose, being practical.         
	The importance of money         
	Money is important and I wouldnt like to waste any of it... Accha investment karna hai (with the over Rs 1.6 crore won at the Indian Masters)... Ill also have to help out with youngest sister Ritas wedding... My schedule is coming in the way of her marriage... Baat chal rahi hai... Sportsmen have a shelf life and, so, one needs to prepare for life after golf or cricket or soccer... Ive had this habit of saving and remember having saved Rs 4,000-5,000 from earnings as a caddie. I would keep the money with mother.         
	[As there are precedents, an appeal is being made for a tax exemption. Hopefully, Chowrasia wont have to part with a chunk of his earnings.]         
	Whether he has an object of desire         
	(Laughs) well, Im fond of bikes... I have a Pulsar, but have been absolutely fascinated by a Yamaha which is in Jyoti Randhawas garage... Its a beauty.         
	On whether hes either gifted himself or his mother something after becoming the Indian Master         
	Not yet, but Ill certainly get something for her and my father (both of whom are in Gauspur village, some three hours from Varanasi)... Kuch to zaroor dena padega, but I dont think I can meet them for two-three months... Ill be busy with back-to-back tournaments in Delhi and will then head for Malaysia and Korea.         
	The golfer who made the earliest impression         
	Basad Ali... His putting, among other things, would be brilliant.         
	Starting off as a caddie at the RCGC         
	Thats how I began to learn more about golf... Im particularly indebted to Mr Neil Law, the first member for whom I began to caddy, and who supported me in a big way... Im also grateful to Mr Madan Singh (a former RCGC captain, now settled in Jodhpur)... In fact, there were times when I took two-three months fees in advance from Mr Singh... Id become his caddie after Mr Law stopped playing... The RCGC has, of course, backed me throughout... Unka haath hamesha raha hai.         
	The early years         
	(Laughs again) I used to be a big fan of Ajay Devgun and would run off to watch his movies... Main jyada door nahin jaata tha, usually to the Malancha or Navina theatres... Occasionally, to Menoka... Going to a theatre close to the RCGC helped me return home quicker! People at home would be under the impression I was on the golf course.         
	Favourite actors         
	Early on, it was Devgun... Over the years, Ive grown to admire Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan... Aishwarya, Priyanka Chopra... I dont get the time to see many movies, the last I watched in a theatre was Bhool Bhulaiyaa... (After a pause) There have been times on the Tour when Ive watched DVDs brought by Gaurav Ghei...         
	Music         
	Helps me relax... I find the songs of Veer Zaara haunting.         
	Other forms of relaxation         
	Sleeping... Some yoga...         
	On having much in common with Indias ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (who too is fond of bikes and finds sleep an excellent way to relax)         
	Didnt know that... Hes making a big name for himself... Sadly, I dont get to watch much cricket as its time consuming... If Ive got to watch a match, then Ive got to see it from the first ball till the last... Thats too many hours.         
	Whether hes God-fearing         
	Its not that Im afraid, but I have lots of faith... I dont need to fear God as Im confident I wont do anything to earn his wrath...         
	Destiny         
	Woh to hai hi... I mean, my father couldve worked anywhere and not at the RCGC and, then, I wouldnt be talking to you... Destiny has made this happen. Theres somebody much bigger who makes things happen.         
	Whether hes superstitious         
	Oh, no... I wont stop dead in my tracks if a cat crosses my path nor will I wear the same T-shirt just because I had a good round the day I wore it. I keep things simple.         
	First tournament outside Calcutta         
	Patna, in 1997... Outside India, it was Macau in 2006.         
	Worst moment         
	Not signing the card in Taiwan, after leading in the first two rounds... That disqualification was painful, but Ghei and Rahil Gangjee helped me overcome that setback... I followed their advice that I shouldnt brood over what had happened, but look ahead... Im thankful for the moral support they extended.         
	Best moment         
	The Masters win, till I got the RCGCs honorary membership (on Thursday).         
	The No.1 challenge         
	(Laughs once more) Right now, its finding time to practise.         
	Handling pressure         
	Its best to stay relaxed and control things I can control... Faltu mein tension lene se kya fyada?         
	Getting ready to bump into Tiger Woods         
	Absolutely... Id like to know how he keeps his nerve in the final rounds... Ill make sure Ive got a camera in hand! Woh tasveer to special rahegi.         
	On the person that he is         
	Main kya boolun? I know my strengths and weaknesses... I dont like talking much... I try not to do anything which would be seen as wrong... Im always conscious of that... I like the company of friends and quite like non-vegetarian food... Dont know how else to answer your question...         
	Finally, whether at some point, fame could change the simple person that he is         
	That wont happen... Jaisa hoon, waisa hi rahoonga... The media has been after me, ever since I landed on Monday morning, but Ive found the time to be with friends... Success, which hasnt come easy, wont go to my head.

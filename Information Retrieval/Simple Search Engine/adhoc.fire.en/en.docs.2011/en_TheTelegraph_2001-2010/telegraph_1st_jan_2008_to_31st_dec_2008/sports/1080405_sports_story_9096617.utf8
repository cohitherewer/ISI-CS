                                                     Not the same Chelsea: Kezman
            John Ley in Istanbul            Action during the Chelsea-Fenerbahce match on Wednesday                           
	The Chelsea team were already on their way to the airport on Wednesday night as Istanbul began its vibrant celebrations of Fenerbahces remarkable 2-1 Champions League victory and a former striker offered a damning indictment of Avram Grants reign at Stamford Bridge.         
	Serbian striker Mateja Kezman had one season at Chelsea, under Jose Mourinho, and claimed the team he left was stronger than the one beaten here. Chelsea without Mourinho is not the same, he said. Under him, they were a machine, working without mistake or any faults. Now they have ups and downs, and you can see them. Theres not the same spirit in the team any more. Its not the machine it used to be.         
	You can see that something is not working. If [Frank] Lampard goes out of the game after 75 minutes, something is wrong. Maybe its good for us because it gives us the chance to go to the semi-final.         
	The experienced player offered no excuses for Grants first European defeat. Michael Ballack said: It was our fault. We controlled the game. We had everything in our hands but we didnt concentrate for every second. Thats our fault but we have another game and we should win it at home.         
	Chelsea led with an own goal from Fenerbahces Deivid, but former Brighton and Sheffield United striker Colin Kazim-Richards replied and Deivid made amends with a wonder strike.         
	Until half-time, everybody thought it should be, not an easy win, but a win for us, Ballack said. We had two or three good chances to score another goal and we didnt, and thats the Champions League. You have to concentrate for 90 minutes. If for one second you are not concentrated you concede a goal and the game changes.         
	Kazim-Richards looked shocked as he considered his achievement. I want to get to the final of the Champions League. The atmosphere was unbelievable. They are the best fans in the world and Im sure the world will see more at Stamford Bridge as there are a lot of Turkish people in England.

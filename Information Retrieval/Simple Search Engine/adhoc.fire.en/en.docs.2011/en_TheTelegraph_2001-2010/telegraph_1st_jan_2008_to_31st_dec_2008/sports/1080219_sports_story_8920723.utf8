The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AS Roma look to check slide
                                                     AS Roma look to check slide
                  Captain Tottis poor form is a worry for AS Roma                     
	Rome: AS Roma are seeking to bury a dip in form that may prove fatal to their domestic title hopes when they face Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie on Tuesday.         
	Second-placed Roma lost 0-1 at Juventus on Saturday, their trademark slick, fast passing game nowhere to be seen, as they fell to their second consecutive away defeat to drop 11 points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan.         
	Coach Luciano Spalletti will be particularly worried about captain Francesco Tottis lack of venom.         
	Hampered by nagging back and ankle problems, last seasons European Golden Boot winner has not been on target since netting his 200th goal for the club in an Italian Cup tie a month ago.         
	Spallettis options up front may be limited because Tottis understudy, Montenegro forward Mirko Vucinic, is a doubt for the game at Romes Stadio Olimpico with a thigh strain.         
	Tuesdays menu is, however, delicious with Serie A champions Inter Milan, 11 clear at the top this season, visiting 2005 winners Liverpool, who lost 1-2 to second tier Barnsley in the FA Cup on Saturday, while Chelseas more direct approach takes them to Olympiakos Piraeus. 2004 champions Porto visit Schalke 04, Germanys last remaining hope.         
	Against Roma, injury-hit Real also have form problems.         
	The Spanish champions suffered their second defeat in three league games when they surrendered an early lead to lose 1-2 at Real Betis on Saturday, although they still enjoy a comfortable five-point lead over Barcelona at the top of the table.         
	With defenders Pepe, Gabriel Heinze and Christoph Metzelder all missing, Reals weakness in the air was exposed in both goals which came within four minutes from almost identical far post headers.         
	But Spalletti found no encouragement from this.         
	I know that Real Madrid lost, but Im not rejoicing, he told reporters after Saturdays game in Turin. Im happy when I win, not when others lose. Whats more, Betis scored with headers, while we are good at playing with the ball on the ground.         
	Heinze is back in the squad for the clash at a ground where Real have never lost, but Brazilian fullback Marcelo, Pepe and Metzelder are definitely out.         
	In-form Brazilian forward Robinho, Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder and Argentine striker Javier Saviola will also be missing through injury.         
	Striker Ruud van Nistelrooy returned to action as a second-half substitute after missing last weeks 7-0 win over Valladolid and will be ready to start in Rome, while fellow Dutchman Arjen Robben looks to have put his injury worries behind him.         
	Chelsea head to Athens with midfielder Frank Lampard and captain John Terry recovered from long-term injuries. Both played in the 3-1 FA Cup win over Huddersfield on Saturday, with Lampard scoring two goals and setting up the third.         
	They deserve to be the heroes of the club because of what they give to the team, Chelsea manager Avram Grant said.         
	Grant warned Chelsea not to be complacent about the Greek champions.         
	You may think this looks easy on paper, but it could be very difficult, Grant said. We must not underestimate Olympiakos and their supporters are fanatical for the team.         
	Olympiakos coach Takis Lemonis has all his players fit for the match and is ready to prove his side deserves to be at this stage of the competition.         
	Chelsea are not the most spectacular team in Europe, truth be told, but they are strong in every aspect and very tough to beat, Lemonis said. Chelsea are favourites, of course, but we are determined to put up a fight.

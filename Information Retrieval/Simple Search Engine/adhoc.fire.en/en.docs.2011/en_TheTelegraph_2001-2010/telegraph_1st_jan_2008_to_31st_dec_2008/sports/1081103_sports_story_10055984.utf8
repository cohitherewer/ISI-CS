	New Delhi: Thokchom Nanao Singh continued his blazing form and stunned Cadet World Championship bronze medallist Grigoriy Nikolaychuk of Russia 15-5 to clinch the gold at the inaugural AIBA Youth World Boxing Championships in Guadalajara, Mexico.         
	The light fly-weight Army boxer ended up being Indias lone medallist in the event, where the team finished ninth overall with 15 points. Despite being tied on points with 10th-placed Uzbekistan, India finished ahead of the Central Asian country due to a slightly better points-per-boxer average of 2.1.

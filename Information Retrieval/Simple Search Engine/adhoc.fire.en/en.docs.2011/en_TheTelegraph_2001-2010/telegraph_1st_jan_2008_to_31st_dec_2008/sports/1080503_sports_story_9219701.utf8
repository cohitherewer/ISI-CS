The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Challengers rely on Misbah
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Challengers rely on Misbah
                      
	Bangalore: Languishing at the bottom half of the table with a string of defeats, Bangalore Royal Challengers will have to quickly find a winning combination as they take on an equally struggling Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League here on Saturday.         
	Both the teams have managed only one win and that too against the same team  Mumbai Indians.         
	With their tottering top order becoming a matter of concern, the Royal Challengers will rely a lot on Pakistans Misbah-ul Haq, who replace Ross Taylor, to strengthen the batting line-up.         
	Jacques Kallis, who hit a blistering fifty in their last match, has to ensure that he continues to contribute with both bat and bowl, while skipper Rahul Dravid also has to prove a point.         
	The visitors will have to ensure that Adam Gilchrist and Herschelle Gibbs fire on all cylinders, with some firework from out-of-form Pakistani Shahid Afridi and Rohit Sharma.

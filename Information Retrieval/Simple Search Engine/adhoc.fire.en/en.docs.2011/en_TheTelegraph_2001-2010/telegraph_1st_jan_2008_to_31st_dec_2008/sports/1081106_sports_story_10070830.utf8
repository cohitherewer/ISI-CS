The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We (Fab Four) admire each other silently: Laxman
                                                                                                                                                                                                       We (Fab Four) admire each other silently: Laxman
    - A Telegraph Special Middle-order gem looks ahead to his 100th Test           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            V.V.S. Laxman                                 
	Nagpur: Come Thursday and Vangipurappu Venkata Sai Laxman will be playing his 100th Test. On Wednesday evening, the 34-year-old spoke to The Telegraph in his room at the Pride Hotel.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q Is there much excitement, being just hours away from your 100th Test?         
	A Theres much satisfaction, not excitement... Theres no question of getting carried away and Ill be remaining normal... Emotions arent there in my thinking and Ill be treating the Test like any other in the past... I do realise its a very important one as a win will give us the series.         
	But few get this far...         
	Whats really satisfying is that, coming from a family of doctors and engineers, Ive managed to make a career in cricket... At the age of 17, Id given myself five years to make it, otherwise I wouldve quit and concentrated on academics... As it so happened, I made my Test debut (against South Africa in Motera, 1996-97) just a few days after turning 22... Im thankful to my parents (V. Shantaram and V. Satyabama) for not forcing me to concentrate on academics and to an uncle who noticed my talent in cricket.         
	Is there somebody youll be remembering more than the others once your 100th Test gets under way?         
	Look, Im grateful to a whole lot of people each time that I play a Test... So, in that regard, the 100th Test wont be any different... Im not going to get distracted because its a milestone-Test.         
	What were your thoughts when you made your debut?         
	There was a great sense of pride in wearing the India cap and thats something I havent forgotten.         
	How would you have reacted had somebody then told you that youd be playing 100 Tests?         
	(Laughs) Wouldve said I hope so!                     
	Are you in the habit of setting targets? Did you list a goal then?         
	I do set targets, but not in numbers... Obviously, I wanted to play for as long as possible and to make a significant contribution... You cant, on your debut, say youve set out to play an X number of Tests or that you intend to score an X number of hundreds... You cant, after all, take into account the many factors that will come into play. You cant factor in the downs which are bound to be there in ones career... The way I see it, you shouldve short-term goals and once you start achieving them, the bigger ones will, step by step, be realised.         
	With Sourav Ganguly set to retire, the end of the Nagpur Test will also signal the end of an awesome combination  the Fab Four. Has that been at the back of your mind?         
	Its sad when you know that somebody from the family wont be there again... The last India innings will definitely be emotional... In our own way, each one of us has contributed to Indian cricket... Weve helped take it to the next level and its with pride that I say were now much better travellers... (After a pause) We, the Fab Four, admire each other in a silent manner... This is a time to celebrate everything weve done for Indian cricket.         
	[The Fab Four have featured in 79 Tests, with 25 of those ending in wins. As for the remaining Tests, statistics show 27 draws and as many losses.]         
	Where would you place Souravs contribution?         
	It was under Souravs captaincy and when John (Wright) was the coach that I re-emerged as a batsman... The team too went from strength to strength 2000-01 onwards... Sourav and John changed the teams thinking and we became more confident... Souravs contribution as captain wont be forgotten... He backed match-winners... As a batsman, well, he has been a great performer... Anybody with over 7,000 Test runs and over 11,000 runs in ODIs has to fall in that category.         
	Youve authored some really big innings. How do you judge your own performances?         
	The innings which have helped the team win are the ones which have given most satisfaction... Also, the innings which have come in pressure situations... I value them very highly.         
	A point didnt have to be proved, yet you did make a statement with the excellent double hundred (200 not out) at the Kotla last week...         
	Im quite used to people having negative things to say... The first four years of my career had been very tough as I was in and out of the team, was made to open, then sent back to the middle-order... Generally, I stay focused on the job and dont concern myself with whats being said or written... Theres no point trying to control things which cant be controlled... Id be concerned if my teammates werent happy with me, for that would mean something is wrong. Its important for me to have the respect of the dressing room.         
	Weve been talking of Test cricket, but you must be disappointed that your ODI career has ended abruptly?         
	Yes, I got dropped when I was batting well... I felt I could contribute, but others didnt think that way... For a while, I was upset, but realised that I shouldnt allow that exclusion to affect my Test cricket.         
	You arent emotional, but given the significance of the occasion, who will you be dedicating your 100th Test appearance to?         
	A lot of people... Family, dear friends, coaches, teammates... Its a long list. I dont forget people whove helped me.         
	The final one: Wife Sailaja, who is a regular companion, isnt around...         
	(Smiles) Shes expecting our second child (son Sarvajit is 22 months old) next month and cant travel... My parents, though, will be at the ground. Old friends too.

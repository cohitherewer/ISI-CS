	 Akmal out of Asia Cup probables  
	Karachi: Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmals luck finally ran out on Thursday when the national selection committee axed him from the Asia Cup squad and brought in young Sarfraz Ahmed. With Sarfraz the only keeper named in a short list of 20 probables for a two-day conditioning camp here, it was obvious that Kamran had lost the confidence of the selectors. Selectors said a final 15- member squad would be named on Sunday. Kamrans omission came after he played virtually non-stop for Pakistan in 38 Tests and 88 one-day Internationals since replacing Moin Khan in 2004.  
	PROBABLES         
	Shoaib Malik (C), Nasir Jamshed, Salman Butt, Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf, Sarfraz Ahmed, Shahid Afridi, Fawad Alam, Sohail Tanvir, Bazid Khan, Yasir Hameed, Misbah-ul-Haq, Sohail Khan, Umar Gul, Rao Iftikhar, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Mansoor Amjad, Naumanullah and Asad Rauf.   
	Jamie hopeful  
	 Dhaka: Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons is hopeful his players can harness their individual skills to recapture their World Cup form in the Asia Cup starting in Pakistan next week. Bangladesh have failed to win a match against a major side since they reached the Super Eight stage in West Indies last year, knocking former champions India out in the process. The players havent done it yet, Siddons told a news conference in Dhaka on Thursday, referring to his teams inconsistency. I am hoping that this tournament (Asia Cup) will be where we do that.  
	Appointments  
	 Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced the appointments for upcoming ODIs to be played between Canada and Bermuda from June 28, says A Staff Reporter. According to an ICC release, Gary Baxter from the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires and Roger Dill from the ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel will be the on-field umpires for those matches. Chris Broad of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees will oversee all matches.  
	Haddin call  
	 Melbourne: Clearly in two minds on whether to tour a volatile Pakistan for the Champions Trophy, Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin leaves it on Cricket Australia (CA) to take the final call on the issue.         
	Though the International Cricket Council (ICC) is insisting that Pakistan is safe enough to host the elite event, Australian cricketers are quite apprehensive about the security scenario there. Haddin, who toured Pakistan as captain of the Australian A team in 2005, says he would trust CA.   
	Veto power  
	 Durban: Cricket South Africa (CSA) president Norman Arendse lost his veto power as South Africa made a complete overhaul of their selection policy in the wake of its controversial transformation policy. CSA has accepted most of the recommendations made by the transformation review committee and accordingly, Arendse would no longer enjoy the veto power.

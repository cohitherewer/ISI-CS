                                                   Rain threat again over Gabba tie

 - Yuvraj Singh to undergo fitness test before start of play 
   A CORRESPONDENT
              
	Brisbane: Indias young batsmen will have to prove their mettle as they take on Sri Lanka in the second match of the tri-series on Tuesday. 
    
	In the previous two games  the Twenty20 and ODI against Australia  the batsmen came a cropper. Many of them who had joined after the Test series are yet to come to terms with the conditions Down Under and will have to work hard to get their act right on a pacy Gabba track. 
    
	The Indians had opted to leave out seniors to shape a team for the future but the move has not paid dividends yet with the youngsters being unable to make much of an impression. 
    
	The visitors were bundled out for 74 in the Twenty20 International in Melbourne and their batting left much to be desired in the tri-series opener before rain came down. There has been no let up in the weather since. It rained almost the whole of Monday and the forecast for Tuesday is also discouraging. The Indians were forced to practise indoors. 
    
	Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma failed to build on their starts in the last match but others such as Robin Uthappa and Manoj Tiwary were a disappointment. The batting will get a boost if Yuvraj Singh is available. 
    
	India, on paper, bat way down the order which could actually improve if Yuvraj is available. The Team India vice-captain batted at nets on Monday. He will undergo a fitness test on Tuesday before the start. Physio John Gloster will have the final say on his availability. 
    
	A member of the team management said: Its one thing to bat at nets and quite another to be an active participant in a match situation. He showed no discomfort but we will need to see how he shapes up with fielding drills on Tuesday. 
    
	If Yuvraj does play, Manoj Tiwary will have to sit out. As of Monday evening, no other changes were being contemplated.

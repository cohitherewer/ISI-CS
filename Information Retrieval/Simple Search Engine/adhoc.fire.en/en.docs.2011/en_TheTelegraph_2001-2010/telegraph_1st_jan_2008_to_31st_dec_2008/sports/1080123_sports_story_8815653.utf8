                                                   Vengsarkar defends choice

           
	Pune: Unfazed by the criticism over the one-day squad sans Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid in some quarters, BCCI chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar has strongly defended the choice of players for the ODI tri-series in Australia. 
    
	We have to look ahead. What is the point in picking up some players whose career would last just a couple more years?, Vengsarkar, who was here for a function, told reporters on Monday night. 
    
	I may or may not remain the selector. But we have to build up the team for the future and we have opted for the best blend of players in the current tour, Vengsarkar said. 
    
	He refrained from making any comment on the exclusion of former captains Sourav or Dravid. 
    
	The chairman of the selection committee had earlier told a TV channel: When we took it (selection) in our hands, we were No. 7 in the rankings. 
    
	Now we are No. 2 and we hope that we will be No. 1 very soon not only in Tests but even in ODIs.

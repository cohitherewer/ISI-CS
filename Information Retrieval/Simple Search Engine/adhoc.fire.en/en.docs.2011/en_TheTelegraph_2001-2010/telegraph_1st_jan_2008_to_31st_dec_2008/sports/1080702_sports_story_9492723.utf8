The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NP Pradeep plans stint in Europe
                                                                                                                                                                                                       NP Pradeep plans stint in Europe
  - For me, sky is the limit, says midfielder       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Pradeep                                 
	New Delhi: For someone who was forced to sell his sisters gold chain to buy his first pair of boots, it is never easy to dream of playing professional football in Europe.         
	But N.P. Pradeep, undoubtedly the star-in-waiting in Indian football, is made of different stuff. Born in a poor family in Thodupuzha in Keralas Idukki district, Pradeep has never allowed his ambition to shrink.         
	For me, the sky is the limit, the 25-year-old central midfielder, who holds an amazing scoring record (10 goals in 25 matches) for the national team, told The Telegraph.         
	Nobody knows the value of money better than me, said Pradeep, who has reportedly signed with East Bengal for an astronomical sum. East Bengal is only a stopover... I am looking for bigger things.         
	I am planning to go to Europe next season, said Pradeep. I have a few contacts in Cyprus, who are trying to get me there as a professional footballer.         
	I would have gone this season itself, but the seven-month lay-off after I got injured in the Durand Cup semi-final cost me dear. Next season I should be ready.         
	Meanwhile, a club in Maldives had asked me to play for them. They were offering me good money, too. But I rejected the offer because I wanted to play at a better place and improve my game.         
	What is most amazing about Indias most wanted player at the moment is his remarkable level of confidence. Asked how he managed to score so many goals for India in such a short period, he smiled and said, more goals should be coming from my boots this season.         
	Scoring is not a problem, said Pradeep nonchalantly. Steven (Dias) and Rennedy (Singh) bhai supply a lot of passes from the wings.         
	And we get regular chances to score. Because of their absence, we could not win the SAFF Cup final in Colombo.         
	A graduate from the Annamalai University, Pradeep hasnt heard about Yousuf Khan and was surprised to know that he was being compared with the former great for his ability to play in all positions.         
	I dont know how versatile I am but I can play in all positions, he said. I started as a striker and played in that position for the India Under-19 team. Akhmedov, the team coach, then used me as a left half and I was equally comfortable. I even played as wing back against Saudi Arabia after Prashant Jaggi was shown the red card.         
	My father worked as a loader in a wood cutting company, Pradeep added. He died last year. I want my sisters to grow up. And I, if you ask me, grew up watching (Jo Paul) Ancheri bhai.         
	He even played as a goalkeeper in a match for FC Kochin. I wish I had a left foot like him. (I.M.) Vijayan bhai will set up the ball with his magical dribbles and Ancheri bhai will finish in a flash... No goalkeeper can stop it. I want to score like that.

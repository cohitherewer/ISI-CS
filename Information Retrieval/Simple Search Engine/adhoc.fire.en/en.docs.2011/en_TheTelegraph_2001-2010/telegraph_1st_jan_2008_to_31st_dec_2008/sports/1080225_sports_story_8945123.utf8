The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fabiano family robbed
                                                     Fabiano family robbed
                              
	Madrid: Sevilla striker Luis Fabianos family was robbed at gunpoint at home last Friday, manager Manolo Jimenez said. This happened just a day after goalkeeper Andres Palop had his house burgled.         
	Speaking to reporters after Saturdays 5-0 win over Real Zaragoza, Jimenez said Brazilian Fabiano had been at training during the robbery while Palop and his family had been asleep when they were burgled.         
	The robberies have been another obstacle the side have had to overcome. The squad have come together, talked a lot, and we dedicate the win to our families, in particular Luiss, Sevilla coach Jimenez said.         
	The incident did not appear to distract Fabiano on the pitch and the Primera Ligas leading scorer took his tally for the season to 19 with two goals against Zaragoza, who finished with 10 men.         
	It was one of our best games this season, said Palop.         
	Two own-goals and a header from Seydou Keita completed the victory.         
	Sevilla, who lost 3-2 away to Fenerbahce in their Champions League last 16 tie during the week, climbed to fifth in the standings.

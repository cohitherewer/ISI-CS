	Wellington: England paceman James Anderson registered his fourth five-wicket haul to put his side in control of the second Test against New Zealand at the end of Day II on Friday.         
	England, courtesy Andersons five for 73, bowled the hosts out for 198 late on the second day at the Basin Reserve, giving the tourists a 144-run first-innings lead.         
	England reached four without loss at stumps on Friday, a lead of 148 with three days remaining. Openers Alastair Cook (2) and captain Michael Vaughan (0) safely negotiated a tricky five-over spell.         
	Ross Taylor top-scored with 54 and Daniel Vettori contributed 50 not out in New Zealands first innings, while Paul Collingwood chipped in with career-best figures of three for 23 for England.         
	New Zealand had bowled England out for 342 just before lunch after wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Ambrose had scored his maiden Test century.         
	A 71-run partnership between Stephen Fleming and Taylor and a brutal 52-run stand from Brendon McCullum and Vettori were the only bright spots of a poor batting display from the hosts.         
	Fleming, who became the 32nd player to pass 7,000 Test runs when he moved to 18, and Taylor took their side through to 100 for three at tea but Fleming fell soon afterwards.

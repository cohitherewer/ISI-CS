                                                                                                                                                                                                     We are part of a family: Harbhajan 
                      
	Chandigarh: Mumbai Indians stand-in captain Harbhajan Singh on Saturday downplayed the controversy regarding him allegedly slapping Sreesanth to bring the Kings XI Punjab pacer to tears, saying the issue had been sorted out.         
	Harbhajan allegedly hit Sreesanth after the Punjab team won against Mumbai Indians in their Indian Premier League encounter late on Friday at Mohali but he later apologised to the pacer in the dressing room of the home team.         
	A lot of things happen in a family. We are part of a family.         
	A lot of things are coming out in the media but whatever happened has happened and we have sorted it out Everything is fine now, Harbhajan said before leaving for Mumbai with his team on Saturday morning.         
	Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar, who is yet to play an IPL match because of a groin injury, refused to talk about the issue.         
	I dont want to talk about it, he said.         
	Sreesanth, on his part, also said everything was normal between him and Harbhajan.         
	Everything is normal, there is nothing between us, he said.         
	Harbhajan had allegedly slapped Sreesanth when the paceman said something to him which the off-spinner found offensive. The Kerala mediumpacer was seen crying bitterly on the ground at the end of the match, which his team won by 66 runs.

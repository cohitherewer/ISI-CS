The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangladesh dominate
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bangladesh dominate
                      
	Chittagong: Shakib al Hasan hit a maiden half-century after taking seven wickets to guide Bangladesh to 184 for eight and a lead of 258 over New Zealand at close on Day III of the first Test on Sunday.         
	Left-arm spinner Shakib took seven for 36 as Bangladesh bundled out the Black Caps for 171 in their first innings.         
	Shakib then hit a career-best 71 before becoming one of New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettoris four victims.         
	Shakib hit 12 boundaries, including three consecutive fours from one Jeetan Patel over, in his 151-ball knock before he was caught at second slip by Ross Taylor.         
	Earlier, Shakib completed the best bowling figures by a Bangladeshi in a Test innings to help give the hosts a 74-run lead in the morning session on the third day.         
	Its a great feeling when you bowl well, bat and field well and give as much support as you can to your team.         
	I am very happy, a delighted Shakib told reporters on Sunday.         
	New Zealand resumed on 155 for nine but Shakib bowled Iain Brien (15) in his second over of the day.         
	Bangladesh then slumped to 71 for five, with only opener Tamim Iqbal (33) getting a start before he was caught and bowled by Vettori.         
	Mushfiqur Rahim steadied the ship before he was out after tea for 32, bowled by Brien.                 (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India plagued by problem of plenty 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Team India plagued by problem of plenty 
    - Dhonis Boys enjoy psychological advantage             INDRANIL MAJUMDAR      TRI-SERIES FINAL vs PAK            Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and his Indian counterpart Mahendra Singh Dhoni with the tri-series trophy in Dhaka on Friday. (AFP)                                 
	Dhaka: Call it the after-effect of the Indian Premier League (IPL) or blame it on the Euro Championship, an India-Pakistan final hasnt proved to be the right formula to attract the people of this city. If the Kitply Cup was supposed to be the yardstick of survival for one-day cricket post IPL, and the easy availability of tickets is any indication, the verdict remains tantalisingly balanced on either side.         
	Almost a fortnight after the IPL ended, Yusuf Pathan and Manpreet Singh Gony still remain the biggest attractions here. The hero-status they are currently enjoying can only be compared to the popularity of a Sachin Tendulkar or a Sourav Ganguly in these parts.         
	Pakistans abject surrender in the league match against their arch-rivals, coupled with the Indians clinical display have only lent credence to the notion that Shoaib Maliks team dont have it in them to battle it out from a tight situation. That Mahendra Singh Dhonis youth brigade is far superior and enjoy the psychological advantage when pitted against Pakistan, is the common belief.         
	Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Nasim Ashrafs leaked email asking the team management to explain the reasons behind the disastrous show has added some spice to the proceedings, and the die-hard Pakistan fan is only hoping that it brings out the best in the players performance.         
	If the happenings managed to cause a stir in the rank and file coach Geoff Lawson remained unperturbed.         
	The Pakistan coach still seems to be basking in the glory of the undefeated 12-match stint  the majority of which have come against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh  and preferred to look at the positives from the last game.         
	However hard Lawson might try to defend his team, the fact remains that the Indian openers ominous form has put him in a quandary. The inconsistency in their bowling has been brutally exposed. No wonder, the coach paid special attention on the bowlers during the match-eve nets.         
	Despite pressure to play spinning allrounder Fawad Alam, Pakistan may persist with four fast bowlers. Alam hasnt made much of an impact in his limited exposure at the international level and might not be risked in the final.         
	The Indians are not taking things for granted.         
	The team had optional nets on Friday, and barring Suresh Raina, Robin Uthappa, Ishant Sharma, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Pragyan Ojha and Gony, the rest enjoyed an off day.         
	Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir may have made it look easy for India with partnerships of 155 and 85 in the tournament so far, but the middle and lower order havent been tested to the hilt. Gary Kirsten, though, was confident that the remaining batsmen would deliver if the need arises.         
	Were not expecting things The nature of the game is such that we may lose a wicket early tomorrow (Saturday). But weve got others in the side who can carry on the good work, the coach said.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni was also optimistic. Theres no extra pressure We will take it as just another match. The boys are experienced enough and the aim will be to keep the winning momentum going, the captain said.         
	Dhoni has to deal with a problem of plenty when it comes to selection. With Rudra Pratap Singh  who replaced Ishant  coming good with the ball on Thursday, he has a tough task in hand. Indications are that Ishant will be preferred ahead of the Uttar Pradesh pacer. Praveen Kumar has already made his mark with the ability to move the ball both ways and another incisive spell from him could spell Pakistans doom yet again.         
	While history favours Pakistan  who have won five of the seven tournaments when the two sides met in the final, the last of those in 1999  current form keeps India ahead. The jadoo may have gone out of the India-Pakistan matches, as Shahid Afridi put it, because of its frequency, but the intensity is never to be missed. Its about performing on the given day and neither history nor form holds true.

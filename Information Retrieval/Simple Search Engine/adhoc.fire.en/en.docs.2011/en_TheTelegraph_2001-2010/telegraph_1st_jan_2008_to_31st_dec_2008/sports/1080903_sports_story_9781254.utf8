                              GUEST COLUMN    Geoffrey Boycott      
	The great charm of sport is that everything can change so quickly. Earlier in the summer, people were asking me how England could beat the Aussies in 2009. With great difficulty, I answered.         
	At that stage, Andrew Flintoff was injured, Michael Vaughan couldnt buy a run and Steve Harmison was still best remembered for bowling the ball to second slip. Now, suddenly, there is hope. If England can keep everyone fit, they might be able to give the Australians a real run for their money next summer.         
	It is true that England have won only one dead Test and a few one-dayers against a South African team who are desperate to get on the plane home. And, yes, there is an element of England being flattered by some under-motivated opposition.         
	But there is no mistaking the value of genuine pace, whether over 20 overs, 50 overs or five days. With Flintoff and Harmison approaching the form they showed in 2005, England are sure to be a challenging proposition in any form of the game. If the Champions Trophy was being played next week, I would have had a few bob on them winning that.         
	The first step to recovery was appointing Kevin Pietersen as captain. I advocated that should have happened a year ago, when they gave the one-day job to Paul Collingwood instead. My reason was that Pietersen is self-confident and self-assured, his own man with his own views and his own way of doing things.         
	My impression of Pietersen is that he gets on with people but he also maintains a certain distance, which is a good thing as captain. Sometimes you have to make strong decisions that certain players will not like. One of Vaughans problems was that he got very close to Collingwood, among others, which made it difficult for him to stand back and make impartial judgements.         
	As for the argument that captaincy will affect Pietersens batting, I just cannot see him letting that happen. He is determined that at the end of his career he will be recognised as a great player, which is a great incentive. Of course, the job brings extra responsibilities, and a captain must keep an eye on the other players, but he should also be selfish enough to put his own game first.         
	In fact, captaincy might just make Pietersen an even better player. He has always been outrageously brilliant, but with a self-destruct button  which means he plays a stupid shot that gets him out. If the extra responsibility means we see less of that, it will be brilliant for England.         
	The biggest boost for Pietersen is Flintoffs return to form  especially with the bat. I cant remember him ever bowling poorly for England, but his batting comes and goes depending on his frame of mind. At the moment, he seems to be playing proper innings, rather than trying to slog. He doesnt have to hit the ball in the air to score quickly; his power is just as effective when he keeps it on the deck.         
	I like the theory of using Flintoff and Harmison as first and second change bowlers. Normally a batting side will feel that when the first-change bowlers come on there will be more balls to hit. But what you get with England is genuine pace.         
	With the new ball, James Anderson has bowled very straight. Stuart Broad has responded well to the responsibility; and in the middle of the innings, left-armer Samit Patel is a real find.

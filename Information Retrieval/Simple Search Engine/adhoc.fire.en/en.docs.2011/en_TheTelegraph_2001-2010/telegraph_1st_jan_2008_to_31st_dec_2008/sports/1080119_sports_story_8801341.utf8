      STAR RACER
                  
	Calcutta: Saturdays massive card may provide a lot of action. Fields are big and one may look forward to intense competition in most of the nine events on the cards. The packed fields may also serve a warning to the premium turf centres in the country that the RCTC is out of the woods. And in months to follow it may also gain the top spot which it lost years ago owing to various reasons. New horses and trainers from the other centres are willing to migrate here. The club is all geared up for such a situation. Race days may also be increased.
     
	The afternoons main event  the Calcutta Champions Sprint Trophy  is 14-horse strong. It also represents 10 different owners from across the country. Another good sign. Nevertheless, trainer Vijay Singhs ward, Elusive Study, is expected to win the trophy, defying all logic.

	New York: Second seed Jelena Jankovic survived yet another testing encounter to reach the quarter finals of the US Open on Sunday, beating Danish teenager Caroline Wozniacki 3-6 6-2 6-1.         
	The Serbian, pushed hard in her previous two matches, again became embroiled in a war of attrition but her superior fitness and strength proved key as she rallied for victory.         
	Jankovic is slated to meet either French 12th seed Marion Bartoli or 29th seed Sybille Bammer of Austria in the quarter final tie.         
	Mens fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko continued his smooth ride through the tournament with a 6-2 7-6 6-3 third-round win over fellow Russian Dmitry Tursunov.         
	The 26th seeded Tursunov stretched him to a tiebreak in the second but Davydenko won it 7-3. He claimed an early break in the third to go 3-1 ahead and closed it off efficiently.         
	Davydenko, a semi-finalist in New York for the last two years, could run into four-times champion Roger Federer in the quarter finals.         
	The Russian will next face either Nicolas Almagro of Spain or Gilles Muller of Luxembourg.         
	Among Saturdays results Japanese outsider Kei Nishikori stole the spotlight on yet another day of shocks, while Venus and Serena Williams rolled towards a quarter final showdown at Flushing Meadows.         
	Fourth seed David Ferrer was left a punched out wreck as he went down 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 5-7 following an inspired performance by Nishikori.         
	He will next face rising Argentine Juan Martin Del Potro, who tamed French 16th seed Gilles Simon 6-4, 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.         
	Rafael Nadal can expect an easy ride into the semi-finals after his draw opened up following the defeats of seventh seed David Nalbandian, ninth seed James Blake and 14th seed Ivo Karlovic.         
	Argentinas Nalbandian was ousted by 32nd seeded Frenchman Gael Monfils 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 and hard-serving Karlovic was beaten 6-7, 6-7, 2-6 by American Sam Querrey.         
	Mardy Fish completed a bad night for the seeds when he trampled over fellow American Blake 6-3, 6-3, 7-6.         
	Fish made clear he meant business from the start, breaking Blakes serve in the first game. In the second set, he broke early again to take a 3-1 lead and Blake struggled to find his rhythm.         
	Blake started the third set serving well but stuttered again at 2-2, when Fish chased the ball down before trapping Blake at the net with a delectable lob on break point.         
	Serving for the match at 5-4, Fish registered two double faults and sent the ball into the net on break point to allow Blake back in the match.         
	In the tiebreak, however, Blake missed several groundstrokes and Fish closed it out 7-4. Andy Murray, the British sixth seed, also looked to be on his way out when he was two points from defeat before he found his range to pull off a 6-7, 4-6, 7-6, 6-1, 6-3 win over Austrian Juergen Melzer.         
	World number one and Wimbledon champion Nadal, who will not face a top 30 player until at least the semi-finals, blasted into the fourth round by grinding down Serbian Viktor Troicki 6-4, 6-3, 6-0.         
	Venus Williams overwhelmed Ukrainian Alona Bondarenko 6-2, 6-1, while younger sister Serena blew past Japans Ai Sugiyama with an identical scoreline.         
	The 28-year-old, who will next face Polish ninth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, said she has added a little spice to her game since arriving at Flushing Meadows a decade ago.         
	Serena admitted she was disappointed at the prospect of playing Venus in the quarters and not further down the road.         
	But Ive had over a week to think about it. So right now Im just hoping to win my next match, said Serena, whose next test will be against Severine Bremond of France.         
	Four of the top 10 seeds on the womens side have fallen, clearing the way for one of the Williamses to make another title run.         
	Serena refused to say she was at the top of her game but she appeared close to it during her 66-minute demolition of Sugiyama, where she never faced a break point.         
	Dinara Safina, tipped by many as a potential champion here, almost became another big-name casualty before scrapping to a 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 win over Swiss teenager Timea Bacsinszky.         
	Former world number one Amelie Mauresmo reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time in over a year when she won 6-4, 6-4 against Julie Coin, the 188th-ranked Frenchwoman who had earlier stunned top seed Ana Ivanovic.

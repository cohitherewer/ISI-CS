            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The India under-16 football team started their training-cum-exposure tour of the US with a resounding 6-1 win over Metro F.C. Rapids-Dayton, Ohio, at Charleston, West Virginia, on Sunday.         
	The Indians are preparing to play the final rounds of the Asian championships to be held in October.         
	According to information received here, around thousand fans turned out to watch the Indians at Schoenbaum Stadium in Coonskin Park.         
	After an hour of play, the match was halted for 40 minutes because of lightning and heavy rain.         
	The teams were levelled 1-1 after the first 10 minutes when Raegan Albarnas cancelled the lead taken by India, through Biru Yadav.         
	The Indians went ahead in the 21st minute through Akshay Mall. Manandeep Singh made it 3-1 before the half time with a fine long ranger.         
	Malasawmfela then struck twice in the 49th and 76th minute. Bikramjit Singh rounded off the tally with a shot from the top of the box.         
	Their size caused problems, admitted India Coach Colin Toal after the match. They are a good club.         
	We are here just to improve. Our goal is when we leave on the 26th we are a better team than when we arrived.

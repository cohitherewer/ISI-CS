The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hussey bats for Tait
                                                Hussey bats for Tait
            SHARP SINGLES - Down under                
	Australias middle order mainstay Michael Hussey believes troubled paceman Shaun Tait can shake off the demons which have temporarily derailed his international career and return to the national team a stronger and better person and player.         
	I dont know what it was like in eras past but I do think it is very tough sometimes and a lot tougher than people think, Hussey was quoted as saying in The Australian.         
	What I have learnt and experienced in my time in the Australian team is that life as an international cricketer includes so many things. The playing of the game, which is hard enough itself, is actually just one small part of playing for Australia.         
	Whenever you notice someone battling you try to pick them up or take them out for a nice meal or something. With Shaun we didnt pick up on much. Im sure Shaun will find a way through it and come out the other end a stronger and better person.         
	BCCI message         
	 Australian players are at a risk of losing their lucrative IPL contracts with BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi declaring that Cricket Australia (CA) was sabotaging the futures of Ricky Pontings team. The divisive issue is that CA wants promotion of its sponsors during the IPL, a notion that the BCCI has rejected. If they want to keep playing these games, they can keep their players and we will have the IPL without them, Modi was quoted as saying in Sydney Morning Herald.         
	Players want hike         
	 Staking a bigger slice of CAs monetary pie, Australian cricketers now want a hike in their share of revenue by negotiating a new arrangement.         
	CA, till recently, said it was not willing to change the current system of Test and first-class players receiving 25 per cent of its revenue but top cricketers are pressing for a hike in their share. Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) chief executive Paul Marsh said:I think the players have shown over a long period of time they have been responsible. But the game is obviously very healthy financially at the moment, he was quoted as saying by The Daily Telegraph.

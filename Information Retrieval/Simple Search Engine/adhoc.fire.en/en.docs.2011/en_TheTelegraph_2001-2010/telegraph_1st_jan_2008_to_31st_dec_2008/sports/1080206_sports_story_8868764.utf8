The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdevs chances bright
                                                  Somdevs chances bright
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Somdev                           
	New Delhi: Impressed by Somdev Dev Varmans game, Indian captain Leander Paes said on Tuesday that the youngster might make his Davis Cup debut in the tie against Uzbekistan.         
	Somdevs chances of playing the singles further brightened after Prakash Amritraj complained of stomach upset. The California-based player, who missed the training session on Monday, could join the nets only for a short period on Tuesday.         
	Paes said he was convinced by Somdevs adaptability to grass courts. I am surprised to see his ability to adapt. Though he plays most of his tennis on indoors in the US, he is an all court player, he said.         
	Both Somdev and Mahesh Bhupathi joined the Indian team on Monday night. Somdev arrived from the US where he was busy playing for his University of Virginia team.         
	Rohan (Bopanna) is undoubtedly our spearhead as he is enjoying a good run. His outing at the Hopman Cup was excellent. But we are keeping our options open for the second singles, Paes said.         
	Former Davis Cup captain Naresh Kumar also sounded happy after watching the youngster. Somdev has got his basics right. He has solid ground stokes, he said.         
	Somdev, however, said he was keeping fingers crossed about making his Davis Cup debut.         
	Rohan, Prakash and I all have been playing well and the best two will play against Uzbekistan, Somdev added.

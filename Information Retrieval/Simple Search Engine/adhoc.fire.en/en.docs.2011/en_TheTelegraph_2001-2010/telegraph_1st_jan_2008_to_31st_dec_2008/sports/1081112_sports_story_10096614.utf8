The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cole happy to have lived the dream
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cole happy to have lived the dream

	Andrew Cole announced his retirement on Monday. A miserable November day, in an upstairs room at the offices of his management company, was not the time nor the place that one of the best centre forwards of his generation had hoped to call time on a distinguished career. When Cole signed for Nottingham Forest, he dreamt of going out in a blaze of glory, of shooting his home-town club back into the Premier League.         
	Instead, a glittering career ended in tears. Cole, 37, made an acrimonious departure from Forest 11 days ago and on Monday spoke for the first time. Cole voiced regrets at his lack of opportunities at the City Ground, at the mixed messages from Colin Calderwood, the clubs manager, and at the inevitable whispering campaign that followed his exit. But he came across like a man who had been relieved of a burden.         
	Characterised, by his own admission, as narky, sullen and unapproachable, the former Newcastle United, Manchester United and England forward was at peace with himself, if not with Calderwood, as he contemplated his first steps as a coach or manager.         
	Its not the ideal ending, Cole said of his exit from Forest, his contract having been cancelled by mutual consent after he failed to score in 11 appearances for the club. It just wasnt working out. I told them from the outset that I didnt want to go there to sit on the bench because I didnt want to be perceived as sitting back and making easy money. I wanted to go there and offer something, but it was a strange one from the start.         
	I never knew what my role was. Was it to lend a hand, use my experience, or was it a PR thing, to sell a few more season tickets? I still dont know. I felt like the manager wouldnt have a conversation with me. I dont know if its the right word, but he seemed kind of intimidated by me.         
	I wanted it to work out, but I was playing for 60 minutes and then getting taken off. Or sometimes I wasnt getting picked at all. After a game at Preston, I said to myself: You dont play, then they give you an hour, then you get taken off. Is it really worth it? That was in September. I told him [Calderwood] then that I wanted to go and that I would serve three months notice if they wanted me to, which was in my contract. He said no, give it another month, which I was prepared to do, and then suddenly, a few weeks later, the club start putting it around that theyve sacked me or that Ive walked out.         
	People will look at it and say this is how they expected me to go, in a huff or in some kind of controversy, but it wasnt like that. I just wish Forest could have been honest. Ive always been honest in my career, maybe too honest for my own good.         
	That honesty extends to an admission that he was too hasty in leaving Manchester United for Blackburn Rovers in December 2001  probably the biggest mistake Ive ever made  but, reflecting on a career that brought five Premier League winners medals, two FA Cups and a Champions League, not to mention 15 England caps, there are few regrets. Theres always going to be the odd one, with me the way I am as a person, as a player, he said. But I wouldnt change a thing. Ive lived the dream.

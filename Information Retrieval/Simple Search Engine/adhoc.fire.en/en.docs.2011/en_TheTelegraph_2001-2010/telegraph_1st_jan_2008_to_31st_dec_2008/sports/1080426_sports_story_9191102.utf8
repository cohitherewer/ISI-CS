The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No favourites, says Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                           No favourites, says Sourav
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Sourav Ganguly feels no team can be considered favourite for the Indian Premier League. At a news conference on Friday, he said its all a matter of getting ones act right on the given day.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On Saturdays encounter         
	Weve had two good games. We bowled pretty well in both matches. In the first game we did well to dismiss Bangalore Royal Challengers for 82. Then at home we restricted Deccan Chargers to 110 on a dodgy wicket. Tomorrow is a new day and anything can happen.         
	Leading again         
	Nice to be in the role again But its never the same as leading India.         
	Tournament favourites         
	All the teams are well balanced. Anyone who plays well on the given day will prevail. No one ever imagined Deccan Chargers would lose all their first three games. No one has the upper hand in the tournament.         
	Knight Riders chances         
	Weve got the bowlers for all conditions Both for seaming and spinning tracks. Its pretty balanced but weve got to wait and see.         
	Chris Gayles fitness         
	Gayle is still unfit. Hes recovering and will take a week or more to recover fully.         
	Chennai Super Kings chances         
	Theyve got a good batting line up  (Matthew) Hayden, (Michael) Hussey, (Mahendra Singh Dhoni)  Suresh Raina is in pretty good form too. In Twenty20 cricket its hard to predict. Whoever plays well on a given day would win. This is not like Test or one-day cricket where your skills are tested to the limits and you can come back after a bad session or hour.         
	The presence of Muralidharan         
	Hes a great bowler but will be under pressure since he knows that the batsmen will be after him.         
	Shah Rukh Khans absence         
	Forget Knight Riders, the entire Chennai will miss him.         
	Knight Riders bowling         
	We always knew bowling would be the key in a Twenty20 match. So we were keen on a good bowling unit during the auctions. But we also need to bat well.         
	If Twenty20 specialists are needed         
	A good bowler in Tests will do well anywhere and in any condition. The same applies for a good batsman. He can show his best form in any format of the game. Anyone who succeeds in the longer version can adapt quickly to any form since Test cricket remains the ultimate test.         
	The controversy surrounding cheerleaders         
	Ive got no problems with cheerleaders.         
	Saturdays contest being billed as a Sourav versus Dhoni contest         
	Ive been hearing this since the start In Bangalore it was Sourav versus Dravid and in the last match it was Sourav versus Laxman. Im sure Dhoni too must be hearing the same (smiles).

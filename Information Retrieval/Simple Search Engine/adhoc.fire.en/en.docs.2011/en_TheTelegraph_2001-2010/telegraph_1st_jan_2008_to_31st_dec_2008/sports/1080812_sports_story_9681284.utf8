The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England taste victory at last
                                                                                                                                                                                             England taste victory at last

	London: Kevin Pietersen celebrated his first Test as England captain with a consolation six-wicket victory over South Africa in the fourth and final Test on Monday.         
	Andrew Flintoff (11 not out) hit the winning runs with a straight six as he and Paul Collingwood (25 not out) steered the home side to 198 for four.         
	Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook put on 123 for the first wicket, with Cook (67) taking charge until he edged Makhaya Ntini to South Africa skipper Graeme Smith at first slip shortly after lunch.         
	Pietersen, who took over from Michael Vaughan as captain last week, had been keen to salvage pride against the country of his birth after South Africa won the series by going 2-0 up in the third Test at Edgbaston.         
	After scoring a century in Englands first innings, Pietersen came to the crease to rapturous applause with the score on 147 for two after Ntini had bowled Ian Bell round his legs for four.         
	Strauss (58) was also out with the total on 147, nicking spinner Paul Harris to Smith at leg slip.         
	Pietersen failed to take his side home, scoring 13 before pushing a catch to Neil McKenzie off Harris but by then England were only 15 runs short of victory. Cooks innings included 12 fours.

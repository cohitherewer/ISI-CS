The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fielding is the key, says Sanath
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fielding is the key, says Sanath
                      
	Mumbai: Top drawer fielding by the entire team in their last two matches had made a huge difference to the fortunes of the Mumbai Indians outfit, feels one of its key players Sanath Jayasuriya.         
	The key difference in the last two games has been the fielding. It was of a very high standard and lifted the confidence of the players, said the 38-year-old veteran Sri Lankan ace who played a significant role in their shock 29-run victory last night against Delhi DareDevils.         
	Mumbai Indians had lost four straight games before turning around their fortunes against the Sourav Ganguly-led Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens and then defended their small total of 162 against the high-flying DareDevils with vigour and verve.

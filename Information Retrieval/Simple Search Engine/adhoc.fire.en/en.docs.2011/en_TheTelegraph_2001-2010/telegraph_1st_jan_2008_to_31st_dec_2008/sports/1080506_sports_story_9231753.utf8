The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF sticks to 12-team format for I-League
                                                                                                                                                                                                     AIFF sticks to 12-team format for I-League
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Salgaocars dream of retaining their place in the I-League was shattered on Monday when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) decided to stick to their 12-team stance for the 2008-09 season.         
	Salgaocar and Viva Kerala, who were relegated from the I-League this season, had an outside chance of making a comeback if the federation decided to increase the number of teams in the league.         
	The AIFF, in a press release, said that a two-member committee, which was appointed to decisively decide the issue, has ruled in favour of 12 teams.         
	The two-member committee has also pointed out that under the I-League regulations, no demoted team can be retained for the next season.         
	The committee also said that in the presentation given to Fifa, it was stated that the I-League 2008-09 would consist of 12 teams.         
	The confusion about the number of teams in the I-League next season started in February when AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi asked the executive committee to consider introducing play-offs to decide relegation.         
	Later, in an interview to the Fifa website, Das Munshi said that 14 teams would play in the next I-League. Though AIFF sources later said that Das Munshi was misquoted, no official denial was issued.         
	Interestingly, the two-member committee, which never met formally, also quoted one of AIFFs previous decisions in 2007 when Salgaocars request to be retained in the premier division was turned down on the plea that no demoted team could be retained. Instead, HAL, who were then placed third in the second division, were promoted.         
	Everyone in the AIFF knows that at that time Das Munshi took personal initiative to put HAL in the I-League (then NFL), said a source in the AIFF. It was interesting to note that the committee members (Auto Mezhur and SR Dev) could dig out that instance and act on similar lines.

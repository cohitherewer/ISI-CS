The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Email didnt create pressure: Younis 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Email didnt create pressure: Younis 
                  Younis Khan                     
	Karachi: Senior Pakistan batsman Younis Khan on Sunday asserted that there was no pressure on the players following the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairmans strong reaction after the embarrassing defeat at the hands of the arch rivals in the league stage of the tri-series tournament.         
	After Pakistans crushing 140-run loss to India in the group stages, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf had shot an email to the team manager Talat Ali seeking an explanation.         
	Younis, who cracked a century in the summit clash, said the email did not have a negative impact on the morale of the team.         
	No, there was no pressure on us. Neither the mail sent by the chairman nor his arrival in Dhaka for the final created any pressure.         
	He in fact, is a very loving person and when he met us, boosted our confidence and self- belief, Younis told reporters.         
	After the exciting win over India on Saturday, seven members of the victorious Pakistan team including Younis Khan, Kamran Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Umar Gul, Salman Butt, Mohammed Yousuf and Misbah-ul Haq returned home on Sunday.         
	Younis said that the huge defeat against India in the league stages was the result of lack of practice for his teammates during the opulent Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	There is a big difference between Twenty20 and 50-over matches, so most of the players were out of touch, he added.         
	The defeat to India in the group match did rock us and we worked hard in last three days to prepare a plan and practiced according to the plan for the final.         
	He pointed out that in comparison to them, the Indian players were all in good form as they featured regularly in the IPL games for their respective teams.         
	Younis, who was signed up by the champions of the inaugural edition of the IPL Rajasthan Royals played just one match in the entire 44-day extravaganza.         
	Younis had a lot of praise for Tanvir saying the IPL had raised the left-armers stock and also assured that youngsters like Wahab Riaz, Fawad Alam and Nasir Jamshed were good players and the future of Pakistan cricket.         
	Fawad Alam is also doing good. I think by the time Yousuf and I retire, Fawad will be ready to take the responsibility of the middle order. Sohail Khan didnt get the chance in the tournament but he is also a good find, he said.         
	The senior batsman further said that the victory over arch rivals will act as a confidence booster for Pakistan ahead of the Asia Cup, to be hosted by Pakistan from June 24.         
	Victory is important before the Asia Cup. Our confidence is now high and we are confident of winning the Asia Cup also.         
	Pacer Umar Gul, who took four wickets in the final, and allrounder Shahid Afridi said that the players had gelled as a team in the final which resulted in their triumph.         
	We never allowed India to build big partnerships and that was the key to success.         
	The best thing about the win was that the players fought well as a team, something we have been lacking in the past. When we play as a unit we usually end up as winners, said Afridi.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Portuguese, Czechs eye last-8 berth
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Portuguese, Czechs eye last-8 berth
                      
	Neuchatel (Switzerland): Group A favourites Portugal or Czech Republic could on Wednesday become the first team to book a place in the Euro 2008 quarter finals.         
	Portugal, who beat Turkey 2-0 in their opening match, and the Czechs, less than convincing 1-0 winners of the tournament opener against co-hosts Switzerland on Saturday, meet in Geneva.         
	Our idea is to play to win and go through, said Portugal playmaker Deco.         
	It is in midfield that the Czechs will have to make a big improvement if they are to compete with the lively creative partnership of Deco and Joao Moutinho.         
	It was good (linking with Moutinho) ... Every day hes more mature. It was easy combining with him, the 54-cap Deco said of his 21-year-old teammate, who made his 14th appearance for Portugal on Saturday.         
	Czech Republic won the teams only previous European Championship meeting 1-0 in the Euro 96 quarter finals in England. They would have met in the final four years ago in Lisbon but for the giant-killing exploits of Greece.         
	Goalkeeper Petr Cech could prove to be Portugals biggest obstacle although the Czech back four can also form a formidable barrier.         
	Portugal have no injury worries and they are also back to 23 men following the arrival on Sunday of goalkeeper Nuno Espirito Santo to replace the injured Quim as Ricardos understudy, but coach Luiz Felipe Scolari is unlikely to make changes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Prakash leads India to 3-2 win
                                                  Prakash leads India to 3-2 win
            JAYDEEP BASU            Indian players during a lap of honour after their win over Uzbekistan on Sunday                           
	New Delhi: After Prakash Amritraj served to win the final point against Uzbekistans Farrukh Dustov in the fifth and final rubber of the Asia-Oceania Davis Cup tie, captain Leander Paes rushed to the court and lifted Prakash on his shoulders.         
	Paes, who was soon joined by other Indian players for an impromptu celebration, was literally in tears after the hard earned 3-2 victory. Two days ago, he had slammed Amritraj as being unprofessional. On Sunday he called the US-based player the hero of his team.         
	Paes was not far from truth. After Denis Istomin rallied from two sets and 1-3 down to defeat Rohan Bopanna 4-6, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-1), 8-6 and level the tie 2-2, it was left to Amritraj to steer India out of the woods.         
	Amritraj, in the eye of a storm for the past few days for talking against his captain, did not disappoint. He held on to his nerves and beat Dustov in the decider 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 in two hours and 14 minutes.         
	An emotional Paes later said: There were some ups and downs for the team this week. But we stuck together and played with unity. I am proud of my team.         
	We did the toss and Prakash came to me and said: Let us put behind all that has happened. Its just you and me on the court now. We had a roller-coaster week with the media. I am proud of Prakash and here is my hero, Paes said with tears rolling down his eyes.         
	The Indian tennis icon was visibly proud that his tactics had paid dividends. He was bitterly criticised for not fielding Amritraj in the first two days. But on Sunday, Paes proved that it was a right tactic to hold back Amritraj for the final onslaught.         
	What we learnt here was that whatever we say in team meetings, it should stay there. We tackled adversity and believed in each other. That, in the end, proved crucial.         
	I wanted Prakash to take an extra days rest. My gut feeling was that we would get to the decider. I wanted him to come out with fresh legs against Dustov.         
	The Indian camp had become tense when Bopanna flattered to deceive and lost a five-setter against a highly skilful Istomin. Though Prakash was the favourite against Dustov, there was a feeling that the clay court specialist from Uzbekistan may topple the rusty Indian.         
	Amritraj, however, didnt allow Dustov much room and raced to a 6-3 win in the first set after breaking the big-serving Uzbek in the eighth game. Dustov won the second set but that was all he could do. He needed a medical break after losing his serve in the third set and never really recovered from that.         
	The Uzbek looked desolate and blew away the few chances that came his way. Amritraj, on the other hand, was quick to pounce on mistakes and broke Dustov him twice in the fourth set to seal the issue for India.

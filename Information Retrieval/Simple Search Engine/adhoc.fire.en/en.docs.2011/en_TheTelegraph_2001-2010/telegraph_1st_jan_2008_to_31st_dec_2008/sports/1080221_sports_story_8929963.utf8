                                                   Vogts   quits
                            
	Lagos: Berti Vogts has quit as Nigeria national coach with immediate effect, the German Football Federation said on Wednesday.         
	The 61-year-old, who guided Germany to victory in the 1996 European Championship, had been heavily criticised in Nigeria following their African Nations Cup quarter-final defeat to hosts Ghana, the Federations website said.         
	In a statement reported by German sports news agency SID, Vogts criticised the Nigerian Football Association for their lack of support for his training team in the face of heavy attacks in the Nigerian media.         
	The actions and behaviour of the Nigerian Football Association during and after the African Nations Cup have destroyed all trust between the two parties and further cooperation is impossible, Vogts lawyer Stefan von Moers said.

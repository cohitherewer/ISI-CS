The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal humiliated by Stoke City
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Arsenal humiliated by Stoke City

	London: Nicolas Anelka hit a hat trick Saturday to help Chelsea beat visiting Sunderland 5-0 in the Premier League and rebound from last weeks loss to Liverpool.         
	While Arsenals poor week continued with a humiliating 2-1 loss at Stoke  which let Manchester United take third place with a 4-3 win over visiting Hull  Anelka scored twice in the first half and once in the second as Chelsea went to 26 points.         
	Frank Lampard also scored his 100th career league goal but Chelsea had to wait for the result of Liverpools late match at Tottenham to find out whether their win was enough to take them above the Reds at the top of the Premier League. Liverpool can keep first place if they avoid defeat at Spurs.         
	Chelsea never looked like losing at Stamford Bridge, particularly after Brazil defender Alex scored from a close-range rebound in the 27th minute.         
	Anelka, who had hit just six goals in 25 Premier League appearances since joining Chelsea in January, made it 2-0 three minutes later when he touched in Alexs goal-bound shot. The France striker scored again in the 45th from a pass by Florent Malouda and Sunderlands problems were compounded when manager Roy Keane was sent to the stands at halftime for protesting Anelkas first goal.         
	Lampard made it 4-0 with a header six minutes into the second half, notching his 99th goal in the Premier League, and Anelka completed his first hat trick in England since September 2003 with a 53rd-minute finish from Maloudas low cross.         
	Arsenal were seeking victory at lowly Stoke to rally from the disappointment of Wednesdays 4-4 draw with fierce rivals Tottenham, but ended up losing third place to the defending champions.         
	Stoke took a 11th-minute lead when Ricardo Fuller hit his fifth goal of the season from a long throw by Rory Delap, while Seyi Olofinjana made it 2-0 in the 73rd.         
	Arsenal got an injury-time goal from Gael Clichy but a miserable day already looked assured when substitute Robin Van Persie was sent off for elbowing goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen and winger Theo Walcott was carried from the field with what looked like a serious shoulder injury.         
	That meant Manchester United moved up three places after surviving a late comeback from Hull to move above the Tigers in the standings.         
	Michael Carrick and Nemanja Vidic added to Cristiano Ronaldos two goals to put United 4-1 ahead before Bernard Mendy and Geovanni scored for Hull to make it close.         
	Also Saturday, Everton improved upon the worst home record in Englands 92-team professional league when Louis Saha scored with three minutes to give Everton a 1-0 win over Fulham and their first home victory of the season.         
	Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard had a fluke goal ruled out because of a foul by a teammate and Fulham twice hit the frame before Saha headed a cross by Leon Osman to score his first goal for the club.         
	Howards chance came when he hit a huge kick up field and watched it bounce into the opposite goal. But the referee ruled out the effort because Everton striker Yakubu Ayegbeni had knocked goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to the ground.         
	West Ham drew 1-1 at Middlesbrough, Blackburn drew 2-2 at West Bromwich Albion, and Wigan won 2-1 at Portsmouth.           (AP)

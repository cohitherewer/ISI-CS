            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Top junior golfers of the country will be in action when the Lalit Suri All-India Junior Golf Championship tees off at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club on Tuesday.         
	The tournament, which has served as the breeding ground for the likes of Jeev Milkha Singhs and Jyoti Randhawas, will be played in the stroke-play format.         
	The players have been divided into four age-group categories.         
	Teenager Rashid Khan, who won three consecutive amateur events this year, is favourite to clinch the title.         
	The youngster, who was crowned Faldo Series Asia champion for 2007 at Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen, said: After three tournament victories on the amateur circuit and rubbing shoulders with some of the best players on the Asian Tour, my confidence level is on a new high.         
	I would like to end the year with a victory and nothing less.         
	I am not taking this tournament lightly as there are a number of good players who have the ability to win, said the amateur who recently took part in the Volvo Masters Asia 2008 in Bangkok.

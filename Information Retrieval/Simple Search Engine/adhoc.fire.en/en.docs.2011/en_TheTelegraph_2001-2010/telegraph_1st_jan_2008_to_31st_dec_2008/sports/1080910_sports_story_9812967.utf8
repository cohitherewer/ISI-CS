                                                                                                                                                                                                     Referee roughed up
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Referee Rathin Mukherjee along with his assistant referees Arup Chakraborty and Kashi Nath Sen and fourth official Uttam Sarkar were mobbed by a group of Mohun Bagan supporters after Tuesdays match against Camellia George Telegraph at the Mohun Bagan ground.         
	Minutes after the match was over, despite the presence of several police personnel, a group of Bagan fans rushed onto the ground after jumping over the fencing. Policemen present at the venue were mere bystanders as enraged Bagan fans roughed up the four match officials.         
	Some George Telegraph officials intervened and escorted the four outside the ground.         
	Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra said: We had a meeting with police before the match. We have told them several times to face the spectators but they always prefer sitting with their backs to the stands.         
	As soon as the match is over they start getting out of the ground instead of keep a tight vigil, Mitra said.         
	It was learnt that the referees will take up the matter with the Indian Football Association.

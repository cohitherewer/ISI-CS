The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rankings not a distraction for me: Nadal
                                                   Rankings not a distraction for me: Nadal
                      
	Indian Wells: Rafael Nadal has closed the gap on world number one Roger Federer but the Spaniard refuses to be distracted by thoughts of ranking points at this weeks Pacific Life Open.         
	Nadal, who trails the dominant Swiss by just 350 points in the global pecking order, is fully focused on his title defence at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden in the opening Masters Series event of the season.         
	It is closer in the rankings but not closer if you know exactly what I have to defend right now, the 21-year-old told reporters on Thursday.         
	I have to defend my title here, so maybe this is not the moment for me to be world number one, thats for sure.         
	Federer, who has spent a record 215 consecutive weeks at the top of the mens rankings, has 6,330 points with Nadal in second spot on 5,980.         
	It is the closest margin since May 10, 2004 when Federer led American Andy Roddick, also by 350 points.         
	Left-hander Nadal is unable to overhaul the 26-year-old Swiss at Indian Wells but could do so at the Masters Series event in Miami, which starts on March 24.         
	Last year I played an unbelievable season and now I am closer to him, said the muscular Spaniard, who piled up six ATP titles in 2007, including a third successive French Open.         
	But this is a new season and my goal is never watching the tournaments. I always think about how to play good and my goal is always the ranking. I know if I want to reach my goals I have to play very good in important tournaments. Thats it.

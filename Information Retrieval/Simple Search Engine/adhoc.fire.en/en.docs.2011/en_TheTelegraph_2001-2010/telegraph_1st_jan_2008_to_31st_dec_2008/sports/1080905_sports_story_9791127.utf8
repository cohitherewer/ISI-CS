The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan on course with 2-1 victory
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bagan on course with 2-1 victory
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans 2-1 victory over Calcutta Port Trust in the Sahara CFL Premier Division match on Thursday was a timely reminder of the saying: Theres many a slip between the cup and the lip.         
	The green-and-maroon brigade need to win every point on offer to ensure the league title does not slip out of their grasp, but they were in danger of dropping points more than once on Thursday.         
	But with the hard fought win they now have 27 points from 12 matches, three more than second-placed Mohammedan Sporting.         
	Bagan fans heaved a sigh of relief after the final whistle was blown, but they had their hearts in their mouth when torrential rain started just before the match.         
	Abandonment would have left not only the title but also the completion of the league uncertain. The conditions had no further say in the match (which was delayed by 15 minutes) and when Bagan made it 1-0 in the fourth minute through Lalawmpuiya, everyone thought the title hopefuls would grab three points easily, but that was not to be.         
	The easy chance for the Bagan marksman was created by Shylo Malsawmtluanga. He intercepted a clearance off the flag-kick and passed it on to Lalawmpuiya, who was left unmarked inside the penalty area and finished with a right footer.         
	CPT equalised early into the second half. They could not be blamed for feeling unlucky. First, the corner kick was taken without placing the ball in the right spot.         
	Second, Avijit Ghosh, the scorer, was actually trying to get out of the corner kicks way. His failure turned into his teams success as the deflection went in.         
	A little later Rakesh Masih headed back a long throw-in from Man of the Match Peter Odafe into the goalmouth.         
	A diving N.S. Manju headed the ball in to make it 2-1 for Bagan. The relieved Bagan fans were happy to see Bhaichung Bhutia in action for the last 15 minutes.         
	Talking to the media after the match, the Bagan coach expressed his unhappiness over the referees performance. There were some conspicuous errors. The ball was not being placed at the right spot while taking the corner kicks, he said. But I dont want to talk about it because of the rules and regulations, Bencharifa added.

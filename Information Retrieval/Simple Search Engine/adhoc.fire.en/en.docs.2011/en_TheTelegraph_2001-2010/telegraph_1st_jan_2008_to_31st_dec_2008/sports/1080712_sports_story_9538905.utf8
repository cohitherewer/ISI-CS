	New Delhi: India recorded their second consecutive victory in their tour of Portugal with a 3-2 win over Grupo Desportivo da Gafanha on Thursday night.         
	According to information received here, India, who were without their skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, took the lead through Bungo Singh.         
	Sunil Chhetri, who was brought down inside the box, struck from the resultant spot kick to give India a 2-0 lead during half-time. In the second half, the home team levelled the score with two quick goals but Tarif Ahmed saved the day for India when he headed home the match winner off a Denzil Franco flag-kick.         
	India changed the entire team in the second-half and virtually played two teams in the match.

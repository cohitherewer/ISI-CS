The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chong finds competition from Blyth
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chong finds competition from Blyth
  - Jeev climbs up to fifth spot, Randhawa slips further       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jeev Milkha Singh at the Delhi Golf Club on Saturday                                 
	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh made a huge recovery to climb up the leaderboard in the Hero Honda Indian Open here on Saturday, but it was not enough to dislodge Liang Wen-Chong, who continued to dazzle for the third consecutive day at the Delhi Golf Club (DGC).         
	While the Chinese golfer once again remained the sole leader with a 14-under 202, breathing down his neck on the penultimate afternoon was Adam Blyth of Australia at 13-under. He turned in a six-under 66 that was studded with eight birdies against a couple of bogeys, on the back nine.         
	Another Australian, Unho Park, returned a 66, which was a bogey-free affair, but lay a stroke behind Blyth at the sole third spot. Sweden s Daniel Chopra and defending champion Jyoti Randhawa, however, disappointed the holiday crowd. While Chopra slipped to a tie for the 18th spot after a 74, Randhawa carded a 73 and was in joint 55th position.         
	Among the Indians, Jeev Milkha Singh and Ashok Kumar stayed in the hunt with a joint fifth position. Jeev was particularly impressive as he played some breathtaking golf in his blemish free front nine. The Chandigarh-based professional, who is yet to win an open title on the home turf and was placed 17th on the second day, picked up an eagle on the eighth before striking a birdie on the ninth to make the turn four under.         
	Things could have been brighter for Jeev but he once again faltered on the back nine and stumbled to three bogeys on the 10th, 13th and the 16th.         
	Jeev, however, was pleased with his performance and said he hoped to get better on the concluding day.         
	I played rock solid today, Jeev said. In fact, I played very well in the front nine. Putting was much better. I am playing good and trusting myself.         
	Ashok Kumar, who is also in contention for a top-five finish, had a good day in the office at the DGC. Like Jeev, he had a perfect front nine studded with birdies on the second fifth and the eighth.         
	I hit the ball really well today (Saturday). However, my putting was not up to the mark. Had I putted well, I could have been in a much better position. I missed short birdie putts, Ashok said later.         
	Liang, who looked all set to wrap up the title on the final day, said he was happy with the way things were going.         
	The holes here are tough and its always a challenge. I wasnt playing safe but at the same time I cant really be aggressive here. Adam played well but there are still 18 holes left tomorrow. So we shall see what happens, said Liang.

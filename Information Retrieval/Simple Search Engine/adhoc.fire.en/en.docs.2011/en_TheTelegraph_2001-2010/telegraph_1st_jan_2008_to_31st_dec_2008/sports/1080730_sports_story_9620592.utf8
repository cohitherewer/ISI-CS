	Calcutta: East Bengal beat United SC 1-0 on Tuesday in their mid-table clash in the Sahara CFL Premier Division. The win, despite another poor performance takes the red-and-golds to eight points after five matches.         
	East Bengals Brazilian striker Edmilson Marquez didnt even feature on the substitutes bench, but fans welcomed back the seasoned veteran, Suley Musah to the side.         
	 The thirty eight-year-old Ghanaian defender was a desperate addition to the East Bengal side to bolster a wilting defence that had let in five goals in the last four matches. Musah who captained the ASEAN Cup winning East Bengal side in 2003, did a commendable job in defusing rare United SC attacks, alongside Anupam Sarkar in the heart of defence.         
	Neither side looked threatening in a dull first half as the two goalkeepers Arnab Das Sarma and Somnath Khanra were largely untroubled.         
	United SC came closest to scoring in the 32nd minute when captain Malswama Hamars shot was parried by Das Sarma and Soumik Chakrabortys follow-up was thwarted by Musah.         
	East Bengal lacked any kind of attacking verve and looked destined to drop points again, until a moment of brilliance from Ashim Biswas in the 50th minute gave Manoranjan Bhattacharjees boys the lead. Ashim ended his recent goal drought by unleashing a left-footed pile driver from 25 yards out that gave Khanra in the United SC goal no chance.         
	United SC coach Anjan Nath threw in Argentinian striker Maximilliano, desperate for an equaliser for his side. The Argentinian came close twice with headers that went narrowly wide. Musah braved repeated attacks of cramps and battled on, before being replaced in the 78th minute.         
	The East Bengal defence sans Musah looked nervy in the last ten minutes, but managed to hold on for their second win of the CFL.

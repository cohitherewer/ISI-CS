            A STAFF REPORTER            Shalabh Srivastav of Delhi Giants bowls against Ahmedabad Rockets in Hyderabad on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Calcutta: The Royal Bengal Tigers started their Indian Cricket League (ICL) campaign on a winning note beating Lahore Badshahs comprehensively at the LB stadium in Hyderabad on Sunday.         
	The Tigers defeated the Badshahs by 8 wickets riding on a brilliant 53-ball 76 by Man of the Match Hamish Marshall. The city side reached the target of 140 with two overs to spare.         
	The Badshahs, led by former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, had a steady start with their two openers  Imran Farhat and Imran Nazir  reaching 22 for no loss within three overs. But experienced Sri Lankan leggie Upul Chandana bagged four crucial wickets to halt their progress.         
	The Tigers were in a dominating position when Inzamam walked in. The veteran Pakistani batsman looking dangerous, scoring nineteen off just eleven balls. He fell to Chandana nicking one to Deep Dasgupta.         
	Some sharp fielding also tightened the screws on the Badshahs. Tigers tight bowling restricted the mighty Badshahs to a paltry 139/6 in the allotted 20 overs.         
	Hamish Marshall, accompanying the experienced Deep Dasgupta, got the city team off to a good start. Both batsmen made most of the lacklustre fielding from the Badshahs, playing some sensible strokes to take the score to 42 at the five over mark. In the end the Tigers romped home to a big win by 8 wickets and over two overs to spare.         
	Meanwhile, in another match, Delhi Giants beat Ahmedabad Rockets by 13 runs.

	Hyderabad: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haqs bid to avenge last years defeat to Hyderabad Heroes remained unfulfilled as of Friday night with the Haq led Lahore Badshahs losing by 18 runs in the opening match of the rebel Indian Cricket League that was hit by power failure.         
	The Lal Bahadur Shastri stadium plunged into darkness when all the four floodlights went off all of a sudden, forcing the match to a halt.         
	After waiting for around 50 minutes, umpires declared Hyderabad Heroes the winners by 18 runs, according to the VJD method.         
	Chasing a moderate target of 166 set by the Hyderabad team earlier, Lahore Badshahs were on 30 for two in six overs when the lights went out forcing both teams off the ground temporarily.         
	Lahore skipper Inzamam-ul Haq was batting on 9 and opener Imran Nazir was unbeaten on 19 when lights failed.         
	Lahore Badshahs had lost 0-2 in the best of three finals to the Hyderabad Heroes last year. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Classic do-or-die match for Italy
                                                                                                                                                                                           Classic do-or-die match for Italy
                      
	Zurich: Italy will take on Romania on Friday the 13th in the 13th match of the 13th European Championship. The world champions, smarting from the 0-3 drubbing by The Netherlands, will be glad that the unlucky number in Italy is 17.         
	If the Azzurri lose on Friday, they will be out of contention before facing rivals France four days later. A draw wont help much, either. And another defeat would almost certainly lead to coach Roberto Donadonis departure.         
	This is the classic do-or-die match, defender Gianluca Zambrotta said. Weve got to give our maximum and fight for every ball. The only result were interested in is a victory.         
	The defeat in their group C opener on Monday means all areas of the team are under review. Donadoni could make wholesale line-up changes for the match by inserting Fabio Grosso and Giorgio Chiellini in defence, Daniele de Rossi in midfield and Alessandro del Piero in attack.         
	Del Piero replaced Antonio di Natale alongside Toni in the second half against The Netherlands, with Antonio Cassano also coming on.         
	Romania, who drew 0-0 with France on Monday, think Italy will attack from the start. Hopefully they will leave some gaps at the back for us to exploit. We expect a different approach to the French, said captain Cristian Chivu.         
	Romanias game plan will be much the same as against France with the focus on defence rather than goals.         
	We will defend, defend, defend. Our plan is not to get beaten, said Adrian Mutu. The forward, deeply affected by the recent death of his grandmother, hopes to improve on his poor display against France.         
	Romania coach Victor Piturca has promised that the real Mutu  the player who scored 17 goals in Serie A last season  will show up against Italy. (AGENCIES)

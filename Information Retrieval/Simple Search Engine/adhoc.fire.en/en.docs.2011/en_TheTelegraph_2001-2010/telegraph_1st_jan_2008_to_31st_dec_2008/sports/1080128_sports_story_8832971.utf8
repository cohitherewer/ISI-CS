The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting, Clarke take Australia ahead
                                                Ponting, Clarke take Australia ahead
                      
	Adelaide: India held a narrow lead over Australia after the penultimate day of the fourth and final Test at Adelaide Oval on Sunday.         
	The visitors were 45 for one at stumps in their second innings, a lead of eight runs after trailing Australia by 37 on the first innings. The odds could have been heavily stacked in favour of the hosts had Michael Clarke held on to a chance from Virender Sehwag. The Indians will have to bat out the first session on the final day with caution .         
	Ricky Ponting (140), Clarke (118) and Matthew Hayden (103) all scored centuries to steer Australia past Indias first innings total of 526.         
	Irfan Pathan (3/112)and Ishant Sharma (3/115) captured three wickets each as the tourists polished off the last six Australian wickets for 73 runs after Ponting and Clarke had shared a record partnership of 210. India need to win the match to level the series at 2-2 after losing in Melbourne and Sydney and winning in Perth, but the match appears headed for a draw with only one day left to play.         
	The Australians made no obvious attempt to chase quick runs to try and force a result despite Ponting and Clarkes hundreds.         
	The pair had come together on Saturday afternoon when Hayden departed and batted through the entire first session unscathed.         
	Ponting ended a lean run with the bat to chalk up his 34th Test hundred to join Brian Lara and Sunil Gavaskar in second place on the all-time list of centurymakers.         
	The only player to have scored more is Indias Sachin Tendulkar, who completed his 39th hundred earlier in the match. The Australian skipper brought up his hundred off 183 balls flicked spinner Harbhajan Singh off his pads for a single but batted with a runner after lunch when he began to experience back spasms and did not field in Indias second innings.         
	He was dismissed when he got an inside edge off Virender Sehwag onto his stumps, ending a record fourth wicket stand with Clarke for Australia against India, breaking the previous mark of 178 set by Allan Border and Dean Jones at Chennai in 1986.         
	Clarke survived a dropped catch from Rahul Dravid on 84 to bring up his sixth Test century before he was caught at second slip by V.V.S. Laxman off Irfan, triggering a lower-order collapse.         
	Adam Gilchrist could manage only 14 in his farewell appearance, while Andrew Symonds (30), Brett Lee (one), Mitchell Johnson (13) and Stuart Clark (three) also missed out on big scores, leaving Brad Hogg stranded on 16 not out.         
	Gilchrist, who stunned the cricket world when he announced his retirement on Saturday, arrived and departed the crease to a standing ovation from the crowd and the Indian players.         
	With two sumptuous cuts, interspersed by a glorious straight drive which had umpire Billy Bowden rolling over in turf for cover, showed the wicketkeeper-batsman wanted to go out in a flourish.

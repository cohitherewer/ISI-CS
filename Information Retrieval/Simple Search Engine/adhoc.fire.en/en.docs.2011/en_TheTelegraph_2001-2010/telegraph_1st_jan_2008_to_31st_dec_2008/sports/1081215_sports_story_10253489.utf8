The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Virender is exceptional: Strauss
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Virender is exceptional: Strauss
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: It was set to be Andrew Strausss day but Virender Sehwag stole the limelight in the final session. Strauss admitted Sehwags innings had given India a sniff of victory.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	His innings         
	Yes, it is a big moment for me. It was a real special moment to play alongside Collingwood in a pretty difficult situation for the team. Every player goes through ups and downs. Certainly 2007 was a tough year for me. There were moments when I thought I was not good enough to play for England again. But being patient helped Once you get back to form it all counts... I felt comfortable in the second innings.         
	Sehwags innings         
	Sehwag is exceptional. He always takes the game to the opposition, and frankly, Im unfamiliar to the way he plays. He got his luck a little bit. But thats the kind of player he is. He has given India a sniff of victory. Its amazing to see the freedom with which he plays. Exceptionally pleasing to watch if you are not in the opposition         
	The teams approach on Monday         
	From our point of view I think we are still confident we can take the last nine wickets. There is definitely a lot happening on the wicket. If we just remain patient, there will be nine opportunities for us. You have to have a pretty defensive field. So that makes it harder to take wickets. He is out of the way. The batsmen coming next will play pretty positively. To survive on such wickets you have to be positive anyway. We will have to hold our nerve and take our chances.         
	On how difficult it is for a captain to set field against Sehwag         
	Its pretty tricky for a captain to set field for a player like him. We had some plans for him, but he went over the heads of the fielders. It is important you dont get carried away.         
	When someone takes so many risks it will mean one risk too many. You do not get wild when someone is batting like that. He played one ball from Anderson between first and second slip. But you cant do anything about that whatever the field placements or otherwise.         
	Englands slow run rate, and if there was a message to speed things up in the second session . Unfortunately I got out quickly after lunch. To force the issue with a very old ball is very difficult. We were trying to do that.

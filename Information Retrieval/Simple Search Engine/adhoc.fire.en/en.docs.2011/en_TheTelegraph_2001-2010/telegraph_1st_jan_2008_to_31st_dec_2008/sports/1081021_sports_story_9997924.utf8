The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Century was worth the wait: Gambhir
                                                                                                                                                                                             Century was worth the wait: Gambhir
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Gautam Gambhir in Mohali on Monday                           
	Mohali: Swashbuckling opener Gautam Gambhir termed Mondays century against Australia as a very important one in his career and said that this hundred might help in cementing his place in the squad.               
	The following are the excerpts:         
	On his second century         
	It took me some time to get my second century. I scored my first ton against Bangladesh. However, getting a century against Australia was a great one. It was worth the wait. We did excellently well today.         
	Why he was failing to convert the starts into big ones         
	I was taking a lot of time. I was getting stuck at 60s and 70s. I was thinking about it. I was getting the starts and it was happening every time in the past. So I thought of looking at the present and just think of each ball and react to that. And it happened. Its important to get a good start and score as many as runs possible.         
	Indias game plan         
	Just go out there and try and win the match. It is not easy for the opposition team batting fourth in India. We have two quality spinners in Harbhajan and Amit Mishra. The way they bowled in the first innings It became very difficult for the Australians. 500 is a very good total. We have already seen the way Bhajji and Ishant bowled in the second innings They were tremendous.         
	His performance in the Test arena         
	As a cricketer you always want to play Test cricket and want to do well in Test cricket. You are known more by your Test deeds than in ODIs or Twenty20s. We do want to be remembered as Test cricketers. There was lot of pressure to establish myself and today was a very important knock for me as it could help me cement my place in the side.         
	His chemistry with Sehwag         
	We played a lot of cricket together. It is always good to have a good partnership and good understanding also off the field. It was crucial to have a good partnership. I always have extra confidence when Sehwag is batting at the other end. When you are opening the innings, it is always difficult when you are playing the new ball. Sehwag is one person you can share your thoughts with. So far it has been working out well.         
	Sehwag missing his century         
	It doesnt matter if someone misses his century. What matters is the team. If the runs help the team well, that is what matters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Surgery to sideline Woods for season
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Surgery to sideline Woods for season
                  Tiger Woods                     
	Los Angeles: Tiger Woods will have reconstructive surgery on his left knee that will sideline him for the rest of the 2008 season, the world No.1 said on Wednesday.         
	The 32-year-old American defied jabbing pain all week before clinching his 14th major title at the US Open on Monday, winning a 19-hole playoff against compatriot Rocco Mediate.         
	It was his first tournament in two months since having surgery to clean out cartilage in the knee, two days after the US Masters in mid-April.         
	Woods outlined that he would have reconstructive surgery on his anterior cruciate ligament, which he tore 11 months ago after last years British Open at Carnoustie.         
	He also said that he would require time off to rehabilitate a double stress fracture of his left tibia that was found last month and attributed to his intense rehabilitation and preparation for the US Open at Torrey Pines in San Diego.         
	I know much was made of my knee throughout the last week and it was important for me that I disclose my condition publicly at an appropriate time, Woods said in a statement on his official website.         
	I wanted to be very respectful of the USGA (United States Golf Association) and their incredible hard work and make sure the focus was on the US Open.         
	Now, it is clear that the right thing to do is to listen to my doctors, follow through with this surgery and focus my attention on rehabilitating my knee.         
	Woods, who has already had three previous surgeries on his left knee, refused to disclose much detail of the pain he clearly suffered at Torrey Pines last week.         
	However, he rated his major triumph as the most meaningful of his career given the obstacles he faced, an opinion echoed by his swing coach Hank Haney.         
	I certainly think its the greatest win hes ever had, Haney told reporters on Monday. He had only played 27 practice holes since the Masters and he never hit more than 50 balls a day on the range.         
	Moments after securing his 14th major title and his 65th career victory on the PGA Tour, Woods admitted that he had defied doctors orders to compete at Torrey Pines. As far as future ramifications, Im not really good at listening to doctors orders too well, he added.         
	On Wednesday, he conceded he needed to follow medical advice for the sake of his long-term career.         
	While I am obviously disappointed that I would have to miss the remainder of the season, I have to do the right thing for my long-term health, said Woods, who initially had surgery on his left knee in 1994, to remove a benign tumour, followed by arthroscopic surgery in December 2002.         
	I look forward to returning to competitive golf when my doctors agree that my knee is sufficiently healthy. My doctors are assuring me that with proper rehabilitation and training, the knee will be strong and there will be no long-term effects.         
	The driving force behind Woodss career has been his desire to overhaul the record 18 major titles piled up by his childhood idol Jack Nicklaus. Woods now trails by four with only Nicklaus ahead of him.         
	Its hard to believe Im in this situation, Woods said.         
	Its hard to believe Ive had this nice run in my career and hopefully it will continue. Im going to keep practising, keep trying to grind and get better, the world No.1 said.

                                                   Tendulkar ruled out of second Test
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                Sachin Tendulkar      
	Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar has been ruled of the second Test against South Africa in Ahmedabad from Thursday with a right groin strain.         
	Anil Kumble also has a groin strain and his fitness will be ascertained on the eve of the match.         
	Mohammed Kaif, who last played a Test in Kingston during the 2006 tour of the West Indies, will replace Sachin. The Uttar Pradesh and Central Zone player has had an impressive domestic season, scoring 993 runs in 13 first-class matches at an average of 58.41.         
	Fast bowler Ishant Sharma has also been included in the 15-member squad.         
	Sachin, who missed part of the action on the first, second and the fourth days of the Chennai Test, didnt take the field on Sunday. He suffered the injury during the tour Down Under and aggravated it while playing here.         
	Sachin, who scored a duck in Indias mammoth 627 and was also down with a stomach bug on the final day of the Test, has been advised a weeks rest. He left for Mumbai late on Sunday evening.         
	As a precautionary measure, Kumble decided to come off the field a little after lunch. I had a slight niggle while I was bowling. I didnt want to take a chance. The match was probably over by then. Its important to ensure that I recover well for the second Test, the captain said.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India said in a statement: The physio is confident Kumble will be available for the second Test. A final decision in this regard will be taken on Wednesday.         
	Kumble also said he was happy with Ishants recovery. He is looking good, progressing well. Theres still a couple of days before we take a final call on him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Miandad wary of IPL
                                                                                                                                                                                           Miandad wary of IPL
                      
	Karachi: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has come in for flak from former Pakistan captains Javed Miandad and Wasim Akram, who feel the cash-rich Twenty20 competition has begun to affect the international calendar.         
	The IPL has already started hurting the international calendar and in the long run it will encourage more private parties and organisations to come in and start their own leagues if they have big money to roll, former Pakistan captain Miandad said on Friday.         
	He said the BCCI-backed League would create a divide in international cricket.         
	People are comparing the IPL with the Kerry Packer series in the late 70s. But these are totally different things. The Packer series was held when players were paid ridiculously low wages, Miandad said.         
	Meanwhile, the ICCs principal adviser-designate, I.S. Bindra, on Friday asserted that the IPL was no threat to the international cricket calendar and was only aimed at taking the game to a higher level.

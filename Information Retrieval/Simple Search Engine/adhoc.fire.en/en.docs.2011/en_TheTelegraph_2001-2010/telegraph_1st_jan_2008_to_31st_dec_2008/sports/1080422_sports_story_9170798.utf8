	Aussies Pak tour to hit IPL   
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia (CA) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have announced on Tuesday that Australia would tour Pakistan in April-May 2009 and again in 2010. According to a press release, the PCB has also confirmed Pakistans tour of Australia in 2009-10 for three Tests, five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 International. The program has been agreed upon after Australias scheduled tour of Pakistan in March-April this year was postponed.  
	The 2009 tour of Pakistan will consist of five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 International following the Australian teams commitments in South Africa. Australia will then return to Pakistan in August-September 2010 to play three Test matches, with final dates and venues to be agreed depending on each nations Future Tours Program (FTP) obligations.         
	However, next years edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) runs the risk of missing players from Australia and Pakistan owing to this series.         
	CA operations manager Michael Brown made it clear that the Future Tours Program would prevail over the IPL. The bread and butter of cricket is based around the FTP and we need to make sure thats protected, Brown said.         
	Lords may play a part         
	 London: England may not have much of a representation in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as of now but the home of cricket, the Lords, could play host to the grand finale of the cash-rich ventures international tourney  the Champions League. The IPL organisers are reportedly in talks with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to arrange for the final at Lords this September, according to a report in a local newspaper. The international version of the IPL will feature the top two teams from the IPL and the leading sides from England, Australia, South Africa and Pakistans own domestic twenty20 competitions. Dubai is also one of the likely venues to organise the final but since the ground is not likely to be ready in time, the hosting rights could well go to the Lords. But ECB officials have chosen to keep mum for the time being. Not so fast, not so fast! a senior ECB representative was quoted as saying.         
	Chandhok wary of IPL         
	 New Delhi: Karun Chandhok fears the growing popularity of cricket through the Indian Premier League (IPL) will make it more difficult for other sports to compete for sponsorship and attention. Cricket has made itself into a fantastic marketing property which is unmatched by anything except Bollywood in India. Now they have IPL which is a fantastic idea and going to take things to a whole new level and makes it difficult for any of us in other sports to raise the sponsorship we need, Chandhok said. Chandhok himself could not stay untouched by the glamour of IPL and is supporting Mahendra Singh Dhonis Chennai Super Kings.

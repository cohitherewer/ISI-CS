	 Sehwag also (5-104) recorded his best bowling figures in Test cricket. His previous best was 3-12 vs South Africa in Kanpur in 2007-08. He also bettered his previous best first-class figures of 4-32, which was for North Zone vs South Zone in Mumbai in 1998.         
	 This innings also saw Sehwag bowling the maximum number of overs in a single innings of a Test so far. He had bowled 30-9-48-1 vs West Indies at Gros Islet in 2006.         
	 Virender Sehwag (1195 runs) has now become the highest run-scorer in this calendar year. He went past South African Graeme Smith, who has 1178 runs in the year so far.         
	 Australia (577) registered their highest score on Indian soil. The previous highest was 574/7 in Chennai in 1986-87. In fact, the only 600-plus total Australia have in the subcontinent is 617 vs Pak in Faisalabad in 1979-80.         
	 On 469, Australia bettered their previous highest score at the Kotla. In 1959-60, Australia had made 468.         
	 By batting for 179.3 overs, Australia fell just three balls short of the longest they have ever batted on Indian soil. Australia had batted for 180 overs at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai in 1956-57.         
	 The partnership of 106 between Clarke and Cameron White is now the best on Indian soil for the seventh wicket. The previous best was 64 by Tom Veivers and John Martin in the then Madras (Corp) in 1964-65.         
	 Clarke became the first Australian to score a hundred at the Kotla since Ian Chappell scored 138 in 1969-70. In fact, no visiting player has scored a hundred on this ground since Zimbabwes Andy Flower scored 183* in 2000-01.

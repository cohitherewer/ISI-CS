                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Nine line up for Sundays Mysore Derby 
            SRIMAX      
	Mysore: Nine horses have accepted to run the Sundays Classic, the 2,000m Poonawalla Derby but only four of them  Archipenko, Star Presentation, Palazzios Sun and Star Wave  merit attention.          
	Ignore Archipenkos last run. The R. Byramji-ward had pulled up lame in his last start to do anything worthwhile. Earlier the horse had placed second to the Set Alight.          
	Star Presentation is looking very fit but Archipenko had beaten trainer S. Ganapathys Golconda Derby Winner in their earlier clash.          
	S. Padmanabhan-trained Pala-zzios Sun has been well tuned for the event. The colt has improved a lot since his second to Fantastic Quest.          
	Star Wave, also from Ganapathys yard (Placerville-La Bonne Vie), is the winner of the Mysore 1000 Guineas. She is bred to stay. A close contest is expected in the Derby and the most desrving of all may walk away with the winners purse of about Rs 31 lakh.          
	Races postponed: Saturdays Mysore races have been postponed to Monday.

	Kazan (Russia): Indian womens dreams of making it to Beijing ended after a humiliating 0-4 loss to the US in the qualifying tournament here on Thursday.         
	After three consecutive losses in four matches, India can now only aim to finish third in the six-nation event. India, who have only managed to defeat Russia on the opening day, will take on France in their last pool match on Saturday.         
	After an impressive first half, the Indian defence came crashing down in the second, leaving the American forwards a free hand.         
	Jesse Gey opened the scoring in the 29th minute, followed by Kelly Doton (38th), Angela Loy (45th) and Carrie Lingo (48th).         
	India got two penalty corners late in the proceedings which were frittered away.         
	India has always been a dangerous side. We knew we have to play our best game, said US coach Lee Bodimeade. The scoreboard does not reflect the true game on the turf.         
	India coach M. K. Kaushik said, We played our best, but they could open up the flanks, make the right tackles while we failed in the attack.         
	Earlier in the day, Belgium defeated the fighting Netherlands Antilles 3-2.           (PTI)

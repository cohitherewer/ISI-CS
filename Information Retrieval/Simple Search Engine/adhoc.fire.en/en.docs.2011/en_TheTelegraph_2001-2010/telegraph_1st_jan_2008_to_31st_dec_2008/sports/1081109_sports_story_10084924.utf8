	Calcutta: United SC returned to winning ways beating city rivals Mohammedan Sporting 1-0 in their seventh round ONGC I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday evening.         
	Man of the Match Gauranga Dutta scored the only goal of the match in the 61st minute with a brilliant left-footer, thus avenging their two losses in the Premier Division meetings.         
	It was actually a Subhasish Roy Chowdhury move from the left that led to the goal. Latching on to a harmless ball in the mid-field, Subhasish surged past a couple of defenders before chipping it for Subair Murithala Ali, who chested it down for the unmarked Gauranga Dutta in the top-box.         
	The veteran Gauranga placed it past the advancing Mohammedan Sporting custodian Tharangachan Tungshan into the far corner to score.         
	Victory placed Subrata Bhattacharjees side sixth on the I-League table above Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting, and one place beneath East Bengal. They now have eight points from seven outings.         
	Unlike their earlier performances, Shabbir Alis men on Saturday appeared to have lost the plot in the initial minutes.         
	A listless defence and a lacklustre mid-field gave United SC the upper hand.         
	United SC, however, squandered an opportunity to take an early lead when Murithala missed a sitter when he failed to nick in a Subhasish cross.         
	The substitutions made by Shabbir Ali after the change of ends  Vimal Pariyar for Mir Farooq Hyder, Lalhariatzuala Tezoka for Sovan Chakraborty and A. Jyothi Kumar for Goutam Thakur  made little difference.         
	Mohammedan Sporting pushed forward looking for a way back into the match but Shabbir Alis most trusted duo  Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday  lacked their usual magical finish.         
	In the 85th minute a collective effort ended up going nowhere when a brilliant Adewusi Adebao effort hit the cross piece.         
	United SC coach Subrata Bhattacharjee, after the match, said: I am happy with the performance of my boys. These three points are very important But we still have a long way to go. Today we stuck to what we planned and got the result.

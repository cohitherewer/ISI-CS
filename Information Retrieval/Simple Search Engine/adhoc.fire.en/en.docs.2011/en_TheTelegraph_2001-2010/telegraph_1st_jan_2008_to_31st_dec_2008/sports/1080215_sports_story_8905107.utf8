The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aiyar: BAI should have come to us earlier
                                                   Aiyar: BAI should have come to us earlier
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyar on Thursday told national sports federations to first do their jobs properly before blaming anything on his ministry.         
	The sports federations job is not to sit back and play a blame game. They should be more pro-active, Aiyar said on Thursday. I dont like this job but as long as I am here, I will run this show properly.         
	Using as an example the recent controversy over the shortage of shuttlecocks that led to the cancellation of the national badminton camp in Goa, the minister said he shouldve been told about the problem in time.         
	If there was a ban on the import of shuttlecocks from a particular country because of avian flu, BAI should have alerted us earlier. Instead, they woke up on the last day and cancelled the camp. If they had informed us earlier, we would have imported the shuttlecocks from other places.         
	When asked why his ministry was not giving ammunition to Olympic-bound shooters, Aiyar said that under the new SAI rules the National Rifle Association of India was to buy the ammunition and that it would be later reimbursed by the ministry.         
	NRAI president Digvijay Singh is a veteran parliamentarian. Dont tell me he doesnt know the rules? asked Aiyar.         
	The sports ministry and the IOA will once again meet on February 29 to discuss the proposed sports policy to set up a regulatory body to keep tabs on the sports federations.         
	The ministry is not trying to sabotage anything. I hope there is better co-ordination between us (SAI, the ministry and federations). You can come (to the meeting) with your cameras. I can assure you there will be no fisticuffs. The meeting will be held in a civilised manner, he said.

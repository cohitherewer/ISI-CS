                                                                                                                                                                                                     Md. Sp.   go down tamely
                            
	Margao: Man of the Match Junior Obagbemiros second-half brace guided Sporting Clube de Goa to an emphatic 3-0 win over Mohammedan Sporting in the second round of the ONGC I-League here Saturday.         
	After a barren first half, Sporting Clube got their goals through Obagbemiro (62nd, 76th) and Micky Fernandes (75th).         
	Sporting Clube de Goa now have six points from two matches while Mohammedan Sporting remain on one point from two matches after this defeat.         
	Sporting Clube played an organised game, were more thrustful in their attack, and had a couple of clear chances to take a lead in the first half, but Joseph Pereira and Junior Obagbemiro failed to capitalise.         
	Juniors powerful shot was saved by rival keeper Naseem Akhtar in the 19th minute.         
	Mohammedan Sporting failed to function as a team. Striker Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday who were kept quiet by the rival defenders stitched a nice move towards the end of the first half but the formers shot deflected a rival defenders hand before hitting the post and going out for a corner.         
	Sporting Clube de Goa continued to dictate terms in the second half. They brought in Anthony Dsouza in place of Joychandra Singh. That added teeth to their attack and Sporting took the lead in the 62nd minute.         
	Following a flag kick on the left, Joseph Pereira played a short pass to Wilton Gomes who in turn send a floated the ball into the box for Junior who headed in.         
	The goal put the rival defence in disarray and Mohammedan conceded the second goal in the 75th minute when Micky Fernandes ran a solo from the middle, dodged a host of rival defenders before placing the ball into the net.         
	A minute later Junior decided the issue in favour of Sporting Clube  he notched his second goal when he chipped the ball over onrushing keeper Naseem Akhtar to put the match beyond the reach of Mohammedan Sporting.         
	Sporting Clube de Goa coach Vishwas Gaunkar was happy the way his boys played against the Calcutta club. They clicked well and scored goals in the second after missing good scoring chances in the first half, he said.         
	While Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali was disappointed with his teams performance as they failed to combine as a team. The rival team played well and they deserve to win. We will try to play better in our next match, Ali said. (PTI)

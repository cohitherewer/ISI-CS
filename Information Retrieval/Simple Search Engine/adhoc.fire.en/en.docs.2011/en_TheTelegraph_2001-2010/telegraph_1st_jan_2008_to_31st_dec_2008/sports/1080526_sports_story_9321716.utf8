	Calcutta: Ottmar Hitzfeld couldnt believe his ears. The legendary Bayern Munich coach, who arrived with the team on Sunday, was surprised to know that Chelsea have sacked their coach Avram Grant, three days after losing the Champions League final in a tie-breaker.         
	Its a news to me, Hitzfeld, who received similar treatment from Bayern in 2004, said. I always feel sad when a colleague loses his job. It is quite funny. I never expected somebody to get sacked after losing a penalty shoot out.         
	Bayern manager Uli Hoeness also made his displeasure clear about the new Chelsea management with Roman Abramovich at their head.         
	Asked why Bayern havent enjoyed as much success as Manchester United or Chelsea, the member of the 1974 World Cup winning team said his club have no plan to go overboard like the two English clubs.         
	We have a good team and a good management and we have been doing fairly well in Europe, he said.         
	Both Manchester United and Chelsea have huge debts in the market. We dont want to get into the kind of rat races they are in. We may not have anyone like Roman Abramovich but we are happy the way we are going about.         
	Hitzfeld, who like Oliver Kahn, would be sitting on the Bayern technical bench for the last time on Tuesday against Mohun Bagan, said he has no regret for quitting the Bavarian giants.         
	I am going to take over the national team of Switzerland. The pressure there may not be as much as it is in Bayern, but thats a prestigious job. I shall be proud of my new assignment.

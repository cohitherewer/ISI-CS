    - After daylong drama, focus is back on derby           A STAFF REPORTER            The drama over the derby refused to spoil the players mood on Thursday. East Bengals Sunil Chhetri, Nirmal Chhetri and Mehrajuddin Wadoo (above) sweated it out at their club ground while (picture right, from left) Mohun Bagans Rakesh Masih, Jose Ramirez Barreto and James Singh (jr) were a study in concentration.

	Calcutta: Better late than never  the oft used proverb probably describes Thursdays situation best, a day before the crucial Sahara CFL Premier Division match between archrivals Mohun Bagan and East Bengal.         
	After a daylong drama (with barely 20 hours left before the kick-off), Bagan finally announced their decision to take part in the derby after a fax from the Indian Football Association (IFA) reached the club in the evening.         
	The IFA secretary acknowledged Bagans concerns about not playing the final at the same time as that of Mohammedan Sporting but requested them to take part in Fridays derby keeping in mind the associations limited infrastructure.         
	Defending champions Bagan need at least a point from Fridays match to assure themselves of the local league title. A loss (by whatever margin) against East Bengal might prove to be a disaster for the green-and-maroon club especially since second placed Mohammedan Sporting managed to reduce the goal difference considerably in their last match against Calcutta Port Trust.         
	The footballers of both clubs  East Bengal and Mohun Bagan  were throughout inquisitive about the fate of the derby and the officials probably did little to help them keep focus before the all-important tie.         
	Both teams, however, went through the routines.         
	Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa sounded irritated with the fiasco surrounding the tie.         
	Its very important to know The preparation is not the same before the match day and two-three days before a match. However, I have prepared keeping in mind that the match is on Bencharifa said after his teams practice.         
	With Mohammedan Sporting snapping at their heels, Bagan suffered yet another setback at Thursdays practice when Peter Odafe, their main man in defence, suffered a groin injury. An already depleted Bagan defence, with Habibur Rehman Mondal also out with an injury, will have a tough time to keep an East Bengal attack comprised of Sunil Chhetri and Ashim Biswas at bay.         
	Odafes injury doesnt look good. Its not in our control We will have to wait and see, Bencharifa said.         
	Deepak Mondal, part of the national teams back four, also skipped practice complaining of back pain and fever. Bhaichung Bhutia, the national football team captain and the cynosure off all eyes at the Bagan practice, underwent light training.         
	Coach Bencharifa has kept Bhutia in the probable 18, but whether he will feature in the starting XI will be decided only on Friday.         
	The red-and-gold brigade practised for about an hour-and-half in the morning. Coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee also sounded unhappy with the controversy surrounding the match.         
	Its a prestige match for us. I have never seen in my life that the derby match has been postponed a day before the match. The club has told us nothing yet, he said after his teams practice.         
	East Bengal will also be without Jayanta Sen and Rennedy Singh in Fridays match. Dharamjit Singh, who took part in the full practice session, is also not fully fit.

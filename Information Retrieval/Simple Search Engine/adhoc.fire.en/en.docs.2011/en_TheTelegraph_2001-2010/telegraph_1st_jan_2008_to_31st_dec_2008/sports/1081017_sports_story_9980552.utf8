The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Even 15 weighs heavy, but cynosure Sachin is relaxed 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Even 15 weighs heavy, but cynosure Sachin is relaxed 
    - Its all about getting past Brian Laras world record             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Chandigarh: Believe it or not, it took Sachin Tendulkar exactly a year to move from the record-equalling 34th Test hundred to the record-creating 35th. That was in the 2004-2005 period. Right now, its taking him ages to get past Brian Laras 11,953.         
	Crickets senior-most pro began the season (in Sri Lanka) 171 short of the West Indies phenomenon. After four Tests, hes still 15 away from scripting arguably the most cherished record for any batsman  highest run-getter in Tests.         
	Yet, Sachin looked pretty relaxed in the lead-up to the second Test against Australia, in neighbouring Mohali, from Friday.         
	While the stalwart declined to take questions, somebody very close to him told The Telegraph: Look, everyone is asking just one thing  when will the record be created? Even if Sachin doesnt want to think of those 15 runs, he has no choice given that nobody has anything else to talk of...         
	The person added: Whats irritating, at times, is that even some of those who know him well are asking the same question... Surely, Sachin is human and could get affected.         
	With the Sachin factor, so to say, at play, the Punjab Cricket Association expects a handsome turn out at the model stadium which has a capacity of just under 30,000.         
	Incidentally, as part of its drive to encourage the sport, the Inderjit Singh Bindra-headed association has given 5,000 (season) complimentaries to the state government. Those are for the exclusive use of schoolchildren from the districts.         
	The (season) tickets have been priced from Rs 150 upwards and, that, youll agree is very reasonable, remarked the associations joint secretary, G.S.Walia.         
	It would be difficult to argue with that.         
	Meanwhile, there could be a change in plan but, for now, nobody from Sachins family is scheduled to watch the Test in person. That, perhaps, is one way of limiting the pressure somewhat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wigan out of danger zone
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wigan out of danger zone
                      
	London: The relegation zone merry-go-round continued when Wigan Athletic beat Everton 1-0 to climb out of the bottom three on Monday.         
	Henri Camara shot in from close range after being set up by Antonio Valencia in the 51st minute before Tim Cahill wasted a glorious late chance to earn Everton a point.         
	Wigans second home win of the season lifted them to 15th in the Premier League with 16 points from 14 games, three points behind seventh-placed Everton.         
	Newcastle United, on 14 points after a 0-0 draw at leaders Chelsea on Saturday, dropped back into the relegation places. (REUTERS)

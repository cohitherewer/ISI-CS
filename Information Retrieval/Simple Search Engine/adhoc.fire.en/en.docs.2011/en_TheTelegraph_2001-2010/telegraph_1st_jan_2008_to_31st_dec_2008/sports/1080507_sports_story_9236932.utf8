The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Kings lose again
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Super Kings lose again
                      
	Chennai: Stand-in skipper Adam Gilchrist led by example as bottom-placed Deccan Chargers humbled Chennai Super Kings by seven wickets with two overs to spare for their second win in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) on Tuesday night.         
	After Tuesdays loss, the Chennai outfit, who were the one-time leaders, stay at fourth place on the table with eight points from seven matches, winning four and losing three.         
	Rajasthan Royals are the leaders with 10 points while Deccan Chargers are in the sixth spot with four.         
	Chasing 145, Deccan Chargers cantered to 148 for three in 18 overs with Scott Styris (36 not out), Rohit Sharma (23) and Shahid Afridi (20 not out) making impressions with the bat.         
	Leading the side in absence of injured regular skipper V.V.S. Laxman, Gilchrist after winning the toss, marshalled his bowlers well before top-scoring with a 36-ball 54 to guide the team to a morale boosting win.         
	Earlier they did well to restrict the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led Super Kings for a modest 144 for seven wickets.         
	However, in their chase they lost Herschelle Gibbs (10) early. But former Aussie wicketkeeper Gilchrist, batting with a squash ball inside his gloves, looked in tremendous hurry as he went after the Chennai bowlers.         
	Proteas spearhead Makhaya Ntini bore the brunt of his wrath in the sixth over when the left-hander hit him for a couple of sixes, with a boundary sandwiched in between.

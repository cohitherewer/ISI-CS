The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Night ties unsafe in Pak, says Abbas
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Night ties unsafe in Pak, says Abbas
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas has advised his countrys government and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to discourage night cricket matches in the country because of the prevailing security situation.         
	The former Test skipper made the suggestion at a meeting of the Sports Ministry to discuss the cricket affairs.         
	Well, my views are simple and I have said that night cricket these days is not advisable because of the security problem, Zaheer said.         
	My viewpoint is that in the prevailing circumstances God forbid something happens in these night matches it will lead to lot of chaos which would be bad for Pakistan cricket as teams are already not willing to come here, he said.         
	Zaheer pointed out that one needs to be cautious in these times and cricket grounds where night matches are being played are not very secure.         
	Im just worried that we dont give the other teams more excuse for not coming to Pakistan. If something happens it will be very difficult for the Board to convince teams to come, he added.         
	 Zaheer also said he did not see the Australians staying in India if any more bomb blasts occurred.         
	The security that has been provided to the Australians now appears to have satisfied them, however actually they are very much concerned about the blasts in Delhi and I think if such an incident is repeated they will leave the place, he said.

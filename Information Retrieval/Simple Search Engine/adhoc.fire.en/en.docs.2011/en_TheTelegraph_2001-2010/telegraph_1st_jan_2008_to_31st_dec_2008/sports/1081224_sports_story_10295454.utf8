                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kevin: Yuvi is very special 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: England captain Kevin Pietersen, who called Yuvraj Singh a pie-chucker a couple of days ago, turned a great admirer of the Punjab batsman on Tuesday.         
	The man (Yuvraj Singh) is one of the cleanest strikers of the ball in world cricket. The sixes this man hits, leaves me dumbfounded. He is a very special cricketer, is how Pietersen described the Indian left-hander at the end of the Test series against India.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On positives from the Test series defeat         
	It was not as bad as some other defeats. We can take a lot of positives from this series.India are a great side and played fantastic cricket, real confident cricket. They are on top of their game especially in India but we gave ourselves good chance in Chennai. In this fixture, we fell a bit short So, not so many negatives but felt great to be back in India.         
	Whether it should have been a three-Test series         
	Three Tests are always ideal. But thats the schedule we have got and thats the schedule we had to deal with.         
	His captaincy         
	Captaincy of any nation and in any sport is not an easy job. Last two months have been pretty difficult. It was the toughest 6-8 weeks of my career so far To score a 100 like I did yesterday means a lot to me.         
	On Yuvraj Singh         
	Its been fun really. At the end of the day, we are strong characters playing for our country. A bit of joke and fun doesnt do any harm At the end of the day you shake hands and I told him what a fantastic innings he played. The man is one of the cleanest strikers of the ball in world cricket. The sixes this man hits, leaves me dumbfounded. He is a very special cricketer Sometimes you have bit of red mist and you have a bit of an argument But thats all done and dusted Gave you guys something to write about didnt it?

	Margao: Sporting continued to keep their winning momentum going as they overcame stiff challenge from JCT to win 2-1 in their I-League encounter at the Nehru stadium here Sunday. They thus remain at the top of the table after the first leg matches.         
	Both the goals for Sporting were scored by Junior Obagbemiro (29th, 47th). While JCT, who held more of the exchanges and had better possession, reduced the margin in the 56th minute through Jagpreet Singh.         
	JCT started well, moving the ball with quick short passes followed by long over-head passes to unsettle the rival defence.         
	They had their share of chances in the first half but Eduardo failed to direct the ball on target off a cross from Balwant Singh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Steve: Motts the one to watch out for
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Steve: Motts the one to watch out for
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Matthew Mott                           
	Calcutta: Usually, players whove themselves made a huge mark pick players of the future. The other day, Steve Waugh chose to talk about Matthew Mott, the Kolkata Knight Riders assistant coach.         
	The team has slumped in the Indian Premier League, but these are still very early days for most involved with Twenty20 cricket.         
	Matthew is the one to watch out for I see him making it really big and, so, keep following his career, Steve, a living legend, told The Telegraph.         
	Asked what set Mott apart from others of his breed, Steve replied: His man management skills Hes really special there         
	Mott, who has been hand-picked by the Knight Riders coach, John Buchanan, guided New South Wales to the Pura Cup (formerly the Sheffield Shield) title earlier this year.         
	Buchanan, who needs no introduction, is widely respected for having an astute eye. And thats not been limited to choosing players only.         
	Few, perhaps, know that Mott was a pretty competent left-handed batsman and has a first-class double hundred to his credit. He has played for Queensland and Victoria.         
	With the Waughs and the Buchanans rating Mott so highly, it wont surprise if the 34-year-old eventually gets to coach Team Australia.         
	Mott has already been associated with the Australian colts.

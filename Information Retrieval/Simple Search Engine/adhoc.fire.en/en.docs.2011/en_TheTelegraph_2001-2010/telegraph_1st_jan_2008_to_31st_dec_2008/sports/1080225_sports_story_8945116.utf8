                                                   Looking forward to playing under Sourav: Ponting
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sydney: Ricky Ponting on Sunday said that the victory would give them the psychological edge ahead of the finals. He also said he was looking forward to playing under Sourav Ganguly in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The following are excerpts         
	The close finish         
	We had nothing to lose and our bowlers werent under pressure for the first time. Weve got some work to do though in our next match in Melbourne but we are pretty happy with our performance. I thought we always had the game under control but it is a bit worrying. Maybe we were a bit complacent when India were four wickets down. And our bowling was a little bit short tonight.         
	His innings         
	Its been a while its been a long time coming. Its good to get some runs on that wicket which has been the best we have had so far in the series as the scores indicate. I was a bit positive and a bit more aggressive today. Its good for us three (Mathew Hayden and Andrew Symonds being the other two) to be among the runs.         
	Gautam Gambhirs innings         
	Gambhir was outstanding, once he settled down it was easy for him. He sort of worked the ball around and got a lot of runs down the third man area. He picked the gaps and ran well between the wickets. It was an impressive innings. It was a very good wicket to bat on too.         
	The Mahendra Singh Dhoni gloves affair         
	I am aware of it. At one stage he had a white pair on and the next moment he had a blue one. He changes his gloves a lot and sometimes he uses different gloves when he is standing up or behind the stumps.         
	The IPL         
	I wish I had made this century a couple of weeks ago and landed with a better deal in the IPL. But its not in my hands. I am looking forward to going down there and playing for Calcutta Playing under an Australian coach (John Buchanan) and Sourav Ganguly.

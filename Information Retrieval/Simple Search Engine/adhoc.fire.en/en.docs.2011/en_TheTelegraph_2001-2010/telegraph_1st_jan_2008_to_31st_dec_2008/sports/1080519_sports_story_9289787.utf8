                                                                                                                                                                                           Jankovic wins Italian Open
                      
	Rome: Jelena Jankovic defeated French qualifier Alize Cornet 6-2, 6-2 on Sunday to win her second straight Italian Open.         
	The fourth-seeded Serb took early control of the match against her 18-year-old rival.         
	She produced solid ground strokes and was supported by her Cornets unforced errors.         
	In the second set, the Serb was leading 4-1 when she called the trainer to look at her right shoulder.         
	Jankovic lost the following match - the first time in the game, Cornet held serve , but went on to win the match as she held serve and then broke her opponent to love.         
	For Cornet, it was an emotional match. Unable to produce her best shots and converting only three out of 12 break points, the French woman broke into tears in her corner during a changeover in the second set.         
	At the end of the game, she was still fighting back the tears.         
	Cornet was the first female qualifier to reach the final at the Foro Italico in the Open Era.         
	Before Cornet, the only other qualifier to reach the final in Rome was Alberto Mancini, who had to retire against Emilio Sanchez in 1991.           (AP)

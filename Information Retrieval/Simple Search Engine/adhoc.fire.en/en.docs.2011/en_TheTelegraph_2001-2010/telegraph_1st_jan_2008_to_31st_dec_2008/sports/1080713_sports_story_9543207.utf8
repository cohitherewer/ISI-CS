The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev up to tied 8th 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeev up to tied 8th 
                  Second round leader Angel Cabrera                     
	Glasgow: Jeev Milkha Singh brought home a second successive card of three-under 68 to jump 11 places and grab a share of the eighth spot even as S.S.P. Chowrasia and Shiv Kapur missed the cut after the second round of the $5.92 million Barclays Scottish Open.         
	Jeev sank in three birdies against two bogeys to continue his march towards a top-five finish, which will make him eligible to compete at the British Open.         
	However, curtains were drawn on the campaigns of Chowrasia (70) and Kapur (72) after average performances in the second round at Loch Lomond Golf Club here.         
	Chowrasia ended tied 82nd with an aggregate of even-par 142, missing the cut by two strokes.         
	Kapur missed the cut by three strokes after carding a one-over 71 for a total of one-over 143, which placed him tied 91.         
	For Jeev, a bogey free back nine studded with two birdies (10th and 13th) did the trick after a disappointing front nine that started with a birdie-bogey on the first and second holes. He did picked up a stroke on the fifth but bogeyed the next hole.         
	Argentine Angel Cabrera (68) grabbed a one-stroke lead with a total of nine-under 133.           (PTI)

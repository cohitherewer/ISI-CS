The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diwakar puts India in final 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Diwakar puts India in final 
                      
	Hyderabad: Star drag-flicker Diwakar Ram fashioned Indias emphatic 3-1 win over Pakistan with a spectacular brace as the hosts stormed into the 6th Junior Asia Cup final after a violence-marred semi-final here today.         
	After Gurwinder Singh Chandi opened Indias account in the 15th minute, Diwakar came up with twin second half strikes to take the game away from Pakistan.         
	In between, Kashif Ali (42nd) reduced the margin for the visitors but in the end, it was just not enough.         
	India withstood Pakistans early onslaught before taking control of the proceedings and Chandi scored an exceptional goal through a reverse flick to put India in the lead in the 15th minute.         
	The match, however, took an ugly turn in the 31st when a scuffle broke out among the players following a brawl between Pakistans Muhammad Irfan and Chandi.         
	Soon after resumption, Diwakar scored from a penalty corner to make it 2-0 but the Pakistanis refused to throw in the towel.         
	Kashif reduced one by converting a penalty corner in the 42nd minute but Diwakar rose to the occasion again on the 47th minute, sounding the board from Indias third penalty corner.         
	India coach A. K. Bansal heaped praise on Diwakar. He is our saviour and has been delivering in the crucial matches.         
	And now the win against Pakistan doubles our enthusiasm. We played as a team which was lacking for the past three matches, he said.         
	Bansal said that the first goal was turning point of the game. After the first goal, the Pakistanis got a bit slowed down and our boys got over them.         
	Pakistan coach Jahangir Butt said, as far as our strategy was concerned it was going on as per plans but the boys made some mistakes during the match.         
	Meanwhile, South Korea thrashed Japan 4-2 in the second semi-final to set up a title clash against India.           (AGENCIES)

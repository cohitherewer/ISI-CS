                                                                                                                                                                                                     3 city teams scratched 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In a shocking development on Sunday, three major Calcutta teams were scratched out from the Manchester United Premier Cup (MUPC) in Gangtok for fielding over-aged players.         
	According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, out of the four Calcutta teams in the fray, only Kalyani Municipality XI have been allowed to participate in the East Zone qualifiers.         
	We have scratched Mohun Bagan, Mohammedan Sporting and United SC after three or more players from all these teams were found to be over-age in the medical examination, said a member of the organising committee.         
	Last year, East Bengal were scratched from the final rounds in Goa for a similar offence. The club were put under suspension and were barred from taking part this season.         
	The MUPC tournament for under-14 boys is considered to be one of the most prestigious age group meets in the country. The winners of the tournament qualify for the Asian rounds. Mohun Bagan and East Bengal qualified twice for the Final Rounds in London.         
	An organising committee member said that out of the eight teams in the fray, five teams have been scratched out for fielding over age players.         
	We are now left with only three teams and will play the tournament in the double leg round robin basis, he said.

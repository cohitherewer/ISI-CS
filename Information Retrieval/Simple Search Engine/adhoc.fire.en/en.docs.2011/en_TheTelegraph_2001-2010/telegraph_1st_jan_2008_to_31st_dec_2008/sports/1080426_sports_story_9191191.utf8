The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kepler: Weve a plan for everyone
                                                                                                                                                                                           Kepler: Weve a plan for everyone
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Kepler Wessels feels every match in the IPL is crucial. The Chennai Super Kings coach doesnt wish to pick Saturdays match against Kolkata Knight Riders for special mention. At the match-eve news conference, he said a total of around 200 should be tough enough for the opposition.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His assessment of Kolkata Knight Riders         
	They are well balanced and a dangerous outfit. Weve got plans for each of them and need to execute it properly.         
	Ishant Sharmas bowling         
	He has been doing well since the tour Down Under. How we play him depends on the conditions and the situation.         
	The areas Chennai Super Kings need to improve on         
	Our bowling needs improvement at the death. Its been pretty disappointing except for Muralidharan.         
	Saturdays match         
	These are early days. Each of the 14 league matches in the preliminary stage is crucial. It is too early to say whether this is a big match but for us each game is crucial. They are all big and tough encounters.         
	A safe target         
	A total around 200 should be considered a tough chase. Anything above that will be a bonus.         
	The home advantage         
	Were a good side at home. But in Twenty20 cricket, its 50-50 all the time. All it takes is a couple of individual performances to tilt the scales.         
	Whether the absence of Matthew Hayden and Michael Hussey would be a big blow         
	They will be available till our game against Bangalore Royal Challengers next week. Anyway, their absence would be sufficiently filled up with the arrival of South Africans Makhaya Ntini and Albie Morkel.

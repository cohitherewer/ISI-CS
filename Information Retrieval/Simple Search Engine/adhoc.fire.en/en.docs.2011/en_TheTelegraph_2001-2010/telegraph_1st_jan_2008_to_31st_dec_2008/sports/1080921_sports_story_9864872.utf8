The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting backs Watson to make Test return
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ponting backs Watson to make Test return
  - Young allrounder an ideal replacement for Symonds, feels captain               Shane Watson                           
	Melbourne: Australia skipper Ricky Ponting feels Shane Watson is the best possible replacement for sacked allrounder Andrew Symonds and has backed him to be in the playing XI during next months Test series against India.         
	Him (Watson) for Symonds is probably the absolutely likely swap at the moment, Ponting was quoted as saying by an Australian daily on the eve of the teams departure to India for the four-match Test series.         
	Ponting feels Watsons allround ability may have helped him win a place in the side even if Symonds was around.         
	I think he might have played anyway if Symonds was around just for that flexibility and what his bowling can offer, the captain said.         
	I would be surprised if he doesnt play in the opening game.         
	It was Watsons spate of injuries that had opened the door for Symonds to establish himself in the Test side and now Symonds sacking for indiscipline has presented Watson the chance to do the same. Watson has played just three Tests, the last in November 2005 against The West Indies.         
	Hes been pretty harshly viewed in recent years but you dont average almost 50 in first-class cricket, particularly batting at the Gabba, if you havent got the right game.         
	He could get himself picked in the side as a batter alone, but what he can give us with the ball is a bonus, Ponting added.         
	The retirements of Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill mean Australia will have to bank on uncapped spinners Bryce McGain and Jason Krejza on Indias turning tracks and that could see Watson playing a larger role, feels Ponting.         
	It will be tough but Im pretty excited about it, he said about using his untried spinners.         
	They are very different spinners but at the same time they could complement each other really well if we happen to play both in the same side.         
	Ponting lauded McGains performance during Australia As tour of India. He also spoke highly of Krejza.         
	Hes (Krejza) always impressed me from the time I first saw him at the academy five or six years ago, Ponting said.         
	Ive been talking about him quietly for a long time because what I see with him is what a lot of other off-spinners dont have, the ability to turn the ball really big. He puts more work on the ball than probably any off-spinner Ive seen.         
	The 36-year-old McGain sustained injury to his upper arm during the India trip and met Australias physiotherapist Alex Kountouris for a last-minute assessment. (PTI)

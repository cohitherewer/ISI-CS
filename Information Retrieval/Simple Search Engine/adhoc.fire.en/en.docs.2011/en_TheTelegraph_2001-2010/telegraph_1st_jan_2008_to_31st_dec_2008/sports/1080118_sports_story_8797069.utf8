                                                   We didnt play well: Gilchrist

           
	Perth: Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist said Indian bowlers on Thursday went about their job cleverly but insisted his team could still claw back into the match with three days to spare in the third Test here. 
    
	They used the wind really well and they were very clever in how they went about (bowling) in partnerships, said Gilchrist after stumps on Day II. 
    
	Gilchrist said the hosts have set their priority on wrapping up the Indian innings as soon as possible. 
    
	Presently India have done a better job. They applied themselves better in batting and maintained the pressure with the ball. (Now) getting the nine wickets is our priority. 
    
	The Australian vice-captain admitted the hosts had thrown away the initiative. 
    
	We didnt play well And handed it back to them. We nicked everything. They bowled enough balls in the right area and didnt play the right shots, he said. 
    
	Gilchrist praised Rudra Pratap Singh, who picked four for 68 on the second day, for his performance. 
    
	There was a little momentum going my way but Rudra Pratap produced the beauty and I nicked it, he said.

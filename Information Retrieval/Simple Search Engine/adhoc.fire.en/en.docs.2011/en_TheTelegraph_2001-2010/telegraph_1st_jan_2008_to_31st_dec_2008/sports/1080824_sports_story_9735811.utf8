	Valencia: Ferraris Felipe Massa put his Hungarian nightmare behind him on Saturday by beating title rival Lewis Hamilton to pole position at the European Grand Prix.         
	The 27-year-old Brazilian mastered Formula Ones newest street circuit with a lap of 1:38.989 seconds to chalk up his fourth pole of the season and 13th of his career.         
	His performance, in the dying seconds of an unpredictable qualifying session, pushed McLarens championship leader Hamilton off the top spot and into second place.         
	Massa might have been leading the championship but is instead third, eight points behind Hamilton, after an engine failure forced him to retire from the Hungarian Grand Prix.

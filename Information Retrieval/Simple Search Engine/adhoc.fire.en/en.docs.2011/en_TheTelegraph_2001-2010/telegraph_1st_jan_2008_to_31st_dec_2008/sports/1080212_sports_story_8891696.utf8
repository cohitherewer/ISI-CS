	Electing to bat, the English side lost opener Michael Carberry in the second over after he was trapped by Gujarat left-arm pacer Ashraf Makda.         
	After a 50-run second-wicket partnership with Joe Denly (32), Yardy put up another 75-run stand with Ed Joyce (32). While Denly was run out by Siddharth Trivedi, Joyce was caught lbw by Makda.         
	Then came Jonathan Trott (44) and put on 141-runs with Yardy for the fourth wicket.         
	With three overs left to finish off the days proceedings, Makdas got his third victim trapping Trott on the wrong foot.         
	Nightwatchman Graham Onions and Yardy were at the crease when stumps were drawn.         
	Yardy hit 20 boundaries to reach his 12th first class century.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Verdict seems to be pre-decided: BCCI
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Verdict seems to be pre-decided: BCCI
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A peeved and rattled BCCI on Tuesday shot off a letter to ICC president David Morgan saying that the order of the Appeals Commissioner seems to be pre-decided as the same has been passed without affording the player an opportunity of a personal hearing.         
	The following are excerpts from the letter sent by BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan to Morgan:         
	I am in receipt of the order passed by the Appeals Commissioner in the appeal dated November 3 filed by Gautam Gambhir against the decision of the adjudicator imposing a one Test ban on him which has been upheld         
	I have to state that the said order of the Appeals Commissioner seems to be pre-decided as the same has been passed without affording the player an opportunity of a personal hearing. Gambhir had made a written request for a personal hearing, legal representation and had also requested for certain documents/recordings regarding the incident  audio/video footage of the incident, record of the hearing before the ICC Match Referee including the report lodged by the umpires and the video recording of the hearing.         
	The time granted under the rules to the player to file the appeal is 48 hours and Gambhir had within the said period requested for all of the above. None of the above documents/recordings had been provided to Gambhir nor had he been given opportunity of personal hearing or legal representation.         
	In view of the above, I submit that the decision/order of the Appeals Commissioner is void ab initio and non est as it contravenes mandatory provisions relating to hearing of appeals and also as being in violation of principles of natural justice.         
	It is submitted that while violating the rules of natural justice and denying the player the opportunity of oral hearing and legal representation and also denying him documents/recordings requested by him, the Appeals Commissioner has not given reasons for such denial         
	Being a cricketer and a layman and not being familiar with the legal implications of statements made by him, Gambhir would most certainly have benefited from an opportunity of personal hearing and legal representation. Assuming that the Appeals Commissioner has the discretion of granting opportunity of personal hearing and legal representation, the same ought to be exercised judiciously and judicially and if denied, valid reasons have to be given for such denial especially since there is no further appeal granted to the player under the rules. None of the above have been done in the present instance.         
	It is also further submitted that the Appeals Commissioner does not have the right to pre-decide the submissions which would have been made on behalf of Gambhir, which is what the Appeals Commissioner has done in the present case. Further, with regard to the urgency in hearing the appeal and in refusing the request for extension of time, it is submitted that no harm or damage would have been caused either to ICC or the other parties concerned if the request had been acceded to.         
	There was no urgency in deciding the appeal and if time was granted to Gambhir, the order of the adjudicator would have been maintained and the one Test ban retained, which could have been implemented at a later point of time. On the other hand, by deciding the appeal in a hurry without hearing the player, serious damage/prejudice has been caused to Gambhir as the order is a permanent blot on him which has the potential of damaging a bright and successful career. Thus, penalising the player without according to him a personal hearing causes serious prejudice to the player which cannot be remedied as no further appeal is provided under the rules.         
	It is therefore submitted that the order of the Appeals Commissioner is non est and ab initio void as being in violation of the mandatory provisions of the rules and/ or the principles of natural justice. Therefore, the Board of Control for Cricket in India does not accept the said decision of the Appeals Commissioner and objects to the same.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shabbir: We can still win it 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Shabbir: We can still win it 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Coach Shabbir Ali insisted on Sunday that the CFL Premier Division title is still within Mohammedan Sportings grasp.         
	The black and white brigade, who were ahead of the pack till recently, now find themselves sharing equal number of points with Mohun Bagan despite playing a match more. And Sundays 1-1 draw did precious little to break that deadlock.         
	Its still open. We still have a bright chance to wrap things up in style, Ali said after Sundays encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	We have easier opponents to face compared to East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, Ali said.         
	The Mohammedan Sporting coach, however, seemed annoyed with the below par refereeing.         
	It was clearly disappointing. He (the referee) had no clue and the game suffered because of his inefficiency, he said.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa, too, agreed with Ali. Poor refereeing kills the game, he said, adding but its part and parcel of the game.         
	The Moroccan said Jose Ramirez Barretos inclusion was a morale boost for his boys.         
	Mohun Bagan officials, meanwhile, have decided to write a letter to Indian Football Association secretary Utpal Ganguly demanding an outstation referee for the return-leg derby against East Bengal.

                                                   Thackeray: Stop gambling   by industrialists 
                            
	Mumbai: Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray dubbed the auctioning of cricketers by the Indian Premier League a gambling game of industrialists, asking BCCI chief Sharad Pawar to stop it.         
	In an open letter to Pawar, published on the front page of Fridays edition of Sena mouthpiece Samna, Thackeray said such open display of wealth didnt augur well for the Indian cricket.         
	Oh Pawar, what is happening in the realm of cricket? asked the Sena chief.         
	These industrialists are throwing money in your cricket field as a result of which cricket is getting corrupt. Cricketers are being purchased and, as a result of this, their concentration will not be in the game and the sport will decline in this country, he warned.         
	Stop this gambling by industrialists and save cricket. You (Pawar) have the guts to do it, dont you?, Thackeray said in the letter.           (PTI)

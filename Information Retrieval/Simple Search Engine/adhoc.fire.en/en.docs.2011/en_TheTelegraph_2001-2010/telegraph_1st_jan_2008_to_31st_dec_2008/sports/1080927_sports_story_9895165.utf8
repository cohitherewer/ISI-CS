The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB coach delighted with show
                                                                                                                                                                                                     EB coach delighted with show
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Soft-spoken East Bengal coach Stanley Rozario was delighted with his teams show against United SC at Barasat on Friday.         
	Full of praise for his side, Stanley said: I am understandably very happy with the result. It was a complete team performance where everyone gave their best.         
	Stanley, national coach Bob Houghtons first in command said his first match in charge of the red-and-gold brigade was a great experience. Stanleys last club coaching assignment was with the Army side.         
	When asked about East Bengals not so bright second half display after the promising first period, Stanley said: It was difficult to keep the same tempo in the second half, because United SC were three goals down and were therefore on the offensive We were also perhaps a little guilty of falling back and playing a little from the behind.         
	The East Bengal coach also lauded striker Yakubu for his stellar show. Stanley exuded professionalism as he affirmed that hed be keeping a close eye on Saturdays tie between bitter rivals Mohun Bagan and visitors Mumbai FC.         
	East Bengals next opponent is, of course, Mumbai FC. Man of the match Sunil Chhetri, who got his I-League tally off and running, said: It doesnt matter who gets the goals or picks up the money for the man of the match Our teamwork and communication was good, we were mostly well organised.         
	Sunil was confident of an improved showing in the matches to come. Its going to take us some time to find the right shape and combination, things will get better.         
	The difference in the East Bengal side which played most of the local league and the men who took the field against United SC on Friday, was the emergence of renewed hunger and energy.         
	Sunil too affirmed that. In the Calcutta league, most of us from the national squad werent there, plus there were fitness problems, but itll be different here in the I-League, he said.         
	United SC coach Subrata Bhattacharjee though didnt seem to read too much into his sides loss.         
	He put it down to lack of foreigners and inexperience in his squad. My team had a lot of new boys and their inexperience showed, as they got a little overawed playing the first match against a big team like East Bengal.         
	Bhattacharjee also attributed the first goal conceded by United SC to silly mistakes.         
	The early goal did us in, he added referring to Surkumar Singhs 10th minute strike. Bhattacharjee confirmed that before his sides next game away to Mahindra United, he would enrol the services of at least a single foreigner. I will make up my mind on the foreigner issue in the next 48 hours.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     JCT pump in 2 past Sporting
  - FEDERATION CUP       A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: Balwant Singh and Eduardo Da Silva scored a goal apiece as JCT beat Sporting Clube de Goa 2-0 in their group C encounter of the ongoing 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Thursday.         
	Dominating from the word go, JCT drew first blood in the 27th minute.         
	It was a Jaspal Singh corner from the right. Not dealt with by the Sporting defenders inside the box, it was collected by an unmarked Julius Irabor Akpele, whose outgoing side-volley was nodded inside by Balwant Singh in the left corner.         
	The Goans, donning the jersey of their Lisbon counterpart  Sporting Clube de Portugal  were far from their usual selves.         
	They were not only defensive but also lacked any fighting spirit.

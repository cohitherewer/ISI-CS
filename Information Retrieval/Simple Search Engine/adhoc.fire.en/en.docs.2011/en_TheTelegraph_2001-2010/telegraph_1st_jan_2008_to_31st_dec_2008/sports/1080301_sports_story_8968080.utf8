                                                   Youve got to treat the team as an extension of your family: Praveen
  - Policemans son from Meerut is looking to improve and be consistent       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                          
	Sydney: Praveen Kumar is unlikely to ever become a pin-up hero, but the 21-year-old son of a head constable in Meerut has what it takes to be an effective new-ball or first-change bowler.         
	Man-of-the-Match in Team Indias last league engagement in the ongoing tri-series, versus Sri Lanka in Hobart, Praveen spoke to The Telegraph at the Radisson Plaza here on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Hailing from a family of wrestlers         
	(Laughs) My fathers elder brother, Jagat Singh, has been a Hind Kesri You could say Im from a family of sportsmen as my fathers younger brother, Azad Singh, has represented India in kabaddi.         
	Whether hed also been encouraged to either wrestle or take to kabaddi         
	Early on, seeing my build, there was talk that I become a wrestler, but my parents (Sakat and Murti) didnt discourage me whenever I played cricket Maine gali aur mohalla se start kiya I began improving once I joined the Victoria Park team in Meerut Its thanks to (former India offie) Gopal Sharma that I began playing for UP.         
	His idol         
	When I was young, its Kapil Dev who fascinated me Be it bowling or batting, I liked everything about his game I also admired the way Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis bowled.         
	Whether he has had an interaction with Akram, who is in Australia on a TV assignment         
	No Abhi tak mauka nahin mila The tour isnt over, so lets see.         
	His India debut, during last Novembers ODI against Pakistan in Jaipur, where he had to go wicketless         
	I wasnt that nervous, nor did I keep telling myself that Id taken a big step forward from domestic cricket People say theres a lot of pressure while playing for the country, but they forget that theres pressure at the domestic level too.         
	On whether, having opened for Central Zone (in the Deodhar) and for UP, he sees himself as an allrounder         
	(Laughs again) Im a bowler first Other things come later.         
	The areas he needs to improve         
	Bowl a better line and length and, of course, try and bowl quicker. And, when Im batting, Id like to concentrate harder.         
	Whether hes learnt a few things on this tour, his first for Team India         
	More concerning me as a person Ive never been away from home for so long and, so, Ive had to adjust Ive learnt that bonding is important That youve got to treat the team as an extension of your family. Im sure other things remain to be learnt.         
	The MoM award on Tuesday         
	My hard work got rewarded But thats over and done with Today, I know Ive got to be consistent and must improve on that performance (four for 31).         
	Aiming for Test cricket         
	Absolutely Woh aas hamesha se hai         
	Interest in other sport         
	I play a bit of volleyball Im not fond of soccer or tennis as quite a few of my teammates are.         
	Hobbies         
	Listening to music Sunidhi Chauhan and Sukhwinder Singh are my favourites I like watching Amitabh (Bachchan) movies too I dont know whether you can call it a hobby, but I quite like watching cricket telecasts.         
	On having signed for Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL)         
	Im looking forward to the IPL In fact, it has changed everything Now, I can look at either extending our existing house (on Baghpat Road) or building a new one Then, I wont have to think twice about buying a Ford Endeavour Given the condition of the roads, especially from Meerut to our village (Shamli, some 90 kms away), Im not thinking of any other vehicle Hopefully, Ill also be able to help set up a business for my elder brother, Vinay Dekhiye, IPL ne sab kuch change kar diya hai.         
	Whether, with the tour about to end, something still remains on his shopping list         
	(Laughs yet again) Well, I intend buying a couple of pairs of pure leather shoes for my father Ive been wanting to pick up something for my mother too, but havent figured out what to get.         
	Finally, the most memorable experience in his short career as an India cricketer         
	Having the opportunity to bowl to Sachin Tendulkar, (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh at nets Also, sharing the same dressing room. Badi baat rahi hai.

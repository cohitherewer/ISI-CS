            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Students of Goethe-Institut, who had come as cheerleaders to the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday, were targeted with missiles by the crowd towards the end of the match.         
	There were about 50 students chanting Danke (thank you) Oli near the turf.         
	Things began to deteriorate after we applauded the first goal, said Tomoghno Chakraborty.         
	Once the flare-up happened on the field in the second half and two players were sent off, the tension spread to the galleries. They threw water bottles and hurled abuses at us , said a shocked Moumita Nandi.         
	Reimar Volker, director of Goethe-Institut, chose to play down the incident.         
	The crowd did get hostile towards the end and we had to gather our students together. But I dont think they had any bad intentions. They were just disappointed with their teams loss.

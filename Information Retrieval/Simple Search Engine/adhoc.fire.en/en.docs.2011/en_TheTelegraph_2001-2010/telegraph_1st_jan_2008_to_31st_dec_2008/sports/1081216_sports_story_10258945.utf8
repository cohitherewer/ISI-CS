	Indias total of 387 for four is now the highest total posted in the fourth innings of a Test match in the subcontinent. The previous highest score being 364 for six by India against Pakistan in Delhi in 1979-80. The Test, however, was drawn.         
	Indias total of 387 for four is now the highest total in the fourth innings at this ground. India had scored 347 against Australia in the tied Test in September 1986.         
	Prior to this successful chase, the highest score chased in the fourth innings to win a match in India was 276, by the West Indies in Delhi in 1987.         
	India posted 300 plus runs in the fourth innings of a Test for the fifth time on Indian soil.         
	When on 56, Sachin Tendulkar brought up 1000 runs in the calendar year 2008.         
	It is for the fifth time in his career that he has recorded 1000 plus runs in a calendar year. He joined Brian Lara and Mathew Hayden, who have also recorded 1000 runs in a calendar year on five occasions.         
	Tendulkar scored his 42nd Test hundred, his seventh against England, the most by an Indian. Mohammed Azharuddin scored six hundreds against England.         
	This was Tendulkars fifth hundred at Chepauk. The other Indians to score five hundreds at a single Indian venue are Sunil Gavaskar at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai and Mohammed Azharuddin at Eden Gardens.         
	Tendulkar recorded his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match. He has now scored one for a winning cause (103 vs Eng, Chepauk, 2008), one in a lost (136 vs Pak, Chepauk, 1998-99) and one in a drawn cause (119* vs Eng at Manchester 1990).         
	His highest score in the fourth innings of a Test also came at Chepauk when he scored 136 against Pakistan in 1998-99.         
	When on 12, Tendulkar and V.V.S Laxman, in 16 innings, brought up 1000 runs together for the fourth wicket. They become the 21st pair overall and the fourth Indian pair to do so. The pair now has 1029 runs for the fourth wicket. Sourav Ganguly and Tendulkar have scored most runs for the fourth wicket  2695 runs in 44 innings at 64.17.         
	Tendulkar has now been involved in 70 century partnerships. Only Rahul Dravid, with 72, has been involved in more.         
	Virender Sehwag won his seventh Man of the match award in Tests, his first against England.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni won his fourth Test match in a row as captain.         
	Only two England captains have lost the match after declaring in the third innings. Norman Yardley lost to Australia at Leeds in 1948 and David Gower lost to the West Indies at Lords in 1984.         
	This is the first time Virender Sehwag has won a Man of the Match prize despite not scoring a century.         
	With one Test to go for the year, Rahul Dravid has scored 669 runs this year at an average of 27.87, the lowest he has averaged in a year in his career. Since he gave up captaincy in August 2007, Dravid has scored 881 runs at 28.41.         
	Andrew Strauss becomes the eighth cricketer to score a century in each innings and end up on the losing side. He is the second England player after Herbert Sutcliffe (176 amp; 127) against Australia in Melbourne in 1924-25 to do so.         
	COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

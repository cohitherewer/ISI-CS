The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England players in boycott threat
                                                                                                                                                                                                       England players in boycott threat
  - We have been left in the lurch by ECB in two previous tours, says Andrew Strauss       NICK HOULT            Andrew Strauss amp; Co. are against touring Zimbabwe                                 
	The England team will consider boycotting next summers Test and one-day series against Zimbabwe if Robert Mugabes regime is still in power.         
	Zimbabwe are due to play two Tests and three one-day matches in England next year as precursor to the Ashes series, but opening batsman Andrew Strauss admitted on Tuesday the players will have to examine their own consciences and could refuse to play.         
	Strauss, speaking during a question and answer session following Archbishop Desmond Tutus Colin Cowdrey Lecture at Lords, also criticised the previous handling of the Zimbabwe issue by the England amp; Wales Cricket Board.         
	He said: Two previous tours have been very difficult and the players have been left in the lurch by the ECB and the government. It has come down to personal preference and some tough decisions have been made.         
	When asked about a players boycott, he said: It is something we are going to have to talk about. We have felt in the past that there have been great opportunities for the government to show the strength of feeling that there is among the whole population. There was a general feeling that the last tour should not have gone ahead.         
	Strausss stance was warmly received by Archbishop Tutu, who also called on the authorities to make a stand.         
	It is fantastic and I hope they do, but it should not be left to players to make that decision, he said. It really should be administrators, and even more so governments, even at a time when they are chary of appearing to intervene in a sporting matter like this.         
	When you have egregious violations of human rights and governments saying this is something we will not tolerate It is difficult for the ICC but it is because it is difficult that the nettle has to be grasped.         
	I think they are more aware of how people are incensed by what is happening and they will be totally out of step if they do nothing.         
	Tutu also called on the British public to make a stand if the Zimbabwe tour goes ahead with a boycott of one days play.         
	The result of the second round of Zimbabwes presidential vote is due in two weeks time and the ECB are hoping the issue is resolved by a victory for Morgan Tsvangirai.         
	If not, the Zimbabwe issue will again hound the ECB, although the government is likely to take direct action.         
	Zimbabwes Test status is currently suspended and that is unlikely to change next year. But the one-day series is due to go ahead and Zimbabwe will also be a part of the ICC Twenty20 Championship in England.

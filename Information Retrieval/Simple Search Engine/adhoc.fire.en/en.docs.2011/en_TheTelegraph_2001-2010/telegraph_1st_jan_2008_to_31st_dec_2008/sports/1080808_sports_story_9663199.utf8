  - Grass trimmed at P. Sara wicket       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Former captain and now Sri Lanka Cricket chairman Arjuna Ranatunga with Sourav Ganguly in Colombo on Thursday. (AFP)                                 
	Colombo: Legend has it that Sir Donald Bradman labelled the P. Sara Stadium wicket as one of the finest around. That was six decades ago.         
	Friday, of course, will see the venue host the deciding Test for the Idea Cup and the focus, not surprisingly, is on the wicket which arguably is Sri Lankas quickest and has the most bounce.         
	There was much less grass on Thursday morning and Sri Lanka Crickets national curator Anuruddha Polonowita, a former player, said more would be cut before he and his men finished preparations.         
	Theres going to be much moisture, because of the sweating, and if theres a sizeable amount of grass then three-four wickets could fall very quickly (on the first morning)... We want a good, fair contest, he maintained.         
	In that case, why was there so much of green on Wednesday? Clearly, after the thrashing in Galle, the hosts havent been in the best frame of mind.         
	The P. Sara Stadium, by the way, is also the home ground of the Tamil Union Club and, once Muttiah Muralidharan moved out of Kandy, the venue where he played most of his early cricket in Colombo.         
	Murali, in fact, captained the club in 1998-99.         
	Theres plenty of history in the air and the Indians are determined to script some themselves. Only once before, at home in 2000-01 (versus Australia) have we lost the first Test in a three-match series and rallied to win the next two.         
	That was under Sourav Ganguly, with the face-off having the status of an absolute classic.         
	The present captain, Anil Kumble, played no part in that series. However, this time, he wants to return home with the trophy.         
	In terms of confidence, in terms of strategy, we have done whatever we could to ensure we win the Test and the series, Kumble told the media.         
	The team, incidentally, is without coach Gary Kirsten.         
	Later, Kumbles response to a question was: Ive always believed cricket is a partnership game... Applying pressure at both ends, as a bowling unit and as a batting unit... Without Gautam Gambhirs contribution, Virender Sehwag couldnt have got the double hundred (in Galle last week)... Everyone contributes, its a team sport...         
	So it is and the Big Three  Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav and Rahul Dravid  need to buck up. Together, so far, theyve contributed no more than 188 runs.         
	Kumble didnt mention that number, but made the point that his team had just won a Test pretty comfortably without significant contributions from any of them.         
	With the Sri Lankans not exactly used to losing at home, captain Mahela Jayawardene is under considerable pressure. He put up a brave front, though: That (thought of being defeated) doesnt go through our heads...         
	A question on mystery man Ajantha Mendis had to come up and it did. Mahela answered crisply. Ajantha has picked up 18 wickets in two Tests. Do you think they are picking him? Im glad that they are picking him and hes still picking up wickets!         
	As was indicated in these columns, Nuwan Kulasekara has been dropped and his place will either be taken by Dhammika Prasad or Thushara Mirando.         
	Both are much quicker.         
	Talking of Team India, Parthiv Patel is making a comeback after almost four years  that he was favoured to was reported by The Telegraph in the lead-up to the decider.         
	Out of the XI is Dinesh Karthik, who wasnt quite there  be it behind the wickets or in front  in the first two Tests.         
	While Karthik was short on confidence, Parthiv seems to have plenty of the C Factor.         
	Meanwhile, even if Kumble and Co. win at the P. Sara Stadium, they wont regain the No. 2 position in the ICC standings. That, however, wont matter if a series is won in Sri Lanka after 15 years.

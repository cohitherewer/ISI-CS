The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ready to bat wherever needed, says Yusuf
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ready to bat wherever needed, says Yusuf
                      
	Indore: Allrounder Yusuf Pathan said he was prepared to bat at any position so long as it helps the team pile on a match-winning total.         
	The stocky right-hand batsman scored a crucial unbeaten half-century batting down the order against England on Monday.         
	I am willing to bat wherever I get the opportunity to serve the team best, said the 26-year-old, who also clarified that he had celebrated his birthday last month and not on Monday as wrongly noted by some statisticians.         
	This performance will give me a lot of confidence and I dedicate my first ODI half century to my parents, he told reporters after his teams 54-run win.         
	Yusuf came in at No. 7 and smashed an unbeaten 50 to propel the team total to a commanding 292/9 and also picked a wicket in the second ODI against England.         
	The allrounder said Mondays victory was a team effort and it was important for him not to lose his wicket.         
	We knew it was not an easy wicket to bat on I wanted to score as many runs as possible to give our team a good total, he said.         
	England captain Kevin Pietersen put on a brave face after the second straight loss to India, saying that his teams performance had considerably improved from the huge loss they suffered in Rajkot.         
	We certainly played good cricket on Monday and were in the game before losing it. We were totally outplayed in the first game. I see it as an improvement, Pietersen said.         
	India, however, made it clear that there would be no let-up in intensity in the remaining matches of the series against England.         
	Right from the start of the series, we have put pressure on England and in the next matches also, we would be doing the same, vice-captain Virender Sehwag said.         
	Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sehwag admitted they had not expected the 290-plus score after a weak start on a two-paced track. (Agencies)

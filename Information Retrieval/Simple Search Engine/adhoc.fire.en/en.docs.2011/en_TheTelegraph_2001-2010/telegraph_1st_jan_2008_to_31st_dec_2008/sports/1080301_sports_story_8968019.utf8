The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Return to city on Chhetris mind 
                                                   Return to city on Chhetris mind 
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: JCT forward Sunil Chhetri still misses his Calcutta days, when he played for Mohun Bagan between 2002 and 2005. Now, the AIFF Player of the Year has not ruled out returning to the city.         
	The India striker is now relaxing with the family at the moment and is yet to decide on his future with the Phagwara club.         
	I would love to play in Calcutta again By May or June things will be clearer. At the moment, Im just enjoying time with my family in Delhi, Chhetri told The Telegraph from Delhi.         
	Both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan are learnt to have shown interest in the spunky player as the Big Two prepare to go on transfer shopping.         
	Every footballer has a dream to play in Calcutta and Im fortunate to have started my career in the city. The city had a very big role in shaping my career. I was in class XII at that time and it was a great motivation having shared the dressing room with the likes of Bhaichung Bhutia and Rennedy Singh, he said.         
	On the timing of hosting the IFA Shield at the end of the season, he said: I think the organisers should make a proper calendar so that it gives the players some time to relax. Weve just finished the I-League and the national camp will start from April so its difficult for the players to give their best in this tournament.         
	Honoured as Indias best at 23 but the JCT player thinks his best is yet to come.

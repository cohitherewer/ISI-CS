The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia reach 341/8
                                                                                                                                                                                           Australia reach 341/8
                      
	Basseterre: David Hussey and Luke Ronchi hit two of the fastest ever Australian one-day half-centuries on Sunday to lead their side to 341 for eight in the fifth one-day International at Warner Park.         
	Ronchis 22-ball 50 initially equalled the second fastest achieved by an Australian batsman in limited overs competition but he slid to third after Hussey required just 19 balls to reach his own half-century.         
	Only Simon Donnell has posted a faster one-day 50 among Australian batsmen, requiring 18 deliveries to reach the mark against Sri Lanka in 1990. Husseys thunderous innings was also the equal fourth-fastest 50 among all one-day batsmen.         
	Ronchi was particularly brutal in his treatment of the West Indian trio of Fidel Edwards (3-86), Chris Gayle (0-33) and Dwayne Bravo (1-74), at one stage blasting five sixes in the space of nine deliveries off the bowling of Gayle and Edwards.         
	Rookie spinner Nikita Miller removed Ronchi for 64, caught behind with his first delivery, before fellow spinner Ramnaresh Sarwan left the tourists on 152 for four after dismissing captain Michael Clarke for five in the next over.         
	A 113-run fifth wicket-stand between Andrew Symonds (66) and Michael Hussey (51) steadied the Australian innings for younger brother David to add his quick-fire 52 in just his second one-day appearance before being removed by Sarwan.

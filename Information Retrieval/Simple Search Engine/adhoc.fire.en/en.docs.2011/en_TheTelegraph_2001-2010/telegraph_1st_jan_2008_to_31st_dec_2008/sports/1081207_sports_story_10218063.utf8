The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England focus on return to India
                                                                                                                                                                                                       England focus on return to India

	With one or two reservations, and unless something really sinister turns up in Sundays final security report, Englands cricketers seem to have made a collective mental decision to go back to India to play in the two Tests.         
	Still jittery after the Mumbai atrocities, it would not take much to change that attitude. But for now, it looks as though the first Test will go ahead in Chennai, with the second possibly switching from Mohali to Bangalore, as the England and Wales Cricket Board seek a quick exit for the team once the series is over.         
	Im hoping we all get on the bus on Monday, Paul Collingwood said after a light practice session at Abu Dhabis swish Sheikh Zaid stadium. Hopefully, well send a team, well be safe and we play cricket out there, because thats what India, as a cricket-loving nation, needs.         
	At the moment, Im focused on the cricket and trying to put all those distractions to the back of my mind. It isnt ideal preparation for playing a side as strong as India, but Im definitely looking forward to the Test starting on Thursday.         
	One of those with a young family, Collingwood admitted that his own thoughts and feelings about whether to return had changed several times since the killing spree began eight days ago.         
	Your mood fluctuates all the time, he said. What happened over in Mumbai was unbelievable. But cricket is what we do and in the end you have to put your trust about whether a place is safe in the hands of the security officer, the ECB and the BCCI. Its cricket that were good at, not judging whether a place is safe or not.         
	To that end, Hugh and Sean Morris, managing director of the England team and the teams union boss, respectively, flew to Chennai on Friday afternoon. After giving the stadium and the team hotel the once-over on Saturday, they will inspect the other venue. If that stays as Mohali they will struggle to get back here by Sunday evening, the deadline by when players need to make their final decision.         
	For that reason, as well as the request for an easy rather than convoluted route home (Mohali has a military airfield that allows just a few commercial flights a day), the final Test could yet be in Bangalore.         
	Friday, in sleepy Abu Dhabi (it was the start of the festival of Eid, so the streets were quiet), there were no commandos or outriders to protect the team.         
	At the ground, four men in well-starched uniforms just seemed to be on hand to shoo away some curious expats, not that England needed their muscle after opting for safety in numbers  there were 39 players and staff at practice. Perhaps surprisingly, given the trauma many of the players claim to have suffered, there was no psychologist, which suggests that minds have already been made up.         
	If and when England do return to India, Collingwood confirmed that a huge security blanket will be thrown around them. Nobody wants anything to happen, he said. We had presidential-level security in India in 2002 after 9/11. We tend to eat in hotels anyway. I felt safe in 2002, but whenever Ive travelled with England, Ive always felt safe.         
	Light on preparation, England would not be expected to win the series. Yet teams can sometimes surprise themselves and everybody else when the pressure is off. These situations can really pull teams a lot closer, Collingwood said.         
	 Hopefully, this is one of those times. It isnt ideal but it can drive a good team culture and get everyone together. So if everyone is on that plane, hopefully youll see a very buoyant England team and one hitting India hard on Thursday.

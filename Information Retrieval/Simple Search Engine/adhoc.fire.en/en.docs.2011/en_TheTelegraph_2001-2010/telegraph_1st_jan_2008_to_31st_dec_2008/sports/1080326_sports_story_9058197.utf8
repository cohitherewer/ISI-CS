                                                   Battle of attrition   in stifling heat
  - Pitch at the centre of immense speculation       INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                                              
	Chennai: The Corporation Stadium is a couple of kilometres away from the Chepauk. Now christened the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, its mostly used for football. It is ironical that having rewritten the opening partnership in Chittagong at the start of this month, Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie are playing their next Test in the same city that saw the creation of the world record 52 years ago.         
	Pankaj Roy and Vinoo Mankad put on 413 runs against New Zealand in 1956 until the South African opening pair erased the Indians names from the record books. No wonder heightened expectations will add to their pressure.         
	If you thought the 415-run mark along with Indias sensational Test performance Down Under would have provided the perfect build-up for the Future Cup, you would surely be disappointed. The occasion is seen more as an opportunity to promote the Chennai Super Kings for the upcoming Indian Premier League.         
	The Indian and South African teams practised in the morning and afternoon, respectively, with no mad rush of autograph hunters or spectators. The energy sapping heat and humidity is one reason for the lukewarm response. Yet the series promises to be exciting.         
	Gary Kirsten will be up against his home country in his first assignment as Indias coach. More importantly, the South Africans are dreading the presence of Paddy Upton among the Team India support staff. Then there will be the Dale Steyn factor.         
	The pitch has been the centre of immense speculation. Anil Kumble spoke of good bounce and carry at the initial stages with the spinners coming into the frame later on.         
	His counterpart also echoed similar sentiments. The wicket is going to spin at some stage, said Smith.         
	The Indians are likely to go in with a four pronged attack  two pacers and two spinners. While Kumble and Harbhajan Singh are the automatic choices, the new ball will be shared by Rudra Pratap Singh and Sreesanth. This means there will be no place for Irfan Pathan. No doubt the spinners will have to share the bulk of the workload, especially in subcontinent conditions.         
	The thinktank has decided to go in with specialist openers. Wasim Jaffers place at the top of the order was under the spotlight after six consecutive failures in three Tests in Australia - he aggregated 49  but he has managed to hang on for now.         
	Like in all their previous tours, the visitors have done their homework well. Steyn arrives with a reputation of having run through sides and a lot will depend on how effective he can prove to be in these conditions. South Africa will have plenty to handle. Not just the home batsmen and bowlers. They will also have to cope with the stifling conditions. Smith spoke of experience and ability in their ranks and they will need loads of them to maintain their good run in the sub continent.

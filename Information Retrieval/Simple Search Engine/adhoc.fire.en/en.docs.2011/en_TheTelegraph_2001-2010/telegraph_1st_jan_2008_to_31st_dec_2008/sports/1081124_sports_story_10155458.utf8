The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pacers set it up: Viru
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pacers set it up: Viru
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, having sealed the series on Sunday, said that the hosts would give a chance to the reserve players in the rest of the matches.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Dhoni: The rain and the moisture made it difficult for the bowlers to grip the ball. England kept on going and it was harder because we had one regular spinner and two part-timers in our squad. Zaheer bowled well along with Ishant but overall the series victory was a team effort. Zak has been very consistent in the series. Well make a few changes in the side now. Guys who have not played will get a chance.         
	Kevin Pietersen: At the end of the day weve been done by an Indian side who are playing great cricket. Owais Shah was fantastic, Freddie also played well. But we were done in by Virender Sehwag.         
	Virender Sehwag (MoM): It was a good track to bat on. I was ready from the first ball If I see the ball is there to be hit, I hit it. Thanks to our coach, who has been spending a lot of time on my batting... All the pacers bowled well and set up the victory for us... I think Gauti (Gautam Gambhir) is more aggressive than me.

	Chandigarh: Former champions Bangalore Hi-Fliers rallied brilliantly through a Len Aiyappa brace in the regulation time to stun defending champions Orissa Steelers 5-4 via penalty shoot-out in the PHL final on Saturday. Chandigarh Dynamos, who pipped Sultans 5-3 in the shoot-out, were the other finalists.         
	Locked 2-2 in the regulation time, Hi-Fliers and Steelers failed to score in the extra-time for silver goal and went into the tie-breaker. Prabodh Tirkey and Roshan Minz were successful for Steelers, while Damandeep, Kim Chul and William Xalxo failed to score. For Hi-Fliers, Tushar Khandekar and Sebastian missed the first two strokes while Arjun Halappa, Vikramkanth and Sandeep Michael settled the issue.         
	Earlier, Steelers took an early lead in the 11th minute through Sunil Ekka. Five minutes later, Ekka completed his brace. Hi-Fliers equalised through Aiyappa in the 23rd and 60th mintues.

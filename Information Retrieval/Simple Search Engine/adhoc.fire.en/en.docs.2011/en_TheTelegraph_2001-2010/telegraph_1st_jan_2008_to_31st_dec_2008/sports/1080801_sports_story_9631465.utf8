            Olympic Digest                
	 Baghdad: Four Iraqi athletes will go to the Games, organisers said on Thursday, up from an initial two allowed to take part when the IOC lifted a ban on Iraqs participation.         
	Iraqs Youth and Sports Minister Jasem Mohammed Jaafar said that six of Iraqs seven-member team have been confirmed to take part, and talks were under way to secure a place for the seventh. The reason for the discrepancy in the numbers was not immediately clear.   
	Sharapova doubtful  
	 Montreal: Maria Sharapova withdrew from the Rogers Open after her second-round victory over Marta Domachowska on Wednesday because of a shoulder injury, jeopardizing her participation in the Beijing Olympics.         
	Third-seeded Sharapova of Russia defeated Domachowska of Poland 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 in a match that took nearly three hours.   
	Six Russians banned  
	 Moscow: The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has banned six leading Russian women after being suspected of manipulating drug samples, a senior official said on Thursday.         
	All six are definitely suspended and will miss the Olympics, Russian Athletics Federation (RAF) president Valentin Balakhnichyov said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson exudes confidence
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ferguson exudes confidence
                  Ferguson                     
	Barcelona: Manchester United are better-equipped to face Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals than they were at this stage last year against AC Milan, manager Alex Ferguson said on Tuesday.         
	Most times weve not been successful in semi-finals but I think we are in a much stronger position this year in terms of the energy of the team, Ferguson told reporters as he prepared for Wednesdays first leg at the Nou Camp.         
	Last year we played the same team all the time and this time we havent. I hope that makes a difference. But the important thing about any semi-final is to enjoy it.         
	United surrendered a 3-2 first leg lead against Milan when they lost 0-3 at the San Siro last year. They have only reached the final in two of their previous nine semi-final appearances in Europes top club competition.         
	Wednesday will be Uniteds first visit to the Nou Camp since their heart-stopping 2-1 victory over Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in 1999.         
	Ferguson said the current United side were better equipped to play in Europe than their 1994 predecessors and were capable of emulating the success of the 1999 side.         
	Ferguson confirmed that striker Wayne Rooney had recovered from a minor injury niggle and would play against Barcelona.         
	Hes fit, he said. It was a knock on the hip which will not stop him from playing.           (REUTERS)

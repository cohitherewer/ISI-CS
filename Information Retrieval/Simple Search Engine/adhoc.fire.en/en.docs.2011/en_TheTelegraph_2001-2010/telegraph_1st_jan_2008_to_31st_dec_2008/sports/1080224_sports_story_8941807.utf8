The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla take lead against SA
                                                   Bangla take lead against SA
                      
	Dhaka: Opening batsman Junaid Siddiqui and fast bowler Shahadat Hossain combined to help Bangladesh take a 147-run lead on Day II of the first test against South Africa on Saturday.         
	Junaid was unbeaten on 64 at the close as the home team reached 125 for four in their second innings after skittling South Africa for 170 thanks to a career-best haul of six for 27 by Shahadat.         
	Bangladesh were struggling at tea on 48 for three but added 77 runs in the final session for the loss of Mohammed Ashraful, who was caught behind for 24 by Mark Boucher off the bowling of paceman Makhaya Ntini.         
	Junaid hit five fours in his 158-ball knock and among the crowd in the post-tea session was the head of Bangladeshs interim government Fakhruddin Ahmed.         
	Paceman Dale Steyn had made a dynamic start for South Africa, taking three quick wickets as the hosts slumped to 29 for three.         
	Steyn also picked up three wickets in Bangladeshs first innings 192.         
	South Africas batsmen resumed on 76 for four on Saturday morning and had Ashwell Prince run out for 10 in the second over thanks to Saqibul Hasans smart throw .         
	AB de Villiers constructed a 68-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Johan Botha before De Villiers was caught and bowled by Ashraful for 46. Botha was then trapped lbw for 25 by Shahadat, who also removed Morne Morkel for one.         
	Shahadat followed up by dismissing Mark Boucher for 11 and Steyn for seven.                   (REUTERS)

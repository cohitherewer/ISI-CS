	Sania to lead  
	Hong Kong: Sania Mirza will spearhead the Asia-Pacific challenge in the World Team Challenge tournament in Hong Kong next year.  
	The January 7-10 tournament, a new concept and warm-up competition for the Australian Open, will feature four teams representing Europe, Russia, the Americas and Asia-Pacific.         
	Each team will be represented by three players who would compete in both singles and doubles, Hong Kong Tennis Patrons Association president Ian Wade said on Thursday.   
	Federer to play  
	 Madrid: World No. 2 Roger Federer has confirmed he will take part in the Madrid Masters event next week, after a three week layoff.         
	It is great to know we can count on Federers participation for another year, competition organiser Manolo Santana was quoted as saying in the Spanish media on Friday.         
	I hope he arrives well rested so that we can enjoy his best tennis. The conditions in Madrid and the type of surface are ideal for his style of play.   
	UCI clearance  
	 Geneva: Cyclings governing body is relaxing its own rules to allow Lance Armstrong to make his road race comeback in Australia in January.         
	The International Cycling Union (UCI) said the seven-time Tour de France champion can compete in the January 20-25 Tour Down Under, his first race since coming out of retirement after three years.         
	A strict application of dope testing rules would not have allowed the 37-year-old American to compete until February 1, 2009, six months after he filed paperwork with the US Anti-Doping Agency.         
	But the UCI said on Thursday that Armstrong could return early because its drug-testing standards have improved since the rule was drawn up four years ago.   
	Asif hopeful  
	 Karachi: Pakistan pacer Mohammed Asif will be keeping his fingers crossed in his bid to escape a two-year ban for doping offence when he faces the drugs inquiry tribunal of the Indian Premier League (IPL) on October 11.         
	Asif left for Mumbai on Thursday with lawyer Shahid Karim to attend the hearing which has to decide if there is enough evidence to turn Asifs present suspension into a two year ban or whether he be cleared on technical grounds.   
	Shastri to officiate  
	 Durban: Indian umpire, Suresh Shastri, reached here on an exchange programme to officiate in Cricket South Africas (CSAs) first class matches. The ICC international panel umpire is the first in an exchange programme between CSA and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	Mr Moabi Litekho, CSAs media spokesperson, said the programme was initiated by CSA General Manager of Cricket Operations, Brian Basson, with the outgoing BCCI secretary, Niranjan Shah, in Malaysia this year.

      Use a bat thats comfortable for you      Never take eyes off the ball while taking a catch                                                                
	Whenever I try to flick a short delivery around my leg stump, I often get caught behind. Why does this happen?              
	(Hemant Prasad, 13, Dhanbad)              
	Try and play with the bat close to the body so that you are in more control over the shot.              
	I am a leg-spinner. How does one bowl the flipper?              
	(Kaustav Chakraborty, 15, Calcutta-21)              
	It demands a lot of practice where a subtle change in grip squeezes the ball through the fingers and makes the ball skid through after pitching.              
	I am a right-arm mediumpacer. How does one bowl the late swinging deliveries?              
	(Deborshi Mukherjee, 16, Calcutta-41)              
	You need to work with your coach so that you have a good grip and wrist action at the time of delivery.              
	Whenever I play against spinners, I fail to get to the line of the ball. Please help.              
	(Tuhin Das, 14, Calcutta-13)              
	Watch the ball and get close to the pitch of the ball when playing forward. It will help in getting closer to the line of the ball.               
	I am a right-handed batsman. When trying to hit over-pitched deliveries, I often get caught at mid-off region. Why does this happen?              
	(Tapas Chowdhury, 19, Calcutta19)              
	You are lifting your head early and not getting to the pitch of the ball.               
	I am a wicketkeeper and weak on the leg side. I always try and follow the ball coming out of the bowlers hand but the collection problem on the leg side persists. How can I improve?               
	(Sudipto Basu, Calcutta-16)              
	Work on your footwork when you move sideways and make sure you dont look to snatch the ball.              
	Please suggest some good exercises to improve footwork?              
	(Rohan Roy, Calcutta)              
	Lots of running and skipping.              
	I am an opener. Is shuffling a bit necessary to tackle fast bowlers?              
	(Shyam Das, 17, Calcutta)              
	If it helps you get in line and gives you the extra bit of time needed.               
	I face problems with taking high catches. I judge it wrongly and hence drop it. Please help.              
	(Piyush Tarafdar, 17, Calcutta-61)              
	Its very important that when you are running for a catch you never take your eyes off the ball.              
	Should kids start with a heavy or light bat?              
	(Namit Saha, 39, Jamshedpur)              
	Use a bat thats comfortable for you.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Calcuttas loss is New Delhis gain. Indias Asia-Oceania Zone Davis Cup tie versus Japan will be held in the capital.         
	Even though South Club had offered to host the April 8-10 tie, a less than keen Bengal Tennis Association (BTA) has ensured that the city wont get to witness Leander Paes amp; Co. in action.         
	According to BTA secretary Hiranmoy Chatterjee, building new stands for the event involves money and it would be difficult owing to lack of sponsor interest. AITA sources also confirmed the development.

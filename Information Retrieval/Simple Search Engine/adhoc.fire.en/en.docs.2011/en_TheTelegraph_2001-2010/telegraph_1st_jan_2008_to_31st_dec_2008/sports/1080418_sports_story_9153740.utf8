The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB must be lenient with the players
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ECB must be lenient with the players
                                      Guest Column     Geoffrey Boycott    
	Allen Stanfords proposal to put up $20 million for a winner-takes-all Twenty20 match is a magnanimous gesture. But if anyone thinks it is going to solve all the problems surrounding the best England players and the Indian Premier League (IPL), theyve got their head stuck in the sand.         
	What Stanford is talking about is a one-off match, between England and a West Indies all-star side.There is a big distinction between Stanfords grand gesture and the IPL, who have sold broadcasting rights to Sony for the next 10 years.         
	Players such as Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar have signed three-year deals worth a little over 500,000 each year: 1.5 million, guaranteed. And if you take to someone like Kevin Pietersen, who is just 28, he could probably swing a six-year contract. He would be looking at a fantastic regular income, even by the standards of a English Premier League footballer.         
	I am not surprised that the players and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) find themselves at odds over this issue.         
	Apart from the Indians, Australians and Englishmen, the rest of the worlds cricketers earn very ordinary money.         
	Most of the top England players are miffed that they havent had a slice of the cake  and that wont change no matter what happens in the West Indies. I dont believe they will insist on playing the whole IPL tournament but they would like at least two or three weeks.         
	Englands only commitment over that period is a two-Test series at home against one of the worlds worst teams.         
	Can you see the likes of Pietersen or Andrew Flintoff happily giving up half-a-million quid in order to beat the hell out of the Bangladeshis?         
	The ECB have been saying that there is no way the England players can appear in the IPL, either this year or the next. But I believe they will have to compromise. There is no point playing hardball just for the sake of it.         
	The ECB should scrap the two-Test series now. The players should be offered reduced contracts, to take account of the time they will have off in April.         
	Next, the players should be given leave to appear for three weeks in the IPL, as long as they return to England afterwards for a rest. Then they should play three County Championship games to get themselves fit and focused for the first Ashes Test, which starts on July 8.         
	Its a similar solution to the one Australia came up with this year.         
	They scrapped their tour of Pakistan on safety and security grounds and gave the players a fortnights window to appear in the IPL before reporting back for training camps ahead of their visit to the Caribbean. Im not talking about a long-term answer, just a quick fix while we weigh up what it all means and where its all going.         
	And if the players dont like the idea of missing half the IPL, the ECB have one big ace in the pack. They can come back and say: You dont have to have a central contracts at all. And we dont have to pick you.         
	Once these lads stop getting international exposure, all their endorsement deals are worthless, no matter how many Indians are watching them in the IPL.         
	Common sense and compromise: that is what this affair is calling for. Its time to gather everyone around a table  ECB, players, broadcasters and sponsors  and come up with a workable solution before the situation gets out of hand.

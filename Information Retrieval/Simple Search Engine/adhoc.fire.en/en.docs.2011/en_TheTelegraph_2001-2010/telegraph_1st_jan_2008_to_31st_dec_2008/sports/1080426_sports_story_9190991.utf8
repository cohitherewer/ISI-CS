The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Top 10 finish by Fisichella, Sutil 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Top 10 finish by Fisichella, Sutil 
  - RAIKKONEN FASTEST IN BOTH PRACTICE SESSIONS             Giancarlo Fisichella during the second practice session at the Catalunya racetrack on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Barcelona: Force India began the European leg of the Formula One season with a bang as both drivers notched up top 10 finishes in the second practice session ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix here on Friday.         
	Fisichella was 17th on the timesheet in the first practice session while Sutil was 16th. In the afternoon, both bettered their timings with Fisichella finishing ninth, just ahead of his younger German teammate.         
	Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen was fastest in both practice sessions. The Finn, championship leader after the opening three long-haul races, set a best time of one minute 20.649 seconds in the morning and then topped the afternoon timesheets in 1:21.935.         
	His Brazilian teammate Felipe Massa was second fastest on a sunny morning but only fifth in the later session.         
	Instead, former champions Renault hinted at a possible improvement in form with Brazilian rookie Nelson Piquet second ahead of Spanish teammate and double world champion Fernando Alonso.         
	Piquets time was only 0.084 off Raikkonens, although the Ferraris had been nearly half a second quicker than the best of the rest before lunch at a circuit familiar to all from extensive testing.         
	The leading trio in the morning had all lapped inside Massas 2007 pole time of 1:21.421, with McLarens Lewis Hamilton third fastest in 1:21.192. The Briton was 11th in the afternoon, when the usual frontrunners concentrated more on longer runs with heavier fuel loads.         
	Despite the typical changeable weather conditions in Barcelona that saw the wind picking up over the day, Fisichella and Sutils first runs in the second session were enough to put them first and second on the time sheets for the first 30 minutes.         
	The pair then moved to concentrate on longer runs and eventually finished the session with ninth and tenth fastest laps.         
	Today there was in general much less grip, more understeer and wheelspin, so this morning I was struggling a little bit. In the afternoon I was happier and we went in the right direction. Its too early to say definitively but it doesnt look too bad, Fisichella said.         
	Sutil too felt the team has started well, even though wind made things tough at the Ciruit de Catalunya.         
	We put on some new tyres and did some new tyre runs in the second session and the balance was very good. I was quite happy, but then later on the wind increased and although the longer runs were not bad, I was not happy with the balance, Sutil said.

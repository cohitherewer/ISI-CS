The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Speed not amused by Yuvraj verdict
                                                Speed not amused by Yuvraj verdict
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sydney: Match Referee Mike Procters not guilty verdict in the Yuvraj Singh case at the MCG hasnt amused the International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed.         
	Ive had a chat with Procter and I understand his position just as he understands mine... Im not in favour of redefining dissent... If a batsman waits at the crease after being given out then its dissent, not disappointment, Speed told The Telegraph.         
	Yuvraj got away as Procter accepted his disappointment and not dissent plea. The left-hander had stood his ground in the first innings, after being given out by Billy Bowden for a duck.         
	Speed will formally convey his views to colleagues in the sports governing body. The case cant be reopened though.

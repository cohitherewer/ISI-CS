The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eduardo may return soon
                                                     Eduardo may return soon

	London: Arsenal striker Eduardo da Silva should make a full recovery after fracturing his left fibula and dislocating his ankle against Birmingham City at the weekend, the Premier League leaders said on Monday.         
	The Brazilian-born Croatia international was injured by a tackle from City defender Martin Taylor after three minutes, with many players visibly shocked by the extent of the damage. Eduardo underwent surgery at Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham before being transferred to a London hospital on Sunday.         
	Despite horrific photographs in many newspapers showing the players foot dangling at a sickening angle, the extent of the injury appears not as bad as first feared.         
	After consultations between the clubs medical staff and the orthopaedic surgeon, a tentative time frame has been put on his recovery.         
	All being well Eduardo will have his leg in plaster and be using crutches for the next six to eight weeks. After that partial weight-bearing exercises will be scheduled into a slow rehabilitation process, said a statement on the clubs website.         
	It is hoped Eduardo will be running again in six months and making a full recovery after nine months.         
	Arsenal said Eduardo would be released from hospital in a few days.         
	The game at Birmingham ended 2-2.           (REUTERS)

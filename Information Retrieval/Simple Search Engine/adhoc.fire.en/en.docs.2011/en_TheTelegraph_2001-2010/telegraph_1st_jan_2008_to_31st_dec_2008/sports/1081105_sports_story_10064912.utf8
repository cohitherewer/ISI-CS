                  Lewis Hamilton with his father Anthony                     
	London: The father of new Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton says racial abuse and other insults directed at his son and family had led him to consider withdrawing the 23-year-old black driver from the sport.         
	Anthony Hamilton expressed dismay at what he described as a hate campaign from different parts of the world against his son, who finished fifth in Sundays season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix to become the youngest and first black driver to win the F1 season title.         
	My family has taken a lot of stick (abuse) this past week, not just this past week, but the past few months, Anthony Hamilton was quoted as saying in British newspapers Tuesday, speaking in Sao Paulo. I did think that maybe this isnt the place for my family because as a parent you make sure you do right for your family and kids.         
	Hamilton said he never spoke to his son about withdrawing. I kept it to myself, even though I was going home thinking, I didnt think the world was quite like this, he said.         
	 And then you think, Its just the way it is, and Id send Lewis a text saying, Whatever happens, people love you. The negative people are a small percentage, and even the negative ones have a heart.         
	In the week leading up to the Brazilian race, Hamilton was the target of racist abuse on a Spanish website, was insulted by two Brazilian comedians and was handed a black cat  a symbol of bad luck in Brazil  at a sponsors function. .(AP)

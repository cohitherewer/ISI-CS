The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tired Ronaldo unsure of future
                                                                                                                                                                                           Tired Ronaldo unsure of future
                      
	Milan: Brazilian striker Ronaldo may retire from soccer following his latest serious knee injury, the 32-year-old said on Wednesday.         
	Ronaldo ruptured a tendon in his left knee playing for AC Milan in February and made his return earlier this week when he appeared for just 22 minutes in a charity match in Morocco.         
	I only played 22 minutes because I had a muscle problem recently, the Brazilian striker said. Football is my life, but 22 minutes at that pace is not much more than an exhibition. Real professionalism is completely different.         
	His Milan contract ran out in the close season and offers from big clubs have failed to materialise for the Brazilian, who has turned down an approach from Serie A midtable side Siena.         
	I thank them but I really dont know what the future holds for me, Ronaldo told an Italian sports daily. I dont know if I will continue playing or retire. I still havent taken a decision. There is no rush. I want to complete my recuperation. I could decide tomorrow or in a month. I really dont know.         
	Englands Manchester City have been linked with a move for the 1997 and 2002 Ballon dOr winner, along with Brazils Flamengo.         
	However, the former Real Madrid player is still nowhere near ready for action after struggling and looking overweight in Morocco.         
	I am tired because my rehabilitation work has been hard and my legs are heavy, added Ronaldo, who suffered serious injuries to his right knee while playing for Inter Milan in 1999 and 2000 but recovered to help Brazil win the 2002 World Cup.

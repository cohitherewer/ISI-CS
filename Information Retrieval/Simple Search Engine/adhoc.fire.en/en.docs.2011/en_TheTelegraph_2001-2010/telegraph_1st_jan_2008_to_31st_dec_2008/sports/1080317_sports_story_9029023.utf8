	Jeju: Jeev Milkha Singh was pipped to the post as the Indian golfer lost on the third play-off hole to Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland at the Ballantines Championship at the Pinx Golf Club here on Sunday.         
	Both players  tied for the lead going into the final round  were engaged in a grim battle and carded 66 each to an aggregate of 24-under 264.         
	That warranted a play-off and the matter was decided on the third extra hole after the first two failed to provide a winner in the inaugural edition of the tournament.         
	This is the second close loss for Jeev in recent weeks after he lost in the Indonesia Open.         
	Indias top-ranked golfer Jyoti Randhawa carded a creditable 67 on the final day to total 11-under 277 for tied 11th spot. Gaurav Ghei had a 70 to be on even par and tied 57th.         
	A day of high drama ended when Jeev failed to sink his birdie putt on the play-off 18th hole, allowing McDowell to take the first prize of $511,000. The Chandigarh golfer engineered an escape from the bunker on the second extra hole but could not finish the job.         
	McDowell had earlier won the 2002 Scandinavian Masters and the 2004 Italian Open.         
	Irishman Paul McGinley finished a distant third at 17-under after a final round of 69.         
	Jeev, who has been battling a flu and an injury recently, started in splendid fashion, notching up three consecutive birdies from the second hole onwards. A bogey on the par-four seventh was a temporary setback as he closed the outward nine with two straight birdies to record a 32.         
	He started the back nine with another birdie and added two more on the 13th and 16th, but the bogey on 17th would come back to haunt him.         
	McDowell found his first birdie on the third hole but gave the shot back on the next hole. He made two more birdies on the outward nine to record a 34 and be two behind Jeev as they made the turn. He halved the lead with an eagle on the 10th and made birdie on 12th to draw level.         
	He also gained a shot at the 15th and parred the final three holes to catch Jeev after the Indian slipped up on the penultimate hole.         
	I was glad I was able to hit one close to the flag at the last there, a champagne-drenched McDowell said. That was sweet. I have worked unbelievable hard for this. Its a really special feeling right now.         
	Jeev opened an early three-stroke lead after a two-shot swing on the par-five fourth. But McDowell caught him after holing a five-foot putt for birdie at the 12th. A birdie at 16 gave Jeev the edge again but the Indian pushed his tee shot to the right of the green on the second last, where a golf buggy ran over his ball to add to the drama.         
	He was allowed a drop from the same spot but chipped 15 feet past the hole and failed to hole his par putt, opening the door for McDowell.           (AGENCIES)

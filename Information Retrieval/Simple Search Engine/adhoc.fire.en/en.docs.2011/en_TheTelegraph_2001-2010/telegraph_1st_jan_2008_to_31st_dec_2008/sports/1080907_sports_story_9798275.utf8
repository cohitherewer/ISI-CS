	It is hard to believe that four years ago I was sitting in the lobby of a hotel in midtown Manhattan, watching a video of one of Andys future opponents in the boys singles at the US Open.         
	I couldnt sleep because of the nervous excitement, and as we shared a room to save money in those days, I got up and went downstairs to go over the game plan once again. With the help of those videos, Andy went on to win the junior title that summer.         
	Looking back on that junior event, it is amazing to see that four of Andys opponents are now in the top 100 and that two of them, Argentinas Juan Martin Del Potro and American Sam Querrey, made the second week of the main event this week.         
	Andy defeated Del Potro in the quarter finals on Wednesday night, beating the teenager over four sets. The final weekend of the 2004 US Open was a very big moment for Andy, as that was when he won the junior title, but his match on Court 10 went largely unnoticed at Flushing Meadows.         
	Watched by about 300 people, it was a minor sideshow as public and media interest centred around Tim Henmans semi-final match against Roger Federer in the Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	It will be very different today for Andy. He will play in the biggest tennis arena in the world, the Arthur Ashe Stadium, in front of 23,000 spectators. The match will be televised all over the world and so millions of tennis fans will watch him take on Rafael Nadal, the world No.1 and the Wimbledon champion. These are the matches you dream about when you are in the juniors, when you are playing on Court 10 in front of 300 people. The atmosphere will be quite amazing.         
	This tournament has been another step forward for Andy. Hes in a grand slam semi-final for the first time and he will be up to fourth in the world rankings on Monday, which will be a career high. Nadal has had an incredible season, winning two slam titles and an Olympic gold medal, and he is the only top player Andy hasnt beaten.         
	Jamie had an amazing tournament as well. He shrugged off the disappointment of a first-round defeat in the mens doubles to reach the mixed doubles final.         
	He and his partner Liezel Huber, came close to taking the first set of Thursdays final with two set points against the vastly experienced pair of Leander Paes and Cara Black.         
	It was Jamies second slam final in 15 months, after winning the mixed title at Wimbledon last year with Serbian Jelena Jankovic, and at 22 he is still pretty young for a doubles player. So, this has been a good tournament for the boys. And it is not over yet.

                                                   Records meant to be broken: Pranab 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pranab Roy had a strong feeling on Friday night that the 52-year-old record held by Vinoo Mankad and his father would be erased.         
	Pranab, now in New Delhi for the ICL camp, had watched the proceedings closely from his Maurya Sheraton room as the South African pair of Neil McKenzie and Graeme Smith ended Day I unseparated at 405.         
	Records are meant to be broken (Virender) Sehwag and (Rahul) Dravid missed it in the Lahore Test in 2006 by a whisker (three runs). For how much longer would it have stood unscathed? a slightly disappointed Roy told The Telegraph.         
	He could not follow the match in the morning when, in the last ball of the 93rd over Smith took one run off Abdur Razzak to get past 413 and rewrite the record. Roy came to know about it after a scribe called him.         
	Obviously Im a wee bit disappointed. There were some Bengal sentiments attached to it. It was an Indian record, not just a record by my father and Mankad. When Sehwag-Dravid inched closer, I had thought it would remain with India. So obviously, Im disappointed, he said.         
	Im sure my father would have congratulated the duo (McKenzie and Smith) had he been alive today, Pranab said.         
	The former India captain passed away on February 4, 2001.

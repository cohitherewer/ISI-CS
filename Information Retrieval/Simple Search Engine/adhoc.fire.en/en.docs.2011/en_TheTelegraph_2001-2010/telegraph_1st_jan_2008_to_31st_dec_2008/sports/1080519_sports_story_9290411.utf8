                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev tied 40th, title for Finch 
                      
	Adare: Britains Richard Finch won the Irish Open by two strokes on Sunday after shooting a final round 70 at the Adare Manor course. The 30-year-old finished on 10-under par to capture his second tour win of the season after a maiden victory in the New Zealand Open last December.         
	The win boosted him to fifth place on the Order of Merit.         
	Chiles Felipe Aguilar, the Indonesian Open champion, carded a 70 to finish in second place on eight-under-par.         
	Briton Lee Westwood, Gary Murphy of Ireland, Dutchman Maarten Lafeber and Swedens Robert Karlsson were a shot further behind.         
	Britains Bradley Dredge, who held the overnight lead, finished in a share of eighth on five-under-par after a disappointing 76.         
	Indias Jeev Milkha Singh, joint leader on Day I, finished tied 40th after carding a final round two-over 74. He finished at three over 291 for the meet.         
	On Saturday, Jeev stuttered to a three-over 75 in the penultimate round to slip to tied 36th.         
	I didnt change anything. Im just doing everything better, Finch said on Sunday. Im still in shock. I tried all last night and today not to think about winning because I didnt want to get ahead of myself. I was really pleased with how I was mentally. I felt calm and in control.         
	Finch is now 10th in the Ryder Cup standings         
	Im not thinking about that, he said. I havent even played in a major yet and my goal this year was to try to qualify for one of those.           (AGENCIES)

	Knoxville: An erratic Arjun Atwal turned in his worst card of the week to slip three places on the leader-board and sign off tied ninth in the Nationwide Tours Knoxville Open.         
	The Orlando-based golfer finished with a total of 13-under 275, six strokes behind winner Australian Jarrod Lyle (69), who beat American Chris Kink (67) in a play-off.         
	Atwal looked good for a top-five finish but it all went haywire for him as he stumbled to a double-bogey on the second hole itself.He stroked in three birdies between the third and sixth holes but a dropped shot on the eighth brought him back to square one.         
	In Munich, Shiv Kapur and Jyoti Randhawa turned in identical cards of one-under 71 in the final round to sign off tied 40th and tied 43rd, respectively, in the BMW International Open.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag took it away, says Arthur
                                                   Sehwag took it away, says Arthur
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: South Africa coach Mickey Arthur conceded at the news conference that he had not visualised the game taking such a course in his wildest dreams. Arthur admitted that Virender Sehwag had taken the game away from them.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On Sehwags knock         
	I think thats the best Test-match innings Ive ever seen. The way he played today was absolutely amazing. We tried to attack him, defended against him, tried to bowl straight, bowled wide, over the wicket, round the wicket, did everything possible... And he countered us.         
	If his style makes it difficult         
	Of course We were trying to keep the run rate down but it wasnt possible against Viru (Sehwag). He played all possible shots. I never though in my wildest dreams that such a scoring rate was possible. He scores so quickly and in unconventional areas. The moment we changed a fielder he reverse-swept and hit over square leg. It was a fantastic innings and obviously put India in a very good position.         
	The match         
	Theres a lot of cricket still to be played. India are probably in a really good position now and its up to us to counter that early. I do think that if we get Viru out quickly, we have a good chance of keeping that run-rate in check and making it a lot longer for them to get ahead of us.         
	If they would decide on the strategy to counter Sehwag tonight         
	I dont there would be too much of a buzz in hotel tonight. I think at 7pm the boys will all be sleeping         
	Was it the heat or Sehwag that has dented South Africas chances         
	Its a bit of both. There wasnt much wrong with the planning but you can hardly do anything when the onslaught is so severe. Viru was extraordinary and took it away from us.         
	If he found Sehwag to be the hardest hitter         
	Thats debatable Whats special is the way he scores, making it difficult for the opposition to contain him.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leander keeps eye on London Olympics
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Twelve years have passed since Leander Paes became only the second athlete in independent India to win an individual medal at the Olympics. Most of those who played on the circuit with him in 1996 have either retired or are only playing for fun.         
	But Paes hasnt lost his passion for the game yet. So much so that on Tuesday the Indian Davis Cup captain promised to make an all-out effort to win the doubles gold medal at the Beijing Olympics.         
	Paes, who will partner Mahesh Bhupathi, said: It is a great honour for any player to represent his country at the highest level and its our responsibility to bring the honour back home. Please note, Beijing is not going to be my last Olympics. I may continue to play till the London Olympics in 2012.         
	He also dismissed reports that his differences with Bhupathi could hamper their performance during the August 8-24 extravaganza.         
	Stressing that he and Bhupathi have perfect understanding, Paes said: We have played together for around eight long years. So, it would be wrong to say that there is a lack of understanding between us. We two are perfectly capable of winning the Olympic gold.         
	You have watched the Davis Cup tie against Japan here recently, Paes said. It proved that we can still rely on each other and win crucial matches. Our performance was extremely satisfactory.         
	Everything is proceeding in the right direction. We have recently played in the Davis Cup together and it paid off. It was a tremendous performances after playing together after a long time, Paes said.

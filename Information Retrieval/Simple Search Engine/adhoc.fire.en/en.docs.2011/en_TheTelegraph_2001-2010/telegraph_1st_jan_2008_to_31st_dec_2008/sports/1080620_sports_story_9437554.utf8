	Calcutta: Play on Day II of the PGTI Players Championship at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) started late by a couple of hours on Thursday owing to soggy conditions.         
	But it had little effect on overnight joint leader Harendra Guptas concentration as he shot a four under 65 to take his tournament total to seven under 98.         
	Gupta enjoyed a three-stroke lead at the end of day and led the field among 81 golfers who finished Round II on Thursday.         
	Twenty seven players are yet to finish the second round out of a total field of 108. New Delhis Ashok Kumar was three strokes behind Gupta in second place. Ashoks total moved to four under 101 after he carded a two under 67 in the second round.         
	Its quite a good score considering the wet conditions, a confident Gupta said at the end of his round.         
	On Thursday, par for the course was 69 as three par four holes, the ninth, 10th and 16th were reduced to par 3 at the start of the round. The second round will now be completed on Friday morning before the cut is made. The third round will commence thereafter.         
	City-based Rahil Gangjee (34, 69) and Chandigarhs Ranjit Singh (35, 68) are currently tied third at two under 103. Ranjit Singh from Calcutta, Vishal Singh, Chiragh Kumar, Digvijay Singh, Manav Jaini, Dayal Singh, Anirban Lahiri and Rahul Ganapathy are all in tied fifth place with an identical total of one under 104.         
	Indian Masters champion S.S.P. Chowrasia (35, 70), Arjun Singh, Shankar Das, Uttam Singh Mundy, Vinod Kumar, Mohammed Siddikur Rehman and Divyanshu Bajaj (amateur) are all tied 13th at even par 105.         
	Gupta, who was playing his third tournament at the RCGC, reached the top of the leaderboard as a result of his bogey-free 65. He had fired three under 33 in the first round.         
	Guptas second round included birdies on the seventh, 12th, 14th and 15th hole. Ashok Kumar (34, 67), currently placed second at four under 101, scored birdies on the third, ninth, 16th and a bogey on the 18th.         
	Gangjees round of even par 69 was marked by birdies on the first, second, fourth, sixth, 15th, 18th and bogeys on the third and 10th. He also made double bogeys on the seventh and 11th.         
	I have been working on my swing for the last two years I think it is getting better, said Gupta, who won the Players Championship event in Chandigarh.         
	My hitting and putting was excellent today. I was particularly happy with a long 26-feet putt that I made for a birdie on the 12th. I hope to continue my good form over the next two days, said Gupta.         
	Second-placed Ashok said: A lot depends on my putting from here on as I was finding it difficult to read the speed of the greens. However, my hitting was good as I hit most of the fairways.         
	Chowrasias round included birdies on the second, 12th, 14th, and bogeys on the third, fourth, 10th and 18th.

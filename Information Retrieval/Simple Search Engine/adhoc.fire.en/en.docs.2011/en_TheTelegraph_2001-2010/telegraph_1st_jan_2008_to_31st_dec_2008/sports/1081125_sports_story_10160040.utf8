The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zimbabwe fall short
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Zimbabwe fall short
                      
	Harare: Muttiah Muralidharan took two wickets in an effective final over to thwart Zimbabwes victory push as Sri Lanka won the third one-day International by five runs on Monday.         
	With Zimbabwe needing 10 runs from the 28th and final over to chase down a target of 172, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene tossed the ball to Muralidharan.         
	Murali trapped Stuart Matsikenyeri, who had scored 19 off 10 balls, leg-before with the first ball and then conceded just four runs, before having Tawanda Mupariwa stumped off the final delivery, when six runs were needed.         
	Muralidharan finished with two for 20 in six overs, fellow spinner Ajantha Mendis took two for 36 and seamer Thilan Thushara two for 31 as Zimbabwe went 0-3 down in the five-match series.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Money will be no factor in getting next coach
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Money will be no factor in getting next coach
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohinder Amarnath is the top choice to be the next Bengal coach. However, the only hitch in his appointment appears to be his TV commitments.         
	The former India batsman and member of the 1983 World Cup winning team is currently in the UK.         
	The negotiations with Amarnath are being directly conducted by the newly elected CAB president, Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	The Telegraph understands money is not going to be a factor in getting the best person available  whether it be Amarnath or anyone else.         
	Bengal were relegated to the Plate division last season under Bharat Aruns coaching.         
	Dalmiya, who had a 20-minute closed-door meeting with his newly elected office bearers at the CAB on Wednesday, stressed on the need to talk to players and find if it was necessary to participate in the ongoing off-season fitness camp supervised by Adrian Le Roux at the Eden Gardens.         
	We will talk to the players within a couple of days and check how this camp is helping them, a newly elected office bearer said.         
	If the players feel it is not needed, we will scrap the second one slated for August, he added.

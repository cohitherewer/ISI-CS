The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Itll be tough for Ajantha: Kumble
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Itll be tough for Ajantha: Kumble
            A CORRESPONDENT                              
	Colombo: Indian captain Anil Kumble sought to put some pressure on Sri Lankan spin-sensation Ajantha Mendis and said the youngster would find the going tough against Indias star-studded line-up.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The threat of Mendis         
	We discuss every bowler. Its his first Test match. Lets not forget that As a youngster when you play your first Test match youre obviously nervous. That factor is there and if you look at our batting strength, most of them have played 100 Test matches. We respect every bowler. The two bowlers who have done well over the years are Murali and Vaas and you cant discount that. Its a matter of handling the bowlers you face and taking the opportunities that come your way as a batting unit.         
	On what the team needs to do to win?         
	If you want to win a Test match you have to play well in both innings. Here the pitches favour batting in the second innings but this does not mean that the batsmen relax more in first innings or that the bowlers try harder in the first innings. The bowlers will be thinking about how they can pick up twenty wickets and the batsmen about how they can score the maximum runs in the first innings.         
	The challenging weather conditions         
	The way we go about training, fitness and hydration are a factor in managing the conditions when we play in heat and humidity like this. All of us are experienced enough to handle this. There are a couple of guys who need to take extra care and they are aware of this and preparation has already started. Paddy is doing the role of fitness trainer. If you look at the schedule there isnt that much gap to focus only on training.         
	On the wicket         
	Its going to be challenging. The wickets have favoured the batsmen on earlier tours. We now have a much better understanding of the conditions. Also the quality  we now have a balanced combination.         
	The experimentation with the referral system         
	Its the first time for me as well. It will obviously be helpful for the umpires and also for the teams. I cant really say much till it is experimented because its something new. The umpires also make mistakes. There are times when they may not pick up a certain edge and the ball hits pad and you are given out lbw. Those kind of referrals may matter and might change the course of the game as well.         
	Whether the use of technology will be helpful         
	The technology is there and we are using whatever technology we feel confident with. Its an experiment and well all know at the end of the series whether technology will help or will not help.         
	Is too much change happening in the sport         
	We need to change. Traditions of the game are important and everybody respects that. But its also a fact that millions are watching on television. In tennis line decisions are accepted now. In cricket we have already accepted the third umpire ruling on run outs and stumpings. I dont think we are saying that umpires are redundant. They are an integral part of the system.         
	Whether Sri Lanka will miss Jayasuriya         
	Hes a big player. It really helps when you dont have someone of his calibre and experience at the top of the order in the opposition. Hes a big match player but Sri Lanka also have other quality batsmen. Mahela, Sangakkara, others have done well in recent times and we need to respect all batsmen.

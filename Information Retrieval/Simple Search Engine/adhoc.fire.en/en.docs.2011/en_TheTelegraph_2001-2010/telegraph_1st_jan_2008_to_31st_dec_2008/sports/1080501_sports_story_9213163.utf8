  - AFC CUP 
  -   Red-and-golds fate will now be known in Yemen         A STAFF REPORTER            Action during the East Bengal-Safa SC AFC Cup group B match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Even the much-hyped Indian Premier League would fall flat on its face if the cricket on offer isnt good enough. The glitz, glamour and razzmatazz would simply fail to bring crowds to the stadium if the cricket is listless and uninspiring.         
	So for a game which doesnt enjoy the hype and hoopla associated with cricket in India, it is important that the quality of football on offer is such that despite infrastructural and organisational shortcomings, the masses are drawn to the stadium.         
	Going by the AFC Cup group B tie between East Bengal and Lebanons Safa SC though, the crazy few who braved the heat and humidity to be at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday, must be making a silent resolve never to make such a mistake again. Even the footballers and match officials seemed to be waiting for the final whistle.         
	Truth to tell, the 0-0 draw was a fair result. East Bengal, already hamstrung by the absence of their man among goals  striker Edmilson who was red-carded in their last outing at home against Jordans Al Wihdat  became handicapped owing to Syed Rahim Nabis calf muscle strain.         
	Though the spirited Nabi stayed on for 69 minutes, he was far from his natural self. Without a proper striker and key midfielder Alvito DCunha less than hundred per cent fit, the hosts had little chance of scoring against a side who are yet to be beaten.         
	The result brightened Safas chances of making it to the last eight. And with only an away match versus Ahli Sanaa in Yemen left, it would be quite tough for East Bengal to reach the quarter finals. Even a win, too, may not be enough.         
	East Bengals Nigerian recruit, Ibe Ikechukwu Gift, was saddled with the responsibility of an attacking medio and he did precious little except in the very first minute when his scrambled centre, after dodging two Safa defenders, found Nabi.         
	The sprightly Nabi jumped with good timing but the header was slightly off target.         
	For the rest of the 45 minutes, save a 25-yard right footer from Surkumar which had Safa goalkeeper dive to his left and fist it out, the hosts didnt venture beyond the rival half-line.         
	The Lebanese side are without their best striker, Aamer Khan, who has stayed back for his wedding. Their three foreign recruits are unimpressive. But coach Samir Saad can boast of his defence.         
	Except the match against Al Wihdat, Safa are yet to concede a goal. They made sporadic attacks on East Bengal box, the highlight of which was a free kick on the 17th minute just outside the box. They failed to capitalise on that opportunity and few more set piece movements in the course of the match.         
	Hamza Abboud impressed with a few solo moves and the scene was little different in the second half.         
	Alvito, who clearly looked unfit again, can however take the credit for East Bengals lone sitter.         
	A clinical pass which knifed the Safa defence in half and came in the way of an opportune Snehashish Chakraborty, was wasted. Snehashish got the goalie in a one-on-one and his outstep jab was saved by the Safa custodian.         
	In the 73rd minute, that would be the only worthwhile move to write home about.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United rally to beat Arsenal

	London: Manchester United surged six points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 2-1 comeback victory over Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday that also snuffed out the London clubs slim title hopes. Emmanuel Adebayor put Arsenal ahead early in the second half but a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty levelled and Owen Hargreaves won it with a 72nd-minute free kick.         
	The result leaves United on 80 points, six clear of Chelsea, who host Wigan Athletic on Monday, with Arsenal on 71. United, who have a far superior goal difference, still have to play Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.         
	Earlier on Sunday, Liverpool tightened their grip on fourth place when superbly-taken goals from Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres and a late Andriy Voronin effort gave them a 3-1 Anfield win over Blackburn Rovers. They have 66 points to the 61 of Everton, who drew 1-1 at Birmingham City on Saturday.         
	Arsenal travelled back to the north-west knowing they needed a win to save their season having been knocked out of the Champions League at Anfield on Tuesday. They made most of the running in an open first half but were let down by some unconvincing finishing, especially by Adebayor.         
	However, the Togo striker did find the target three minutes into the second half, in controversial circumstances. Robin van Persie crossed from the left and with Uniteds defenders leaving the ball for keeper Edwin Van der Sar, Adebayor nipped in between them to put the ball into the net with his arm.         
	Just as they had in their midweek classic at Anfield, Arsenal handed the initiative straight back through poor defending, this time William Gallas handling in the box to give away a needless penalty five minutes later.         
	Ronaldo, forced to take the spot kick twice after the referee blew for encroachment, duly dispatched it for his 38th goal of the season.         
	United always looked dangerous and got the winner when Hargreaves took responsibility ahead of Ronaldo and planted a perfectly-executed 20-metre free kick over the wall and into the unprotected half of Jens Lehmanns goal.

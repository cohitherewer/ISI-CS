	Karachi: Twin unbeaten half-centuries by openers Salman Butt and Nasir Jamshed on Friday ensured a consolation win for Pakistan as they guided the hosts to a comprehensive 10-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their last Super Four match of the Asia Cup.         
	The two left-handed batsmen stroked their way to 116 in only 19.4 overs after Bangladesh were bowled out for a paltry 115 runs in 38.2 overs, the lowest total of the tournament, after electing to bat at the National Stadium.         
	Butt (56 ..) and Jamshed (52 ..) faced no difficulties in piling up their second consecutive fruitful stand of the tournament. Jamshed took 52 balls to reach his fourth half-century hitting five boundaries and two sixes.         
	Earlier, Bangladesh batsmen collapsed against a disciplined Pakistan attack. The visitors batted poorly after winning the toss in heavily overcast conditions to fold their innings in just 38.2 overs.         
	Pakistani pacers Abdur Rauf (3/24) and Rao Iftikhar (2/20) bowled well to unsettle the Bangladeshis.           (AGENCIES)

            A STAFF REPORTER            Dalmiya at the CAB on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The court-appointed observer Justice Santosh Kumar Phoujdar on Saturday upheld the oppositions protest against the nomination of Subhasish Sarkar from Malda DSA, but overruled the one against Howrah Unions Indranath Dey for the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections.         
	Sarkar, who had filed his nomination for the vice-presidents post, wont be able to vote on Tuesday as he was unable to produce the required documents to prove his legitimacy as the representative of Malda DSA.         
	The evidence put forth by the Jagmohan Dalmiya group, regarding their objection against Dey, was not enough to prove that the Howrah Union secretary had signed any agreement with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	Justice Phoujdar said Deys participation in the elections couldnt be barred based on the CAB constitution, but added that his judgement would have no bearing on the CAB in future. Thus, 119 authorised representatives will cast their vote in the elections as the nomination of another club (for technical reasons) has been cancelled.         
	Santanu Saha, a club representative in the Malda DSA, said that no election has been held in his association for the current term, and thus no executive committee has been formed. Sarkar filed his nomination on July 18 and a meeting was convened in the district magistrates office on July 23 for the approval of his representation. There is also no current executive committee as no election has been held for the current year, Saha, who is also a councillor of the English Bazar municipality, said.         
	The cancellation of Sarkars nomination would mean that there would be no representative from the districts among the CAB office-bearers in the next term.         
	The 18 districts generally have a representative among the office-bearers. But because of Sarkars blunder, the districts wont have a representative this time. This is very sad for them, former BCCI joint-secretary Goutam Das Gupta, a Dalmiya aide, said.         
	The cancellation of Sarkars nomination wouldnt hurt their numbers, incumbent president Prasun Mukherjee said.         
	Dalmiya said that the end of scrutiny was a welcome relief for everybody.

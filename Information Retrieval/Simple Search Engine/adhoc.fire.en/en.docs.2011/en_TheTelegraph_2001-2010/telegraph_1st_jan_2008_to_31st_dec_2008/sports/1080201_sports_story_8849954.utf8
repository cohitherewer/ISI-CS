	Calcutta: Carlos Roberto Pereiras strategy paid off. Playing according to the plan, Mohun Bagan earned a crucial 2-1 victory over Churchill Brothers in a Round XIV match of the ONGC I-League at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday evening. 
    
	While captain Bhaichung Bhutias fourth-minute strike saw the green and maroons surge ahead, Man of the Match Habibur Rehman Mondal made it 2-0 after 31 minutes. Not to be outdone, Churchill hit back in the 38th minute via Mboyo Iyomi, who converted an Okolie Odafe pass from a huddle inside the Bagan box in an exhilarating first half. 
    
	However, the hosts were pushed to the wall in the second half as they went into a defensive shell. 
    
	Churchill, who held Mohun Bagan 1-1 in the first leg, started back-to-back forays into the rival citadel. It was due to the combined effort of Peter Odafe and N.S. Manju that the dangerous Odafe was kept at bay. 
    
	The win took Mohun Bagan to fourth spot with 24 points while Churchill Brothers are second with 26.

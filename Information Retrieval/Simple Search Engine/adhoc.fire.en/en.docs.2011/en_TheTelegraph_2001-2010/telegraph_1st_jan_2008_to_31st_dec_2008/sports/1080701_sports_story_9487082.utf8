The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rampaging Lanka win it in style 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rampaging Lanka win it in style 
                      
	Karachi: A bludgeoning hundred by Sanath Jayasuriya (130) and an elegant century by Kumar Sangakkara (121) secured Sri Lankas place in the final of the Asia Cup as they comfortably beat Bangladesh by 158 runs in their Super Four match here on Monday.         
	With two victories in as many matches at Super Four stage coupled with two points they carried forward from the group stage, the defending champions took their points tally to six.         
	The Sri Lankan openers slammed impressive centuries en route to their record breaking 201-run first wicket partnership, which powered their team to a massive 332 for eight after electing to bat on a good batting track.         
	Lankan spin-wizard Muttiah Muralidharan ripped through the Bangladesh middle-order, claiming five wickets.         
	Now the battle for the other place in the final has been shifted to arch-rivals India and Pakistan.         
	An Indian win would end all speculation about the team as they, like Sri Lankans, have two bonus points and one more victory is enough to seal a place for the summit-show.         
	Earlier, Jaysuriya celebrated his 39th birthday by scoring 130 runs while Sangakkara (121) made his third century of the tournament underlining his current form.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies still not paid: Reports
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aussies still not paid: Reports
                      
	Melbourne: In what could snowball into an embarrassment for the BCCI, some Australian cricketers, who participated in the cash-rich IPL, claim they are yet to receive the wages for their brief stints despite repeated reminders to their respective franchise owners.         
	Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) chief Paul Marsh has claimed that the players, who returned home after playing in the IPL for the first two weeks due to national commitments, were frustrated with the impasse.         
	The Sun Herald quoted an Australian player as saying that his franchise was not clearing his money despite claiming on three occasions that his wage was on its way.         
	First I was told it would be in two weeks, the player said.         
	That passed by and I was told it would be in the following week. Then I was told it would be in the next few days. I just said, Ill believe it when I see it, he added.         
	Another player was reportedly trying to get his money in instalments as he needed it urgently to make mortgage payments.         
	The newspapers report said one of the players got his payment only a few days ago but that too after a lot of effort. The top Aussie cricketers including skipper Ricky Ponting, Brett Lee, Michael Hussey, Simon Katich and allrounder Andrew Symonds returned home after their first couple of weeks in the IPL.         
	Marsh said the ACA was keeping a close eye on the matter and will assist the players in getting their due from the IPL franchisees.         
	Its something were aware of. Theres still a few that havent been paid, Marsh said. Its certainly something weve got our eye on but its not something that were panicking about. We just want to get a result as soon as we can, he added.         
	I dont want to blow this up into something that its not, but I also do want to sort it out as quickly as possible, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Kings XI Punjab CEO Neil Maxwell on Sunday said clearing the money was a time-taking process as it involved taxation issues.         
	Maxwell, who also manages top Aussie cricketers like Lee, Hussey and Watson, admitted the payments were slowly being made in phases.         
	The players are being paid in instalments because there are a number of taxation issues. It is the first instalment that is taking the most time because its not simple as a lot of taxes are involved, Maxwell said in a television interview. Maxwell said too much was being read into the .           (AGENCIES)

	IPL auction next week         
	Mumbai: The BCCI-backed Indian Premier League (IPL) will conduct a second players auction next week to enable franchises, that have money left after the initial auction from the $5 million cap, supplement their base.         
	We plan to hold an internal players auction next week for only the team management who have money left (in their kitty) to supplement their base, said Lalit Modi, IPL commissioner and chairman. Modi felt that gradually the IPL would become a part of the ICCs Future Tours Programme. We need to realise that the IPL is here to stay. So we will sit and discuss this with the ICC to ensure that IPL becomes part of the FTP, said Modi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atapattu backs Sourav
                                                   Atapattu backs Sourav
                      
	New Delhi: Former Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu feels packing the side with youngsters affects the balance and Sourav Ganguly is not yet a spent force in ODIs.         
	Had I been in Souravs place, I would have been disappointed, Atapattu said. I feel you need a judicious blend of youth and experience and there you need senior players, he said.         
	Besides, its unfair to treat senior players such as Sourav and Rahul Dravid the way they have been dealt with.         
	This is not how you treat these players. If the selectors had decided to leave them out, they should have passed on the message to them that they are running out of time. They should have been treated with some dignity, he said.         
	Fellow ICL player and former New Zealand allrounder Chris Harris, however, did not find anything wrong and said the side under Mahendra Singh Dhoni has done an excellent job.         
	Even without the senior players, they are still a fantastic side.         
	Though its not right to dump seniors without giving them a chance to leave with dignity, I think Indias policy to go with a young bunch has clicked, said Harris, who leads Hyderabad Heroes in the ICL event..

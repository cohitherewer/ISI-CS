The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John: Depending on strategy, Dhoni could be Test captain
                                                                                                                                                                                                       John: Depending on strategy, Dhoni could be Test captain
    - The Australians have already seen Kumble at the helm, says former coach           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan                                 
	Calcutta: Like Team India coach Gary Kirsten, John Buchanan too feels Mahendra Singh Dhoni is ready for the Test captaincy, but his elevation  if its to be done immediately  should be guided by our strategy in the forthcoming series versus Australia.         
	I would stick with Anil Kumble, but also look at the strategy to be adopted against the best team Giving the job to (ODI and Twenty20 captain) Dhoni would probably catch Australia off guard They have, after all, already seen Kumble at the helm in Tests and know what to expect from him Dhoni could surprise, Buchanan, who coached Australia with phenomenal success for close to eight years, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Friday evening, shortly before returning home (Brisbane) at the end of a Kolkata Knight Riders-related trip, hed added: Besides strategy, you need to look at whether you want Dhoni to invigorate the Test side in the manner of the one-day team Dhoni has certainly changed the look of Indias one-day side Having said all that, its not my call, though.         
	According to Buchanan, who was in the coachs chair in four series versus India  1999-2000 (won) and 2003-2004 (drawn) at home and 2000-2001 (lost) and 2004-2005 (won) in India  both teams would be somewhat nervous going into the first Test, in Bangalore, from October 9.         
	India lost the last Test series, in Sri Lanka, and there are definitely issues around the Australians Whoever wins in Bangalore will, I guess, have a real momentum going into the remainder of the series (three Tests)         
	The side hasnt been picked as yet, but Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden are recovering from injuries and Brett Lee (just divorced) and Andrew Symonds (at the centre of a fishing controversy) have been having problems of a personal nature So, its going to be very interesting         
	While Ponting has been off cricket from the end of June, Haydens last appearance for Australia was as far back as early March.         
	Its not easy coming to India and straightaway hitting form Im saying that from experience, Buchanan remarked.         
	He expects the batsmen, more than the bowlers, to make the difference.         
	Talking about the Fab Four (Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S.Laxman), Buchanan said hed retain them for the first Test, at least.         
	They had a rough time in Sri Lanka, but Id go with experience, certainly at the start of the series All four, of course, wont be in the XI if the strategy is to play five specialist bowlers.         
	Asked if an India-Australia Test series could actually be on a par with the Ashes (as has been spoken about at different times), Buchanan replied: I dont think so The Ashes will remain at the top with, I suppose, an India-Pakistan series getting the highest billing, emotional and otherwise, in these parts         
	The next Ashes contest is in the summer of 2009. In the near future, then, its the India-Australia clash that Buchanan will be following with considerable interest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne: Weve got the momentum
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Warne: Weve got the momentum
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Jaipur: Shane Warne is planning to open an academy for the spinners in India.         
	The spin wizard, who is participating in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as coach and captain of Rajasthan Royals, said he was so impressed with the general standard of spinners in India that he wont mind sharing his magical skills with the youngsters.         
	India have some fine spinners all over the country, Warne said. Even those spinners who help us out in the nets here are of good quality. Some day, I wont mind opening an academy for the spinners in India. If there could be an academy for fast bowlers in India, why not open a similar academy for spin bowlers?         
	With three victories under his belt in the IPL, Warne looked relaxed when he met the media after Rajasthan Royals practice session. He answered a varied range of questions and promised to beat Kolkata Knight Riders on Thursday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Making a comeback after losing the first match         
	We didnt get off to the best of starts but knew our preparation has been good. Each player was assigned specific roles. Weve been on the road for a while and have done well. Weve chased a 200 plus total, and what we did in Bangalore instilled a lot of confidence... Weve got the momentum, which is important in Twenty20. But we know its a funny game, anyone can beat anyone. Weve come out very well so far and have to stick to the basics and execute our plans. Our squad is skilful though little inexperienced. It may show at some stage of the tournament.         
	Your game plan         
	Most teams have more or less the same plan Its a question of executing them better on the day. We are a bit ahead of the pack with our field placings and the way we have bowled. I dont think many teams have done well to anticipate us, and some of them are now copying us. We are always coming up with new stuff, which is what you have to do in this tournament. We look at conditions, wickets, opposition and then decide on the combination. We have a well-balanced squad with good variations in Jadeja, Watson, Akmal, Tanvir, and Mascarenhas. We have a good base of Indian players as well. Knight Riders played yesterday Theyre going to travel today all day. Tomorrow its a day game and its going to be boiling hot so its better to bat first and keep them on the field. I am sure they will bounce back. They have lost two in a row, it will hurt. It is going to be hard for them with new players coming in but that can be dangerous. We have all bases covered and look forward to the challenge.         
	The feeling after winning three games in a row         
	We never called ourselves underdogs, the media did. We believe we have a very good squad that can reach the semi-finals. There are still 10 games to go, expectations are high now. I want to show the world what the young players can do Our team is a nice blend of experience and youth. Our slogan is simple: attack, attack and attack.         
	On the suspension of Harbhajan Singh and Sreesanths on-field behaviour         
	I dont see any reason why I should comment on that matter. I am here to play and have a team to look after. I am busy with that. Let the authority decide what they have to do with such problems.         
	The Indian spinners playing in the IPL         
	Ya, most of them are really good. In India, you find them in plenty. From my team, I can say that (Ravindra) Jadeja and (Yousuf) Pathan are excellent players. I had talk with (Piyush) Chawla that day He was disappointed that he couldnt bowl much. Now he is doing well. I am also looking forward to watch Murali Kartik tomorrow.

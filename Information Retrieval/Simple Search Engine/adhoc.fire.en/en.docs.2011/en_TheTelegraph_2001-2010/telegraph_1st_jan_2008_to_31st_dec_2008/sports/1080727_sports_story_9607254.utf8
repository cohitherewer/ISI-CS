            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Jockey D.K. Ashish booted home three winners for trainer Arti Doctor, on Saturday, thanks largely to his fellow-rider C. Alford who appeared to be off colour during the afternoon. It suited Ashishs cause, particularly, in the trophy events -- the Great Tribute Cup and the Sans Ame Cup which were claimed by Artis Smarty Pant and Queen Of Hearts respectively. The winning duo also lifted the 1,800m Flying Glance Handicap, the curtain raiser when Sea Monarch scored a decisive victory. The Whispering Grass Cup was, however, annexed by trainer Patrick Quinns heavily fancied runner, Great Heart.

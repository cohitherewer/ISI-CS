The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Goalie saves Md. Sp.
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Goalie saves Md. Sp.
            A STAFF REPORTER            Vimal Pariyar                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting registered their second victory in the I-League here at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday beating Vasco Sports Club 1-0.         
	They won because they scored the all-important goal but the performance failed to bring a smile to coach Shabbir Alis face.         
	The match was halted for 10 minutes as smoke covered the ground.         
	Pariyar ensured three points in the 86th minute with an opportunistic header. Sovan Chakraborty ran down the right flank and tried to find somebody inside the Vasco box with a centre. There was nobody but his swerving centre dragged Vasco custodian Milagrio Medeira out of his fort. He could not get to the ball and Pariyar ran in to head home on one bounce.         
	Vasco would have been up by at least two goals in the first half itself had Tharangachan not been superhuman under the bars.         
	In the 31st minute, Mohammedan Sporting had their worst scare. Agnelo DSouzas cross from the right found Abhishek, whose powerful right-footer was thwarted by the invincible Tharangachan. But the rebound went straight to Elvino Fernandes whose volley hit the crossbar. Sherzod Nazarov tried to strike with the rebound but by then Tharangachan was back on his feet to catch it.         
	Smoke filled the ground as soon as this heart-stopping drama got over. Tharangachan must have felt it was divine intervention to help him catch his breath. In fact, the smoke was coming out of the hostel situated under the galleries. The purpose was to kill the mosquitoes and it ended up halting the match for 10 minutes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Leander chooses not to react to allegations
                                                     Leander chooses not to react to allegations
            OUR BUREAU            Prakash Amritraj and Leander Paes after beating Uzbekistan earlier this month                           
	Calcutta/New Delhi: Indias Davis Cup captain Leander Paes, who doesnt have to prove either his commitment or credentials, has chosen not to react to the revolt by his teammates. However, sources close to him are convinced that one-time buddy and doubles partner Mahesh Bhupathi has been instrumental in instigating the others in the Davis Cup squad.         
	On Saturday, Rohan Bopanna had sent an email to All India Tennis Association (AITA) secretary Anil Khanna  with teammates Mahesh Bhupathi, Prakash Amritraj and Karan Rastogi as co-signatories  stating that the players had lost faith in Paess captaincy. The email ended by saying that the rebels wont play under Paes any more. Indias next Davis Cup engagement is against Japan in New Delhi from April 11.         
	It may be recalled that the iconic Paes, a seven-time Grand Slam champion, had opted to field rookie Somdev Dev Varman on Day I of the Davis Cup tie versus Uzbekistan saying that first-choice Prakash had a stomach sickness. Prakash, however, had insisted that he was ready to play.         
	Contacted by The Telegraph on Sunday evening, Paes only said at this point I have no reaction.         
	Sources close to him though are convinced that its an extension of the friction between Paes and Bhupathi that has been going on for quite some time. Paess decision not to field Prakash on Day I  a decision which later turned out to be a masterstroke  came in handy to whip up anti-Paes sentiments.         
	It appears that Prakashs father, the iconic Vijay, may also have quietly given his blessings to the revolt that has few parallels in Indian sport.         
	Meanwhile, Khanna, clearly shaken by the latest and potentially the most damaging controversy to hit Indian tennis, cut a brave face on Sunday.         
	The association will do everything possible to settle differences. An executive council meeting will be held before the Japan tie. While we cant give any dates right now, we will obviously try to clear the air and bring the warring parties to the table, Khanna said.         
	It couldnt be confirmed, but AITA sources said the executive council would form a committee to address the issue. Resolving the dispute through dialogue is on the agenda. Toppling Paes isnt an option, the sources added.         
	Akhtar Ali, former Davis Cupper and coach and now an AITA selector, made things clearer by saying no drastic step was on the cards.         
	I have had some communication with Khanna. We want to talk to the players individually and together as well. We will try to find out what exactly the problem is.         
	Let them give it to us in writing that they dont want Paes as captain. After that, we will see, said Ali. Above all, we will try to persuade them to play under him. We dont want to jeopardise our chances versus Japan.         
	While the AITA is optimistic it will be very surprising if Prakash and Bopanna, who went after Paes in the email, do a volte-face.         
	Rastogi, who is now out of the Davis Cup team, seems to be the weakest link with AITA sources indicating that he has already done a turnaround and buried the hatchet with the captain.

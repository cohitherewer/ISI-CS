            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Srinagar: Bengal coach Krishnendu Roy looked satisfied after his teams goalless draw with Goa in the Group B quarter final league match against Goa on Friday.         
	Considering the fact that it was our first match, I am happy with the boys performance, the former defender said. We dominated the first half and with little more luck could have bagged full points.         
	The Bengal coach, however, admitted that a victory could have been more assuring for his team at this stage of the tournament. We are in a tough group and a victory over Goa would have gone a long way in helping up reach the last four. After all, Karnataka have got three points today.

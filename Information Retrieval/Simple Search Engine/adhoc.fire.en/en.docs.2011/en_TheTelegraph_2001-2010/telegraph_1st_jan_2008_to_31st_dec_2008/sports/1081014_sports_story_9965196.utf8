The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin misses Laras mark, saves match
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sachin misses Laras mark, saves match
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Bangalore: None had imagined that the hovering dark clouds would bring such hard luck. At 2.52 pm, an eerie silence descended over the Chinnaswamy turf. The fans were stunned into disbelief for the second time in this Test. One could even hear a pin drop!         
	With only 15 needed to overtake Brian Laras world record of 11,953 runs, Sachin Tendulkar drove straight to Michael Clarke at short cover. It was Cameron Whites maiden Test wicket. While the Aussies looked a bit surprised, the leg-spinner was still trying to realise the significance of the wicket as Sachin trudged back.         
	Sachin had set himself up well for the moment of reckoning, showing remarkable caution in battling through 179 minutes for his 49 runs. He was stuck on 48 for 11 balls, and put together two valuable partnerships  53 with Gautam Gambhir and 61 with V. V. S Laxman  that all but secured the draw. Perhaps the enormity of the occasion had got to Sachin as well!         
	For the spectators, it was all over. The dismissal sparked a near exodus from the stadium.         
	Laxman and Sourav Ganguly survived the tricky last 70 minutes that also saw two interruptions because of bad light. Set a target of 299 in 83 overs, India finished on 177 for four. Laxman and Sourav remained unbeaten on 42 and 26, respectively.         
	As Ricky Ponting admitted later, the Australians dearly missed a quality spinner on the final day. Both White and Michael Clarke were modest by international standards and rarely managed to instil doubts in the minds of the batsmen.         
	Ponting had hoped to set up a gripping contest when he declared at 228 for six inside the first hour of play. Virender Sehwags early dismissal, though, put paid to Indias hopes of a chase.         
	In Sydney earlier this year, the Australians gave themselves 71 overs to take 10 wickets. They had an abundance of runs to make an all-out effort. It had appeared that the declaration was too late until Clarke claimed three wickets in five balls to pull off a controversial yet sensational victory.         
	Thankfully, none of that rancour spilled onto this Test but the tension was palpable when Laxman and Ponting had an exchange of words that also involved Sachin. There is no doubt that the conditions and circumstances were different here. On a pitch that was not a minefield but uncertain because of the variable bounce, Ponting showed his keenness to attack.         
	Dangerman Sehwag survived an easy chance on five when Brad Haddin lunged in front of first slip and snatched away a straightforward chance for Matthew Hayden. The openers joy was shortlived, though.         
	Old habits die hard and the profligacy of the Indians returned to haunt them. The next ball Sehwag faced, he attempted to flick Stuart Clark, but ended up giving a low catch to Hayden for the second time in this Test.         
	Worse was to follow. Rahul Dravid tried to clip a straight ball from Brett Lee through the leg side a bit too early, and a brilliant reflex action from an airborne Ponting at short mid-wicket had the visitors celebrating again. At 24 for two, the Indians were looking down the barrel.         
	Sachin then started the rescue act with Gambhir. Standing serene at the crease, Sachin judged the length of each ball unerringly and played it on its merit. A typical demonstration of his ensuring skill and indomitable will. It went off well till the moment of madness against White arrived.         
	Laxman also rose to the occasion perfectly. He seemed determined to make up for the first-innings duck. Without missing out on the grace associated with his batting, he showed the self-belief and the willingness to control adversity.         
	Sourav didnt disappoint either. He looked dependable in both the innings. Chants of dada dada filled the air as he walked back to the pavilion for the last time here. After all, this is where he got his highest Test score of 239 against Pakistan.         
	For the Indian captain, the match wasnt memorable. As far as final Tests on home grounds go, Kumbles experience must rank among the worst.         
	He went wicketless in his 51 overs, suffered a shoulder injury and dropped two catches. If that was not enough, he got hit on the left hand while attempting a caught and bowled chance off the first ball on the final day. He was back to the dressing room at the end of the over.

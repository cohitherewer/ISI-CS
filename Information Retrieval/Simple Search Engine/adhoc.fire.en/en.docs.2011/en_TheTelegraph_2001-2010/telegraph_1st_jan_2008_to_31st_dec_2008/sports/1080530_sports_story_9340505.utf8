	New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar shot down Lalit Modis grand plans to have the Indian Premier League (IPL) twice a year and said the crammed International Cricket Council (ICC) calendar leaves no such scope.         
	Days after Modi, the IPL chairman and commissioner, said that from 2011 onwards, he would like to see the IPL twice a year  one starting in May and the other in September  Pawar categorically dismissed such a possibility.         
	We have just got one window from the ICC per year. The calendar is ready for next seven years, so there is no scope, Pawar told in a television interview.         
	Earlier, in a television interview, Modi had spelled out his future plans for the Twenty20 extravaganza and said, I think the IPL, we will like to keep it as two seasons.         
	A single season for the first three years, we would like to move it to two seasons and we have another season in September. (PTI)

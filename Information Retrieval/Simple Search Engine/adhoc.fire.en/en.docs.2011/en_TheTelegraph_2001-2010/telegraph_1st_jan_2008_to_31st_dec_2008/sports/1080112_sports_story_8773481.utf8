                                                   NZ players slam Aussies

           
	Wellington: Former New Zealand players have lambasted the Australians for having double standards on sledging and said they should be ashamed of their gutless and churlish charge of racial abuse against Harbhajan Singh. 
    
	Launching a scathing attack on their trans-Tasmanian neighbours, the players  John Morrison, Dipak Patel and Simon Doull  said the Australians were themselves so foul-mouthed that they had no moral right to complain about others. 
    
	Morrison, who played for New Zealand in the 1970s and 80s, said, theyve basically run off to tell the teacher on Harbhajan. 
    
	If the Aussies have any conscience at all, surely theyd be ashamed over this because its just gutless, its churlish, its childish  the sort of thing youd see in a playground, he was quoted as saying in a New Zealand daily. A lot of good cricket people around the world will not like whats happened here, he added. 
    
	Former captain Stephen Fleming said the matter, which looked a bit schoolboyish initially, became a mess because of lack of independent evidence. 
    
	The Harbhajan aspect is interesting. It sounds like there is a case there to be answered, its the players word against another  without the match officials its very messy, Fleming was quoted as saying by New Zealand Players Association. 
    
	It does look a little bit schoolboyish, though the racial issue does cause concern for a lot of players. Theres been a big push to stamp it out, he added. 
    
	Patel, meanwhile, felt the Aussies have dished far worse of their mental disintegration to act so sensitive on Harbhajan. 
    
	Im not saying that he (Harbhajan) is not guilty but theres been a lot worse said by Australians in the past to other opposition, Patel said. 
    
	What happens on the park should stay on the park. Ive been called a lot worse than a monkey, to be honest with you, and its just something that you accept and its left on the field, Patel opined. 
    
	Doull, a former fast bowler, felt the case against Harbhajan hardly stands in the absence of any independent evidence. From my point of view the Match Referee is there to do a job. If the umpires or the Match Referee havent seen it or heard it, theres no case at all to answer, he said. (PTI)

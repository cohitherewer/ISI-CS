	Sydney: Australian teenager Stephanie Rice broke her second world record in three days at the national Olympic trials on Tuesday.         
	The 19-year-old added the 200 metres individual medley record to the 400 mark she claimed on Saturday when she stopped the clock at two minutes 08.92 seconds.         
	Her time slashed 0.80 off the previous record of 2:09.72, set by Chinas Wu Yanyan at Shanghai in 1997, which was the second oldest long course (50-metre pool) world record still standing.         
	I actually didnt know who held the world record, Rice told reporters.         
	I knew it was someone from China but I didnt know who it was, because obviously it happened so long ago.         
	Rice, who snatched the 400 record from American Katie Hoff on the weekend, became the first woman since East Germanys Petra Schneider in 1980 to hold both individual medal records at the same time.         
	The Queenslander is the newest member of a powerful Australian swim team expected to challenge for gold medals in Beijing. Rice burst on to the international swimming scene at the 2006 Commonwealth Games when she won the 200-400 medley double as a 17-year-old.         
	She finished third in both events at last years world championships but it was her feats over the past three days that have suddenly made her the favourite to win Olympic gold.

                                                   No room for Shield

	New Delhi: Come 2008, the revised calendar of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for the year is so crammed with other tournaments that the Indian Football Association (IFA) might not get a chance to host the prestigious IFA Shield for the 2007-08 season. 
    
	Though the IFA secretary, Utpal Ganguly is still hopeful of holding the meet sometime in March or April, the calendar has clearly left no room to stage the 113th edition of the historic tournament. This could turn out to be a huge financial loss for the Bengal body as the IFA Shield has the annual sponsorship backing of Rs. 75 lakhs by the ESPN. In addition, the television channel also foots the bill for the prize money, which is Rs. 15 lakhs. 
    
	Ganguly, when asked by The Telegraph, said: We have plans to hold the IFA Shield sometime in March or April. But a look at the calendar would reveal that several top city teams would be busy elsewhere during that period. 
    
	While the curtain comes down on the I-League on February 23 followed by the Super Cup on February 27, the AIFF plans to kick start the Second Division I-League in March and continue it till April. 
    
	With Mohammedan Sporting and Chirag United planning to battle it out in the Second Division I-League, the IFA, in case it decides to stage the IFA Shield during this period, will have to do it without these two teams. 
    
	To add to the woe, East Bengal, too, would be forced to skip the city meet as they are scheduled to play the AFC Cup matches in March and April. There is no time beyond April as the Santosh Trophy is fixed for May, 2008 in Jammu and Kashmir. 
    
	A look at the AIFF calendar also makes it clear that the 2008 Calcutta Premier Division League could be a depleted affair as all the national team probables would remain busy with the national duty between February and August. 
    
	THE CALENDAR 
    
	DOMESTIC  I-League amp; Super Cup (January and February), Second Division I-League (March and April), Santosh Trophy (May), Federation Cup 2008-09 (September and October), I-League 2008-09 (September 2008 to April 2009).

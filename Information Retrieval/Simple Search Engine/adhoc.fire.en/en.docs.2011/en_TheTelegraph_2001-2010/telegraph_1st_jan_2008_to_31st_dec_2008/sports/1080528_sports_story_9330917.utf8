The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diana lawyer to Grants defence
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Diana lawyer to Grants defence

	Avram Grant has recruited Anthony Julius, the lawyer who acted for Princess Diana in her divorce from Prince Charles, to settle the terms of his departure from Chelsea.         
	The Israeli was shocked by his dismissal as manager on Saturday and, after refusing to become directly involved in compensation negotiations, has placed the matter in the hands of one of Britains most renowned legal minds.         
	Grant still had two seasons to run on his 3.5 million-a-year contract, but it is understood that Chelsea, who had to pay Jose Mourinho a 12 million severance package last year, are prepared to pay only 12 months compensation.         
	The search for the new manager is underway. Former Chelsea midfielder Didier Deschamps has already been contacted while the likes of Frank Rijkaard, Roberto Mancini and Mark Hughes remain in contention.         
	However, finalising Grants compensation deal may take longer than expected. Sources close to the 53-year-old have indicated that he intends to fight for every penny.         
	As recently as March, Grant said his long-standing friendship with Roman Abramovich would survive even if he was sacked as manager, but that now appears doubtful. Despite being appointed largely on the back of his association with the clubs Russian owner, their relationship became strained as the season unfolded.

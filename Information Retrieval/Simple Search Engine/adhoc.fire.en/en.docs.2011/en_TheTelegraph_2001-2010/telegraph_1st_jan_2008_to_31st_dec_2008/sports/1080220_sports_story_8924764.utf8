                                                   Diwakar Ram rewarded for good show Down Under
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Diwakar Ram, who scored four goals during the recent tour of Australia, has been rewarded with a berth in the Indian hockey squad for the Olympic qualifiers.         
	The six-nation qualifiers will be played in Santiago from March 1 to 9. Britain, Chile, Mexico, Austria and Russia are the other teams in the fray. Only the winners will qualify for Beijing.         
	Striker Ajeethesh Rai, who performed well in the PHL, also finds a place in the team which was announced by the IHF on Tuesday.         
	Coach Joaquim Carvalho said: This is a balanced side, capable of beating any team in the world. Everyone in the team is a proven customer. I am sure they will not disappoint the fans.         
	Britain, Carvalho feels, would be the team to beat. But we will not take the other teams lightly. Every team has the ability to create an upset.         
	In Australia, India beat Australian Institute of Sports 6-1 in their tour opener but lost by a 2-3 to Western Australia. They then beat China 3-1 and 4-1 and Western Australia 3-1 and 3-1.

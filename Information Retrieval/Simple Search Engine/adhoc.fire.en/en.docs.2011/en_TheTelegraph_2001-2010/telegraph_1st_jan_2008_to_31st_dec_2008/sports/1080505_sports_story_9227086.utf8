The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev ends tied 6th 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Jeev ends tied 6th 
                      
	Nagoya: A bogey-bogey start dealt a severe blow to Jeev Milkha Singhs title hopes and the Indian signed off with a final round of one-under 69 to finish tied sixth in the Crowns golf tournament here on Sunday.         
	Beginning three shots off the lead, Jeev needed a flying start but dropping two shots over the first two holes pushed him on the back-foot and his four-day total of six-under 274 was just enough for a tied sixth finish.         
	Tomohiro Kondo edged out Hiroyuki Fujita in the playoff after the duo was levelled at nine-under 271.         
	Though Jeev did not have the ideal start, the seasoned Indian picked up birdies on the fifth, eighth, 10th and 12th holes to go two-under but two bogeys and a birdie in between saw him eventually settle for 69.         
	In Valdosta, meanwhile, Arjun Atwal continued to be upwardly mobile in the South Georgia Classic golf tournament, turning in a three-under 69 in the penultimate round to leap to the tied 27th spot in the $ 625,000 Nationwide Tour event here.         
	The Orlando-based golfer, who barely made the cut at tied 55th on Saturday, has a three-day total of two-under 214.         
	At the top, Canadian Bryan Decorso shot a blemish free 68 to take his total to 11-under 205 and hold on to his overnight lead, which was cut to just one stroke by Englishman Greg Owen.         
	Owen fired a flawless seven-under 65 in the penultimate round to grab the sole second spot.           (PTI)

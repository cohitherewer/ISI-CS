            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: The Vijay Singh-trained horse Afforce looks set to begin his seasons campaign on a winning note. Last winter, the Diffident-Thanksgiving colt had reeled off five wins from six starts. Although tightly placed at the weights against Mustang Royal and Aleksie, the four-year-old is bound to show more improvement compared to the older horses. Afforce is sure to start as a favourite and win in the hands of jockey C. Alford.

                                                   Kallis does a Sachin
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Jacques Kallis joined the likes of Adam Gilchrist and Sachin Tendulkar by deciding to walk without waiting for the umpires decision at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Wednesday. For someone who has always maintained that it was the umpires job to give batsmen out, it came as a surprise.         
	Asad Rauf was unmoved even as Harbhajan Singhs flighted delivery ricocheted off the inside edge onto Kalliss pads before landing in Wasim Jaffers hands at short leg.         
	The off-spinner had no doubt that Kallis did the right thing. Obviously it was a big nick and so he had to walk Otherwise it would have been difficult to get him out, Harbhajan said.

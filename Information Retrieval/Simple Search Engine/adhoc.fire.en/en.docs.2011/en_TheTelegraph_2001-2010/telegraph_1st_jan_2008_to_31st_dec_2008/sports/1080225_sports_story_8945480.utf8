The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeff Crowe summons Ishant only
                                                     Jeff Crowe summons Ishant only
          
	Sydney/Dubai: Ishant Sharma has been summoned by Match Referee Jeff Crowe for a disciplinary hearing on Monday morning after a face-off with Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds.         
	Ishant had a heated exchange with Symonds and pointed fingers towards the pavilion after dismissing the Australian allrounder in their tri-series match on Sunday.         
	Ishant has been charged under Clause 1.6 of the ICC Code of Conduct and if found guilty could be reprimanded or fined up to 50 per cent of his match fee, an ICC spokesman said.         
	The hearing will be held at the team hotel.         
	Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni preferred to be tight-lipped on the heated exchange of words between Ishant and Symonds.         
	Symonds (59), who was fired up in the final overs smashing sixes, was foxed by Ishants slower delivery and clean bowled. But Symonds did not leave the ground before the verbal duel with the umpires asking the visiting teams player to show restraint.         
	Umpire Daryl Harper was seen having a word with Dhoni.         
	So far nothing has happened. We havent been called by the Match Referee. So I think there is no issue to it, said Dhoni after India lost by 18 runs.         
	But Australian skipper Ricky Ponting claimed that Sharma started it and Symonds behaved in retaliation.         
	These are minor issues and happen on the field all the time. But Symonds said so in response and he did not provoke it, Ponting said.         
	May be, there is something in the Sydney water, he added, relating it to the racial slur charge against Harbhajan Singh which came about at the same venue during the Test series.         
	There was another official intervention when the Australian team management complained about the gloves Dhoni was wearing. The hosts alleged that the gloves with which he caught Adam Gilchrist down the leg side had a bigger cusp, probably to help him get a bigger span to catch a chance.

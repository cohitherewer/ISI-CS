	London: Uefa Cup favourites Bayern Munich will again have to produce the goods next week after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Zenit St Petersburg in the home leg of their semi-final on Thursday.         
	Bayern will need to score at least once in St Petersburg after an own goal on the hour from Lucio cancelled out Franck Riberys first-half opener. There is all to play for in Florence next Thursday as well after Rangers and Fiorentina battled out a 0-0 draw at Ibrox.         
	Bayern, who won the German Cup on Saturday, missed a hatful of chances at home against Getafe in the first leg of their quarter final and only went through after some last-gasp heroics in the return.         
	Their home tie with Russian champions Zenit followed a similar pattern. The hosts, who hope to clinch their 21st German championship at the weekend, failed to build on Riberys 18th-minute goal  a rebound after the Frenchmans penalty had been saved.         
	Without suspended Italian striker Luca Toni Bayern lacked a cutting edge and were made to pay when Victor Fayzulins driven cross from the left struck Lucio on the head and ricocheted past keeper Oliver Kahn from six metres out.         
	Zenits good European form has contrasted with a mediocre start to their defence of their Russian crown but they will miss the influential Andrei Arshavin for the return next Thursday through suspension.         
	The Russia captain was one of three Zenit players to be booked with Fernando Ricksen and Radek Sirl also missing the second leg. Rangerss clash with Fiorentina won few plaudits for entertainment value in a cagey first leg.         
	The Scottish side, hit by injury and suspension, kept up their record of not conceding at home since they parachuted into the competition from the Champions League but they rarely troubled Fiorentinas well-organised defence.         
	Meanwhile, Bayern forward Miroslav Klose could miss the second leg of the semi-final because of a broken nose. Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld on Friday called the Germany forwards chances of playing next Thursday very questionable and said he faces an operation.         
	Klose has been ruled out of Sundays Bundesliga contest against VfB Stuttgart.           (AGENCIES)

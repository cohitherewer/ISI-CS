The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Safina storms into 1st Grand Slam final
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Safina storms into 1st Grand Slam final
  - Ivanovic clinches see-saw semi-final against Jankovic
                      
	Paris: Dinara Safina spared herself yet another drama to book her first Grand Slam final place when she saw off fellow-Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-3, 6-2 in the French Open semi-final on Thursday.         
	The younger sister of two-time Grand Slam winner Marat Safin will meet Ana Ivanovic, who won a see-saw semi-final against fellow Serb Jelena Jankovic 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.         
	Ivanovic swept the final three games for a victory that ensures shell be ranked No. 1 for the first time next week, replacing Maria Sharapova.         
	Safinas berth in a major final is her first. Her brother Marat Safin is a former No. 1 player who won the 2000 US Open and 2005 Australian Open.         
	Im still here today, said Safina, who had recovered from match point in the two previous rounds against compatriots Maria Sharapova and Elena Dementieva. I am really happy because I played well today. I feel its amazing. I was taking it just day by day and the less you expect, the more you get.         
	Im doing it for him, myself and Im doing it for the family, she added, referring to her brother, who has never reached the final at Roland Garros.         
	Safina said she would be ready to dig deep in the final but she was not stretched by Kuznetsova on Thursday. She held her nerve and it was the fourth seed who showed signs of cracking, sending a ball into the crowd in frustration.         
	It was a horrible match. I could not serve, I could not play my forehand, it was one of my worst matches against her, said Kuznetsova, who had won her last two matches on clay against Safina, including a 7-6, 6-0 quarter final win at Roland Garros two years ago. She played every ball, she was more consistent.         
	The 22-year-old Safina, who applied a treatment cream on a bruised left knee before the start of the game, saved a break point in the first game before stealing her opponents serve with a cross court backhand winner.         
	A tense Kuznetsova stayed in the contest courtesy of Safinas unforced errors but she dropped serve for the third time in the eighth game.         
	Safina claimed the opening set when the world No. 4 sent a forehand wide after 39 minutes. She went on to snatch Kuznetsovas serve to take the early lead in the second set, only for her to serve a couple of double faults that helped the fourth seed catch up.         
	Safina broke in the fifth game when Kuznetsova netted a forehand and staved off two break points to open a 4-2 lead. She kept her form as Kuznetsova dropped serve again.         
	A steaming Safina did not let the opportunity slip from her grasp and sealed the win after one hour and 27 minutes when Kuznetsova sent a forehand wide.         
	Ivanovic, the second seed and runner-up last year, led by a set and 3-1 only for Jankovic to level and go ahead 3-1 in the decider herself, before Ivanovic recovered again.         
	It was a very tough match  there were lots of ups and downs, a relieved Ivanovic said. I was just so happy to stay strong in the end and win the match, but it was a very tough one.         
	(From 3-1 up in the second set), I think she just started playing really good tennis. Maybe I started to be a bit too passive but shes a very good player and if you give her chances, she is going to take them.         
	Ivanovic said she expected a difficult final against Safina. She has had a great run and its going to be a very tough matchd. (AGENCIES)

	Kanpur: The Indian and South African teams arrived in Kanpur on Tuesday for the third and final Test beginning on Friday at the Green Park Stadium. Both the teams were accorded a traditional welcome at a city hotel. The Indian players were welcomed by the customary tilak.         
	India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was seen cracking jokes with his South African counterparts as they entered the hotel.         
	Local heroes Mohammed Kaif, who made it to the squad as a replacement for the injured Sachin Tendulkar, and leg-spinner Piyush Chawla also seemed in high spirits.         
	Pacer Ishant Sharma and off-spinner Ramesh Powar had arrived ahead of their teammates from New Delhi.         
	The Team India Test captain, still recovering from a groin injury that may force him out of the third Test against South Africa had skipped the teams practice session in Ahmedabad on Monday. His spinning partner Harbhajan Singh, nursing a stomach bug, also did likewise.         
	In the gruelling nets on Monday evening, ODI skipper and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni wielded the willow but stayed away from fielding practice.         
	Munaf Patel, who has replaced the out of form pacer R.P. Singh, joined the team and sweated it out at the nets.           (PTI)

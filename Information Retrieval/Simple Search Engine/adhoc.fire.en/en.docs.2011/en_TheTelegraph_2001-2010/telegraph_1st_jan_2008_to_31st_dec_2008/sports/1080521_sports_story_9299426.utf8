The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne doesnt excite Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                             Warne doesnt excite Ponting
  - Cricket Australia plays down reports of retired leg-spinners return             Ricky Ponting                           
	Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) has played down reports that retired leg-spinner Shane Warne could return to international cricket for next years Ashes tour of England.         
	The former leading Test wicket-taker, who quit the international arena after Australias 5-0 victory over England in early 2007, was quoted in local media as saying he would consider returning for the next Ashes series.         
	If Australia really needed me and there was no one else around, and Ricky (Ponting) thought I could do the job, you would weigh up the options, Warne was quoted as saying in Tuesdays Herald Sun.         
	If Stuey (Stuart) MacGill fell over and broke his leg, and there were no other spinners around, and Ricky came out and said, Mate, can you please help us out for this one-off tour? We need you, that is something I would weigh up.         
	CA chief executive James Sutherland, however, distanced his organisation from Warnes comments.         
	Ive been in cricket long enough not to be surprised of any headlines that Warnie grabs, a smiling Sutherland told reporters.         
	The simple answer to that is that Shane is retired from international cricket and has been for 15 months or so.         
	I acknowledge there has been speculation in the newspapers...but the reality is that Shane is retired and not available for selection. It is up to him if he wants to make himself available and that is something only he can decide. I havent spoken to him.         
	Sutherland said if Warne made himself available, then it would be up to the selectors to decide on the best team.         
	Im not a selector, he added. They make decisions in the best interests of Australia cricket. They choose the best Australian cricket team based on those players that are available at the time.         
	Its not for me to be determining what the Australian cricket team needs.         
	Warne, who took 708 Test wickets, has since retired from first-class cricket and is only playing in a domestic Twenty20 competition in India.         
	If I wanted to keep playing I dont think there would be an issue with me being the number one spinner and performing, he said.         
	I would still love to be playing international cricket, and miss it because I devoted 20 years to first-class cricket.         
	It is a big part of my life. If you could just turn up and play test cricket, that would be cool.         
	I would definitely consider that.         
	Meanwhile, Aussie skipper Ponting also did not take the suggestion seriously and said he did not see it happening.         
	He (Warne) has never mentioned that to me about coming back for the Ashes and I dont think that will happen, Ponting was quoted saying in The Australian.           (AGENCIES)

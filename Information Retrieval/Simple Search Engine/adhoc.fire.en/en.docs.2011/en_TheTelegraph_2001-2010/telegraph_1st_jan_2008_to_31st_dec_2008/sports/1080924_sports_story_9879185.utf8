	Calcutta: Mumbai FC will not be mere pushovers and will throw down the gauntlet against the heavyweights in the I-League, coach David Booth said after his teams practice match against the SAI East team on Tuesday.         
	The Mumbai outfit, who start their I-League campaign against city giants Mohun Bagan on Saturday, beat the SAI East team 4-1 in the practice match. Ghanaian Felix Abue scored thrice while his countryman Abel Hammond rounded off the tally. The other foreigner for the new entrants in the I-League is also from Ghana  defender James Desirama.         
	Felixs profile is an attractive one. He played for Ghana and was also part of the squad who lost to Brazil in the quarter finals of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The then Brazil squad had stalwarts like Bebeto and Ronaldo in their ranks.         
	Felix, who played for Mahindra United in 2004, has also played for Greek side Olympiacos for a year.         
	I am happy with the performance of the boys today (Tuesday). It was not about the goals or the win I wanted to see the movements The co-ordination between them, the teams British coach said.         
	The Mumbai FC was formed only about 16 months back and has former Bengal players like Kalyan Chaubey, Subhas Chakraborty and Amit Singha Roy in their ranks.         
	Asked if he was satisfied with the team he has at his disposal, he quipped: We are a very new side. Most of the frontline players have already signed for big clubs. But we will try our best with the resources we have.         
	We might be new in the league, but that does not mean well be easy opponents. We have a good mix of talented youth players and experienced pros and its a challenge for all of them. Not merely survival but winning as many matches as we can would be on our mind, Booth said.         
	Booth decided to play the opening half of the match with his first team. Four goals came during the period for the visitors with all being scored by the foreign recruits.         
	The team decided to come early to the city due to lack of proper training facilities in Mumbai, Chaubey the sides goalkeeper said.         
	As you know the grounds in Mumbai are completely destroyed by heavy rains. We were not getting proper training. So we decided to come to Calcutta early, Chaubey added.

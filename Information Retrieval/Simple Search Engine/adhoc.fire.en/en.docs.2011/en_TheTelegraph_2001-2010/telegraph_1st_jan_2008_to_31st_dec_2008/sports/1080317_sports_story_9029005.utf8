The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My best race so far: Hamilton
                                                   My best race so far: Hamilton
                      
	Melbourne: Lewis Hamilton erased any doubts that he was a one-season wonder with a brilliant performance to win Sundays season-opening Australian Grand Prix.         
	The 23-year-old Briton, in the fifth Grand Prix win of his career, demonstrated a maturity beyond his years to survive a chaotic race where only seven cars made it to the chequered flag.         
	Hamilton started the race from pole position and opened up a commanding lead in his McLaren only to see his advantage eaten away by a series of accidents that forced officials to bring out the safety car on three occasions.         
	The Briton won four races in 2007 but said his victory in Australia was his best yet. This win perhaps feels better than any because I feel Ive improved in many areas, he said.         
	Coming into my second season, I set myself some targets and put myself under more pressure.         
	I wouldnt say its the perfect win because there are a lot of areas I can improve on but I think in terms of managing my tyres, controlling my pace and confidence and being comfortable in the car, its the best race Ive had so far.         
	Hamilton said Sundays win was made all the sweeter because his good friend, Germanys Nico Rosberg, finished third in a Williams to claim his first career podium.         
	The pair were teammates when they started their careers by driving go-karts and Hamilton said sharing the podium with him was the fulfilment of a teenage fantasy.         
	We always said one day we wanted to be in Formula One, winning races and being on the podium together, the Englishman said. Its a childhood dream for both of us and it feels really cool.         
	Rosberg, meanwhile, ended two years of frustration when he climbed onto the podium for the first time.         
	Rosberg, whose father Keke won the world championship in 1982, finished fourth at last years Brazilian GP but said making the podium was the highlight of his career.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | When Holyfield came looking for Vijender 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       When Holyfield came looking for Vijender 
                  Vijender Kumar                     
	Bhiwani: Beijing gave Vijender Kumar the most cherished moments of his fledgling career but the one thing the Olympic bronze medallist missed out there was a chance to meet American boxing legend Evander Holyfield, who came looking for him after his semi-final bout.         
	Holyfield came looking for me after my semi-final loss (to Cuban Emilio Correa Bayeaux) but I had left the arena by then, said Vijender, Indias first Olympic medallist in boxing.         
	Later I was told that he praised my performance, which was very nice of him and a great honour for me, the middle weight pugilist added.         
	A former world heavyweight champion, Holyfield, who was also seen at bantam weight boxer Akhil Kumars quarter final bout against Moldovan Veaceslav Gojan, is now a recruiter for professional boxing in the USA.         
	Vijender, however, is not keen on turning professional.         
	I did give it a thought some time back but I am not interested anymore. I am focused on amateur boxing and I have no plans to turn pro, he said.         
	The 22-year-old said he would cut down on his appearances in the national championships to be in shape for international events.         
	Since I have become a DSP with the Haryana government, I cant participate in the nationals this year but even otherwise, I would not be seen very often in the national events, he revealed.         
	The dapper six-footer has been flooded with modelling offers after his Olympic success and is already a youth icon for a leading insurance company.         
	But I am tired of telling people that my first love is boxing. I am a boxer first but unfortunately my modelling assignments have invited criticism from some quarters, which I think is baseless, he said.         
	Just days after becoming a national hero with his Olympic medal, Vijender had landed in a soup for posing with a cigarette during a magazine photo-shoot.         
	And wary of inviting similar trouble, he refused to pose with a hookah at his home in Kaluwas village here. (PTI)

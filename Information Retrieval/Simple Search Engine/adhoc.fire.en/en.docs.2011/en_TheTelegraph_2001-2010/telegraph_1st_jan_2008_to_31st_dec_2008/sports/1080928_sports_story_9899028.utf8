The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal stunned at home
                                                                                                                                                                                             Arsenal stunned at home

	London: Arsenal were upset 2-1 by Premier League newcomers Hull in the biggest surprise of the season so far  a costly defeat with title rivals Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool all winning 2-0 on Saturday.         
	Daniel Cousin headed in a 66th-minute winner to clinch a famous victory for 104-year-old Hull in their first campaign in the top flight.         
	Arsenal are two points behind early pace-setters Chelsea and Liverpool, but just one point ahead of Hull.         
	Fernando Torres ended his six-game Liverpool goal drought in the victory over cross-town rivals Everton, and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney scored for the first time since April against Bolton.         
	Jose Bosingwa and Nicolas Anelka gave Chelsea a 2-0 win at Stoke, while Aston Villa went third, beating Sunderland 2-1.         
	Newcastle slumped to their fifth loss in a row with Blackburn edging the ailing club 2-1. Gianfranco Zola won his second league match as West Ham manager 2-0 at Fulham and West Bromwich Albion beat Middlesbrough 1-0.         
	The Gunners, who led the league Saturday morning, scrambled for an equaliser with Hull goalkeeper Boaz Myhill turning over Fabregas, Kole Toure striking wide and Robin van Persie driving over in the final minutes.         
	In the 208th Liverpool derby, Xabi Alonso found Robbie Keane on the left flank with a deep pass just before the hour. The Ireland striker worked the ball to the by-line before lofting back into the penalty area for Torres to volley home.         
	Keane was also the architect of the second goal in the 62nd, slotting through to Dirk Kuyt. The Netherlands winger was tackled by Phil Jagielka before he could shoot, but the loose ball fell for Torres to fire past Tim Howard.         
	Everton midfielder Tim Cahill was sent off in the 80th for a late challenge on Alonso  the eighth red card in the last eight Liverpool-Everton encounters.         
	Bosingwa put Chelsea ahead in the 36th with his first goal since moving from FC Porto in the off-season.         
	Bosingwa set up Anelkas 76th-minute goal when Leon Cort failed to clear his cross.         
	Cristiano Ronaldo grabbed a contested opener from the penalty spot in the 60th, with referee Rob Styles penalising Jlloyd Samuel for sliding into Ronaldo, despite appearing to get the ball.         
	But Rooney came off the bench to put the result beyond doubt in the 77th, completing an exchange of passes with Ronaldo by curling a shot past Bolton keeper Jaaskelainen.

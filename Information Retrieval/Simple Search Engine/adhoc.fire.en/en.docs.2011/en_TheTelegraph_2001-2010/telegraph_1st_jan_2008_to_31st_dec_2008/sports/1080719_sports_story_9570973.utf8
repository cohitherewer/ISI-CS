The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib left out of training camp
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shoaib left out of training camp
                      
	Karachi: Maverick pacer Shoaib Akhtar was on Friday left out of the training camp for a Twenty20 tournament in Toronto after he refused to pay the seven million rupees for disciplinary violations.         
	The camp will be held from Monday at the military base of Kakul and Shoaib was not named in a shortlist of 24 players for the camp.         
	The chairman of the national selection committee Salahuddin Ahmed, however, said it was not the end of the road for Shoaib.         
	It was a dramatic volte face from the board which just few days ago included Shoaib in the Champions Trophy preliminary squad.         
	We will call him for the camp once the board gives us the clearance as we have no problems with him and want to see him back in action, Salahuddin Ahmed said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger, Novak move ahead
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Roger, Novak move ahead
                      
	Hamburg: Defending champion Roger Federer cruised into the semi-finals of the Hamburg Masters, beating Fernando Verdasco of Spain 6-3, 6-3 on Friday.         
	Novak Djokovic also made the last four, beating Albert Montanes 6-2, 6-3.         
	The top-ranked Federer, seeking his fifth title in Hamburg, broke Verdascos serve once in the first set.         
	 Verdasco, who lost in the first round to Federer in Hamburg three years ago in their only previous encounter, had his right foot taped after taking a 3-2 lead in the second set and didnt win another game.         
	I felt a sharp pain in my ankle in the fourth game, just when I was making him suffer, Verdasco said.         
	Federer said it was a pity Verdasco hurt his foot, although he didnt think it mattered much in the end.         
	But it was a tough match. He has a perfect game to upset anyone on any surface, Federer said. He was aggressive with his backhand and he surprised me.         
	It took me a little time to adjust little to a lefty.         
	Federer has won only one title this year, at a relatively small clay-court tournament last month in Estoril, Portugal.         
	He lost his sixth match of 2008 in the Rome Masters quarter finals last week, to Radek Stepanek, but has eased through his first three matches in Hamburg without dropping a set.         
	The tournament is a major warm-up for the French Open later this month, the only Grand Slam title that Federer has yet to win.         
	Djokovic won the last four games of the first set and the last three of the second to breeze into the semifinals.         
	That was the idea, trying to finish as fast as possible, Djokovic said.         
	He is seeking back-to-back titles after winning in Rome last week and also captured the first Grand Slam of the year, the Australian Open.         
	Ive gained mental experience and physical strength, I feel at the top, Djokovic said.           (AP)

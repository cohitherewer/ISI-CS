The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Miandad is DG of Pak cricket
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Miandad is DG of Pak cricket
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: Former Pakistan captain and coach Javed Miandad has been appointed director-general of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).         
	Miandad appeared in 124 Tests and 233 one-day Internationals and is Pakistans leading Test run-getter with 8832 runs. The 51-year-olds third stint as Pakistan coach ended in 2004 after a home series loss to India and he has since had an acrimonious relationship with the PCB.         
	The post of director-general in cricket is unheard of and obviously the PCB has created a post for him. Apparently hed been the PCBs first choice to succeed Geoff Lawson as coach and the job went to veteran Intikhab Alam only after he declined.         
	Miandad will be looking after all cricket-related matters in the board, PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf said on Wednesday.         
	Miandad said his immediate priority was to improve the domestic cricket structure in the country, as well as increasing professionalism in Pakistan cricket. I want to have a system of checks and balances for all cricket related matters, he said.         
	Miandad has always been close to the Pakistan Peoples Party which is currently in power.         
	Miandad is the fourth former Test player to be brought into key positions on the board by chairman Ejaz Butt, a former Test player himself.         
	Since last month Butt has appointed Saleem Altaf as chief operating officer, Wasim Bari as director of human resources and Aamer Sohail as director of the cricket academy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev is now 55th
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev is now 55th
                      
	New Delhi: The fourth place finish in the Indian Open, his best show here, pushed Jeev Milkha Singh three places up to 55 as the Indian inched towards a top 50 re-entry in the latest world golf rankings issued on Monday.         
	Jeev, battling through a stiff neck, posted his best show at the Delhi Golf Course on Sunday which has been less-than-kind to him in the past.         
	Though Jeevs 12-under aggregate was still four shots adrift of what eventual winner Liang Weng-Chong totalled, it was enough to see him jump from his previous weeks 58th position.         
	The $49,300 he won also helped Jeev consolidate his second place on the Asian Tour Order of Merit, adding to his seasons collection which now stands at $589,994.         
	Compatriot Jyoti Randhawa, meanwhile, continued his freefall in the ranking ladder and his tied 57th place finish in the Indian Open, which he had won thrice in the past, saw him slip 11 rungs to 126.         
	US-based Arjun Atwal is 230th in the chart, while Indian Masters winner S.S.P. Chowrasia, who failed to make the cut this weekend, is placed 286th.

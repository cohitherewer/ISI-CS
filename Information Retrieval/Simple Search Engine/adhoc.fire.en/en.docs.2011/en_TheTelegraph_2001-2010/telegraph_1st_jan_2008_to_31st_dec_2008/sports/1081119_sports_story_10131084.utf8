The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | When Punter got it wrong
                                                                                                                                                                                           When Punter got it wrong
                      
	Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting had considered Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men better suited to Twenty20 cricket rather than Tests after their World Cup triumph in South Africa. This, of course, was before Australias 0-2 Test loss in India.         
	Ponting, talking about the success of the Indian team in the Twenty20 World Cup, wrote in his book Captains Diary 2008 that Dhoni was a classic example of a player who could damage the opposition in the shortest version which offers little scope for a batsman to showcase his technique.         
	Teams that are outclassed in five-day matches and even 50-over games are much more competitive than Twenty20. India offer a good example of this. The shorter the format of the game the more dangerous they become, Ponting said.         
	Some of their batsmen, Yuvraj Singh and M.S. Dhoni, are classic examples (and) can hurt you more in shorter games because there is less opportunity to find ways of picking apart their technique, he said, adding, Form in Twenty20 really doesnt count for all that much.         
	Ponting dismissed Indias successful journey to the T20 world title attributing it more to luck than actual skill.         
	I am not as cynical about the game as I once was, but some negatives still nag at me. There is so much luck involved in this shortened form of the game; its not always going to be the best team that wins.         
	I guess thats true of all sport but it seems to be accentuated here... Little wonder, then, that the tournament has been unpredictable, with many locals stunned that previously unbeaten South Africa was eliminated so comfortably by India, he said.         
	Ponting also wondered why Dhoni had complained about him over sledging during the one-dayer in Kochi last year.         
	After the game, at the captains media conference, M.S. Dhoni revealed that he had complained to the umpires about what he called harsh language that I and some other Australian players had used on the field.         
	I really dont know where he was coming from. The umpires didnt have a problem, match referee Chris Broad didnt have a problem and I wonder whether Dhoni was trying to somehow square the ledger after the controversy that engulfed Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh in Kochi.         
	Ponting said Dhonis behaviour was rather strange as Broad had lauded his teams approach towards the game.         
	I actually sat on the plane right behind Chris Broad, and he made a point of turning around and congratulating me for the way our team approached the game. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | MALCOLM SPEED PROFILE
                                                                                                                                                                                                       MALCOLM SPEED PROFILE
                  Malcolm Speed                     
	 Full name: Malcolm Walter Speed         
	 Date of Birth: September 14, 1948         
	 Place of Birth: Melbourne         
	 Age: 59 years 224 days               
	 Malcolm Speed, who always tended to take an anti-India stance, became the ICC chief executive in 2001 after a four-year spell as chairman of the Australian Cricket Board (now Cricket Australia). He was a barrister in London before joining sports administration. From 1980 to 1997 he held senior positions in Australian basketball and from 1993 to 1997, Speed was chairman of the Victorian Council for Fitness and Health.         
	 Under him, the ICC rebranded itself although the overtly corporate nature of the 2003 World Cup and the following Champions Trophy has come in for extensive criticism. Speeds ability to turn a blind eye has occasionally come back to bite him. During his time in charge of the ACB, it was revealed that he had fined Shane Warne and Mark Waugh for their dalliances with bookmakers a full four years before this was made public, and it wasnt until he was foolishly snubbed by the Zimbabwe Cricket Board during a trip to Harare in 2004 that he softened his attitude towards Englands reluctant tourists.         
	 A man with a long-standing interest in the implications of gambling in sport, in April 2005 he called for the criminalisation of cheating in sport. He formed a particularly effective partnership with Ehsan Mani during his three-year stint as president, including cutting the ICCs 96-year ties with Lords.         
	 Speeds standing was hardly enhanced by his initial stubborn refusal to admit to the failings of the 2007 World Cup, and then when he was no longer able to defend the indefensible, his attempts to heap the blame on the local organisers. The ICC certainly made millions of dollars, but the damage to the image of the game has yet to be quantified.

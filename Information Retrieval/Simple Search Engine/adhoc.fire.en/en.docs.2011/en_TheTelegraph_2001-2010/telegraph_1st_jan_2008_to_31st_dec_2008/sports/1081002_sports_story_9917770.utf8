The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Berbatov shines on debut
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Berbatov shines on debut
            MARK OGDEN IN AALBORG                      
	Dimitar Berbatov marked his Champions League debut for Manchester United with two spectacular goals to secure a comfortable victory in Denmark, but the Bulgarians impressive contribution was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee ligament injury suffered by midfielder Paul Scholes.         
	Berbatov, whose double strike will go some way to silencing those who have questioned his ability to adapt to the unique demands that come with performing for United, produced his most eye-catching display since arriving from Tottenham as United coasted to the three points.         
	But while the victory puts Uniteds Group E campaign back on course following the 0-0 draw at home to Villarreal last month, Scholess injury, suffered as a result of landing awkwardly following a Thomas Augustinussen challenge, took the gloss off a comprehensive dismantling of Bruce Riochs team.         
	Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, has discovered on numerous occasions in the past the perils of fielding under-strength teams in the unforgiving environment of the Champions League. Defeats against Maccabi Haifa, Fenerbahce and FC Copenhagen, after relying on his fringe players to deliver a positive result, now appear to have instilled a healthy level of caution into his selection policy.         
	The 0-1 defeat against Copenhagen in the Danish capital two years ago taught Ferguson that even Europes perceived minnows are capable of capitalising on any chinks in Uniteds armour, and he stated quite clearly ahead of this game that he would field his strongest possible starting XI to safeguard against unnecessary difficulties.         
	Barring the surprise decision to hand Brazilian youngster Rafael da Silva a Champions League debut at right-back ahead of the England defender Wes Brown, Fergusons team sheet will have delivered an unequivocal statement of intent when it was pinned on the wall of the Aalborg dressing-room.         
	The noisy Aalborg supporters attempted to make life difficult for United by jeering Cristiano Ronaldos every touch and unfurling a Welcome to Hell banner behind the goal, but they are still some way off recreating the Ali Sami Yen in the Energi Nord Arena. On this evidence, the Danes are probably the least-hostile supporters in the world.         
	It was clear from the moment that Berbatov volleyed wide from close range on six minutes that the biggest threat to United was themselves. The slick inter-passing between Berbatov, Ronaldo and Rooney was razor-sharp and far too quick for the Aalborg defenders, but a combination of wasteful finishing and a fine save by goalkeeper Karim Zaza from Rio Ferdinand prevented United from racing into a decisive lead inside the opening 20 minutes.         
	The loss of Scholes following a 14th-minute tangle with Augustinussen, when the United midfielder jarred his right knee after landing awkwardly, robbed the European champions of their creative orchestrator. But Ryan Giggs is hardly a sub-standard replacement and he needed just six minutes to make his mark.         
	With Giggs 35th birthday approaching next month, Ferguson has admitted that he would be used increasingly as an impact player from the bench this season, but his pass for Rooneys goal underlined his peerless ability to make a telling intervention whenever called upon by his manager.         
	Having received the ball 30 yards from goal, Giggs made use of his space by threading the ball into the penalty area, eliminating three defenders with one movement of his left boot, to leave Rooney with the simple task of beating the exposed Zaza from 12 yards.

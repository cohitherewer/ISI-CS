	Two weeks have flown, but the 2008 Wimbledon mens final is still vivid in our memories and refuses to go away. There is unanimity in proclaiming it as the greatest final ever, but there are divergent views about what the future holds. With Federers slipping crown, mens tennis has stepped into an exciting new era. Can he come back and meet the challenge of Nadal, who seems to be a head in front of him. Also ranging alongside is the 21-year-old Serbian Novak Djokovic, who has now pulled out of Federers slipstream.         
	One thing is for sure that Federer is no longer his old self and his 250-week stint as No. 1 is coming to an end. Times toll is irreplaceable and cannot be topped up by a pit-stop. Federer can surely win more Grand Slam titles by conserving his depleted physical and mental resources and playing in fewer select tournaments.         
	In essence, the very narrow margin in the final resulted due to Federer not being able to call the tune or dominate the match as he did in the classic 2007 final. This year it was Nadal who was pushing Federer to the wall, with some of the most amazing retrieving in the history of the game.         
	Not only that, Nadal, from hopeless positions, produced sharply angled winners with his backhand from deep behind the baseline with a last minute flick of the wrist. It was unbelievable. Federer, who lashed out in frustration with his lethal forehand after he came back from the rain break having lost the first two sets, produced some magnificent tennis to level at 2 sets all.         
	Etched deep in everyones memory is the fearless topspin backhand down the line passing shot Federer hit when Nadal came to the net at match point. Federer, like a true champion, hung on bravely but Nadal kept coming back as he stuck to his task limpet like. In the hushed silence of the centre court, the rasping sound of spin from Nadals racket struggled against the sharp staccato retort from Federers racket.         
	This, interspersed with the rhythmic chanting of Roger, Roger by the adoring crowd was the sound track of the greateast Wimbledon final ever. A few unforced errors instead of the usual winners highlighted the marginal decline in Federers confidence. His dream of a sixth Wimbledon, and being undisputedly the Greatest of All Time, faded with the Wimbledon twilight. It was sad to see Federer slump in his chair after the final. He looked crushed. This was not Federers last hurrah; he will be back next year. With a lighter load of expectation, he could pick up a couple of more Grand Slams.         
	Whatever the ATP rankings may say, the Spaniards and a host of experts contend that Nadals 2008 record makes him the indisputable No. 1 in the world. His victories in the French Open and then on grass at Queens and at Wimbledon are a tribute to his versatility and his think-tank.         
	Nadal has improved his serve, developed a stinging backhand and flattened out his forehand when going for winners.

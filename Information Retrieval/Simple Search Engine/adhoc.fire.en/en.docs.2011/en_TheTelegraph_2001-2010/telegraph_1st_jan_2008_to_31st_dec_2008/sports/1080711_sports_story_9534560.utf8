The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tait among probables
                                                                                                                                                                                           Tait among probables
            A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta: Fast bowler Shaun Tait, who has been battling depression and decided to take a break from cricket in January, has been included in Australias 30-member probables list for the Champions Trophy in Pakistan in September.         
	The 25-year-old, who quit all forms of cricket in January saying he was worn out from the grind and pressure of professional sport, had earlier targeted a return to the game for the beginning of Australias domestic season.         
	Chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said the inclusion of Tait, who trained with the Australian Test squad in May to work on his fitness, was an indication of his progress.         
	Shaun Tait has been included as he continues his extensive rehabilitation program to resume playing cricket, Hilditch said in a Cricket Australia release on Thursday.         
	Shaun had a significant impact in our World Cup victory and at his best is a formidable weapon in one-day cricket.         
	Tasmanian trio Xavier Doherty, Brett Greeves and Tim Paine and Queenslands Ryan Harris have all been included in a senior Australian squad for the first time.         
	The four had all earned their place in the expanded squad after successful domestic one-day performances last season, Hilditch said.         
	Left-arm wrist spinner Beaun Casson, who made his Test debut in the Caribbean after Stuart MacGill announced his retirement, was not included.         
	Beau Casson is unlucky to miss out after a promising start in Test cricket, but needs more exposure in one-day cricket before being considered for Australian selection, said Hilditch.         
	The squad will be trimmed to 15 in August.         
	Australias first game in group A of the tournament is against India in Lahore on September 13, before they meet Pakistan in Rawalpindi on September 17 and the West Indies in Karachi on September 21.         
	In Colombo, Lasith Malinga and allrounder Farvez Mahroof are among the 30 Sri Lankan probables after missing the Asia Cup.         
	AUSTRALIA PROBABLES         
	Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, George Bailey, Doug Bollinger, Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clark, Dan Cullen, Xavier Doherty, Brett Geeves, Ryan Harris, Brad Haddin, Nathan Hauritz, Matthew Hayden, Brad Hodge, James Hopes, David Hussey, Michael Hussey, Phil Jaques, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Brett Lee, Shaun Marsh, Ashley Noffke, Tim Paine, Luke Ronchi, Andrew Symonds, Shaun Tait, Adam Voges, Shane Watson, Cameron White.

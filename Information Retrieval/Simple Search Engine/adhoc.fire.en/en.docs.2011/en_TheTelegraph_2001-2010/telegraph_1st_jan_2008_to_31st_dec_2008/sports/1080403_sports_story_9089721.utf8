	Calcutta: Viktor Laznicka of Czech Republic pipped Krishnan Sasikiran in the tie-breaker to clinch the top spot in the Calcutta Open Grandmasters Chess Tournament at Alekhine Chess Club Wednesday.         
	In a tense final round, both Laznicka and Sasikiran won their respective games and tallied 8.5 points each. But Laznicka had a better Elo average in the tie-breaker to emerge winner and pocket a prize purse of Rs.2 lakh. Runner-up Sasikiran had to be content with the Rs.1,60,000.         
	I did not expect to win the meet, though I had expectation to finish near the top. It was only after I won four rounds and Sasikiran fell behind, the victory seemed realistic, Laznicka said adding that this was his best performance till date.         
	I was a bit edgy against Adly Ahmed. The fact that Adly had beaten me in 20 moves in the world junior last year (Armenia) made me jittery. But then, I was playing well and that gave me confidence. In a Reti opening, both of us had equal chances. But Adly blundered on 21st move, playing Ra7. I won the exchange and the game thereafter, said Laznicka who idolises Vladimir Kramnik.         
	On the top board, Sasikiran faced little resistance from S. Arun Prasad who achieved his 3rd GM norm here. In a Semi-Slav defence, Sasikiran grabbed a pawn on b5 after which Arun Prasads queenside pawns were split. The resulting position was exploited with technical precision by Sasikiran.         
	GM Shukhrat Safin of Uzbekistan outwitted GM Tejas Bakre in the final round to take the third spot and a prize money of Rs.1,20,000. City-based GM Sandipan Chanda drew with Rolando Nolte of Philippines with black in a Sicilian defence to take the fourth place and a cash prize of Rs. 1 lakh.         
	Apart from Arun Prasad and Rolando Nolte, who got GM norms here, B.T. Muralikrishnan, Oliver Barbosa, Arghyadip Das Swapnil Dhopade, M.S. Thejkumar achieved IM norms while Nimmy George achieved her second WIM norm.  FINAL STANDINGS  1. Viktor Laznicka (8.5 points); 2. Krishnan Sasikiran (8.5); 3. Shukhrat Safin (7.5); 4.

                                                                                                                                                                                           I like seeing my decisions vindicated, says Kumble
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL
  -   The other side of Team Indias Test captain         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              
	Colombo: Team Indias Test captain Anil Kumble, 37, is generally very reserved. Recently, however, he made an exception of sorts and spoke to The Telegraph on matters not related to cricket.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Q His exemplary calmness         
	A Thats my nature... Its about the way I am... Ive always been a quiet kind of a guy... I guess its very difficult getting to know what Im thinking...         
	Whether he gets angry         
	I do... Sometimes I get very angry... If I then need to say something, I do... If something has hurt me, hurt my cricket, then Id like to go out and perform in the middle... Id rather express my anger on the field... Im not one to answer back (through words), whatever the issues... Dont see that as necessary. Meditating         
	No.         
	Approach to life         
	I believe in honesty, being sincere... Being disciplined... I like to stay relaxed and thats a mental thing... I like to be clear in the mind about what Im trying to do and if theres a conflict or confusion within, then I try to clear it.         
	On himself         
	(After a pause) Id like to think Im a very normal person, that would be the best description... I realise what whatever I am today is because Im a cricketer.         
	Whether he bottles up his emotions         
	I dont show my emotions... I believe its important to keep emotions in check otherwise you wont be able to perform... That responsibility is there as one represents more than a billion people.         
	If hes tempted by material things         
	Camera equipment is certainly a weakness... I try and pick up the best... Problem is you do get attracted to the good things in life and most of them are expensive... However, I do assess whether something is actually important for me... Ill take a clinical view if its for me, but that wont be the case if its something for a loved one. Usually, the things I buy on an impulse are trousers and shirts or a jacket. Of course, I remember picking up an excellent camera lens during the last Hong Kong Sixes.         
	Whether he dreams         
	I think everybody does, but I dont remember what.         
	Nightmares         
	Dont think I have them... I mean I dont remember what happens when Im asleep... Whether its a sweet dream or a nightmare...         
	Approach to cricket         
	Its very similar to the way I approach everything else... I like to prepare well, try and do everything that I can to be ready for a challenge... I try not to worry... In fact, if one has prepared well, then theres no reason to worry... Confidence comes from preparing thoroughly.         
	Handling pressure         
	I dont think about pressure, of the pressure of leading India... Its only when Im asked questions that the pressure thing comes up. I dont see the captaincy as adding to the pressure any international sportsman faces.         
	Whether hes scared of failure         
	I dont go around thinking I could fail... Yes, negative thoughts do come, but I take them out of the system.         
	Style of captaincy         
	Im not one for big lectures... I do communicate with the team as a whole and, if needed, speak to the players individually... I do things Im convinced about... Have self-belief... When I wasnt the captain, Id express my thoughts within the walls of the dressing room... Now, I often have to do so publicly. So, thats a change... (After a pause) Whatever decisions I take are in the interest of the team... I like seeing my decisions vindicated and Im absolutely open about them.         
	Inspirations outside cricket         
	A lot of people whose paths Ive crossed... Eventually, though, you do things the way you think is right... You adapt the right way...         
	The kind of person who impresses him         
	Somebody who is humble inspite of all the achievements... Is hard working... Somebody who ensures that the talent is sustained over a period of time.... Somebody who is a balanced character... Ive been fortunate to have played with a Sachin Tendulkar throughout my career... One learns... Ive learnt from Rahul (Dravid) too... Its good that our team has prominent guys whove been big achievers.         
	Influence of his parents  Saroja and the late Krishnaswamy         
	Ones parents do influence... Its only later in life that you really get to know your Dad and youd like to sit down and have a chat with him but, unfortunately, I cant do that... When one is young, one tends to take things for granted... That the parents are there and, so, one can just go and play cricket or whatever... I started playing for India when I was 19 and, because of the travelling, Id hardly be at home...         
	Being passionate about wildlife and photography         
	Lets say photography is a part of me... Having a camera around my neck is normal... My brother (Dinesh) too is into photography and he gets more time... Ive also got a group of friends whove been into this for the last five-six years... Theyre interested in wildlife too... Its a common thread... However, because of my cricket commitments, I hardly get to spend time with the group... I love nature, like to go outdoors... Like things to be peaceful... Like tranquility... Like to get away from crowds, in fact, I dont like crowds... I quite like going to Kabini, which is near Mysore... Its a forest area and has a beautiful setting.         
	Whether hes conscious about role models having to do their bit for social causes         
	I am, yes... Its important to give something back to society... I have given my time and name for some causes... Unfortunately, I cant do anything full-time... But, yes, Ive done work for the Bangalore Kidney Foundation and the Shakthi Foundation in Chennai.         
	On being lauded for being an excellent ambassador for the country and for cricket         
	Its nice to get compliments, everybody likes appreciation...         
	Preferred way of unwinding         
	I tend to stick to a routine and I get to know when things arent going my way... I then know exactly where to put my finger at... Know what needs to be done to get back on track... Things then fall into place... I like going out for a meal... Like moving around with my camera.         
	Regrets         
	(After a pause) One, perhaps... If I had the exposure to support staff like physios and trainers from the time I took to cricket, then I would surely have been fitter.         
	Finally, how would he like to be remembered once hes through with cricket         
	Dont know... Probably as someone who gave 100 per cent all the time...

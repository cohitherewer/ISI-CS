            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chandigarh: Thirteen years ago a shy Abhinav Bindra accompanied his father Amarjit Singh and a family friend to the house of shooting coach Col. Jagir Singh Dhillon.         
	The meeting was very business-like. Abhinav had shown remarkable shooting skills with the air gun his father had presented to the then 13-year-old. Could Dhillon polish Abhinavs abilities was the question that crossed Abhinavs fathers mind.         
	I wanted Abhinav to be good in shooting. That he would go on to win international events, forget Olympics, never crossed my mind. I took him because my friend, now a state Congress leader, felt Abhinav had it in him to become a good shooter. I do not know how to express my feelings. Every moment is like a dream today, Amarjit said .         
	Neither the Punjab government nor the Sports Authority of India have helped Abhinav on his path of glory.         
	I will not say much as we have never expected anything from anyone. But I feel the government both at the state and the Centre should encourage sportspersons.         
	In this country the government sits up and takes notice only after someone has climbed Mount Everest. How he has done it and at what cost does not seem to interest anyone. It is tragic but thats the way sports is managed here, Bubli lamented.         
	Recalling Abhinavs formative years, his first coach Dhillon said the sharpshooters interest in the sport increased with each passing day.         
	To motivate him further, I promised him that his photographs would appear in newspapers if he excelled. Because of his dedication, hard work and family support, he has managed to make it to the front pages today, Dhillon gushed.

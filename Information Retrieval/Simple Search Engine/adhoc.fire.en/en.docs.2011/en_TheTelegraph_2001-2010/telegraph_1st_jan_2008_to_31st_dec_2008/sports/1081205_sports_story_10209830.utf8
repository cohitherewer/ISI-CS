The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj returns, Badrinath stays
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yuvraj returns, Badrinath stays
  - Selection meeting lasts just minutes Pujara has to wait       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Rahul Dravid has to deliver                                 
	Calcutta: If the selection committee meeting in Kanpur last month, to pick the squad for two ODIs, took unusually long, the one in Chennai on Thursday lasted just minutes.         
	The selectors didnt need more than a few minutes to choose the squad for the Tests against England, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Team India coach Gary Kirsten (a co-opted member of the selection committee), though, wasnt present as he has gone back to South Africa for a short vacation.         
	The meeting in Chennai was the first after Kanpur where there had been differences between the Krishnamachari Srikkanth-headed committee and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni over Rudra Pratap Singh.         
	There were no bad vibes at all, no signs of strain. In fact, I dont think Dhoni even spoke about RP at this meeting, the source added.         
	The debate (brief at that) was only over the extra middle-order batsmans berth. Subramaniam Badrinath kept his place, beating off the in-terrific-form Cheteshwar Pujaras challenge.         
	That Badrinath had been in the squad during the last series, against Australia, worked to his advantage.         
	Pujara, however, may not have to wait for too long.         
	There was talk that Piyush Chawla could keep left-armer Pragyan Ojha away from the third spinners berth, but that didnt happen.         
	Ojha, in any case, gives more variety given that offie Harbhajan Singh and leggie Amit Mishra are the spearheads.         
	Rahul Dravid has been retained and Yuvraj Singh recalled. That the script would unfold in this manner had been reported in these columns.         
	Dravid, though, has to deliver. He has been short on runs for quite some time and, if he doesnt, the selectors are bound to look at options.         
	The two-Test series begins in Chennai next Thursday, with the final Test being in Mohali, from December 19.         
	The series, by the way, will be the first after the retirements of top guns Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly.         
	THE SQUAD  
	Openers: Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay  
	Middle-order: Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Subramaniam Badrinath         
	Wicket-keeper: Mahendra Singh Dhoni         
	Spinners: Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Pragyan Ojha         
	Medium-pacers: Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Munaf Patel         
	Note: Vijay, Badrinath, Ojha and Munaf are expected to sit on the non-playing bench in Chennai. Unless, of course, somebody gets injured.

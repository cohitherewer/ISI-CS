                                                   Calcutta stars on Salgaocar wishlist 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       
	New Delhi: Salgaocar are planning to build a dream team despite being relegated to the I-League second division.         
	According to the club sources, the management is trying to lure away some of the top Calcutta stars with an assurance that the players would be free to chose a club of their own choice should the AIFF stick to its relegation rule and deny the Goan club a place in the premier division.         
	The club is already in contact with players like Sangram Mukherjee, Surkumar Singh, Deepak Mondal and Habibur Rehman from Calcutta and Dempo custodian Abhijit Mondal and Brazilian midfielder Beto, sources said.         
	The club is also willing to give a written assurance to potential signings that they wont be stopped from leaving if Salgaocar doesnt get a chance to continue in the I-League top tier, they added.         
	Salgaocar secretary Raj Gomes said: We are only taking players, who are willing to play in the second division. We are building a team for the next two years. We have a dream to fulfil, Gomes said.         
	Our plan is to win the Federation Cup that will enable us to represent India at the AFC Cup. A good team will also help us do well in tournaments like the Durand Cup or the IFA Shield, he maintained.         
	Salgaocar technical director Subhas Bhowmick, who is in the forefront of negotiations, remained noncommittal.         
	It is too early to say as no one has signed on the dotted lines so far, Bhowmick said.         
	It is good that the club management has increased the budget substantially. There are several top players who are willing to join Salgaocar because of my presence. They like me as a coach and wont hesitate to play in the second division, the former India forward added.         
	Meanwhile, Beto has said he would be leaving Dempo in the next season because of some personal problems.         
	I have had a great time with Dempo but it is time to move on after the AFC Cup. I have good offers from East Bengal and Salgaocar. I will decide only after the AFC Cup gets over, the prolific Brazilian scorer said.

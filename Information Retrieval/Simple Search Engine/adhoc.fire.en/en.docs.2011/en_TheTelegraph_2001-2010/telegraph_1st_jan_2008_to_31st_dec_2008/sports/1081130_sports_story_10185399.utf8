                                                                                                                                                                                                     Vasco ground Air India
                      
	Margao: Ravshan Tashabaevs second half goal guided Vasco to their first victory as they edged past Air India 1-0 in an ONGC I-League match at Nehru Stadium on Saturday.         
	The all-important goal was scored in the 65th minute as Tashabaevs left footer from close range off a pass by Menino Fernandes found the net.         
	Vasco, who on Saturday finished their first leg engagement, are at the bottom with five points from 11 matches. Air India remained on 16 points, also from 11 matches.         
	Air-India too made two changes bringing in goalkeeper C. Sarath for injured Arup Debnath and Kailash Singh in place of Emmanuel Ovieghara who missed many scoring chances in earlier matches.         
	But things did not work for Air-India as they lacked the sting to trouble the rival defence with Man of the Match Covan Lawrence did well to cut off the rivals moves.           (PTI)

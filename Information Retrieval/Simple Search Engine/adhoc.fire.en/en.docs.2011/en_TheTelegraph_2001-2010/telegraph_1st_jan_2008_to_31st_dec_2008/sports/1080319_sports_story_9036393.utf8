	Calcutta: Confusion prevailed over the appointment of the next chief executive of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with preferred candidate Imtiaz Patel on Tuesday making it clear that he was still considering whether to accept the high-profile job.         
	It was learnt that Patel had applied for the post without informing his current employers, SuperSport, in South Africa and that has left them unhappy.         
	I enjoy a most rewarding and happy career in my current role as CEO of SuperSport, which is a dynamic organisation within a wonderful international group, Patel said in Durban. I will therefore be considering my position very carefully during the coming weeks and will be engaging in discussions with the ICC during this period.         
	The ICC announced on Monday that Patel was the unanimous choice to succeed current Malcolm Speed, whose term will end in June.         
	Patels current employers, the Supersport Television Company in South Africa, also said they did not want to lose a man of Patels calibre.         
	Nothing has been formalised yet. Its a personal issue for Imtiaz but it is something the Multichoice board will get involved in. They wont want to lose a man of his calibre, said spokesman Guy Hawthone. Multichoice is the parent company of SuperSport.         
	Pending negotiations with Patel, it is hoped that he will take over from Malcolm Speed during the annual conference at the end of June, the ICC said in a release.

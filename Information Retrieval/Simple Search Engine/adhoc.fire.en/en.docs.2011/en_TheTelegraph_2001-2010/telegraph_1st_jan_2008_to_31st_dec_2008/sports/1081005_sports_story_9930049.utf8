The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bedi: Kumble still the best
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bedi: Kumble still the best
                      
	New Delhi: After an ordinary performance in Sri Lanka, Anil Kumble came under quite a bit of criticism but former spin greats say the Indian Test captain is still the best bowler .         
	This is what Bishan Singh Bedi and Erapalli Prasnna had to say on the India captain:         
	Bedi: I have seen a lot of Indian bowlers over the years and for me, Kumble is the best ever. He is still Indias strike bowler and the best bowler. It is a fact of life that Kumble has grown a little old now and his performance has dipped but he is still a deadly bowler. Captaincy has done wonders to his career. His greatest strength is his discipline, dedication, attitude and approach towards his game and the sport in general. He (Kumble) is the man at the helm, the man in charge and knows till when to carry on.         
	Prasanna: This is the weakest Australian batting line-up that has ever travelled to India. It is advantageous for Kumble that he does not have to bowl at top-quality batsmen. A lot depends on how well he fares and the series will be won or loss on that. He is old but is still extremely consistent with his line and length. Watching him bowl recently, I think he has still got a lot of fire in him. I think captaincy has motivated him even more and he is very determined to do well against Australia.

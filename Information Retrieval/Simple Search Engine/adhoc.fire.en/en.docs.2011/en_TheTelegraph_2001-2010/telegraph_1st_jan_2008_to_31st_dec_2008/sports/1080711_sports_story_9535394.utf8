The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ric puts in papers, leaves for home
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ric puts in papers, leaves for home
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Charlesworth                           
	New Delhi: Ric Charlesworth has resigned as the technical advisor of Indian hockey.         
	According to sources in the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), the legendary Australian, who put in his papers last week, has already left for home and would not be coming back to India.         
	Charlesworth was not too happy with the system in India and preferred to resign, said Aslam Sher Khan, chairman of the IOA appointed ad-hoc selection committee, which currently looks after the affairs of the Indian hockey, both men and women.         
	Confirming the news, a sports ministry official said: Yes, Charlesworth has resigned and has asked us to clear his dues. I am not in a position to say anything more on this.         
	IOA sources said that Charlesworth, who was appointed by the sports ministry to work under the now deposed Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), did not like the way he was pushed around by three different agencies continuously.         
	He was appointed by the ministry and was supposed to work under the direction of the IHF, sources said. At the same time, he was receiving instructions from the Sports Authority of India to go on different assignments. He did not like the atmosphere and resigned.         
	A senior IOA official, however, said there was some resentment against the Australian coach, who reportedly had asked for a huge hike in salary.         
	Charlesworth was appointed technical advisor last year but was hardly allowed to work by the IHF, then headed by K.P.S. Gill.         
	Finally, the IHF had to accept the Australian after the Indian team failed to qualify for the Olympics for the first time.         
	The IHF, which then came under immense pressure from the International Hockey Federation (FIH) and the sports ministry, was forced to utilise Charlesworths expertise in all the national teams including the senior mens squad.         
	Since then the former Australia captain had been working with both the mens and the womens teams.

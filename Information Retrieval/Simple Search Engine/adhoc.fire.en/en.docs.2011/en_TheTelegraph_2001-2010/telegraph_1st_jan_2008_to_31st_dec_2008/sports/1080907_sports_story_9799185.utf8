The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hamilton grabs pole
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hamilton grabs pole
                      
	Spa-Francorchamps (Belgium): McLarens Lewis Hamilton was perfectly placed to extend his Formula One championship lead after seizing pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix on Saturday.         
	The 23-year-old Briton will start Sundays race with Ferraris Brazilian Felipe Massa, his main title rival, alongside on the front row.         
	Ferraris world champion Kimi Raikkonen, who has won the last three Belgian Grands Prix at his favourite circuit, qualified fourth with fellow-Finn Heikki Kovalainen third for McLaren.         
	The pole position, with a fastest lap of one minute 47.338 seconds on a damp and overcast afternoon in the Ardennes forests, was Hamiltons 11th of his 30-race career and fifth of the season. Hamilton leads Massa by six points in the championship with six races left, while Raikkonen is a further seven points adrift and struggling to end a winless streak dating back to the end of April.

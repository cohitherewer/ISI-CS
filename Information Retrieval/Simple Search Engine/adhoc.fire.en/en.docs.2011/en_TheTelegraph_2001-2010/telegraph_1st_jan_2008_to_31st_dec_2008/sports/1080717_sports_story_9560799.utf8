            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Wednesday named a provisional squad of 30 players for the ICC Champions Trophy tournament to be played in September.         
	According to a CSA release, the squad, which will be cut to 15 before the start of the tournament has four uncapped players including  Nashua Dolphins left-arm seamer Yusuf Abdullah along with allrounder Johann Louw, big-hitting Nashua Cape Cobras allrounder Rory Kleinveldt and Nashua Titans seamer Ethy Mbhalati.         
	Talking about the new faces, chief selector Joubert Strydom said: They are all players who have done well in domestic cricket in both forms of the limited overs game.         
	The rest of the squad is made up of tried and tested players who have represented South Africa with distinction over the past year. We have every confidence in them to bring a major ICC trophy home, he added.         
	Gerald Majola, CSA CEO, said: Since winning the inaugural version of this event in 1998, the Proteas have not featured to their full potential in international tournaments.         
	This is something that CSA and the Proteas Team Management have been addressing and we are confident of providing a formidable challenge this time. The Proteas are rated one of the best limited overs teams in world cricket, and this will be a motivating factor for the Proteas at this tournament.

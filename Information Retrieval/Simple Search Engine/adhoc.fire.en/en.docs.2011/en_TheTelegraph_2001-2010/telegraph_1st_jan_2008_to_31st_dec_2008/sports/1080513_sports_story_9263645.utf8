	Mumbai: Mumbai Indians hopes got a big shot in the arm when their icon player and captain Sachin Tendulkar Monday declared himself fully fit to play his first IPL match against Chennai Super Kings at Wankhede Stadium Wednesday.         
	Yes I will be playing the match on Wednesday. I feel very comfortable. It has been tough and disappointing to have missed the two Tests against South Africa and the first seven IPL ties, Tendulkar told reporters after a strenuous practice sessions under lights.         
	It has been hard work and with help from the physio and masseur, Tendulkar, who has not played a competitive match since march-end due to a groin injury, said.         
	Tendulkar said though ace South African allrounder Shaun Pollock had done a commendable job as captainhe would take over the reins now that he is fit. Shaun Pollock was the makeshift captain and has done a terrific job but I will be captaining the side, Tendulkar said.         
	He will open the innings with Sri Lankan ace Sanath Jayasuriya, Tendulkar said.           (PTI)

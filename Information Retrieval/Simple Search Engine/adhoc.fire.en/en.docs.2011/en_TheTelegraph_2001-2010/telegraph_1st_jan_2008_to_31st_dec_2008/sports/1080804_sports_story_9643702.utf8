                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chandhok finishes fourth
                      
	Budapest: A second successive podium finish eluded Karun Chandhok as the Isport international driver finished 4th in the feature race of the GP2 series at the Hungaroring.         
	The 24-year-old from Chennai, started from 5th on the grid but could have been higher had he not been forced into a spin by a slowing car ahead of him that caused his engine to stall.         
	Chandhok was on the front row when the incident happened after Jerome dAmbrosio suddenly slowed in front of him.         
	I had to move to the inside to avoid him, but in doing so I clipped the kerb and spun, Karun said.         
	 I almost had to come to a halt to avoid a major crash. We showed we had good pace, and as usual around it here it was hard work in the high temperatures, said the youngster.         
	I didnt quite max out the first set of tyres, which was still good enough for second at the time, so Im disappointed I didnt get a chance to prove I could have gone quicker on the second set of fresh tyres, he said.

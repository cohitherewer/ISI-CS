                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rohit, Ojha included; Zaheer returns
            A STAFF REPORTER                Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni                             
	Calcutta: Uncapped middle-order batsman Rohit Sharma and left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha were included in the 16-member Test squad for the series in Sri Lanka.         
	Wasim Jaffer, Yuvraj Singh, Irfan Pathan and Piyush Chawla lost their places while ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni decided to take a break. Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khan were back after injury lay-offs while Harbhajan Singh returned from a five-ODI ban imposed by the BCCI for slapping Sreesanth during the IPL.         
	Also back were Gautam Gambhir, Parthiv Patel and Munaf Patel. Dinesh Karthik will be the first-choice wicketkeeper. Sreesanth is yet to regain fitness. The squad includes seven specialist batsmen, four pacers, three spinners and two wicket-keepers.         
	MS Dhoni had conveyed his request to skip the Test series to the selectors. He has accordingly been rested for the series, the BCCI said in a statement after the selection committee meeting in Mumbai.         
	In Dhonis absence, the squad will have a new vice-captain in Virender Sehwag.         
	Ojha impressed with his limited exposure during the Asia Cup. Its a dream come true. Any cricketer would want and expect to play for the country, Ojha said.         
	I didnt particularly think about the Sri Lanka series but I knew if I keep bowling well I would get a chance. I will be concentrating on my flight and changes in pace and will generally try to bowl like I do in the Ranji Trophy.         
	Gambhir forces his way back into the side after a string of impressive performances in ODIs and domestic tournaments. Parthiv last played for India in October 2004. Karthik last played the Bangalore Test against Pakistan, which Dhoni had to skip due to an ankle injury. Karthik had played as a specialist opener in the Test series in Bangladesh and England last year, and in the home Tests against Pakistan.                     
	Injury-prone Munaf Patel was also recalled after missing the Asia Cup and forms part of the four-pronged pace attack. Zaheer, who did not play this year since picking up an injury in the Boxing Day Test, makes a comeback to the side while Sreesanth was not considered because of fitness concerns.         
	The squad is set to depart on July 15 and would open the tour with a three-day tie starting on July 18. The Tests are scheduled in Colombo (first from July 23-27 and third from August 8-12) and Galle (from July 31-August 4).

	New Delhi: Ace shuttler Chetan Anand and the mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V. Diju eased into the second round of the Denmark Open, even as compatriots Arvind Bhatt and Aditi Mutatkar crashed out of the Super Series event in Odense Wednesday.

	Anand Pawar also followed suit and was shown the door by Malaysian Choong Hann Wong 17-21, 21-12, 21-18 in the opening round.         
	In the womens singles, Aditi hit a low after the high of the Dutch Open Grand Prix, as Canadian Anna Rice got the better of the Indian 21-18, 21-15.         
	Meanwhile, Jwala and Shruti Kurien will pair up to meet local challengers Christinna Pedersen and Mie Schjoett-Kristensen in the womens doubles category.

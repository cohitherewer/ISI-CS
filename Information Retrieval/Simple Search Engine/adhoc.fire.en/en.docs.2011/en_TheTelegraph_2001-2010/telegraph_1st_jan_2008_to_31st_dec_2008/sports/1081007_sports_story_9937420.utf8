The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We want PCB to invite a World XI, says Ramiz
                                                                                                                                                                                                       We want PCB to invite a World XI, says Ramiz
    - Law minister accepts suggestion from former captains           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Wasim Akram                                 
	Calcutta: Four former captains have suggested that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) organise a best-of-three ODI series against an Invitation World XI, at the earliest, idea being to signal that the country is safe for international fixtures.         
	Last months Champions Trophy got postponed, owing to security-related concerns, and there may be no international cricket till Team Indias tour, from early January 2009.         
	We made the suggestion during our meeting with law minister Farooq Naek in Lahore on Sunday. The minister, who is reviewing the PCBs constitution, will convey that to the appropriate quarters, one of the ex-captains, Ramiz Raja, told The Telegraph on Monday morning.                   Ramiz Raja      
	Ramiz, also a former chief executive of the PCB, was accompanied by Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar, Inzamam-ul Haq (all ex-captains) and Mushtaq Ahmed (assistant coach during Bob Woolmers tenure).         
	Asked why they hadnt made the suggestion directly to sports minister Najmuddin Khan, who has made himself acting chairman of the PCB, Ramiz replied: The suggestion just came up during our meeting... We met Naek as hes reviewing the constitution...         
	The PCB has been without a chairman ever since Dr Nasim Ashraf, a Pervez Musharraf-appointee, resigned in August.                   Saeed Anwar      
	As reported, the former captains and Mushtaq have requested Naek to convince his colleague to send a cricket person, as PCBs representative, to the International Cricket Council meeting this month.         
	Khan has unilaterally announced that hell be going.         
	The quintet also suggested that a constitutionally-empowered cricket committee be constituted, with its members each having played a minimum of 50 Tests.         
	The running of cricket should get divorced from the day-to-day functioning of the PCB... Too many non-technical people are in positions where they shouldnt be... We want the cricket aspect to be run exclusively by people with a cricket background, Ramiz explained.         
	[Later in the day, an agency report from Pakistan said that the suggestion had been accepted by Naek. The cricket committee would have five members, with a tenure of two-three years.]                   Inzamam-ul Haq      
	Ramiz added, somewhat emotionally: We dont want cricket to be compromised by non-cricket people... Its not that we ourselves want some position in the PCB... Far from it... But, yes, weve offered our services as the current state of affairs has saddened us deeply Cricket in Pakistan cant be reduced to this state...         
	The ex-captains and Mushtaq, whod occasionally been interacting informally, decided to meet Naek when it got to the enough is enough stage. I didnt have to persuade anybody... If anything at all, I probably got their passion juices flowing, Ramiz remarked.         
	As for the constitution, its being reviewed as many feel the PCB chairman has unlimited powers and that such sweeping authority isnt exactly required.         
	Naek, by the way, has asked Ramiz to prepare a paper and hell be doing so at the earliest. Ive sought about 15 days as Ill soon be travelling to India for the Australia series, Ramiz stated.         
	Ramiz wont be doing live commentary, but will be Neos studio expert, based in Mumbai.

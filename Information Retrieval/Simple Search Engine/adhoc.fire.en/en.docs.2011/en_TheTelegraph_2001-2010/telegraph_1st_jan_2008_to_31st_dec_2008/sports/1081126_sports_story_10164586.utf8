The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | JCT look to extend run
                                                                                                                                                                                                     JCT look to extend run
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: An injury-hit JCT will look to overcome indifferent form and try and sustain their winning momentum when they take on Mumbai FC in a tenth round clash of the I-League at the Cooperage here on Wednesday.         
	JCT, who stunned East Bengal 1-0 at home on Saturday, will be without the services of custodian Karanjit Singh due to a knee injury while midfielders Baldeep Singh Sr. and Baljit Singh Sahni, who missed the action over the weekend, will also be on the sidelines.         
	More than fitness, however, it is the lack of consistency that has been a major issue for the Phagwara unit. The side began the season with two strong wins, against Dempo (2-1) and Mohammedan Sporting (2-0), in the first three matches, but have failed to maintain that sparkling form thereafter.We havent been consistent at all. There have been changes in the team, there are a lot of youngsters, coach Sukhvinder Singh said on Tuesday.         
	So, after nine matches, JCT are languishing at eighth place on the league table with three wins, defeats and draws each. But the win over East Bengal, Sukhvinder hoped, has seen the team turn the corner.         
	Results are not based purely on superiority. In the last match, we played better from the start, whereas against Air India (to whom they lost 1-0 at the same venue two rounds ago) we played better in the first half and not in the second. It all depends on what level we play on that day, he said.         
	Besides the form, adjusting to the warm conditions of the coastal city would be another factor for JCT.         
	We are coming from the northern winter. Besides, we are playing within three days of our last match. We came here yesterday (Monday), hopefully by tomorrow the players would have acclimatised, he said.         
	On the other hand, Mumbai FC will have their tails up. After the 2-0 loss against Air India, the I-League debutants have managed four draws, three of them away.         
	That has them sixth with 13 points, and the rookies will hope that a return to home conditions will help them get back to winning ways.

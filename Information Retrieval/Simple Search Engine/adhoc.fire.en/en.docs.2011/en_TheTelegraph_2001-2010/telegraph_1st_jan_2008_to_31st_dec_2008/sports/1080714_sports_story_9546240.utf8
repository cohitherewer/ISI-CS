The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lawyer: Shoaib wont pay up
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lawyer: Shoaib wont pay up
                  Shoaib Akhtar could miss out on Champions Trophy                     
	Karachi: Shoaib Akhtars chances of being named in Pakistans preliminary squad for the Champions Trophy have receded after his lawyer, Abid Hasan Minto, on Sunday said that the pacer would not pay the hefty fine demanded by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), until the court pronounced its verdict on his writ petition.         
	The PCB postponed the announcement of its preliminary squad for the Champions Trophy till Tuesday and sent a notice to Shoaib asking him to pay the seven million-rupee fine imposed on him by an appeals tribunal in June.         
	Shoaib and fellow pacer Mohammed Asif were selected by the national selection committee in Pakistans 30-member preliminary squad. The list of probables was to be released by the PCB on Friday, the deadline set by the international cricket council.         
	A PCB spokesman said on Friday: Shoaibs name would only be considered for selection if he clears the fine first.         
	However, Abid Hasan Minto said Shoaib would pay the fine imposed on him by the appellate tribunal only when the Lahore High Court will make a final decision on the writ petition filed by him against the ban and fine.         
	Shoaib will pay the fine as soon as the High Court decides the matter (in September).         
	If they (the PCB) think the fine payment is a norm for inclusion in the squad, then it is up to them. If they want to deny the national team his presence and keep someone like him away from the team... then it is their decision, he added.         
	Pakistan host the Champions Trophy in September.         
	Shoaib was banned for five years by the PCB in March for various acts of indiscipline. He appealed against the ban to an appeals tribunal which reduced it to 18 months but imposed the fine on him.         
	The fast bowler however, then filed a petition to the Lahore High Court against the ban and fine last month.         
	The court suspended the ban but refused to clear the fine until the case is taken up for regular hearing in September. Minto said a reply will be sent to the PCB on Monday regarding the fine.         
	According to the Minto, the payment of the fine had nothing to do with the court decision allowing him to play for Pakistan even though the court will hear the case sometime in September.

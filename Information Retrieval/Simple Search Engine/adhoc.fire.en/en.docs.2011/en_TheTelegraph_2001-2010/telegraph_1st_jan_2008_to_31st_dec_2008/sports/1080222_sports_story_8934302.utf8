                                                   PCB sends BCCI formal proposal
                      
	 Karachi: A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official disclosed on Thursday that it has sent a formal proposal to the BCCI for a short series of three one-day Internationals against India in mid-March.         
	The official said Pakistan was keen to host India for the one-day series to fill in the free time as Cricket Australia have shortened their tour of Pakistan by 18 days and will tour from March 29.

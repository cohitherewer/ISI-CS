	Nagpur: Ashok Dinda bagged five-wickets to reduce Vidarbha to 62 for seven in their second innings but an unbeaten 72-run stand between Srikanth Wagh and Ranjit Paradkar helped the hosts salvage a draw in the Ranji Trophy Plate Group match here on Monday.         
	The visitors garnered three points to take their tally to 21. Bengal will play in the Ranji Trophy Plate Group semi-final against Goa in New Delhi from December 18-21.         
	Bengal selectors on Monday included Sourav Ganguly in the 15-member squad for the semi-final match against Goa.         
	Earlier, resuming at the overnight score of 371 for six, Bengal lost two quick wickets  that of Avik Chowdhary (49) and R. Kundu (49) within five runs. Tailenders S. Sarkar (21) and Dinda (11 ..) then bailed Bengal out with a face-saving ninth wicket stand of 27 runs as Vidarbha failed to press home the early advantage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Swiss meet Czechs in opener
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Swiss meet Czechs in opener
                      
	Basel: Euro 2008 gets underway on Saturday with co-hosts Switzerland pitting their promising young team against an experienced Czech Republic side keen to prove their best days are not behind them.         
	Koebi Kuhns Swiss squad are one of the youngest at these finals but include several players who have already experienced two major tournaments. But the international retirements of Karel Poborsky and Pavel Nedved along with the loss through injury of captain Tomas Rosicky have raised doubts over the pedigree of this squad.         
	I dont know why people would say we are not as good as we were before, midfielder David Jarolim told reporters at the teams training ground in Seefeld, Austria.         
	Neutral fans will hope to see plenty of goals with the group A game bringing together two of the tournaments most prolific strikers.         
	Frei has scored 35 times in 59 matches for Switzerland while towering Czech forward Jan Koller boasts a record of 54 goals in 87 internationals.         
	Switzerland will struggle to contain the 2.02-metre tall Koller, particularly with regular central defender Patrick Mueller yet to prove his match fitness after missing the majority of the season through injury.         
	We wont be man-marking Koller, said Swiss assistant coach Michel Pont. Our team has coped with Zinedine Zidane (of France) and plenty of other great players in the past without assigning defenders to particular players.

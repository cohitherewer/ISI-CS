The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians mark had more value: Sourav 
                                                   Indians mark had more value: Sourav 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly on Saturday congratulated the South African pair of Graeme Smith and Neil Mckenzie for setting a world record opening stand, but said the old feat by the Indian pair of Pankaj Roy and Vinoo Mankad had more value.         
	Records are meant to be broken... This is a normal thing. But I will give more value to the Indian pair since they scripted such a marathon partnership against New Zealand, who had a better attack compared to Bangladesh, Sourav said.

	Calcutta: Former Bengal chief minister Siddhartha Sankar Rays name will be proposed by the Jagmohan Dalmiya group for the post of chairman of the Board of Trustees in the ensuing Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections, a Dalmiya-aide informed on Thursday.         
	Ray is also a current member of the present Board of Trustees, which is headed by Chandi Ganguly.         
	After a late-night meeting on Thursday with his supporters, Dalmiya decided to announce his full panel for the forthcoming CAB election (July 29) on Friday.         
	Dalmiya is likely to file his nomination at the CAB personally on Friday.         
	While Samar Kar, Shib Kumar Kalyani and Shibaji Duttas names will be filed for three vice-president posts, the fourth candidate will be nominated from the districts later on.

                                                   Hussey: Important to set goals right
                      
	 Michael Hussey believes the spate of controversies and the verbal duels with India will not distract his team when they go into the finals.         
	I think it is important that we dont let all of the distractions play any part in our mind if we play on emotion sometimes those distractions can have a detrimental effect on your performance, Hussey said.         
	So it is important that we just concentrate on our plans, our goals and execute our skills as well as possible.         
	Gilchrist balm         
	 The lucrative Indian Premier League could repair the bad blood between the Indian and Australian cricket teams, Adam Gilchrist has said. Gilchrist conceded the season had got out of hand and was exhausting, partly due to the off-field spats between the teams.         
	I think the situation this summer has got out of hand somewhat, he told The Daily Telegraph.         
	He hoped relationships between international players could be restored by the cultural mix of the IPL.

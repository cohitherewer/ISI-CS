The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sir Alex offers sympathy to Arsene Wenger
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sir Alex offers sympathy to Arsene Wenger
            TIM RICH                Ferguson (top) and Wenger                             
	Maybe it is because Arsenal no longer appear a real threat to his title ambitions or maybe it is because the early enmity has dissolved into a mutual respect but Sir Alex Ferguson had only sympathy for Arsene Wengers plight.         
	The Manchester United manager had sat in the directors box at Anfield to watch Arsenals hopes of silverware implode in a Champions League quarter final second leg, which, as a match, Ferguson thought had everything.         
	He left when Theo Walcotts extraordinary run was converted by Emmanuel Adebayor, thinking Arsenal were through, and was on the stairs to the reception when Liverpool were awarded the decisive penalty. It would, he said Friday, be a difficult defeat to recover from.         
	There is a theory that Arsenals decline began at Old Trafford in February, when they were shot to pieces by Manchester United in an FA Cup tie. Afterwards, Wenger said he thought the damage could be contained. In this the Arsenal manager was wrong. Eleven subsequent games have seen only two wins, while in the Premier League Arsenal have taken eight points from a possible 21.         
	It is a theory to which Ferguson does not subscribe. Arsenal have had some injuries that has made it very difficult for them to rest players.         
	I am telling you, you cannot win games consistently without your best team. If you go back to the time Wenger won the league against us for the first time in 1998, we played them in a crucial game at Old Trafford.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Leander, Lukas eye 2nd in a row
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Leander, Lukas eye 2nd in a row
                  Leander Paes                     
	New Delhi: The profligate pair of Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy kept themselves in contention for their second consecutive ATP doubles title as the top seeded duo reached the final of the $869,000 Japan Open in Tokyo on Saturday.         
	According to information received here, the Indo-Czech team defeated Robert Kendrick of America and Jarko Nieminen of Finland 6-4, 7-6 (4) in one hour and 11 minutes in the semi-final of the hard court ATP event.         
	The winners of the Thailand Open last week squandered as many as eight breakpoints  five in the first set and three in the second  before romping home after a tight contest.         
	They could break their rivals only once in the match but scored points when it mattered most as they prevailed in the tie-breaker in the second set.         
	They will fight it out for the trophy against unseeded pair of Mikhail Youzhny of Russia and Mischa Zverev of Germany, who toppled third seed pair Jordan Kerr of Australia and Robert Lindstedt of Sweden 6-2, 4-6, 10-8 in the second semi-final.         
	Meanwhile, Czech Tomas Berdych stunned second seed Andy Roddick 6-7, 7-5, 7-6 to reach to the final. The ninth seed will face a player who has won 29 of his previous 30 matches in Sundays final in the shape of Argentine Juan Martin Del Potro. Fifth seed Del Potro beat Frenchman Richard Gasquet 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 in the first semi-final.         
	Roddick, one of several players still chasing a spot in the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, took the first set on a tie-break after slamming a 10th ace past Berdych.         
	Berdych struck back in the second, breaking Roddicks serve in the 11th game and then restored parity by forcing the American into a wild forehand.         
	Roddick jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the decider but the former US Open champion faltered while serving for the match at 5-3 and was made to pay.         
	Berdych pushed the set to another tie-break and the Czech quickly raced to a 6-1 advantage, wrapping up proceedings on his third match point with his 17th ace.         
	Fifth seed Del Potro, who recently helped his country book their place in the Davis Cup final, took just over two hours to see off Gasquet, last years beaten finalist in Tokyo.         
	A double-fault from fourth seed Gasquet handed Del Potro a 3-2 lead and the Argentine wrapped up the first set by breaking again with a fizzing forehand down the line.         
	Gasquet broke early in the second before levelling the match by threading a forehand past Del Potros desperate lunge. But it was Del Potro who held his nerve, the 20-year-old securing his place in the final when Gasquet blazed a forehand wide.

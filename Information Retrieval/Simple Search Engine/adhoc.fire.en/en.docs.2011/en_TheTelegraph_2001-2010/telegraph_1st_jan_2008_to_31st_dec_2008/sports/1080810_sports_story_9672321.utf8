	Beijing: The Indian archery squad flew into Beijing brimming with confidence. After the first days show, it seems the confidence wasnt misplaced.         
	At the Olympic Green Archery Field on Saturday, after the individual ranking round, Mangal Singh Champia finished second in the mens category, while Dola Banerjee amp; Co. were placed at a creditable sixth in the womens team event.         
	Indias lone male archer Champia finished with 678 out of a possible 720 points. He was on top after the first half with a score of 342. In the second he fell behind a bit to total 336 points.         
	He finished on joint second spot with Viktor Ruban of Ukraine, a mere point behind Mexican Juan Rene Serrano.         
	According to Champia, there was heavy wind and it was not continuous so I did not do well in the second half.         
	Up next for Champia is Irans Vaezi Hojjatolah, who finished 63rd with 604 points.         
	Laishram Bombayla Devi was the best among Indian women, finishing 22nd with a score of 637, followed by Dola at 31st with 633 points. With a score of 627, V. Pranitha ended 37th.         
	The team total of 1897 placed the Indians at sixth, which means in the 10-team competition they get a bye in the first round.         
	India will meet China in the quarter finals on Sunday.         
	Am happy to have finished sixth, Dola told The Telegraph, adding that she would have been happier had they finished fifth.         
	That would have helped them avoid a possible clash with China in the last-eight stage.         
	But then, continued Dola, we have beaten the Chinese thrice in the last 18 months. So they arent really that formidable. Only thing is that they have the benefit of home advantage.         
	A victory over China will possibly set them up against second seeds Britain in the semi-finals.         
	The Korean threesome of Park-Sung Hyun, Yun-Ok Hee and Joo-Hyun Jung broke the Olympic record by totalling 2004 points to stand first in the womens team event. The previous record of 1194 was once again held by Korea, created during the Sydney Olympics.         
	Korea have won all five womens archery titles since the team competition format was first included in the Games 20 years ago.         
	Great Britain finished second with 1925 followed by China with 1916. Poland and France were fifth and sixth, respectively.         
	In the individual section, Bombayla will face Iwona Marcinkiewicz of Poland, who finished 43rd with a score of 620, while Dola will take on Marie-Pier Beaudet (628) of Canada, who finished 34th. Pranitha will play Australian Jane Waller, who shot 634 to finish 28th.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal signed Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu on Tuesday but failed to solve the dilemma over their third foreigner with only a couple of days left before the start of their I-League campaign.         
	According to sources, coach Stanley Rozario is still undecided on taking Suley Musah as his third foreigner as it has been understood that the defenders lack of pace has been exposed during training.         
	City rivals Mohun Bagan were also unable to ensure Brazilian Marcos Pereiras service as the tussle with JCT over his lien continues.         
	Coach Karim Bencharifa said his team had enough firepower to overcome the absence of a third foreigner during the early part of the league.         
	Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan announced a pact with multiple service providers Suvidhaa for I-League ticket distribution. Fans will be able to buy I-League tickets for Bagans matches from Suvidhaas various outlets across the city.

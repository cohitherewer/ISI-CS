The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav sets sights on century
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sourav sets sights on century
  - Former captain fourth Indian to score 7000 runs       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly in Mohali on Friday                                 
	Chandigarh: With all the attention on Sachin Tendulkar, understandably so, Sourav Gangulys milestone (7,000 Test runs) almost became a non event on Friday. Not that the soon-to-retire former India captain seemed to mind, though.         
	Im happy... Not many have scored 7,000-plus runs (hes the fourth Indian and 33rd overall) and, so, theres reason to be pleased, Sourav told The Telegraph on returning to the Taj.         
	He added: Its nice to have been unbeaten (54) at stumps and, yes, Im looking forward to getting a hundred...         
	Saluting Sachin, Sourav (whod been at the other end when Brian Laras record got eclipsed) said: Hes phenomenal... A class act, thats the best way to describe him... Sharing the dressing room with him has been fantastic.         
	Sourav, incidentally, had also been the non-striker when Sachin got the record-scripting 35th Test hundred, at the Kotla, almost three years ago.         
	Yes, indeed... And, dont forget that I had been at the other end when Rahul Dravid got his 10,000th Test run (against South Africa, in March)... One feels good when teammates achieve something, Sourav remarked.         
	He has totalled 127 in the first three innings of the series and has looked pretty comfortable, but doesnt intend reviewing his decision to retire at the end of this latest face-off versus the Australians.         
	Ive made the decision and that stays, Sourav signed off, as he prepared to read the congratulatory messages texted to him.

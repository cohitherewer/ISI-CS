	Madrid: Villarreal beat Barcelona 2-1 at the Nou Camp to leave Real Madrid eight points clear at the top of the Primera Liga on Sunday.         
	Real came back to beat Espanyol 2-1 at the Bernabeu on Saturday but second-placed Barcelona failed to repeat the feat after going behind to a first-half penalty from Marcos Senna.         
	Xavi equalised in the second half but substitute Jon Dahl Tomasson crowned an impressive all-round display from Villarreal with a winner nine minutes from time.         
	Its still only March and competitions arent decided in March. We have to keep on fighting until all the games have been played, Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard said.         
	Real have 62 points, Barcelona 54 and Villarreal, who completed a double over Barcelona in the league, move on to 50.         
	Earlier, Racing Santander beat 10-man Real Betis 3-0 at home to climb to fifth on 44 points, the same as fourth-placed Atletico Madrid who lost 2-1 away to Real Zaragoza on Saturday.         
	The Kings Cup semi-finalists made the most of the extra man when Betis had defender Melli sent off just after half time.         
	Sevilla recovered from their midweek Champions League exit to beat bottom club Levante 2-1 at the Sanchez Pizjuan to go sixth on 42.         
	Elsewhere, the worst defensive performance of the day came as Recreativo Huelva folded to a 7-1 defeat away to Real Mallorca.         
	Venezuela forward Juan Arango scored a hat-trick while Spain striker Daniel Guiza and midfielder Borja Valero each bagged a pair inside the games opening 50 minutes for the islanders biggest ever win in the top flight.

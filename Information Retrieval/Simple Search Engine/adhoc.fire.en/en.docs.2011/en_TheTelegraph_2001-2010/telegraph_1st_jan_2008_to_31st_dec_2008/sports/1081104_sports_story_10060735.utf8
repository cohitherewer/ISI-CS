The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Radcliffe bounces back in style
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Radcliffe bounces back in style
            Tom Knight in New York            Paula Radcliffe                           
	Paula Radcliffes love affair with New York continued on Sunday when she again proved that when she is fit and healthy, she is the worlds finest marathon runner.         
	Only 11 weeks after she struggled home injured and in 23rd place at the Olympics in Beijing, Radcliffe confirmed her return to form by claiming her third New York Marathon title in 2hr 23 min 56 sec.         
	Only Grete Waitz has won more, with nine victories between 1978 and 1988 and it was fitting that the legendary Norwegian was among the first to congratulate Radcliffe on the podium.         
	This was Radcliffes seventh victory in seven big city starts and while her Olympic failures in Athens and Beijing remain constant reminders of her fallibility at the highest level, there is no doubting her ability to bounce back from adversity.         
	For all her recent setbacks, which included the stress fracture of her left femur she sustained in May, this will rank among Radcliffes greatest performances as it came with the perfect execution of the bravest of tactics.         
	Despite the cool temperatures at the Staten Island start and a fierce north-easterly, she led from the start and controlled the race throughout.         
	With a group of up to six women, including Gete Wami, Kara Goucher and the eventual runner-up, Ludmila Petrova happy to follow her pace, Radcliffe ploughed on through 20 miles before accelerating.         
	The change of pace saw every challenger fall away and at 22 miles, Radcliffes victory was assured.         
	She covered the second half of the race almost four minutes quicker than the first and the nearest anyone came to challenging the Briton was Ludmila Petrova, the 40 year-old champion from 2000 but even she was almost two minutes behind at the finish.         
	Radcliffe said: No-one else wanted to lead and it was really windy out there. I knew that everyone was lining up behind me and was careful to stay relaxed and in control because I wanted to run negative splits. I came here very confident because my training since the Olympics was so good.         
	Goucher, the American who was third on her marathon debut, put it more succinctly. She said: Today, Paula just hammered us.         
	As in 2007, Radcliffe crossed the finish line at the Tavern on the Green with her arms aloft and then scooped up her daughter, Isla before waving to the massive crowd.         
	She added: Isla puts everything in perspective. She is the best thing I have ever achieved and she loves me whether I win or lose.         
	Radcliffe will leave New York with a winners cheque for $165,000, scant consolation for the Olympic gold that remains so elusive.         
	There were many who questioned the wisdom of Radcliffe racing again so soon after the Olympics but she has defied the doubters yet again.         
	Her target remains London 2012. I accept that there is a finite number of good marathons in anyone but I believe that the number varies from person to person.

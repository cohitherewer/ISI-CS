The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds hits IPLs fastest century
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Symonds hits IPLs fastest century
                  Andrew Symonds on way to the tournaments fastest century on Thursday                     
	Hyderabad: Andrew Symonds struck form, hitting the fastest hundred of the tournament to steer Deccan Chargers to a challenging 214 for five in their Indian Premier League encounter against Rajasthan Royals here on Thursday.         
	Put in to bat, the hosts overcame early blows to pile up a huge total thanks to some lusty hitting by Symonds and his 111-run fourth-wicket stand with Rohit Sharma (36).         
	Symonds hit an unbeaten 117-run knock, studded with seven sixes and 11 boundaries off 53 balls, making full use of a dropped chance at the score of 75.         
	Yousuf Pathan failed to latch on a catch off Siddharth Trivedi at point giving the Australian a chance to notch up his century in just 47-balls.         
	And he did it in style by lofting the rival skipper Shane Warne for a huge long-on six during his superb innings, which made the rival bowlers seem ordinary.         
	Paceman Munaf Patel and spin-great Warne bore the brunt of the Symondss fury as they conceded 55 and 47 runs in their quota of four overs, respectively.         
	Chargers skipper V.V.S. Laxman came to open the batting with Australian Adam Gilchrist and the duo put on 22 for the first wicket before Yousuf Pathans double strike in the third over.

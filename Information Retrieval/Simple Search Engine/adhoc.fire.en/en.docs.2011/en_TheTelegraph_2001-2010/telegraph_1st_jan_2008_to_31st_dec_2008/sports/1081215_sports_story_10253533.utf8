The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hurricane Viru strikes the visitors hard
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hurricane Viru strikes the visitors hard
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Chennai: Hurricane Viru struck this coastal city on Sunday afternoon leaving in its trail a slew of boundaries and sixes which very nearly took the wind out of Englands sails.         
	Set an imposing target of 387, Virender Sehwag blasted his way to 83 off 68 balls that left India needing another 256 on the final day with nine wickets in hand. The innings has thrown the match wide open, and as Sehwag said, they will need to bat the 90 overs on Monday in their quest to take a 1-0 lead in the RBS Cup opener.         
	England could hardly realise what hit them after declaring their innings at 311 for nine, a little after tea. There was very little Kevin Pietersen and Co. could do apart from watching the genius in Sehwag unfold at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.         
	There are men with an appetite for a fight and a sense of occasion, and then there is Sehwag. In scripting an innings of typical determination and grandeur, he provided more than his share. His body seemed alive with the challenge of the moment, enjoying the surge pressure brings.         
	In all, there were 11 boundaries and four sixes, the most riveting being an upper cut over third man off Stephen Harmison that fetched him his first six. It was sensational stuff that set alight the motley gathering after a drab and slow English progression.         
	As Sehwag used the pace of Hamison and James Anderson to his advantage, Pietersen brought in Monty Panesar as early as the sixth over. He made a mockery of all the talk about a crumbling pitch as he swung the left-arm spinner for two boundaries and a straight six.         
	Panesar decided to come over the wicket the next time, a move Sehwag thought could lead to some negative bowling. A protest from Sehwag followed discussions between the umpire and Pietersen. It didnt bring much sanity though.         
	The opening stand ended on 117 when Sehwag finally fell leg before to Graeme Swann. By then he had changed the equations that is bound to give Mahendra Singh Dhoni some relief, and Pietersen, possibly a sleepless night.         
	Sehwag manipulates the field settings. Its difficult to set fields He was exceptional, and frankly speaking, he plays the way Im not too familiar with, Andrew Strauss summed it up well.         
	Gautam Gambhir, who proved a useful foil during the mayhem at the other end, was batting on 41 along with Rahul Dravid.         
	Sehwags innings came as a big relief after much of this Test had revolved around Strauss application and concentration. The Middlesex lefthander became only the second Englishman after Graham Gooch to score hundreds in each innings against India. Paul Collingwood followed him to the landmark after lunch. But it was Englands slow run-rate that was irritating. Despite everything going in their favour, they hardly showed the willingness to go after the bowlers. Their response was restricted to pushing and prodding when a slight acceleration would have had them better placed.         
	The ease with which both Strauss (108) and Collingwood (108) batted in the morning proved that the pitch wasnt a minefield. The Indian bowlers were guilty of bowling the wrong line and length during this session that compounded to their woes.         
	Harbhajan was the worst offender, bowling short and a pre-dominantly off stump line with seven fielders on the leg side. Things became easier for the batsmen as the off-spinner was picked with ease.         
	Instead of showing positive intent, Dhoni was too defensive in his handling of the situation. The field placing meant as if India were set to lose and containment, not taking wickets, was the key.         
	It was only after lunch that Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma started bowling a much fuller length resulting in the fall of five wickets for 57 runs during the session. The 214-run fourth wicket stand ended when Harbhajan managed to lure Strauss onto the front foot and he drove straight into the hands of extra cover.         
	Andrew Flintoff, on whom England rely heavily, fell three overs later and Collingwood also departed a little later. The tail didnt last long and England declared thinking they had everything going in their favour.

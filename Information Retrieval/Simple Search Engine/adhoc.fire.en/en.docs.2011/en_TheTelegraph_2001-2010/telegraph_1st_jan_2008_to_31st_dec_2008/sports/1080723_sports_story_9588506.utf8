  - Supporters vent ire on match officials, CPT players       A STAFF REPORTER            Lal Ramluaha makes his way through the CPT defence on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan lost their first points in the Premier Division of the Sahara Calcutta Football League when they were held goalless by Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) at their home ground on Tuesday. The draw, ahead of their match against Mohammedan Sporting, is sure to put them under some pressure.         
	Mohun Bagan squandered several chances in the first session, mainly due to the ineptitude of their forwards, as CPT struggled to keep their rivals at bay. But once Jose Ramirez Barretos movements became restricted under close zonal marking and P.C. Lalawmpuiya ran out of breath, the zing was out of the attack.         
	Instead of blaming their forwards, their supporters decided to vent their ire on the rival team and the match officials at the end of the match. A senior Mohun Bagan official even alleged that the referee didnt play the full five minutes of stoppage time.         
	There is no doubt that referee Biplab Poddar erred in several decisions during the match and his inept handling of certain situations flared tempers in the galleries. But that is hardly any reason for Mohun Bagans failure to score during the 90 minutes.         
	CPT, for most part of the match, were reduced to defending in their own territory. Ayeni Bidemi Daniel and Simonta Das kept the rivals in check with some good anticipation and defending. Daniel was near invincible in the air and that blunted most of Mohun Bagans attacks. Shibram Dey and substitute Gopal Das were also near flawless under the bar.         
	Mohun Bagan rocked the CPT defence with repeated moves inside the first ten minutes. Lalawmpuiyas head rebounded into play off a defender and Barretos shot was fisted back. Odafe shot over from close range. Odafe wasted another opportunity in the middle of the first half when his powerful header kissed the crosspiece on its way out.         
	With CPT hardly going on the offensive, it became easier for Odafe and Habibur Rehman Mondal to overlap at a brisk pace. In fact, Habiburs runs down the right-flank made things tough for the CPT defence. Mohun Bagan came closest to scoring in the 50th minute when a Lal Kamal Bhowmick freekick from the far right corner was directed towards the goal in a flash by Barreto. The goalie somehow managed to put it away in the melee that ensued.         
	S. Malswamtluanga, who scored a hattrick in their last match, struggled to come to terms with the conditions. He couldnt reach the striking zone and the gameplan to play him from the deep hardly helped the team. Perhaps, Mohun Bagan need to change their strategy.

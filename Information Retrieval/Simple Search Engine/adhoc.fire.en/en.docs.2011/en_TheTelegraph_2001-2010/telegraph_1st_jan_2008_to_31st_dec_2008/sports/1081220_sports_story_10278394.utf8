The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand: Take risks to be successful
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anand: Take risks to be successful
            A STAFF REPORTER            Viswanathan Anand                           
	Calcutta: Be prepared to take risks to succeed in chess and in life, said world champion Viswanathan Anand on Friday.         
	Addressing a seminar on Strategies in tough times: Lessons from Chess through a teleconference from New Delhi, Anand emphasised on staying positive at all times.         
	Taking risks is very important. Going into a shell when nothing is going your way can be disastrous, the world champion said, referring to his experience in 2000 when he lost the first few games in a tournament in Dortmund, and looking to draw the rest, lost a few more.         
	Asked what an off-colour sportsman like Rahul Dravid should do, Anand said: Take risks. Experiment more and more. Its difficult to come out of a slump without doing something different.         
	While stressing on the benefits of taking risks, Anand said maintaining composure is also very important.         
	Bad times give us a good opportunity to take an objective look at ourselves. Its very important that we, as a nation, do not lose our composure in the wake of the terrorist attacks and the recession, he remarked.         
	While dealing with terrorism we shouldnt forget that problems like poverty, hunger and disease are still there. So we should focus on improving infrastructure. Terrorism aims to destroy our confidence. If we forget other problems in this hour of crisis, thatll be the success of terrorism. We should think about reforms that make our economy stronger so that the ups and downs of the global economy do not affect us so much in future, he added.         
	Anand also differed with the view that talent is 99 per cent perspiration and one per cent inspiration. Id say its 70 per cent inspiration. Hard work is definitely important but without natural talent, you wont get the same result, he said.         
	Terming 2008 a successful year as he won the title at Linares and also the World Championship, Anand said the future of Indian chess looks bright as players like Sasikiran and Koneru Humpy are there but Im going to be around for some more years. So dont think about the next No.1 Indian, the Grandmaster joked.         
	Talking about cricket, Anand said: Cricket has worked to become popular. Efforts are on to popularise chess in the country.

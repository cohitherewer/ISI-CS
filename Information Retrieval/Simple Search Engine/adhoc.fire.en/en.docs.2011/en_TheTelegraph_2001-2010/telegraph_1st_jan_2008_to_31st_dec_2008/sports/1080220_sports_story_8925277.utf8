The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I know my capabilities very well: Yuvraj
                                                     I know my capabilities very well: Yuvraj
  - I am not very satisfied with my knock, says vice-captain         A CORRESPONDENT            Yuvraj Singh and MoM Kumar Sangakkara at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday. (Reuters)                                 
	Adelaide: Yuvraj Singh, who returned to form with a scintillating 76 on Tuesday, hit back at critics saying every player goes through a bad time and there never was a question mark over his place in the one-day side.         
	 He also said at the news conference that he was grateful to Mahendra Singh Dhoni and others for their support.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On his performance         
	I always bat well in the nets. Its very important to go out and show what you are capable of Very happy, though, to hit the ball the way I wanted to         
	His thoughts when he walked out         
	In the last game we lost too many wickets and the run rate went up. Three wickets were down The sun was going down and it was tough light to bat in. I just tried to keep the run rate going and be positive.         
	Batting against Muralidharan         
	The last time I drove him and got out. I watched the way Gautam (Gambhir) batted against Murali in the first game and in Canberra and decided that instead of blocking, I should play my natural game. Yes, I played more shots today...         
	How he planned his innings         
	I just wanted to spend some time in the middle because the last couple of games I was struggling to do that. And I got out at 25 or 26 just when I was feeling good. I played loose shots which cost us the game. I thought that Ill take the game to an end. I should have got a hundred today... I was out to a good ball, I guess.         
	If the innings gave him satisfaction         
	I am not very satisfied with the knock Im satisfied with the way I was hitting the ball. If Dhoni wasnt there till the end we would have lost the game. Dhoni put in more effort than I did today.         
	Whether the knock has come as a relief         
	There was never a question mark over my place in the team. In the last series I had four 50s in five games. I had two bad games, and in the third game, I got just one over to bat. So after two games you are trying to put a question mark against my name in the one-day side         
	What kept him going         
	I know my capabilities And I know if I keep working towards my game, the results will be there. We all have bad times. It cant be one graph all the time. Every player has gone through this Its part and parcel of life and you just need to keep working harder. There are situations when Ive done well. When you fail in the middle its a bit disappointing. At the end of the day you are human and you want to go out there and do the best for your country. Thats what I try and do.         
	About the support he received from teammates         
	When you are playing for the team its very important that you support each other. I guess its very important to support the players because there is hardly any support from the press.         
	On Dhonis innings         
	Look at how many games he has batted like this Every time he has been consistent. I wasnt that good when I was batting lower down the order. Its tremendous how he goes in and is so consistent. Touch wood The young boys should learn from his batting in such pressure situations.         
	Seeking Sachin Tendulkars advice         
	I always spoke to Sachin about my batting since Ive started to play for India. He has been my inspiration. I always discuss with him the situation and how to go about it in the match. What Ive heard is that Ive changed my grip and you know some people are telling me about that I havent changed my grip and I dont know from where all this is coming.         
	If he had anything in mind today         
	Obviously, I just wanted to spend some time in the middle. In the last game against Australia I batted for 44 balls. My target was to bat for 50. I hit the ball well and I was confident if I start well then Ill score.         
	Indias chances of making the final         
	We cant be thinking of the final now. We need to think about the next two games. If we do well in both the games itll give us a lot of confidence in the finals. Our target is to win the next game in Sydney.         
	Whether this innings will give him confidence         
	You dont expect things to go your way all the time. But its very important that you prepare well for the game.         
	About Indias bowling         
	We had the run rate always in check. I mean 238, the bowlers have done a tremendous job. It was a good score to chase and we chased it.         
	On Virender Sehwag         
	I dont know if Viru was dropped or rested. I dont know. Just that we bowled well with five bowlers in the last game We thought lets try Praveen Kumar because even he can bat. Youve to give a chance to every one because this is a long series and you want the boys to play. Viru is a tremendous player and when he is not playing you miss him. But youve got to see the team combination also We won the game, and so I guess the combination was good.         
	Leading Mohali in the IPL         
	We are gonna bid for a couple of players and Im not going to tell you who. We have discussed what team we want and the options we have. Obviously talking to Ness Wadia and Preity Zinta we are going to discuss how the team should be done... We are going to have a chat.

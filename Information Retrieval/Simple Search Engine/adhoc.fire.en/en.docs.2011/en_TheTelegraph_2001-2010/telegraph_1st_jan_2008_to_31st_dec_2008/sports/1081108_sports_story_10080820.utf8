                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sporting keen to stay on top
                      
	Panaji: A confident Sporting Clube de Goa will go all out to garner full points when they take on Dempo on Saturday in the ONGC I-League, at the Nehru Stadium in Margao.         
	Sporting, who are at the top of the table with 15 points would like to retain the top spot.         
	Attack is the best form of defence and we will play offensively, coach Vishwas Gaonkar said.         
	Dempo are a balanced side and have one of the best midfield, Gaonkar added.         
	Meanwhile Dempo coach Armando Colaco is happy that his strikers, particularly Mboyo Iyomi, have discovered their lost touch.         
	In another match Vasco SC will lock horns with Mumbai FC at the Cooperage.

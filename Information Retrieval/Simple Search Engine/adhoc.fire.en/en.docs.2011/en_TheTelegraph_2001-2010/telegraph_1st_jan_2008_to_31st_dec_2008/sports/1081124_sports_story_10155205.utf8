            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A series of unfortunate events put paid to A1 Team Indias hopes for a podium finish in the A1GP at Sepang Sunday as the team car got booted out of both the Sprint and Feature races.         
	In the Sprint Race, as the cars came in formation towards the rolling start, an incident involving USA, Brazil and India brought out the red flag. The pack appeared to pick up pace as it approached the start line, but then backed off causing a concertina effect towards the back of the field.         
	First, the USA car of Marco Andretti and then the Brazil car of Felipe Guimares climbed over the back of Narain Karthikeyans Indian entry scattering debris across the pit straight.         
	Despite what looked like an extremely bad crash at the start, the Indian team miraculously got ready to take the grid for the afternoons Feature race, where even more excitement was expected.         
	But yet again, this time with Team Switzerland also getting off the grid early  Team India was booted out by the Netherlands car and could not finish the feature race either. Team India went into the first corner ahead of the Netherlands car that suddenly made an unexpected turn straight into Team Indias car and tore out the right rear suspension. Team Netherlands received a drive through penalty for the incident.         
	This is the first time in Narains career when he could not complete a racing lap across two consecutive sessions.         
	Neel Jani became the fifth different race winner this season as A1 Team Switzerland took victory in the Sprint race. Frances Loc Duval finished second ahead of a charging Earl Bamber for A1 Team New Zealand.

                                                     Money wont affect Manoj: Mother
            A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj Tiwary                           
	Calcutta: Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwarys mother, Bina, is very happy with her son turning out to be one of the most expensive cricketers by attracting a bid of Rs 2.7crore in the Indian Premier League players auction on Wednesday.         
	But she believes that bagging such a fortune will not distract Manoj from the game.         
	I am very happy. This is the gift of the Almighty. I never dreamt that Manoj will earn this much one day, she told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. But I know that this will not change him as a person.         
	I will, however, be happier if he scores more runs and plays more matches for the country. I pray that he gets a couple of matches more in Australia, she added.         
	Tiwary, currently in Australia as a part of the ODI squad, was included in the Delhi team  the Delhi Daredevils  along with Gautam Gambhir, Mohammed Asif.         
	There was a push by the franchisees to have young players on their rolls and one of those to have gained from this was Tiwary.         
	Tiwarys coach Manabendra Ghosh also feels the same. I know him since his childhood. He loves the game more than anything else. Whatever he has earn today is nothing but a result of his hard work, Ghosh said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     The fiasco and after
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The following is a blow by blow account of how the administration got into the act to set things right after the fiasco on April 20:         
	April 20: Kolkata Knight Riders first home match against Deccan Chargers turned out to be a flop show. A 31-minute floodlight failure, a dead electronic scoreboard and scarcity of drinking water and waterless toilets at the Eden led to chaos and mismanagement.         
	April 21: State sports minister Subhas Chakraborty blames it on the CAB saying a three-member inquiry committee would look into it.         
	April 22: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee makes a dramatic intervention to announce a broadbased probe into the fiasco. The chief minister says henceforth he will only speak on the issue. A tower of the floodlights fail again during Knight Riders practice less than 48 hours after Sundays flop show.         
	April 23: The inquiry team makes an inspection of the towers at the Eden. The preliminary diagnosis says the blackout occurred because of a violent voltage change. The CESC however dismissed the possibility. Representatives from Philips were also there during the inspection.         
	April 24: Instead of finding the reason, the inquiry committee concentrates on making sure that the next match (Tuesday) and the rest of the tournament goes off smoothly. The committees recommendations include dedicated feeder line to the towers, air conditioning the control rooms and manning by skilled personnel.         
	April 25: Tickets for the Tuesdays match disappear again. Police arrest 22 blackmarketeers.         
	April 26: Red Chillies Entertainment ask for the 48ft x 40ft dais to be removed, which will throw open 6000 more seats. CAB officials say they had been informed that the small screens were being replaced with two larger ones.         
	April 27: Cable theft at the Eden left the authorities red faced even as the police give the go-ahead for Tuesdays match. Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and a battery of senior officers and representatives of the CESC, PWD and Philips also visited the Eden. Chakrabarti said all the recommendations of the review committee were being implemented .

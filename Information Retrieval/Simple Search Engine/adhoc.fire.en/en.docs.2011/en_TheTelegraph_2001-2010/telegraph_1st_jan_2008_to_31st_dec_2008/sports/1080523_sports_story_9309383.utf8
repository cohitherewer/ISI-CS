                                                                                                                                                                                                       Paes: Im hurt by Bhupathi move
  - The whole thing has become silly and childish       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Leander Paes                                 
	New Delhi: Two days after Mahesh Bhupathi refused to team up with Leander Paes for the Beijing Olympic Games, Paes said he was extremely hurt by Bhupathis decision.         
	Paes, who chose to maintain a dignified silence for the past 48 hours, said it was time for Bhupathi to cast aside the differences and keep the interest of the country in mind.         
	The Indian Davis Cup captain turned emotional during his hour-long interaction with the media on the sidelines of a promotional and said his estranged partner was only hurting the interest of the country.         
	The whole thing has become silly and childish, Paes said. In the process, we are only hurting ourselves. At the end of day both of us are losers.         
	The seven-time Grand Slam champion said he was surprised to know that Bhupathi would prefer Rohan Bopanna as doubles partner.         
	There couldnt have been anything more ridiculous and unreasonable than this. It is no secret that we two should be the best choice for Beijing, Paes said.         
	We have seen Rohans performance in the last couple of weeks and are aware of his fitness. And even if he is completely fit, we are intelligent enough to know who is better.         
	The Calcutta and Orlando-based tennis star said he was surprised that Bhupathi chose to write to the AITA rather than communicating with him.         
	It is a very unfortunate development. Till today, Mahesh has never communicated anything to me directly. All the communication is being done through emails to the AITA, said Paes.         
	I had tried to communicate with him in the recent past but have never received any response from his side. Communication is a two way process but it was just one way in this case, said Paes.         
	The Indian captain admitted that he and Bhupathi were not always on best terms, but said that wont prevent them from doing well in Beijing.         
	We have always done well while playing for the country. You cant deny the fact that we did play together for eight years and remained World No.1.         
	Paes claimed that he and Bhupathi dont need much practice to develop the necessary understanding.         
	Both of us are playing in the ATP Tour and would be prepared enough to face any challenge in Beijing. In the 2000 Olympic Games we came together just before two months and came very close to win a medal. There was so much hue and cry about our relationship during the Doha Asian Games. We could still bag the gold for the country, he pointed out.         
	Meanwhile, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) secretary general Randhir Singh said he was keeping an eye on the development and would intervene at the right time.

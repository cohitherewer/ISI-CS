                                                                                                                                                                                                     Johnson triggers collapse
                      
	Perth: Mitchell Johnson ruined South Africa with a dramatic seven-wicket haul that included five late breakthroughs as the visitors spluttered to 243 for eight at stumps, according to Cricinfo.         
	Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers had almost put South Africa in a comfortable position when Johnson surged to career-best figures and put Australia on top during another fascinating day of cricket.         
	In an incredible finish to the day, Johnson grabbed 5/2 in 20 balls to wow his new home crowd and stun the visitors, who were happy until he arrived to deliver five venomous overs.

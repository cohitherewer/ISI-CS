                    GUEST COLUMN      Geoffrey Boycott                                  
	This is the right time for Michael Vaughan to step down as England captain and it is a sensible decision for English cricket. We all think Michael is a good leader but he cant be continually picked on captaincy alone. Every players first responsibility to the team is either to make runs or take wickets. If you cant do that then your authority diminishes, your own personal confidence ebbs away and it harms the balance of the team  something we have seen with England in recent times.         
	England would like to play five bowlers, which they did during the Test match at Headingley, but the batting is too inconsistent. That was evident at Edgbaston when they reverted to four bowlers and six batsmen. They were a lopsided unit and it was soon clear that they were a bowler short.         
	For some time now, Michaels form with the bat has been poor. Ive said it before and Ill say it again, he just doesnt make enough runs for Yorkshire, never mind England. When a Test player goes back to his county, he ought to be performing like a superstar because hes dropping down a level. But for Michael that has not been the case for four years.         
	Some of his supporters and well wishers keep reminding us of his great Ashes series in Australia in 2002-03. Im sorry, but that was five years ago and the one lesson all sportsmen have to accept is that were only as good as our last performance. Playing sport is not a nine to five job. If you want a guaranteed career, with a nice little comfort zone, then go and work in an office somewhere. We all love Michael. Hes the most personable and likeable lad you could ever meet and he has done a good job for English cricket.         
	But the bare fact is that weve been losing it for some time. England have been going nowhere. You could see it when Duncan Fletcher was in charge and even though he has gone, were still no better off. Were making the same mistakes in the batting.         
	Michael Vaughans philosophy has been to try and imitate Australia. But what he forgets is that over the last 15 years, Australia have had better individual players and been a better team than anyone else in the world. My mum could have captained them because theyve been so far ahead of every other international team.         
	Michael felt that by replicating their attacking approach to batting, it would automatically reap rewards. What has happened is that our batsmen have forgotten to play to their strengths. Everybody is different. Imitating Australia is a great form of flattery for Australians but it doesnt necessarily mean success for us. This gung-ho attitude by our batsmen means they get themselves out too often.         
	Just look at the Edgbaston Test. How many South Africans got out to bad shots and how many English batsmen did the same? Twice as many England batsmen played rash or stupid shots. Weve forgotten what you have to do as a batsman. Every individual has to find his own way to make runs. You cant just imitate the best and think it will work for you.         
	Ill take a slow hundred any time against Kevin Pietersens 13 off five balls at Headingley or when he plays brilliantly for 94 and then gives it away like he did in the last Test.         
	That one stupid mistake, which came when he had the South Africans in his pocket, could have cost us the game. If he had gone on to make 150, Michael might now be a winning captain. When Graeme Smith got the chance, he played one of the great innings. He made 154 not out and was there at the end to finish the job. No rash shots. No hubris or ego got in the way. He just wanted to win the game.         
	I take no pleasure in seeing Michael go. And I dont think anyone else should. Hes a nice lad. He has done a fine job for England. But I think the captaincy, a lack of runs and a loss of confidence have got to him in the end. Its better to go now, with dignity, than just hang on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni: We are always focused
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dhoni: We are always focused
                      
	Indore: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Sunday said his team will have to guard against complacency when they take on England in the second one-day International after thrashing the visitors by 158 runs in the series opener, Friday.         
	We are always wary of becoming complacent because if we lose then we will be criticised that we were overconfident. We are always focused on what needs to be done, the Indian skipper told reporters prior to the second match of the seven-ODI series on Monday.         
	Dhoni felt the wicket prepared for the tie at the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Associations Stadium would not match the one in Rajkot, on which the Indian batsmen feasted on the hapless England attack.         
	The wicket will not be like the one at Rajkot. There would be wear and tear as the match progresses.         
	Its dry and it would become slow and it will be difficult to score, but all these are only predictions. The toss is important, he said.         
	At Rajkot, India were asked to take first strike after England captain Kevin Pietersen, and the hosts rocketed off to a great start through their in-form openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, who made 85 and 51 respectively and also put on a century stand at almost six an over.         
	Dhoni reiterated that despite being toyed by his batsmen, Englands bowling attack was a good one and far superior when compared to what it was during their last tour of India two years ago.         
	They have a very good bowling attack. Its a much better attack than what they had when they visited two years ago, he said.         
	Meanwhile, England allrounder Paul Collingwood feels the key to bouncing back against India would be to take early wickets and put the hosts under pressure.         
	We just have to stop them. We need to be more aggressive. We want to hit India hard. The key is to take early wickets and put them under pressure, Collingwood told reporters at the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium.         
	India is very much like any other team. We did not get into a situation from where we could get on top of them. Hopefully we can do it tomorrow, he said.           (PTI)

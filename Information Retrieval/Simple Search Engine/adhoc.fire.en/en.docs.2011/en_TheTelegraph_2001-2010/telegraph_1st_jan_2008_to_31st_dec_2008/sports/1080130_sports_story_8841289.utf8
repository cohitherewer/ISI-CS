	Calcutta: Shaun Tait became the latest high-profile Australian to quit cricket on Tuesday after the fast bowler announced he was taking an indefinite break due to emotional and physical exhaustion. 
    
	Taits shock announcement came just three days after Australias vice-captain Adam Gilchrist stunned the cricket world by announcing his retirement. 
    
	Australia have been hit by a series of retirements in the past 14 months with Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Justin Langer and Damien Martyn all quitting during last seasons Ashes. 
    
	According to a Cricket Australia (CA) release, CAs Chief Medical Officer, Dr Trefor James, said: After discussions with Shaun and the South Australian Cricket Association medical staff it is clear that Shaun needs a break from cricket at all levels. Well be working with Shaun going forward to ensure that whatever assistance he requires is provided to him. Shauns personal welfare is our primary concern as well as his return to cricket at an appropriate point. 
    
	This is a very difficult situation for me to be in at this time, Tait said in a statement issued by CA. This is not an overnight decision but something that Ive been struggling with for some time. 
    
	The 24-year-old said he had lost his motivation after being hampered by injuries and struggling to cement his place in the Australian side. 
    
	Tait is one of the fastest bowlers in world cricket and was named in 2007 as the International Cricket Councils emerging player of the year. 
    
	But he has struggled to secure a place in the Australian Test team, making just three appearances in his career. 
    
	Tait said he was taking an indefinite break from the game in the hope that it would help him regain his enthusiasm. A break from professional cricket will hopefully give me a clear mind and a chance for my body to rest and recover, he said. 
    
	My love and enjoyment of the game is struggling due to these issues and if I continue to go on, it will be unfair on my teammates and support staff of both the Australian and South Australian cricket teams  and most importantly my family and close friends.

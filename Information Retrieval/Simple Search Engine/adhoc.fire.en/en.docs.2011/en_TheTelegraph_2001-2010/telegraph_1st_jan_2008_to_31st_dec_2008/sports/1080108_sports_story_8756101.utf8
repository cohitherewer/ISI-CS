	Hobart: Sania Mirza shrugged off her average outing at the Hopman Cup, starting the campaign at the $1,70,000 Moorilla Hobart International with a convincing straight-set victory over unheralded Lourdes Dominguez on Monday. 
    
	The sixth-seed Indian beat the Spaniard qualifier 6-4, 6-0 to advance to the second round of the tier IV hardcourt event. 
    
	Sania next face lucky loser Russian Alla Kudryavtseva, who beat local challenge Monique Adamczak 6-3, 6-2. 
    
	Former world number four Jelena Dokic won her first competitive match on the WTA tour in almost three years when she beat Germanys Martina Mueller 6-4, 0-6, 6-2 in the first round. 
    
	The victory, however, has created a dilemma for the 24-year-old, who was not given a wildcard for next weeks Australian Open by organisers. 
    
	The wildcard qualifying tournament for the season-opening Grand Slam begins in Melbourne on Thursday and if Dokic continues her winning form in Hobart, the Australian must decide whether or not to abandon the Tasmanian event or head to Melbourne Park. 
    
	Meanwhile in Sydney, Leander Paes had a bad day in the office as the doubles ace, in his first appearance with Australian Paul Hanley, crashed out of the $4,65,000 Medibank International. 
    
	Paes-Hanley lost to the fourth-seed Czech pair of Martin Damm  former partner of the Indian ace  and Pavel Vizner 6-7 (5-7), 4-6 in the first round. (Agencies)

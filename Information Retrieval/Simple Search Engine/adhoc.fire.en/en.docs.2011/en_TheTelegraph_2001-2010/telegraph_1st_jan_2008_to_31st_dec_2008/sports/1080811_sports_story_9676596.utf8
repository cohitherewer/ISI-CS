	London: A.B. de Villiers scored 97 on Sunday to give South Africa an outside chance of winning the fourth and final Test against England at the Oval.         
	South Africa, who have already clinched the series 2-0, were dismissed for 316 in their second innings, leaving England 197 to win their first test with Kevin Pietersen in charge.         
	England faced eight balls without adding a run or losing a wicket before rain brought the day to a premature close.         
	De Villiers and Paul Harris came together with six wickets down and South Africa only 96 ahead.         
	They played patient, composed cricket before Harris (34) fell to Stuart Broad and de Villiers missed out on his century bowled by Monty Panesar.         
	After attacking most of the match, Pietersen deployed a defensive field for De Villiers.

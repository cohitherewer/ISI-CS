The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fisichella to start 18th, Sutil 20th
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fisichella to start 18th, Sutil 20th
                      
	Manama: Giancarlo Fisichella failed to make the cut for the second qualifying session and the Force India driver will start 18th on the grid for Sundays Bahrain Grand Prix, with German teammate Adrian Sutil at 20th.         
	Fisichella (1:33.501), who posted the 12th fastest timing in Saturday mornings final practice session, was just under one-tenth of a second away from reaching the Q2 before he eventually finished behind Red Bulls David Coulthard at 18th.         
	After abandoning his previous flying lap because of an error, Fisichella gave it everything but could not avoid getting stuck in the danger zone and failing to advance to the second stage of the three-leg qualifying sessions.         
	Sutil found himself stranded in traffic and clocked 1:33.845 to finish 20th. On Sunday he will be just ahead of the two Super Aguri cars.         
	Fisichella could not hide his disappointment. Malaysia was five-hundredths away, here it was close again so it is really disappointing as we are almost there. We had a problem with the front brakes and especially with the front locking on both laps, so it is a bit disappointing. It is important to be close and try to move up in the race, he said.         
	Sutil said the circumstances were quite difficult, especially with just four minutes left after the red flag.         
	So everybody went out to do a fast lap. It was very difficult to judge the traffic and to find the space, but overall it was quite good, he said.           (PTI)

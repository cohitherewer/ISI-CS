The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferrari to review pitstop system
                                                                                                                                                                                           Ferrari to review pitstop system
                      
	London: Ferrari will review their electronic pitstop light system after a human error cost Felipe Massa dearly in Sundays Singapore Grand Prix and dealt a severe blow to the Brazilians championship hopes.         
	Massa, who started on pole, went from first to last after the pitstop blunder. He finished 13th and out of the points.         
	Team boss Stefano Domenicali explained after the race that a Ferrari mechanic had erroneously given title contender Massa the green light while the refuelling hose was still attached to the car. The overhead light signals are normally connected to the release handle on the fuel nozzle, indicating to the driver that he can leave when the hose is uncoupled.         
	However, with cars swarming into the pit lane while the safety car was deployed, Ferrari switched their light system to manual operation and the mechanics error meant the green go signal flashed prematurely.         
	We were not using the electronic system, it was run manually, Domenicali told the Ferrari website.         
	When there are a lot of cars coming into the pit in a safety car situation, it is better to have (the system working manually), he added.         
	We will analyse what we did in the other pitstops, he added.         
	Ferrari are alone using light system, with other teams using the conventional stop/go lollipops held by mechanics in front of the car. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blake joins heat chorus
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Blake joins heat chorus
            MADHUMITA GANGULY                      
	Beijing: World No. 8 James Blake is here, gunning for Olympic glory.         
	On Saturday, he practised intensively with Rafael Nadal, who is shortly to take over the mantle of the world No.1. On Sunday, the American defeated Australias Chris Gucchione 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) to move into the second round.         
	The competition was warming up when the weather played spoilsport and nine of 45 matches scheduled for Sunday were washed out.         
	It included outgoing world No. 1 Roger Federers match against Dmitry Tursunov.         
	Blake was one of the lucky few to finish his match. As he walked out of the centre court, drenched in sweat, droplets forming a puddle around his feet, he stopped to speak to The Telegraph.         
	The first question, inevitably, turned to the weather. Is the heat here bothering him a lot?         
	Not so much the heat. Its the humidity which saps a lot out of you, he said, looking down at his sweat-drenched T-shirt.         
	Maybe its good after all Ill lose pounds of water weight, he grinned.         
	World No.3 Novak Djokovic had on Saturday blasted the conditions as extreme and had asked for a 10-minute heat break, emulating the WTA which allows its players the break in extreme temperatures.         
	The International Tennis Federation chief, Ricci Bitti, has promised to look into the matter.         
	Would Blake also be in favour of such heat breaks here? Look, these decisions are for the officials to take. Not mine. But at the end of the day, Id rather it was tennis that was the deciding factor in a match than the weather.         
	And such is the condition here now that at the end of the week, the winners got to be someone whos in great shape physically.         
	The 28-year-old Blake has played in China before, in Shanghai. He has been quite overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and appreciation shown by the crowd here. He missed the Athens Olympic Games because of a traumatic phase in his life when he lost his father and suffered from injury.         
	In the absence of Andy Roddick, he hopes to keep Americas flag flying and to serve as an inspiration.         
	Of course, Im certain the Bryan brothers will bring us the doubles gold. They are the clear favourites here.         
	Talk of favourites brings us to the inevitable question of Nadal versus Federer.         
	Who in his opinion is the better player? Nadal deserves to be where he is because he has put in a lot of hard work and dedication         
	Hes had a better year certainly. But to choose between the two? Very difficult Its close, very close, Blake signed off.

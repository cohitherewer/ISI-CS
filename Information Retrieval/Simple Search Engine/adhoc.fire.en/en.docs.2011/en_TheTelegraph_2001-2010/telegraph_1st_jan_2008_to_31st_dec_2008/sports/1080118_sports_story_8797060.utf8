                                                   Aussies being paid back in own coin: Arjuna

           
	New Delhi: Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga, having been a thorn in Australias flesh during his playing days, could not hide his glee after the Sydney Test. 
    
	I think this is the first time after I gave it back that Australia are now being paid back in their own coin, an amused Ranatunga told reporters on Thursday. 
    
	Sri Lankas World Cup-winning captain said that over the last decade there have been issues with the Australian team, but he advised the Indians not to get distracted by their on-field antics and leave it to the boards of both the countries to resolve contentious matters. 
    
	Whatever happened in Sydney was unpleasant but the Indian team should not lose their focus. They should leave it to the board to sort out all these issues. 
    
	When these kind of incidents happen, I think boards should step in to make things smooth, he said. 
    
	Ranatunga once almost walked out with his team during the 1999 Adelaide Test when Muttiah Muralidharan was no-balled by umpire Darrell Hair. He, however, felt India did the right thing by continuing with the tour despite being the victims of some poor umpiring and the racism row involving Harbhajan Singh. 
    
	I dont think pulling out would have been the right thing. Im not a fan of that, though I almost did it in order to protect a colleague, he said. 
    
	The former captain said the ICC should work closely with the cricket boards to address these issues. (PTI)

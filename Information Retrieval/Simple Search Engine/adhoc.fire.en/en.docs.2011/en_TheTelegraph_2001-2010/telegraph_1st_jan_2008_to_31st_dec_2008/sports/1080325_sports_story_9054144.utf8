The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Grant critics still not satisfied 
                                                     Grant critics still not satisfied 
            OLIVER BROWN            Avram Grant                           
	Once, the expression grand slam actually denoted something significant  producing all the tricks in a game of bridge, a home run in baseball with all bases loaded, or any form of supreme sporting accomplishment. On Sunday, in a coincidence carefully confected by television, it merely signified that two sets of rather important teams were playing each other on the same afternoon.         
	In the case of Chelseas confrontation with Arsenal, the word slam did carry a certain frisson; an expectation of the physical intimidation into which this fixture has often descended. But at Stamford Bridge it was not so much the players among whom the enmities were enacted as the supporters.         
	It is taken for granted that Chelsea and Arsenal loathe each other. Their fans have turned this loathing into a grimly compelling pantomime. So it was that Ashley Cole was assailed by various ugly taunts from Arsenal diehards unforgiving of his treacherous move across London. So it was that every time Arsene Wenger dared to rise from his seat, there came a stream of vein-bulging vitriol from men in suits. And their children.         
	This is depressingly normal, of course. But after a week of sanctimonious talk about the need for discipline on the pitch, there seems little effort to impose such principles in the stands, where the price of admission is understood to confer upon fans an inviolable right to shout whatever vile abuse they choose. Most perverse of all was that the figure most abused was the man who orchestrated Chelseas comeback: their manager, Avram Grant.         
	Chelsea, creditably, had done their bit beforehand, in their programme condemning recent racist and anti-Semitic behaviour at the ground. The subtext was clear: Grants Jewishness has made him a target of the mindless minority. The club was at pains to stress that such incidents were confined to one corner of Stamford Bridge, but on Sunday the antipathy for Grant spread beyond.         
	It needed only Bacary Sagnas header, which put Arsenal ahead, for chants of You dont know what youre doing  and more damningly, Jose Mourinho  to begin. Wait a little with the knife, Grant told the media a couple of weeks ago, although really he should have been addressing Chelseas alleged supporters. Even Didier Drogbas two-goal salvo did not appease them. Weve won, but Grant has got to go, one muttered on his merry way to the exit.         
	Grant affects not to care about the barracking behind his back, and yet his perpetually hangdog look becomes more pronounced by the day. Disgracefully, he finds himself being hounded out by those who simply believe that his face does not fit. The wisdom is that he has to win one or both of the Premier League and Champions League to be spared, but the feeling grows that it would also be a victory for common decency should he prevail.

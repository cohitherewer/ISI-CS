                                                                                                                                                                                                     Day I highlights
                      
	 India are playing their third Test match on the P. Sara ground. Only Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble have played a Test on this ground before.         
	 Parthiv Patel made a comeback in Test cricket after 3 years and 284 days. His last Test was against Australia at Nagpur in October 2004. Parthiv had also made his Test debut on August 8 (2002) vs England at Nottingham.         
	 Tendulkar played his 150th Test match. He is only the third international cricketer to achieve the feat after Steve Waugh (168) and Alan Border (156).         
	 Sourav Ganguly, when on 21, completed 4000 runs in away matches. He became the 18th player overall and fourth Indian after Tendulkar (6807), Rahul Dravid (6025) and Sunil Gavaskar (5055) to do so.         
	 Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir posted their third consecutive 50-run partnership.         
	 When Sehwag was dismissed by Dammika Prasad, it became the second time in his career that Sehwag became a debutant bowlers first wicket. In 2003-04, Australian Nathan Bracken got Sehwag out as his first Test victim at Brisbane.         
	 Gambhir scored his third consecutive fifty and his sixth in Tests so far. It was his third vs Sri Lanka.         
	 When he claimed the wicket of Gambhir, Ajantha Mendis claimed the 19th wicket of this series. He now holds the record of most wickets claimed by any Sri Lankan in their debut series. The previous record of 18 wickets (1985-86) was held by Saliya Ahangama, who coincidentally also achieved the feat against India.         
	 When on 34, the 10th-wicket partnership of Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma equalled the previous best 10th-wicket partnership on this ground. Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini had put on 34 for the 10th wicket at this venue in 2006.         
	 When on 35, the pair equalled the previous-best 10th-wicket partnership for India on Sri Lankan soil. Ishant had accompanied V.V.S. Laxman to put on 35 at the Colombo SSC.         
	 When Zaheer and Ishant added 50 runs for the 10th wicket, the pair brought up the seventh 50-run partnership for the 10th wicket on Sri Lankan soil.         
	 Mendis claimed his second five-wicket haul. It may be recalled that his first came in the second Test at Galle.

	Perth: For one who has received so much flak in recent days, Ricky Ponting looked quite composed during his Q amp;A session with the media on Tuesday. Later, he briefly spoke to The Telegraph too.
 
	The following are excerpts
 
	On the importance of the third Test, beginning on Wednesday
 
	Its important for a number of reasons hellip; We want to win and break the world record but its really important that the game is played in the right spirit hellip; Theres been a lot of talk in the media and probably around the public as well over the past week or so about the last Test (at the SCG) and the way it was played hellip; There was some truth, but a lot was blown out of proportion hellip; The other day (Sunday), our team spoke about some minor issues and the areas we could brush up on hellip; We had a look at some of the (SCG) replays as it was important to take it upon us as individuals to make sure that we did things better the next time hellip; I hope the crowds enjoy the spectacle well be putting on.
 
	On the responsibility which rests on his and Anil Kumbles shoulders
 
	We had a real open discussion in Ranjan Madugalles presence yesterday (Monday) hellip; One thing that came out is that were happy to leave everything that happened last week behind us hellip; By withdrawing their charge against (Brad) Hogg, the Indians have shown they want to move on hellip; Between us, as captains, weve resolved any angst there might have been between players hellip; I dont think there was any, though hellip; Weve decided to move on and realised that the game of cricket is bigger than just us hellip;
 
	On whether it was necessary for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to send Chief Match Referee Madugalle to act as peacemaker
 
	Look I think it was a good initiative from the ICC hellip; Anil and I couldve got together without him being there, but he got assigned as the mediator hellip; It has worked out pretty well.
 
	On whether any bad blood still remains
 
	Not that I know of hellip; If there was, I and my players would go out of our way to make sure nothing spilled over and that it got resolved. Anil promised there wasnt and I said the same thing. Youll see this Test being played in terrific spirit, the kind seen at the MCG and for a majority of the SCG Test hellip;
 
	On whether Australia could make a similar gesture on the Harbhajan Singh front, even though his case is in the appeals stage
 
	To tell the truth, we havent spoken about it hellip; Its only last evening that the charge against Hogg got withdrawn hellip; The hearing (of Harbhajans appeal) is after the Test series and, so, there will be some time for the hierarchy to sit back and discuss hellip; At this stage, I cant comment.
 
	On whether hes been hurt by the reaction across Australia after the SCG Test
 
	Dont really know what the fans have had to say, weve only been reading what has been written by certain reporters hellip; I havent been listening to the radio and its probably been a good idea for me not to hellip; I think Cricket Australia has been made aware by sections of the public that they might have had an issue with the way we played at the SCG hellip; More importantly, however, its up to us players to reflect on how we played... That was the whole idea of our team meeting the other day hellip; Of being as honest as we could be with ourselves hellip; Weve talked about getting it right this time. (Adds laughing) The opinion was one way last week and seems to have turned in the last couple of days hellip; The games upon us now and were excited about it. If were good enough, hopefully, the record is around the corner.
 
	On whether the past week or so has been his toughest period as captain
 
	Not sure about it hellip; But, yes, it was tough after losing the Ashes (in England, in 2005) hellip; The Australians arent used to losing and, so, that was a difficult period to deal with. (After a pause) Lots of challenges come up when youre a leader hellip; It could be in business, could be in sport hellip; This period has been a challenge but the way this Australian team and I have been able to deal with it has been excellent. Both Anil and I were under a lot of pressure and its good that we could sit down as men and have a chat about the whole thing hellip; It has certainly been good for the game hellip;
 
	On the Australia XI
 
	Matthew Haydens not fit, so Chris Rogers will make his debut hellip; Its going to be a terrific achievement hellip; Hes been waiting in the wings and its a good thing that hell be making his debut on home ground hellip; Walking out on your park gives great thrill hellip; Hes got form under his belt and is over the moon hellip; Its a great opportunity for him hellip; Weve also opted for Shaun Tait, wholl be playing instead of Hogg hellip; He was feeling a bit tight after yesterday, but felt fine after this mornings work out. Hes at 100 per cent. As captain, its exciting to have someone like him.
 
	On just how close was Hayden to playing his 87th consecutive Test
 
	He was close hellip; We had quite a long discussion out in the middle (after Tuesdays optional training) hellip; He felt hed gone from 50 per cent to about 70-80, but with things happening in the last Test, where he needed a runner in the second innings, we decided not to take a chance hellip; A few thoughts came up hellip; Matthew will have this week off and should recover by the Adelaide Test (from January 24).
 
	On Rogers
 
	Havent seen much of him in person, to tell the truth hellip; But hes been impressive and deserves this opportunity. Hope he sleeps well tonight and makes some runs in front of his home crowd.
 
	On whether Australia aim to rattle Team India with an all-pace attack
 
	We can, yes hellip; Weve got a good balance and a good mix hellip; Tait and (Brett) Lee will be our impact bowlers hellip; However, I wont be surprised if Stuart Clark has the most success.
 
	On whether Andrew Symondss and Michael Clarkes performance as part-time spinners at the SCG influenced the composition of the attack
 
	Not really hellip; Weve been influenced by the conditions and do know weve got an adequate back-up for spin.
 
	On whether the fiery Tait will open with Lee
 
	I think too much is made of bowling bouncers and so on in Perth hellip; This wicket, more so than many, does reward landing the ball in the right areas hellip; Tait will be used in short spells to unsettle the batsmen hellip; Its very rare for him to go through an innings without two-three wickets. Brett too could be used in short bursts hellip; Having four quicks gives options.
 
	On the Waca wicket
 
	It has a bit of grass and all indications are that its getting back to the Waca of old hellip; Lots of pace and lots of bounce hellip; It will do quite a bit for the first couple of days hellip;
 
	On whether hell be tempted to bowl first, assuming he has the choice
 
	Theres an opportunity for that hellip; However, I dont make too much of the wicket too far out from a game hellip; Ill have a look at it again tomorrow and lean on the West Australians in the team for inputs hellip; Whether we bowl or bat first, weve got the bowlers to do the work.
 
	On former captain Mark Taylors session with Symonds during the optional nets
 
	With Matt not playing, Symonds has to be in the slips cordon and Mark, who was himself brilliant there, was having a chat with him. It was about technique refinement hellip; Im sure Symonds picked up a few little things along the way.
 
	On the likelihood of Virender Sehwag opening with Wasim Jaffer
 
	(Grins) Actually, Id thought hed play the last Test (at the SCG) hellip; He scored a hundred in Canberra and his inclusion will take some of the pressure off Rahul Dravid hellip; In the last couple of days, weve had a bit of a think about the likely composition hellip; Well be ready for whatever team is put on the park hellip; Our bowlers will be prepared for Sehwag or whoever hellip; We know Sehwags strengths and weaknesses and, if he does play, then hopefully well keep him under control.
 
	[A couple of hours later, it got confirmed that Sehwag would indeed play.]
 
	On the pre-series agreement on low catches
 
	Its been scrapped hellip; Thats not what I wanted, but the feeling in the Indian team mdash; not necessarily Anils mdash; was that the umpires should decide hellip;
 
	Finally, on whether wife Rianna, who was upset after the SCG Test, too is relieved
 
	(Laughs) Well, yes hellip; I spoke to her last evening (after meeting Kumble in Madugalles presence). Shes fine.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chris Gayle returns
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chris Gayle returns
                      
	Bridgetown: West Indies captain Chris Gayle will return to the side for the third Test against Australia which starts on Thursday.         
	Gayle missed the first two Tests, in Jamaica and Antigua, due to a groin injury which has kept him out of action for nearly two months.         
	I am at 90 per cent but I will be able to cope and will definitely play, Gayle told a news conference after practice on Wednesday.         
	The left-hander will retake the reigns of the side from vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan and will likely open with Xavier Marshall.         
	Australia lead 1-0 ahead of the third and final Test.           (REUTERS)

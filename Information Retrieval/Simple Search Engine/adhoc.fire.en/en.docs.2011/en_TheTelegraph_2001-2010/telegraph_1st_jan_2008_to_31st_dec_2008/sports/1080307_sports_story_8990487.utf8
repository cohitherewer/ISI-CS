The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time for Sania to go after the top ten

	Sania is knocking on the door of the top ten. A close match with Venus Williams in the Australian Open and her recent encounter against Jelena Jankovic, world No. 4 at Dubai when she was just a point away from a 5-3 lead in the deciding set signal a significant improvement in her game. In particular, Sanias match against Jankovic is indicative of the progress she has made. Jankovic is a tenacious fleet footed grinder with a very low percentage of unforced errors. You have to play well and hit winners to beat her. There are no gift points.         
	In sharp contrast is Venus, who is of a higher class but error prone in patches. A good score against Venus can be misleading. In one of her recent matches in the Gulf which Venus lost, she is reported to have made as many as 44 unforced errors.         
	Now is the time for Sania to strike at the top ten. Most of the players in the top ten now wary of playing against her. A factor not to be taken lightly. A victory over any of the top ten will boost her confidence and take her game to a higher level. Confidence is the difference between the champion and the chasers.                 
	Sanias brittle fitness is a major concern. Injury lay-offs have taken a heavy toll on her rankings and have halted her progress. Her physical training should be reviewed very carefully and she should seek advise from the very best in the world.         
	I remember Sebastian Coe telling me that his father had cut down his training to half of the prevailing norm the year he won two golds in the Olympics. Perhaps a slow down in her training schedules should be considered and a long term physical training programme mapped out.         
	Records show that in most cases Grand Slam winners take 4-5 years after the junior ranks to mature fully. Pulling out from the womens doubles events would reduce her workload and make her less vulnerable to injuries.         
	Sanias refusal to play in the Bangalore tournament is tragic. In top form and injury free she has thrown away a chance to take on the Williams sisters who are nowhere near their best. On home ground with a hysterically supportive crowd, Sania had a fair chance to win the tournament and achieve a major breakthrough in her career. If you do not grab your chances in life, luck will pass you by. Vijay Amritraj described it as a golden opportunity which would have helped Sania gain crucial ranking points.         
	There seems to be more to the boycott by Sanias than meets the eye. The so-called unbearable happenings which are supposed to have triggered her decision not to play in India are unavoidable niggles in a stars life. They seem to be insignificant compared to what some of our cricketing stars have been put through. By such standards perhaps no cricketing icon would be playing in India.         
	Sania, believe me, is as strong as any of our other icons and can easily take whatever little has happened in her stride. The rumours are that the tournament sponsors and Sanias agents could not come to terms. There is absolutely nothing wrong for professionals to seek better terms, because it is their profession. The failure to resolve the issue amicably has been a blow to Sanias career and to tennis in India.         
	It projects a very poor view of our country, which will be carried by the players all over the globe.         
	The enterprising tournament organisers have managed to rope in 6 of the top 20 players. Three of them are in the top ten. It has become the biggest womens event in South Asia.         
	Statements made by the organisers that Sanias absence hardly makes any impact and tickets have been sold out for the last two days are full of rancour. One hopes that Sania and Indian tennis do not suffer any more due to what seems to be an obvious clash of egos.         
	The oft-repeated clich of no one is bigger than the game endorsed by Vijay Amritraj and Leander Paes, sums it all up.

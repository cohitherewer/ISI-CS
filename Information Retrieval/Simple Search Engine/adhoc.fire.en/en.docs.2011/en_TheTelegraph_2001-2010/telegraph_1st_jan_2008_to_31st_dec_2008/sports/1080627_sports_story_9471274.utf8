                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lippi at the helm again
                      
	Rome: World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi has taken charge of the Italy team again in place of Roberto Donadoni, the Italian Soccer Federation (FIGC) said on Thursday.         
	Marcello Lippi returns to the helm of the national team, an FIGC statement said.         
	Donadoni was told at a meeting with FIGC president Giancarlo Abete earlier on Thursday that he was no longer wanted after the world champions Euro 2008 quarter final defeat by Spain.         
	Donadoni had signed a two-year contract extension before Euro 2008, but the deal included an escape clause on both sides that could be put into effect within 10 days of Italys loss. He had guided Italy to 13 wins, five draws and five losses.         
	President Abete met national team coach Roberto Donadoni at the federation headquarters and an assessment was made for the last two years, and for the outcome of the European Championship, the federation said in a statement on its website.         
	Barcelonas confession         
	Barcelona: FC Barcelona is interested in signing Russias European Championship star Andrei Arshavin.         
	Barcelona vice president Ferran Soriano said that the Catalan club has been following the Russia playmakers progress for several months now. We are interested in Arshavin, a Barcelona newspaper quoted Soriano as saying on Thursday. But our interest isnt sudden since we have been following him with discretion for a few months now.         
	Violent fans arrested         
	Basel: Basel police detained 21 violent football fans after Germanys 3-2 win over Turkey at the European Championship semi-final on Wednesday.         
	The fans were taken into temporary police custody for fighting with other fans, police said Thursday, adding that there were no major incidents. About 50,000 people followed the match in Basels fan zones, organisers said.         
	Recber retires         
	Basel: Turkey goalkeeper Rustu Recber has announced his international retirement following Wednesdays 3-2 defeat by Germany in the Euro 2008 semi-finals.         
	The match in Basel, which the Turks were unlucky to lose, was his 118th final cap.

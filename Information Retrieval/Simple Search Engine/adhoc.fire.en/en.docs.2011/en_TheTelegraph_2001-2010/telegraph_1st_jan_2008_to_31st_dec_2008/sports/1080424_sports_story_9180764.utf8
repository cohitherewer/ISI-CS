The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers look for change in fortunes 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chargers look for change in fortunes 
                      
	Hyderabad: A beleaguered Deccan Chargers would look for a much-needed victory when they take on a resurgent Rajasthan Royals in their third IPL encounter at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Thursday.         
	The Chargers had received a drubbing at the hands of Kolkata Knight Riders in their first match at the Eden on Sunday. However, with big guns like Adam Gilchrist, Andrew Symonds, Shahid Afridi and skipper V.V.S. Laxman himself coming cropper they went down to Delhi DareDevils in their second match on Tuesday         
	Laxman will be under immense pressure to deliver on Thursday as he has failed to show his mettle in the shortest format of the game. Other star players in the team are also likely to come under scrutiny over their performance.         
	Meanwhile, Rajasthan Royals who lost their first match to Delhi DareDevils on Saturday, are on a high after their impressive win against Kings XI Punjab in their second match.         
	With spin legend Shane Warne weaving his magic along with allrounder Shane Watson and young Ravindra Jadeja coming up with brilliant performances with the bat, the Jaipur team holds a psychological advantage over their opponent.         
	Watson scored a brisk 76 including five sixes in 49 balls against the Punjab team.         
	However, Mohammed Kaifs form is a bit a worry for captain and coach Warne. Kaif fell cheaply in the last two matches scoring nine and five and he will have to fire to cut down the workload on Watson and other youngsters.         
	After their nine-wicket loss to Delhi DareDevils, Warne said that he would want Kaif and Munaf Patel to play a big role in the teams fortunes in the Twenty20 competition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaibs 5-year ban is suspended for a month
                                                                                                                                                                                           Shoaibs 5-year ban is suspended for a month
    - A great relief as I am keen to play in the IPL, says Pakistan pacer                             
	Karachi: The appellate tribunal of the Pakistan Cricket Board on Sunday decided to suspend the five-year ban on Shoaib Akhtar for a month, paving the way for his participation in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The appellate tribunal granted the temporary relief after Shoaib and his lawyers moved an urgent application on Saturday that the ban be suspended so that he can earn his livelihood by participating in the IPL.         
	Shoaib argued before the three-member panel that it would take a long time for the tribunal to reach a verdict on his regular appeal against the ban and therefore he should not be made to suffer for that duration.         
	The tribunal had refused to stay the ban earlier this week but had allowed the fast bowler to play anywhere outside Pakistan.         
	But the governing council of the IPL barred him from the tournament, saying he would not be allowed until the ban is lifted.         
	Shoaib was bought by the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders for $ 425,000 in the players auction.         
	Justice (retd) Aftab Farrukh, who heads the tribunal, told reporters that the ban would remain suspended until the regular hearing starts into the appeal filed by Shoaib from June 4.         
	Since it will take time to dispose of Shoaibs regular appeal against the ban the tribunal felt that preventing him from playing in the league would have been an additional penalty on him, Farrukh said.         
	It would have been an additional penalty which has not even been prescribed by the disciplinary committee of the board which banned him from playing in or for Pakistan but not outside Pakistan.         
	He made it clear that the ban would be reinforced from June 4 when the hearing re-starts.         
	This is a great relief as I am keen to play in the IPL. But this is just one battle won and we still have to win the final case, Shoaib said after the hearing at the National Cricket Academy.         
	It is a big relief but my eventual aim remains to be cleared of the ban and play for my country, he added.         
	Shoaib has not played any competitive cricket apart from one first-class match in late February after which he was banned.         
	He was not selected for the home one-day series against Zimbabwe and was under ban when Bangladesh played in April.         
	Meanwhile in New Delhi (IPL) chairman Lalit Modi welcomed Shoaib Akhtar in the ongoing Twenty20 tournament         
	Our condition (to allow him play in IPL) was that the ban must be lifted or suspended. In that effect, Shoaib is now allowed to play in the IPL. Weve spoken to him and he should be coming to India within the next two days, Modi told a television channel.         
	He has got a huge fan base in India and the Knight Riders are extremely happy.         
	Shah Rukh wanted Shoaib to come for one day at least. We are glad that Shoaib can now play for him, Modi said.         
	Hes free to play from the next match but that would depend on when he gets here. The trainer and physio will check him, the coach would go through the process. So whether he plays the next match or not is for the Knight Riders to decide, Modi said.           (PTI)

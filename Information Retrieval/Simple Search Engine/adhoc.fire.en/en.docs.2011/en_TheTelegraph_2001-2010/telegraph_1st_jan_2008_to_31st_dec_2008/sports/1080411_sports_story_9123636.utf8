                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pressure will be on them, says Smith
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kanpur: After leading his team to South Africas biggest-ever win over India in Ahmedabad, Graeme Smith wants to wrap up the series 2-0 at the Green Park Stadium. A victory would make the 27-year-old surpass the late Hansie Cronje as South Africas most successful Test captain. At a news conference on Thursday, Smith said his teammates are keen on continuing an aggressive brand of cricket.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Preparations for the third Test         
	Its all about maintaining our focus, executing our plans and hopefully adapt to the wicket. I am sure we are the better-prepared team going into the Test.         
	Whether there will be more than one spinner         
	We have two spinners in our squad. We will obviously look at this option but the final decision will be taken on Friday.         
	On the game plan         
	Our plans worked out in the last two matches and we hope it works out here as well We will continue to play the same brand of cricket.         
	Pressure on his team         
	I think we are definitely more confident going into this Test. We are the team under less pressure. India are the ones with more question marks in terms of selection, injuries and being 0-1 down. For us, the main thing is about maintaining the standard that we have produced throughout the season.         
	On the grass-less wicket         
	I think the track opens up more possibilities for all bowlers. Thats encouraging. We have got more variety, more pace and our bowlers have done a pretty good job. We have played a lot more determined cricket and that has shown in our intensity on the field.

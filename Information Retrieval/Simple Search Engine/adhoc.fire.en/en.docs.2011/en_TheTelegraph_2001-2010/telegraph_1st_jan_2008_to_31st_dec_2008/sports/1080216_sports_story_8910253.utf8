                                                   Gunners down to bare bones for United clash
  - Ferguson urges players to draw on Busby Babes fighting spirit                           Cristiano Ronaldo		              Emmanuel Adebayor		      
	London: Injury-plagued Arsenal are down to the bare bones ahead of the FA Cup fifth-round clash against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday, manager Arsene Wenger said.         
	Wenger, who will make a late decision on his starting line-up, said on Friday only 14 players were to travel north for the weekends outstanding tie.         
	But he rejected all thoughts of fielding a weakened team to save his senior men for next Wednesdays Champions League clash with AC Milan.         
	It is a priority (this game) because it is the next game and we want to keep our good run going and we want to try to win the trophy, Wenger told reporters. I am down to the bare bones of just 14 players so everybody travels.         
	It will be a late decision tomorrow morning to see who I may give a breather to. So, tonight I will check the medical people.         
	Wenger said he was doubtful about the fitness of defenders Gael Clichy and Philippe Senderos, striker Emmanuel Adebayor and midfielder Matthieu Flamini with various joint and muscle problems.         
	Arsenal lead the Premier League by five points and have lost just once in their last 16 outings, a League Cup defeat at Tottenham last month. Arsenal are also unbeaten in their last three meetings against Manchester United.         
	Wenger said he was definitely without midfielder Tomas Rosicky, forwards Theo Walcott, Robin van Persie, midfielders Bacary Sagna and Denilson.         
	He said Jens Lehmann would continue in goal and that he would select the best available side for the game.         
	Manchester United are boosted by the return to fitness of forward Louis Saha, who has been sidelined with a cartilage problem.         
	Saha has trained all week and is available, United manager Alex Ferguson told reporters.         
	Ferguson hopes his side can rebound quickly from the emotional toll of the Munich disaster commemorations, calling on his players to replicate the fighting spirit shown by the Busby Babes in 1958.         
	Instead of providing an motivational boost, the ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of the Munich air crash that killed 23 people  including eight United players  seemed to weigh heavily on Fergusons team during Sundays 1-2 defeat to crosstown rivals Manchester City.         
	I have a feeling the emotions got to our players, Ferguson said. The minutes silence was very, very emotional I thought. In fact it got to me, thats the only thing I can offer, because it was certainly was the worst the performance you would expect of Manchester United.         
	It has been a quiet training field this week. There has been a deep impact on the team and they have felt it. Hopefully it will work for us.         
	They are genuine players and they have a genuine desire to do better. It is an uphill fight for us to win the league now, but it is certainly not beyond them. It is a good test, Ferguson maintained.   
	key men

	Cristiano Ronaldo  
	On current form Cristiano Ronaldo can challenge any of the legends who have graced the Manchester United history. The Portuguese star has been in scintillating form this season, scoring 27 goals and creating countless more as he rapidly closes in on the 32-goal mark set by George Best in 1967-68. A two-footed and highly skillful player, he has developed a wide array of skills that leaves his opponents confused. Manchester City manager Sven-Goran Eriksson recently said: ldquo;There is no trick to beating United. Just stop Ronaldo from playing. rdquo;  
	Ryan Giggs  
	Manchester United rsquo;s longest serving current   player, Giggs made his first appearance for the Red Devils in 1991-92 season and has already made more than 700 appearances. Regarded   a genius, he is one of the greatest left wingers   in the current generation. Giggs, 35, may have lost a bit of pace but he is a man of terrific all-round abilities. A fantastic dribbler and passer, he can still score goals, has immense experience and knows his teammates inside out. Giggs has also been playing great football as a central midfield support to striker Wayne Rooney.  
	Arsenal  
	Emmanuel Adebayor  
	The Togolese striker rsquo;s greatest contribution   for Arsenal is that he has proved to be an able replacement for Thierry Henry. A big match player, Adebayor has the knack of scoring in crucial matches. He has scored 19 goals in 24 games in the Premier League this season and this is the main reason why the Gunners are currently sitting on top of the table, ahead of   Manchester United. Adebayor rsquo;s contribution to the side can not be measured solely in how many goals he has scored. His pace and   willingness to chase down defenders can   create countless openings for his colleagues.  
	Cesc Fabregas  
	Cesc Fabregas is one of the most   improved midfielders in the English circuit and could be a key factor in the Arsenal game plan. Great in tackle and blessed with wonderful technique and vision, the young Spaniard is going through a fine season since joining the club five years ago.  According to latest reports, the young Spaniard has opened negotiations with   Arsenal that might lead to a huge increase   in his salary. He is currently earning around pound;50,000 a week. Now, he may be paid pound;80,000 a week and a contract until 2016.

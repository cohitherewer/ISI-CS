The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No proper guidance, says Taibu
                                                                                                                                                                                                     No proper guidance, says Taibu
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu believes that lack of proper guidance in the countrys domestic circuit has affected the game and the younger generation have lost interest in the sport.         
	The young cricketers in Zimbabwe dont get proper guidance. Its because of lack of planning, Taibu told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening.         
	According to the 24-year old Zimbabwe wicketkeeper, its the duty of the senior cricketers to come forward and help out the talented youngsters.         
	Most of the older cricketers dont retire and the young players hardly get any scope. Even they dont come up and share their experience which will be of great help, he added.         
	Asked why Zimbabwe have failed to raise their game, Taibu said: We have the situation where we are trying to rebuild and rebuild and rebuild but its not coming worthy.         
	Taibu, who is playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the ongoing IPL, is planning to set up an indoor cricket academy in Harare. If everything goes accordingly, it will start operating soon, Taibu said.

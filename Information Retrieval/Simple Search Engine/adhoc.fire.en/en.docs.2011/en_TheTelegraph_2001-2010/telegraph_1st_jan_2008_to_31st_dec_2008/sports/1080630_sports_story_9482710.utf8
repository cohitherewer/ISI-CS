The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Loew comes of age
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Loew comes of age
                      
	Vienna: Joachim Loew has stepped out of Juergen Klinsmanns shadow at Euro 2008, while showing a daring streak in his character to match the teams adventurous style.         
	Germany made it to the final against Spain after Loew tore up his carefully conceived plan after just three games, switching his formation from the tried and trusted 4-4-2 to a more flexible 4-5-1.         
	Loews Plan B finally got the best out of captain Michael Ballack in the quarter-final against Portugal.         
	Loew, a softly spoken coach, was a surprise choice when Klinsmann plucked him from obscurity to make him his right-hand-man in 2004. He had enjoyed one good spell in charge of VfB Stuttgart, winning the German Cup and reaching the final of the European Cup Winners Cup, but he was hardly a household name.         
	The double-act proved successful. Loew took care of training while Klinsmann did the inspirational speeches, and he was the only candidate to take over after the head coach decided to call it quits following a third-placed finish at the 2006 World Cup.         
	The big question was how he would measure up not so much on tactics and team selection but in motivation and leadership. Germans need not have worried.         
	Under Loew, the team qualified for Euro 2008 easily and also made it to the final, and he can celebrate a major tournament success at his first attempt.         
	I think weve been very consistent over the past two years, Loew said at a news conference this week. Now its about keeping the players grounded.           (REUTERS)

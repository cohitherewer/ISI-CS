The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hand of God still irks Butcher
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hand of God still irks Butcher
                      
	London: Former England defender Terry Butcher said he could not forgive Diego Maradona for his Hand of God goal as the two old foes prepared to meet again 22 years after the infamous incident.         
	Butcher, now Scotlands assistant coach, still retains a burning sense of injustice over the goal that knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup finals in Mexico.         
	Maradona takes charge of the Argentine national team for the first time in a friendly against Scotland at Hampden Park on Wednesday.         
	Ill never forgive him. Its not nice to lose a World Cup quarter final under those circumstances, but that was 22 years ago and this isnt about that game, Butcher said.         
	It is very interesting, very intriguing. But this is all about Scotland playing Argentina.         
	Butcher was among the array of bemused England defenders left trailing in Maradonas wake that day for the Argentines second goal, widely regarded as one of the best ever scored.         
	But despite the bitter memory of Maradonas first goal in Argentinas 2-1 victory, Butcher thinks the South American nation have made a wise choice and that Maradona could have a similar impact to Jurgen Klinsmann when he was given the Germany job.         
	He was the best player Ive played against but, for me, Pele was the best I have seen, said Butcher.         
	But to have somebody like Maradona coaching the national team, then that is fantastic for the Argentina players.         
	Players do hold him in high regard and they will be keen to impress their new boss and their idol. It will probably work against Scotland on Wednesday.         
	It is an excellent appointment for Argentina. It provides a focal point for the players, look at (Marco) Van Basten for Holland or (Jurgen) Klinsmann for Germany.         
	I think it does galvanise you if you are being selected by the best player your country has ever produced.           (REUTERS)

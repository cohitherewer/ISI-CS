The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dutch masters remain dominant
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dutch masters remain dominant
            Jeremy Wilson in Berne                            
	The build-up had been dominated by Italian concerns about the result being arranged. The aftermath, though, will simply focus on this rather ominous demonstration of Dutch strength.         
	Holland certainly dismissed any doubts about their integrity by first outplaying and then eliminating Romania. Second-half goals from Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Robin van Persie sealed this victory but, in truth, the scoreline was flattering to Romania (as briefly reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). For Holland, it is nine goals and nine points after a hugely impressive opening phase to the tournament.         
	Coach Marco van Basten had promised to field his best available team, though a cold shiver would probably have gone down the spines of both sets of players in the dressing rooms at the Letzigrund in Zurich when team news emerged from Bern.         
	Predictably, Holland were virtually unrecognisable from the side which defeated France 4-1 last Friday with Khalid Boulahrouz and Orlando Engelaar the only survivors from that starting line-up.         
	The Dutch have the luxury of being able to replace quality with quality and it was also a chance for players like Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Klaas Jan Huntelaar to impress ahead of Saturdays quarter final against either Sweden or Russia.

	Hamilton: Jamie How fell agonisingly short of his first century while New Zealand threw away a golden opportunity to seize control of the first Test against England at the end of Day I on Wednesday.         
	How, whose previous highest Test score was 37, was dismissed for 92 in the final session at Seddon Park when he was caught by Paul Collingwood off Monty Panesar before New Zealand ended the day on 282 for six.         
	Ross Taylor will resume on Thursday on 54 with captain Daniel Vettori on four. Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum had produced a dashing 51 off 55 balls before he was dismissed in the penultimate over of the day.         
	He and Taylor had combined for an 86-run partnership after New Zealand looked to have squandered their chance to build a big first innings when they lurched to 191 for five.         
	All five of the England bowlers took a wicket each with Sidebottom the pick of the attack with two for 39 off 21 overs.         
	I think everyone realises that (the game) is still in the balance, How said. We probably lost a couple more wickets than we would have liked.         
	I think its a big part of the game tomorrow (Thursday). That first hour will be very important in how we bat and how we push on to a bigger score.         
	Despite Hows composed innings and the partnership between Taylor and McCullum, New Zealand should have capitalised more on the benign pitch in ideal batting conditions after Vettori had won the toss and chosen to bat.         
	It was a good comeback, said England coach Peter Moores.         
	At tea we knew if we could get wickets three and have them six down at the end of play would have been satisfying.         
	New Zealands run accumulation was stymied by brilliant catches from the England fielders just as they were beginning to build partnerships.         
	Alastair Cook produced two spectacular catches at gully, with his one-handed diving effort at full stretch to dismiss Stephen Fleming for 41 off Sidebottom after lunch the highlight of the display.         
	He produced a similar effort to catch the dangerous Jacob Oram for 10 during the final session, while he also took a sharp chance to dismiss Matthew Bell for 19 in the first session.

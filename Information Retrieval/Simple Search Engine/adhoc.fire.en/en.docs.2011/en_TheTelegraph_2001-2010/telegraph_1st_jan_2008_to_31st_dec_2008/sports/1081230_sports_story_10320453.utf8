The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke cant explain Ricky tactics
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Clarke cant explain Ricky tactics
                      
	Melbourne: The Australian cricket team is in disarray and the struggling sides woes became quite apparent when vice-captain Michael Clarke said he cannot explain the logic behind some tactical decisions taken by skipper Ricky Ponting during the ongoing Test series against South Africa.         
	The Proteas are on the verge of humilliating the Aussies in their own backyard by winning the three-Test series and as the world champions grapple to explain their astonishing slump, it seems the communication among the players is breaking down.         
	At the end of the third days play on Sunday, Clarke was asked why allrounder Andrew Symonds was not introduced into the bowling attack until the 125th over of South Africas first innings, his reply was a stunning: I have no idea. I guess youd probably have to ask Ricky that.         
	Asked why Simon Katichs wrist spin was not used against the South African tail-enders, who went on to add 275 runs to the total, Clarke again shirked: ... probably another question for the skip. I dont make the bowling changes.         
	Meanwhile, South Africas Jean-Paul Duminy, the batsman who turned the Melbourne Test on its head, expects to be left out of the playing XI for the December 3-7 third Test in Sydney.         
	Duminy replaced injured Ashwell Prince, and expects to lose his spot when Prince is fit. It probably will happen. If Ashwell is fit to play, I am sure he will play, but I am thankful for the opportunity. I have got a taste of Test cricket now, so I am just looking forward to my next game, he said.

	Knoxville (Tennessee): Arjun Atwal turned in a bogey-free four-under 68 in the penultimate round to hold on the tied sixth spot in the $500,000 Knoxville Open on the Nationwide Tour.         
	With a total of 13-under 204, the Orlando-based golfer trails leader Australian Jarrod Lyle (67) by four strokes.         
	Atwal, who led the field after the opening round, was in sublime form Saturday and was off the blocks with a birdie on the first hole. (PTI)

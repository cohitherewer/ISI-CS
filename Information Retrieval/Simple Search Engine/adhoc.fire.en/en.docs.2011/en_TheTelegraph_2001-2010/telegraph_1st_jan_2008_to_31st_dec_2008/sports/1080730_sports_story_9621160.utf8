The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dalmiya factor keeps all on edge
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dalmiya factor keeps all on edge
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) mandarins werent the only ones desperate for an update on the trend in the lead-up to Tuesdays AGM of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB).         
	Indeed, The Telegraph received calls from administrators beyond the shores of India as well.         
	They had just one question: Would Jagmohan Dalmiya regain control of the Eden Gardens, from where hed called the shots globally?         
	Dalmiya, after all, once headed the International Cricket Council, the Afro-Asian body (which he helped set up), the Asian Cricket Council, the BCCI and, of course, the CAB.         
	Everybodys interest was understandable, given that a victory in the CAB elections would allow Dalmiya to gain a toehold in the BCCI. It would be the start of a fresh innings.         
	Thats why such unprecedented attention on what has to be termed a local election.         
	Dalmiya, it may be recalled, held control of the CAB till December 2006, when the BCCI expelled him  the price he had to pay for opposing Sharad Pawar.         
	On Tuesday, Dalmiya successfully challenged Prasun Mukherjee, whom hed defeated in the 2006 elections. The one-time supremo of world cricket kept his promise that history would be repeated.

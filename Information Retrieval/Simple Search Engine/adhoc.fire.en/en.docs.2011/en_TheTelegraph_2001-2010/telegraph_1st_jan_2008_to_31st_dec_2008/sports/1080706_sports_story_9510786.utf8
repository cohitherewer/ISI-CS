The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ajantha is a big game player, says Mahela
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ajantha is a big game player, says Mahela
  - There are no demons in the pitch and we might prefer to bat: Sri Lanka captain             Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene and coach Trevor Bayliss during a training session in Karachi on Saturday. (AFP)                           
	Karachi: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene feels that Ajantha Mendis is a big game player and could tame the Indian batsmen in the Asia Cup final on Sunday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Ajantha Mendiss performance         
	Its good that everyone is talking about Ajantha, so other bowlers can chip in unannounced and take three or four wickets.         
	The role of the other players         
	Different people play a role at certain stages of the match. If fast bowlers bowl in the right areas, and outsmart the batsmen they can play a role. And in the middle overs, when the wicket gets slower, the spinners can come in.         
	If he was banking on Mendis         
	We will have to wait and see He is a big-game player for what we have seen. He doesnt bother even if he is hit for six sixes. He hasnt played enough cricket to realise the pressure; he just comes in and does his best.         
	On the psychological factor after losing the last group match to India         
	Not much Like I said, whatever we have done in the past we can take the positives with us. We cant think about how Pakistanis and Indians have done. For us its all about the way we have gone about in the tournament and how we can apply ourselves tomorrow. Simple as that... We will have a gameplan and we will try to execute that to the best of our ability.         
	Handling Muttiah Muralidharan and Mendis together         
	It all depends on the situation... Whether we can have them both together. It is difficult to premeditate how you are going to use Murali or Mendis.         
	The toss factor         
	Runs on the board are very crucial. We have done well batting first. There are no demons in the pitch and we might prefer to bat but looking at the way the games have gone winning the toss doesnt make a huge difference.

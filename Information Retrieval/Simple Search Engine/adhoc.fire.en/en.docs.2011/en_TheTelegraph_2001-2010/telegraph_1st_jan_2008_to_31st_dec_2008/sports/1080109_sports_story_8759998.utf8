The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I feel for Steve: Darrell 
                                                I feel for Steve: Darrell 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Darrell Hair says he feels for Steve Bucknor and knows what he going through, according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald.         
	The ICC, bowing to pressure by India, has axed Bucknor from next weeks third Test between India and Australia in Perth in the wake of the controversial Sydney Test.         
	 I feel for Steve, Hair was quoted as saying by the paper. In a way, its probably the best for him to stand down and relieve the pressure a little bit.         
	ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed, announcing the decision, compared the controversies to those of the forfeited Oval Test, which led to Hairs being dropped from the Elite Panel. Should Bucknor share the same fate, Hair could fill the breach. He is up for review in March.         
	The desire to come back is strong, Hair said. I am still working with the ICC at the associate level and I will be working as an umpiring assessor at the youth World Cup, but I would love to make it back to the top level again.         
	Hair also wants the ICC to embrace an umpiring referral system that could help relieve pressure on the umpires.         
	He also supported the ICCs referral system that will allow players to appeal against decisions by the umpires.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Caribbean cruise for England
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Caribbean cruise for England

	Port of Spain: Jermain Defoes double strike helped England cruise to a 3-0 friendly victory against Trinidad and Tobago in a one-sided friendly in sultry conditions on a bone-hard pitch on Sunday.         
	Fabio Capello must wish every match could be as easy as this stroll in the Caribbean sunshine at Port of Spains Hasely Crawford Stadium.         
	England flexed their muscles through Gareth Barrys first international goal and a neat finish from Defoe within the opening 16 minutes on Sunday.         
	But, while Defoe staked his first-team claim with another goal in the second half, Capello can have learnt little else because Trinidad were the most obliging of hosts. They allowed England the time and space to dominate without ever needing to raise the tempo much beyond walking pace.         
	Yet the prospect of flying thousands of miles for a meaningless game at the end of a gruelling season could have produced a less than committed display from Capellos team.         
	So it is to the Italians credit that England gave the match their full attention for as long as it took to ensure a comfortable victory.         
	They could have scored more but Capello will be happy enough that his team go into the more serious business of qualifying for the 2010 world cup with two successive wins.         
	The absence of seven Manchester United and Chelsea players rested by Capello gave Englands understudies a rare chance to shine.         
	Dean Ashton finally made his debut two years after a broken ankle denied the West Ham forward his first international appearance.         
	There was also a first start in 15 months for Tottenham defender Jonathan Woodgate, while Capello used his fourth captain in four matches as David Beckham took the armband for the 59th time.         
	In stifling heat approaching 90 degrees, Trinidads hopes of a famous victory suffered an early blow. Kenwyne Jones chased a long ball over Rio Ferdinand and David James rushed out to tackle the Sunderland striker.         
	James won the ball but Jones crumpled into a heap and had to be stretchered off.         
	It took England 83 minutes to score against Trinidad when they last met in the 2006 world cup. This time they broke the deadlock after just 12 minutes.         
	Stewart Downing chipped a pass to Wayne Bridge, whose cross was met by Barry with a close range volley that gave Clayton Ince no chance.         
	England doubled their advantage four minutes later. Downings pass sent Defoe clear down the left edge of the penalty area and, with no defender tracking back, he steered a low shot past Ince into the far corner.         
	The hosts backed off again before half time to allow Steven Gerrard to cross towards Defoe, but the Portsmouth striker blazed his volley well over. (AGENCIES)

  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Record-holder on one snapping at his heels         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mohinder Amarnath                                 
	Calcutta: Actually, Mohinder Jimmy Amarnath holds two records, not just the unofficial one for having made umpteen comebacks. The other, well-documented, is: Being the Indian cricketer with the longest international (Tests and ODIs) career.         
	On Saturday, the day Sachin Tendulkar got out of the teens as an International, Mohinder spoke to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On being the Indian cricketer with the longest international career (a shade under 20 years)         
	(Laughs) I knew I had a long career, but didnt realise it was that long! Feels nice to be at the top, but records are meant to be broken and, so, some- body will surely break the one held by me.         
	Secret of his longevity         
	Dont know whether there was a secret or not, all I wanted to do was represent the country... Id be in and out of the team and wouldnt take it lying down when I got dropped... Id work even harder and make a comeback, driven by the belief that I was good enough to play for India... Id try and prove people wrong.         
	Late father Lala holding the India record for the longest Test career (exactly 19 years)         
	Is it? I wasnt aware... Again, somebody will break that record.         
	[Unless hes not available, which is highly unlikely, Sachin will overtake the Senior Amarnath on Day I of next months Motera Test against England.]         
	Sachin completing 19 years as an India cricketer         
	Hes such a great player... Weve been honoured to see him play... Watching Sachin bat gives so much pleasure.         
	What sets Sachin apart from the rest         
	His passion, which hasnt been diluted even 19 years after his first appearance for the country... Hes been among the runs and, when youre scoring, the enjoyment is that much more... Sachin has remained focused all these years and that has allowed him to come back stronger even when he has had injuries... Hes achieved everything, I guess.         
	His first interaction with Sachin         
	He was 14-15 when I interviewed him for a TV show and, when I asked who would he eventually like to be, he didnt say Sunil Gavaskar or Viv Richards (his heroes), but Sachin Tendulkar... Wouldnt say I was shocked, but definitely amazed. I mean, what confidence for a schoolboy.         
	Message for Sachin         
	(Laughs) Its not for me to give a message... Just keep carrying on... Keep fit... Obviously, he has my good wishes.         
	Finally, whether Sachin should make himself available till the 2011 World Cup         
	If hes fit, why not? He certainly has some years left in him... The bottom line is that Sachin, who is 35, has to manage his fitness... Thats all... Therell be nothing like it if he can do that.

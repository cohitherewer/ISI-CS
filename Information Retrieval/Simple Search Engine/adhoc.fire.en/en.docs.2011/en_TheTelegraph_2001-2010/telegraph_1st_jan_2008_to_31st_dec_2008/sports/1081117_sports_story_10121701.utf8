The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina can be No. 1: Padukone
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Saina can be No. 1: Padukone
                      
	Bangalore: Saina Nehwal is champion material and in another three years, India can look forward to seeing a world No. 1 in the Hyderabad youngster, said legendary shuttler Prakash Padukone.         
	Seventeen-year-old Saina has most of the qualities a champion needs  physical, technical, mental and self-belief  the former All England Champion said.         
	If she continues to work hard and remain focused, there is no reason why she cant reach the very top, Padukone, himself a former world No. 1 and a World Cup winner, said.         
	It (Saina becoming world No. 1) is definitely possible. She is already at 11 (in world rankings) now. Its just a matter of time before she breaks into the top 10, he said.         
	I think within a year, she is definitely capable of being in top five, and go on to even become No. 1 may be in two-three years, he said.         
	This year has been an extraordinary one for Saina, who reached the quarter finals in the Beijing Olympics and won the recent World Junior Badminton title.         
	If she continues like this, she has got everything going right, Padukone said, terming her performance in the two events as impressive, creditable and commendable.         
	One can look forward to some great performances from her in the future, he said.         
	Saina needs to plan her tournament schedule properly, Padukone said, advising her to be selective about tournaments and space them out in such a way that she gets enough time and rest and can work on her weaknesses in between.         
	Training for short stints abroad  may be in Malaysia or Indonesia  would be a good idea for her as such outings would help her familiarise more with the type of game that foreigners play.         
	They (foreign players) play a different kind of game, compared to the Indians. So, that does not come as a surprise to you when you play them (If you have short training stints abroad), Padukone said.         
	On her quarter final defeat at the Beijing Games, he said that was more due to lack of her experience. (PTI)

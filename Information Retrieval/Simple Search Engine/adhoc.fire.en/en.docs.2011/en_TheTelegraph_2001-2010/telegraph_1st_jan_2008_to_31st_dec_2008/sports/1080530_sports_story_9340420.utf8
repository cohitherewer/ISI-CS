                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vengsarkar seeks fitness reports
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar has asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to arrange for the fitness reports of the Indian players from the physios of the eight teams in the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Ive asked the BCCI secretary (Niranjan Shah) to arrange for the reports before my colleagues and I start the selection meeting on Friday, Vengsarkar, a former India captain, told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	He added: Ive done so because we need to be clear if somebody is carrying an injury We need to know things first-hand         
	Vengsarkar, though, declined to comment on senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkars non-availability. I dont have the details and, so, wouldnt like to say anything.         
	Eyebrows, however, are being raised as to how Sachin played for the Mumbai Indians (in the IPL) if he hadnt fully recovered from a groin injury.         
	There was talk that Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma had major fitness worries, but Shah clarified they were fit.         
	Of late, both Gambhir and Sharma have played crucial roles in Team Indias ODI campaigns.

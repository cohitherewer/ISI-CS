The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | There are no guarantees in sport, says Sourav Ganguly
                                                                                                                                                                                                       There are no guarantees in sport, says Sourav Ganguly
    - Despite being overlooked for Irani, former India Captain keeps date with kids             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            WHAT NEXT? Sourav Ganguly at the prize distribution ceremony of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Gorky Sadan in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                 
	Calcutta: There are some things to learn from Sourav Ganguly, one being honouring commitments.         
	Given the circumstances, it wouldnt have shocked had the former India captain conveyed his regrets and opted out of wearing the chief guests hat at The Telegraph Schools Chess prize distribution ceremony on Monday evening.         
	Just three hours earlier, after all, hed been ignored for the Irani Trophy, a trial match for the forthcoming Test series against Australia.         
	Sourav, however, kept his date with the kids.         
	I skipped the afternoon training session Id planned, but didnt want to disappoint the children, he remarked during the course of his 65-minute stay at the Gorky Sadan.         
	In his speech, among other things, Sourav made the point that there are no guarantees in sport.         
	A telling observation, really.                     
	Having been the chief guest twice before, in 1996 (soon after his sensational Test debut) and in 1999 (after a successful World Cup), Sourav knew that obliging fans would be par for the course.         
	It wasnt any different this time and he was most touched when one of the girls (a prize winner in the main category) said: Youve been such an inspiration         
	Another winner, this time a boy, requested that he get to play cricket alongside his icon.         
	Grinning, Sourav responded: Id rather play chess with you! One wont have to worry about certain things         
	Checkmate, shall we say?

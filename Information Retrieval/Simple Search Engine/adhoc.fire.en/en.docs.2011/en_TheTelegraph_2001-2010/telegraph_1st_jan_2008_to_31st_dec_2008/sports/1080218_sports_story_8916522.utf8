The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky: Dhoni fall the turning point 
                                                   Ricky: Dhoni fall the turning point 
            A CORRESPONDENT                       
	Adelaide: Ricky Ponting said Mahendra Singh Dhonis run-out was the turning point in Australias win over India at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday. The game was in the balance till Dhoni was run out. India probably had their noses in front a bit at that stage, Ponting told a news conference.         
	Ponting brushed aside suggestions that off-field distractions regarding Australian participation in the IPL had led to his current slump in form. I have been around long enough to separate cricket from other things, he said.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	Q What was the turning point of the match?         
	A I thought the game was in the balance till Dhoni was run out. India probably had their noses in front a bit at that stage. I always thought we had given ourselves a good chance, because even though we made only 203, India were a batsman light. Once again, our bowlers were very good and Michael (Clarke) played sensibly. It was another very good win.         
	Are you surprised that the bowlers have called the shots thus far in the series?         
	Even though we have played on very good batting wickets, the bowlers have dominated in every game. India bowled very well today but our bowlers bowled were better. A few of our batsmen are going through ruts at the same time, and that is really unusual for our team. We are not that concerned because we are still winning games and with bonus points.         
	Was Indias batting line-up short on experience?         
	Its always nice to have a good balance of youth and experience. Its something we have been conscious of. India dont probably have that mix now, but they are in a bit of a rebuilding phase to their one-day team... Every team goes through it.         
	Has the IPL issue been affecting your form?         
	My bad run is not because of other things. I have been around long enough to separate cricket from other things. When it is cricket time for me, it is cricket time.

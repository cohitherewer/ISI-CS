The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rahul will bounce back: Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                             Rahul will bounce back: Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER              Sourav Ganguly                       
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly came out in support of Rahul Dravid dismissing claims that the Wall is showing signs of vulnerability.         
	Dravid is a great cricketer with a lot of maturity. It will be wrong to say that its over for him, Ganguly said after a practice session at the Eden Gardens Friday.         
	Dravid with 10,366 Test runs to his name has managed just two centuries and nine 50s in the 48 innings he has played over the last two years.         
	Dravids last five innings read a dismal 11, 11, 0, 3 and 3.         
	But Ganguly, who retired after the Test series against Australia recently, believes Dravids return to form is just a matter of time.         
	One should not judge him on a few failures. It is a temporary loss of form and I am sure hell come up with a big knock soon to silence his critics, Ganguly said.         
	The former India captain is currently keeping himself in shape and is hoping to play in the Ranji Trophy Plate group semi-final and help Bengal return to the Super League.         
	Ganguly had earlier expressed his desire to turn up against Vidarbha in the Plate group but since Bengal have already made the semi-finals, he chose to wait for the last-four stage.         
	I am eager to play for Bengal in the semi-finals. We are currently doing well in the league stage and I am sure well make the Super League, Ganguly, who had a rigourous indoor and outdoor session, at the Eden added.         
	Asked, whether India should tour Pakistan in the wake of the Mumbai terror strikes, Ganguly declined comment.         
	Asked whether the terror strikes will put a shadow on Pakistan cricketers Shoaib Akhtar and Umar Gul who are his teammates in Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Ganguly said there was still plenty of time for the second edition of the Twenty20 competition to begin.         
	IPL is still some months to go. I hope things will get normal by then, Ganguly said, adding that Eden will host a KKR camp from January 6 to scout for talent in the domestic circuit.

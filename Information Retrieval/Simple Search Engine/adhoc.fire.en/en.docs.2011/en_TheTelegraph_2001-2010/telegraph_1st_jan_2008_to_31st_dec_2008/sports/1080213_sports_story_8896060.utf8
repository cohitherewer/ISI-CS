The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shooters hit by SAI guidelines
                                                   Shooters hit by SAI guidelines
                      
	Jaipur: Indias Olympic shooters preparations for Beijing have been hit by yet another delay to the start of a national camp  the second in a fortnight. The camp has been hit by the unavailability of ammunition after SAI directed state associations to provide participants with the equipment they need.         
	According to the guidelines, sports federations must arrange for any equipment needed during national camps and the expenditure incurred would be later reimbursed.         
	Rajasthan Rifle Shooting Association president Sushil Chowdhary said the camp was to have begun on Monday but that none of the 33 shooters turned up.         
	 It is difficult for the associations to import the required equipment because of various hassles in the long process and the heavy cost involved too is a deterrent despite the promised reimbursement, he said.         
	The Asian Clay Shooting Championship begins on February 21 and the Olympics arent too far away either.         
	The shooters, including those who have qualified for the Olympic Games, are the worst hit, he said.         
	The camp in Delhi, which was to be held from February 1, was also hit by the shortage of ammunition. Some of the shooters, however, brought their own pellets and it eventually began on February 5.         
	We too are looking for the same way out but most of the shooters, like Shagun Chowdhary, have already exhausted their stock. We will try others and see if the camp can be arranged later, said Chowdhary.

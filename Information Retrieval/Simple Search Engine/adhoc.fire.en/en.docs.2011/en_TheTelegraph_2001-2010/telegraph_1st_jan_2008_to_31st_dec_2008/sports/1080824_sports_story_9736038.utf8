The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI academy   in state
                                                                                                                                                                                           BCCI academy   in state
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to set up an academy here in a bid to improve the game in the North Eastern states.         
	At its working committee meeting on Saturday, it was decided that the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will look after it and the BCCI will provide the funds. The CAB would also have to look for land. Its not necessary that the academy should be set up in the city. If we get a good place in North Bengal, we may think of setting it up there, an official said. The CAB has recently zeroed in on a plot of land at Haldia for setting up its own academy.         
	Meanwhile, the 27 affiliated units of the BCCI, who take part in domestic tournaments, are all set to reap a windfall following the huge revenue generated by the body through sale of telecast rights last season.

	Mumbai: Shah Rukh Khan, the Kolkata Knight Riders owner, has advised the controversial Shoaib Akhtar to apologise to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for having said certain things which he shouldnt have.         
	Shoaib has been banned for five years and unless the PCBs appeals tribunal overturns the disciplinary committees punishment, he wont (for starters) be able to turn out for the Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League.         
	Im older to Shoaib and, as I see the team and its players as my children, Ive advised that he tender an apology... That, I believe, could help the PCB take a somewhat different view, Shah Rukh told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening.         
	Smiling, Shah Rukh added: In fact, Ive been dreaming that Shoaib will play our first game (in Bangalore, April 18) and take three wickets in the very first over... Its not that Ive gone out of my way to support Shoaib, Id do so for every player in my team...         
	The advice, incidentally, has been conveyed through Shoaibs manager.         
	According to Shah Rukh, if the ban isnt revoked, then the punishment will end Shoaibs career at all levels. Look, hes 32 and how many more years can he play? Youve got to accept that hes been among the few crowdpullers in the past decade or so.         
	While Shah Rukh is worried on the Shoaib front (though coach John Buchanan has been a calming influence), Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly has brought much joy.         
	Sourav was absolutely awesome in Motera the other day... He was unlucky to be given out (on 87), but till hed been at the wicket, I was hopeful that India would save that Test... Dil wahi keh raha tha, Shah Rukh pointed out.         
	Shah Rukh confirmed hed be present during the Knight Riders first match, the game versus Mumbai here (May 16) and all 7 home matches at the Eden.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Charlesworth flayed for non-cooperation 
                                                   Charlesworth flayed for non-cooperation 
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Indian hockey teams assistant coach Ramesh Parameshwaran on Saturday came down heavily on Ric Charlesworth, alleging that the legendary Australian demoralised the morale of the players before the start of the Olympic qualifiers in Chile.         
	Ric was only psyching our players  repeatedly telling them that the Indian team could expect results only after four years  demoralising the morale of the players.         
	He did not share any inputs about any of the teams when we had played in Perth (for exhibition matches) Did not show any keenness to work with the chief coach (Joaquim Carvalho) nor the coaching staff during our training or match days there.         
	Questioning the Australians attitude, Parameshwaran noted: When we lost the second game to Western Australia 2-4, he ridiculed the team with a big laughter and deserted the team, but came back to us only after we started winning the rest of the games.         
	India failed to make the Olympic cut  the first ever since the game was introduced in 1928  after going down to Great Britain in the Chile qualifiers.

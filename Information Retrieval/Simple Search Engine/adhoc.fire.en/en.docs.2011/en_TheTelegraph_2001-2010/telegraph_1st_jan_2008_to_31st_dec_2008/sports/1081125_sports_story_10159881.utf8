The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cesc to lead Arsenal
                                                                                                                                                                                           Cesc to lead Arsenal
                      
	London: Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas replaced William Gallas as Arsenal captain on Monday after the defender was punished for making critical comments about his teammates.         
	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger dropped Gallas from the team which lost 3-0 to Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday and the Frenchman has now been stripped of the captaincy.         
	Wenger told a news conference on Monday that Gallas would return for Tuesdays Champions League Group G match against Dynamo Kiev. Asked if he would be captain, Wenger replied: No. It will be Fabregas.         
	He confirmed that Fabregas would be a permanent appointment.         
	William is a player that I rate. He was working as a captain in a very difficult media environment and was under pressure from the press, Wenger said. I do not to have to explain to you why I make the decisions. When you dont win, nobody jumps off the roof and the frustration kicks in when your team doesnt win. This is a good opportunity to show that we have strength and ability. You know how the media works, you go from catastrophe to fantastic.

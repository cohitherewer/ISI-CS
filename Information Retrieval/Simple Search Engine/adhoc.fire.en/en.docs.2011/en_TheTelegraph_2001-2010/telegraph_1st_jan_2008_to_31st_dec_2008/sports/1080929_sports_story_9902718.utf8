The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gebrselassie record
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gebrselassie record
                      
	Berlin: Ethiopias Haile Gebrselassie was delighted to put his recent calf injury behind to break his own world record on Sunday at the Berlin Marathon for the second successive year.         
	The 35-year-old brushed aside a calf injury he suffered in training two weeks ago to come home in a time of 2::03:59sec.         
	He took nearly half-a-minute off his own previous world record of 2::04:26sec.         
	This was the sixth time the world record has been broken in Berlin on the flat course.         
	I am so, so happy, everything was perfect, the weather was perfect, the spectators were perfect, everything  I am so happy said the Ethiopian.         
	Two weeks ago I had a bit of a problem with my calf muscle, but I took a week off. It gave me a few worries coming here, but I forgot about it as the race wore on. I knew before I came here I could do something special, if you look from the beginning, everyone in Berlin seems to come and watch the race, its a wonderful feeling, he said.         
	The twice Olympic 5000m champion has plenty of reasons to be happy. Apart from breaking the 26th world record, he received $73,000 for winning on top of his $365,000 fee for racing here. It was his sixth victory in his ninth marathon. (AFP)

	London: Arsenal scored a late goal to force a 1-1 draw against Aston Villa although their lead at the top of the Premier League was cut to one point after Manchester United won 3-0 at Fulham on Saturday.         
	Substitute Nicklas Bendtner netted with seconds remaining to deny Villa victory and take Arsenal to 65 points, one more than United who stay second.         
	Third-placed Chelsea won 4-0 at West Ham United despite having Frank Lampard, who scored the opening goal against his former side, sent off after 33 minutes for what appeared to be an innocuous push on Luis Boa Morte.         
	Chelsea have 58 points and a game in hand on the top two.         
	For much of the afternoon, Arsenal struggled against Villa and looked to be heading for their first home league defeat of the season.         
	Villa went ahead when Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos turned a Gabriel Agbonlahor shot into his own net after 27 minutes and were in control with some excellent football. However, Arsenal kept pushing forward and were rewarded just before the end with Bendtners close-range goal.         
	Manchester United, who had not been beaten at Fulham since 1964, never looked like losing that record after Owen Hargreaves put them ahead with a clever free-kick in the 15th minute.         
	Park Ji-sungs header and a Simon Davies own goal gave United a straightforward victory, leaving Fulham deep in relegation trouble.         
	Birmingham City improved their chances of avoiding the drop with a 4-1 home victory over League Cup winners Tottenham Hotspur thanks to a Mikael Forssell hattrick.         
	Sebastian Larsson, who struck a stunning winner when Birmingham beat Spurs 3-2 at White Hart Lane in December, scored again from a free kick early in the second half.         
	Spurs, who beat Chelsea to win the League Cup last Sunday, slumped to their heaviest loss of the season.         
	There was no joy for Newcastle United, who dominated at home against Blackburn Rovers but lost to a late breakaway goal from Matt Derbyshire that secured a 1-0 win.

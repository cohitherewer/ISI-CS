	IPL not to be blamed for Hayden injury: CA  Melbourne: Criticised for allowing key players to participate in the Indian Premier League after Matthew Hayden was forced to return from the tour of the West Indies, Cricket Australia (CA) on Friday refused to admit that the League was the reason behind the flaring up of the opener rsquo;s achilles tendon. CA spokesman Peter Young said the risks of releasing players to the IPL were the same as the traditional pilgrimage to England every winter. ldquo;Matthew has had achilles tendinitis for quite a while and people are used to him packing it with ice, rdquo; Young was quoted as saying by a local newspaper.    
	 Butt impressed  Karachi: Pakistan opener Salman Butt, fresh from his stint in the Indian Premier League (IPL), on Friday said the Twenty20 format had made the bowlers as well as the batsmen think hard to be more creative. ldquo;I feel the Twenty20 matches have made the bowlers and batsmen think, rdquo; said Butt, who returned home from India on Friday. ldquo;Bowlers now have to bowl yorkers and slower ones in the death overs to do well and this can be dodgy for the batsmen as well and they have to adjust accordingly, rdquo; added Butt.    
	 Member quits  Karachi: Salman Taseer, a member of the appellate tribunal hearing Shoaib Akhtar rsquo;s case, on Friday resigned after being appointed as the governor of Punjab. Taseer sent in his resignation to the Pakistan Cricket Board, pointing out that after his appointment as governor he was not in a position to sit on the tribunal due to time constraints.     
	 Crowe rsquo;s lament  New Delhi: Bangalore Royal Challengers rsquo; chief cricket officer Martin Crowe has admitted that the lack of specialist batsmen was the major reason behind their lacklustre performance in the IPL. The former New Zealand skipper also blamed the lack of facilities for the Vijay Mallya-owned team rsquo;s debacle.    
	 England squad  London: Wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose was the only uncapped one-day International player named in England rsquo;s 14-man squad on Friday for a five-match series and a Twenty20 International against New Zealand.  THE SQUAD

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brad Hodge to leave for national duty
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Brad Hodge to leave for national duty
            A STAFF REPORTER            Brad Hodge                           
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders will miss the services of Brad Hodge after Cricket Australia (CA) named the Twenty20 specialist batsman as a shadow player for vice-captain Michael Clarke who is uncertain to join the squad for the tour of the West Indies.         
	According to a CA release on Friday, Clarke would stay back even though his teammates depart on Saturday night after being given compassionate leave for family reasons. His date of arrival in the West Indies is currently unclear, the release added.         
	According to CA selection panel chairman Andrew Hilditch: Brad has had another strong domestic season with the Victorian Bushrangers in all forms of the game. He is still very highly regarded by the national selection panel and this provides him with another opportunity to be involved with the Australian squad.         
	Hodge, who is leaving on Saturday night, termed the development as unfortunate for his IPL team, more so since the Knight Riders hastily roped him in after losing Australia captain Ricky Ponting and New Zealand keeper-batsman Brendon McCullum who left to join national duties.         
	Obviously its disappointing for the team After the win last night (Thursday) which ended a four-match losing streak. Its tough for me having just flown in And Im flying back on Saturday, the 33-year-old told reporters at the team hotel on Friday.         
	Even as the details are yet to be finalised, it is likely that Hodge will join his Australian teammates in either Dubai or London as they travel to the West Indies.         
	The Australian, however, added: Youve to attend whenever country calls That comes first. At the same time Ill definitely miss playing for Kolkata Knight Riders. Hopefully Ill be back soon.         
	Asked whether the top-order, which has been rather shaky, will be hit hard, Hodge said: I dont think the team will face a problem. There are many players who can fill in my role. Wriddhiman Saha looked good during his (59-run unbeaten) knock against Kings XI Punjab. (Ashok) Dinda bowled well last (Thursday) night. Obviously theres a lot of talent.         
	Hodge expressed hope that the boys pick up momentum from here on and make the last four. Hopefully we just kick off from this win and if we can win four matches in a row it wont be tough.         
	On the five-run win over Bangalore Royal Challengers, the Australian said it was one of the best moments in his career. Playing and winning in Calcutta was one of the more memorable experiences for me. We celebrated the Australian way  with a couple of quiet beers.         
	He felt that it was Souravs economical bowling which turned the match in their favour. We batted and fielded well But it was Souravs bowling (having conceded seven runs from three overs and the wicket of Rahul Dravid), which turned the match in our favour.         
	The Australian signed off saying meeting owner Shah Rukh Khan was a cherished moment. Theres something about his persona He carries it so well, yet so natural. I liked meeting him.

	London: Romanian club CFR Cluj will believe anything is possible on Wednesday when they host Chelsea in the Champions League having blazed a trail for the competitions supposed lightweights two weeks ago.         
	Their stunning 2-1 victory against Roma in the Italian capital quickly put paid to the notion that the team from Transylvania boasting an exotic mix of South Americans would lack real bite on their Champions League debut.         
	Likewise, fellow debutants Anorthosis Famagusta from Cyprus will face Panathinaikos in Group B on Wednesday with no inferiority complex having marked their rise to Europes elite echelon with a gritty 0-0 draw at Werder Bremen.         
	Champions Manchester United will need to be on their guard too at Danish outsiders Aalborg BK on Tuesday as they try and make up for a sterile 0-0 draw against Villarreal on opening night when Aalborg held Celtic in Glasgow.                   
	Shock seekers will also have one eye on Juventus who take a trip into the unknown to face Belarus representatives Bate Borisov. who held their own despite a 2-0 defeat by nine-times European kings Real Madrid on their debut in the competition.         
	Uefa Cup holders Zenit St Petersburg complete the clutch of fixtures sending established Champions League regulars to unfamiliar and potentially tricky surroundings when they welcome Real Madrid having lost 0-1 to Juventus.         
	One of the heavyweight clashes of the second round of group fixtures occurs in Munich on Tuesday when Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich host Olympique Lyon.         
	On Wednesday Italian champions Inter Milan host Werder Bremen and Barcelona make the long trek to the Ukraine to play a Shakhtar Donetsk side traditionally strong at home.         
	Like United, Arsenal had a shaky start to their campaign, needing a late equaliser at Dynamo Kiev.

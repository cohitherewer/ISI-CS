                                                Carberry leads Lions to victory
                      
	Vadodara: A solid knock of 112 runs by left-hander Michael Carberry helped England Lions to score a five wicket win over Central Zone in a Duleep Trophy match at the Motibauh ground Wednesday.         
	The England Lions had to peak through some anxious moments after losing three wickets of Carberry (112), Ed Joyce (54) and James Foster (0) in six runs in a span of four overs.         
	It was an unbroken 48-run sixth wicket partnership between Jonathan Trott (28) and Adil Rashid (24) which made the task easy for them.         
	Resuming at 146 for one, Lions failed to add to their overnight total as Yardy got out at his overnight not out total of 57 runs.         
	After fall of his wicket, it was Carberry and Joyce who took the total up to 244 runs for three wickets and added 96 runs for the third wicket partnership.         
	Central captain Mohammed Kaifs decision of taking new ball paid dividend and got the important wicket of Carberry who was declared lbw off medium-pacer Sumith Mathur made an strong appeal. Carberrys well made 112 runs included 15 fours and a six.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Youngsters responded well: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Youngsters responded well: Dhoni
                      
	Colombo: More than breaking a long-standing jinx, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is happy with the fact that he led the side to a historic ODI series win in Sri Lanka in the absence of star players Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag.         
	Dhoni said the team did miss a few players but the youngsters responded well to fill in the vacuum.         
	It is not about depending or not depending (on a few players). Of course it is an achievement but you can not just sit back on it and say we won the Twenty20 (World Cup), the tri-series in Australia or now here in Sri Lanka. You have to continue doing it, said Dhoni, insisting winning should be a habit for the side.         
	We didnt have Ishant, we didnt have Sachin and Veeru (Sehwag) who was in prime form. But it is upto other individuals to take up the responsibility. They are the guys who are part of the 16 who can really make a difference and they were doing just that, Dhoni said.

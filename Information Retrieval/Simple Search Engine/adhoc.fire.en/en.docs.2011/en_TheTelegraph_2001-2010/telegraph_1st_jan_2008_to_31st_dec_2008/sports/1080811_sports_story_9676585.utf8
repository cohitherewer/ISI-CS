	Beijing: The millionaire stars of the US basketball team swept past hosts China in the showcase match-up of the Olympics, watched by tens of millions on Chinese television and cheered on by US President George W. Bush.         
	In football, Ronaldinho scored twice as Brazil strolled to a 5-0 win over New Zealand on Sunday, while a delightful goal from Ezequiel Lavezzi gave Argentina a late win over stubborn Australia.         
	The wins left the South American pair with six points from two games in their respective groups and guaranteed both a quarter final place with a match to spare. Italy joined them, beating South Korea 3-0 with a refreshingly positive display to chalk up their second straight win by the same score.         
	Talismanic giant Yao Ming, flag carrier for China at the opening ceremony, could not protect his colleagues from the speed and power of the NBA professionals.         
	Ming, who plays with the Houston Rockets, scored 13 points in the 101-70 loss to the US in what was billed as the most watched basketball game in history.         
	Bush and his father, former President George H. W. Bush, huddled with the U.S. team ahead of the game to wish them luck.         
	Whats up, pops? NBA scoring champion LeBron James quipped to Bushs ageing father.         
	The US team is still smarting from winning only bronze at Athens in 2004 and has nicknamed itself the Redeem Team. They have joked they will be unable to return home without the gold.         
	Australias Stephanie Rice followed Michael Phelps with a world record of her own in the womens 400 individual medley.         
	The US broke the world record in the mens 100 freestyle relay heats. Phelps will be part of the team for Mondays final.         
	Britain won their first gold of the Games in the womens cycling road race. Nicole Cooke triumphed in surprisingly cold, wet and slippery conditions on the route from Beijings Forbidden City imperial palace complex to the Great Wall.

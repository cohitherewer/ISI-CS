The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds apologises 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Symonds apologises 
                    Andrew Symonds                
	Melbourne: Troubled Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds on Tuesday apologised for the gone-fishing episode and promised to return to the side a better person.         
	I apologise for some of the things Ive done over the last little bit. Hopefully Ill come out of it a better person and not make those mistakes in the future, Symonds said in his first interaction with the media since his sacking from the side for lacking commitment.         
	Symonds preferred a fishing trip to a compulsory team meeting, inviting the wrath of the leadership group comprising stand-in skipper Michael Clarke, coach Tim Nielson and manager Steve Bernard.         
	The 33-year-old was subsequently sent home from Darwin where Australia played a three-match ODI series against Bangladesh.         
	Symonds, who was also omitted from the squad for the upcoming Test series against India for his indiscretion, said he has realised his mistakes and promised to change his attitude.         
	I think I probably do need to put a little bit of thought into some of the things I am doing, Symonds said.         
	Im in a position of responsibility and I cant live so irresponsibly and Ive realised that. Its probably taken longer than it should have, he added.         
	Symonds asserted he would bounce back from the latest setback by focussing on his cricket even as he learns to deal with life as a public figure.         
	You go from being something and you get something cast over you which you have no control of. Being recognised and that sort of thing is something that sometimes I deal with well and other times I dont deal with as well, he said.         
	I like my time by myself and I like my privacy, but I do love the challenge of cricket. Im going through the process of trying to improve and become not only a better cricketer but a better person, he added.         
	Symonds apology comes after he was lambasted by former greats like Steve Waugh and Shane Warne for his attitude.         
	The big-hitting allrounders commitment to the team was also questioned with his one-time close pal Clarke being among his most vocal critics during the entire episode.         
	Cricket Australia had even asked him to take a counsellors help to get his career back on track.         
	Dropping Symonds for the upcoming series was not a bad decision if it was felt that he was not focused on the team, retired Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist said in Mumbai.         
	It will be a major blow not to have him in the squad, but if he was not focused on the team it was not a bad decision, Gilchrist, who played 96 Tests for Australia, said.         
	Symonds was dropped from the squad which will tour India after he chose to go on a fishing trip instead of attending a team meeting prior to a match against Bangladesh last month.         
	He (Symonds) has to make sure that no one takes his spot in the team. May be being dropped for the series is a good thing for him to get himself mentally and physically fit to return to the team, Gilchrist said.         
	Gilchrist said he was confident Brad Haddin, his replacement in the team, would fill the void created by his own retirement coupled with Symonds absence.           (PTI)

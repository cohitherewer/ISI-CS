The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Scolari to lay down the law 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Scolari to lay down the law

	London: Chelseas players could be in for a shock on Monday when they start training under new manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari.         
	It was widely perceived that the players were effectively running team affairs during Avram Grants nine months in charge, and a number of incidents suggested standards of off-field discipline had slipped.         
	Those who have worked with Scolari insist that is all over.         
	He is very demanding with discipline, said Adilson, manager of Brazilian side Cruzeiro, who played for Scolari at Gremio and Jubilo Iwata, in Japan, and then served his apprenticeship as a coach under him at Cruzeiro. His great strength is his authority and his ability to command the group.         
	Scolari begins his task on Sunday at Cobham, where he will meet ground staff and club officials. He will sit down on Monday with Frank Lampard, who continues to be linked with former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho at Internazionale.         
	More talks, with Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka are expected later this week. Like Mourinho, Scolari inspires a ferocious loyalty, provided his players toe the line and play to expectations.         
	Scolari knows how to mould a squad very easily, said Euller, a forward who was part of the Palmeiras side Scolari led to their first Copa Libertadores title. He added: Dealing with famous players is not a problem for him.         
	Like Mourinho, he holds no truck with players he feels are not giving their all. The case of Marcos is typical. When the regular keeper Velloso was injured, Scolari turned to Marcos during Palmeirass run to the Libertadores in 1999. He was superb in the penalty shoot-out victory over Palmeirass great rivals Corinthians in the quarter final, and played so well for the rest of the season that he earned a call-up to the national squad.         
	They had a close relationship but, the next year, Marcos pulled out of a league game in Brazil, citing injury, even though the club doctors had cleared him.

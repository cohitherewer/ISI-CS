                                                                                                                                                                                                       Federer, Nadal set up Paris rematch again
    - History beckons the top two players in mens tennis                 Roger Federer at Roland Garros on Friday                           
	Paris: Twice Roger Federer took an awkward spill on Friday, leaving the regal champion sprawled on the clay.         
	The French Open can be humbling, as Federer well knows, but hell try again for his first Roland Garros title on Sunday against nemesis Rafael Nadal.         
	The top-ranked Federer endured some messy moments in the semi-final. Knocked down but not out, he wiped off the dirt and beat unseeded Frenchman Gael Monfils 6-2, 5-7, 6-3, 7-5.         
	Nadals semi-final was close only by his standards: He lost 12 games and nearly lost a set. The king of clay beat No. 3 seed Novak Djokovic 6-4, 6-2, 7-6 (3).         
	Nadal had lost only three games in each of his previous two matches and he is one win from becoming the first player since Bjorn Borg in 1981 to win four consecutive French Open titles. Federer is seeking the only Grand Slam title he has yet to win.         
	Against Federer is special, Nadal said. I will try and face history.         
	Federer struggled at times against Monfils, especially in the final game of the second set, when he looked nervous serving and shanked a forehand on the final shot.         
	The partisan crowd roared, sensing a possible upset, but Federer regained his composure and endured some brilliant play by the streaky Monfils down the stretch.         
	He was magnificent, Federer said. He was always trailing, but he hung tough, he fought back. It almost paid off. At the end, anything could have happened. So Im very relieved.         
	Scrambling rallies twice sent Federer tumbling, while Monfils fell at least four times. Federer moved forward at every opportunity, won 49 of 64 points at the net  a lot on clay  and erased 10 of Monfils 13 break-point chances.         
	Nadal wont be so easily deterred. For the fourth consecutive year in Paris, Federer seeks to become the sixth man to have won all four Grand Slam events. Nadal defeated him in the semi-finals in 2005, and in the final in 2006 and 2007.         
	This year Nadal appears more dominant than ever. He eliminated Djokovic from the tournament for the third consecutive year and improved to 27-0 at Roland Garros.         
	Borg watched from the first row behind the baseline and rose with the rest of the crowd to applaud when Nadal completed his latest victory.         
	Unbelievable memories on this court, Nadal said. Its emotional for me every year when I come back here.         
	Nadal became the first man since Ivan Lendl in 1987 to reach four consecutive French Open finals. The result prevented Djokovic from overtaking Nadal for the No. 2 ranking.         
	Nadal repeatedly lured Djokovic into long baseline rallies and won most of them, pushing the Serb from corner to corner with his muscular groundstrokes.         
	Djokovic served poorly for much of the match and struggled to hold, facing 14 break points while Nadal faced only one in the first two sets.         
	With Nadal up two breaks in the third set at 3-0, Djokovic began to hit his groundstrokes even harder, and the high-risk tactic worked for a while. The Serb twice broke back, the second time to reach five-all, and had a set point two games later, which Nadal saved with a forehand winner.         
	The crowd roared in support of Djokovic, hoping for more tennis. But in the tie-breaker Nadal raced to a 6-0 lead. He made several saves in the final rally before leaping to hit an overhead winner, then collapsed to his back in jubilation.         
	He rose covered in the clay he loves and punched the air. A disappointed Djokovic heaved his racket to the crowd, and both players won thunderous ovations as they headed for the exit.         
	Straight sets are nothing new for Nadal, who has dropped only seven sets at Roland Garros  none in 2008. He has lost only 16 games in the past five rounds.         
	The first title of this years French Open, meanwhile, went to American Bob Bryan and Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. The third seeds beat top seeds Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) in the final on Friday.         
	This was Bryan and Azarenkas first Grand Slam tournament as a pair. He has won three US Open mixed doubles titles with other partners, in addition to five mens doubles Grand Slam titles with his twin brother Mike. Azarenka won the 2007 US Open mixed doubles championship with Max Mirnyi.

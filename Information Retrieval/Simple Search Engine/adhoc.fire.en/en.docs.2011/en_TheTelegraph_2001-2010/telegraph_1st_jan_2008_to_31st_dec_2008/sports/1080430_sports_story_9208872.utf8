The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nightmare for Knights at packed Eden
                                                                                                                                                                                                         Nightmare for Knights at packed Eden
            SUDIPTO CHOWDHURY            Sourav Ganguly and Sanath Jayasuriya at the Eden on Tuesday                           
	Calcutta: Sans the talismanic Sachin Tendulkar, Mumbai Indians still taught a veritable Twenty20 lesson to Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden on Tuesday night.         
	After having restricted Shah Rukh Khans team to 137 for eight, Dwayne Bravo hit a dazzling 64 and stitched a 113-run partnership with Robin Uthappa (37) to steer the Mumbai Indians to a seven-wicket victory  their first in five Indian Premier League encounters.         
	This was the IPLs highest fourth-wicket partnership, surpassing the 111-run stand between Andrew Symonds and Rohit Sharma in the Deccan Chargers versus Rajasthan Royals match.         
	Bravo remained unbeaten in his 53-ball knock, studded with one six and eight boundaries. His partner Uthappa, who was dropped by Debabrata Das off Ashok Dinda, was not out on 37.         
	Despite losing three quick wickets, Mumbai Indians were compact in their approach and reached the target within 18.4 overs.         
	Ajit Agarkar struck early, removing Ajinkya Rahane in the third over. Ishant Sharma got rid of Sanath Jayasuriya in the next.         
	While Rahane, trying to hit Agrakar over the mid-wicket chipped it to David Hussey, Jayasuriya nicked onto his stumps in an attempt to cut Ishant.         
	The left-hander took 10 balls for his 19, hitting three boundaries and a six.         
	Ashok Dinda knocked off Manish Pandeys middle stump for a duck, reducing the Mumbai side to 25 for three.         
	In walked Bravo and the jam-packed Eden witnessed a well-knit innings from the West Indian.         
	Even Shah Rukh Khans presence failed to make any difference and skipper Sourav Gangulys shuffling of bowlers didnt bear fruit.         
	Earlier, Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla rose to the task and helped Kolkata Knight Riders accumulate a fighting 137 for eight.         
	Shukla hit two sixes and four boundaries in his unbeaten 40 (22 balls).         
	Along with Murali Kartik, Shukla gathered 41 runs before Jayasuriya caught Kartik off Dilhara Fernando.         
	Mumbai Indians, who came into the match with four consecutive losses, again missed the services of Sachin Tendulkar who is yet to recover from a groin strain.         
	Stand-in skipper Shaun Pollock bagged two while Man-of-the-Match Jayasuriya grabbed three crucial wickets  David Hussey (17), Mohammed Hafeez (2) and Ajit Agarkar (2).         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders struggled from the outset with Pollock removing both the openers  skipper Sourav Ganguly and wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum in the very first over.         
	Sourav, after hitting a short one from Pollock, edged the next only for Jayasuriya to take a brilliant catch at first slip. First match hero McCullum was caught on the wrong foot.         
	Debabrata Das, playing his first IPL match in place of Wriddiman Saha, impressed with a 20-ball 29, hitting five boundaries and one six.         
	The Siliguri lad, in his 22-minute stay, put up a 34-run third-wicket stand with Australia captain Ricky Ponting.         
	The 22-year old Debabrata started by hitting Ashish Nehra for two consecutive boundaries and in the next over, flicked Pollock over mid-wicket for a six.         
	But he was cut short by Bravo. Intending to cut him over point, Debabratas shot went straight into the safe hands of Uthappa.         
	His partner Ponting, who did everything to regain his lost form, was run out due to a misunderstanding with Mohammed Hafeez. He managed only 19 facing 31 deliveries.

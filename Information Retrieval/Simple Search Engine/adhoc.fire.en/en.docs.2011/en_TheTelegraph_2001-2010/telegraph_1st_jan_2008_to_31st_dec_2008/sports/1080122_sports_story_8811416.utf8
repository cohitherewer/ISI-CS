                                                   Success for coach Chima

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	New Delhi: Former striker Chima Okerie tasted his maiden success as a coach on Monday when he guided New Delhi Heroes to their first Delhi League title in 50 years. 
    
	Heroes, backed by famous auctioneers Osians this season, roped in Chima to coach their team after the Nigerian was dumped by Mohun Bagan. 
    
	Talking to The Telegraph, Chima said he was happy to prove a point as a coach. In Calcutta, I was not given enough time to do the job. Here I had the whole season with me. I could give a shape to the young side. 
    
	Impressed by his teams efforts, All India Football Federation (AIFF) has extended them an invitation to play in the Second Division I-League beginning in March. 
    
	With little fine-tuning of the team and addition of a few players, I can take my team to the Premier Division, Chima said. 
    
	Believe me, I am not missing Calcutta, said the six-time Calcutta league top-scorer. Here I can work peacefully. In Calcutta, they think they know everything. They dont want to learn. Thats the reason why the Calcutta teams are on the decline at the moment. 
    
	Asked whether he would like to return to the eastern metropolis, Chima thought for a moment and then said: Not immediately. I have a dream to fulfil with New Delhi Heroes.

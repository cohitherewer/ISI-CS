                                                   Sourav: Generally, I believe   that the best is yet to come
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL
  - I wasnt left out (of the tri-series) because of a lack of form         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                  Sourav Ganguly      
	Chennai: Sourav Ganguly is a few months short of his 36th birthday but the hunger for runs hasnt gone. He remains passionate too. On Tuesday, hours before the start of a fresh Test series, Sourav spoke to The Telegraph at the Taj Connemara.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q The last India-South Africa series had seen your international comeback. Your thoughts on the eve of another face-off against South Africa?         
	A I wont be trying to do anything different Ill try and keep things simple, which I believe is the best way forward Except the last two Tests in Australia, Ive been among the runs ever since that comeback at the Wanderers and Ill again be looking to contribute         
	Were there nerves on the morning of December 15, 2006, the first day of that series?         
	I was a bit tense but also pretty excited For whatever reason, I hadnt got an opportunity (in Tests) for 10 months and, so, it was great getting back I had the confidence to deliver and the 80-odd in the first innings of the warm-up game in Potchefstroom made me even more confident Id, of course, never for a moment lost the belief that I could prove I was good enough for the highest level.         
	Who made you feel most comfortable in the dressing room?         
	Most of the players I didnt feel awkward.         
	And Greg Chappell?         
	That bit is over I wouldnt like to keep talking about that period.         
	We lost quite a few wickets early on and, so, you were quickly in the thick of action (110 for four in the 42nd over) at the Wanderers         
	The situation didnt weigh me down Its just that despite being good enough, I hadnt been getting opportunities.         
	How long did it take you to actually settle down?         
	(Grins) No time at all Dont forget Id been around for a decade         
	You top scored with an unbeaten 51 in the first innings. Because of the circumstances, do you see that as one of your finest knocks?         
	One of the most meaningful and one which I wont forget         
	Today, how do you look back on the past 16 months or so?         
	With a lot of satisfaction. In this period, Ive scored 2,600 runs (1,360 of them coming in the oldest form, average of 50-plus) in Tests and ODIs Very satisfying indeed Talking of Tests, Ive played a number of innings, be it at the Wanderers or at Trent Bridge Or even at the Kotla (against Pakistan) Ive contributed when the team needed something substantial to force a win Also, dont forget the double hundred in Bangalore and the runs in Melbourne and Sydney.         
	Anything youve learnt in this period?         
	Not just in this period but, generally, that you never know whats in store Generally, I believe that the best is yet to come I believe that tomorrow could be an even better day This belief has been the driving force in my life (After a pause) This belief has come from experience There have, for example, been times when I havent played well and wondered whether Ill be able to so the next day or in the next innings Ive actually gone on to do so.         
	What about the time you were out of Team India?         
	What I learnt then is that theres more to life than cricket That realisation allowed me to play with freedom Took the pressure off me         
	To talk of the last Test series, in Australia         
	(Interrupting) I dont want to harp on the Sydney Test, but we couldve won  or, at least  drawn there and the result wouldve been different The 2003-04 (drawn) series in Australia is seen as a defining moment, but the last one was no different... We lost 1-2, but our win came in Perth For me, thats the greatest Indian victory A team from the sub-continent winning at the Waca inside four days Its right at the top for me.         
	If Perths at the top, the other 2 in your top 3 would be         
	Beating England at Headingley (2002) and defeating Australia at the Eden (2001).         
	What about our tri-series success in Australia?         
	A great win The way Sachin (Tendulkar) batted in both finals was awesome The way our bowlers bowled was great Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar, Irfan Pathan All in fact         
	Are you hopeful of making another ODI comeback?         
	Oh yes, absolutely Ive been the best one-day player, after Sachin, for a long time I know I wasnt left out (of the tri-series) because of a lack of form.         
	Team Indias ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni felt a bit uncomfortable on meeting you (Chennai airport, on Saturday) for the first time after the tri-series         
	He didnt have to feel uncomfortable Whether Im in the one-day team or not, my relationship with Dhoni (who made his India debut under him) will not change My good wishes will always be with him.         
	Your impressions of him as a captain?         
	Its early days for him but hes given the results Weve won the World Twenty20, then the ODI series at home against Pakistan and the tri-series in Australia Hes young and, so, his way of handling things is bound to be different from that of Anil (Kumble)         
	This senior-junior/young-old business has been doing the rounds for some time         
	Wouldnt like to get into it.         
	How is Kumble, the Test captain?         
	Anils been fantastic One sign of a good captain is when he keeps faith in his players If you look at the squad for the first Test, it has some who had a poor series in Australia They didnt get dropped Anil, obviously, believes that if somebody has ability then he has to be backed.         
	Given that youre Indias most successful Test captain, have the two of you ever had a chat exclusively on captaincy?         
	No But whenever Ive felt an idea needed to be given, Ive done that Anils open to ideas but I realise that hes the captain and does need space to operate Moreover, as captain, he has his views and thoughts.         
	You lost the captaincy in October 2005 Do you miss the hot seat?         
	(Laughs) No No         
	The South Africans may prove to be formidable opponents How do you rate Graeme Smiths team?         
	Its a good side, with a good bowling unit Jacques Kallis, Smith himself They have the ability to make a difference I know South Africa beat Pakistan in Pakistan, but theyll find us much tougher.         
	What do we need to do?         
	Bat well and put big runs on the board         
	Win the toss too         
	Not necessary One shouldnt worry about the toss and one shouldnt put everything in the toss-basket Remember, Id lost the toss at the Eden in the last India-South Africa Test at home (2004-05), but we still won.         
	The last one: Any goals for the series?         
	Hope to do well Hope we win Thats it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir, Ojha in reckoning
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gambhir, Ojha in reckoning
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir is likely to be rewarded for his fine form in one-day cricket when the national selectors meet in Mumbai to pick the squad for the three-Test series in Sri Lanka starting later this month.         
	Wasim Jaffer, Virender Sehwags opening partner in Tests, hasnt been in good form in the last couple of series against Australia and South Africa. In Australia, Jaffer managed 49 in three Tests and 126 in as many matches at home against the Proteas.         
	The selectors are also likely to pick a second wicketkeeper. Dinesh Karthik seems the obvious choice, but Parthiv Patel cannot be ruled out.         
	Sachin Tendulkar will be back along with Harbhajan Singh. Sachin was forced to take a break because of a groin injury while the off-spinner had been serving a ban because of slapping Sreesanth during the Indian Premier League.         
	There has been no official communication to the selectors or secretary Niranjan Shah on Sachins fitness but it is assumed that he is available for the series.         
	Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Yuvraj Singh pick themselves.         
	There is a cloud over Zaheer Khans fitness and Dilip Vengsarkar has admitted to being in the dark. The pacer has been out with a heel injury since the first Test in Australia last year. It is also learnt that Sreesanth has been advised another three weeks rest. Irfan Pathan has also failed to enthuse the selectors with his performance in Pakistan.         
	Munaf Patel is set for a comeback in the circumstances. Ishant Sharma, VRV Singh and Rudra Pratap Singh are likely to form the quartet.         
	Pragyan Ojha is a frontrunner for the third spinners slot ahead of Murali Kartik. .         
	Young Gujarat offie Mohnish Parmar has emerged as the dark horse after having impressed the selectors during the domestic season.         
	The selectors will also pick a pool of 30 players for the Champions Trophy. It is likely that Sourav and Dravid will be included among the probables.

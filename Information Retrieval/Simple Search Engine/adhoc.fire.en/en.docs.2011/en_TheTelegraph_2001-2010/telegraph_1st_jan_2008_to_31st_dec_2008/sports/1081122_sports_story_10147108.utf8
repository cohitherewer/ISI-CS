            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A1 Team India had a solid start to the third round of A1GP World Cup of Motor Sport at Sepang, Malaysia with Armaan Ebrahim finishing third in his first rookie session in their new Ferrari-powered car on Friday.         
	Narain Karthikeyan too finished third in the lead driver practice session, according to a news release.         
	Armaan finished fourteen laps with his quickest lap time at 1:52.739 behind Nicolas Prost of Team France coming second and Danny Watts from Team Great Britain taking pole position with a fastest lap time of 1:51.096.         
	The first rookie session was far more successful than the second where the temperature of the engine rose sharply.

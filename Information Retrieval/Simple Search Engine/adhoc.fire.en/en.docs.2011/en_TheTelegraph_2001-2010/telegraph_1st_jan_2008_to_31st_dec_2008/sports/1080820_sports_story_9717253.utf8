	Beijing, Aug 19(AP): Police detained five American activists Tuesday after they unfurled a quot;free Tibet quot; banner near a key Olympics venue in Beijing, according to a pro-Tibet group.         
	An American graffiti artist, who planned to use laser beams to flash the same message on buildings in the Chinese capital, was also detained, according to a colleague and Students for a Free Tibet.         
	The five protesters were taken away by security shortly before midnight for displaying the banner, which outlined quot;free Tibet quot; in English and Chinese with tiny blue diodes, near the Beijing National Stadium, the group said in a statement.         
	A spokesman in the news department of Beijings Municipal Publicity Security Bureau said he was not aware of the protest. He gave only his surname, Li, as is common among officials in China because they are not allowed to discuss sensitive issues with the media.         
	Earlier in the day, James Powderly, co-founder of Graffiti Research Lab in New York, was also detained as he prepared to use a handheld green laser to project messages on prominent structures in Beijing.         
	Powderlys colleague, Nathan Dorjee, said in New York that he received a text message from the artist which said he had been detained around 3 a.m. by police.         
	 quot;He was going to project a message that said, Free Tibet, and some other messages that would have been three-stories high in different locations in Beijing, quot; Dorjee said.         
	Li declined to comment on Powderlys case.         
	The protests are only the latest instances in which foreign activists were detained after seeking to use the Olympic Games to criticize China for its rule in Tibet, alleging human rights abuses and religious restrictions. Other foreign demonstrators, many of whom also tried to hang quot;Free Tibet quot; banners in Beijing, have been quickly picked up and deported.         
	 quot;The Chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of Tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the Tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to Chinas occupation of Tibet, quot; said Tenzin Dorjee, Deputy Director of Students for a Free Tibet in a statement.         
	China maintains that the Himalayan region has been part of its territory for centuries, while many Tibetans insist they were an independent nation before communist troops invaded in 1950.         
	Powderly is a well-known New York graffiti artist who projects laser beam quot;tag quot; messages onto iconic skyscrapers and other notable structures such as the Brooklyn Bridge. His messages are typically political and often promote freedom of speech and expression.

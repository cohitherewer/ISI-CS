The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mikadze holds Harika
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mikadze holds Harika
                      
	Gaziantep (Turkey): Top seed international master D. Harika was held to a draw by Miranda Mikadze of Georgia while Ukrainian Mariya Muzychuk scored a lucky victory over Soumya Swaminathan in the 10th round of the ongoing world junior girls chess championship.         
	With just three rounds to go in the premier girls event, Mariya joined Harika in lead on 8 points out of a possible 10. Even as the tie-breaker favours Harika hugely thanks to her rocking start, it seems more like a race between these two for the title.         
	Harika decided against pressing hard against Mikadze, who has made a fine comeback here. Playing black, Harika stayed focused to equalise and signed peace in quick time.         
	Mariya was simply lucky as Soumya Swaminathan blundered away a promising position. Playing black, Soumya apparently was in control with a dangerous looking king side attack when disaster struck and she left one of her bishop without compensation.         
	In the world juniors being held simultaneously, the lead positions changed hands once again as Maxim Rodshtein of Israel shot in to sole lead after beating over night leader Arik Braun of Germany.         
	While Rodshtein took his tally to 8 points, so Wesley of Philippines and Braun remained on his heels a half point behind.         
	The Indian duo of Parimarjan Negi and Abhijeet Gupta remained in medal contention with victories over Sergei Zhigalko of Belarus and Tornike Sanikidze of Georgia respectively. Both Parimarjan and Abhijeet took their tally to 7 points.

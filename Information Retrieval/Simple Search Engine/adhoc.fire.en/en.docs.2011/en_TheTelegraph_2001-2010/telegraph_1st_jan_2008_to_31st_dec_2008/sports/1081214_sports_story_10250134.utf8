	London: Premier League leaders Liverpool stumbled at home again on Saturday and needed two Steven Gerrard goals to salvage a 2-2 draw with Hull City.         
	Liverpool fluffed the opportunity to open a four-point gap on second-placed Chelsea and it could have been even worse after they trailed 2-0 in the 22nd minute, the second Hull effort an own goal by Jamie Carragher.         
	Instead of cementing their place, Rafa Benitezs side will be knocked off their perch if Chelsea beat West Ham United at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.         
	Arsenals title hopes were dealt a blow after a 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough, former Gunners striker Jeremie Aliadiere equalising Emmanuel Adebayors opener.         
	Aston Villa moved above Arsenal into fourth spot thanks to a 4-2 home win over Bolton Wanderers, Gabriel Agbonlahor scoring twice for Martin Neills men.         
	Liverpool have 38 points from 17 games, Chelsea have 36 from 16 with United on 31 from 15. Villa also have 31 points.         
	Sunderland moved out of the bottom three with a 4-0 romp at home to bottom club West Bromwich Albion, who appear to be plunging towards a quick return to the Championship (second division).         
	Sunderland have 18 points, the same as big-spending Manchester City who were beaten 1-0 at home by Everton to leave manager Mark Hughes under pressure.         
	Blackburn Rovers were thumped 3-0 at Wigan Athletic while Stoke City and Fulham ended goalless.         
	Liverpool have drawn at home to Stoke City, Fulham, West Ham and Hull this season, a trend threatening to derail hopes of their first top-flight title since 1989-90.         
	There was stunned silence at Anfield when Paul McShane headed in Marlon Kings cross and then Carragher turned Bernard Mendys centre into his own net.         
	Gerrard, so often Liverpools saviour, single-handedly brought his team level with two rasping shots in the space of eight minutes before halftime.         
	It seemed likely Liverpool would go on to claim victory but they appeared to run out of ideas after the break in the absence of the injured Fernando Torres.

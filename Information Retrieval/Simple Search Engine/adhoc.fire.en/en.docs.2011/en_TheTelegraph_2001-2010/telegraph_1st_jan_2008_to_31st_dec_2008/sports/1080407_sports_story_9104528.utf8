                                                                                                                                                                                                       Smith equals Cronje record
            A STAFF REPORTER            Graeme Smith                           
	Calcutta: Having led his team to South Africas biggest-ever winning margin over India, Graeme Smith joined former captain, the late Hansie Cronje, as the South Africas most successful Test captain.         
	This equals the record of Cronje who was the winning captain in 27 of his 53 matches as captain. Smith has now captained South Africa on 56 occasions for 27 wins, 15 losses and 14 draws, stated a CSA release on Sunday.         
	There was some additional reasons to rejoice for coach Micky Arthur.         
	Arthur has now completed 28 matches in charge of the South Africa and has a 50 per cent success ratio  winning side in 14 of them.         
	Among the individual records set here was the fifth-wicket partnership of 256 between Jacques Kallis (132) and A B de Villiers (217 not out) which has become the highest by South Africans for any wicket against India.         
	Pace bowler Dale Steyn, who played a major role in the stunning victory by taking eight wickets in the match to the four taken in the drawn series opener in Chennai, took his tally in the subcontinent to 35 from six Tests.         
	He has a total of 75 wickets from the last 11 Tests, which includes two 10-wicket feats.

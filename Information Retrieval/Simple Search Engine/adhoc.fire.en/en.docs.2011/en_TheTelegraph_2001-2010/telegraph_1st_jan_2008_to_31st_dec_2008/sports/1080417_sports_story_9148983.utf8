The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj sounds war cry against Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yuvraj sounds war cry against Dhoni
                                      Dhoni and Yuvraj      
	 Mohali: Mahendra Singh Dhoni may be his good pal in the dressing room, but Yuvraj Singh has declared war against him ahead of their Indian Premier League encounter. The Kings XI captain, after all, will have pride at stake before the home crowd.         
	There is no friendship on the field. We will want to win the game and have an upper hand in the competition, said Yuvraj as his and Dhonis team, Chennai Super Kings, gear up for their opening match on Saturday.         
	Its a good way to build the hype (around the competition) by pitching it as Yuvraj-versus-Dhoni contest. Maybe, I will share a joke with him after the game, added Yuvraj.         
	Dressed in a white T-shirt and cargos, Yuvraj, who reached here in his yellow sports car, was brimming with confidence and looked excited about the Twenty20 championship.         
	I am happy with the team composition. Its a good mix of youngsters and senior players. We have an equally good bowling attack to put any team under pressure, he said.         
	Yuvraj, who hit six sixes in one over in the ICC World Twenty20 last year, said he could repeat the feat in the upcoming competition. Anything can happen in cricket, you never know, though I feel such things happen once in a lifetime, he said.         
	According to him, its an excellent platform for youngsters to learn from international players. I am sure it is going to pick up and will be a success.         
	The Kings XI coach Tom Moody said he would like to see his team start winning from the first match itself.         
	Asked to comment on Lee leaving after playing a few matches to attend his national duties, Moody said: We are lucky to have him in our side, but replacements will be filled up by the right players. We have the whole squad and there is nothing to worry. (PTI)

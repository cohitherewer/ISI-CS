	Calcutta: Serious preparations are afoot at RCTC for the January 1 races. Horses have resumed fast work from Wednesday after 10 days of trots and canters. The clubs officials are, however, tight-lipped about the start of the winter season, while members are, sanguine about the New Years Day races. The prospectus is out, asking for entries early next week said a member who did not want to be identified. The season could not be started on time because of the equine flu.

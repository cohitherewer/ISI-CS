The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev is back in top 50
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev is back in top 50
            EIGHTH COLUMN                                  Jeev Milkha Singh            
	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh is back among the elites again with the latest world rankings putting the Indian pro at 46th place after his sensational triumph in the Singapore Open.         
	Jeev claimed a thrilling one-stroke victory over multiple Major winners Padraig Harrington and Ernie Els at the Singapore Open on the Asian Tour on Sunday.         
	The Chandigarh-pro went to the last hole with a one-stroke lead and his par was enough for the win as Harrington and Els missed good birdie chances on the 18th. As a result of his triumph, which also virtually assured him the Asian Tour Order of Merit title, Jeev leapfrogged 14 spots to world No. 46.         
	Jeev pocketed $792,500 for his exploits in Singapore, making him the first golfer to earn more than $1m on the Asian Tour.         
	Meanwhile, compatriot Jyoti Randhawa, who is grappling with poor form for quite a while, continues to slip down the ladder and was placed 144th in Mondays rankings.         
	US-based Arjun Atwal, who has secured his PGA Tour card for the next season, is ranked 192nd after failing to make the cut in the Singapore Open.         
	The next Indian on the charts is Calcutta-pro S.S.P. Chowrasia, who is way behind at 305th.         
	Meanwhile, heaping praise on the Indian for his mind-boggling success this season, Asian Tours executive chairman Kyi Hla Han said Jeevs success story would inspire the youth in the continent and he tipped the Indian to corner greater glory in times to come.         
	The victory (in Singapore) cemented Jeevs stature as a truly world-class player and the manner in which he won at Sentosa underlined his growing credentials in the world of golf, Han said.         
	Over the years, Jeev has been a wonderful ambassador for the Asian Tour, winning titles in Europe and Japan this year as well. Through the Asian Tour, Jeev has grown to become a terrific player and I am convinced he will go on to win many other big championships and also contend and win Major events in the years to come, he added.         
	We are absolutely thrilled to welcome Jeev as our first million-dollar man in a single season on the Asian Tour. Part of our mission is to create greater playing opportunities for our members and through this historic landmark, it reinforces the strength of the game in Asia.         
	I am convinced that Jeevs success will inspire other young players across Asia to emulate his success, said Han.

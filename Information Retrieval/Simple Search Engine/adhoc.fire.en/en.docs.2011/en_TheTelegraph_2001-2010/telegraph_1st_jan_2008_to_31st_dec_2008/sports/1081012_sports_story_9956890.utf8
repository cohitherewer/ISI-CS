The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Oram shines in NZ victory
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oram shines in NZ victory
                  Jacob Oram in Dhaka on Saturday                     
	Dhaka: Allrounder Jacob Oram shone with both the bat and ball to help New Zealand beat Bangladesh by 75 runs in the second one-day international here on Saturday and level the three-match series 1-1.         
	The dashing left-hander hit an unbeaten 75 to lift New Zealand to a fighting 212 for nine in 50 overs before taking two for 23 to dismiss the home team for 137 in 42.4 overs.         
	New Zealand, who lost a one-day international against Bangladesh for the first time when they went down in the first match by seven wickets here on Thursday, picked up in all three departments, with Oram leading the way.         
	Bangladeshs hopes for a repeat of their stunning win were dashed as they lost wickets at regular intervals after losing opener Tamim Iqbal off the second ball of the innings.         
	Skipper Mohammad Ashraful (40) and Zunaed Siddique (32) were the main run-getters.         
	Iqbal was one of Kyle Mills three victims as the paceman checked Bangladeshs run-chase from the outset. Mills finished with three for 13.         
	Zunaed Siddique, who hit a match-winning 85 on Thursday, then added 53 for the third wicket with Ashraful before New Zealand bowled and fielded well to spark a middle-order collapse which saw the home team lose eight wickets for 66 runs.         
	Oram dismissed a dangerous looking Ashraful to seal the fate of the match.           (AFP)

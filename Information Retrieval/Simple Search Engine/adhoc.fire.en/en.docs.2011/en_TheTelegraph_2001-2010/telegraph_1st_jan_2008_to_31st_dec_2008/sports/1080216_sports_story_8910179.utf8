                                                     Ponting amp; Co. up for award
                              
	 World champions Australia will have to fend off a tough challenge from the Iraqi football team who won the AFC Asian Cup for the Team Of The Year title in the Laureus world sports awards.         
	Ricky Pontings team had a successful past year having equalled a record feat of 16 consecutive Test victories but pitted against a group of footballers who have overcome war and security threats, the judges would face a tough choice in St Petersburg Monday.         
	Steve Waugh, who was captain of Australia when they won the award in 2002, sits on the 43-member Laureus Academy, a panel of sporting legends who choose the winners.         
	The Australian cricket team had an outstanding year, theyve a pretty good chance of taking that one, Waugh told The Australian. The Iraq football team would also have some aspirations to win that for what they achieved in difficult circumstances to win the Asian Cup, he added.               
	Buchanan aim         
	 Former Australian coach John Buchanan said he would want a more diversified role if he was to coach a franchise team in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Buchanan, who had claimed he would not coach at international level, told Herald Sun: If I was to sign with a franchise, I would need to know that I was employed to do more than just coach a team.         
	I would like to utilise my skills of building something unique, special and sustainable in the long-term         
	Perfect time         
	 All set to take over as coach of the Mohali team in the IPL Twenty20, former Sri Lankan coach Tom Moody said the offer has come at a perfect time for him.         
	Obviously the timing of it is pretty perfect in regard to my responsibilities with western Australia, Moody told The Australian. Thats all happening over the next few days. Its all a bit loose at the moment whether its in regard to management or players. Moody is among four Australians who have been short-listed to coach one each of the eight franchisee teams for the Twenty20 tournament beginning April 18.

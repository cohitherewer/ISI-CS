            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is in the dark about the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) technical committees decision to allow state associations to add a foreigner to their Ranji squads for the forthcoming season.         
	We have heard about this decision of the BCCI. But we have no idea how can this be done. We havent received any mail from the board, a senior CAB official said.         
	We have got only two days left to decide on this. They announced this today (Saturday) and its impossible to decide on anything important so quickly, the official said.         
	According to him, for hiring a foreigner, the CAB will require a nod from its working committee and there is very little time to go through the process.         
	This is a lengthy process. We need to select the players and then need to decide on the contract Thats something the working committee will decide, he said.

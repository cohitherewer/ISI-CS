                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indian men in 2nd spot
            ARCHERY WORLD CUP      A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Led by a career-best performance by Mangal Singh Champia, Indian men stood overall second in the Fita round recurve qualification of the third Metesksan World Cup at Antalya on Wednesday.         
	Champia finished first, scoring a career-best 684 points over two 70m rounds of the Fita event, in a very strong field that included Koreans.         
	The Indian was tied with Korean archer Park Kyung Mo at 684, but Champias higher number of 10 pointers  41 against 37 by Park  earned him the top place which ensured his passage into the individual competition as the top seed.         
	He, however, fell four points short of the existing 72-arrow world record of Korean Im Dong Hyuns mark of 687 set at the Athens Olympics four years back.         
	Buoyed by stellar performances from Jayanta Talukdar (678, 4th) and Rahul Banerjee (673, 8th), apart from Champia, the Indian mens team took the second slot behind Korea with a score of 2035 points.         
	Koreas total of 2039 broke the world record of 2031 set by the Korean team at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.         
	The mood in the Indian camp was greatly dampened by depressing performance by the women archers. Ace archer Dola Banerjee finished way below at 67th with a total of 591. Only the first 84 qualify for the individual competition out of 100 in fray.         
	However, Reena Kumari, Punya Prabha and Laishram Bombayla Devi made the cut for the womens individual main competition. Reena finished 28th with a total of 625 points. Punya Prabha, the fourth archer, stood at 46th with 608 while Bombayla Devi ended 49th with 604.         
	The Indian womens team, comprising Dola, Reena and Bombayla, scored 1820 points to occupy the 13th place.

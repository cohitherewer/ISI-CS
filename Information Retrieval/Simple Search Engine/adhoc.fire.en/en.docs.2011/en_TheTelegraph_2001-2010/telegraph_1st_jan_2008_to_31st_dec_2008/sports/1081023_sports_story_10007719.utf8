	Cuttack: Confusion prevailed as to who was in charge of the India Red a day before they are to open their campaign against India Blue in the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy tournament here at Barabati Stadium.         
	Praveen Amre was appointed coach of the India Red team by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) but the former India player said he had not received any communication. I am not aware of this... I have not been approached by the BCCI. Moreover, the Ranji season is beginning soon (November 3) and I am busy with my team (Mumbai).         
	India Red captain Subramaniam Badrinath was also clueless about the issue.         
	When contacted, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan reiterated that Amre was the coach. Minutes later, Amre informed that he would be reaching here Thursday morning.

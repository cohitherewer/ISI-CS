The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England owe it to India: Hussain
                                                                                                                                                                                                     England owe it to India: Hussain
                      
	London: Urging the English cricket team to return to India for next weeks Test series, former England captain Nasser Hussain said by doing so Kevin Pietersen and his men can help the hosts limp back to normalcy after the Mumbai terror strikes.         
	Englands cricketers owe it to the game, and to India, to go back, Hussain said in his column. I respect the England team for coming home and taking stock after last weeks terrible events. Yet, easy as it is for me to say this sitting here in Chelmsford, my gut feeling is that the England team should announce they are going back to play two Tests in India and fulfil their commitment to this tour and the world game, he said.         
	Eventually, the game has to go on, just as people in London had to get back on tubes and buses after the 2005 bomb attacks. As long as the security people say it is as safe as it can be to return and as long as the Indian people want the tour to continue, England can make a statement by going back. And if I was asked to go there next week in my capacity as a journalist and broadcaster I would go.

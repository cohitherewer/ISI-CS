The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Neil: We need another 140
                                                   Neil: We need another 140
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Neil McKenzie is disappointed at missing out on his second consecutive hundred but is happy with the way he batted on the opening day of the first Test. At the post match press conference, the opener said another 100-140 runs were needed to put India under pressure.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	The wicket         
	It was about getting in and settling down. There was more bounce than one expected. But overall it seems a nice track.         
	His conversion from a middle-order batsman to an opener         
	I think that if there is one place you want to bat in the subcontinent it is the opening slot I have seen it in a positive way. Its my responsibility to see the new ball away. I am 32 and want to enjoy my cricket. Wherever the team wants me to bat I want to give 100 per cent.         
	Getting dropped from the side         
	I played for five years when I was 23 and after that I was left out for few years. I love playing for South Africa and would like to play for another couple of years but I am not taking anything for granted. I try to play every Test as if its my last.         
	The superstitions he followed (to cover his bat with a blanket and put it to sleep the night before he batted)         
	I had certain rituals and habits which I followed before I batted but now I have a wife and a kid and there are others things to think about.         
	Missing out on a hundred         
	Test cricketers are really greedy At the start of the day I would have taken 90 gladly but its never enough. Im happy to get runs but very disappointed that I missed out on a Test hundred.         
	His expertise against spin         
	I have been around Ive played against a few of the best spinners. Obviously there are world-class spinners here but I think its down to experience. There are footages and analyses that go along You pick quite a few things along the way and with your teammates. But quality bowlers can knock you down any moment.         
	The teams target         
	Theres been no discussion, but I feel we still have to get another 100-140 runs to make an impact. Anything above that will be a bonus. Hashim (Amla) has been batting well and theres AB (de Villiers). Mark Boucher will follow. We should do well. Hopefully the wicket will stay as bouncy as today Dale Steyn and Morkel can prove to be effective and we can grab a few early wickets.

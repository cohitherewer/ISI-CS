Van den Hoogenband retires | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Van den Hoogenband retires
                      
	Beijing, Aug 14 (AP): Pieter van den Hoogenband announced his retirement Thursday after Alain Bernard took away his chance at an unprecedented third straight victory in swimmings signature race, the 100-meter freestyle.         
	Way too fast. Its a new generation, and its now time to step aside, quot; Van den Hoogenband said. They did a great job. Im from the previous generation with Alex Popov         
	Popov won the 100 free in 1992 and 1996 and Van den Hoogenband took the two-lap race at the 2000 Sydney and 2004 Athens Games. The Dutchmans world record of 47.84 seconds set in Sydney stood for eight years before Bernard bettered it twice in one day at the European Championships in March.         
	Bernard and Australian speedster Eamon Sullivan improved the mark three more times at these games, and Sullivans record of 47.05 still stood after a tactical final.         
	Bernard won in 47.21, Sullivan touched second in 47.32 and Jason Lezak of the United States took the bronze in 47.67. Van den Hoogenband finished fifth in 47.75.         
	This is my last race, the 30-year-old Van den Hoogenband said. quot;Ive raced many times against Alain, but I didnt know he was in my (league). We met before the races and hes a great guy and we have a good (relationship). Im very happy with an ambassador like Alain. Hes a great sportsman. Van den Hoogenband also won the 200 free in Sydney and he retires with three Olympic golds, two silvers and two bronzes.         
	Its been a very long time, my fourth Olympics, my fourth final in the 100 freestyle, quot; he said. quot;The Olympics is very special to me. When I was 10 years old watching Seoul, watching Matt Biondi, I got really inspired. quot;         
	Van den Hoogenband always kept his best for the Olympics. He never won gold at a world championships, taking eight silvers and two bronzes.         
	He missed the 2005 worlds due to a hernia operation and withdrew from the European Championships in March at his home pool in Eindhoven due to a virus.         
	I thought maybe it was possible to make history and win three times in a row, but in 2005 I got really set back, and started from zero, quot; he said.         
	After eight long years and swimming three times in a row 47 seconds, this is under my best I did in Sydney. Its a big achievement for me personally. Im realizing it now, because a few minutes ago I was very, very disappointed, because I was close to the bronze. Its weird, but I was only thinking about ways to win the race, and that was impossible with guys like Eamon and Bernard. quot;         
	Van den Hoogenband studied medicine, but hes not sure what hell do in the future. First off, hell spend more time with his wife, Minouche, and daughter Daphne.         
	I dont know, quot; he said, receiving a pat on the shoulder from Bernard. quot;Im going to take my rest now. I deserve my rest.         
	With that, the Dutchman turned around, walked behind Bernard facing a hoard of French media, and into the locker room to remove his swimsuit.

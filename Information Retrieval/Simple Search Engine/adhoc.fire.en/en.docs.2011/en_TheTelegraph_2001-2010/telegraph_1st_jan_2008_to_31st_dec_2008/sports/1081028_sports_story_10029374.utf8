The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | If fit, Kumble will play the 3rd Test: Kirsten
                                                                                                                                                                                                       If fit, Kumble will play the 3rd Test: Kirsten
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Gary Kirsten                           
	New Delhi: India coach Gary Kirsten on Monday ruled out the possibility of going into the third Test against Australia with three spinners. Talking to the media at the end of the two-hour training session at the Kotla, Kirsten said: There is no possibility of playing three spinners. I would like to go into a Test with six batsmen.         
	Kirsten also said that captain Anil Kumble, if fit, will play the third Test.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Harbhajan Singhs injury         
	A Im not sure, to be honest. Weve to wait and see Hopefully its not too serious, we are not sure at the moment. I think he picked it up towards the end of the last game. We are hopeful that he would be ready for this Test.         
	If Anil Kumble would be back         
	If Kumble is fit, he is the captain of the team... Hell play the next match I expect. He is looking good, so we are happy with the way things have progressed.         
	The verbal duel that was seen on the field in Mohali         
	I think two very competitive, emotional and aggressive teams are playing this series. I think there will always be occasions in pressure situations when either team might overstep the mark a little bit. Zaheer (Khan) had admitted at the match referees meeting that he overstepped the mark. That can happen... They are trying to produce high level of cricket that creates great excitement in Test cricket.         
	We must encourage it. We obviously understand individuals must not overstep the mark.         
	Is Zaheer emotionally vulnerable         
	I dont think he is emotionally vulnerable. He is an exceptionally talented bowler and a great performer for India. He has certainly produced the goods.         
	On the impact Zaheer and Ishant (Sharma) are going to make in this Test         
	Theyve bowled exceptionally well so far. I mean its a very exciting time for Indian cricket with two fast bowlers having such an impact in a Test series. We need our fast bowlers to be the strikers... And with two more Test matches to go, we would like that trend to continue.         
	On Ishant, I must say that I was impressed the first time I saw him in Perth. He loves Test cricket. He does not want to bowl just five overs. He wants to bowl 25 overs a day. Hes mentally strong, a great find and a great asset for Indian cricket and I think our challenge is to manage him carefully over the next few years so that he continues to perform well for India.         
	If India will be under pressure as the Australians are saying         
	Im not really concerned about what the Aussies say. All I know is that they would be well-prepared. They are a highly competitive team. Thats the way they are... We will be giving everything to win this Test match. We are not expecting any freebies in the next match.         
	How important is reverse swing in Test cricket         
	Its an important component of Test match cricket these days. We certainly have got two seamers who are using it effectively. We would love to continue like that.

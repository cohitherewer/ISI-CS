                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kapil slams official for dividing game
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Kapil Dev                           
	New Delhi: Former India captain Kapil Dev on Tuesday took a swipe at an important BCCI official, saying that the cricket world would be divided because of one man.         
	The chairman of the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL), speaking during the function to launch the Dhaka Warriors team, said: There is one man who will be responsible for dividing the cricket world.         
	When asked to name the person, the legendary cricketer said: I dont want to name him. You all know who I am talking about.         
	Kapil said he was pained at some of the ICL players being denied their pension. Are players who have signed with the ICL untouchables? Why deny what is due to them, said Kapil.         
	The four Bangladesh players present at the function said they were happy to be part of the ICL.         
	We have come in search of some good cricket. Money was never the issue. Cricket has been a passion for us, said Diman Ghosh, one of the four players.         
	Former Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar, Alok Kapali and Shahriar Nafees were also presented as part of the Dhaka Warriors.         
	We are not traitors. We have come to play cricket and I know ICL can make the youngsters better cricketers, said Bashar. Two other cricketers expected to join Bashar and Co. are Aftab Ahmad and Farhat Raza.         
	The ICLs second edition will begin on October 10 with matches scheduled to be held at Punchkula, Hyderabad, Gurgaon and Ahmedabad. The ICL World Series will follow at the same venues from November 20.         
	The ICL is part and parcel of Indian cricket now, said Kiran More.

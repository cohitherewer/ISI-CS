The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dilshan, Silva boost Lanka
                                                   Dilshan, Silva boost Lanka
                      
	Port of Spain: Tillekeratne Dilshan and Chamara Silva added exactly 100 for the sixth wicket to boost Sri Lanka to 217 for five at the close of the first day of the second Test against West Indies on Thursday.         
	After fast bowlers Fidel Edwards and Jerome Taylor had reduced the Sri Lankans to 117 for five, Dilshan (58 not out) and Silva (37 not out) posted their century stand from just 101 balls.         
	Only 46.3 overs were possible on a rain-interrupted day after Chris Gayle had won the toss and asked Sri Lanka to bat. An aggressive Edwards, giving one of his best displays at Test level, claimed the wickets of Malinda Warnapura (35) and Kumar Sangakkara (10) to reduce Sri Lanka to 89 for two at lunch.         
	Two lengthy rain delays meant that only 12.2 overs were bowled in the afternoon session but that was enough for West Indies to claim three victims, including Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene (26) for only 50 runs.         
	Overcast conditions helped provide Edwards and Taylor with some swing but both also extracted some movement off the seam as they produced a rare spell of old-school Caribbean pace bowling.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib still confident of contract
                                                     Shoaib still confident of contract
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Shoaib Akhtar                           
	Calcutta/Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar Friday said he was confident of winning back a contract with the PCB. The fast bowler is hoping that thisll be achieved over the next few days.         
	Shoaibs comments came amid reports that he had been dropped from a domestic tournament in Pakistan on disciplinary grounds after being accused of having a negative influence in the dressing room.         
	My absolute priority in my cricket career has always been to take wickets for Pakistan and help my country win matches. I am hopeful of entering a new contract with my board very soon, Shoaib said in a media release.         
	Shoaibs fitness was on trial when he led the Federal Areas team against Punjab in a Pentangular Cup match in Lahore this week.         
	After going wicketless in 18 overs on a batting pitch, he criticised the PCB for the arrangements.         
	Already facing disciplinary action for an earlier statement in which he accused the PCB of double standards and a dual policy towards players, Shoaib has now been dropped from the Federal Areas team.

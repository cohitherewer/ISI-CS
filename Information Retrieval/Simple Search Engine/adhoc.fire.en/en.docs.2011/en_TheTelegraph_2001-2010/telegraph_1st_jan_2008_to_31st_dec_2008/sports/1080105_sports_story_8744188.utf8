	New Delhi: The AIFF finally took a positive step towards youth development programme when they signed a deal with cellular giants Bharti Enterprises to set up an academy in Goa. Addressing a news conference on Friday, AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the company would invest more than Rs 100 crore on the project.         
	The AIFF will build a comprehensive National Football Development Programme that is likely to start by March 31, Das Munshi said. It would be of world standard as we are planning to involve best technical brains from foreign countries.         
	The AIFF chief also hinted that another academy of similar nature has been planned in Haryana.

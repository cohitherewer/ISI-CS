The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | This innings has given me the most pain: Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                                       This innings has given me the most pain: Sourav
    - Former captain turns emotional after being dismissed for 85           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Fans express their feelings about Sourav Ganguly in Nagpur on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Nagpur: Sourav Ganguly didnt wait for umpire Billy Bowden to raise his finger. He walked. Some metres from the boundary, though, the former India captain stopped and turned to view the replay of his dismissal.         
	Another of Australian Jason Krejzas victims. The debutant, in fact, finished with eight for 215.         
	I walked because I saw (Michael) Clarke taking the catch cleanly... I stopped because, frankly, I didnt want to leave the field, Sourav told The Telegraph in his suite at the Pride Hotel.         
	That was some five hours after possibly his last innings (unless he gets to bat again in the final Test) for India and, for a change, Sourav did get emotional.         
	Just like a section of the small turnout at the new VCA Stadium, which came with a touching banner: DADA CAN NEVER RETIRE FROM OUR HEARTS... DADAGIRI NEVER ENDS.         
	Im happy that I could get 85, but this innings has also given me the most pain... I didnt get a hundred... A hundred on debut (Lords, 1996) and a hundred in the last Test wouldve been perfect, but I guess one cant have everything in life, Sourav added in a tone which was pretty revealing.         
	Fifteen runs more and Sourav would have, among others, emulated one Greg Chappell  his friend-turned-detractor.         
	As Ive said, Im happy with the effort, but... Sentiment, nostalgia... A lot of things have been surrounding this Test, but Ive tried to keep myself away from all that, otherwise I wouldnt have been able to score, Sourav pointed out.         
	Score Sourav did, producing another innings of so much character, one which may prove as decisive as the 102 in Mohali (second Test). He timed beautifully and used his feet so well. Sourav also ran a number of threes and twos in captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis company.         
	Not bad for a 36-year-old, who would often be criticised for wanting to deal in boundaries only and, thereby, not rotating strike.         
	Asked whether hed begun to look at a hundred after getting past 50, Sourav replied: I didnt become conscious at any stage, not even at lunch (80 not out)... Youre bound to get out if you start counting the runs to a hundred... Of course, I got out without doing so, something which can happen...         
	Sourav, by the way, dismissed talk that hed now be tempted to review his decision to retire. Ive made that announcement... Ive been honoured by the Board... Ill be moving on...         
	Besides wife Dona and daughter Sana, some of Souravs closest friends are in the city: Amish Patel, who has come from the UK, to the Colombo-based Rajen Udeshi to Joydeep Mukherjee, who arrived from Calcutta late on Friday.         
	The Syed Saba Karims too are around. I just wanted to wish Sourav for a fantastic career, remarked Saba Karim, who is now a Delhiwala.         
	Two down, three to go is the count.         
	Have I enjoyed myself on the first two days of my last Test? Yes, I definitely have, because Ive scored... As for the match, given the pace at which the Australians have started, its quite open, is how Sourav ended our one-on-one.

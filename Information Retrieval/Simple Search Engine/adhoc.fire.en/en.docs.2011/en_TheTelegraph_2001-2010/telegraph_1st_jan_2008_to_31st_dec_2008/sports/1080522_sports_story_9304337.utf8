	Kingston: Australia opening batsman Matthew Hayden is doubtful for Thursdays opening Test against the West Indies due to an Achilles injury, captain Ricky Ponting said on Tuesday.         
	He has actually woken up a lot better today than he has in the last two days, if he wakes up well tomorrow they will probably do some sort of testing. But youd have to say not playing last week and having limited preparation for the Test, hes probably 50/50 at best, Ponting told a news conference.         
	Hayden, who has played 94 Tests, missed the weekends tour match against a Jamaica XI due to the injury.         
	Australia were already without vice-captain Michael Clarke, who was granted leave to attend the funeral of his fiances father.         
	Ponting said that if Hayden fails to recover left-hander Simon Katich would open with Phil Jaques and Brad Hodge would come into the side at No. 5 five.         
	Australia will play three Tests, five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 game against West Indies. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India hope to conquer the demon within
                                                                                                                                                                                                       India hope to conquer the demon within
  - The weather would be a plus for us, says archer Dola Banerjee       MADHUMITA GANGULY            Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore                                 
	Beijing: After the mind-blowing spectacle that was the opening ceremony, its time now for the business end  to concentrate on the task of fetching laurels for ones country and self.         
	With a 56-strong contingent, India start their quest in a number of events on Saturday.         
	The four-member archery team of Dola Banerjee, Laishram Bombayla Devi, V. Pranitha and Mangal Singh Champia embark on their campaign on Saturday. As part of that process, the quartet have decided to give the opening ceremony a miss to be fresh and fighting fit on Saturday morning.         
	The Beijing weather has pleased Dola. Its so much similar to Calcutta, it will certainly be a plus for us, she told The Telegraph.         
	Chances are brighter in the team events, she felt. Being a 16-team event, we just need to win two matches to get into the semi-finals. Unlike in the individual events where with 64 participants we need to win four matches to enter the last-four stage.         
	Dola reiterated what she had said prior to her departure: Well be back with at least one medal, whatever may be the hue. Shooting events take off on Saturday, too. The mood in the camp of the nine shooters was very positive.         
	Gagan Narang, one of Indias best hopes in Beijing, surpassed the air rifle world record at an Olympic test event in Hanover. Narangs score of 704.3 was 1.2 more than the existing world record of 703.1 set by Austrian shooter Thomas Farnik in the World Cup finals held at Grenada in 2006.         
	I have good memories of the Beijing Shooting Range Hall (where he won a bronze in the World Cup in April) Hope it remains the same, said Narang.         
	Hopes are high that the thirty-one-year old Manavjit Singh Sandhu will reproduce the form that he was in almost two years ago at the Zagreb World Championships. The trap shooter had struck gold with a 143/150, beating the likes of Erminio Frasca of Italy and Bret Erickson of US by just a point.         
	Sandhus main challengers would be Russias defending champion Alexey Alipov and Michael Diamond of Australia.         
	All eyes, of course, would be on our silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore.         
	In the last four years, I have been training very hard. It has not been physically demanding always but it sure has been mentally very tough coping with the training and life because of a variety of reasons         
	But then difficulty, hurdles, challenges face us in different forms and to confront them with a will to overcome is part of the winning process. And it goes for each of us, wrote Rathore on his blog.         
	Anjali Bhagwat too hopes to be third time lucky.         
	I have reasons to be optimistic this time. I got my plans right thanks to coach Lazlo Szucsak. He has been of great help. We started our preparations back in April 2006. He advised me which tournaments to compete in and which ones to ignore.         
	Besides, we picked up some good ammunitions in Germany, especially some quality barrel But the competition is not with the field but the demon within. As you stand on the lane and focus on target, you tend to forget about others. Its all you and yourself. Its not easy to shut your mind and just concentrate.         
	The boxing quintet of Jitender (51kg), Akhil Kumar (54kg), A.L. Lakra (57kg), Vijender Singh (75kg) and Dinesh Kumar (81kg) too are not to be discounted.         
	Aside from Lakra, the other four are products of the Bhiwani Boxing Club in Haryana, known as the nursery of the country.         
	Events begin with Vijender taking on Gambian Badou Jack and Dinesh exchanging punches with Abdelhafid Benchabla of Algeria.         
	For Vijender too, like Anjali, its a question of trying to be third time lucky. It would be my third outing in China. Theres not much to talk about my previous assignments there, but I am hoping to be third time lucky.         
	With years of toil and the prayers of a billion well wishers behind them, would it be too much to hope for a medal or two?

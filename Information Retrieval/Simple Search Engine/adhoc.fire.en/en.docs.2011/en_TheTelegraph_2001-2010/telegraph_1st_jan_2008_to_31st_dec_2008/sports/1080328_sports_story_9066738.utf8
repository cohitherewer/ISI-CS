The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spain ride Villa strike
                                                   Spain ride Villa strike
  - England go down 0-1 to France
                      
	Elche (Spain): David Villas spectacular volley earned Spain a 1-0 win over world champions Italy in a friendly on Wednesday.         
	The Valencia striker, who replaced Fernando Torres at halftime, fired the ball past a helpless Gianluigi Buffon 13 minutes from time after Fabio Cannavaro had headed the ball clear of his area. Spain enjoyed the lions share of possession but it was Italy who created the better chances.         
	The victory extended Spains unbeaten streak to 14 matches. It was Italys first defeat since losing 1-3 to Hungary in a friendly in August.         
	In Paris, David Beckham made his 100th international appearance in Englands 0-1 loss against France.         
	With England failing to qualify for the European Championship, the team hoped for a win to mark Beckhams 100th appearance for his national team.         
	But Franck Ribery scored from the penalty spot in the 32nd after England goalkeeper David James had raced off his line to foul Nicolas Anelka.         
	I was happy to start the game, but it was more about getting on the pitch, getting that 100th cap, Beckham said.         
	While France readies for Euro 2008, England coach Fabio Capello is trying to build a team capable of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup. But his team failed to adapt to the shape he wanted and did little to worry France keeper Gregory Coupet.         
	In Belgrade, the Netherlands staged a remarkable comeback to win 4-3 in Austria while European champions Greece beat Portugal 2-1 as all 16 Euro 2008 finalists contested friendlies on Wednesday.         
	The Dutch were 0-3 down against Euro 2008 co-hosts Austria after 35 minutes but two late goals from strikers Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Klaas Jan Huntelaar gave them the win after they had clawed their way back into the match.         
	Andreas Ivanschitz and a Sebastian Proedl brace had fired the Austrians ahead before Huntelaar and John Heitinga replied for the Dutch to make the score 3-2.           (AGENCIES)

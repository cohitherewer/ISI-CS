The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ A in the box seat
                                                                                                                                                                                           NZ A in the box seat
                      
	Chennai: Openers Aaron Redmond (105) and Martin Guptil (80) combined for a 190-run stand to guide New Zealand A to a commanding 270 for three in their first innings against India A on the opening day of their second and final four-day cricket match on Friday.         
	Redmond and Martin Guptil (80) walked away with the first day honours with some superb batting after electing to bat to first.         
	The visitors crossed the 250-mark for the first time since the first match which they lost by 129 runs.         
	After the Indian bowlers toiled under hot and humid conditions without any success for most part of the day, leg-spinner Amit Mishra struck a double blow (2/62) dismissing Guptil and captain Peter Fulton (5) in successive overs after tea break.         
	Guptil was caught at deep mid-wicket by C Pujara while trying to go over the ropes after coming down the track while Fulton was caught behind.         
	 Left-arm medium pacer R P Singh was off-colour and finally managed to taste success in his third spell to send back Redmond, in the 73rd over.         
	At close of play, Greg Hay (44) and James Marshall (21) were at the crease and had added 41 runs for the unbroken fourth wicket.         
	Hay, who hit six boundaries in the third man region, was lucky as Raina floored an easy catch in the lone first slip when he was on 33 and the team total was 240/3 in the 80th over off left-arm bowler Ravi Jadeja.         
	India went into the match with four changes bringing in Sourav Ganguly, Cheteshwar Pujara, allrounder Ravindra Jadeja, Singh and Pradeep Sangwan, dropping opener Shikar Dhawan, middle-order batsmen Jaydev Shah and Yusuf Pathan and off-spinner Mohnish Parmar.         
	Meanwhile, a sore throat forced Ganguly out of field for nearly two hours.         
	The 36-year-old, who fielded in the first slip in the first two hours, did not return to the field after lunch. He returned to the field only about 10 minutes before tea-break. Ganguly has a sore throat and is on medication. But he is getting better, India A coach Dav Whatmore said at the end of the days play.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Badrinath showed some character, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Badrinath showed some character, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                           
	Dambulla: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Wednesday said he was a bit worried when India lost seven wickets while chasing a victory target of 143 and lauded debutant Subramaniam Badrinath for his responsible knock.         
	The following are excerpts:         
	On debutant Badrinath         
	Badri is very talented and thats why hes here. He has performed very well on the domestic circuit and on A tours. Its good to have him. It was his first game and he was under pressure, especially playing Murali and Mendis. I thought he played them very well. He took up the challenge, took the responsibility and scored those runs. He showed some character out there.         
	On Wednesdays win         
	A win is a good habit to have. The morale goes up. You know you can deal with them, you had a good fight in the game. You can look into the eye of the opponents and say if we play good cricket we can definitely beat you.         
	His emotions when India were seven down         
	You are a bit worried because in these conditions it was reversing a bit, it was turning a bit, so it was tough. We had a batsman at only one end, so it was a concern till the match got over.         
	On rescuing India again         
	Im losing my hair. Its a pleasure to go out there and perform under pressure. Thats what you are supposed to do that at this level. You have that responsibility, you have that pressure, and people expect you to score, so its a privilege to have. You dont have to play a hundred games to get the experience of a hundred games. Twenty-five of these games gives you the experience of 45 or 50 games.         
	On Sushils bronze medal win in wrestling         
	Another good day after Abhinav, its good to have a bronze in wrestling, and hope we win more. We will also win more games.         
	On the conditions for the bowlers         
	Its really tough for the bowlers. The last two games have helped the seamers a bit. But in the Test series and most of the times in Sri Lanka, its not a bowlers paradise. Dambulla gives assistance to the fast bowlers. It was turning but its not such that the spinners will run through a side. The credit should go to the bowlers.         
	The Dambulla wicket         
	This was a very deceptive wicket. I thought there was less grass, and perhaps it wouldnt assist the seamers. But there was some help for the fast bowlers consistently. Even when their fast bowlers were bowling before the break they got some help. Then there was a break of 40 minutes, and you can say the wicket dried up.         
	On MoM Zaheer Khans bowling         
	He has been consistent with the ball throughout. Ive played for the last four years and I have seen him bowl like this before. He has moved far ahead when it comes to his fielding as well. Bowling-wise he bowled well in England also. When you give him the ball, you know a hundred per cent is coming out of him.         
	Gautam Gambhirs condition         
	Well see what happens with Gautam. Hes got a stiff neck, but we have three more days. So hopefully hell be fine before that.

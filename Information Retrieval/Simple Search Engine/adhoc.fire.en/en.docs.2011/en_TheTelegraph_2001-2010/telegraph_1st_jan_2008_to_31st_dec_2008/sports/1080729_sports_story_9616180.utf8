The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | History will repeat itself: Dalmiya
                                                                                                                                                                                                       History will repeat itself: Dalmiya
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: Former Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Monday sounded confident on the eve of the associations elections.         
	Widely acclaimed as a sound strategist, who never lost an election as the president of the state association, Dalmiya stressed that he will be back on the hot seat again.         
	History will repeat itself, a confident Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Monday after a brief meeting with court-appointed observer Justice Santosh Kumar Phoujdar, who discussed the procedure for the elections with Dalmiya and Prasun Mukherjee.         
	I am quite confident of winning. I said it earlier also and thats the reason I have filed the nomination, the former Board of Control for Cricket (BCCI) president said.         
	The buzz that BCCI would freeze all support to CAB is doing the rounds with Dalmiyas panel appearing to sweep the elections on Tuesday.         
	The 68-year old veteran cricket administrator, however, had a different view. Asked whether his return to CAB could lead to BCCI scrapping all ties, Dalmiya said: I dont think any collective body can do that. I dont think its going to happen.         
	And if it happens we will have to cross the bridge and look into it, he added.         
	Meanwhile, Dalmiyas close allies had a busy schedule on Monday. The oppositions campaigning started early in the morning and meeting the voters topped their priorities.         
	While a few candidates contacted the district-voters over phone, Biswarup Dey of the Central Calcutta Sporting Club, candidate for the post of joint secretary, ended his day-long campaigning with a television show.         
	We will definitely win it. They are relying on the districts and thats a big mistake. Everybody wants us to be back and that will be clear tomorrow (Tuesday), a candidate, requesting anonymity, said.         
	However, after a small gathering at the CAB, Dalmiyas men sat down for a meeting in the evening to finalise the blue print for their big fight on Tuesday.         
	Dalmiya, however, remained at his office till midnight to chalk out his moves on the AGM floor.

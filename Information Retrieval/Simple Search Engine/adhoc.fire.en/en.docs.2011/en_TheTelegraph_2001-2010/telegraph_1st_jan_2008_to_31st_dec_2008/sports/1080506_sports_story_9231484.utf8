                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bhajji, Sreesanth to appear this week
                      Sreesanth and Harbhajan                       
	Ahmedabad: The BCCI-appointed commissioner Sudhir Nanavati, inquiring into the slapping row after an IPL match, has summoned Harbhajan Singh and Sreesanth, the two players involved in the episode ten days ago.         
	I have summoned them. They have been told to come either on Friday or Saturday. Harbhajan will be coming on Friday. Sreesanth is yet to confirm a date, Nanavati said.         
	Nanavati has been asked by the board to probe the incident which happened after the IPL match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab.         
	I have already recorded statement of one of the umpires of the match, Amish Saheba. I will be meeting the match referee Farokh Engineer tomorrow in Mumbai, he added. Nanavati is expected to submit his report by May 12 to the BCCI disciplinary committee as he was given 15 days time when the board appointed him as the commissioner. I have received all the documentary evidence and also video footage of the incident, Nanavati said.         
	The inquiry by the BCCI into the slapping incident is separate from the verdict reached by Engineer who had suspended Harbhajan from playing a minimum of 11 IPL matches.         
	This is a separate inquiry from the one conducted by the match referee. He had conducted the inquiry under the IPL rules, while this is the inquiry of the BCCI, Nanavati said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maria Sharapova keen to shed glamorous image 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Maria Sharapova keen to shed glamorous image 
  - Im a very low-key person... I want my tennis to speak for everything: Russian star       MARK HODGKINSON             Maria Sharapova                                 
	Waiting outside the room was a Hollywood actress, Camilla Belle. Seated inside was the worlds highest earning female athlete, a woman who has become synonymous with racket-swinging glamour and a close friend of Belles  Maria Sharapova.         
	But here was Sharapova suddenly claiming that the red-carpet lifestyle isnt really her, it doesnt make her happy and that contrary to every view you might have ever held about her, she is a very low-key person.         
	There is more to her life than pouting under the arc lights and having a spectacular party in New York this year to celebrate her turning 21. Sharapova is just as interested in being at home in Manhattan Beach in California and serving afternoon tea or home-made mint lemonade to her friends (I get the lemons from the farmers market on Tuesdays).         
	Its strange for my friends when they see me on television and in magazines, because the person that they see doing interviews and pictures on the red carpet is not the person that they know, said Sharapova.         
	The person that my friends know is much more low key than the person that everyone else sees. Im a very low-key person. I dont need many things. I dont need glamour and attention to be happy. Im very happy being settled and working my butt off and trying to win Grand Slams. I want my tennis to speak for everything.         
	When the 17-year-old, gangly Sharapova beat Serena Williams on Wimbledons Centre Court in 2004 to win the Venus Rosewater Dish, she immediately became an international brand.         
	And so the received wisdom on Sharapova is that her life is measured out in photo-shoots, parties and premieres. Yet Sharapova, the Australian Open champion, does not consider her life to be one of unbridled glamour.         
	Nor does she want it to be. She turned down a cameo role on the television show Desperate Housewives on the not unreasonable grounds that she isnt desperate and isnt a wife.         
	The worst thing about my life is not being able to see my friends and family for a long period. Living from hotel to hotel, its sometimes a nightmare.         
	There have been numerous times when Ive woken up in a hotel room and Ive forgotten which city Im in. So Ill be phoning people at 2am to ask which city Im in, said Sharapova.         
	A lot of people think my job is very glamorous and dont get me wrong, when you are successful, there are lots of amazing things you can get to do.         
	But there is a lot of work that you have to put in to get there, when you have to grind, and there are times when there are parties I cant go to because Im an athlete and you have to be professional. Those are the sacrifices that you have to make.         
	Dealing with her fame doesnt always come easily.         
	I still find my celebrity weird its always weird, you know, when I see my image on the cover of a magazine. Thats very, very strange.         
	I remember for a while I had been getting a lot of praise from people, but I never felt as though I deserved it until I had won Grand Slams and held the world No.1 ranking. And then I thought, OK, all that talk, I understand it now. But before then, it was just random.         
	I do get star struck myself. I remember meeting Michael Jordan one time at the airport. He came up to me and asked me if I was that tennis player.         
	I was so nervous that I could hardly speak. I said, Uh, yeah, I play tennis. Hes a great athlete and an inspiration, and a really nice person as well.         
	Sharapova is sufficiently self-aware to appreciate that she isnt to everyones taste. That was much obvious during this summers French Open when a crowd of hostile Parisians booed and whistled her off the court.         
	But I cant really control that. The person that they see is through television, interviews or pictures so the majority of the people looking at me from the comfort of their home arent having a conversation with me or getting to know me. Or having dinner with me, or sitting on the couch having a chat. So thats normal. People are always going to have opinions.         
	There are always going to be opinions and youre never going to make everyone happy. Thats fine with me. As much as I try not to have opinions about people, you do because thats human nature, she said.         
	The best thing about my life is that Ive had the opportunity to do many more things that I wouldnt have done if I was just in school or something. I absolutely love that because if it was just tennis, tennis, tennis I would get mad. I love variety and trying new things. Thats good for me. Ive met some amazing people and been a part of some great projects and taken care of my family and my grandparents financially, she said.         
	Sharapova has kept the same tight unit of friends.         
	I have only four or five good friends, one Ive known since I was nine or ten. Its tough just to meet people and become really good friends with them. My friends sometimes think Im a bit dorky. If I drop something its like, Yup, very typical of me.         
	At times, Im clumsy. But I think that everybody has that clumsiness in them. I love making fun of myself. I do it all the time. I was doing that in the restaurant the other night, she said and the very thought of mocking herself made her collapse into laughter again.

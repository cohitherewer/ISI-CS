                                                    Wright speaks up for beleaguered Bhajji

         John Wright 
          
	Christchurch: Former India coach John Wright suspects there was an Australian provocation behind Harbhajan Singhs on-field outburst during the Sydney Test and said the outrage against the three-Test ban on the off spinner stems from a sense of injustice. 
    
	I dont believe Harbhajan was talking in a vacuum out there, knowing how the Australians play the game in the middle, he said. 
    
	Wright, who knows Harbhajan and Symonds from his time as the Kent coach, said both are lively players but good boys. 
    
	But its not a church out there and I cant believe there was silence, he said. 
    
	Things are said in the heat of the moment, but its important players from both sides take a deep breath and step back, Wright suggested. 
    
	On the tumultuous reaction to Harbhajans ban, Wright said: I think India believes justice has not been seen to be done. 
    
	Wright, who had a fruitful five-year stint with the Indian team, felt it was not the defeat, but the circumstances that led to the result that has upset the Indians. 
    
	India have no problem in accepting a defeat but the series of umpiring howlers and the racism row have left them with a sense of injustice, said Wright. 
    
	Cricket is such a passion in the country that it is more of a national situation. 
    
	The board is not just representing the players but hundreds of millions who follow cricket, so there is a lot of pressure from that perspective. 
    
	Clearly, India is feeling a sense of injustice from the match, Wright was quoted as saying in the media. 
    
	Wright said controversial umpire Steve Bucknor, who has been replaced by Billy Bowden for the third India-Australia Test, had a history with the indian team and the ICC should consider these issues before making the appointments. 
    
	In whatever sport there needs to be accuracy and fairness in the decision-making, otherwise it undermines the game, he said. 
    
	Going by his own experience, Wright expected the bcci to do everything to support its players. 
    
	Wright recalled being with the Indian team in South Africa when Sachin Tendulkar was reported for alleged ball-tampering and Virender Sehwag was banned from a game for too much appealing. 
    
	On that occasion the board backed the team to the hilt when it felt the actions were unjust. 
    
	The final match of that series was played, but as an unofficial Test, Wright recalled. 
    
	He requested captains Anil Kumble and Ricky Ponting to bury the hatchet before the Perth Test got under way on January 16.

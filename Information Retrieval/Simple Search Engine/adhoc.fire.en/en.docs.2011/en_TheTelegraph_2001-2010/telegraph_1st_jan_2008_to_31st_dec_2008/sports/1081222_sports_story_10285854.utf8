The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reds hold Arsenal
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Reds hold Arsenal
                  Robbie Keane                     
	London: Leaders Liverpool stayed eight points clear of Arsenal in the race for the Premier League title after the two sides fought out an epic 1-1 draw at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.         
	Arsenal, reduced to 10 men after 62 minutes when Emmanuel Adebayor was sent off for a second yellow card after raising an elbow to Alvaro Arbeloa, continued to cause Liverpool problems throughout. But in the end the league leaders were well worth the point that keeps them ahead of Chelsea at the top of the table.         
	Robin van Persie put Arsenal ahead with an excellently taken goal after 24 minutes before Robbie Keane, who has struggled to find his form for Liverpool since his move from Arsenals arch-rivals Tottenham in the off-season, equalised three minutes before halftime.         
	Although Adebayors controversial red card gave Liverpool the numerical superiority, they were forced to defend resolutely to thwart Arsenal in the second half.         
	The result left Liverpool top with 39 points from 18 matches, two more than Chelsea who play Everton on Monday.         
	Aston Villa are third with 34 points from 18 games, followed by Manchester United (32 from 16). Arsenal remain fifth with 31 points from 18 games.         
	Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez was forced to stay at home following surgery for kidney stones.         
	.Keane got a chance to silence the Arsenal fans who had booed his every touch when he ran on to a long through ball from Alvaro Arbeloa and crashed a fierce half-volley into the roof of Almunias net.         
	In the days other games, Newcastle United beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 with a last-minute winner from Damien Duff while bottom-of-the-table West Bromwich Albion beat out-of-form Manchester City 2-1 with a last-minute header from Roman Bednar.

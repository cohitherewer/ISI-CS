                                                   Neelam back in AFI fold

           
	New Delhi: Discus thrower Neelam Jaswant Singh, who served a two-year ban for failing a dope test in the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki, was reinstated on Tuesday by the Athletics Federation of India. 
    
	Neelam has been re-instated to compete in the national and international competitions after completing the reinstatement testing stipulated in IAAF rule 40.12, an AFI statement said. 
    
	Neelam, 37, the 2002 Busan Asian Games gold medallist, tested for the prohibited stimulant Pemoline in Helsinki and served a ban from August 2005. 
    
	She contested the ban in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on the ground of procedural irregularities in testing and reporting but lost the case. 
    
	Her ban ended on August 11, 2007 but she had to wait much longer as IAAF anti-doping rules require an athlete to undergo reinstatement testing before he or she is allowed to return to competition. An athlete suspended for one year or more has to undergo a minimum of three out-of-competition tests with at least three months between the tests. 
    
	Besides, the athlete must undergo testing for the full range of prohibited substances and methods just prior to the end of the ineligibility period. Neelam also won bronze at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, besides winning silver in the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games and three Asian Championship medals.

                                                     Ronaldo to have surgery yet again
                  Ronaldo grimaces in pain in Milan on Wednesday. (AP)                     
	Milan: AC Milan and Brazil striker Ronaldo has ruptured a ligament in his left knee and must undergo surgery, the Serie A club said.         
	The three-time World Player of the Year was carried off in tears after going down heavily during the 1-1 Serie A draw at home to Livorno on Wednesday.         
	The 31-year-old, who has hardly featured this season because of a series of injuries, had only come on as a substitute three minutes earlier.         
	AC Milan communicate that after the first checks made at the Galeazzi hospital in Milan a rupture to his kneecap ligament was found in his left knee, the club said on their website.         
	Ronaldo sustained two serious injuries to his right knee while playing for Inter Milan in 1999 and 2000 but recovered to help Brazil win the 2002 World Cup.         
	He went on to play for Real Madrid before joining AC Milan in January 2007.         
	Were all very sad and worried about what happened to Ronaldo, said Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti. I dont want to say his career is over because only time can put the word end to his career.         
	With the draw, Milan missed the chance to go fourth in Serie A. (Reuters)

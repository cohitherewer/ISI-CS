The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Govt puts hockey back on priority list
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Govt puts hockey back on priority list
  - Ajit Pal Singh, Zafar Iqbal   on selection committee              OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A tussle between the government and the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) looked imminent on Wednesday when sports minister M.S. Gill renewed his call to all national federations to come clean and allow younger people to take over top positions.         
	M.S. Gill refrained from naming the hockey federation but dropped enough hints that he would like to see a change.         
	Speaking at a workshop organised by the Athletics Federation of India, Gill said that the clamour for autonomy among the federations was understandable but they have to prove their efficiency as well.         
	The Olympic movement and the sports federations have an important role to play in bringing India to the top of the Olympic ladder. They have to make sure that the money is used cleanly and there is accountability, he said.         
	The sports minister, who seems determined to see the end of the current regime in the IHF, added a another twist in the tale later in the day when he put hockey and seven other games back on the governments priority list. At the same time, he changed the governments nominees on the IHF selection committee.         
	Former India captains Ajit Pal Singh and Zafar Iqbal will replace R.S. Bhola and Rupa Saini on the committee.         
	The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) also seems to be toeing the government line. Though no one is ready to say so, the IOA executive committee, which meets on Monday, might recommend the suspension of the IHF.         
	The FIH has also asked the IOA to take appropriate action. We have taken notice and we are in close contact with the IOA to take proper action as they see it appropriate, president Els Van Breda Vriesman said.         
	IHF president K.P.S. Gill was in no mood to resign. I dont need anyones opinion on what I should do, he said.         
	He also announced a three-member committee to inquire into the sting operation by a TV news channel against K. Jyothikumaran. The committee will be headed by retired Madras high court Justice K.M.N. Natarajan and will include former Tamil Nadu director general of police W.I. Davaram and IHF joint secretary Rajeev Mehta.

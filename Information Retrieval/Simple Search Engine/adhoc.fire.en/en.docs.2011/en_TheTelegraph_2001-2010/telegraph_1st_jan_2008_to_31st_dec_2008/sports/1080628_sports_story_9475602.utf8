The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rename Twenty20 as Fun Cricket: Hanif
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rename Twenty20 as Fun Cricket: Hanif
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Hanif Mohammed                           
	Karachi: Hanif Little Master Mohammed has a suggestion for the sports administrators: Rename Twenty20 as Fun Cricket.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Friday afternoon, one of the first giants of Asian cricket said: I can understand its need, but those running the game must rename it Fun Cricket... Twenty20 is just that only.         
	According to Hanif, Twenty20 cricket is going to spoil the technique of batsmen. Because youve got to score at a furious pace, youll be looking to hit every ball... I fear 50 per cent of the batsmen will carry on in the same vein in Tests too...         
	He added: I know Twenty20 is a big hit and the administrators need it to raise revenue... However all aspects, including the development of batsmen, have to be taken into account.         
	In Hanifs opinion, the bowlers dont stand to lose much.         
	Asked if he wouldve played Twenty20 had it been introduced in his time, Hanif laughed and replied: If required to, yes, but not because of an inner want...         
	A triple centurion in Tests, Hanifs highest in first-class cricket was a mind-boggling 499. That record stood for decades till Brian Lara did even better in the summer of 1994.

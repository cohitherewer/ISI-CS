The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players, SLC at war over pay
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Players, SLC at war over pay

	Colombo: A protracted contract dispute between Sri Lanka Cricket and its players has reached boiling point just weeks before India are due to tour there.         
	Sri Lankan players, who returned home from Karachi on Wednesday after winning the Asia Cup, have not been paid since February and have requested an emergency board meeting.         
	We did not even see a first draft of the new contract until seven weeks after our last contract lapsed, an unnamed Sri Lanka player said. We have waited patiently for weeks, we have even played on despite being unpaid, but we are now fed-up and need this resolved fast.         
	Senior cricketers agreed to a freeze in their central contract fees this year, but demanded junior members of the national squad and the A team get substantial wage increases. Last year, junior players received $15,000 a year as a retainer, the lowest annual contract fees of all Test-playing nations.         
	The board, headed by World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga, has been accused of dragging their feet during discussions with the Sri Lanka Cricketers Association. Ranatunga has refused any increment on match fees  also believed to be the lowest among Test nations  proposing instead that players be fined if they lose a Test match.         
	Other stumbling blocks include player image rights clauses, a demand that cricketers cancel lucrative media contracts and a proposed changed in contract dates due to negotiation delays.         
	Sri Lanka Crickets Chief Executive Duleep Mendis insisted that there was no cause for alarm with the India Test series due to start on July 23. There are a few differences between the players and the board but we should come to an agreement by next week, Mendis said on Tuesday.         
	SLC has ruled out the possibility of its players boycotting the series against India, even though the board convened an urgent meeting on Thursday to sort out the issue.         
	We will be holding a meeting on Thursday with the Sri Lankan Cricketers Association (SLCA) and we are confident that the issue will be sorted out and a decision will emerge by Friday, a top SLC official said.         
	There is no threat of senior Sri Lankan players not playing against India in the Test and one day matches and we are hopeful that the contract issue will be sorted out amicably, the official said.         
	A newspaper quoted an anonymous player as saying that they could have boycotted the Asia Cup as well, which they did not. We could have boycotted the Asia Cup but we wanted to prove a point, he said.

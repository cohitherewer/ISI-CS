The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Few better match-winners than Sehwag, says Kapil
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Few better match-winners than Sehwag, says Kapil
  - Viv the only other batsman with same approach: World Cup-winning captain       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kapil Dev                                 
	Calcutta: Kapil Devs sixes-record, for India in Tests, has gone for a six. Hes far from disappointed, though.         
	A record is meant to be re-written and Im happy that somebody as devastating as (Virender) Sehwag has broken mine... In fact, till people began talking about it, I didnt even know the old one was in my name, Indias lone World Cup-winning captain told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Monday, the day after Sehwag smashed past 61 sixes, stopping at No. 64, Kapil added: The only other batsman with the same approach that I can think of is Viv (Richards)... Sachin Tendulkar has changed his game, hes more cautious now... (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni has done much the same... Sehwag, on the other hand, is more aggressive than before.         
	Laughing, he quipped: Id been expecting Sachin or Sourav Ganguly to hold the sixes-record... Had he not changed his game, Sachins tally would surely have been 100-plus (instead of 47)... Sourav too could hit big and very clean.         
	Besides a great hand-eye co-ordination, Sehwags bindaas approach makes the difference. Its his intent which is special... Hes not bound by circumstances... How many have got to 300 with a six (in Multan, early 2004)? But, then, thats Sehwag, lauded Kapil.         
	Reflecting on the Chennai Test, won dramatically by Team India, he said: When the chase began, I didnt give Dhoni and Co. more than a 10 per cent chance... (MoM) Sehwag, however, changed everything... Its almost unreal that somebody can change the course of a match within 68 balls... What an innings of 83! Our chance of winning, in my opinion, straightaway jumped to 60 per cent... Yes, there have been greater batsmen than Sehwag, but few better match-winners...         
	Kapil signed off by saying: Irrespective of what else he achieves, Sehwag will be remembered for giving the position of an opener such a new dimension... He has, single-handedly, changed the rules of the game and his place in history seems assured.         
	Indeed, and as Kevin Pietersen has learnt, it doesnt pay to underestimate an opposition which has Sehwag in the XI.

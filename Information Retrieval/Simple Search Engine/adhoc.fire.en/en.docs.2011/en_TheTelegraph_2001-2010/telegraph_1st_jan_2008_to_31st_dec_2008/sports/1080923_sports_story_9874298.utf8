            OUR CORRESPONDENT    
	Guwahati: Chinas likely pullout from the 46kg and 48kg weight categories has brightened the medal prospects of defending champions and hosts India in the six-day 4th ASBC Asian Womens Boxing Championship that would get under way at the Karmabir Nabin Chandra Bordoloi Indoor Stadium here on Tuesday.         
	Disclosing the possible pullout by China, Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) secretary general PK Muralidharan Raja said that out of 83 entries from 12 countries, 79 entrants from 11 nations have already reported.         
	He refused to give a direct answer to the likely pullout, but dropped hints that it could have a lot to do with their weight. Raja said: The Chinese pullout from the two categories will be final only after the weighing-in tomorrow (Tuesday) morning.         
	Efforts to contact the Chinese team proved futile.         
	There will be a total of 70 bouts in the 13 weight groups.

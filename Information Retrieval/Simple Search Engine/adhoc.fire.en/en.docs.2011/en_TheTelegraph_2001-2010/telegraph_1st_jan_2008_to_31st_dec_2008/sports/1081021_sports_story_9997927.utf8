                                                                                                                                                                                           Zaheer is informally cautioned
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chandigarh: Match Referee Chris Broad, in the news for making unwarranted comments (on the umpiring) in an Australian newspaper, is understood to have informally cautioned Zaheer Khan.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the Team India spearhead was spoken to after stumps on Monday, the penultimate day of the second Test against Australia.         
	Broad found Zaheers appealing to be very aggressive and, so, has informally cautioned him, is what one of the sources said.         
	Apparently, Broad has also been unhappy with offie Harbhajan Singhs conduct. In the past, the Englishman has had reservations over Harbhajans bowling action.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Twenty20 is here to stay: Pietersen
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Twenty20 is here to stay: Pietersen
                      
	London: Kevin Pietersen fears the Twenty20 storm that has swept the cricket world will, in all probability, spell the end of ODIs in the next couple of years.         
	I definitely think the longer form of one-day cricket will, in a couple of years, probably be something of the past, Pietersen told a TV channel. For sure. The way that cricket is going now, Twenty20 is definitely here to stay. We are entertainers. Everybody, I think if you asked them, would rather watch Twenty20 cricket, he added.         
	The 27-year-old said the Twenty20 storm will, however, not impact Test cricket much except for making the longest format of the game more result oriented.         
	Test match cricket will always be there because thats where you make your name. Everybody remembers your Test stats and not too many people remember your one-day stats, he explained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ehsan Maghami held on Day One
                                                   Ehsan Maghami held on Day One
            BIPIN SHENOY                      
	Calcutta: Sixth seed Grandmaster Ehsan Ghaem Maghami of Iran was held to a draw by lowly rated Swapnil Dhopade of Maharashtra in the first round of the Calcutta Open Grandmasters Chess tournament at Alekhine Chess Club on Monday. In another upset, Bangladeshi IM Enamul Hossain went down to Nikhil P. Shyam of India.         
	Maghami arrived early this morning in the city. I barely managed to sleep for three hours and was feeling tired at the board. But I dont want to give any excuses My opponent played really well and deserved the draw. It was an English opening and the closed nature of the position hardly gave me an opportunity to squeeze out a win, he said.         
	Enamul Hossain succumbed against the kingside onslaught of the pawns of Nikhil P Shyam in a Najdorf Sicilian.         
	Krishnan Sasikiran put it across Taibur Rahman of Bangladesh despite having an inferior position from the opening in a Queens Indian defence.         
	I think my 11th move Nfd7 which I made after nearly half an hours thought was a mistake, the top seed said after the game.         
	GM Koneru Humpy won with the black pieces against Arjun Tiwari in a Scotch opening. City based GMs Sandipan Chanda, Neelotpal Das and Dibyendu Barua won their respective games with ease.         
	Meanwhile, the organisers are planning to install mobile jammer during play so that no one could relay any move or message to an electronic device. They held a meeting with the police, trying to avoid last years controversy, involving D.P. Singh.

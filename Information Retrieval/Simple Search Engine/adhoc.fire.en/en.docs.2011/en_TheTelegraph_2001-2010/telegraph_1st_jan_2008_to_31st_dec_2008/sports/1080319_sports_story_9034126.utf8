	Singapore: Asias peak golf organisation has accused the PGA of Australia of attempting to invade Asia and is appealing to the international federation to stop a proposed rival tour.    
	The PGA of Australia announced last week it had an agreement with the Japan golf tour organisation and national associations in China and South Korea to create a new Asia-Pacific Tour from next January.    
	An initial 20 tournaments, each offering minimum prize money of $ 1.5 million, was proposed.    
	The Asian Tour immediately reacted by saying it would not endorse the new tour and on Tuesday said it was making a formal request to the international federation of PGA Tours to discuss recent developments initiated by the PGA of Australia.         
	Milan: Inter Milan could be without striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic for the trip to Genoa after his knee problem returned. He may be rested with an eye on the weekend clash with Juventus.     
	Luis Figo and Dejan Stankovic are also doubtful but left back Maxwell may be available after an ankle knock. Marco Materazzi is suspended so Cristian Chivu, playing with an injured shoulder, may move from left back to central defence.         
	Maranello (Italy): Jean Todt resigned as CEO of Ferrari on Tuesday and will assume a special appointment within the companys racing department.

	Todt already handed over his position as director of Ferraris Formula One team to Stefano Domenicali in November. Todt will remain a member of Ferraris board and maintain his positions as president of the boards of directors of Ferrari Asia Pacific and Ferrari West Europe. He will also continue to represent Ferrari at the FIA World Council.

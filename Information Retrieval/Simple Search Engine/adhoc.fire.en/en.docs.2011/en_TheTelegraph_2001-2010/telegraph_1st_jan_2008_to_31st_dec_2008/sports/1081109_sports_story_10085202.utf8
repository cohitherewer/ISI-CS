The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Day III highlights
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Day III highlights
                      
	 By scoring his first hundred, Simon Katich also recorded his highest score on Indian soil. His previous highest score on Indian soil was also coincidentally in Nagpur (old ground), when he made 99 in 2004-05.         
	 Katich scored his 5th Test hundred. It was also his second vs India. It is interesting to note that four of Katichs five hundreds have come away from home. Two in West Indies, one in New Zealand and now one in India         
	 Michael Hussey was dismissed in the nineties for the second time. He was dismissed on 91 vs England in Adelaide in 2006-07.         
	 It was the first time in his career that Hussey was run out. Till Saturday, Hussey (2700 runs) and Richie Benaud (2201 runs) were the only two Australian batsmen to have scored more than 2000 runs without being run out. With Hussey being run out, Benaud now remains the only member of this club for Australia. For the record, Kapil Dev has the most runs (5248 runs) without run outs.         
	 With the wicket of Shane Watson, Harbhajan Singh got his 50th wicket of 2008. It is the third time in his career that Harbhajan has taken more than 50 wickets in one calendar year.

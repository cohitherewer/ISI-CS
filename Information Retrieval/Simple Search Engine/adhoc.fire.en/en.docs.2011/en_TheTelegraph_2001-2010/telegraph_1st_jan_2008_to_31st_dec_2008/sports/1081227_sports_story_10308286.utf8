The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Self-belief a major plus for Padraig
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Self-belief a major plus for Padraig

	Wet, cold and windy, it was everything professional golfers hate. Add one of the toughest courses on the Open rota and an unforgiving set-up that left some of the mere mortal hitters in the field wondering if they would reach the fairways when driving upwind, and it was clear that only the most resolute competitors had a chance of victory.         
	In the circumstances, perhaps we should have been less surprised that Padraig Harrington should have defended the title he won at Carnoustie a year previously. The tougher the course and the more demanding the conditions, the more the Irishman excels. Give him a soft parkland stroll in a Floridian zephyr and he will not shoot the lights out. This is no streaky player mixing 65s and 74s, but a competitor galvanised by the unique test of major championships.         
	That Harrington should have followed his retention of the Open title with victory in the US PGA Championship three weeks later was altogether less likely. If there was any question over the scale of his achievement in the absence of the injured Tiger Woods  and there should not be  it was removed as the Irishman confirmed his rise to the peak of the world game.         
	Winning majors is phenomenally difficult. Huge fields, the endless variables of course and weather and the levelling effect of 72 holes make one hard enough. Winning two in a season is exceptional, and the scale of Harringtons achievements in 2008 can be gauged by the elite company in which he now finds himself.         
	In retaining the Open Harrington joined a list headed by Tiger Woods, and including Trevino, Palmer, Thomson, Locke, Hagen, Jones and Vardon. By winning two majors in a season he now also rubs shoulders with Price, Faldo, Watson, Nicklaus, Sarazen and Snead, and only three others  Woods, Price and Hagen  have matched his season-ending double. When Woods returns from injury in the spring it is Harrington he will fear most, and it is the Irishman who will arrive at Augusta in April chasing a Paddy Slam of his own.         
	Harringtons feats in 2008 mark the flowering of a career that, until his mid-20s, seemed destined for accountancy. Tenacious, unyielding and blessed with apparently boundless reserves of mental strength, Harrington is that most admirable of champions, the worker. He was not blessed with a stellar natural gift for the game but he has drained every ounce from the ability he has.         
	Watch Phil Mickelson face at the top of his through-swing and you see a half smile, the Californian apparently in awe of the ease with which he plays the game. Watch Woods and you see expectation in his eyes, the greatest player who ever laced on a pair golf shoes impatient for further evidence of his devastating skills.         
	Look at Harrington and you see effort. As he folds the club deliberately over his left shoulder and raises his eyes to follow the ball, Harringtons teeth nip over his lower lip. It lends him an air of anxiety, but in 2008 he seldom had cause to fear the results of any shot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knight Riders slump to fourth loss on the trot
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Knight Riders slump to fourth loss on the trot
  - Chawlas 21 off Ishants last over proves costly 
  -  Hussey-Sahas record 6th-wkt stand in vain         GAJINDER SINGH            Kings XI Punjabs Mahela Jayawardene congratulates Irfan Pathan for taking a wicket in their match versus Kolkata Knight Riders in Mohali on Saturday. (PTI)                                         
	Mohali: A blazing knock of 71 by David Hussey and an equally belligerent 59 by Wriddhiman Saha failed to ensure a victory for the Kolkata Knight Riders here at the picturesque Punjab Cricket Association stadium on Saturday night.         
	An inept batting display by the top order handed Shah Rukh Khans side their fourth successive defeat.         
	Chasing Kings XI Punjabs 178 for six, thanks to Shaun Marshs stroke-filled 40 and some lusty hitting by Piyush Chawla, the Knight Riders stuttered and were restricted to 169 for six by Irfan Pathan and Sreesanth. Both took two wickets each in their first spell.         
	Chawla slammed 21 off seven deliveries off Knight Riders pace spearhead Ishant Sharma in the innings last over.         
	Captain Sourav Ganguly, on whom the team depended for a good showing on a fast track, had a close shave in the first ball he received from Sreesanth.         
	After hitting Sreesanth for a boundary, Sourav ultimately fell to the Kerala speedster for five when he cut a wide ball down Pathans throat at third man.         
	Dejection was writ large on his face as he took the long walk back.         
	Interestingly, the first over of the Knight Riders innings fetched 10 runs.         
	Mohammad Hafeez, who opened the innings with Sourav, showed promise when he clobbered Pathan for a six over deep backward square leg. But he too, perished while trying a wild slog over mid-wicket off Pathan.         
	Brad Hodge survived only three deliveries. Debabrata Das and Laxmi Ratan Shukla too did not survive for long, scoring five and seven runs, respectively.         
	The 104-run partnership between Hussey and Saha  the highest sixth-wicket partnership in Twenty20 cricket  held hopes for a Knight Riders victory. But once Hussey left, it proved too much for Saha and Ajit Agarkar.         
	The Knight Riders fell short by nine runs in a game that at one stage looked one-sided with the Kolkata team tottering at 52 for five in the tenth over.         
	Pathan continued to be the most economical bowler in the tournament. He gave away just 18 runs in his four overs.         
	Earlier, Kings XI skipper Yuvraj Singh won the toss and elected to bat.         
	The team scored a competitive 178 for the loss of six wickets with opener Shaun Marsh top scoring with 40 off 32 deliveries. All Kings XI batsmen scored double figures.

	Mumbai: The Derby fever is yet to get a build up in the newspapers here but websites are going crazy over Sundays big event at the Mahalaxmi Race Course. And why not! Its going to be the richest ever Derby. Nearly Rs 2.5 crore have been budgeted for the weekend with well over half of the total amount marked for the Derby - about Rs 1.39 crore. The winners purse is, however, in excess of Rs 83 lakh. 
     
	The Derby prize money, in fact, compares favourably with some of the prized events in the European circuit. 
     
	The 2008 Derby field surpasses all past records. There are 19 horses - including five fillies - and the representation is from the entire country. In fact, three final entrants in the line-up - the Calcutta pride Regal Connection, Hyderabad challenger Ruby Queen and Bangalore hope Vanquish - each have paid a whopping sum of about Rs 5 lakh, just to rub shoulders with the expected Derby favourites - Bourbon King and Retribution. Stakes, in the Derby, can be won up to sixth place but late entrants may need to occupy at least fifth slot or upwards to salvage a part of their investments.
     
	Four of the nine foreign jockeys declared to ride in the Derby - Frankie Dettori, Mick Kinane, Richard Hughes and Ryan Moore - are expected to arrive late on Friday evening. The rest, who have been doing duty on the Bangalore and Hyderabad circuit, will be here on time for the weekend bonanza.
     
	Honestly, at least eight horses in the line-up have no earthly chance of winning the Derby but the McDowell Indian Derby (Grade I), has witnessed many an outsiders delivering rude jolts. Big shockers like Noble Eagle and more recently Velvet Rope have taken the big names in the game by surprise.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni regains top position
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dhoni regains top position
                  Sachin is placed ninth                     
	Dubai: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni toppled his South African counterpart Graeme Smith to regain the top spot in the latest ICC ODI batsmen ranking.         
	By virtue of his consistent performance, including 76 and 71 in the previous two one-dayers of the on-going ODI series against Sri Lanka, Dhoni has 803 rating points in his kitty, 27 points clear of Smith who occupies the second spot.         
	Dhoni had previously occupied the number one position for a brief period in 2006. Australia captain Ricky Ponting is third with 751 points followed by team-mate Michael Hussey and England skipper Kevin Pietersen.         
	Sachin Tendulkar is placed ninth while an out of form Yuvraj Singh is languishing at 18th.         
	Meanwhile, comeback man Zaheer Khan is the lone Indian bowler in the top 20 ODI bowlers chart at 14th spot with 642 rating points.         
	Australias Nathan Bracken leads the table, followed by New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori, teammate Shane Bond, England youngster Stuart Broad and Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	However, there is no Indian representation in the allrounders chart which is being led by Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik. Englands Andrew Flintoff and New Zealands Jacob Oram find themselves in the second and third positions respectively.         
	Although India has already pocketed the five-match ODI series against the Lankans with one match to go, that hasnt helped the Twenty20 world champions to move up the ODI championship table as they find themselves in the fourth spot. Australia continued to lead the pack, followed by South Africa and New Zealand. (Agencies)

            Malaysian Open                                Jyoti Randhawa       
	Kuala Lumpur: A battling Jyoti Randhawa remained in the hunt for the title as the Indian ace carded a two-under 70 in the third round to stay three shots behind leader Peter Hedblom of Sweden at the $2,000,000 Maybank Malaysian Open here on Saturday.         
	After the penultimate round, Randhawa totalled 14-under 202 to share third spot with two others  Soren Kjedlsen of Denmark and Simon Dyson of England  at the Kota Permai Golf and Country Club.         
	Arjun Atwal, the other Indian who made the cut, hit a four-under 68 to lie tied 11th with three others.         
	Hedblom led the pack with a flawless seven-under 65 to aggregate 17-under 199 and keep a two-shot lead over Argentine Daniel Vancsik in the event co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour.         
	Randhawa returned to the course this morning to complete two holes for a second round 65 which gave him the joint half-way lead.         
	After a wobble on his front nine in the third round, the Indian fought back with four birdies on his way back.         
	Randhawa followed his third hole birdie by a hattrick of bogeys on the sixth, seventh and eighth holes.         
	However, he recovered on the second nine by holing back-to-back birdies twice to make amends.         
	The Indian star, who is hoping to improve on his current 72nd world ranking in hope of getting into the top-50 and a place in next months US Masters, said: As long as Im knocking on the door, Im just waiting for it to open one day. Thats what I;m doing right now. I will hang in there and see what happens.         
	With a storm looming on the horizon as the last group finished on the 18th, Randhawa, a six-time winner on the Asian Tour, said he was delighted to finish the round on Saturday itself.         
	Yes, the referee was standing there and said that we had a choice to either finish the round, or go in. I decided to finish the hole and it was good to end with a birdie, said Randhawa, who won the 2004 Volvo Masters of Asia at the same course.

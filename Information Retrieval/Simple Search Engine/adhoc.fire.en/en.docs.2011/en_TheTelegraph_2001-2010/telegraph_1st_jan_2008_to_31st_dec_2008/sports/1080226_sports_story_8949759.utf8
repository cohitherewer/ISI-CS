The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Honour for Healy, Giffen 
                                                   Honour for Healy, Giffen 
                      
	Melbourne: Former Test cricketers Ian Healy and George Giffen will be inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall Of Fame (ACHOF) at the 2008 Allan Border medal night to be held on Tuesday.         
	Born in 1895, Giffen possessed a wonderful defence and had a great variety of strokes as a batsman, and was exceptionally strong in driving.         
	Playing 31 Tests, Giffen gathered 1238 runs at an average of 23.35 and hit one century and six half-centuries. He also claimed 103 wickets at an average of 27.09.         
	At the time of his retirement, Healy held the world record for the most Test dismissals (395) by a wicketkeeper, a record he held until being surpassed by fellow Australian Adam Gilchrist and then by South African Mark Boucher.         
	Hall Of Fame member Rod Marsh will induct both players, with Healy to be present on the night.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin, Yuvi see India through
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sachin, Yuvi see India through
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar finally achieved what he had always dreamt of during his long career  to score a Test hundred and complete the winning runs.         
	As he swept Graeme Swann to fine leg to achieve both at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, he couldnt hide his unbridled joy. An ecstatic jump with a clenched fist was followed by Yuvraj Singh lifting him off the ground in the middle of the pitch.         
	Needing 256 in pursuit of their target of 387 on the final day, it took a brilliant unbroken 163-run partnership between the pair to set up the six-wicket victory.         
	Interestingly, exactly 75 years ago on this day Indias first Test at home, at the Bombay Gymkhana, started against England.         
	Sachins unbeaten 103, his 41st hundred, and Yuvrajs confidence-boosting 85 not out made the chase look somewhat composed even as England applied all their forces to press for victory. For the visitors, who had dominated most of the opening Test of the RBS Cup, it was a matter of failing at the last hurdle.         
	The 25,000 odd who made it to the ground on Monday, braving the security and the restrictions, got their every pennys worth.         
	In the process, a lot of fallacies were also laid to rest. While India can no longer be termed as poor chasers, Yuvraj has shown that he does have the temperament for Test cricket.         
	Only the other day Gary Kirsten had said that this team was capable of doing anything and the players have lived true to the coachs words. Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. can now boast of showing the authority and domination only the Aussies enjoyed a few years ago.         
	Man of the Match Virender Sehwag had set up the chase on Sunday with his scintillating 83 off 68 balls. India only needed to apply themselves and bat it out session by session on Monday.         
	The start wasnt that enterprising with Rahul Dravid and Gautam Gambhir falling before lunch. Arriving at the crease just after three overs in the morning, Sachin paced the chase in superb fashion.         
	The determined look on his face showed that he was up to the challenge. He was given a fiery welcome as Flintoff tested him with a barrage of short deliveries. Not one to be pegged back, he fiercely cut one to the boundary to begin the riposte.         
	Sachin looked in firm control as V.V.S. Laxman used his uncomplicated way in forcing the attack into submission. But once he departed playing a loose shot, fending off Swann, Yuvraj took charge.         
	Be it the 155 not out versus Australia (1998), the 136 versus Pakistan (1999) or 126 against Australia (2001), some of Sachins best centuries have been scripted at this very ground. He is too hard-nosed and experienced to fret in such trying conditions.         
	Quality control was the buzzword in his batting despite being bothered by dehydration during the closing stages. Sachins willingness to control adversity showed during the 317 minutes of batting that included nine boundaries. It was a calm and controlled show of aggression. He, however, survived a close leg before shout from Stephen Harmison.         
	Fortunes swung wildly at every hour and it was a matter of keeping a cool head and applying the pressure. It was a test of ones skill and character. England tried everything under the sun to disturb the batsmens concentration. From bowling a negative line to trying to bodily harm Yuvraj  Harmison threw the ball dangerously at the batsman from his follow-through after he had defended it  nothing seemed to work in their favour.         
	It was a learning experience for Yuvraj. After his first innings failure, he was not willing to take the bait laid by Flintoff. The allrounders repeated attempts to try and begin another verbal duel never bore fruit because the Indian was simply not interested.         
	Sachins presence was vital as Yuvraj concentrated on his natural game. Even when the boundaries dried up, they kept running the singles to keep Pietersen on his toes.         
	Yuvraj, however, showed his positive intent during his 131-ball knock. He never allowed the bowlers to dictate terms and even stepped out to hit Monty Panesar for a huge six.         
	Amid the jubilation, Dravid failed to put an end to his failures. He managed scores of three and four in this Test and, despite the backing of his teammates, it wont be surprising if he decides to call it a day after this series.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hussey clears air on IPL
                                                   Hussey clears air on IPL
                      
	 Mike Hussey doubts if any player would relinquish his hard earned national cap to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for any amount of money.         
	Its time to set the record straight There are suggestions the golden eggs being laid by the IPL may force the premature retirement of Test veterans approaching the end of their playing days. (But) I have signed a short-form contract indicating I am interested in playing in the IPL, if I am available. The if is very important here.         
	You dont shake a tree and baggy green caps fall out. It takes a lot of hard work to earn one. It took me about 15,000 first-class runs, he wrote in his column for The Daily Telegraph.               
	Symonds warning         
	 Andrew Symonds has warned that the massive financial carrot being dangled by the IPL could test the loyalties of top international players.         
	The loyalty of Australian and other top international cricketers is definitely going to be tested over the next few years. Just last week we saw a couple of top Pakistanis join the rebel Indian Cricket League and theres a stack of Australian players keen to have a crack at the IPL, Symonds wrote in his column for The Sunday Telegraph.

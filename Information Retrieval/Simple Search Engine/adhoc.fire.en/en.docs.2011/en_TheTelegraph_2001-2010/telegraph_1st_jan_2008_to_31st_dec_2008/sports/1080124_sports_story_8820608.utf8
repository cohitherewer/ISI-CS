	Madrid: Fernando Alonsos unhappy experience at McLaren last season has made him a more committed and professional driver, according to Renault team boss Flavio Briatore. 
    
	Fernando has come to the team with a plenty of aggression and motivation, Briatore told a Spanish sports daily on Wednesday. I think the McLaren experience has made him stronger. 
    
	I think he is more responsible. Hes changed for the better. Fernando is very committed... Im delighted to see Fernando so motivated and so professional. 
    
	The 26-year-old Spaniard, who won his two world titles with Renault, has returned to Briatores outfit after an ill-fated season at McLaren in which he fell out with the team boss Ron Dennis over the treatment given to British rookie Lewis Hamilton. 
    
	New signing Heikki Kovalainen showed that Hamilton will not be the only McLaren driver challenging Ferrari this season. Kovalainen posted the fastest lap time in Wednesdays winter testing session in Valencia and outpaced Hamilton by more than a second in the second of three test days that featured nearly every teams 2008 cars. 
    
	The Finnish driver, who joined from Renault last month, clocked his best time at 1:11.000 seconds from 92 laps raced at the 4.005km Cheste Circuit track. 
    
	Hamilton  testing for the first time this week  was fourth with a best time of 1:12.076 from 115 laps driven. 
    
	On Tuesday, Force Indias opening day of testing was hampered by minor mechanical problems. Vitantonio Liuzzi managed only 64 laps. 
    
	 After a productive start in the morning, the day was hampered by some minor mechanical problems in the afternoon. 
    
	Force India chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne was, however, satisfied with the proceedings. It was a reasonable first day, with a couple of minor fuel related problems limiting running after lunch. We were at least able to make a start on our programme though.

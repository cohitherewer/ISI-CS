	Karachi: Having qualified for the summit show of the Asia Cup, Sri Lankas last Super-Four stage match against India is at best of academic interest but coach Trevor Bayliss on Wednesday said his side would still take the Thursday game seriously as it would prepare them for the finals.         
	It is good we have a chance to play them before the final, it gives the opportunity to carry on our good form in the tournament and extract more from the players, the Australian said.         
	While Sri Lanka became the first team to book a final berth, Pakistan have to beat India in Wednesdays match to stay in hunt and hope that Sri Lanka defeat India on Thursday.         
	Bayliss, who supervised another strenuous practice session of his team on Wednesday, said he was happy the way their batsmen have performed in the tournament, thrice managing to score over 300 runs.

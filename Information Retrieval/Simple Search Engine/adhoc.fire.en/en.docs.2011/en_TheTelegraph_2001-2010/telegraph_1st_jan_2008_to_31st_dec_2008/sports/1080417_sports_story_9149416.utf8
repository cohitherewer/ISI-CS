	Kannur: Man of the Match Javed of Kerala XI struck twice to help his side register a 2-0 win over Mohammedan Sporting in the third league match of the E.K. Nayanar Memorial Gold Cup football tournament here on Wednesday.         
	The dominant Kerala XI team, which lost 0-1 to Brazilian team Ferroviaria in the inaugural tie on Monday, went into the lead when Javed netted the first goal in the 18th minute.         
	The men of the black-and-white brigade made some valiant efforts to level the score in the final moments of the first-half. However, some brilliant saves from the Kerala custodian Deepu K. put the city outfit at bay.         
	After the change of ends, the Kerala XI made things more difficult for Mohammedan Sporting. In the 66th minute Javed struck the second goal, as Kerala XI brightened their chances for a semi-final berth.

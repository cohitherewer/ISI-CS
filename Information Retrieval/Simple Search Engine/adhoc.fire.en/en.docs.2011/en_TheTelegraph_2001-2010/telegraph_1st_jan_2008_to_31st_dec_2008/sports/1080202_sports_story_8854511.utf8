                                                    Prakash: We are clear favourites

	New Delhi: Prakash Amritraj, who arrived in the capital on Friday for Indias Davis Cup tie, said he was forced to withdraw from the challengers in Guangzhou, China recently owing to the severe cold weather. 
    
	Amritraj, who was scheduled to play in the singles, withdrew at the last moment amid speculation on his fitness. The Indian did pair up with Mustafa Ghouse but suffered an early exit in the doubles event. 
    
	I am completely fit and playing good tennis, Prakash said at the DLTA Courts where he underwent an hour long practice session under the watchful eyes of coach Nandan Bal. 
    
	The cold there was unbearable. I withdrew as a precautionary measure for the forthcoming Davis Cup tie, he said. I wanted to concentrate on this tie. 
    
	Prakash said India are clear favourites in the Asia-Ocenia tie against Uzbekistan to be played here from February 8 to 10. 
    
	India are favourites, he announced. Yes, we lost the previous tie at their den but it is going to be a different story here. 
    
	The presence of Denis Istomin, the only player in the two teams to break into top 200 recently, is not bothering Prakash too much. 
    
	Istomin is definitely a much improved player. I watched his match against Hewitt in the Australian Open. He played well. But I have played against him twice and won on both occasions, he pointed out. 
    
	Prakash first met Istomin in a Davis Cup tie in Jaipur (2005) where he won in straight sets. In the next face-off in Vietnam in the following year, Prakash prevailed again but the Uzbek snatched a set. 
    
	The Uzbekistan team had a three-hour practice session on the hard courts. The National Sports Club of India (NSCI), which promised to provide the visitors with grass courts from Friday, failed to keep their promise as the courts are not yet ready.

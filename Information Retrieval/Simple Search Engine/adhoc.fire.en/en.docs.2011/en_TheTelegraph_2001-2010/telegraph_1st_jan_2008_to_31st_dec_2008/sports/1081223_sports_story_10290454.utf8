	Madrid: Thierry Henry scored the winner as Barcelona came from behind to beat Villarreal 2-1 away and go 10 points clear at the top of the Primera Liga on Sunday.         
	Cani had given Villarreal the lead just after the restart at the Madrigal, bursting clear to chip Victor Valdes. Barcelonas Mali midfielder Seydou Keita levelled with a brave header soon after and France striker Henry volleyed the winner in the 67th minute from Xavis run and cross.         
	Barcelona played the last 15 minutes with 10 men after defender Gerard Pique was shown a second yellow card but they hung on for the win and have now beaten all five of their closest challengers.         
	Pep Guardiolas side have 41 points from 16 games which is the sides best start to a league campaign.         
	They also claimed the honorary title of winter champions with three matches left to the mid-point of the season.         
	Sevilla were held to a 0-0 draw away to struggling Real Mallorca but climbed into second place on 31 points.         
	Manolo Jimenezs side, who were knocked out of the Uefa Cup during the week, put in a listless display and Luis Fabiano headed their best chance against the bar in the first half. Atletico Madrid are third with 30 points, above Valencia on goal difference after their 3-2 win at Espanyol on Saturday, when Valencia lost 1-0 at Real Madrid.         
	The champions are a point back in fifth ahead of Villarreal on goal difference, and two points in front of seventh-placed Deportivo Coruna, who sank Recreativo Huelva 4-1 at home. Lowly Numancia pulled off the comeback of the day against in-form Real Valladolid, scoring three times in the last 10 minutes to win 4-3 at home.         
	In Serie A, Juventus won 3-1 at Atalanta to pull within six points of Serie A leader Inter Milan. Alessandro Del Piero, Nicola Legrottaglie and Amauri each scored for Juventus.         
	Inter beat Siena 2-1 on Saturday and lead with 42 points. Juventus have 36 points and AC Milan have 33 following a 5-1 victory over Udinese.         
	Alexandre Pato and Kaka each scored twice for Milan, and Clarence Seedorf also found the net at the San Siro.         
	David Beckham, who will play with Milan for two months when the Serie A season resumes in January, saluted fans. It was great to see the kids that presented me with the jersey and feel the fans affection, but tonight I would have liked to play, Beckham said.

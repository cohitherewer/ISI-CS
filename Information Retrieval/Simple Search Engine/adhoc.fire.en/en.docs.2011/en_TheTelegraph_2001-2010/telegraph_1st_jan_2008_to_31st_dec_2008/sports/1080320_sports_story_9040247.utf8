The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players body slams CSA
                                                   Players body slams CSA
                      
	Johannesburg: Pace bowler Charl Langeveldt withdrew from the tour of India owing to political interference, the South African players association (SACA) said on Wednesday.         
	Langeveldt, who is of mixed race, had been controversially included in the South African squad instead of fellow fast bowler Andre Nel to satisfy a racial target of six players of colour amongst the 14 players.         
	South Africa stand to lose two of their premier fast bowlers, Langeveldt and Nel, because of political interference in selection, SACA chief executive officer Tony Irish said in a statement on Wednesday.         
	Langeveldts request to be removed from the squad to tour India is the desperate unhappiness of a player who knows that he has been selected for this tour for quota reasons.         
	Irish called for Cricket South Africa (CSA) president Norman Arendse to relinquish his right of veto over team selection. Bitter infighting broke out within South African cricket in February when Arendse refused to approve the squad initially chosen to tour Bangladesh because it included only four black players.         
	His veto was eventually side-stepped when CSA chief executive Gerald Majola released the team, leading to a stand-off between the countrys two leading cricket administrators.         
	Any form of veto, interference or involvement in the selection of the Proteas by anyone who is not a selector should be abolished, said Irish. The players association recently made that recommendation to Cricket South Africas Transformation Review Committee.

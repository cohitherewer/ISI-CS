The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Report rules out mala fide intent
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Report rules out mala fide intent
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES            Monika Devi                           
	New Delhi: The controversy surrounding weightlifter Monika Devis dope test, which led to her being dropped from the Beijing-bound Olympic squad, could have been easily avoided, according to T.S. Krishnamurthy.         
	At the same time, the former chief election commissioner, who was appointed by the Ministry of Sports to probe the issue, said in his report on Friday that once selected for participation in an international competition, an athlete has to be treated with utmost dignity.         
	Until the adverse finding is established beyond doubt, the communication between the administrative authorities and the athlete should be prompt and fully transparent.         
	Criticising the entire system, Krishnamurthy said a better management of the coaching camps, selection of athletes, testing of the samples and communication of the result could have avoided the whole controversy.         
	I am left with the impression that at every stage the urgency, transparency and sensitivity of the athletes concerned seemed to have been put on the backburner and an ad hoc approach to the core issues was more evident, said Krishnamurthy in his report.         
	The report, however, made it clear that there was no mala fide intent on the part of any individual to disgrace the Manipur lifter.         
	However, I must state that I did not come across any concrete evidence of any mala fides on the part of any individual although it is very clear that there was lack of unity of purpose among all these persons.         
	The report also pointed out that there was considerable delay in completing the test of the sample of Monika Devi.         
	On the other hand, Olympic medallist Karnam Malleswari backed Sports Authority of India (SAI) in the Monika Devi-controversy, saying the spectre of another Olympic dope-shame may have prompted the national body not to clear the Manipuri lifter for Beijing.         
	I believed 100 per cent when SAI said the results indicate there was possibility of doping, she said.         
	I think it was not a question of any personal enmity. As far as I know, there were some doubts about the test results of Monika, and SAI must have thought it was better not to clear her instead of another dope shame for the country in Beijing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Krejza admits testing positive for cocaine
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Krejza admits testing positive for cocaine
    - It was a real shock when it all happened, says Aussie spinner                   Jason Krejza                           
	Melbourne: On the cusp of making his international debut, Australian spinner Jason Krejza has disclosed that he had tested positive for cocaine in 2006 as his drink had been spiked at a nightclub.         
	The 25-year-old old Krejza, waiting to play his first Test for Australia when they take on India in the first match of the series in Bangalore next week, said his drink had been spiked at a nightclub three days before a New South Wales second XI match in November 2006.         
	Krejza said he was shocked but followed correct channels after he experienced an unusual dazed sensation, which was different from being under the influence of alcohol.         
	He telephoned an NSW player welfare officer and was withdrawn from the match. He was ordered to submit a urine sample, which revealed traces of cocaine in his system, although two subsequent tests over the next fortnight were clear.         
	It was terrifying. It was a real shock when it all happened. My first reaction was to go through the correct channels (with Cricket NSW). We are told of these processes all the time, so my immediate reaction was to speak to the appropriate people there, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper.         
	You think about how (a potential positive test) might affect things, but thats just from the shock. Basically, it was terrible, he added.         
	NSW and Cricket Australia officials endorsed Krejzas version of events and he was not sanctioned for the positive test, the paper said.         
	The spinner refrained from drinking for the rest of the season and claimed 18 wickets for Tasmania in seven games last season, including a career-best haul of 4/91 against Victoria.         
	Acting Cricket Australia chief executive Michael Brown said the positive test would not count against Krejza during the selection.         
	Based on the information we have received regarding these circumstances, not at all, Brown said.         
	I saw a report recently that stated there were around 4000 reported cases of drink spiking last year and higher-profile athletes and celebrities can be targeted.         
	We issue booklets to players warning of the dangers of these kind of incidents, he added.           (PTI)

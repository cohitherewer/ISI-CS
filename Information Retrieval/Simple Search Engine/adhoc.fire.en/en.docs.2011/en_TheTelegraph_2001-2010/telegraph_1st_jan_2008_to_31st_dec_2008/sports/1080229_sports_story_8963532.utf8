            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Leander Paes will continue to lead India in the Davis Cup and the matter of players revolting against him has been put in abeyance till the Olympic Games in Beijing.         
	This was decided in the emergency executive committee meeting of the All India Tennis Association (AITA) here on Thursday.         
	The meeting, which was called to discuss the revolt of players  Mahesh Bhupathi, Rohan Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj  against skipper Paes, also decided to retain the same squad for the Davis Cup tie against Japan to be played here in April.         
	AITA has formed a two-member committee comprising Bharat Ojha and Hiranmoy Chatterjee to look into the grievances of the players.         
	Time is too short to consider such an issue. We need to talk to the players and selection committee, Anil Khanna, AITA secretary general, said.         
	The AITA has appointed SP Mishra as the manager of the tie versus Japan. Col Randhir Chauhan, has been appointed the media manager.         
	Agencies add: Meanwhile, Bhupathi has reiterated that the disgruntled players wont take to the field against Japan if Paes remains the captain.         
	We have to wait and see We have taken a stand and as of now I dont think we will play until a senior player is made a non-playing captain, Bhupathi told a television channel.

	London: David Beckham has welcomed the arrival of Fabio Capello as Englands new coach and believes the Italian will instil a fear factor that should make the team great again. 
    
	Beckham played under Capello when Real Madrid won the Spanish league title last season before the former England captain moved on to the Los Angeles Galaxy. Although Capello dropped him, he recalled Beckham for a successful spell which led to Madrid capturing the title. 
    
	Currently training with Arsenal to get fit for the Major League Soccer season, Beckham described the former AC Milan and Madrid coach as a dedicated, passionate manager in the style of Manchester Uniteds Alex Ferguson. 
    
	He has an aura that players will enjoy, Beckham told a television channel. They are going to enjoy playing under him. I enjoyed playing under him, even in the bad times. 
    
	Apart from Sir Alex Ferguson, I have never seen anyone so dedicated to watching football and learning about it. He will do it his way and that is a good thing, he added. 
    
	We had the fear factor the year we won La Liga. That is what all great managers have. The fear factor with a manager is important. We had it at Manchester United with Sir Alex Ferguson, and he had so much success and is still having it. 
    
	The Football Association hired Capello a month ago after firing Steve McClaren who failed to get England to Euro 2008. The Italians first game in charge will be a friendly against Switzerland on February 6 and, although he officially sits behind his desk for the first time on Monday, he went to FA Cup games between Aston Villa and Manchester United, and Luton and Liverpool over the weekend. 
    
	Beckham hopes Capello will select him for his 100th cap against the Swiss at Wembley. 
    
	Im there to get my fitness for the MLS season and also to try to get fit for the England game, he said. Even if it wasnt just for the 100th cap, for an England game Id do the same. I want to be fit and be available for Mr. Capellos first team and first game. 
    
	Im lucky that (Arsenal manager) Arsene Wenger has given me the chance to train with the team. Its nice to be with a Premier League team that is obviously so talented. The players have accepted me really well.

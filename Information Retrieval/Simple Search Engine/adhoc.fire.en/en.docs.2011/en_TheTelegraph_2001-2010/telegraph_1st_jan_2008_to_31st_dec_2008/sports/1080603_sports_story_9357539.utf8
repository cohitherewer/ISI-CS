	Karachi: Pakistans young pacer Sohail Tanvir, who won the best bowler award in the IPL, Sunday said he had thoroughly enjoyed his time in the league playing for champions Rajasthan Royals, and learnt a lot.         
	I enjoyed every match of the tournament and before the league I had set a target of taking most wickets in the league for myself. I am happy I achieved it. It is a great feeling to be the leading wicket taker... I have become a better bowler now, Tanvir said.

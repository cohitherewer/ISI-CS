	Durban: South Africa are considering fielding an all-seam attack in the third Test against West Indies, captain Graeme Smith said on Wednesday. 
    
	The series, tied at 1-1, will be decided in the match, which starts in Durban on Thursday. 
    
	The thought of playing another seamer is on our minds, Smith told a news conference. These days we always want to play a spinner, but spinners havent had much success here over the years. 
    
	Left-arm spinner Paul Harris will miss his first Test of the season if he is not selected. Harris could be replaced by medium-pacer Shaun Pollock, who has not played in any of South Africas six Tests this season. 
    
	Fast bowler Dale Steyn is battling a hamstring strain he sustained in the second Test in Cape Town, which South Africa won by seven wickets on Saturday to square the series. If Steyn is not fit, fast bowler Monde Zondeki will win his sixth cap. 
    
	West Indies captain Chris Gayle, who broke a thumb while batting in the second Test, ruled himself out of the match on Monday. 
    
	However, coach John Dyson suggested that Gayle might play. Its up to Chris, but medical advice is for him not to think about playing, Dyson said on Wednesday. We havent talked about him playing or not playing. 
    
	Windies spearhead Fidel Edwards is also trying to bounce back from a hamstring injury. 
    
	Smith said he had been impressed by the performance of the West Indians, who won their first Test in South Africa in the opening match of the series in Port Elizabeth.

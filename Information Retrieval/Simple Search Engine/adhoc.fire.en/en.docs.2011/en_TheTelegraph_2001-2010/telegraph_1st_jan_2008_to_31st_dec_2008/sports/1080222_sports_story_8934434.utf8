	Calcutta: Australian cricketer David Hussey has said that he is both surprised and embarrassed by his $625,000 purchase by the IPL side, Team Calcutta.         
	Hussey, who clubbed the second-fastest one-day century in Australian cricket on Wednesday  a 60-ball hundred for Victoria against New South Wales at the SCG  said he initially thought the price was a joke.         
	It was indescribable, the batsman was quoted as saying in the Herald Sun on Thursday. I got told and then sat and said Are you taking the mickey out of me? They said it was genuine its just remarkable. Its very flattering.         
	Calcutta rated Hussey worth a lot more than Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who the side also picked up, and also higher than even leg-spin legend Shane Warne.         
	But Hussey said the best part was a text message from older brother Mike, an established Test star for Australia, who will be paid $350,000 to be part of the IPL.         
	He sent me a text message and said, I cant believe youre worth almost double of what I am, Hussey laughed.

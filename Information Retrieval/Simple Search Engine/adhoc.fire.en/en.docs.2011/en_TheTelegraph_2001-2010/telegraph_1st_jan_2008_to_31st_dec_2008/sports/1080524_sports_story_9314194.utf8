	Virginia Water (England): Jeev Milkha Singhs nightmarish opening round of six-over 78 jeopardises his chance of making cut at the euro 4.5m BMW Open even though compatriot S.S.P. Chowrasia moved to tied 12th after bringing home a card of 70.    
	Shiv Kapur turned in a card of one-under 71 to be tied 26th, while Jyoti Randhawa stood tied 59th after an erratic round of 73. Jeev faltered on a treacherous front nine, dropping as many as five bogeys. On his way back, the seasoned campaigner did birdie the 11th and 18th holes but that was of little consolation as he dropped three shots in between to stutter to 78.    
	In contrast, Indian Masters winner Chowrasia finally seemed to have got his rhythm back. He cancelled out a bogey treble with three birdies and went on to fire an eagle on the par-five 12th hole to stay in the hunt for a decent finish.

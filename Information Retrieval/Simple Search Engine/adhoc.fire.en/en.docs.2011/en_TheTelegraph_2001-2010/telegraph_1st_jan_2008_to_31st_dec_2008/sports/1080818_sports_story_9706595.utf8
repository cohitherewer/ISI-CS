            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Subrata Bhattacharjees first visit to the Mohun Bagan ground as United SC coach was marred by controversies.         
	While Subratas team frustrated Mohun Bagan with their performance on the pitch, Mohun Bagan officials were irked by the presence of an extra member of the United SC support staff in their dugout.         
	Before play resumed after half-time, Mohun Bagan officials pointed this out to referee Tushar Kanti Guha ,who after a brief discussion with officials of the two sides, decided to send the official in question into the galleries.         
	With Mohun Bagan drawing the match, a section of the home fans turned hostile towards the opposition coach. Angry fans vented their ire and jostled Bhattacharjee while the United SC coach was making his way out of the ground.         
	The former Bagan captain was pushed, while others hurled abuses at him. Few, however, requested him to beat Mohun Bagans rivals.         
	Bhattacharjee later said he couldnt believe the way some fans treated him. This is shocking, all the respect that I had for Mohun Bagan fans is lost after todays (Sunday) incident.

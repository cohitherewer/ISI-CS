The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI declines ECB invite
                                                                                                                                                                                           BCCI declines ECB invite
                      
	London: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has rejected Englands invitation to play in their version of Champions League to be held in Sharjah in October, giving a twist to the wrangling between the two boards over the Twenty20 event.         
	The BCCI vice-president and IPL commissioner Lalit Modi has conveyed Indias decision to the ECB chief executive David Collier, who had sent the invite.         
	Indias refusal to take part in ECBs Twenty20 initiative came a day after the BCCI made it clear that it would go ahead with its own version of the Champions League, and was prepared to leave out teams from England if they did not agree to the terms and conditions. The BCCI replied on Monday saying that although it wished the ECB all the best with its tournament, it was not in a position to accept the invitation.         
	Modi has also clearly informed the eight IPL franchises that they can participate only in tournaments run and approved by the BCCI.         
	Both BCCI and ECB are insisting on staging their versions of the Champions League. (PTI)

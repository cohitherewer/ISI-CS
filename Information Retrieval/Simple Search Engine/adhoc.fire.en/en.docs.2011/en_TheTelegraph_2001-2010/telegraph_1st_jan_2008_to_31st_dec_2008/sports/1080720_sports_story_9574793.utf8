The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Greg Norman puts up vintage display
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Greg Norman puts up vintage display
  - KJ Choi leads Australian legend by one shot after Round II       LEWINE MAIR            KJ Choi in action at the British Open. (AP)                                 
	Greg Norman, the two-time Open champion who nowadays spends more time on the tennis court than the golf course, finished the second day of the 137th Open championship a shot behind KJ Choi. The Korean closed with a couple of birdies to overtake him, but still all the talk was of whether a 53-year-old such as Norman could go on to win.         
	If he could, he would be five years older than Julius Boros when the latter captured the 1968 USPGA Championship at Pecan Valley. The oldest Open winner as yet is the 46-year-old Old Tom Morris in 1867.         
	On a day when the wind was infinitely less hostile than had been predicted, Norman had a second 70. As for Choi, who has the same Andy Prodger on his bag who caddied for Nick Faldo in the 1987 Open at Muirfield, he followed his opening 72 with a 67. Meanwhile, Padraig Harrington bedded down for the night on 142, just three shots off the pace.         
	Norman and his caddie, Linn Strickler, have a combined age of 111. Norman, at 53, is lean, fit and head over heels in love with his new spouse, Chris Evert. Strickler, for his part, has 58 worn, torn years under his belt.         
	One under par after 15 holes, player and caddie faced a test per hole at the end. At the 16th, Norman had to lean over his fairway bunker shot with his feet outside the trap but still contrived to get up and down. At the next, he was in rough on the left and right before catching a greenside bunker in four. Once again he got up and down, this time to salvage nothing worse than a bogey.         
	The crowds cheered the old master down the last as if he were Tiger Woods himself. Norman loved it but, with his adrenaline running correspondingly high, he promptly knocked his first putt 20 feet past the flag. To another triumphant roar, he knocked that one in.         
	Afterwards, he talked of the extent tennis helped to keep him fit. In which connection, he is clearly a far better tennis player than he has been making out. When he described himself as the equivalent of a 20 handicapper, his wife muttered, What is he talking about?         
	You ask Evert to name the most pertinent piece of advice she feels she has given her husband and she opts for telling him to play within himself. Hes so competitive that he can make the mistake of getting too aggressive, she explained.         
	Choi, meanwhile, is inspired by quotes from the Bible, on which he draws at various during the round. He also hums the odd hymn. Also looking good at this stage of the championship is Ian Poulter, who is on 143. He may come across as a bit flash but he is churning out the pars in relentless fashion.

                                                     Sourav should focus on Tests: Wessels
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Kepler Wessels                           
	Chennai: Kepler Wessels believes Sourav Ganguly should concentrate only on Test cricket. It will be a good thing for him if he decides to concentrate only on Tests, the former South Africa captain (a Test centurion on debut for Australia, too) told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	Back in June 2006, Wessels had played his part when Sourav joined Northamptonshire for a short stint during his exile from Team India. It proved effective and the former captains success since being recalled to the national side is now history.         
	The former Northants director of cricket and coach is here on a TV assignment.         
	When he joined Northants in 2006, Sourav was not in good shape His confidence was low and he was struggling with the bat. We had a number of discussions during which both he and the side benefited. Sourav was very keen to do well on the tour of South Africa later that year He proved his mettle, Wessels said.         
	Wessels, who coached Eastern Province in South Africa, left Northants 18 months ago. My contract was for four years and I decided not to continue.         
	He will be in charge of the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League. Led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the team is possibly the strongest and includes the likes of Stephen Fleming, Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey, Albie Morkel, Muttiah Muralidharan, Makhaya Ntini and Jacob Oram.         
	I dont know if we are the best. A lot will depend on the availability of the overseas players. Moreover only four can play in every match. A lot will depend on the quality of the local players, he said.         
	The tournament will be very open during the first year. We will have a better idea of who is the favourite from the second year.         
	Has he got a chance to talk to Dhoni on the preparations?         
	I plan to do so during the next week or so once this Test gets over. However, I am already working on certain things and had discussions with other officials. I will also be coming here in between the next two Tests to have a look at some of the local players.         
	Wessels believes this South African side has it in them to excel and hopes they will be successful against India on this tour.         
	They are a good side The players have been together for some time and are winning a lot. The bowling is strong and they have achieved success in the subcontinent. The team that wins the first Test will enjoy the upper hand in a three-game series.

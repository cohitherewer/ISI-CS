	New Delhi: Virender Sehwags smile is back. After four back to back defeats, the 12-run victory over the Deccan Chargers on Thursday night came as a huge morale booster for the Delhi DareDevils.         
	So much so that the skipper  when confronted with the fact that the match against Kings XI Punjab at the Kotla on Saturday could prove to be a do-or-die battle for the hosts to stay afloat in the Indian Premier League (IPL)  said that he wasnt too concerned about the oppositions form.         
	At this stage, all the matches are challenging that is for every team in the competition, Sehwag commented. I know that the Punjab side are on a roll but in Twenty20 any team can come and beat you hands down. Maybe we could be donning that role tomorrow, he said.         
	The fabulous bowling of Amit Mishra on Thursday has certainly given Delhi a new-found confidence.         
	We have Piyush Chawla and they have Amit Mishra, said Yuvraj Singh.         
	Like Piyush, the Delhi boy has also got class and variation. Piyush has already played for India. Both these two bowlers can play crucial roles tomorrow, the Punjab skipper said.

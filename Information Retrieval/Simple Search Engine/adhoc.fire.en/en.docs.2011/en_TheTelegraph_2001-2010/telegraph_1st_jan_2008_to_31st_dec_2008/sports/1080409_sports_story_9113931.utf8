The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ACU officials question Shoaib
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ACU officials question Shoaib
                      
	Karachi: Pakistans banned fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has been interviewed by the International Cricket Councils Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU), team sources said on Tuesday.         
	The ICC and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) declined to comment on the development, which comes a week after Shoaib claimed in a television interview to have several times been offered money to underperform but rejected them for the love of his country.         
	Nuruddin Khawaja, ACU security officer in Pakistan, said only the ICC was authorised to comment while an ICC spokesman said: We dont comment on the activities of the ACU.         
	Sources said an investigating officer interviewed the pacer and some other players with the assistance of Khawaja. The officer arrived two days ago and would now submit a report to the ACU.         
	Shoaib said in his television interview that he got offers in South Africa and India and back in 2003 was offered bags of money but told the man to get out of his room.         
	His comments came a day after the PCB, for several violations of players code of conduct, banned him for five years. Shoaib has filed an appeal against the ban which will be heard by a tribunal headed by a former Lahore high court judge.         
	Under the ICC Code of Conduct, a player who fails to report an approach to fix games or underperform to his captain, team manager, board or the ACU can be banned for one to five years.         
	Since banning Shoaib last week, the PCB said he could face an ICC investigation over his claims, with chairman Nasim Ashraf saying Shoaib had never spoken to the board about his claims.

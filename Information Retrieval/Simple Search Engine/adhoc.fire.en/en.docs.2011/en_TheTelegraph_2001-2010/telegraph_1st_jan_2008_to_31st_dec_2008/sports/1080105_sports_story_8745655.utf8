                                                  Bagan aim to cash in on Yakubu absence 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia at the Mohun Bagan ground on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The Mohun Bagan and Mahindra United camps could well have been singing, we are in the same boat brother, on the eve of their ninth-round clash in the ONGC I-League. Both have 11 points and are looking to pocket three more to move closer to the top three (JCT, Dempo and Churchill Brothers).         
	Beneath the surface, though, there is one significant dissimilarity which could have a bearing on Saturdays outcome. Besides the only match they lost in the campaign so far  a 1-5 drubbing at the hands of Churchill  Mahindra have conceded just three goals in seven games. Thats a telling commentary on Mahindras defence.         
	Sandip Nandy has stood tall under the bar, while Bello Rasaq amp; Co. have absorbed everything the rivals have thrown at them.         
	The green-and-maroons may be a resurgent lot, having won two of their previous three outings after losing three of the first five, but even the in-form Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto will have their task cut out to breach the Mahindra defence.         
	No one knows that better than Barreto, who spent a season with the Mumbai outfit and helped them clinch the Federation Cup as well as the NFL.         
	Coach Carlos Roberto Pereira, too, is aware of Mahindras strengths. They are a good side, but we have a plan. Its important for us to get three points, said the Brazilian.         
	One mans absence could be a blessing for the Mohun Bagan defence. Prolific scorer Yusif Yakubu, nursing a hamstring injury, is not part of the squad for the Calcutta match.         
	It is an advantage for us, says Barreto.         
	Bhaichung, however, doesnt agree. Theyll play as a team We should be thinking of our game and not about the opponents, says the talismanic striker whose five goals have come in the last four matches.         
	Mahindra coach Derick Pereira tried to play down Yakubus absence. Yakubu is not there but the others are there Mohun Bagan are a tough side, but we have to go for a win, said Pereira.         
	He did, however, stress on the importance of finishing well. They have averaged a goal per match, which is not ideal for a team dreaming to be the champions.

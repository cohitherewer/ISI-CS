	Beijing: A sub-par card eluded all three Indians in the fray with Gaganjeet Bhullars one-over 73 being the pick of the lot that had the youngster tied 29th after the penultimate round of the $2.2 million Volvo China Open on Saturday.         
	Bhullar could have been found himself higher in the ladder but for a wretched six-hole stretch that cost him five shots. Birdies on the second, 10th, 11th and 18th were the saving grace for the Indian whose three-day total reads one-over 217.         
	After a scintillating second round of 69, veteran Gaurav Ghei (220) went three-over 75 on Saturday to slide down the leaderboard at tied 44th. His erratic round had three bogeys and a double bogey, as against just a couple of birdies.         
	Worse was the case with Indian Masters winner S.S.P. Chowrasia (223) who returned his worst card of the week so far, a poor 76, to slip to tied 60th.         
	He had an ominous start, dropping two shots on his opening hole at the Beijing CBD International Golf Club. On his way back, he double-bogeyed the 14th as well, for the second consecutive day. In between, he bogeyed the fourth and eighth, which meant birdies on the third and 15th were of hardly any consolation.         
	Irelands Damien McGrane set himself up for his maiden career win with a third round of 68 that gave him the pole position at 11-under 208.         
	Overnight leader Michael Lorenzo-Vera (208) of France returned a level-par round to slip to the second spot, a place he shared with Englishman Oliver Wilson (70). (PTI)

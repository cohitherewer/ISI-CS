The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sharma enjoying the challenge
                                                Sharma enjoying the challenge
                      
	Melbourne: Indias tri-series squad is short on experience but promising middle-order batsman Rohit Sharma refuses to believe that the absence of seniors is putting extra pressure on the youngsters.         
	Sharma was aware that a few youngsters, including him, were in the squad at the expense of seniors like Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly, but they were taking it as a challenge to prove themselves. I wouldnt say its pressure. Its more of a challenge for us youngsters to do well, Sharma said.         
	He added that the young brigade had proven themselves in the ICC World Twenty20 and said the players were trying their best to make their presence felt.         
	We won the ICC World Twenty20 without seniors and we would try to do well in this present series too, he said on Friday. (PTI)

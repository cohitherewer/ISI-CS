The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldinho joins Milan
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ronaldinho joins Milan
                  Ronaldinho waves at fans on arrival at AC Milans training in Carnago, near Varese, on Wednesday. (Reuters)                     
	Milan: Ronaldinho has promised to work hard at his new club AC Milan, after leaving Barcelona under a cloud.         
	The Brazilian forward, who suffered from form and fitness problems at the Nou Camp last term, landed in Milan on Wednesday and underwent a medical test. He will sign a deal with Milan to play there till June 2011. Ronaldinhos transfer has taken three months of bargaining and will initially cost $33 million, much less than Premier League side Manchester City were reported to have bid for him.         
	I am sorry for the wait but the facts show that I have always wanted Milan, Ronaldinho told a magazine. This is not the moment to talk about Barcelona because I want to enjoy this new chapter of my life. I will only say that at Milan I promise commitment, not only on my technique.         
	Ronaldinho caused a row at Barcelona even in his last few days at the club when he was told he would not be able to represent Brazil at the Olympics. Milan have blocked his compatriot Kaka from going to Olympics, but media reports on Wednesday said part of Ronaldinhos deal with the Rossoneri was to allow him to go to Beijing next month.         
	Beating off English side City to sign the 28-year-old is being seen as a coup in Italy given that Serie A has slipped behind the Spanish and English leagues in recent seasons. Money is also tighter than usual at the San Siro this season with Carlo Ancelottis side only in the Uefa Cup, so no further signings are expected. Arsenals Mathieu Flamini is the other major arrival.         
	Earlier, Milan released a statement announcing their success in buying Ronaldinho. AC Milan and FC Barcelona have reached an agreement for the transfer of Ronaldinho, said the statement released on the clubs official website on Tuesday.         
	Barcelona and Milan officials held talks in the Catalan capital on Tuesday to thrash out the details of the 28-year-olds move. A magazine reported that Milan will pay Barcelona $29.5 million for the World Cup winner with the figure likely to be increased by performance-related bonuses. The news of the deal was a blow to English Premier League side Manchester City.         
	Ronaldinho, who was not wanted at the Nou Camp by new Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola following a dip in form last season, scored 70 goals in 145 appearances for the Spanish side.         
	Meanwhile, Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti is looking forward to having Ronaldinho in his team as the San Siro giants aim to bounce back from their disappointing 2007/2008 season which saw them finish in fifth place in Serie A and miss out on Champions League qualification.         
	The important thing is to have quality players and Ronaldinho is without doubt one of those, Ancelotti said.         
	He added that the team will line up so as to make best use of the Brazilian and his Brazil teammate Kaka, with the pair playing behind either veteran Italy international striker Filippo Inzaghi or teenage Brazilian sensation Alexander Pato.         
	We will play with a 4-3-2-1 formation. Its a model that has worked well for us and brought us great satisfaction. Its our trademark and it will be again this year, with or without Ronaldinho. Our only objective is to win playing good football. This is Milan, he added.

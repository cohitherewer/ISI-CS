            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Brad Hodge                           
	Calcutta: Australian Brad Hodge, a middle-order batsman, has been added to the Kolkata Knight Riders squad in the Indian Premier League.         
	Hodge arrived early on Wednesday and then accompanied the Sourav Gangulys to Jaipur for Thursdays face-off against the Rajasthan Royals, a team underestimated by most.         
	Its a fact that Ricky Ponting and Brendon McCullum have returned home and Chris Gayle cant play, but Salman Butt arrived a few days ago and Hodge has landed too, coach John Buchanan told The Telegraph before leaving for Jaipur.         
	Buchanan added: We dont need any replacements... Its about backing the players weve got and finding the right combination.         
	According to Buchanan, Gayle wouldnt need surgery. He has a tear in the groin region and is on rehab. Surgery wont be necessary.         
	Buchanan declined to comment on the Shoaib Akhtar issue, but did say: Weve got a good bowling unit, with Umar Gul yet to play.

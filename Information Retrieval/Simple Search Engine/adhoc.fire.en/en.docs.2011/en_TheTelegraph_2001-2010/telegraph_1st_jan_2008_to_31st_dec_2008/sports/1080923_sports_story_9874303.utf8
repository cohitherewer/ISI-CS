            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi : Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on Monday said it would look for a new coach after M.K. Kaushik decided to join the womens national team in Bangalore .         
	Kaushik, who was appointed the mens team coach by the IOA ad hoc committee on hockey last week, was directed by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) on Monday to take charge of the womens team in Bangalore .         
	According to Indian Womens Hockey Federation (IWHF) sources, Kaushik is likely to leave for Bangalore on Wednesday after meeting the SAI director general.         
	While Kaushik said he would go by the decision of his employers, the IOA secretary general Randhir Singh said the ad hoc committee would look for a new coach.         
	We consider both the mens and the womens team as the part of the same family, Randhir said. There is no difference between the two. We want both the teams to win gold medals in Olympics, he added.         
	If the IWHF wants to retain Kaushik as the coach, there is no problem. We will look for another coach, Randhir said. We should not do anything that will go against the interest of the womens team.

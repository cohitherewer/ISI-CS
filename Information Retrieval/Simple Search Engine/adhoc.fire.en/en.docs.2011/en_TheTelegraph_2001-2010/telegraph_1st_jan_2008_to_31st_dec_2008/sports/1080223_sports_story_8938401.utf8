The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rathore, Sethi unhappy
                                                   Rathore, Sethi unhappy
                      
	Mumbai: Sections of Indias sporting community fear that the Indian Premier League (IPL) will eat into sponsorship revenue that could have gone to athletes preparing for the Beijing Olympics in August.         
	The IPL, featuring a majority of the games leading international players in the eight franchises, will get underway on April 18 and is poised to become one of the most lucrative sporting events in Asia.         
	Indias thriving advertising industry sees the IPL as a potential goldmine in a retail-booming economy and the franchises are also looking to acquire individual sponsorships.         
	Indias medal hopes for the August Games are in shooting, where they have several prospects led by Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore who won a silver four years ago.         
	A mix of athletes from archery, boxing, athletics, wrestling and swimming have already qualified for the Games while a few more are hoping to make it.         
	Most of the athletes are finding in difficult to put together a budget for training and international competition in preparation for the games.         
	I would like to say many things, but things dont matter in India, Rathore said. Id rather conserve my energy.         
	Multiple world billiards champion Geet Sethi, a promoter of a sports fund dedicated to funding athletes with potential of winning India a first individual Olympic gold medal, voiced his concern on Thursday.         
	The fanatical obsession called cricket has just joined hands with the film world to create a new pastime (I consciously refrain from calling it sport) where it will gain even further visibility and media hype fuelled by both cricket and Bollywood, Sethi said in an article. This in turn will almost certainly divert sponsorship which could have gone to disciplines with a genuine chance of winning India that Olympic gold.         
	Lalit Bhanot, secretary of Indias athletics body, believes the IPL will have an impact on other disciplines in the long run. Sponsors will like to partner the cricket league for visibility, he said. It will no doubt affect all other sports in terms of funding.

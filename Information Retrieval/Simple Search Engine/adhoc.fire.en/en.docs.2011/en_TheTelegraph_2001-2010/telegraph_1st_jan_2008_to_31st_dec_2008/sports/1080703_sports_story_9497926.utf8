                                              Viv rates Lee among greats  Melbourne: West Indian batting legend Vivian Richards feels Australian Brett Lee is the most fiery pacer cricket has seen after the intimidating Caribbean quartet of Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner, Michael Holding and Curtly Ambrose.  Lee became the fastest bowler to claim 300 wickets in ODIs when he reached the milestone in his 171st match, against West Indies mdash; 15 games earlier than previous record holder Pakistani legend Waqar Younis. Richards also feels the Aussie has proved himself enough to be placed alongside the Windies greats.  ldquo;I think he rsquo;s certainly up there with those guys (Marshall, Holding, Garner and Ambrose), rdquo; Richards said. ldquo;I think it is hard to assess what took place from then to now ... But I think when he rsquo;s called upon to do it, he rsquo;s just as good as any. rdquo;  Test at CCI  Mumbai: It rsquo;s official now. Test cricket will return to its original home in Mumbai, the Cricket Club of India's Brabourne Stadium, after 35 years when it hosts the second match of the two-test rubber between India and England in December.
  quot;We (officials of Mumbai Cricket Association) had a meeting today with the Cricket Club of India (representatives) and it has been decided that Brabourne Stadium would host the second Test against England. It will be held between December 18 and 22, quot; informed MCA treasurer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty.   Oval Test  Karachi: In a moral victory for Pakistan cricket, the ICC has agreed in principle to convert the result of the 2006 rsquo;s controversial Oval Test between England and Pakistan into a draw from a forfeited win for Michael Vaughan rsquo;s men.  ldquo;The decision was taken at the board meeting on Wednesday with Pakistan pressing for the authorities to convert the result of the Oval Test result, rdquo; sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said.  Lord rsquo;s revamp  London: The architects behind Beijing rsquo;s ldquo;bird rsquo;s nest rdquo; Olympic Stadium were awarded another high-profile sports commission on Wednesday when they were given the job of designing the redevelopment of Lord rsquo;s.     Herzog and de Meuron have been selected by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the owners of Lord rsquo;s, to design the ldquo;masterplan rdquo;.   Gag on Gary   Mumbai: Team India coach Gary Kirsten and assistant Paddy Upton have been asked by the BCCI to stop airing post-match comments and writing columns on the former rsquo;s website lsquo;garykirsten.com rsquo;.   ldquo;He had already taken permission about his website, so there rsquo;s no issue there. But he cannot write post match comments or columns. The same holds true for Upton, too. That rsquo;s as per our policy, rdquo; BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty said on Wednesday.

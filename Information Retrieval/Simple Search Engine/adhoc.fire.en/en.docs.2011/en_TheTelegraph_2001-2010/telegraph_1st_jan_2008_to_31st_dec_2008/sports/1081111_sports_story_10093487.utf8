The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We were totally outplayed, admits Australia captain
                                                                                                                                                                                                       We were totally outplayed, admits Australia captain
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Ishant Sharma, who was adjudged Man of the Series, in Nagpur on Monday                           
	Nagpur: Ricky Ponting, under fire for Australias slow over rate and his choice of bowling on the fourth day of the fourth Test here, defended his tactics on Monday.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the criticism that he did not do enough to press for a win         
	Im a little bit disappointed with some of the criticism, particularly from former Australian captains and CA board members. I had Jason Krejza bowling at one end, who ended up taking 12 wickets in the game, and Cameron White, whod been the No. 1 picked spinner in the first three Test matches, operating from the other end for a couple of overs. That didnt work out the way Id have liked. Michael Clarke was the next choice, hed been off the field ill and couldnt bowl until 3.10pm.         
	We were nine overs down and as a captain I have a responsibility to play the game in the right spirit, an obligation to try to bowl 90 overs in the days play. If the quicks had continued then we wouldve been, maybe, 12 overs down. At no stage did I ever feel it was totally negative. With Cameron White, I actually felt hed have a good a chance of getting Harbahjan out.         
	On the accusation that he put his self ahead of team         
	Everyones got a point of view on how I captain the team and the way the team plays. The thing Im most disappointed about is there seems to be this inference out there that Ive put myself totally ahead of the team.         
	Anybody that knows me would hopefully not say thats the case. Id like to think as far as team players go that there havent been many more that have ever played for Australia that would do more than I have for the team.         
	On whether the issue of over rates was discussed by the team         
	We speak about it at every team meeting. Ive told the bowlers, the whole team, for a couple of years now that if we keep going the way we are theres going to be some time or moment where its really going to come back and hurt us or bite us. There have been other times where weve had to do that. I remember Perth last summer, we got down to eight or nine overs down there as well.         
	On his consulting with the bowlers between overs         
	That might be 30 seconds in an over, that doesnt equate to nine overs down. Nine overs is 35 minutes play, thats a lot of time lost, so we have to look at every possible way we can to ensure we dont get to an unacceptable level. Nine overs to me is totally unacceptable.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Almeria hold Barcelona 
                                                   Almeria hold Barcelona 
                      
	Madrid: Kalu Uche headed in an 85th-minute equaliser to give Almeria a 2-2 draw against 10-man Barcelona in the Spanish league on Sunday.         
	The Nigeria striker got in front of defender Eric Abidal and headed in a corner that could damage Barcelonas title hopes.         
	Barcelona failed to take advantage of Real Madrids 0-1 loss at Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday, only moving within seven points of their rivals instead of five.         
	Madrid lead the league with 62 points, followed by Barcelona with 55 with 10 games remaining. Bojan Krkic gave Barcelona the lead in the 17th minute. Andres Iniesta cut into the middle and sent in a low shot that was saved by Diego Alves, but the goalkeeper pushed the rebound straight into the path of Krkic.         
	Almeria equalised from a corner kick in the 33rd when Ruben Pulido sent an angled header past Victor Valdes.         
	Three minutes after replacing Edmilson, Thierry Henry moved past right back Aitor Lopez Recarte with his first touch before feeding the streaking Samuel Eto in the 57th for a 2-1 lead. But Barcelona were then reduced to 10 men in the 72nd when Gabriel Milito tripped Juan Manuel Ortiz for his second booking.         
	Uche got over Carles Puyol two minutes after his goal but headed over the bar as Almeria improved to 38 points.         
	In Italy, Inter Milan beat Palermo 2-1 to maintain their six-point lead in Serie A, with Patrick Vieira scoring his first goal of the season.         
	Vieira headed in a soft pass from Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the fifth minute. Palermo equalised in the 25th after an own-goal by Inter defender Marco Materazzi, but Luis Antonio Jimenez scored the winning goal in the 36th.

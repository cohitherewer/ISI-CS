	London: The Football Association has asked Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and his assistant Carlos Queiroz to explain comments they made after Saturdays 0-1 FA Cup defeat by Portsmouth.         
	In a TV interview, Ferguson, angry that a penalty had not been awarded to Cristiano Ronaldo, said referee Martin Atkinson had been on Portsmouths side. He also accused referees chief Keith Hackett of not doing his job properly.         
	Queiroz had described Atkinson as a robber.         
	The FA said in a statement on its website on Tuesday that it had written to both for explanations and that they had until next Wednesday to respond. (Reuters)

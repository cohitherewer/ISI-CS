                                                   Subhas: We are not BCCIs servants 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty on Wednesday said that the state government was not a dedicated servants of the Indian cric- ket board and hence was not compelled to abide by its diktat.         
	Criticising the tendency of the BCCI in India of setting its own terms and conditions, Chakraborty said: We are not the BCCIs servants. So we are not bound to act in accordance with their rules and regulations.         
	The minister also pointed out that the state government would not discriminate between the IPL and the ICL while allowing them to play matches at Eden Gardens.         
	If we can give the stadium to the IPL for playing their matches, we can also give it to the ICL, provided they apply in writing, he said at Writers Buildings.

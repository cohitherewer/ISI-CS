The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer, Munaf script victory
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zaheer, Munaf script victory
    - Butter-fingered fielders almost give it away after Dhonis superb knock                   Zaheer Khan is congratulated by teammates in Colombo on Sunday                           
	Colombo: India made mess of a brilliant start as they just managed to scrape through to a narrow 33-run win in the third one-dayer to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series, here on Sunday.         
	Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene scored 94 and brought his team close to the doors of an incredible victory but could not finish the game off as the hosts innings folded for 204 in 49 overs.         
	After scoring 237, India had the Lankans on the mat as the hosts were reduced to 94 for seven, but visitors dropped as many as four catches to put themselves in an embarrassing situation in the floodlit affair.         
	A sloppy fielding allowed Jayawardene  dropped once and Thilan Thushara  dropped twice  to stitch an 81-run stand, raising hopes of a Lankan win at R. Premadasa Stadium.         
	Zaheer Khan came to the rescue of his team when he bowled Thushara (30) with a yorker, but tension was still there as Jayawardene was still at the wicket. The Lankan skipper departed when he chipped one off Munaf Patel and Praveen Kumar held on to the chance.         
	Early during the Lankan chase, Zaheer and Praveen produced a devastating spell of seam bowling to put India on the victory path. Praveen and Zaheer shared five wickets between them after skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni led from front with his 76-run knock to help India put a fighting total on the board.         
	Jayawardene, dropped by Yuvraj Singh at 75 off Munaf, hit six fours and one six in his defiant knock as he waged a lone battle from one end and saw his teammates, barring Thushara, depart one after another from the other. Thushara, after being dropped by Rohit Sharma at slip and by S. Badrinath at long on, did his bit with two boundaries.         
	Munaf claimed three wickets while Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj Singh chipped in with a wicket each. Opening the bowling, Praveen asked questions straight away, beating explosive Sanath Jayasuriya with off-the-seam movement a couple of times.         
	Praveen was rewarded for the good work when Jayasuriya offered a low catch in covers, but he was dropped by Virat Kohli. The meerut pacer, however, had the last laugh when the left-hander edged one to Dhoni.         
	Zaheer, bowling with good pace, was not far behind as he plotted the fall of other opener Kumar Sangakkara with a beautiful in swinger. He trapped Sangakkara with a gem of a delivery and umpire Billy Doctrove had no hesitation in raising his finger.         
	Kapugedara, who got off the mark with an elegant cover drive, hit Praveen for a six through mid-wicket, trying to break the shackles. But Praveen got the revenge two balls later when he caught him plumb in front of the wicket and the umpire issued his marching orders.         
	It looked that Indian pacers were involved in a race to outshine each other as Zaheer struck for the second time exactly six balls later.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Player retirements to test India: Ricky
                                                Player retirements to test India: Ricky
                                
	Ricky Ponting Monday said it would be interesting to see how India back up after four or five of their top players go in a few months. Talking to the reporters at the news conference in Adelaide, the Australian skipper said they went through a similar phase of rebuilding over last few months.         
	The following are excerpts:         
	On his assessment of the series         
	Its been a terrific series Weve played very good Test match cricket right from the start It was criticised that our performance in the first two games could have been better Looking back, I would say it would have been nice to win tosses in Perth and here. Ive been really proud of the way things went. I said at the toss before the game that our first innings total would be vital. Actually our batters gave a glimmer of hope of actually wining the Test. At the end of the day, there was only one team that could win the Test and that was us.         
	On when he thought a result was not possible         
	The chances of winning at the lunch time was pretty slim. In the morning, wed had to keep the run rate down and keep taking wickets. Unfortunately, with (Virender) Sehwag being out there, he keeps the scoreboard ticking pretty quickly. His innings took the game away. It made us feel reasonably unrealistic to win the game         
	On losing one more player (Adam Gilchrist) now         
	Well, it has been right through the summer Weve coped really well with the loss of the four (Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Justin Langer and Damien Martin) at the end of the last season. Weve coped well with the loss of four players last summer and now weve lost one more. Our cricket this summer has been terrific, especially the way weve covered for these guys.         
	On maintaining the no. 1 ranking         
	Weve got enough talent around Australia to maintain our No. 1 ranking in Tests. Weve done a lot of work over a period of time and are a fair bit ahead of the next team. Test cricket is about big moments and weve won most of those through the summer. How we adapt and adjust from hereon would determine how good a team we are.         
	Finally, on India being ranked no. 2 in Tests now         
	Even though theyre the No. 2 ranked team in the world, theyre going to lose 4-5 of their best players pretty soon. Theyre going to go through a very similar phase that weve gone through in the next 12 months. It will be interesting to see how they back up from that.           A CORRESPONDENT IN ADELAIDE

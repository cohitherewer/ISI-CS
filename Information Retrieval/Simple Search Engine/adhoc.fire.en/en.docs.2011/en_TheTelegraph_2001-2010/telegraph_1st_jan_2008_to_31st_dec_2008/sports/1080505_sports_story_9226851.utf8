	Mumbai: Skipper Shaun Pollock led from the front as Mumbai Indians defended a small total to stun leaders Delhi DareDevils by 29 runs for their second successive win in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) at the D.Y. Patil Stadium on Sunday.         
	After being restricted to 162 for eight, the hosts bowled with purpose and struck at timely intervals to skittle out the Virender Sehwag led Delhi team for 133 in 18.5 overs.         
	The bowling heroes for the struggling home team, who brought up the rear going into their sixth match, were stand-in captain Pollock (two for 16) and Ashish Nehra, who bagged three for 25 including two back-to-back wickets.         
	The superb display by the senior bowlers inspired youngster Dhawal Kulkarni to grab the final two Delhi batsmen and finish with two for 18.         
	But the most telling blow was struck by Dominic Thornely who, after being introduced as the sixth bowler dismissed the flamboyant Delhi opener Sehwag with a low full toss.         
	Sehwag gave the Delhi Daredevils chase the early momentum with a quick-fire 40 off only 20 balls, inclusive of three sixes and as many fours, in his inimitable fashion after the visitors were put on the back foot at four for two.         
	He also added a crucial 45 runs with Shoaib Malik for the fourth wicket after AB de Villiers was run out backing too far to a firm drive from Sehwag which got deflected on to the non-strikers end stumps by the bowler. Sehwag seemed to be on a roll and his dismissal at 82 in the 11th over simply unhinged the Delhi line-up and also brought the Mumbai Indians back into the game.         
	Malik (24) and Dinesh Karthik (28) kept them in the fight before departing in the space of two overs and the rest simply caved in as Delhi suffered their second defeat in six ties.         
	Earlier, Mumbai Indians batting failed to prosper yet another time after being asked to take first strike. The home teams batting sparkled sporadically with no batsman willing to bat till the end, and they finished with what seemed an inadequate total on a good pitch.         
	Veteran Sanath Jayasuriya (34), newcomer Yogesh Takawale (14), Thornely (30) and Robin Uthappa (22), in the top order, got starts but failed to make them count as the Delhi Daredevils struck at regular intervals to stop their progress.         
	After a opening stand of 46 between their new pair of wicketkeeper Takawale and veteran Jayasuriya  who looked in supreme touch and struck one six and six fours in his 16-ball knock  the innings went into a decline before being propped up by Thornely and Uthappa.         
	The third wicket pair put on 52 runs in 36 balls but once this stand between Thornely, and Uthappa was broken, there was a steep slide.

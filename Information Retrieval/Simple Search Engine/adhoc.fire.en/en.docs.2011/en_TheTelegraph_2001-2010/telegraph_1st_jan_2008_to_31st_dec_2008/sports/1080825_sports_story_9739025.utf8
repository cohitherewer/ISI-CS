The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Massa revives title challenge with win
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Massa revives title challenge with win
                  Felipe Massa after his win on Sunday                     
	Valencia: Felipe Massa and Lewis Hamilton each had their own reasons to feel relieved on Sunday after finishing first and second in a processional European Grand Prix.         
	Massas win on the streets of Valencia wiped away the Ferrari drivers disappointment at retiring from the Hungarian Grand Prix three weeks earlier with a blown engine while leading with three laps remaining.         
	The Brazilian, who drove from pole position to chequered flag in masterful fashion, climbed the podium with the race outcome still uncertain pending a stewards enquiry.         
	In the end he escaped with a euro 10,000 fine, with stewards deciding that while his release from his second pit-stop had been unsafe there was no sporting advantage gained.         
	McLarens Hamilton, now six points clear of Massa in the drivers standings, was happy to have limited the damage after flu symptoms and a painful neck had made the 23-year-old Britons participation doubtful.         
	The win catapulted Massa back to second place in the championship, ahead of teammate and world champion Kimi Raikkonen who retired in the closing stages with another spectacular engine failure.         
	Hamilton now leads with 70 points to Massas 64 and Raikkonens 57.         
	Ferrari stayed top of the constructors standings with 121 points to McLarens 113 and BMW Saubers 96.         
	Polands Robert Kubica took third place for BMW Sauber despite a steering imbalance caused by a plastic bag blowing across the track and becoming wedged underneath his car during the early laps.         
	Raikkonen, without a win since the Spanish Grand Prix in April, bungled his second pit-stop and injured a mechanic when he set off before the fuel nozzle had been removed. That incident was also the subject of a stewards inquiry.         
	Fernando Alonso suffered the biggest disappointment, with Spains double world champion forced to retire after the opening lap when his Renault was hit by Kazuki Nakajimas Williams.         
	In the Force India cars, Italian Giancarlo Fisichella finished in 14th position following a one-stop race, while Adrian Sutil retired on lap 42.           (REUTERS)

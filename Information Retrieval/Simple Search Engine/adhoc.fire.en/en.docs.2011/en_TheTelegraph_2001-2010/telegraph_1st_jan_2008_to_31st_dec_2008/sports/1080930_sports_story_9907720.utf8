The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gilchrist replaces Laxman at helm
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gilchrist replaces Laxman at helm
    - Darren LehmanN takes over as Deccan Chargers coach           A STAFF REPORTER            Adam Gilchrist                                 
	Calcutta: The Deccan Chargers on Monday appointed former Australia vice-captain Adam Gilchrist as their captain, replacing V.V.S. Laxman, who led the team in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Former Australia batsman Darren Lehmann was appointed coach replacing former India allrounder Robin Singh.         
	Star-studded Deccan Chargers were tagged favourites to win the title before the start of the inaugural IPL. But they had a disappointing competition, finishing last among the eight teams, with only two wins from 14 games.         
	Gilchrist led the team in eight of their 14 matches after Laxman suffered a wrist injury. Its a tremendous thrill and honour to become captain of the Deccan Chargers. I look forward to working hard with everybody towards making the team successful, Gilchrist said.         
	I am confident Adam Gilchrist will unite Deccan Chargers outstanding talent, said Tim Wright, chief executive of the Hyderabad-based team, in a statement.         
	Adam Gilchrist commands respect within the team and right around the cricket world. He has redefined the role of wicketkeeper-batsman in modern cricket, he added.         
	We are delighted to be giving Darren Lehmann his first post as coach and have no doubt he will be a great success.         
	The Chargers have the likes of Andrew Symonds, Herschelle Gibbs, Scott Styris, Shahid Afridi and Rohit Sharma in their ranks, besides Gilchrist and Laxman.         
	It may be recalled that a war of words had erupted between Laxman and Afridi after the latter had commented to a Pakistani channel that Gilchrist would be a better choice to lead the Deccan Chargers and that Twenty20 did not suit Laxmans style of play.         
	The team later launched an inquiry into the spat between them.

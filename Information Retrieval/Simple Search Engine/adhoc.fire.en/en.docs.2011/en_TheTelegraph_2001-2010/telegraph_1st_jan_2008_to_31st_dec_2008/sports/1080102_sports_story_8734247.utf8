	Chennai: Rajeev Ram may have notched the biggest win of his career making the pre-quarters of the ATP Chennai Open but he insists that its just the beginning. 
    
	The American of Indian origin, who unlike many of his ilk chose to earn his living doing what he loves, aims to be within the top 100 next year. 
    
	I am hitting more cleanly than ever and hope to break into the top 100 by 2009 which will help me get in directly into the main draw of the Chennai and Australian Open, he said. 
    
	Rajeevs Chennai Open dream is likely to die an early death since he runs into the hot favourite world No.2 Rafael Nadal in the next round. He is not intimidated but excited at the prospect. I am really excited to have this opportunity and hope to give him a good fight, he said. 
    
	He is quite aware of his Indian roots  I am proud of my heritage  but wants to stick to playing for his adopted country in the near future. 
    
	Excited as I am by the prospect of representing India And the thought has crossed my mind many times, but I cant just ignore the USTA and the effort they have put in. Its a tough choice but I have made up my mind, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi, Paes to play in Beijing
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bhupathi, Paes to play in Beijing
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi during the Doha Asian Games                           
	New Delhi: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi have finally decided to put aside their differences and team up for the Beijing Olympics in August.         
	According to All India Tennis Association (AITA) sources, the duo agreed to join hands after AITA secretary general Anil Khanna met them in Paris on Monday night and persuaded them to play together in the interests of the nation.         
	While Khanna described Paes and Bhupathi as true patriots, who have agreed to put in their best efforts to win an Olympic medal for the country, AITA insiders said that Khanna played his cards carefully to force the warring duo to come together.         
	The meeting between Khanna and the two players didnt last long as Khanna made it clear that fans back home were completely disappointed with the behaviour of the two senior players, sources said.         
	The AITA secretary has reportedly pointed out that Bhupathi would do no favour to his image by refusing to play with Paes in the Olympics. At the same time, Khanna agreed to Bhupathis demand that the two players should pair up in a few tournaments before boarding the flight to Beijing.         
	Lee and Hesh have decided to pair up for two ATP Tour events before the Olympics. The first will be a week before Wimbledon on grass in Shertongenbosch, Holland. A couple of weeks later they will play in a hardcourt meet in Indianapolis, Khanna said.         
	Just before going to Beijing and after Cincinnati, Lee and Hesh will get together for a few days training programme with Leanders coach Rick Leach and Maheshs coach Scott Davidoff and a trainer.         
	Both players will reach Beijing for the opening ceremony and will have training sessions there too for a few days before the competition begins, the AITA boss added.         
	Later, speaking to The Telegraph, Paes said he was comfortable with the arrangement. I have maintained all along that we must set aside our differences to play together for the country, he said.         
	I am glad that this issue has finally been sorted out. After all, India is bigger than either of us. We should now work together to win a medal at the Olympics, Paes said.         
	Bhupathi, too, was happy. The main concern was that we were not going to be prepared, he said. It should be okay, it is better than nothing.         
	AITA sources also pointed out that the first-round exit in the French Open also put Bhupathi in an awkward position. The defeat might cost him the ninth place in the doubles rankings. In case he doesnt figure in the top 10, Bhupathi wont be in a position to demand for his own partner at the Olympics.

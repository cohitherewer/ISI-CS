The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | China drop 22 gold medallists
                                                                                                                                                                                           China drop 22 gold medallists

	Beijing: More than half of Chinas gold medallists from the Athens Olympics have been purged from the countrys team, some allegedly for political reasons.         
	Although China is determined to top the medal tables at the Beijing Games next month, its sports administrators have taken the draconian decision to drop 22 gold-medal winning athletes.         
	China won 32 gold medals in Athens, and is hoping to top the 40 mark in Beijing.         
	Some of the athletes were forced out by injuries or strong competition, but a Chinese newspaper, thought to be the mouthpiece of the government, also said politics had played a part.         
	There were some surprising exclusions... who would have had a realistic shot at winning gold next month, it said.         
	The most obvious political victim was Tian Liang, nicknamed the diver prince after winning gold medals in the 10 metre platform dive at Sydney and Athens.         
	Tian was kicked off the national team in 2005 for endorsing everything from wooden floors to seafood snacks. He was producing a negative influence on the preparation for the 2008 Olympics, said an official. He also hit the gossip columns for his relationship with Guo Jingjing, a fellow diver. She managed to stay on the team after she publicly denounced her behaviour.         
	Other notable exclusions included Zhu Lin, the 2007 world badminton womens singles champion, and Zhu Ting, a football forward.         
	Other athletes have been forced to compete despite longing for retirement. Yang Wenjun, the gold medallist in flatwater canoeing in Athens, said the authorities had threatened to withhold his pension if he did not compete in Beijing.         
	Susan Brownell, the author of Beijings Games: What the Olympics mean to China, said: Whenever you have athletes appointed by coaches you get accusations of politics and it has happened before in China.         
	However, she said the motives would be to win more medals.         
	Countries have expressed concerns about the lack of freedom of speech and expression in communist China, and these reports would only add fuel to the allegations.         
	China had promised to the International Olympic Committee that international guests would not face any diffculty to cover the Games because of the law of the land. While that promise has not always been kept, the plight of the Chinese, some people allege, is worse.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Draw takes Anand to joint lead
                                                     Draw takes Anand to joint lead
                  Viswanathan Anand                     
	Morelia (Mexico): World champion Viswanathan Anand was held to an easy draw by Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan but moved into joint lead as overnight leader Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria was outplayed by Spaniard Alexei Shirov in the fourth round of the Morelia-Linares Chess Tournament here.         
	Anand was, once again, deprived of a win with white as he could not do much after he was surprised early in the opening and the match was drawn in the middle game with many pieces still on board.         
	The Indian ace had lost his previous game with white pieces against Levon Aronian of Armenia.         
	Anand took his personal tally to 2.5 points out of a possible 3 and is now atop the table along with Topalov and a lucky Aronian, who scored over Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, thanks to a blunder by the latter.         
	Shirov jumped to the joint fourth spot with his first victory in the tournament and now shares that position with Peter Leko of Hungary while Radjabov, Magnus Carlsen of Norway and Ivanchuk are now in joint sixth spot on 1.5 points apiece in the event which is being played in two parts: first half here and the second half at Linares.         
	It was a ruy lopez wherein Radjabov surprised Anand early, going for an off-beat Schliemann variation and it was clear that the Azerbaijani got adequate counter play for a lost pawn in the opening.         
	The game progressed only till move 22 when Anand accepted the draw proposal in an unclear situation.         
	Playing white, Shirov faced the Sicilian Sveshnikov from Topalov who apparently equalised with exchanges of pieces at regular intervals.           (PTI)

      HONKY DORY
            
	Mumbai: Contrary to expectations, less-fancied runners ruled the nine-event card on Saturday, the first of the two-day racing carnival, featuring the Indian Derby. Although, the victory of the course-favourite in the opener, the United Spirits Challenge, was treated as a good omen, things never, however, worked in favour of the race crowd, subsequently.
     
	The outcome in the main attraction, the Breeders Produce Stakes, was no different when two long-priced horses, Autonomy and Set Alight, flashed past the winning post. They left the fancied runners - Palazzios Sun and Star Wave -- a beaten pair a furlong from the home. Autonomy won the race but failed to keep the prize in the stewards room.
     
	The race was run at a fast pace which weighed heavy on the Bangalore challenger, Palazzios Sun (Dettori-up), who was always up with the leaders. Star Wave, on the other hand, looked a trifle light in the paddock and it hardly came as a surprise when the 9-4 favourite struggled to finish fourth. Her debut win highly impressive.

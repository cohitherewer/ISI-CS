The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Turkey hard to figure out: Loew
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Turkey hard to figure out: Loew
                      
	Tenero: Germany coach Joachim Loew has coached in Turkey and knows the country well. Still, he has trouble figuring out their national team.         
	Germany will meet Turkey in the European Championship semi-finals on Wednesday in Basel.         
	The Turks have shown throughout the tournament that you cant count them out no matter what the score in the game is, Loew said. They are hard to figure out and therefore dangerous.         
	Loew coached Fenerbahce during the 1998-99 season and also had a brief stint at Adanaspor. I have many friends there with whom I am in regular contact, Loew said.         
	Turkey have come from behind in three games, most memorably in the quarter finals against Croatia on Friday when they scored on the last kick of the game in extra time to equalise after conceding a goal only a minute earlier. Turkey then won the penalty shootout. (Reuters)

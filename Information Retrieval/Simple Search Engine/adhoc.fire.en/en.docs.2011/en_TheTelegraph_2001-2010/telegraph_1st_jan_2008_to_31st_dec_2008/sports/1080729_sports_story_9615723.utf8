            IN amp; OUT                  Tottenham Hotspurs insistence on a British-record transfer fee of 38 million for Bulgarian forward Dimitar Berbatov has led Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to switch his attentions to Barcelonas Thierry Henry. Although Berbatov remains Fergusons number one choice, the United manager has also drawn up a list of alternatives that includes Blackburn Rovers front man Roque Santa Cruz.         
	Bid rejected         
	 Sporting Lisbon have confirmed they have turned down a 11.8m offer from Everton for their highly rated Portuguese international midfielder Joao Moutinho.

	Robinho ready         
	 Real Madrid winger Robinho has agreed on personal terms with Chelsea after the club made an initial $31.5m bid for the playmaker, but Real will not let the move happen until they have a replacement equivalent in stature.         
	Lampard deal         
	 Frank Lampard has reportedly won the battle for a new five-year contract with Chelsea. It has been reported that the England star will sign the new deal, worth 150,000 a week, when the club return from their pre-season tour.         
	EPL scramble

	Liverpool target         
	 Villa midfielder Gareth Barry, who has been targeted by Liverpool, is to be offered a new four-year contract at Villa Park that would result in him earning as much as a 50% pay rise.         
	Baptista in demand         
	 Newcastle are prepared to pay 7m for Real Madrids former Arsenal forward Julio Baptista, although the Spanish club want closer to 12m. Real themselves want a new striker and will turn to Valencias David Villa in a 30m deal that will end their interest in Cristiano Ronaldo.

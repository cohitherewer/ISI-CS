The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Buzz over, its time to fire
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Buzz over, its time to fire
    - Chris Gayle unlikely to play today           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kolkata Knight Riders Ricky Ponting and Ishant Sharma during practice in Bangalore on Thursday. (PTI)                                 
	Bangalore: Theres much riding on the Indian Premier League (IPL), not least being millions of bucks. Come Friday, of course, and it will be time for it to move beyond the buzz stage.         
	On test wont just be the Twenty20 skills of the biggest names in contemporary cricket (including the recently retired ones), barring a few like Brian Lara and Inzamam-ul Haq, Andrew Flintoff and Michael Clarke, but the business model adopted by the Shah Rukh Khans.         
	Its something new Its something exciting but a lot of things need to work for it to be successful, is what former India captain Rahul Dravid, wholl be leading the formidable Bangalore Royal Challengers, said.         
	He couldnt have put it any better.       
	Dravid added: Im sure therell be teething problems Im sure issues will crop up, but a start has been made and lets see how it goes The IPL is going to be a success if people support it and want to see it         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders captain, Sourav Ganguly, told The Telegraph: Its a new concept, yes, but I have no reason to believe its not going to be a success         
	In his view, the presence of the top guns from across the world (except England) guarantees that the IPL will be a hit.                     
	As for the first-day-first-show bit, Sourav and Dravids teams (or Shah Rukh and Vijay Mallyas) will be battling it out at the Chinnaswamy here.         
	Incidentally, both captains are convinced that no one team is going to begin the competition as the favourite.         
	All have strengths and weaknesses, with no one team being the clear favourite The Knight Riders, in my view, have plenty of firepower upfront but weve got a balanced team, Dravid pointed out.         
	For Bangalore, Anil Kumble isnt fit, but Zaheer Khans raring to go.         
	The West Indies captain, Chris Gayle, will arrive early on Friday, but its highly unlikely that hes going to play for the Knight Riders in the opener.         
	One understands Debabrata Das and Iqbal Abdullah wont be in the XI either.         
	While the match begins at 8.00 pm, the opening ceremony has been scheduled for between 6.30-7.15pm.

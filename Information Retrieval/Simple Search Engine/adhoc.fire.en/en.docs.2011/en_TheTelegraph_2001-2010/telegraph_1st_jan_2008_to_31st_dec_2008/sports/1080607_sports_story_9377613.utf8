The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not missing Asif: Malik
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Not missing Asif: Malik
                      
	Dhaka: The bowling attack has enough firepower even without pace spearhead Mohammed Asif and there is no reason why Pakistan cannot sustain the same consistency in the tri-series which has helped them win their previous 11 matches on the trot, said Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik.         
	Our target is to maintain the consistency that saw us winning 11 games in a row. We want to continue that streak, Malik told at a press conference on Friday.         
	Everyone is fit and we are looking forward to a good series. We have our first game against Bangladesh. They have proved themselves at home if you look at their matches against South Africa and our team recently.         
	And though the team arrived in Dhaka without their pace spearhead, Malik asserted the team had enough depth and Asifs absence after the pacer was detained in Dubai airport on Sunday for allegedly carrying contraband drugs, would not be felt.         
	We still have a decent bowling attack in Umar Gul, Wahab Riaz, Sohail Tanvir and Bazid Khan. They have been working hard throughout, the captain said.         
	Coach Geoff Lawson said Asifs detention will hamper the pacers progress to find form.         
	He was in the team as he had been making a successful comeback from his injury mostly through IPL. The tri-series would have a step towards full form for him. From that point of view this incident is disruptive and could hamper his progress and return to full form, Lawson said.         
	Senior pro Mohammed Yousuf, however, on Friday said the team would miss the pace duo of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif during the tri-series. (PTI)

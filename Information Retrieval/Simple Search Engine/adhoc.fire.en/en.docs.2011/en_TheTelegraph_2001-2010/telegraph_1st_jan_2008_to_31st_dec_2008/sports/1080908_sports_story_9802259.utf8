	Calcutta: After the successful completion of its inaugural league, the West Bengal Table Tennis Association (WBTTA) is planning to go the Indian cricket boards way to make things interesting for next years edition.         
	The Bengal Premier League (BPL), like the Indian Premier League (IPL), is likely to allow a foreign paddler in each team from its next years edition. While the IPL allows four foreign players to play, there can be one foreign player in each team in the BPL.         
	According to a WBTTA official, each team in the league will be allowed to rope in at least one overseas player in their lineup.         
	We are planning to make things more exciting from next year. This year we experimented with options and have seen that there are ways to make things different, a senior WBTTA official said on Sunday.         
	We are likely to follow the IPL format. And in that case we will include outstation players besides local players. This will make the tournament more competitive and eventually it may turn out to be a prestigious event in the country, the official said.         
	In the first edition of the league, six local teams including three big clubs  Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting  participated. SAI, Stag and Rungta Group were the other three teams.         
	It was also learnt that few city-based clubs  United SC, Aryan, Tollygunge Agragami  have shown interest to play next year.         
	In the final on Sunday, Stag International emerged champions defeating Rungta Group 4-1 in the ONGC Bengal Premier League. Ranabir Das of the Stag team was adjudged the man of the match while Anirban Nandi of the Rungta outfit bagged the player of the tournament trophy.

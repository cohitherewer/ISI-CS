	Colorado Spring: After his three-month-old daughter died in an automobile accident in 2003, Daniel Cormier said all the things he thought he was supposed to say.         
	He competed in freestyle wrestling at the World Championships that year, and again at the 2004 Olympic Games. Each time, he talked about wrestling for his daughter, winning medals, rising to world champion. For her. Always, he said for her.         
	The more he said these things, the more he felt the pressure to do them. The more pressure he felt, the worse he wrestled. The worse he wrestled, the more he felt like a failure. The more he felt like a failure, the less he came to grips with his daughters death.         
	It was a vicious cycle, Cormier said. Not even a man my size can compete with the weight of a dead child on his shoulders.         
	Cormier knows loss in the way only a man with his background can. He lost his father to a shooting on Thanksgiving Day at age 7, lost a cousin and a football teammate in separate car accidents, and lost his college buddy, Daniel Lawson, when a plane carrying the Oklahoma State basketball team crashed.         
	Still, sitting in the windowless and pungent wrestling room here in late July, Cormier looks remarkably happy. Maybe that is because he is finally wrestling for himself.         
	Your mind is different when youre at peace with everything, Cormier said. You feel 20 pounds lighter when you live life without regret.         
	The last time Cormier made the Olympic freestyle wrestling team, at the same weight of 96 kilograms, he felt like he had accomplished something.         
	Expectations had been high since Cormier made his first world team, in 2003. The freestyle national coach, Kevin Jackson, saw in Cormier the same talent that led Jackson to World Championships and Olympic gold.         
	Not just a medal, but a gold medal, Jackson said. Weve been expecting it. Its safe to say he has not wrestled to his potential yet.         
	At the Athens Games, in the bronze medal match, Cormier led, 2-0, with less than a minute remaining. He lost, 3-2.         
	I feel like theres nothing to lose, Cormier said this time round. And if I would lose, Im not letting my daughter down. Im not letting my family down. Im not letting myself down.

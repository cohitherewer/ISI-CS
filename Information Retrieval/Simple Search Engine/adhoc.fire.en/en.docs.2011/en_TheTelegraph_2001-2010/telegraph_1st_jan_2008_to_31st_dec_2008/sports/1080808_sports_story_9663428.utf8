  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  In-form Team India opener takes strike in colombo         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Colombo: With scores of 3 has been doing his bit for Team India in Sri Lanka.         
	The 26-year-old, who has finally shaken off the label of a one-day specialist, spoke to The Telegraph (at the Taj Samudra) in the lead-up to the third and final Test.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Q Youd been desperate to make a Test comeback. How does it feel after two matches?         
	A Any cricketer would like to play as many Tests as possible and its no different with me... Im living a dream... When Im through with cricket, Id like people to talk of my Test achievements... Id expected it to be challenging in Sri Lanka and thats just how it has turned out.         
	Were you nervous before taking guard in the first Test (at the Sinhalese Sports Club here)?         
	I was very, very nervous in the lead-up to that Test... Having played a lot of Twenty20 and 50-over ODIs in recent months, I knew I had to quickly adapt... That I had to go with a different frame of mind... However, I wasnt short on confidence and backed myself to give the team good starts.         
	You looked set in both innings, but didnt get a big one...         
	Its disappointing that I got out for 39 and 43, but what was more disappointing is that we suffered our third heaviest defeat... That really hurt...         
	What was your frame of mind before the second Test, in Galle?         
	Id been positive... Actually, I took some positives away from the first Test... I was happy with my balance... Happy with my mental make-up... I wanted to concentrate for longer periods and I was able to do that... In ODIs, for example, you can afford to get carried away. Not so in Tests.         
	Youve been picking Ajantha Mendis very well. Perhaps, you could give some tips to teammates...         
	Mendis is a bit different because of the variety he has, but he isnt unplayable... You cant assume hell throw this ball or that... Youve got to watch his fingers... Ive been reacting to what hes bowling instead of worrying about the ball he could bowl. But, yes, Mendis is accurate.         
	Its widely held that openers play the quicks better...         
	(Interrupting) But the Indian batsmen are known to be very good against spin... I think playing against spinners in the hot-weather tournaments back in Delhi has helped... The pacers hardly bowl and the wickets are usually dusty with the ball turning square from very early on. To do well, youve got to overcome such odds. Also, facing quality spinners in national tournaments like the Ranji Trophy has been helpful... If you want to score big, youve got to be able to play them well... For long periods too.         
	You came on the tour after back-to-back one-day tournaments. Whats the adjustment you had to make?         
	Look, the only adjustment a professional cricketer has to make is in the mind... The basics, after all, remain the same... The technique doesnt change, its only that one has to be careful of the close-in catchers in Tests... The adjustment in the mind has to be quick because, really, theres no time going from one tournament to a series... Not being able to adjust will invite problems.         
	How different is your preparation for a Test series?         
	Its a mental thing and youve got to play a lot tighter... Specifically, youll have to cut down on some shots.         
	Whats it like opening with Virender Sehwag?         
	A dream of mine was to open with Viru in Tests... That has been realised... Hes such a terrific batsman... That were good friends off the field has made our on-field partnership stronger... We understand each other well and Viru was extremely supportive in the lead-up to the first Test, which marked my comeback... We play for the same state (Delhi), the same company (ONGC) and the same IPL team (Delhi DareDevils)... We do bond well together... Feel comfortable with each other.         
	Earlier this year, after a fantastic tri-series in Australia, were you disappointed at not getting a look-in during the home Tests against South Africa?         
	That stage has gone... Nowadays, I dont feel disappointed... Nowadays, Im wholly focused on giving my best shot in whatever the form I get opportunities in... Ultimately, you want to be happy... Stay calm... I try and control the things I can control... I cant, obviously, control matters of selection.         
	Does staying calm come naturally?         
	It does, nowadays... Perhaps, its because Im that much more mature... Earlier, Id worry about selection... Whether Ill be in the team or not... That stage is over... Its in my hands to get big runs and its in my hands to enjoy my cricket. Im doing that.         
	Are you afraid of failure?         
	(Grins) Ive started accepting it much better... Earlier, yes, Id be very afraid of failure... Ive now realised that life doesnt go in one direction and that what goes up will come down... One cant always score, but one cant also be hard on ones self.         
	Have you, now, cemented your place in the Team India XI in all forms?         
	The day I think that way will mean Ive begun to become casual... Im not one to take my place for granted.                 
	For a change, the attention isnt on our star-studded middle-order, but on Sehwag and you...         
	Everybody knows what our middle-order is capable of... Weve got four class batsmen (Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman)... I dont think attention is the issue, its about what your responsibilities are and how you discharge them... Those in better form have to take more responsibility.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten was himself a top-bracket opener. Is it of help having him around?         
	Yes, of course... Hes done some work with me... Hes asked me to concentrate harder and to play straighter in Tests... To play in the V... Ive been making a conscious effort to do that.         
	Finally, today, what are your thoughts on the deciding Test?         
	The momentum is with us, after Galle, and we need to build on that.

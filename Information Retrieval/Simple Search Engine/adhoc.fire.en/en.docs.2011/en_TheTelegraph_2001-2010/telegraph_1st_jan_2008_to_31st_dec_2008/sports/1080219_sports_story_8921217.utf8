The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff return likely today
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Flintoff return likely today   
	Mumbai: England allrounder Andrew Flintoff is likely to play his first competitive match in nearly five months for the visiting England Lions team against Mumbai XI led by Amol Muzumdar in a practice tie at the Brabourne Stadium here Tuesday.  
	Hes available for selection. I cant say now whether he will play or not. We have a team meeting later. If he plays, its up to the captain to decide whether he will play only as a batsman, teams media manager Mark Ward said. Flintoff underwent an ankle surgery in September and has been out of action since then.         
	The 30-year-old Lancashire cricketer has come to India for pre-season training but did not take part in the Duleep Trophy tournament with the England Lions. The Lions will play three practice ties here during the week before departing home.         
	Joyce unhappy         
	 Mumbai: England Lions batsman Edmund Ed Joyce believes that touring India has been the most difficult experience for him due to the weather and different types of pitch conditions the country has to offer.         
	We have to deal with different aspects of the game like the playing time which is quite early according to us, the weather, culture, food and also the massive difference in the types of wickets the place has to offer, he said. But despite these aspects, its a learning experience for the simple reason that the players who can adapt here early can perform well at the highest level.         
	The left-handed Middlesex batsman said he is undergoing a bad phase, especially after his good start to his one day career, which involved a century against Australia in Sydney where England came back from the dead to win the CB series.         
	PCB hopeful         
	 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) expects the ICC to help convince the Australians to tour Pakistan next month. PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said he expected the world body to ensure that Pakistan got a fair deal according to the ICC Future Tours Programme (FTP).         
	We have already got a raw deal in the FTP and if Australia dont come as per schedule, we will just have three Tests this year and that too when India tour later this year in December, he said.         
	Pakistan and Australians cricket officials will be locked in a crucial meeting in Kuala Lumpur on the sidelines of the ICC chief executives meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.         
	Lawyer hired         
	 Karachi: The players banned by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for signing contracts with the rebel ICL have hired eminent lawyer S.M. Zafar to argue their case in the court. The decision by the board to not allow the players to play for their departments in domestic cricket is illegal and unlawful. It can be challenged in court, former Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, who turned out in the first edition of the Indian Cricket League in November-December, said.         
	Another ICL recruited player Imran Farhat said: Mr Zafar will represent us in this case which will be fielded after the general elections. We have waited for so long to go to court because of the circumstances in the country because of the elections.

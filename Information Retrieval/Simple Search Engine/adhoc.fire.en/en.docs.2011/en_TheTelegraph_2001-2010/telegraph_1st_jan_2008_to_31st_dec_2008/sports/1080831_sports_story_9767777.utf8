	New York: Indian Davis Cuppers Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes advanced to the pre-quarterfinals of mens doubles event of the US Open after winning their respective second round matches, though in contrasting manner.         
	The fourth-seeded Bhupathi-Mark Knowles pair dominated in their 6-3, 6-3 win over Swiss Yves Allegro and Horia Tecau of Romania.         
	The seventh-seeded Paes and Lukas Dlouhy overcame a second set lapse to quell the challenge of Eduardo Schwank of Argentina and Potito Starace of Italy 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 in their second round on Friday.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles of Bahamas did not face even a single breakpoint in their encounter and broke their rivals once in the first set and twice in the second to clinch the match in little over one hour.         
	Paes and his Czech partner Dlouhy quickly went ahead by pocketing the first set in 25 minutes, breaking their rivals once but Schwank-Starace fought back and drew parity by securing the second.         
	Paes-Dlouhy got into their elements in the decisive third set, which they won after converting one of the two chances they got.         
	Now Bhupathi-Knowles would take on Argentine pair of Maximo Gonzalez and Juan Monaco while Paes-Dlouhy face off against Rik de Voest of South Africa and Ashley Fisher of Australia.

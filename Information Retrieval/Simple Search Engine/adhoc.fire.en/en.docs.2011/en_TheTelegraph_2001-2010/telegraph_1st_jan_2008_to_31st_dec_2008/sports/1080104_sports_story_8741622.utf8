	Sydney: Australia may be just one shy of equalling the world record of 16 consecutive Test wins, but speedster Brett Lee on Thursday said the team was not wavering in its focus against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 
    
	We dont want to lose our focus. Its important we go out and enjoy ourselves in the middle and try to do our best. If we play well and enjoy, we might still see the 16th Test win happen, Lee said after India finished Day II at 216 for three in reply to the hosts 463. 
    
	V.V.S. Laxman was the player largely responsible for the Indian fightback, but Lee also feared a fightback from Sachin Tendulkar as well. 
    
	Tendulkar is a brilliant batsman, perhaps in the top two or three in the world. I have always looked forward to testing myself against him and am looking forward to it tomorrow, he said. 
    
	The Test has been mired with several umpiring blunders but Lee stood up for the officials saying the mistakes should be treated as human errors. 
    
	So much is being said about it but I really feel that it all evens out. Some days I find batsmen being reprieved after they have nicked me and, on other days, they are given out when they havent played me. It all balances out in the end, he pointed out.

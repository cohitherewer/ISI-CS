            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India slipped a spot to be ranked third in the latest Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship, released on Monday.         
	Riding on their comprehensive two-Test win over Bangladesh, South Africa toppled India and regained their second position.         
	However, India have a chance to reclaim lost ground if they win the upcoming two-Test series against England.         
	New Zealand slipped below the West Indies to eighth following their defeat to Australia. The Kiwis were just one ratings point ahead of the West Indies before the series but defeats in Brisbane and Adelaide meant they lost that slender lead.         
	The good news for Daniel Vettori and his team is that they have an immediate opportunity to claim the place back as they prepare to play host to the West Indies for a two-Test series later this month. Victory in that series would see New Zealand return to seventh in the table but a drawn series or defeat will leave the West Indies ahead.         
	In ICC ODI championship, third-placed India reduced the gap with South Africa, in second position, to a fraction of a ratings point following their successful ODI series against England.         
	With the postponement of the final two ODIs in the series, India lost the chance to go second on the table.         
	One more win for Dhonis men would have put them into second position but it wasnt to be and they will now have to wait until their next series for the opportunity to make further inroads.         
	England , on the other hand, have suffered the effects of that comprehensive series defeat by losing five ratings points and is now under pressure in sixth place from Sri Lanka , whose 5-0 series victory over Zimbabwe has put it within one point of Kevin Pietersens team.         
	Despite being competitive in several of those games, Zimbabwe loses further ground to Ireland in 10th position and is now only two ratings points in front of Kenya in 12th .         
	Australia are still on top of the Test and ODI championship.  Test Rankings  Teams: 1. Australia; 2. South Africa; 3. India; 4. Sri Lanka; 5. England; 6. Pakistan; 7. The West Indies; 8.

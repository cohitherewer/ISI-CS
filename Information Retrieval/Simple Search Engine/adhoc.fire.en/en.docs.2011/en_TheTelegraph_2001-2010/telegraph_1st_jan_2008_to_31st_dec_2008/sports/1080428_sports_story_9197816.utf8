The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Katich stars in Kings XI win 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Katich stars in Kings XI win 
                      
	Mohali: Lefthander Simon Katich scored a confident 75 to steer Kings XI Punjab to an easy four-wicket win over Delhi Daredevils in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match on Sunday.         
	This was the second successive victory for the hosts in three days and first defeat in the tournament for the Delhi team.         
	Chasing a modest target of 159, the Aussie playing his second match kept his cool despite losing his opening partner Karan Goel (1) and Kumar Sangakkara (4) and made the run chase look easy.         
	The 32-year-old was in total command hitting fluent shots, with pacers Farvez Mahroof and Mohammed Asif getting the stick.         
	Katich took just 52 balls to produce a scintillating knock, which was adorned with 11 boundaries and a six before running himself out following a mix-up with his skipper.         
	After Katich got out in the 14th over when the team score was 119, Yuvraj, who had come at the fall of Mahela Jayawardene (15), took his team to a smooth victory.         
	The skipper played a solid 40-run knock and hit the winning runs in the last over.         
	Asif bagged two wickets while Glenn McGrath, Yo Mahesh and Shoaib Malik took a wicket each for the DareDevils.         
	After crushing Rajasthan Royals in Delhi and Deccan Chargers in Hyderabad, DareDevils tasted their first defeat in the tournament.         
	The DareDevils team had a shaky start, electing to bat, losing their skipper Virender Sehwag (6) and Sikhar Dhawan (0) cheaply.         
	Having suffered first blow in the second over itself, Dhawan, the 22-year-old left-handed batsman, was the next to go in the third over when he was adjudged caught behind.         
	The Brett Lee delivery kissed Dhawans shoulder as he tried to glance it, but appeared not to have made contact.         
	With Lee and Irfan having completed two overs each, all eyes were on right-arm pacer Sreesanth, who came in at the first bowling change.         
	Sreesanth, whohas been in the news since Friday following the alleged slapping incident involving him and Harbhajan Singh, was hit for a boundary on his first ball by Shoaib Malik and ended giving up 25 runs in the two overs he bowled.         
	DareDevils opener Gautam Gambhir (18) continued playing his attacking game, charging out to VRV Singh, but eventually handed over an easy catch to Yuvraj.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Salman Butt stars in series whitewash 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Salman Butt stars in series whitewash 
                  Salman Butt on way to his century on Saturday                     
	Karachi: Opening batsman Salman Butt hit a career-best 136 to help Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 150 runs in the fifth one-day International Saturday and sweep the series 5-0.         
	Butt led Pakistan to 329 for nine off their 50 overs. In reply, Bangladesh were dismissed for 179 in 40.5 overs by paceman Mohammed Asif (three for 35) and Shahid Afridi (three for 40).         
	It was the Pakistan teams record 11th straight win in limited-overs games  one against India, five against Zimbabwe and five against Bangladesh.         
	Australia hold the record with 21 victories in a row.         
	Its a nice feeling to create a new record for Pakistan, said captain Shoaib Malik, who received the winning trophy from president Pervez Musharraf. The credit of this record goes to all the players, who really worked hard.         
	Butt hit 14 boundaries and a six in his 124-ball century. The lefthander took his tally of runs to 451 in the series after previous scores of 33, 76, 132, 74 and 136. Its the highest total by any batsman in a five-match one-day International series between two countries.         
	Butts teammate Mohammed Yousuf held the previous record  405 runs in five limited-overs games against Zimbabwe in 2002.         
	Asif wrecked the Bangladesh batting line-up with three wickets in five deliveries when he removed Junaid Siddique (six), Aftab Ahmed (zero) and Shakib Al Hasan (five).         
	Bangladesh slipped further to 71 for six when fast bowler Umar Gul, who ended with two for 41, had Tamim Iqbal (nine) caught behind and Misbah-ul Haq brilliantly caught captain Mohammed Ashraful (30) in the slips in Shahid Afridis first over.         
	Mahmudullah top-scored with 37 off 83 balls before he gave a simple catch in Guls return spell.         
	I came in thinking realistically that we lose 5-0, Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons said.         
	Our top four batsmen disappointed in the series, but we are happy that we made at least more than 200 (runs) thrice in the series.         
	Earlier, Bangladesh bowlers hit back briefly late in the Pakistan innings, but not before Butt shared a 179-run second wicket stand off 178 balls with Younis Khan (69).         
	Pacemen Mashrafe Mortaza (four for 65) and Shahadat Hossain (three for 76) were the top wicket-takers, but could not prevent the hosts going over 300 for the third time in the series.         
	The Butt-Khan partnership broke Pakistans previous 123-run record for second wicket against Bangladesh, set by Ramiz Raja and Saeed Anwar at Colombo during the Asia Cup in 1997.         
	Butt continued his run of good form after captain Malik won the toss and elected to bat first. The outfield was lightning quick and all Butt had to do was to place it just wide of the fielders to fetch the boundary. All this meant that the margin for error was minimal for the bowlers and once again it was Butt who made them pay.         
	Mortaza dismissed opener Kamran Akmal (10) in his third over before Khan and Butt began their partnership.         
	Butt got a lucky escape soon after completing his half century off 47 balls with eight boundaries when Mortaza dropped a hard two-handed catch at mid-on.         
	Khan  back in the team after missing previous two games due to personal reasons  raised his half-century off 61 balls with three fours and a straight six off spinner Mahmudullah.         
	Butts run-a-ball century came in the 30th over of the innings before Bangladesh struck briefly.         
	The visitors got some reprieve when both Butt and Khan fell in the space of 23 runs  thanks to some brilliant catching.         
	Khan was caught by Farhad Reza off Hossain while Shakib Al Hasan took a superb running catch to dismiss Butt in the 38th over off Abdur Razzak. Both teams play again Sunday in a single Twenty20 international in Karachi.

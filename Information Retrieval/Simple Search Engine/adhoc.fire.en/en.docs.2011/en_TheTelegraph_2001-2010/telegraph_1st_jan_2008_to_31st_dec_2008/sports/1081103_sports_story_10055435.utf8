            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                      
	New Delhi/Mumbai: Team India Test captain Anil Kumbles decision to quit from International cricket on Sunday, drew mixed reactions from former and present Indian and international cricketers.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically)         
	Bishan Singh Bedi: I think the writing was in the wall. I could feel it was coming. It think he could have played the Nagpur Test but injury might have expedited his decision. Anyway, India is proud of him and I wish him happy retirement.         
	Allan Border: He is a fantastic a cricketer and a great human being who played his game in the right spirit throughout his career. It is a sad day for Indian cricket. It actually came as a shock to us.         
	Ian Chappell: It is very difficult for somebody to get into his shoes. He is a cricketer who never compromised his dignity and always played with determination.         
	Kapil Dev: He is a true fighter, always had this never-say-die attitude and is thoroughly a true gentleman. He is a great ambassador of cricket.         
	Rahul Dravid: Kumbles career has been an extraordinary one. Its a career that should be celebrated. It has been a great privilege for me to have played with him.         
	Sourav Ganguly: He is in the class of Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the other greats. Anil is a fantastic player and will definitely be missed. Players like him can never be replaced. Taking more than six hundred Test wickets is a phenomenal feat.         
	V.V.S. Laxman: Anil has been a great inspiration and a role model.         
	Erapalli Prasanna: What Kumble has done for Indian cricket will never be forgotten. He is an unrivalled genius.         
	Ravi Shastri: He was a real, out and out professional. It is definitely a sad day for Indian cricket. He decided to retire absolutely at the right time.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth: He must have decided (to retire) during the course of the day. He spoke to me during tea time and said that he has decided to call it quits. Its the end of an era. It was an emotional moment for the team and me.         
	Sachin Tendulkar: Kumble is a true champion. I just told him its truly an honour and a privilege to have played with him. We started our careers around the same time and I have thoroughly enjoyed playing with him.         
	Dilip Vengsarkar: He has been a great soldier, match-winner and fighter to the core. He always showed a lot of passion and is a role model for youngsters. I never said he should retire. I only said that he should take a call. After all, every player takes pride in his performance and sets standards for himself. He was one of the greatest, there was no need for others to say.         
	S. Venkatraghavan: Kumble is the greatest spinner India has ever produced. He is such a great sportsman that he is hanging his boots without waiting for the managements call.

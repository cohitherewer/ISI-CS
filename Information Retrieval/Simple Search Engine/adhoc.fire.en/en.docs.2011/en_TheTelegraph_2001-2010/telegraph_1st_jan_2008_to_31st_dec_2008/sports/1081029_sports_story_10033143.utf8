            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Australian captain Ricky Ponting on Tuesday came out in support of Adam Gilchrist and said the former Aussie wicketkeeper meant no malice towards Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Ponting said that unnecessary controversy had been created over the former wicketkeepers remarks on Sachin Tendulkar in the monkeygate controversy during the India-Australia series Down Under.         
	Gilchrist, in his autobiography, True Colours, has criticised Tendulkars role during the Harbhajan Singh race-row trial, accusing him of giving different versions to the match referee and the ICC adjudicator.         
	I do not think there was any malice intended from Adam in what he had to say in his book, Ponting said at the end of the Australian practice session at the Kotla on Tuesday.         
	I think it was reading between the lines. He (Gilchrist) has actually contacted Sachin and cleared the air, Ponting said.

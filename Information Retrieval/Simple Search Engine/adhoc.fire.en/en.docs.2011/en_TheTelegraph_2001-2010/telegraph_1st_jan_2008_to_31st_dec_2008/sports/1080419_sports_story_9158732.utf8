The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | One of the happiest days of my life: Shah Rukh
                                                                                                                                                                                                       One of the happiest days of my life: Shah Rukh
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly (top) and owner Shah Rukh Khan celebrate the win in Bangalore on Friday                             
	Bangalore: Its one of the happiest days of my life and certainly the happiest on a sports field... I couldnt be happier, is what Shah Rukh Khan said soon after returning to the Windsor after the Kolkata Knight Riders stunning win at the Chinnaswamy.         
	So thrilled was Shah Rukh that he hit the dressing room floor and danced to the theme song  Korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re.         
	What a performance! I mean, look at the way (MoM) Brendon McCullum batted... An amazing innings... My boys were throwing themselves on the field and, well, its just very pleasing, Shah Rukh told The Telegraph.         
	The team returned to the hotel some 30 minutes after Shah Rukh got back and he was at hand to greet them once again.         
	Hugging captain Sourav Ganguly, Shah Rukh remarked: Hed told me he was a bit nervous returning to cricket as a captain, but he neednt have been... You know how Sourav leads...         
	As he headed towards his suite to freshen up for a party thrown by Bangalore Royal Challengers owner Vijay Mallya, Shah Rukh added: It does set things up very well for a Super Sunday at the Eden... Indeed, Im so happy for all our fans...         
	The Bollywood badshah, incidentally, had gone straight to the stadium after arriving on a private jet. Once at the Chinnaswamy, he had a one-on-one with each player and member of the support staff.         
	Sourav, meanwhile, remarked that hed never seen a better innings than McCullums unbeaten 158, the highest in any form of Twenty20.         
	Asked if he too wouldve chosen to field, like Rahul Dravid did, Sourav replied: No... In fact, I was quite surprised by Rahuls decision...         
	Footnote: Neither acknowledged it, but the match had also been a battle between Sourav and Dravid, whod replaced him as the Team India captain in October 2005. As it turned out, Sourav could do no wrong, while Dravid got nothing right on his home ground.

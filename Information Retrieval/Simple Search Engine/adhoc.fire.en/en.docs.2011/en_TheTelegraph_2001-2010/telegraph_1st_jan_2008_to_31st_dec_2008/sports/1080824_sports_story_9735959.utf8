            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Jagmohan Dalmiya                           
	Calcutta/Mumbai: Even as the BCCI working committee decided to ask Jagmohan Dalmiya to cough up over Rs 47 crore for alleged misappropriation of 1996 World Cup funds, Sharad Pawar took the CAB representative aside and told him that he held no personal grudge against the former president.         
	This happened after the meeting on Saturday when the current president spoke to CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey for around 10 minutes. Pawar told Dey that he held no personal grudge against Dalmiya and didnt want to sour the relationship with him. He also requested Dey to convey his message to Dalmiya.         
	The working committee also made it clear that CAB wouldnt be deprived of the BCCIs grants. The question, however, remains as to what has stopped Pawar from calling up Dalmiya to convey his feelings.         
	At the meeting, treasurer N. Srinivasan (who is tipped to be the next secretary) raised the issue and said that if the Rs 47 crore wasnt paid, the BCCI would drag the veteran administrator into a civil suit .         
	The police have filed a criminal case against him and we want the money to be recovered. Since we cant file the civil suit after February 2009, as it will become time-barred then, we want to hasten the process, sources said.

                                                Day I highlights
                      
	 The Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) is hosting its 96th Test match  second only to the Melbourne Cricket Ground (100 Tests) in terms of Australian grounds hosting Tests. SCG is also third highest in the world in terms of Tests hosted after Lords (114) and Melbourne (100). India are playing their 9th Test at the SCG.         
	 It was Phil Jaquess first duck of his career in 9th innings. He thus missed out on equalling the world record of scoring seven consecutive fifties.         
	 The last time an Australian opening partnership went for zero was five Tests ago in the second innings against England in Perth (2006-07). Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden were the openers.         
	 Harbhajan Singh has now dismissed Ricky Ponting seven times in Tests. Englands Darren Gough has dismissed Ponting the maximum of eight times, with Harbhajan and Kumble seven times each.         
	 Ricky Ponting has now been dismissed lbw 32 times in Test cricket. He equals Mark Waugh (32) as the Australians with most lbw dismissals. Englands Graham Gooch has been dismissed lbw the maximum of 50 times         
	 Sachin Tendulkar has now taken three catches in an innings for the fourth time in his career. The previous other instances where he took three catches in an innings are:         
	* vs NZ Bangalore (1995-95)         
	* vs WI, Bridgetown (1996-97)         
	* vs Pak, Karachi (2005-06)               
	 The Dravid-Kumble combination has now accounted for 52 dismissals in Tests. Eleven times the duo have combined to dismiss Australian batsmen. However against Australia, the most successful fielder-bowler combination is Dravid-Harbhajan (13 dismissals).         
	 Australias score of 376 for seven at the end of Day I has now equalled the fifth highest score, put up on the first day of a Test match on Australian soil. Australia had scored 376 for five vs Pakistan at Adelaide, 1983-84.         
	 The score of 376 for seven is however now the second best score on the first day at the Sydney Crcket Ground. The best remains 494 for six by Australia vs South Africa at Sydney 1910-1911.         
	 Andrew Symonds scored his second Test hundred. Both his Test centuries have come on Australian soil. The first being 156 vs England in Melbourne (2006-07).         
	 With Symondss century, SCG now has 150 Test hundreds. The MCG (166) holds the Australian record, while the Lords (197) has the all time record.               
	The seventh wicket partnership of 173 runs between Andrew Symonds and Brad Hogg erased the following records:         
	 On 51 they went past the previous highest of 50 between Allan Border and Merv Hughes for Australia vs India at the Sydney Cricket Ground         
	 On 109 they eclipsed the previous best against India. The earlier record (108) was by Steve Waugh and Shane Warne at Adelaide in 1999-00         
	 On 150 the duo put up the eighth 150-plus partnership by Australia in Tests.         
	 On 161 they beat the previous highest at the SCG. The previous record was 160 by Richie Benaud amp; G.D. McKenzie (Aus vs SA, 1963-64).               
	Brad Hogg during the course of his innings broke the following records:         
	On 37 he went past his previous best (35* vs India in Melbourne in the last Test.         
	This was his 27th first-class and first Test fifty.         
	However he missed out on becoming the highest run scorer at No. 8 in Tests vs India. That record still lies with Shane Warne (86, Adelaide 1999-00)           COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

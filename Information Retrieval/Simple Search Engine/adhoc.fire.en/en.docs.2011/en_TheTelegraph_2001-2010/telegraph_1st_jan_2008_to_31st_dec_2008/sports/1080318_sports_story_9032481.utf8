                                                   CAB chief to meet members tomorrow
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: CAB president Prasun Mukherjee has called a meeting with all association units to discuss the contentious ticket-sharing issue.         
	The president wants to meet the representatives of all the 121 units on Wednesday. Itd be an informal meeting where he will discuss how best the 17,000 tickets can be distributed, a CAB official said on Monday. As of now, there is no question of calling a special general meeting (SGM), he added.         
	The opposition within the CAB wants Mukherjee to convene another SGM and reveal the details of what went on between him and Shah Rukh Khans Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd over the issue.         
	He was empowered in the last months SGM to negotiate with the Kolkata Knight Riders franchise owner.         
	Though we havent received any invitation, we want to attend the meeting, a member of the opposition camp said.         
	The CAB president held informal talks with a few members, seeking suggestions from them over the muddle.         
	It has been learnt that all present and former cricketers and umpires will be presented a ticket each.         
	East unit is likely to get two Club House passes instead of four, which is usually the case when an international match is hosted at the Eden.

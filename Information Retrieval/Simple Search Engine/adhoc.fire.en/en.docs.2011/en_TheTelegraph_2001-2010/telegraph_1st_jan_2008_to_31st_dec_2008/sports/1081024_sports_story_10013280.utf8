	Belgrade: Barcelona put one foot in the Champions League last 16 with a 5-0 away drubbing of Basel on Wednesday which left them the only team with a 100 per cent record halfway through the group stage (as briefly reported in Thursdays Late City edition).         
	Chelsea also closed in on the knockout stage after a 77th minute John Terry header from a corner gave them a 1-0 home win over Roma and five-time winners Liverpool are in a good position too following a 1-1 draw at Atletico Madrid. That result left the two teams joint top in group D on seven points after Simao Sabrosa steered in a late equaliser to cancel out Robbie Keanes 14th-minute opener for Liverpool.         
	Roma were busy, worked hard to close down the midfield and looked to occasionally break but their final ball was too often loose and they failed to threaten Petr Cech in the entire 90 minutes.         
	Chelsea also struggled to reproduce their enterprising football of recent weeks and it looked ever-more likely that they would need a set-piece to break through.         
	Chelsea, last seasons finalists have seven points in group A, three more than Romanias CFR Cluj, who went down 0-1 at Bordeaux thanks to a 54th-minute own goal by Cadu. The French side and Roma have three each.         
	PSV Eindhoven chalked up their first points in the group with a 2-0 home win over Olympique Marseille, courtesy of a Danny Koevermans brace that left the 1993 European Cup winners rooted to the bottom with three defeats.         
	An Adriano header on the stroke of half-time handed Inter Milan a 1-0 home success against Anorthosis Famagusta, leaving them firmly in the driving seat in group B with seven points, ahead of the Cypriots who have four.         
	Inter coach Jose Mourinho praised his teams professional performance that fell short of the sparkling form they showed in Sundays 4-0 Italian league rout of Roma.         
	Werder Bremen registered their third straight draw in that group after a 2-2 stalemate at Panathinaikos thanks to Hugo Almeidas 83rd-minute equaliser. The draw gave the Greek side their first point.         
	Crisp one-touch football from Barcelona tore Basel apart as Lionel Messi, Sergi Busquets and Bojan Krkic gave the 2006 winners a 3-0 lead in the first 22 minutes itself.

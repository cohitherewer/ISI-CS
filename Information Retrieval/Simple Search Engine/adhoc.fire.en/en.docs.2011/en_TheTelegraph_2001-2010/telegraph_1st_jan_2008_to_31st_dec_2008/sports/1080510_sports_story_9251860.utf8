The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib Akhtars only demand is a bicycle
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shoaib Akhtars only demand is a bicycle
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shoaib Akhtar                           
	Calcutta: Strange as it may sound, the only material demand that Shoaib Akhtar has placed before the Kolkata Knight Riders is for a bicycle!         
	He wants to cycle around but, obviously, thats not possible, a member of the Knight Riders team management told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	Shoaib, who joined the Knight Riders on Monday night after dramatic developments back in Pakistan, is understood to have been insisting that his needs are small.         
	He believes that hes always misunderstood That he actually wants to do good, but gets caught up in one controversy or the other, the team management member said.         
	Like compatriot Salman Butt, Shoaib is itching to turn out in the Indian Premier League. Butt has, of course, played one match in the fortnight or so that hes been with the Knight Riders.         
	While Butt should play in Hyderabad on Sunday, theres no certainty that Shoaib will.         
	Indeed, he spent much of Friday evening with physio Andrew Leipus.         
	Shoaib wont be fielded till hes absolutely match-fit (Coach) John Buchanan doesnt compromise on anything, least of all something to do with fitness, the team management member pointed out.         
	Hes gelling well with the team and has been made to feel comfortable Its all a question of just how soon hell be fully fit, the team management member added.         
	Clearly, theres a distinct difference between being fit and being match-fit. After 11 years as an international cricketer, Shoaib cant be unaware of that.

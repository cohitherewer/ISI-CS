The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A great team effort: Srikkanth
                                                                                                                                                                                                     A great team effort: Srikkanth
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: Krishnamachari Srikkanth, chairman of the national selection committee, on Sunday lauded the Indian team for their superb show against world champions Australia and termed it as a great team effort.         
	I think it was a great team effort. Sourav Ganguly hit a brilliant century and got good support from (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and (Sachin) Tendulkar, the former India captain said.         
	In the second innings, (Virender) Sehwag and Gambhir gave a great start to us. In fact, Gambhir played very well in the first innings also.         
	The chief selector also had a special word of praise for the bowlers in the side.         
	Harbhajan (Singh) bowled with a lot of heart and Zaheer (Khan) and Ishant (Sharma) were outstanding. This team effort is what we have been looking for, he added.

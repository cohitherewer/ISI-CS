The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj is the danger man: Stuart Broad
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yuvraj is the danger man: Stuart Broad
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: England seamer Stuart Broad admitted that England were always relieved to see the back of Yuvraj Singh as early as possible.         
	Talking to the reporters at the end of Day Four of the second Test here, Broad, who was famously despatched for six sixes in an over by Yuvraj in the Twenty20 World Cup, said: He (Yuvraj) is the danger man, coming at number six. He had a good couple of series against us and its always good to see the back of him early.         
	The England bowler, however, was not ready to read much into Pietersens statement that Yuvraj was a pie-chucker.         
	I heard it only last night. Both are great competitors and played the game in the right spirit. There was to be a battle at some stage but none crossed the line, Broad said laughingly.         
	Asked how he stopped the drive from Sehwag that finally resulted in Ian Bell picking up the ball to run out the Indian opener in spectacular fashion, Broad said he was only trying to stop the boundary.         
	I was just trying to stop a four and had my back to the stumps. Sehwag struggled to make ground and there was this great athleticism from Bell. It was great to see him doing what Jonty Rhodes used to do years ago, he said.

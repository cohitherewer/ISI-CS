The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DareDevils to bank on home advantage
                                                                                                                                                                                                     DareDevils to bank on home advantage
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	New Delhi: Cricket fans in Delhi will be treated with a heady cocktail of cricket and entertainment under the newly installed floodlights at the Feroz Shah Kotla on Saturday when Delhi DareDevils clash with Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Delhi DareDevils, led by local star Virender Sehwag, boasts of names like Glenn McGrath and Daniel Vettori. At the other end, will be spin legend Shane Warne marshalling Rajasthan Royals.         
	Apart from cricket, Delhiites will be treated to some breathtaking stunts by Akshay Kumar. Well known for his on screen daredevil acts, the top actor will be present at the Kotla to cheer the hosts.         
	 Both Sehwag and Warne skipped the Friday practice. They are presently in Bangalore to attend the inauguration ceremony of the IPL and expected to back in the capital on Saturday morning.         
	Both the teams will be heavily dependent on their local players as their foreign recruits are not available due to their commitments back home.         
	While Rajasthan Royals will miss Graeme Smith, Younis Khan, Kamran Akmal, Sohail Tanveer and Morne Morkel, the hosts will be without Shoaib Malik, Mohammed Asif and A.B. de Villiers.         
	We will be playing only three foreigners tomorrow (Saturday), said Mohammed Kaif of Rajasthan Royals. Warne, (Shane) Watson and (Darren) Lehman will be in our side.         
	The Jaipur side may not have stars in their ranks but it has youngsters like Ravindra Jadeja, Pankaj Singh and Turuwar Kohli, who are capable of delivering the goods at the right time.         
	To call us underdogs will be wrong, said Kaif.         
	 In Twenty20 cricket, any team can win. Our team is a mixture of youth and experience and perfectly capable of beating any side.         
	DareDevils have an explosive opening pair in skipper Sehwag and in-form Gautam Gambhir. While Sehwag is on a high after his triple century in the Chennai Test against South Africa, Gambhir is fresh from his two centuries in Australia.         
	The DareDevils attack will have the accuracy of McGrath and the guile of New Zealand skipper Vettori.Though this is our home ground, we are not taking our opponents lightly, said Gambhir. Its a small version of the game and anything can happen. But our team is getting along well and I think we can win the tournament.

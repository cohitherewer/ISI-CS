The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Massa leads Ferrari 1-2
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Massa leads Ferrari 1-2
                      
	Manama: Brazilian Felipe Massa led a Ferrari one-two at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday with teammate Kimi Raikkonen seizing the championship lead from McLarens Lewis Hamilton.         
	Giancarlo Fisichella outpaced Hamilton to finish an impressive 12th as Force India notched up their first double finish of the season.         
	Teammate Sutil, however, was involved in an opening lap mess and had to pit his car early with a broken nose. The German would still be happy with his 19th place, especially after failing to finish in Melbourne and Sepang.         
	Massas sixth career win brought him his first points of the Formula One season and came at the same Sakhir desert circuit where he fired up his title challenge last year with a pole-to-flag victory.         
	World champion Raikkonen collected the 50th podium finish of his Grand Prix career and the Finnish Iceman took over at the top with 19 points, three clear of BMW Saubers German Nick Heidfeld, after three races.         
	Hamilton, McLaren teammate Heikki Kovalainen and Polands Robert Kubica are level on 14.         
	Hamilton endured a nightmare afternoon, being lapped by the Ferraris after making an agonisingly slow start and then running into the back of former teammate Fernando Alonsos Renault. The Spaniard finished 10th.         
	McLaren were also leapfrogged at the top of the constructors standings by BMW Sauber.         
	Kubica finished third, after becoming the first BMW Sauber driver to start a Grand Prix from pole position, with Heidfeld fourth.         
	BMW Sauber have now finished on the podium in all of the first three races of the season, a feat unmatched by Ferrari or McLaren. They have 30 points to Ferraris 29 and McLarens 28.         
	Kovalainen was fifth, ahead of Toyotas Italian Jarno Trulli and Australian Mark Webber in a Red Bull. Germanys Nico Rosberg took the final point for Williams.         
	Massa made a faster getaway than Kubica while Hamilton was engulfed by the field, and took the chequered flag 3.3 seconds ahead of Raikkonen.         
	The race was really difficult at the beginning, there was a lot of oil on the track, said the Brazilian. Then during the race the car was just very good and I didnt push to the limit.         
	I had a not very easy few weeks, but thats life, he added in a reference to the pressure on him after retiring in Australia and Malaysia. Its not the first time and it wont be the last. I had two bad days in the first two races but I always knew that we were quick.         
	I wanted to win but weve been a bit off the pace all weekend, said Raikkonen. But Im leading the championship so if we can score second places on the bad weekends, Im not too disappointed.         
	Kubica said he had been hampered by a wheel spin at the start and then struggled with the oil on the track, with Raikkonen barging past on lap two.         
	Its very good to be on the podium for the second race in a row but without the problems on the second lap, I might have been able to fight with Kimi, said the Pole.

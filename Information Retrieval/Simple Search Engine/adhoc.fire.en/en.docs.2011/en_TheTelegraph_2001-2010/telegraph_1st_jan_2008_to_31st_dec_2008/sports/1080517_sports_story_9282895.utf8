The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United sweat on verdict
                                                                                                                                                                                                       United sweat on verdict
  - CRISTIANO RONALDO MULLS MOVE TO REAL MADRID       Oliver Kay               Cristiano Ronaldo                                 
	Cristiano Ronaldo cast a shadow over the Manchester Uniteds Champions League final preparations on Thursday by flirting with Real Madrid and declaring that he will make a decision on his future after the final showdown with Chelsea next Wednesday.         
	In an interview with a Madrid-based television station, Ronaldo, who picked up the Football Writers Association Footballer of the Year award in London on Thursday night, made clear that he still harbours the ambition to play in Spain and more for United. He also suggested that he would resolve where to ply his trade after the match in Moscow.         
	United however, maintained that there is no decision for Ronaldo to make, given that he has four years remaining on a five-year contract worth pounds 120,000 a week. David Gill, the chief executive of the club, recently announced that Ronaldo is not for sale at any price and that it would make quot;no sense quot; to sell him, even for a world-record fee in excess of pounds 50 million. But Old Trafford officials were dismayed to learn of the 23-year-olds comments on thursday at a press meet that was held to preview the Champions League final.         
	In interviews with Uniteds official media outlets, the Portuguese winger has continually stated his long-term commitment to the Barclays Premier League champions, but his comments to the Spanish media have been markedly different.         
	He said on several occasions on thursday that he was happy at Old Trafford, the overriding message was that he may be even happier in Spain - music to the ears of his persistent suitors in Madrid. Questioned about his future by Spanish television journalists, Ronaldo said: I am happy here, but lets see what happens after the Champions League final. I am feeling calm here. Im happy here, but in the future I dont know.         
	Asked whether he specifically meant moving to Spain, the Portuguese replied: I have said many times that I would love to play in Spain, but its one thing to dream and another thing for it to be in reality. I dont know about Real Madrid, the club, but I know that they like my game. I know that other teams in Spain also like me. Its good to know that they appreciate my game, but I am happy here.         
	The ambience in Madrid for much of this season, even from Ramon Calderon, the ebullient and highly ambitious president , has been that Project Ronaldo was on hold until at least 2009, but they appear to have been given some encouragement in recent weeks, perhaps by the players agent, Jorge Mendes, or those very close to him. It cannot have gone unnoticed in Madrid that recent gossip columns have linked Ronaldo heavily with Nereida Gallardo, a model based in Spain.         
	Manchester have been mystified by the number of reports in recent months suggesting that Ronaldo is in talks over a new contract that would increase his wages to 150,000 pounds a week. They have been so irked by them that last month they took an unusual step of issuing a statement to say that, having agreed that contract barely 12 months earlier, no such negotiations were taking place or even planned.         
	A source close to Ronaldo, though, maintains that the forward will pursue another new contract at the end of the season and that his future will be dictated by Manchester Uniteds willingness or otherwise to accommodate his increased demands.         
	One player who has seemingly committed the remaining of his career to United is Rio Ferdinand, who signed a new five-year contract on thursday, having agreed terms on a deal, worth in excess of pounds 100,000 a week, four weeks ago.         
	Earlier in his career, the England defender had spoken of his desire to play in Italy and Spain, but this new contract in theory binds him to United until June 2013, by which time he will be almost 35, and strengthens his claim to be the clubs next captain.         
	Manchester United is a fantastic club and I am delighted I have signed a new contract, the 29-year-old player, said in a statement.         
	It is a great honour to be a part of this trophy-winning team and to share the success which I am sure will continue for several seasons to come.           THE TIMES, LONDON

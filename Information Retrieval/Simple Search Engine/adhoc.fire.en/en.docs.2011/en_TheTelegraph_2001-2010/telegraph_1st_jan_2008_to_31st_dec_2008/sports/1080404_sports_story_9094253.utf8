The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India had no game plan, says Steyn
                                                     India had no game plan, says Steyn
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Dale Steyn after taking one of his five wickets on Thursday. (AFP)                           
	Ahmedabad: Dale Steyn is relishing his love affair with the subcontinent. The South African speedster followed up his fivers against Pakistan and Bangladesh with another one (five for 23) at the Motera on Thursday, playing a key role in dismissing India for a paltry 76 within 20 overs. Adding salt to the home teams wounds, Steyn said after the Day I action that Anil Kumble and Co. lacked a proper game plan.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Nature of the wicket         
	I was a bit surprised to see the grass on the pitch It looked like probably a Day I pitch in South Africa. It helped us because we are accustomed to bowl on this kind of wicket back home.         
	Indias capitulation         
	They probably didnt have a strategy. They were bowled out for 76 and I guess thats what happens when you dont have a game plan. Thats the vibe theyve given off. Once they lost the first couple of wickets, things went wrong for them. It looked like the guys who came in next didnt really know how to approach it and how to play the game.         
	The most satisfying wicket         
	Of the five (Rahul) Dravids wicket was a pretty decent one. That was probably the best ball of the day. Hopefully I can deliver a few more of those in the second innings.         
	His performance in the subcontinent         
	Im enjoying bowling in the subcontinent Todays performance is probably the best so far.         
	Strategy on Friday         
	Maybe we can play with a bit of freedom and increase the lead to quite a big total. Then the pressure will be all on them. They have to do something. You cant go into the last Test losing this game.         
	Plan against Virender Sehwag         
	We had something for Sehwag. Bowling short is one thing, but its that follow-up ball that always gets you a wicket. None of the Indians came on to the frontfoot and it helped our cause.

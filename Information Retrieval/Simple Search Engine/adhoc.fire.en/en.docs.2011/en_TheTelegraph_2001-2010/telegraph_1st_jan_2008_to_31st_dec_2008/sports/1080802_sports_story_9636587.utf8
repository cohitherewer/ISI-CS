                                                                                                                                                                                                       Parveen brace in EB win
  - Red-and-golds placed second with 11 points while Peerless have only one in kitty       A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta: Parveen Kumar struck a brace to boost East Bengal to a 3-1 win against Peerless SC in their sixth-round match in the Premier Division of the Sahara Calcutta Football League at the Howrah Stadium on Friday.         
	Ashim Biswas opened the scoring for the red and golds, on a day when they looked quite disciplined on a sluggish pitch. The outfield was in such a sorry state that it could have dealt a severe blow to East Bengals plans before Tuesdays derby against arch rivals Mohun Bagan.         
	A listless Peerless SC reduced the margin via an Emmanuel Junior header in the 45th minute.         
	Starting on an aggressive note, East Bengal, with players mostly from their reserve bench, empowered their opponent in all departments.         
	Both Ashim and Man-of-the-Match Parveens tricky moves fooled Peerless defenders from the onset.         
	The East Bengal attacking duo showed excellent understanding upfront with able support from Jayanta Sen, Dipankar Roy, Khangebam Singh and Malsawmkima.         
	Faced with continuing forays, Peerless, led by Madhab Das in defence, were simply clueless. Despite having two foreigners Junior and James Agbo  in their ranks, Peerless presented a defensive game plan.         
	While the lanky Junior showed some good moves, a dismal midfield and defence let them down.         
	After missing out an easy chance on the eight minute, Ashim, in the 21st minute, finally netted in a brilliant left-footer. Cashing in on a Poibiang Poshna throw, Ashim unleashed a 25-yard shot to put East Bengal in the lead.         
	Six minutes later, Parveen, grabbing a cheeky through ball from Anupam Sarkar from the left, strolled inside the Peerless box to roll it past custodian Amar Deb to score the second goal. Peerlesss allegation that it was an off-side move, was turned down by the referee Debasis Mishra.         
	East Bengal continued their dominating football in the second half. While Saheb Ali Mondal replaced M. Suresh, Nirmal Chhetri came in for Dipankar Roy. Saikat Saha Roy substituted Malsawmkima.         
	In the 66th minute, Parveen scored his second goal from an Ashim Biswas through.         
	East Bengal, after Fridays match, are second on the table having 11 points, while Peerless have managed only one point from the same number of outings.

	Galle rsquo;s race against time  Galle: Workers are racing against time to spruce up the tsunami-hit Galle Cricket Stadium for the second India-Sri Lanka Test starting on July 31.
  The picturesque stadium is located amid the meandering roads that head for the Galle Fort and people can even view the match atop the old European style fort. The seemingly small boundaries of the ground will tempt players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Kumar Sangakkara to have a go at the bowlers. It is after a long time that hotels here are reporting heavy bookings due to the Test match after the protracted ethnic war and tsunami left the city with few tourists.  
	Srinivasan stays  Calcutta: The ruling group, headed by president N. Srinivasan, won all the posts at the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association elections on Sunday, says A Staff Reporter. Srinivasan defeated former BCCI president A.C. Muthiah 134-55. Two votes were declared invalid out of a total of 191. The treasurer rsquo;s post went to S Ganesan. Kasi Viswanathan, the sitting secretary, polled the maximum 142 votes. He beat Shanti Kumbhat, who bagged 49 votes. G. Natarajan retained thw joint secretary rsquo;s post, defeating K. Balaji 120-71.  
	ZC peeved  London: Faced with the threat of expulsion from the ICC, Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) on Sunday questioned the logic behind such a possibility especially when the African nation continues to play other sports at the international level without any restriction.
  Just before the ICC rsquo;s annual conference in Dubai, England had announced cancelling their home series against Zimbabwe, days after South Africa had severed ties with the trouble-torn nation. ZC managing director Ozias Bvute questioned both the decisions and said he had no idea why cricket authorities were reacting in such a way while governing bodies of other sports had no problem with Zimbabwe.  
	SLC debt free  Colombo: India rsquo;s next month tour to Sri Lanka has come as a boon for the cash-starved board here, which has cleared a huge debt after selling TV rights of the bilateral series. According to Sri Lanka Cricket officials, the board paid off huge bank commitments after getting advance payments for selling TV rights of the forthcoming series.

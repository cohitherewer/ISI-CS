                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mohinder: No clear favourites
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohinder Amarnath, the former India allrounder and currently the consultant for the Bengal Ranji Trophy squad, said on Saturday that the India-Australia series is going to be a competitive one, as it has always been when the two sides meet.         
	He quipped: Over the years the India-Australia series has always been very competitive. Theres no clear favourite, with both teams giving their best shot till the end. So it will be difficult to say whether India or Australia are the favourites. The team that will take the lead will have an advantage.         
	When asked whether the euphoria surrounding any India versus Pakistan series is now fading in comparison to the hype generated when India take on Australia, Amarnath said: You cant compare. Every series has its own charm.         
	With the entire nation keeping a close watch on the performances of the Big Four of Indian cricket, Amarnath said that there will be no extra pressure on the senior pros.

            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: A total of 77 players, both Indian and foreigners, will go under the hammer in Mumbai on Wednesday in an important phase of the DLF Indian Premier League (IPL). The League on Tuesday issued a set of uniform guidelines to all eight franchisees, laying bare the rules and guidelines.         
	Richard Madley, an independent professional auctioneer, will conduct the private auction. He will also be the sole arbiter, according to information received here. IPL commissioner Lalit Modi said: The IPL governing council is pulling out all stops to ensure a free, transparent and fair bidding process.         
	Format         
	The auction will be open with each player being individually put up for bidding by the franchisees. The highest bid accepted by the auctioneer shall be the buyer at that price. There are around 78 players in the auction. Each cricketer has an annual base fee at which the bidding for that individual starts. This fee assumes that the player is available for the entire IPL season, including, if applicable, the Champions Tournament. The fee will be adjusted on a pro-rata basis depending on the players availability for the season in the first year.         
	Each franchisee has a cap of up to $5 million that it can spend on the auction for the 2008 season. Players under the hammer will be arranged into sets of approximately 12 according to their base fee, skill and expected availability for the 2008 season.         
	If a player, who on the day of the auction is expected to be unavailable for the 2008 season, subsequently becomes available (through retirement, non-selection or tour cancellation), he could become part of the relevant franchisees squad for that season. Provided of course that he obtains a NOC from his home board.         
	Bidding         
	Within the sets, the order auction will be determined by a random draw. Each player will be the subject of an open auction with the auctioneer controlling the process. Bidders will raise a paddle to indicate a bid (only one official bidder per franchisee). Each bid will represent the player fee per season to be paid by the franchisee to the player for each of the seasons 2008, 2009 and 2010, ignoring any periods of unavailability. Once made, no bid may be withdrawn.         
	Increments         
	 Bids up to $100,000  increments of $5,000         
	 Bids from $100,000 to $250,000  increments of $10,000         
	 Bids from $250,000 to $500,000  increments of $25,000         
	 Bids in excess of $500,000  increments at the auctioneers discretion         
	As each player is sold, the franchisee will be required to sign a form confirming the terms of the agreement (name of player, player fee). The player fee will be deemed to include any fee that may be payable to the players agent.         
	Following the conclusion of each set, there will be a break to allow franchisees time to re-evaluate their tactics. Players for whom no bids are received when they are initially presented for auction will be placed in a final set and will be re-presented once all of the initial sets have been concluded. Franchises may not buy foreign players in advance of the auction (whether such players are among the list to be auctioned or otherwise).         
	After the auction, franchises are free to purchase additional foreign players subject to their informing the BCCI/IPL of any such move.         
	The BCCI/IPL will approach the players on their behalf to negotiate the contracted fee up to an amount set by the franchisee, and will endeavour to obtain a NOC from that players home board.         
	If more than one franchisee is interested in a particular player, the IPL may hold a further auction.         
	The fees paid to any additional foreign player for 2008 must not exceed the maximum purse of $5 million. Indian players who are not in the auction can be signed at any time.         
	The player fees of any icon players  being 115 per cent of the highest player fee in that franchisees squad  will count towards the maximum purse of $5 million.         
	The contract will be for a fixed term of three years.

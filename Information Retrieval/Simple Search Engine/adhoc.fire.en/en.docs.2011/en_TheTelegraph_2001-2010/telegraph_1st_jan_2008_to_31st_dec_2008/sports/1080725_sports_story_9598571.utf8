	Calcutta: Aditya Khaitan of Williamson Magor A put in an impressive third round of 69 to take his team to a strong score of 222 in the Tata Steel presented The Telegraph Cup in association with Ballantines.         
	McLeod amp; Co. are the closest opposition with their star player Ishan Bajoria returning a 77 for a three-day total of 239. Tata Steel A, the defending champions, saw their managing director B. Muthuraman put in a creditable performance but with only one round to go they have a lot of ground to make up.         
	Division II is slightly more competitive with three teams in the fray  Williamson Magor D, Tinplate A and Eveready. Division III has a runaway winner in Naresh Kumar amp; Co. for whom SK Anand returned a 78.         
	In The Telegraph Challenge Cup, the field is still wide open though Orson Holdings are odds on favourite with their total of 113 stableford points and they are closely being tracked by DG Associates, MPY Logistics, Merino Industries and Mayur Offset.

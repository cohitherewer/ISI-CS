	Monza: McLarens attempt to reinstate Lewis Hamilton as Belgian Grand Prix winner will be heard by Formula Ones court of appeal in Paris on September 22, the governing FIA said on Friday.         
	Championship leader Hamilton was stripped of the victory after race stewards at Spa ruled he had gained an advantage from cutting a chicane while challenging Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen.         
	Hamilton was one of six drivers who did not attempt to complete a timed lap.

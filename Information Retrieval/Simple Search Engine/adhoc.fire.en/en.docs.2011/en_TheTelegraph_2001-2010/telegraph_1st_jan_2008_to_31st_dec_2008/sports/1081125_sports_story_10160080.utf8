            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: United SC will have two foreigners at their disposal when they face Vasco SC in their Round X ONGC I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday.         
	While both Ayeni Bidemi Daniel and Subair Murithala Ali are fit to don the jersey, the other Nigerian Louis Nigi Ebami is likely to sit out on a day when the city team face the Goan club in a do-or-die encounter.         
	United SC Coach Subrata Bhattacharjee however, appeared sounded a bit sceptical about the refereeing.         
	I am worried about the refereeing. We have to win the match but most things depend on the referees. They are not at all a bad side.         
	We need to be cautious and use the home advantage, Bhattacharjee said.         
	United SC are placed tenth with nine points from equal number of matches while Vasco SC are bottom of the league table with two points from nine encounters.

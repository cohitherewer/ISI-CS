	Perth: Gary Kirsten, who takes over as Team India coach from March 1, has prepared a document to counter the fast and bouncy Waca track where the conditions will be mentally more demanding for the batsmen. 
    
	There is definitely a difference in playing on hard and bouncy wickets as in Perth. It takes a lot of courage to get into the right positions. More than technical, its a mental adjustment and certainly in the next two days I will work with the players Its an area we have to look upon, said Kirsten in his first press conference in India colours. 
    
	The former South Africa opener felt that more than any other nation, Australia tests the true character of a cricketer. 
    
	Its a mental battle and when you come to Australia since they leave no stone unturned. And one reason why I love Test cricket is that it tests who you are as a person. 
    
	I think you can survive with a certain level of skill if you have the character and determination. Certainly, when you play Australia in Australia you are awfully examined as a person. 
    
	Kirsten said there are no easy games in Perth. 
    
	Its a very tough environment because the Australians are highly competitive as a team and you never have an easy game out here. 
    
	For the boys, whatever the situation you are in on this tour, its going to be mentally demanding. 
    
	The Australians always argue that this is the best place to bat on. They get very excited about that and one needs to break the challenge in that fashion. When you play here in a Test, you are not coming here to lose the match. You give it everything youve got. 
    
	What is needed, said Kirsten, is a lot of courage and determination. 
    
	We have to play with a lot of courage and determination. Certainly I have seen that in this Indian team They want to get over last weeks controversy. They are ready to get out there and play cricket Its going to require a couple of guys to step up to the plate and show that they are ready for this very big battle. 
    
	But the Team India coach-designate felt its important to look at it as half-full, not a half-empty glass. 
    
	You can take it as a half-full or half-empty glass. As a batsman, you have a lot of opportunity so its a question of how each individual is going to take it. 
    
	Its been a tough week. Two cricket mad countries, lots of emotions lots of intensity I am quite sad to see how things have gone in the last week and obviously look forward to everyone give it back to cricket. 
    
	But Kirsten declined to say anything on team selection. 
    
	I have just arrived. We will talk about this later. Two spinners are unlikely at Waca but Harbhajan is one of the strengths of this Indian team and we may just look to play him. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant find of the series: Kumble
                                                  Ishant find of the series: Kumble
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ishant Sharma                           
	Adelaide: Anil Kumble didnt win any award during the four-Test series which ended on Monday, but for many, the Team India captain was actually the MoS  on and off the field.         
	Twenty wickets and an average of just under 30 with the bat. Add to that excellent leadership and theres a winner in front of you.         
	Kumble will be heading home as the defeated captain, but he can travel with head held high.         
	Typically, he didnt speak of what he did on Australian soil, but praised his team. Im proud... is something one heard more than once during a Q amp;A session.         
	Later, talking to The Telegraph at the Hyatt, Kumble said: If youre speaking of one player then, yes, Ishant Sharma is the find of the series... In my view, though, the entire team fought well throughout         
	Its not really significant that the lanky Ishant had already played a couple of Tests (both in 2007) before arriving in Australia.         
	By the way, hes been retained for the tri-series.         
	If Kumble has a regret  and a big one  its that the tail couldnt bat for another seven-eight minutes at the SCG. Had it been done, the result wouldnt have been 2-1 in Australias favour.         
	Counterpart Ricky Ponting tried to be smart and suggested that some of the Team India seniors would surely retire by next season, before his team landed in India for another four-Test series.         
	Kumble (who is himself 37), however, wasnt impressed. Theres still time for that, he responded somewhat caustically.         
	Then, when someone asked whether his team had brought the Australians arrogance down a couple of notches, Kumble replied: No... We raised our game and again showed just how well we compete against the best...         
	Despite the series loss, were now second in the International Cricket Councils standings. Even a defeat, then, can have a silver lining of sorts.

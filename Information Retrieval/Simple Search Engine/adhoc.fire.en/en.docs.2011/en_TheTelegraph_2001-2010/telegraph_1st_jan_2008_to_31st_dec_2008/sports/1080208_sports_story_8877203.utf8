The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No use sledging Sachin: Warne
                                                  No use sledging Sachin: Warne
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sachin Tendulkar                           
	Calcutta: Shane Warne sees nothing wrong with sledging in cricket except that he feels its futile using that tactic against batsmen of the calibre of Sachin Tendulkar or Brian Lara whom a bowler should rather befriend.         
	I do believe that sledging is a legitimate weapon as long as it does not become abusive. Foul language or an aggressive tone are signs of a frustrated player, the retired spin legend wrote in his column for The Times, London.         
	Warne said he found it an effective weapon against lesser batsmen.         
	I found it an extremely effective tactic against an insecure batsman who could be intimidated. South Africas Darryl Cullinan springs to mind as a good player who was not confident against Australia, particularly leg-spin.         
	But when it comes to Sachin or Lara, bowlers should not make that mistake, he felt.         
	With Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara, its better to be friends and make them smile rather than wind them up.         
	The sledging issue has become topical again after the Harbhajan Singh appeal  even being described as un-Australian by Michael Jeffery, the Governor-General.         
	Allan Border, who was captain when I made my Test debut in 1992, showed me how sledging can be used in a different way.         
	Sometimes I would fire myself up at the end of an over, for example, by saying to a batsman: What are you looking at? He would usually reply: What are you talking about? Suddenly, there was a contest  nothing nasty, just full-on cricket. I do not see any harm in that, Warne wrote.         
	The master leg-spinner was happy that Sachin could mark his last Test in Australia with a hundred in Adelaide.         
	Sachin batted brilliantly for his hundred in Adelaide. I am pleased that he marked his last Test in Australia that way. I spoke to him before the game and we reminisced about going to see Sir Donald Bradman together many years ago. Sachin has been a great ambassador and he deserved to leave on a strong personal note.         
	Warne, a member of the BCCI-backed Indian Premier League (IPL), also voiced his support for the rival Indian Cricket League (ICL), saying its ridiculous and short-sighted that players like Shane Bond should be banned for taking part in ICL.         
	I think of the IPL and ICL together in promoting and expanding the game.         
	With that in mind, it is ridiculous that Shane Bond should be banned for taking part in the ICL. It just strikes me as short-sighted that one of the most exciting bowlers in the world is no longer allowed to play for New Zealand. He is one of their best players.         
	Warne, worlds second highest-Test wicket taker, felt Australia would inevitable weaken after the retirement of so many iconic players but it is a marvellous achievement for them to have beaten Sri Lanka and India at home.

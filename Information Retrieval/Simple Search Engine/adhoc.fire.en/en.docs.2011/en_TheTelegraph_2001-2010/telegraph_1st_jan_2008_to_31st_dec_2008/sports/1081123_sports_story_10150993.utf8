The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sri Lanka steamroll Zimbabwe
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sri Lanka steamroll Zimbabwe
                      
	Harare: Two days after a senior ICC delegation turned up to assess Zimbabwes suitability for a return to Test cricket the countrys batsmen ruined everything by cobbling together only 67 runs in 31 overs against Sri Lanka here Saturday.         
	Their dismal nine wicket defeat followed one that was barely better on Thursday in the first of the five match ODI series when Zimbabwe struggled to reach 124.         
	They have thus made fewer than 200 runs in two innings while the tourists have required only five completed individual innings, leaving some batsmen short of batting practice and with others getting none at all.         
	Home skipper Prosper Utseya won the toss and decided to bat, defying the accepted tradition at Harare Sports Club in taking the field. It was a bad move.

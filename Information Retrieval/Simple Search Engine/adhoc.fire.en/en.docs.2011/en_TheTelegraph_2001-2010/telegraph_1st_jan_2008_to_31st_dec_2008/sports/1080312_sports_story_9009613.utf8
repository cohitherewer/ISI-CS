                                                       Sons come out of fathers shadows
                  Nelson Piquet Jr (above) and Kazuki Nakajima                           
	Paris: Nelson Piquet Junior and Kazuki Nakajima will join the select Formula One fathers and sons club in 2008 under pressure to live up to some weighty expectations.         
	On the grid, theyll find two-year veteran Nico Rosberg who, like them, is a boy wonder determined to carve out his own reputation in the most unforgiving and dangerous of sports.         
	Piquet Junior has the largest legacy to live up to.         
	Not only did his father capture three world titles in 1981, 1983 and 1987, the 22-year-old Brazilian starts his debut season as teammate to double world champion Fernando Alonso at Renault.         
	Piquet insists that having a racing pedigree isnt necessarily an advantage.         
	By the time you get to Formula One, I dont think its reputation that counts, said the Brazilian.         
	If you have made it this far, then its because you have talent and the potential to do the job. I think that is what people within the team judge you on, not a name or a reputation. They know the times, they can see the work you do, and that is what decides whether you fail or succeed.         
	A famous name may create attention in the outside world, but I am my own person and determined to succeed on my own merits, not thanks to my fathers achievements.         
	Piquet has the advantage of knowing that his famous father will not be present at the season opener in Melbourne on Sunday as hell be on a business trip.         
	Meanwhile, Rosberg, whose father Keke was world champion in 1982, is entering his third season with Williams.         
	His teammate will be Nakajima, the son of Satoru Nakajima, who raced in almost 80 Grands Prix from 1987-1991 and was on of the first Japanese drivers to hold down a regular place in the world championship.         
	Rosberg, ninth in the 2007 series, will not have to go far if he needs the advice of his 60-year-old father who will attend every race as a commentator for German TV.         
	But Keke admitted that hes unable to offer an insight into whether or not his sons team will mount a sustained challenge to Ferrari and McLaren.         
	I dont know how good the Williams is. When I talk to Nico, we talk about other things. He tells me nothing, even when I push him, sighed Rosberg Senior.         
	Nakajima featured in the last race of the 2007 season at Interlagos having replaced Alexander Wurz at Williams.         
	It was a memorable occasion for the 23-year-old from Aichi who finished 10th after starting in 19th place despite having run over members of his pit crew during an over-enthusiastic pit stop.         
	He has already had to fight off allegations that his drive was secured due to Williams partnership with Japanese engine suppliers Toyota.         
	I believe the drive has come from my performances, said Naajima.         
	Formula One has seen some examples of sons thriving despite their fathers achievements.         
	Damon Hill won one world title to almost match father Grahams two while Jacques Villeneuve was also a world champion, something that his dashing and tragic father Gilles never accomplished. However, other sons have failed dismally.         
	Emerson Fittipaldi celebrated two world titles while son Christian, struggling in unlamented Minardi and footwork cars, never managed as much as one step on the podium in his three-year career.         
	Mario Andretti was a world champion but son Michael endured a miserable season with McLaren.         
	Triple world champion Jack Abraham too was unable to pass on his magic to son David who struggled at the back of the field in a Simtek and quit Formula One in 1994 after the death of teammate Roland Ratzenberger at Imola.

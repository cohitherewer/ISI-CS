	Calcutta: Sayantan Das, who won golds (Under-12) in the recently concluded World Youth Chess Championship in Vung Tau, Vietnam, feels the turning point in his career came when he finished second in The Telegraph Schools meet this year.         
	I had been participating in The Telegraph Schools meet for the past two years but didnt achieve any significant success. This time I was determined to win the title. I tried hard but lost to eventual champion Girish Kaushik.         
	But the exposure and experience gained from the tournament came in very handy. It went a long way in my achieving success in Vietnam. I would say I was well prepared and so wasnt surprised by this success, Sayantan, who returned to the city on Sunday, said exclusively.         
	Sayantan, who won gold in the individual and team events in the World Youth Championship, was felicitated by the Alekhine Chess Club at Gorky Sadan along with Diptayan Ghosh, who won bronze in the team event (Under-10). Sayantan was presented with a cheque of Rs 50,000.         
	Sayantan bagged 9.5 out of 11 in the tournament, losing to Yang Darwin of the US before being held to a draw by Dmitri Gordiesky of Russia.         
	The first player from Bengal to win a gold medal at any world chess championship, Sayantan worked closely with Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda (another product of The Telegraph Schools meet) while preparing for the meet. Understandably, Sandipan has been overwhelmed by Sayantans success.         
	At their age I never dreamt of winning a world title. He has proved that success is achievable despite the constraints He has a very bright future, said the Grandmaster.         
	Sayantan, a class VII student of Scottish Church School, took to chess at the age of seven. The concentration, patience and the mental aspect attracted me to the sport, said Sayantan. His father Supravas gave up his job to devote time to his son while mother Panchali works in a hospital.         
	Coughing up enough money for participating in various tournaments is the biggest hurdle. Hopefully things will somewhat improve now, said his father.         
	A die-hard fan of world champion Viswanathan Anand, Sayantan followed every move and game, barring the final one, of the world championship in Bonn. My game clashed with Anands final game in Bonn. So I was forced to miss it I learnt a lot, especially how to improve ones position in the middle game, he said.

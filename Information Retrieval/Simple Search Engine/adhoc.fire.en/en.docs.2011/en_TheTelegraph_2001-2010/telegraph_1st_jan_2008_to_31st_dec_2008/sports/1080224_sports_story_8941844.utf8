                                                   Australians advised to be cautious
  - Metros may be the target of terrorist attacks, says foreign ministry                                   Andrew Symonds is the highest bid Aussie cricketer in the Indian Premier League        
	Melbourne: In what could turn out to be a huge dampener for the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL), Australias foreign ministry has warned its cricketers of the high risk of terrorist activities in India.         
	Australian cricketers, including Andrew Symonds and Matthew Hayden, have been reluctant to tour Pakistan in March-April after the department of foreign affairs and trade (DFAT) warned of the volatile situation there after the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.         
	Now the DFAT has also advised the cricketers about the adverse security conditions in India too, according to a local daily.         
	This may jeopardise the participation of Australian cricketers in the multi-million dollar IPL starting on April 18.         
	The DFAT report for Pakistan said: We strongly advise you to reconsider your need to travel to Pakistan at this time due to the very high threat of terrorist attack, sectarian violence and the unpredictable security situation.         
	We continue to receive a stream of credible reports indicating that terrorists are in the advanced stages of planning attacks. They could target Western or Australian interests and individuals and places frequented by foreigners.         
	It said credible information indicated consulates and hotels could be targeted in Karachi and Islamabad and they could occur at any time.         
	The DFAT advice for India warned: We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution in India because of the high risk of terrorist activities by militant groups. Recent credible information indicates that Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta may be the targets of terrorist attacks and more specifically, terrorists are planning to conduct suicide attacks in Mumbai or New Delhi.         
	Former Australia coach John Buchanan, without having seen the latest government travel advice, however, believes the tour of Pakistan should go ahead to prove that terrorists cannot disrupt the flow of daily life.         
	I think it (terrorism) is bigger than cricket. Cricket would be the medium by which you can keep making life as normal as possible, Buchanan said.         
	My opinion would be definitely to go, not just to Pakistan but if there were similar issues anywhere. That would be my personal viewpoint, obviously without access to the information Cricket Australia might have.         
	A lot of the time our impressions of how dangerous things may be are somewhat exaggerated when you are actually in the place.         
	Cricket Australia spokesman Peter Young said DFATs advice would be crucial in a final decision on Pakistan but did not react on the security concerns in India.         
	There will be a visit to Canberra for a government briefing in early March. Well get the most detailed inside information before we sit down with the players and the players association to take the next step, he said.

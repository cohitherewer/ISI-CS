	Dhaka: Feeling the heat after the teams morale-sagging defeat against India, Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson on Friday admitted that the side has failed to show any character, leading to a furore back home.         
	Pakistans worst defeat against India  a 140-run pounding by Mahendra Singh Dhonis men on Tuesday  prompted a furious cricket board chief Nasim Ashraf to seek an immediate explanation from team manager Talat Ali on the poor performance of the team and the roles of Lawson and captain Shoaib Malik in particular.         
	Lawson said Ashraf was entitled to his opinion, even though the Australian admitted Pakistan failed to show any character against the arch-rivals.         
	There was no strong reaction by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Lawson told reporters on the eve of the tri-series final.         
	Though he admitted Pakistan could not live up to the expectation, Lawson said he was not unduly worried about what others have to say about the teams performance.         
	We played uncharacteristically recently.         
	The players know that and that is why people have reacted to the defeat in this way, he said.         
	Asked if players were not gelling well, as reported in a section of the media, an angry Lawson said: It is incorrect to say that there is no harmony in the team.         
	On whether the team was missing pace duo Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, Lawson said: No, we are not (missing them).           (PTI)

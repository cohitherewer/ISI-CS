      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan came back from one goal down to beat 10-man Mohammedan Sporting of Dhaka 3-1 and stormed into the semi-finals of the 113th IFA Shield at the Barasat stadium on Monday. 
    
	Captain Bhaichung Bhutia led the fightback by example, scoring a brace while Ishfaq Ahmed netted the third to help the green-and-maroons set up the date with Santos FC of South Africa on Wednesday. 
    
	The Dhaka outfit, who started on a positive note, went ahead in the 40th minute through Enamul Hoque Sharifs strike. But Bhaichung put his team back in the reckoning immediately, scoring his first goal in the 45th minute and then the second one in the first-half injury-time. 
    
	The India captain, however, missed his hattrick when he failed to covert a penalty. Razani Kanta Bormon brought down Sewram Gobin inside the box, forcing the referee to point to the dreaded spot. 
    
	The Dhaka side suffered a blow to their chances when Razani Kanta Bormon received the marching order following double booking in the 67th minute. Ishfaq completed the turnaround for Mohun Bagan soon after.

	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singhs second-place finish in the Indonesia Open saw him move 10 places up to No. 83 in the world golf rankings on Monday, just one spot behind Jyoti Randhawa who remains Indias highest-ranked golfer at No. 82.         
	Jeev came close to lifting his second European Tour title, in Jakarta on Sunday, only to bogey the final hole and hand Felipe Aguilar of Chile the title.         
	Randhawa, ranked 85th last week, moved up three places after his tied seventh-place finish in Jakarta. He is also the second-highest ranked Asian, though way behind No. 8 K.J. Choi of South Korea.         
	Indian Masters winner S.S.P. Chowrasia, who skipped the Jakarta event, is the No. 3 Indian at 164, followed by Gaurav Ghei (214) and Shiv Kapur (267). Arjun Atwal is at 375 and Rahil Gangjee at 392.         
	Randhawa also crossed the $2 million barrier. He received $30,960 for his efforts in Jakarta that took his career earnings to $2,009,509. He is only the second player, after Thongchai Jaidee, to surpass the $2 million barrier. The Thai leads with $2,605,237.         
	Still on top of the Asian Order of Merit is Chowrasia with $416,660, while Jeev rose to second after picking up $133,330 in Jakarta.         
	Chowrasia will be seen in action on the Asian Tour at the inaugural SAIL Open in Noida from Wednesday.             Jyoti Randhawa            WORLD RANKINGS

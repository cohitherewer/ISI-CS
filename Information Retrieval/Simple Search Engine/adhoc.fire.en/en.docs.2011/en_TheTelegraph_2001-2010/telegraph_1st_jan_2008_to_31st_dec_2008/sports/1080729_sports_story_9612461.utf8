The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PROMISES MADE amp; DELIVERED
                                                                                                                                                                                                     PROMISES MADE amp; DELIVERED
                      
	Prasun Mukherjee made several promises before becoming the CAB president. We have tried to keep all our promises as far as possible in such a short time, said Mukherjee on Monday.         
	The following is a list of what he had promised and what was delivered during his reign.         
	 Transparency in administration  The CAB has never been more transparent I am always accessible and the members can now get to know about the associations functioning directly from me, said Mukherjee. While an attempt has been made to make the set-up more professional with the appointment of a chief executive officer, his powers are very limited.         
	 Expansion of the game to the grassroots level, especially the districts  Weve given the district associations Rs 50,000 to improve infrastructure Weve sent coaches and tried to improve the facilities, said Mukherjee. The oppositions joint secretary candidate Biswarup Dey, however, counters the presidents claims. If that was the case then why arent there any quality players, he asked.         
	 Eden lease and renovation  Despite all efforts, Mukherjee has failed to renew the lease. The renovation has also been delayed. We wanted the lease for a longer period this time There have been several correspondences with various levels of the government. It should come shortly, said Mukherjee.         
	 Setting up of the Eastern wing of the NCA  Land for this has been identified at Howrah. But very little has been done apart from that. Mukherjee, though, claims money has been earmarked for the project.         
	 Overall improvement of the game in the state  The results suggest otherwise. There is very little to show apart from making the national one-dayers final. Bengal were demoted to Plate Group in Ranji Trophy. Bengal failed to qualify for the knockout phase in the Under-19 and Under-22 categories. Bengal managed to make the next round only in Under-17.

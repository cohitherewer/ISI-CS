The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer: We stuck to a plan 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Zaheer: We stuck to a plan 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: Zaheer Khan, who took five for 91, was all praise for Ishant Sharma on Friday. Ishant claimed four wickets in Australias first innings.         
	Ishant is always ready to take the responsibility, he said at a press conference.               
	The following are excerpts:                 
	The wicket         
	It is not an easy wicket to bowl on. Its slow and the ball is keeping low. You just have to work out a way which is useful to you in terms of getting wickets. Its hard work, but we are prepared for it. Ishant and I got nine wickets between us and we cant complain much about the pitch. It was important to start well under the circumstances and Viru and Gambhir have done just that. Its a big positive for us.         
	His five-wicket haul         
	Its a great feeling to get five wickets in an innings in typical subcontinent conditions. Its something special. Im enjoying it.         
	The gameplan         
	The plan was to make run scoring difficult for them. Weve achieved it and thats a big plus. I think we bowled to our plan.         
	His poor show in the first session on Friday         
	I couldnt get my rhythm going in the first session. Maybe I was trying a little too much in terms of length and all. I wanted to be a bit more attacking which didnt work. But in the second spell I decided to go slow. It paid off.         
	The fielding         
	Everyone tried their best. The intensity was there right through. Weve done a great job by restricting them to 430         
	On bowling in tandem with Ishant         
	Ishant is shaping up really well. He is working hard and its encouraging to see a youngsters progress. He is always ready to take the responsibility. Bowling with him is good since he keeps generating pace at the other end.

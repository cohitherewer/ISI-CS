The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England need to find killer instinct
                                                                                                                                                                                                     England need to find killer instinct
                    GUEST COLUMN    Geoffrey Boycott                                  
	I find it remarkable that Peter Moores, the England coach, should have come away from Lords proclaiming that Michael Vaughan must be Englands captain for next summers Ashes.         
	Yes, he may have scored a very splendid and aesthetically pleasing hundred. But only the other day, England were saying that consistency should be their watchword. When you consider that Vaughan has apparently been installed for the next 18 months, on the back of one excellent innings, its just another example of coaching double-speak.         
	Consistency is great; a killer instinct would be even better. New Zealand are a hard-working side, but England should really be looking to beat them in three-and-a-half days. I know there was plenty of bad weather around this week, and more than 160 overs lost in the match. But look at it the other way: England had a fresh pitch to bowl on, in overcast conditions, while New Zealand had two debutant kids, and three other batsmen who had never played in this country before. They should have been bowled out for 177, not 277.         
	Opportunities kept slipping away. Battling through the rain-breaks, Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss should have provided the perfect platform. But the middle order lost its way and New Zealand won every hour and every session on Sunday.         
	Even on the last morning, when the England bowlers picked three quick wickets, Strauss released the pressure by dropping a sitter at first slip. That meant another hour wasted before they could get Jamie How out. The moments were there for England to grasp, but they werent good enough.         
	Vaughan may have called New Zealand workmanlike, but the same could be said of England. A lot more will be needed to beat Australia if thats the ultimate goal next year.         
	Ask yourself, when do England look a classy outfit? When Kevin Pietersen is in full flow, playing outrageous shots, and bristling with intent to take on any bowler. That gets our attention. When Vaughan is scoring runs hes a beautiful player whos always pleasing on the eye. Other than that, the rest are good, but not special. Ask yourself which of the English players would get into the Australian team. The answer is Pietersen. One guy.         
	I accept that England have a couple of good bowlers in Ryan Sidebottom and Monty Panesar. But Monty wouldnt play for Australia; they dont accept anyone whos not a top-class fielder. Although Sidebottom has been going well, the Aussies have half a dozen good seamers, including Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson and Ben Hilfenhaus.         
	Over the last few years England have lost some quality cricketers. We have hardly seen Andrew Flintoff, who is the most iconic figure in the English game. He hasnt appeared in a Test since the Australian tour more than a year ago. Four years ago Steve Harmison was the best bowler in the world. Now hes nowhere.         
	There was Marcus Trescothick opening the innings, a very good batsman who is now mentally shot, and there was Simon Jones, these days a frail shadow of himself. Add in Strauss, who is still searching for his best form, and Matthew Hoggard, who has a broken thumb. Its been a grim old time for the Ashes heroe s of Trafalgar Square.         
	So England have lost a lot of quality and havent yet found anything to take its place. Weve got to stop kidding ourselves. New Zealand have four to five good players, mostly the ones who went to the Indian Premier League.         
	Brendon McCullum, Jacob Oram, Daniel Vettori and Chris Martin, plus Kyle Mills on a good day. The rest are kids learning their trade. I dont mean to belittle New Zealand, but England should be outclassing them. Not just winning, but winning well, to show the public and media that they will be a threat to Australia.         
	Vaughan has been saying that he can see good things developing with this team, but they had better hurry up and show it.         
	England looked very flat on Sunday and Monday. Vaughan must stop talking up his own players, and convince us by performances that we are on the right road to producing a top side.         
	Then, perhaps, we can start thinking about the best options for next summer.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

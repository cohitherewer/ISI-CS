	 BCCI vows to save Zimbabwe  
	Dubai: Throwing its weight behind Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC), the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has made it clear that it would oppose any move to expel the trouble-torn African nation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) in the governing bodys executive committee meeting on Wednesday.   
	We are very clear that we would like to fully support Zimbabwe on the issue of full membership of the ICC, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said.    
	Mahela view         
	 Karachi: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene on Monday said that he has no complaints with the tight Asia Cup schedule as it was not a new thing in international cricket.         
	I think in international cricket one has to be used to play such a tough schedule. Our players are fit and have been working hard and preparing for this tournament. In fact it was much tougher conditions in Lahore, it is much better in Karachi, Jayawardene said.     
	Shoaib appeal         
	Karachi: Unwilling to accept even a reduced 18-month ban, Shoaib Akhtar has filed a writ petition before the Lahore high court contesting the original five-year ban imposed on him by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).         
	A PCB-appointed appellate tribunal had reduced the original five-year ban to 18 months, besides being fined seven million rupees, but Akhtar was not happy with the verdict.         
	We feel the decision of the PCB in the first place to ban him for five years was illegal and unjustified, Akhtars lawyer Bilal Minto said on Monday         
	We believe the fast bowler is being prevented from playing cricket for his country by an illegal decision of the board. The ban itself is very harsh. We are contesting the entire ban itself, he added.    
	Bracken help         
	 Calcutta: Australia bowler Nathan Bracken visited local youth groups in Grenada last week to show his support for the ICCs partnership with Unicef and UNAIDS and to raise awareness about the HIV virus, says A Staff Reporter.         
	According to an ICC release, Bracken took time out from the series against the West Indies to visit Grenada Youth Development Centre.

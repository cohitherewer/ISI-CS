The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Swann not too keen on India tour
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Swann not too keen on India tour
                      
	London: After Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff, England spinner Graeme Swann too has developed cold feet and is reluctant to tour India following the terror attacks in Mumbai.         
	Swann said though he has full faith on security adviser Reg Dickason, who is yet to give a go-ahead to the tour, he was not particularly keen on returning to India for the two-match Test series.         
	I wouldnt be 100 per cent happy with going back, you know, the off-spinner said.         
	Theres a security report being compiled and I have every faith in Reg Dickason, if he comes back saying, Look guys, its safe, we can go back there, we can do some good and get playing sport then I would go. But until that report comes back, certainly at the minute, Im not that keen, to be honest, the player told the BBC.         
	Incidentally, pacer James Anderson is also likely to stay back to be with his pregnant wife.         
	Swann admitted that skipping the India tour might jeopardise his prospect but said cricket lost its importance to him after the Mumbai terror strikes.         
	Obviously its tricky for people like myself who are trying to forge a regular place in the team, It comes down to thinking, If I dont go will I miss out on future selection and stuff like that, which sort of clouds the issue a little bit. Its certainly not an easy decision to make and not one that anyone will be enjoying.         
	You could potentially do some good, but youve got to weigh that up against and factor in, if it is still dangerous, what good are you going to do if youre just providing another target, said the Nottinghamshire spinner.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh on Monday was banned for the remainder of the Indian Premier League (IPL) after he was found guilty of slapping Sreesanth of Kings XI Punjab in Mohali.         
	Match Referee and adjudicator Farokh Engineer, who held a hearing here after the Punjab team lodged a formal complaint against Harbhajan, also slapped the Mumbai Indians stand-in captain with a fine of 100 per cent match fees from the third match onwards.         
	Harbhajan, who pleaded guilty and also apologised for his behaviour, later vowed to make a comeback. He thanked the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for supporting him throughout his career and promised to try his best to bring a smile back on the faces of those who backed him.         
	Mumbai Indians coach Lalchand Rajput also earned the wrath of Engineer for not stopping Harbhajan from slapping Sreesanth despite standing just behind the off-spinner when the incident took place. Rajput, a former India coach, has been fined 50 per cent of his match fees under the Level II offence as per the ICC Code of Conduct.         
	Addressing a chaotic press conference after a two-hour hearing in a five-star hotel here, IPL chairman Lalit Modi said: As a penalty for the level 4.2 offence committed by Harbhajan Singh, we hereby order that he be banned for the rest of the remaining matches of the first IPL event.         
	Modi, who did the entire talking and hardly allowed Engineer to air his views, said Harbhajan had the right to go for an appeal. In that case, an appeal commission would be formed to consider the appeal.         
	Sources said that the off-spinner is unlikely to appeal against the decision.         
	Engineer, according to Modi, was also unhappy with the way Sreesanth conducted himself in the ground. After the hearing, the former India wicketkeeper warned Sreesanth to control his behaviour or to face strict action in future.         
	Asked what exactly Harbhajan did on that fateful night, the IPL chairman said the video footage had clinching evidence showing the spinner shaking hands with Punjab players. Sreesanth was third in the line but, instead of shaking hands, Harbhajan actually slapped him.         
	Under the ICC Code of Conduct, Level 4.2 offence relates to physically assaulting a fellow player, match official or spectators, the penalty for which ranges from a ban for a minimum of 5 Tests or 10 ODIs and a maximum of life ban.         
	The press conference also had a touch of melodrama in the end when Modi called in Harbhajan and Sreesanth to shake hands in front of the media. Engineer, who got his first chance to say something, quipped: We are all human beings and mistakes do happen.         
	While Sreesanth chose to keep quiet, Harbhajan spoke a few words. He looked distressed and said: All I want to say is whatever happened and whatever I did was grossly wrong. Sreesanth is like my brother. We have played together and we will play together again.         
	I got punishment for whatever I did but the BCCI has always treated me like its child and I hope they will continue to support me. When I come back to play again, I will bring a smile back on your faces, he said.  
	ICC Code of Conduct: Level 4 offences   
	The offences set out from 4.1 to 4.4 below are Level 4 offences.         
	 4.1 Threat of assault on an umpire or referee         
	 4.2 Physical assault of another player, umpire, referee, official or spectator         
	 4.3 Any act of violence on the field of play         
	 4.4 Using language or gestures that seriously offends, insults, humiliates, intimidates, threatens, disparages or vilifies another person on the basis of that persons race, religion, gender, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin

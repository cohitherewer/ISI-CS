                                                   Ranadeb signs for Knight Riders
            CRICKET BRIEFS                
	 Calcutta: Bengal pacer Ranadeb Bose on Friday signed for the Kolkata Knight Riders. Ranadeb thus completed the quota of four local players for the Shah Rukh Khan-owned IPL team. Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhhiman Saha and Sourashish Lahiri had earlier joined the Sourav Ganguly-led and John Buchanan-coached team.                 
	CAB appoints new officer  
	Calcutta: The CAB on Friday appointed Ashwin Kapoor, the former general manager of Goodricke, as its executive officer. Kapoor, who is on a one-year contract, will draw a monthly salary of Rs 35,000. The decision was taken after a working committee meeting.   
	Though his role is yet to be defined, Kapoor will initially look after the IPL matters.                 
	Dalmiya case  
	Calcutta: The perjury case moved by former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, charging the present committee of the Indian cricket board with telling lie before the court, came up for hearing before Nadira Patheria on Friday.   
	Dalmiya had filed the case soon after the court passed its judgement setting aside the BCCIs decision of suspending him on the charges of defalcating the Pilcom account.         
	Dalmiya alleged in his petition that the BCCIs present dispensation had made false statements and placed fake documents before the court to establish his guilt and to obtain court orders against him.                 
	No injunction  
	Calcutta: The 12th judge of the city civil court, M.M. Ghosh, declined to pass any interim injunction on the selling of tickets of Indian Premier League matches as desired by the Cricket Members Forum of Bengal, an association of some members of Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB). The judge, however, admitted the petition for hearing and asked the petitioner organisation and the CAB to file affidavits by April 8. On April 8 the matter will come up for hearing before the court.

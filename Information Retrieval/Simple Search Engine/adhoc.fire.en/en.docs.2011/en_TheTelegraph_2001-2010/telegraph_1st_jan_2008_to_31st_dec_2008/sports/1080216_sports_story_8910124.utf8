                                                   A lesson to watch Sachin: Raina
                      
	Adelaide: So far Sachin Tendulkar has a modest run in the tri-series and the senior most pro is working on tackling balls pitched outside the off-stump before Indias Sunday match against Australia.         
	As he chose to skip an indoor session for a change and strode out to the outdoor nets, his advice to his net bowler, fielding coach Robin Singh, was to bowl on and around the off-stump.         
	Tendulkar would leave the balls marginally pitched outside the off-stump as he tried to perfect his judgement on which deliveries to play and which to leave.         
	His instruction to Robin was to bowl him deliveries which gain height on the off-stump. Height Bowl me deliveries which gain height on the off-stump, said Tendulkar.         
	Suresh Raina, still waiting for his first turn in the middle on this tour, was watching Tendulkar from close quarters.         
	Its a lesson to watch him from close quarters. The way he prepares, his shot selection, his technique is all a great lesson for us youngsters, Raina said.           (PTI)

	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto believes that their new coach Karim Bencherifa will achieve success during the forthcoming season.         
	The 31-year old Barreto, who joined the clubs practice on Wednesday morning after returning from Sao Paulo, said: He is not a stranger to Indian soccer He has seen the Calcutta teams for the last couple of years. He has been quite successful with other teams and I feel he will achieve the same here too.         
	He needs to settle down quickly. The sooner he gets accustomed to conditions here, the better for us, he said.         
	Barreto was happy with the team this season.

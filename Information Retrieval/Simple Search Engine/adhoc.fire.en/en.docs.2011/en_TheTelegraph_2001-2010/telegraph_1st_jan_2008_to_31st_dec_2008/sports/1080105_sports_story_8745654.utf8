The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal sets up semi-final date with Moya
                                                  Nadal sets up semi-final date with Moya
  - Chennai Open 
  -  World No. 2 eases past Garcia-Lopez 6-3, 6-2         SREEMOY TALUKDAR            Carlos Moya of Spain serves to Florent Serra of France during their quarter final match at the Chennai Open on Friday (AFP)                                 
	Chennai: The dolphin is a benevolent aquatic mammal, playful and friendly. But when tattooed on the right bicep, it can turn a killer.         
	Unseeded Frenchman Florent Serra discovered the malevolent nature of the dolphin as its owner, Carlos Moya, cantered to a 6-3, 6-4 win to move into the semi-finals of the Chennai Open on Friday.         
	Each time the right hand went up to serve, the dolphin glistened in sweat amid the lights of the Nungambakkam Stadium. And the impact of each serve was felt by the hapless world No. 92 as Moya virtually played a chanceless match to continue his love affair with Chennai.         
	Its important that the veteran remains on top of his game since he will need all his expertise and experience to tame his semi-final opponent, bosom friend and compatriot Rafael Nadal.         
	The world No.2 pulverised unseeded Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3, 6-2 in one hour and 19 minutes in a match that was affected badly by rain.         
	Unseasonal downpour seemed to be playing spoilsport when the top seed had just started the match but the loyal few who stayed back as the match restarted at 11pm, were treated to some exhilarating tennis.         
	Lopez, ranked 88 spots below Nadal, matched his famed opponent shot for shot.         
	But it becomes impossible to dominate a man who floats around the court and fires forehands and double-handed backhands from impossible angles.         
	Its not as if Nadal slammed too many winners. Just nine compared to Lopezs 13. But he was limited to eight unforced errors whereas Lopez, under pressure to hit one more shot than he would have against most opponents, made 20 unforced errors.         
	Nadal achieved breaks in the eighth game of the first set and two more in the fifth and seventh in the second set to seal the match. Nadal first broke Lopezs resistance with uncompromising power hitting when he sensed that his opponent was tiring. He then pounced on him, hammering the ball with immense power every time.         
	His semi-final showdown against Moya will be a spectacle.         
	But when it comes to Chennai, Moya cannot be underestimated. The former world No. 1, who is in his sixth appearance in this south Indian metropolis, has won 21 of his 24 matches here and has reached the quarter finals each time.         
	Serra had met Moya once earlier and in the red clay of Roland Garros, the Spaniard had won in straight sets.         
	The world No.17, Moya, got the all-important break in the fourth game of the first set when at 15-30, Serra made a double fault. Moya didnt need a second invitation. He kept his cool on a wet court to seal the first set.         
	Looking in regal touch, the Spaniard in the second set broke Serra in the second game. The third game was most entertaining as Serra staved off four break points to hang on.         
	During a recent chat, Moya had said he is all for hawk eye and technology as long as it takes the mistakes out of the game.         
	Ironically, he became the beneficiary of two glaring errors as a frustrated Serra was seeing arguing with the chair umpire.         
	Losing cool at any point of the match isnt a good idea. Serra failed to get the break back and his Chennai Open campaign ended when Moya slammed an ace on his second match point.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sachin sure of victory vs Delhi
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: For Sachin Tendulkar, the level of commitment remains the same irrespective of the level of competition he is involved in. As a cricketer, he is always eager to put his best foot forward whether it is Test cricket or a Twenty20 tournament.         
	The icon of Indian cricket, who was at the Kotla on Friday on the eve of the Indian Premier League (IPL) match between Mumbai Indians and Delhi DareDevils, said his love and respect for the game motivates him whenever he has the bat in his hands.         
	Asked what difference he experienced while playing for the country and then a franchise side, the Mumbai Indians captain replied: I always hold the bat with a determination to score runs. It doesnt matter whether I play for India, in IPL or against my son. I love and respect the game and give my best whenever I play.         
	The star of Indian cricket was confident that if weather holds, his team would be able to beat the DareDevils in their own den.         
	He scoffed at a suggestion that the experience and class of Glenn McGrath may make a dent in the strong Mumbai batting line-up.         
	Matches are played between 22 players and not individuals, he said. Eventually what matters is how we perform as a unit.         
	I have no doubt about our team winning the match on Saturday, Tendulkar said. A lot of cricket is still left to be played. When the tournament started, people had different opinions about us after four matches.         
	But we have come back with a bang.         
	Tendulkar admitted that he was upset with some of the umpiring decisions in the last match against Kings XI. We have lodged an official complaint against the third umpire. Lets see what happens, he said.         
	The Mumbai team management is also apprehensive that the whole strategy for the match may have to be redrawn if the capital experiences further rain.         
	In a truncated match, team tactics undergo huge transformations. So, we are keeping our fingers crossed. Its good that Shaun (Pollock) is much better now (he had a stiff back).         
	He should be fit to play, said the Mumbai captain.

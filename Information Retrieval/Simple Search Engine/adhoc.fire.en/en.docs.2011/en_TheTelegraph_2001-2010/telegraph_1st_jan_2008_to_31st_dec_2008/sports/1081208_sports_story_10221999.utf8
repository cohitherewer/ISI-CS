	Bowden to replace Rauf  Calcutta: Billy Bowden will replace Asad Rauf in the first India-England Test match in Chennai even though the Pakistan umpire is expected to officiate in the second Test at Mohali.  Daryl Harper is the other ICC umpire for the series, which will have Jeff Crowe as the Match Referee.  Pakistan nationals require city-specific visas when travelling to India.

With the change in venues he required a new visa but due to the weekend, followed by the Eid al-Adha holidays, there was insufficient time for one to be issued, so he has had to step down from the first Test.

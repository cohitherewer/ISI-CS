The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bose, Borah in the race
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bose, Borah in the race
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: The next bunch of selectors will be hand-picked by the principal office-bearers of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), with the president having the maximum say, but the views of key affiliates are to be taken into account.         
	Informally, at least.         
	That, indeed, is supposed to be the way forward in having full-time (paid) selectors.         
	The appointments will be made at the September 27-28 AGM, in Mumbai, but nobody from the BCCI has so far got in touch with anybody in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), the biggest affiliate from the East.         
	Perhaps, that has everything to do with the CAB again being headed by Jagmohan Dalmiya, who has been at loggerheads with the Sharad Pawar group, which is now in complete control of the BCCI.         
	Three years ago, its Dalmiya who was running the show from Calcutta to Calicut and just about everywhere else as well.         
	However, Easts man on the new senior selection committee may still be from Bengal  Gopal Bose, who has played unofficial Tests, besides turning out in an ODI.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, only two names are being seriously considered  61-year-old Bose and Assams Rajesh Borah, who is 40.         
	That Bose is in the frame to succeed Orissas Ranjib Biswal was first reported in these columns, on Sunday.         
	Borah wont, of course, qualify if it remains mandatory for a senior selector to have retired at least 10 years ago.         
	The BCCIs working committee has recommended precisely that, but theres a good chance the period could be halved to five years.         
	Apparently, there was to have been a selectors-specific meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday, but that didnt take place as president-elect Shashank Manohar didnt come.         
	The five zones wont be nominating the selectors, as was done for decades, but every zone will still have one representative on each committee.

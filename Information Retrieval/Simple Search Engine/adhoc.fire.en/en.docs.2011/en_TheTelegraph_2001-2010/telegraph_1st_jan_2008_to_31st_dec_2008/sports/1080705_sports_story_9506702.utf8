	New Delhi: The Indian football team, which arrived in Portugal on Thursday for a 12-day training-cum-exposure-trip, will play their first match against Gouveia Select on Saturday.         
	According to information received here, the Indian team landed in Cristiano Ronaldos country eight hours behind schedule after they missed their connecting flight from Frankfurt.         
	The team will stay in the mountain city of Gouveia till Sunday before travelling to Vieira De Leiria for two more matches on Wednesday and next Saturday.

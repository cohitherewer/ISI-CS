The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BOA cries foul over Sania moms role
                                                                                                                                                                                                     BOA cries foul over Sania moms role
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A senior Bengal Olympic Association (BOA) official is planning to write a letter to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) protesting the inclusion of Sania Mirzas mother in the Beijing-bound Indian contingent.         
	A senior official in the BOA, who declined to be named, questioned the rationale behind including Mrs Nasima Mirza in the contingent, while barring Bengal heptathlete Sushmita Singa Roys coach Kuntal Roy.         
	I will write a letter to the IOA in protest of this move, the official said. If Mrs Mirza can be included, why cannot Kuntal go with Sushmita.         
	I feel Sushmitas confidence level would be high if Kuntal goes with her. This is her first big tournament and here she needs some moral support, he added.         
	Sushmita also felt that Kuntal Roys presence would help in her performance. Sushmita is the second woman from the state after archer Dola Banerjee to participate in the Olympics.         
	Meanwhile, a highly-placed source in the IOA said that Sania Mirzas mother has been included in the contingent as the manager, not as the coach.         
	Mrs Mirza will be going as the manager but not as a coach What was out in the newspapers was wrong, the official clarified.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India draw a blank after double strike
                                                                                                                                                                                           India draw a blank after double strike
                      
	Beijing: A day after creating history in the Olympics by winning two medals, India had little to cheer about on Thursday with wrestler Rajiv Tomar crashing out of the 120kg freestyle event without much of a fight.         
	The euphoria of the medal-winning efforts of unheralded grappler Sushil Kumar and boxer Vijender Kumar quickly gave way to disappointment as Tomar, the lone Indian in the fray on Thursday, failed to make much of an impression in the wrestling arena.         
	After Abhinav Bindras gold-winning feat during the first week of the sporting extravaganza, India had created a record of sorts on Wednesday with the 25-year-old Sushil clinching a bronze in wrestling while Vijender put himself on course for a silver or gold medal by romping into the semi-finals of boxing.         
	Tomar fought a slipshod qualifying round bout against Steve Mocco and the American hardly broke a sweat as he blanked the Indian grappler 4-0 to show him the exit door.         
	To be honest, this was a below-par show by Rajiv. Of course Mocco was superior of the two but I still feel Rajiv could have done better. We did not expect him to win but Rajiv did not try enough, coach P.R. Sondhi said. Tactically speaking, Rajiv was always cornered and then Mocco came up with a well-executed plan in the second period and we knew it was all over.

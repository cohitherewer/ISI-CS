                                                                                                                                                                                                       Paes, Dlouhy in last eight
                  Leander Paes                     
	New York: Seventh seeds Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy advanced to the US Open mens doubles quarter finals with a comfortable straight-set victory over South African Rik de Voest and Australias Ashley Fisher here.         
	The Indo-Czech pair beat their rivals 6-3, 6-3 in a lopsided third-round encounter.         
	Paes and Dlouhy will now take on the winners of the other third-round match between the top seeded Canadian-Serb pair of Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic and Robert Lindstedt (Sweden) and Jarkko Nieminnen (Finland).         
	The seventh-seeded pair had overcame a second set lapse to quell the challenge of Eduardo Schwank of Argentina and Potito Starace of Italy 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 in their second round match.         
	The Indo-Czech pair quickly went ahead by pocketing the first set in 25 minutes, breaking their rivals once but Schwank-Starace fought back and drew parity by clinching the second.         
	Paes and Dlouhy got into their elements in the all important decisive third set, which they won after converting one of the two chances they got.         
	In Round I, Leander and his Czech partner had defeated the Spanish pair of Oscar Hernandez and Albert Montanes 6-7, 6-1, 6-4.         
	The veteran Indian seems to be in fine fettle after stepping down from Davis Cup captaincy recently.         
	Among the juniors, 12th seed Yuki Bhambri beat American Denis Kudla 6-2, 5-7, 6-3. The 16-year-old will next take on unseeded Serb Filip Krajinovic.           (PTI)

	Ohio: Arjun Atwal risks missing the weekend action at the Nationwide Childrens Hospital invitational after a five-over 76 in the opening round left him tied 116th at the $ 750,000 event here.         
	Atwal found the going tough as four bogeys and two double bogeys flew off his club against three birdies. Bryce Molder, Bill Lunde, Kelly Grunewald and Dave Schultz were tied for the lead with cards of four-under 67.

	Jeev Milkha shares lead in British Masters  Sutton Coldfield: Jeev Milkha Singh shared the lead with Ryder Cup star Lee Westwood even though the Indian was still six holes away from completing the second round, which was suspended due to thick fog, at the British Masters.  The Chandigarh pro was three-under after completing 12 holes, which took his overall score to six-under 138 for a share of the lead with Englishman Westwood (70).  It was not the kind of start that Jeev might have been hoping when he stumbled to a first-hole bogey but the in-form golfer made amends with a birdie on the very next hole.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB will have to cough up more for Yakubu
                                                                                                                                                                                             EB will have to cough up more for Yakubu
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Yakubu                           
	New Delhi: East Bengals attempts to get Ghanaian striker Yusif Yakubu released from Salgaocar remained inconclusive on Tuesday despite the Calcutta club offering to return the Rs. 10 lakh that Yakubu received as an advance from the Goan side.         
	According to sources, the Salgaocar manager, R.A.J. Gomes, who met the East Bengal representative, Swapan Bal in Goa, made it clear that the red and gold brigade would have to cough up an additional Rs. 10 lakh as compensation to get Yakubu cleared for the season.         
	Bal, who arrived in Goa with a bank draft of Rs. 10 lakh in his bag, could not meet the additional demand as he did not have the approval of his club officials. On Wednesday, however, East Bengal is likely to offer some more money to get the Ghanaian released.         
	Yakubu, who agreed to play for the Goan club for Rs. 37 lakh at the start of the season before changing his mind, also tendered a letter of apology to the Salgaocar secretary.         
	Interestingly, if East Bengal fail to meet the demands of Salgaocar, the Goan outfit will be in no position to use the services of Yakubu. According to AIFF rules, teams in the Second Division I-League can register only two foreigners and Salgaocar have already recruited two Brazilians.         
	Meanwhile, at least half a dozen senior Churchill Brothers players met the club supremo Churchill Alemao in Goa on Tuesday to demand the removal of the coach Emeka Ezeugo. Later, Alemao also met Emeka.         
	Churchill sources said that players, including the national team stars like Gourmangi Singh and Govin Singh are not happy with Emekas way of handling the team and would demand for a new coach.

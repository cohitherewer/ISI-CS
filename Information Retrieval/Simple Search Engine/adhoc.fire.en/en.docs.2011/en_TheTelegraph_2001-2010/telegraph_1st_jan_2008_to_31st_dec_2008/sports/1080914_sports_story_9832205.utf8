The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand draws 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Anand draws 
                            
	Bilbao: Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand played out an easy draw against Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the ninth and penultimate round of the Bilbao Grand Slam chess tournament to remain at the joint fifth spot here.         
	With his seventh draw in nine games Anand, playing with white, took his points tally to seven points in the soccer-like scoring system with just one round to enter the super-category tournament.         
	All the three games, in the six players double round-robin tournament, ended in draws. Magnus Carlsen could do little against the solid play of Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan who played white, while Levon Aronian survived a scare at the hands of Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine.         
	The standings remained unchanged, and Topalov remained atop the table with 14 points, a full point ahead of Aronian. Ivanchuk and Carlsen share the third spot with 12 points each, while Anand and Radjabov are way behind at seven points.         
	Anand faced the Caro Kann defense by Topalov. Going for a variation that has been discarded in favour of new variations and research, Anand did not get anything special in the middle game and Topalov equalised without much ado.         
	The pieces got exchanged at regular intervals and the players reached a drawn rook and pawns endgame in quick time. After 41 moves the peace was signed.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nasri double sinks United
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nasri double sinks United

	London: Frenchman Samir Nasri stung champions Manchester United with two goals at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday as Arsenal secured a deserved 2-1 victory to reignite their Premier League title challenge.         
	Arsenal survived an early storm in a magnificent free-flowing game before the inspired Nasri struck in each half to lift the Gunners above United into third place.         
	Substitute Rafaels late volley for United could not prevent a second league defeat of the season. More worryingly, United have now taken just one point from their clashes with title rivals Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season.         
	Arsenal have 23 points from 12 games, three behind leaders Chelsea, who are at Blackburn Rovers on Sunday, and Liverpool who host West Bromwich Albion later. United have 21.         
	Hull Citys remarkable start to the season hit the buffers at home to Bolton Wanderers as they went down 1-0. The win lifted Bolton out of the bottom three and up to ninth place.         
	New Portsmouth manager Tony Adams got his first victory since taking over from Harry Redknapp, with Jermain Defoe scoring a late penalty for a 2-1 win at Sunderland.         
	Stoke City drew 0-0 with Wigan Athletic while West Ham Uniteds poor form continued as they conceded three late goals in a 3-1 defeat by Everton at Upton Park.         
	Manchester Uniteds players spent time at their training ground with Diego Maradona this week and could have done with the Argentine greats finishing ability early on against Arsenal.         
	Michael Carrick volleyed wide, Dimitar Berbatov had a goal ruled out after straying offside and Wayne Rooney blazed a gilt-edged chance over the crossbar in rainy London before Arsenal moved into gear.         
	Nasri, signed from Olympique Marseille in July, opened the scoring for Arsenal after 22 minutes with a deflected shot.         
	He struck again with a thumping right-foot shot just after halftime to give Arsenal a cushion although Rafaels stunning late volley ensured a tense finale.         
	It was fantasy football, United manager Alex Ferguson told reporters. It was like playground football at times...you attack, then well attack.         
	Our determination and drive to try and rescue a point was fantastic. It was as good a game of football as youll see this season.         
	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was delighted with his injury-hit sides response to being written off as title contenders in some quarters after dropping points at home to Tottenham Hotspur and away to Stoke City.         
	We had one accident against Stoke and there was hysteria, Wenger said. The difference today was that we took our chances and they didnt.         
	Wenger never lost faith in his players despite their recent poor form.         
	I didnt doubt the spirit of my players, he said. I acknowledge we made some mistakes, especially against Tottenham, but I didnt question their spirit, quality or ability to play for the championship.         
	Its a team answer. We showed we had the squad  that is questioned many times  and we showed no matter who plays they have the spirit.

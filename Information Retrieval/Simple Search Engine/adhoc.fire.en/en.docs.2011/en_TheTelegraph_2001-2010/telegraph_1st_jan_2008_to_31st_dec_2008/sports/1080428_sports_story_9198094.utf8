                                                                                                                                                                                           Australian media react to row with glee
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: That Harbhajan Singh continues to evoke strong emotions in Australia was evident again as the media reacted with glee to the latest turn of events.         
	The Courier Mail published a photograph of the temperamental Indian, titled what a slapper! with a file photograph of Harbhajan in Team India colours  his arms spread wide and tongue out in a wild celebration. Singh slap shocker screamed a headline in the Herald Sun.         
	The following are the excerpts from what the papers had to say         
	Courier Mail: Slap up timecontroversial Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh suspended for slapping Sreesanth. The 27-year-old spinner has had a poor disciplinary record since making his India debut in 1998.         
	On tour to Australia this year, Harbhajan was initially banned for three Tests after being found guilty of making racist remarks against all-rounder Andrew Symonds. He was subsequently let off with a fine on a lesser charge following an appeal.         
	The Daily Telegraph: An altercation between two Test team-mates has rocked the Indian Premier League.         
	Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh reportedly slapped Indian team-mate Sree Sreesanth across the face in a bitter aftermath to Fridays match in Mohali.         
	Sreesanth, playing for the Kings XI, was left sobbing after the clash, with team-mates consoling the fast bowler.         
	The Sydney Morning Herald: THE IPL was supposed to divide the cricketing world. Instead, its bringing an end to racial hostilities. All they need to do now is get Harbhajan Singh to stop slapping his fellow Indians around.         
	Symonds became public enemy No.1 in India late last year when he became embroiled in a spat with Harbhajan. Another drama involving the feisty Indian spinner will add to the belief that he was the main antagoniser last summer.

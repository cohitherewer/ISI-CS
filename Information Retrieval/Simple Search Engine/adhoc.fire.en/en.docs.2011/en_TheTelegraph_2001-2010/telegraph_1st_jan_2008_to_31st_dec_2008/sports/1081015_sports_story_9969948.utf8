                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pereira unlikely for Bagan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Mohun Bagan are unlikely to get the services of Marcos Pereira this season, according to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources.         
	Though no official confirmation from the AIFF was available, sources said that the members of the Players Status Committee, who were asked to look into the matter, have ruled against the Brazilian striker playing for the Calcutta team.         
	The committees final report, however, is not yet ready, sources said. The written opinion of all the members have been sent to the chairman of the committee. He is expected to sign it and send it back to the federation in the next few days, he added.         
	The secretary of the Kerala Football Association, KP Sunny is the chairman of the Players Status committee. The committee members are of the opinion that since JCT paid for Marcos Pereiras air ticket from Brazil to India the Brazilian should now play for the Phagwara side.

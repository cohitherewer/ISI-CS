The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fan critical after fall
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fan critical after fall
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: All was not hunky dory at the Salt Lake Stadium when Mohun Bagan won the Federation Cup title on Sunday. While a youth was critically injured after falling down, the trophy was damaged during the prize distribution ceremony as ecstatic fans broke all barriers to enter the ground.         
	Sanjib Jana, a 27-year-old youth, fell off the middle tier of the Salt Lake Stadium gallery just before the start of the final.         
	According to the police, Jana, a die-hard Mohun Bagan supporter, was trying to wave at the Bagan players at around 4pm when he lost his balance and fell head first on the concrete floor. Jana had gone to watch the match with his father Khokon Jana, brother-in-law Nilkamal Sarkar and nephew Abhisek.         
	He was drunk and lost his balance while trying to wave the Bagan flag and cheer along with other Mohun Bagan fans, said an officer of Bidhannagar South police station.         
	Jana was rushed to Salt Lake AMRI hospital, where he has been put under ventilation. The CT scan has revealed that there are multiple fractures in his head. His condition is very critical, said a senior official of AMRI.         
	Police added that Jana, a resident of Gangulypukur in Jadavpur, has been unemployed since July but was to join a private firm in Ranchi in January. His wife is pregnant.         
	The lack of security in the stadium came to the fore after the match when thousands of supporters scaled the fencing and ran into the ground to congratulate the players. A handful of policemen were not able to stop them and it was absolute chaos in the middle. When finance minister Asim Dasgupta handed over the trophy to Bagan players, many were busy tearing the nets of goals and the rest were all around the dais.         
	The sponsors board was broken and the trophy was also damaged while being taken to the dressing room. Jose Ramirez Barreto tried to make a victory lap but it was cut short by over-enthusiastic fans, who were all over him.         
	The authorities did not seem to have learnt from the Diego Maradona chaos.

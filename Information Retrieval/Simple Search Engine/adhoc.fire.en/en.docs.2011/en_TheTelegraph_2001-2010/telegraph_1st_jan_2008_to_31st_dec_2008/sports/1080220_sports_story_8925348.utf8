The actor is reportedly also very interested in Pakistan allrounder Shahid Afridi.         
	While its to be seen who actually make the grade, its confirmed that former Australia coach John Buchanan will be in charge of the Calcutta team. However, its to be seen what role he will play.         
	Buchanan has said that he wants a diversified role. If I was to sign with a franchise, I would need to know that I was employed to do more than just coach a team. I would like to utilise my skills of building something unique, special and sustainable in the long-term.It will be the first time that international cricketers from around the world will be up for grabs by the eight city-specific franchises who have bought teams by paying a total of $723.3 million.         
	Five iconic Indian players  Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav, Dravid, Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag  are not part of the bidding process as they have to play for their respective city franchises  Mumbai, Calcutta, Bangalore, Mohali and Delhi.

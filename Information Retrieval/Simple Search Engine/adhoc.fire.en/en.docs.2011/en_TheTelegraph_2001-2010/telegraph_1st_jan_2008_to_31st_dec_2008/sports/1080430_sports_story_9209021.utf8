                                                                                                                                                                                                     Umpire banned for two games
            HARBHAJAN UPDATE                
	 New Delhi: A day after banning Harbhajan Singh for the remainder of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the authorities on Tuesday cracked the whip on umpire Amish Saheba by suspending him for two matches for his remarks against Sreesanth. Saheba was subjected to disciplinary action for making a statement to a Mumbai newspaper about Sreesanths conduct during the match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab in Mohali where Harbhajan had slapped the Kerala speedster.         
	In the interview to the newspaper, Saheba said that Sreesanth indulged in sledging right through the match. The IPL governing council has withdrawn Amish Sahebas appointment for two matches, a BCCI release said. Apart from being suspended for two matches, Saheba has also been asked to explain his remarks to the newspaper.         
	In a related move, IPL governing council member I.S. Bindra on Tuesday slammed Saheba for his comments and said he should have mentioned it in his report on the match between Kings XI Punjab and Mumbai Indians.         
	Hope BCCI isnt harsh: Farokh         
	 New Delhi: Harbhajan Singh has been punished enough by the Indian Premier League for slapping teammate Sreesanth and the BCCI should not be very harsh when it hands out a separate penalty to the off-spinner, match referee Farokh Engineer has pleaded. Engineer, who adjudicated the hearing against Harbhajan that handed him a ban and a hefty fine, said he was hoping for a lighter sentence from the BCCI.         
	I am sure the BCCI will realise that Harbhajans punishment has been pretty harsh and I hope for Harbhajan that they are lenient on him. But I cant really comment on what the BCCI has to do, Engineer told a news channel. The former wicketkeeper said although Sreesanth, who was let off with a warning, was no angel, Harbhajans actions could not be condoned.         
	I dont think Sreesanth is an angel. He is a lovely guy and he has been warned to take it easy... Not to go beyond the mark. Harbhajan made a big mistake there, a mistake that has never been made before. You just cannot strike another person, he said.         
	Engineer said the video evidence against Harbhajan was so strong that the IPL board had to take action against the temperamental bowler.         
	Hoardings removed         
	 Mumbai: After being booted out of the Indian Premier League for slapping a rival player, Harbhajan Singh is experiencing a new low with his franchise team Mumbai Indians having decided to remove hoardings with his picture dotting Mumbai.         
	The process of removing the teams hoardings with Harbhajan is on and some posters have already been taken off from the various spots in the city, someone involved with the Mumbai Indians said on Tuesday.         
	Arthur confirms         
	 New Delhi: A day after it was reported in The Telegraph, South Africa coach Mickey Arthur has confirmed that Harbhajan Singh had abused Ashwell Prince during the recently concluded Kanpur Test. There was an incident in Kanpur. There was a hearing by the match referee, Roshan Mahanama, during which Harbhajan apologised to Prince, Arthur told a website on Tuesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Klasnic battles odds to put Croatia through
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Klasnic battles odds to put Croatia through

	One of the least likely firsts took place in the Worthersee Stadium Monday night when Ivan Klasnic became the first kidney transplant patient to both play and score in the European Championship finals (as reported briefly in Tuesdays Late City edition). The strikers first-half goal gave Croatia, who face Turkey in Vienna in Fridays quarter-final, a 100 per cent record so far.         
	With their place in the last eight guaranteed, Croatia made nine changes from the team that beat Germany, with only Ivan Rakitic and Danijel Pranjic surviving. New Spurs midfielder Luka Modric started on the bench, after his booking in the 2-1 win last Thursday.         
	Coach Slaven Bilic included Werder Bremens Klasnic, who underwent a successful kidney transplant operation last year, and he soon impressed.         
	Poland, while needing a near-miracle to qualify, began brightly and when Wojciech Lobodzinski crossed from the right Jacek Krzynowek bravely attempted to beat goalkeeper Vedran Runje, but succeeded only in hurting himself.         
	Despite coach Leo Beenhakkers criticism of referee Howard Webb following the 1-1 draw with Austria, Poland again did little to suggest they deserved anything more than group elimination, and the second-half pattern was much as the first, with Croatias reserves in control.                   
	And the inevitable happened in the 52nd minute when Croatia took the lead, fittingly through Klasnic, whose commanding performance deserved a goal. It was simple yet effective, with the striker exchanging passes with Pranjic before cutting in from the left to find the far corner beyond Borucs outstretched arm.         
	Klasnic, who needed two kidneys  one from his mother and, after his body rejected it, another from his father  wears a fibre-glass shield as protection, but he was in danger of getting injured when he was mobbed by teammates.

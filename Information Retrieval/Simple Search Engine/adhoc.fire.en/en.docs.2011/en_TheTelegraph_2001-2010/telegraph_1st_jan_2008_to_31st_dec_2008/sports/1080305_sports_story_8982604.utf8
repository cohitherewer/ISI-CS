                                                   Bagan bank on trusted duo
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After storming into the 113th IFA Shield semi-finals, city giants Mohun Bagan have got themselves in contention for the century old title.         
	The boys are playing brilliantly. If they maintain this momentum they will surely become the champions, coach Carlos Roberto Pereira said after Tuesdays training session.         
	The Bagan coach said he had little knowledge of his opponents, Santos FC. Arent they a second-string team? Pereira asked.         
	I have heard that the goalkeeper is tall and the team has good strikers... But I feel we will enjoy an upper hand. We will have the home advantage and the way Barreto and Bhaichung are playing we hardly need to be anxious about anything, Pereira said.

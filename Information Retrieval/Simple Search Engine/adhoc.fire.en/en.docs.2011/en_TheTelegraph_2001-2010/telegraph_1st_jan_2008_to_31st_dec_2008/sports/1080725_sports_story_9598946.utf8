	Romanias Nadia Comaneci was the indisputable star of the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, becoming the first ever gymnast to be awarded a perfect score of 10.         
	During her routine on the uneven bars the first score to appear on the scoreboard was, strangely, a 1.00, leaving the public baffled. In fact, the screen had malfunctioned since it had not been programmed to display a perfect score. In total, Comaneci received seven 10 scores in her events during her Canadian stay.         
	Subsequently millions of television viewers watched in awe as the 14-year-old (1.55m/40kg) sensation won the all-around competition as well as the asymmetric bars and the balance beam in brilliant style. In 1980 a physically transformed Comaneci arrived in Moscow to defend her titles at a relatively mature and adult age.         
	But having lost some of her dynamism and having to contend with partisan judges, the 18-year-old was not so dominant in the Russian capital.         
	She left Moscow with golds in the floor and the balance beam, and a silver in the all-around competition.         
	She settled in the United States, performing in gymnastics events across the country. In 1996 she married the American parallel bar and team Olympic champion (1984) Bart Conner.

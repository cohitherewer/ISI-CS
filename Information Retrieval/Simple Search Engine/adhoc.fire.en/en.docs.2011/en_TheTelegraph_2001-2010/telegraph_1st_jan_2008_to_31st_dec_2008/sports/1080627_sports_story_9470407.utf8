                                                                                                                                                                                                       5 flashes of pure entertainment
  - Domenech gave a good laugh with his pronouncements       ALAN SMITH               Wesley Sneijder scores past Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon during their group C match on June 9                                 
	With the Euro 2008 well into its final stages, it would perhaps not be out of place to recollect some of its more enduring moments so far:         
	Monday, June 9: Wesley Sneijders goal against Italy         
	Holland might be out, but Berne wont forget this night of Total Football. At the heart of the action stood Wesley Sneijder, who finished off a move of outstanding beauty.         
	With the Dutch defending a corner, Giovanni van Bronckhorst cleared off the line before sprinting forward on the counter-attack. Having found room on the left flank, he swept a diagonal pass on to the head of Dirk Kuyt, who had pulled away at the far post. Kuyts cushioned header was perfect, landing right on the toes of the on-rushing Sneijder. With Gianluigi Buffon coming at him quickly, the goalkeeper spreading himself like a star, the Real Madrid playmakers volley somehow squeezed in at the near post. Extraordinary!         
	Friday, June 13: Gianluigi Buffons penalty save against Romania         
	With nine minutes left in this second group game, the referee pointed to the penalty spot when Christian Panucci appeared to drag down Daniel Niculae.         
	At that point, Adrian Mutu could have nudged his country towards the quarter finals and at the same time, condemned the Azzurri to likely elimination.         
	Instead, the worlds most expensive goalkeeper confirmed his class yet again. Diving to his left, Buffon reached back to get his hand to Mutus drive. Yes, he got a slice of luck when the ball ricocheted off his boot, but he deserved that break for the original save.         
	Sunday, June 15: Nihats second goal against the Czech Republic         
	It seems that Turkey were incapable of rousing themselves until the only alternative is a flight back to Istanbul. How else to explain all the heroic comebacks? First against Switzerland, then the Czech Republic and most recently Croatia, who couldnt recover from Semi Senturks equaliser. But that sensational, last-gasp strike wouldnt have been possible if Nihat Kahveci had not overturned a Czech two-goal lead with his quick fire brace.         
	Having only just pounced on Petr Cechs fumble, Nihat was overflowing with confidence when Hamit Altintop released his captain with a measured pass. One-on-one with Cech, the Villarreal striker clipped an unstoppable effort off the underside of the bar.         
	Raymond Domenechs bizarre behaviour         
	Few would have been too amused back in France, but Domenech gave the rest of us a good laugh with his baffling pronouncements. There was the coachs heavy reliance on astrology to pair a Leo with a Sagittarius in central defence.         
	Adding to the embarrassment, this maverick proposed to his girlfriend live on television only seconds after France had been dumped out.         
	The country of love or not, you can imagine what his compatriots thought of such timing.         
	Saturday, June 21: Russias magnificent display against Holland         
	An amazing performance from Russia in Basel. The prodigious level of fitness took the breath away, as did the fearless belief on such a big occasion. Andrei Arshavin will receive most of the attention, but there was so much more to admire in this excellent group  the two steely full-backs, the unbelievable energy of right midfielder Ivan Saenko and Roman Pavlyuchenkos emergence as a thrusting centre-forward.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

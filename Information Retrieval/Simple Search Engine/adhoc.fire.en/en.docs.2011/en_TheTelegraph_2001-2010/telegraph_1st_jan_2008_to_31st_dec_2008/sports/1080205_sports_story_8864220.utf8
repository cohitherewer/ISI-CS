                                                     Fire or retire: Indias new mantra

   
	Brisbane: Determined not to cut down on aggression towards the Australians, the Indian one-day squad has devised a theme to mirror its philosophy for the weeks ahead.
 
	Fire or retire is the latest Team India mantra for the one-day tri-series.
 
	The theme of fire or retire apparently exhorts the team members to come down hard on Australia, meet fire with fire, and in case they are not able to do it, fall back and support the other guy doing it.
 
	Three Os was the theme during the Test series and when expanded to full, it meant one on one.

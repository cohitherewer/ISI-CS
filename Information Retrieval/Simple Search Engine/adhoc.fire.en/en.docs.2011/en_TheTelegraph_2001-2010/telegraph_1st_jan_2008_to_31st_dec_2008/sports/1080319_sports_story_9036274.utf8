The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Outstanding match: Aloke
                                                   Outstanding match: Aloke
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Edmilson vies with an Ahli Sana'a defender during the AFC Cup group B match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture		    
	Calcutta: For Aloke Mukherjee, visibly relieved after winning his first match as East Bengal coach, Tuesdays result couldnt have come at a better time.         
	It took me 20 days and five matches but in the end I managed to bring the boys together I havent let Mana-da (Manoranjan Bhattacharya) down, said Mukherjee.         
	The East Bengal interim coach was clear on what made the difference on Tuesday.         
	Not even our greatest of critics can accuse us of playing poorly all through. We thoroughly deserved to win in Gurgaon (versus Dempo in Super Cup).         
	But its impossible to turn out victorious if four-five sitters go abegging Today we converted a half chance. That made all the difference.         
	Could this be a turning point for East Bengal? The coach seemed quite cautious, bordering on apologetic.         
	Its just one win. There is still a long, long way to go We had an outstanding match but things could quickly change.         
	Mukherjee praised the Herculean effort dished out by Edmilson. He was reluctant to turn up, having had a shot just before the match. I asked him to go all out. Not only did he play for 90 minutes, he took an enormous amount of load.         
	The Yemeni defenders failed to keep pace with him and that opened up a lot of areas for us to exploit.         
	Mukherjee didnt buy the argument that Ahli Sanaa players suffered from the heat.         
	So? What happens when we are made to play in biting cold? As professionals, you are expected to adapt to the conditions Fact is, they didnt seem as good a team as Safa FC.         
	The Yemeni coach, expectedly, blamed the heat and lack of freshness for the defeat. We are not used to playing in such conditions. It was not even a 5pm start. Besides, we missed our main striker (Al Nono) and the players were jet-lagged.         
	It wasnt a fair result. We hope to turn things around when we host them in Yemen.         
	But the loss seemed to have given him a better idea of Indian football. East Bengal are a good side. They never let up. They always came hard at us, the Sanaa coach said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ban leaves family stunned
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chandigarh: Harbhajan Singhs family, shocked by the 11-match ban on the off-spinner for slapping Sreesanth in Jalandhar, shut themselves out of the media on Monday.         
	Harbhajans mother Avtar Kaur, who had been praying for a lesser punishment for her son since that incident on Friday, preferred to stay away from the hordes of reporters, who thronged to the house once the inquiry under Farokh Engineer got underway in New Delhi.         
	She is feeling very sad at the turn of events. We are all shocked by the ban. We had thought the issue would be amicably settled with Sreesanth and only an apology would have solved the problem. But the ban has come as a shock to her and also us, Sandeep, who claimed to be Harbhajans niece, remarked on the phone from the house.         
	According to Sandeep, Avtar was waiting for her sons call from Delhi, which had not come till 7pm. We dont know whether he will come back home or travel to Mumbai with the team. But she wants him to return to Jalandhar and spend some time with the family, Sandeep added.         
	Asked whether the family had expected extension of the ban to cover some Tests and ODIs also, Sandeep said the family was unaware of such a development. He has suffered enough, she said with a sigh.         
	Avtar had earlier said she was pained at what she had been watching and hearing on television on her sons altercation with Sreesanth.         
	The slapping incident happened on Friday, minutes after the Mumbai team captained by Harbhajan lost to Kings XI. Television cameras showed Sreesanth sobbing and being consoled by teammates.         
	I spoke to Harbhajan and asked him to come clean on the matter. He told me that the issue had been blown out of proportion by the media and both he and Sreesanth continued to remain good friends, Avtar had said over the phone from Jalandhar.         
	I only know what my son has told me and what I have been watching on television, she remarked, adding the incident had troubled her immensely.

  - I was misquoted on retirement, says Rajasthan Royals captain       A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly at the Eden on Tuesday. Picture by Pabitra Das                                   
	Calcutta: After knocking out the hosts with surgical precision in front of their home crowd, satisfaction was writ large on the face of Rajasthan Royals captain-cum-coach Shane Warne. In the post-match news conference, he talked at length on the tactical adjustments that the team had made ahead of facing a very good bowling side in Kolkata Knight Riders and said one of their objectives before this match was to send a message to their nearest rivals.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Knocking out the Kolkata Knight Riders         
	Its always nice to knock a side out of the competition. I asked my boys before this match whether they knew the importance of throwing out the Knight Riders and they said they were eager to do just that. We also wanted to send a strong message to our nearest competitors that we are not going to take our foot off the pedal. We caught them on the hop a little bit today. Had they scored around 160 it wouldve been a very close call. They have got good bowlers. Umar Gul is one of the top performers in the competition. We had planned our innings accordingly. We had tar-geted Sourav Gangulys overs and thats why sent Yousuf Pathan lower down the order. Mohammed Kaif also showed his class.         
	Did the hosts lose out in the first 10 overs?         
	Yeah... The first six overs were pretty crucial. Munaf Patel got a maiden wicket. He has been fantastic. I initially found him shy. He has been expressing himself now. He can walk into the Indian side any day. We are going to play three games in five days.. Thats obviously tough... But we have showed our character.         
	Sohail Tanvir one down?         
	We needed one or two good overs at that stage. I am thankful to Jeremy Snape and Berry for that suggestion. They have really made a big difference.         
	On approaching the next two games         
	Its going to be a very good opportunity for our younger guys. But we are a little disappointed that we wont get a home match even if we reach the final. I think the top two sides in the competition should have been given the opportunity to play before the home crowd. Mumbai Indians, if they reach the title round, will play at home. In fact, I wouldnt have minded playing at the Eden, before 1,00,000-odd people.         
	What was the planning when four wickets were down?         
	We still had Yousuf, Kaif and couple of other very good performers left. The strength of our squad is that everybody performs. We have no superstars.         
	On his comeback bid         
	Look mate, I am very happily retired and want to spend the time with my children and working for my charity foundation. I was mis-quoted the other day. I said if Stuart MacGill broke his leg and every other spinner in Australia had virus, then I would consider coming back!         
	Game against Mumbai Indians         
	We are not thinking too far ahead. Mumbai are obviously a very good side. They have the dangerous Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya. But we are taking one match at a time.         
	Personal equation with Sourav Ganguly         
	I am friends with Sourav. I respect him.

                                                   Klinsmann in new role

           
	Berlin: Juergen Klinsmann will take over as coach of Bayern Munich from next season, the Bundesliga club announced on Friday. 
    
	Former Germany coach will take over the running of the club from July 1, Bayern said in a statement. 
    
	Klinsmann guided the German national team to third place at the 2006 World Cup before resigning immediately after the tournament. He has not held a coaching position since. 
    
	Bayerns current coach Ottmar Hitzfeld had already announced his decision to step down at the end of the season. 
    
	Klinsmann, 43, is well known to Bayern fans from his playing days. During a successful career, Klinsmann played for Bayern from 1995 to 1997 and helped the team win the Uefa Cup and the German league title during his two years there. 
    
	Bayern feel they need the Klinsmann treatment after an rebuilding job last season failed to win over all the fans.

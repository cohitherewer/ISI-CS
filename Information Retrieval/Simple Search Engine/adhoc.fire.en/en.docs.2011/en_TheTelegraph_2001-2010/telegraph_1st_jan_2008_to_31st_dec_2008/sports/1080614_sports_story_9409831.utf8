The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India battle to tide over injuries
                                                                                                                                                                                                       India battle to tide over injuries
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Rennedy Singh is racing against time to be fit                           
	Srinagar: Winning the Saff Cup had never been much of a problem for India in the past. Out of the six editions played since 1993, India had won four.         
	But on Saturday, at the Sugathadasa Stadium in Colombo, India must use all their experience to retain the title in the final against Maldives.         
	India are a highly depleted side. On Saturday, they are certain to miss at least two of their regular players  defender NS Manju and midfielder Steven Dias  who suffered injuries during the course of the tournament.         
	To make matters worse, the management is unsure whether two other midfielders  Rennedy Singh and Climax Lawrence  would be able to make it on Saturday. Both pulled their hamstrings in the last match against Bhutan.         
	With the list of casualties getting longer, the Indians are now blaming the format. Coach Bob Houghton has already said that playing four matches in eight days is too taxing.         
	During the Maldives leg of the meet, the scheduling was poor, he said. While Maldives played all their ties under floodlights, India were made to play in the afternoon.         
	India had beaten Maldives in an inconsequential group match at Male, but it would be a different ball game on Saturday.         
	The return of Samir Naik in defence could be seen as the only silver lining. Naik, who missed the semi-final because of double booking, will replace Anwar. While Dipak Mondal and Naik will be the wing-backs, Mahesh Gawli will pair up with Gourmangi Singh as central defenders.         
	Midfield could be Indias biggest problem. If Lawrence plays, Bungo Singh and Manjit Singh will play on the right and the left, respectively.

	Mildred Babe Didriksons eclectic love for sport was legendary. Having become double Olympic champion in 1932 and the first real female star of the Games, she was widely regarded as Americas most prominent sportswoman for the first half of the century.         
	Didrikson, the daughter of a Norwegian carpenter who had emigrated to the US, was physically adept at most sports. However, it was athletics that most attracted her attention.         
	At the 1932 Games in Los Angeles, Didrikson shone, winning gold in the 80m hurdles and beating the world record in the process (11.7s). She also won the javelin gold and tied for the high jump title with compatriot Jean Shiley (1.65m) before being relegated to 2nd place. Judges claimed she jumped head-first.         
	Naturally gifted, and curious, Didrikson excelled in many other sports, including baseball, basketball and billiards, evoking admiration nation-wide. However, it was after marrying the heavyweight (150kg) wrestler, George Zaharias, that she discovered golf. In true Didrikson style, she also excelled on the fairways.         
	In 1940 she won her first golf tournament, before going on to become the best female player in the United States. Her major tournament wins were the US Open (3 times), the last of which she won in 1954, two years before being stricken with cancer at the age of 43.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roddick shock for Federer
                                                   Roddick shock for Federer
                      
	Miami: Andy Roddick upset world No. 1 Roger Federer 7-6, 4-6, 6-3 at the Sony Ericsson Open quarter-final on Thursday.         
	It was only Roddicks second win in 17 career meetings against the Swiss, his last success coming in Montreal five years ago.         
	He hasnt missed a ball against me for about six years, Roddick told reporters. I figured the law of statistics had to work for me eventually.         
	I think I did well to hang in there, said Federer. Maybe this is one of the matches I should have won against him because hes had some other ones where I think he was supposed to win. This time around it went his way.         
	Despite not forcing a break point until the eighth game of the third set, it was enough for Roddick, who broke to love when Federer dumped a forehand into the net.         
	The big-hitting American wrapped up victory on his third match point with a sizzling service winner.         
	Twelve-times Grand Slam winner Federer has yet to reach a final this year.         
	Roddick will play world No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko in the semi-finals after the Russians emphatic 6-2, 6-1 win over Serbian Janko Tipsarevic.         
	In the womens semi-final, Serena Williams beat world No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetsova 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 to reach final on Thursday.         
	Williams will play world No. 3 Jelena Jankovic in Saturdays final after the Serbian overpowered Russias Vera Zvonareva 6-1, 6-4 in the other semi-final. (REUTERS)

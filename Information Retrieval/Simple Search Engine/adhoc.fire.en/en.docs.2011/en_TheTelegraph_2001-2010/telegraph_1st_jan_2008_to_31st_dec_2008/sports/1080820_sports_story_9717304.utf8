Why divers are fond of showers | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)

	Beijing: Forget human rights, air pollution and Liu Xiangs stunning injury. One of the most heated water-cooler debates of this Olympic Games has been about showers and why divers seem obsessed with them.         
	With few exceptions, a divers routine goes something like this: Climb to the platform. Dry off. Dive. Get out of the pool. Then, just as their scores are being announced over the public-address system, the divers head to a bank of showers a few feet away. The cameras capture every detail as they dunk their heads in the hot water and appear to lather off, even though they do not use soap.         
	Ive always wondered why they shower, Neta Ecker, a 36-year-old from Haifa, Israel, said as she and her daughter headed into the Water Cube to watch the semi finals of the womens three-meter springboard Saturday night. But it looks like theyre having fun.         
	The answer is actually simple. The pool is 79 degrees, and when the divers come out, they are cold. Since there is often a long wait between dives, they shower to keep their muscles warm.         
	The showers are very hot, and it keeps your body warm, said Arturo Miranda, a Canadian diver. You want to be able to keep your body temperature very high, so your muscles are ready to go.         
	It becomes a habit, said Kristin Wingfield, a former competitive diver from Canada who is now a sports-medicine doctor in San Francisco. You run into the shower to keep your muscles warm.         
	That rationale received approval from Bengt Saltin, a professor of human physiology at Copenhagen University who is a leading expert on how muscles work. Muscles should be around 104 degrees to perform at their peak, he said. Passive heating is one way of having warm muscles when you start your performance, he said.         
	Several divers acknowledged, however, that the showers serve a secondary purpose. Its really just a mental thing, said Chris Culwill, an American diver. I think I would dive just the same if I didnt take a shower. It just comforts me to be warm and relaxed.         
	Showering is just one quirk that mystifies spectators. Another is the shammies that divers use to dry themselves off, often until the final moments before they plunge into the pool. The shammies come in a variety of colors, and tie-dying them is popular.         
	Like the showers, the shammies serve a practical purpose. Divers skin must be perfectly dry so they do not lose their grip when they do complicated dives. Kenny Armstrong, a US diving coach, noted that the American Matt Scoggin lost his grip in Barcelona in 1992 while performing a back three-and-a-half somersault and landed flat on his back in the finals. Theres nothing worse than slippery, Armstrong said.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

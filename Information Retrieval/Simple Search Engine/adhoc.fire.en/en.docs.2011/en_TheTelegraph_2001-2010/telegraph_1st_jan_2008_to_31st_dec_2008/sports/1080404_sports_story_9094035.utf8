The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji: Need to draw lesson from Eden Test vs Aussies
                                                     Bhajji: Need to draw lesson from Eden Test vs Aussies
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            AB de Villiers after reaching his fifty in Ahmedabad on Thursday                           
	Ahmedabad: Harbhajan Singh has urged his teammates to draw inspiration from the famous Eden Test against Steve Waughs men seven years ago after India were dismissed for 76 by South Africa in Motera on Thursday. Harbhajan, then, had claimed a hattrick and V.V.S. Laxman hit a majestic 281 to stop the Aussie sides winning juggernaut at the Eden.         
	We were in a similar situation in Calcutta against Australia and we not only saved that match, but won it. We need to do the same here need to show the same kind of application in the second innings, the off-spinner, who took three for 49 on Thursday, told a news conference.               
	The following are excerpts         
	How would you describe the day?         
	It was one of the worst days in my 10 years (of international cricket). I cant really say what went wrong In fact, everything went wrong Anyway, whatever has happened has happened and we now need to look ahead with a positive frame of mind         
	Were you surprised by the nature of the pitch? Was it against the think tanks wish?         
	When we played last time (against Sri Lanka in December 2005), it was a red soil. Now things have changed and it is changing everywhere in India (vis-a-vis wickets), much to our disadvantage. I think, as the home team, we should play to our strength, which is spin. Most of our victories in India have been achieved through spin bowling Earlier, we used to have results on a regular basis but now we are getting too many draws. But at the end of the day, you have play on whatever wicket you are given.         
	Strategy on Day II         
	We have to get them out as quickly as possible, maybe by lunch time. The wickets of (Jacques) Kallis and AB de Villiers are crucial because their dismissals will leave their tail exposed Even in Chennai, we got the tail out in quick time (in the first innings).         
	Who is to blame, the pitch or the batsmen?         
	Obviously, we need to take the blame. We did not apply ourselves and played some casual shots Even I take the blame in that I should have scored some runs You cant really keep on complaining about the wicket. Hopefully, we will play a different sort of game on this pitch and show more application. We cant just go on and swing our bats all the time.         
	What was the teams strategy going into the match?         
	It was a green-top but at the same time it was also a good one to bat on. Probably we should have been careful the first half an hour and things would have eased out. Thats it. Its just a bad dream. We were in a similar situation in Calcutta against Australia (in 2001) and we not only saved that match but won it. We need to do the same here need to show the same kind of application in the second innings.         
	What will be your role here, keeping in mind the hattrick he got in that match at the Eden?         
	Yeah a big responsibility on my shoulders. Every bowler has to do his job. Its not easy but we will give it a try.         
	Chances of saving the match         
	Of course, we are hopeful We have to play good cricket and we are positive about it.         
	Any debate over Pathans inclusion in the match?         
	We were very sure about what sort of combination was needed here. Theres no debate over who was included and who sat out. We just wanted to go in with five bowlers and that was that.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Subrata Bhattacharjee did not face the threat of relegation very often during his playing days but as the coach of United SC, he is dealing with that pressure as his team takes on Mumbai FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday.         
	Talking to reporters on Thursday, Subrata said: There is not much difference between the teams. Well look for full points.         
	David Booth, the Mumbai FC coach, is also hoping for a good show. The fight for three points would continue.

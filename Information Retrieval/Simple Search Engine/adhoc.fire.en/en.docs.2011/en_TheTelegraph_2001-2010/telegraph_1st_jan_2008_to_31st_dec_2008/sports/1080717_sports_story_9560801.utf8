The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif requests for B sample test
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Asif requests for B sample test
                  Asif                     
	Karachi: Pakistans disgraced pace bowler Mohammed Asif on Wednesday sent a request to the Indian Premier League (IPL) officials to have his B sample tested.         
	His lawyer Shahid Karim confirmed that an email had been sent to the IPL organising committee asking for the B sample test.         
	This is Asifs right to ask for the second test and we remain confident it will reveal that the first test which has come positive might have been due to some mistake, Karim said.         
	Asif was the only player to test positive during the IPL where the random dope tests were conducted as per World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) rules.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday suspended Asif for an indefinite period.         
	Karim said the bowler had so far not got anything in writing about his suspension from the board and exuded confidence of wiping out the blot on Asifs reputation.         
	But we are confident because Asif is certain he is innocent of doping charges. We hope the B sample test is held as soon as possible so that his name is cleared, he stated.         
	Meanwhile, with the PCB realising the futility and possible consequences of assisting Asif, the disgraced pacer might find himself all alone in his quest to clear his name.         
	Sources in the board said that the scenario for Asif was not very bright after he was named as the player who had tested positive during the recent IPL.         
	The truth is that privately some officials in the board believe that it might be the end of the road for Asif as there are slim chances of his B sample test coming negative, one source said.         
	The information about the case and the preliminary test passed on to the board by the IPL organisers are not very good for Asif, the source added. (PTI)

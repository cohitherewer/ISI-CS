                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wild card for Sania, Sunitha
                  Sania Mirza                     
	New Delhi: Indias Sania Mirza and Sunitha Rao have been given a wild card for womens doubles competition of the Olympics to be held in Beijing from August 8-24.         
	While Sania is Indias No. 1, US-based Sunitha is second-highest ranked Indian in the WTA charts and has represented the country in the Fed Cup.         
	A senior official at the All India Tennis Association (AITA) said they have received the official confirmation from the International Tennis Federation (ITF). We got a letter from the ITF yesterday (Wednesday), saying Sania and Sunitha, who were AITA nominations, have been approved a wild-card entry to the womens doubles competition, the official said.         
	Sania has already been given direct entry into the singles competition.         
	Meanwhile, Sunitha shrugged off a poor start to beat Kristina Kuvoca of Slovakia in a tough three-setter to advance to the singles second round of the ITF womens event in Boston.         
	The US based Indian, seeded fifth, rallied to beat her Slovakian opponent 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) in the first round. (PTI)

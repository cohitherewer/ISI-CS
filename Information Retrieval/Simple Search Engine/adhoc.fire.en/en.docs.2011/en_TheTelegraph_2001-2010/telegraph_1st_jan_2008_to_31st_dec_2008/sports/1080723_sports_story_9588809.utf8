The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Age is an issue only in India, says Sourav Ganguly
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Age is an issue only in India, says Sourav Ganguly
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Former Team India captain gets candid         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                          
	Colombo: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly spoke to The Telegraph for around half-an-hour (at the Taj Samudra) in the lead-up to the first Test, which gets under way here on Wednesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q You were the MoM in the last Test we played (versus South Africa, in Kanpur)... That must be a source of strength in the lead-up to the newest series...         
	A Yes, but not just that Test against South Africa... I draw strength from my performances in Test cricket since my comeback at the Wanderers in December 2006 (1,571 runs at an average of 50-plus). Hopefully, I can carry on in the same manner.         
	Q Having been away from international cricket for some months (not getting to play a role in the tri-series in Bangladesh and the Asia Cup in Pakistan), its a comeback of sorts for you in the Team India environment. Does it take time to adjust?         
	Its not a comeback of sorts... I dont see it that way... But, yes, Ive not been a part of the one-day team this year... Thats the reality.         
	Q At 36, you havent lost the hunger for ODIs         
	Look, today, Im focused on Test cricket... Ive stopped thinking about the one-day game... People keep asking me about it and I dont want to harp on what Ive been saying... Age is an issue only in India... Look at Sanath Jayasuriya, who is 39 and still an integral part of Sri Lankas one-day team... Muttiah Muralidharan is 36... Matthew Hayden, too, is going strong at the age of 36.         
	Q If youve stopped thinking about one-day cricket, why dont you announce retirement from that form? Youve already had a great run, isnt it?         
	At this stage, I dont think it really matters whether I quit or dont quit... Bottomline is that Im not part of the one-day team and that Ive got to focus on the job at hand (the three-Test series)...         
	Q What drives you?         
	Well, 36 is no age to hang up ones boots... There are quite a few 35-plus cricketers around... They are an inspiration... However, nothing inspires me more than my own performances.         
	Q To talk of the job at hand, is one practice game enough before the start of a Test series?         
	You cant do anything about it... Thats the way tours are structured nowadays... Irrespective of which team is touring where, two practice games would be a luxury. Of course, if youre playing both forms (Tests and ODIs) then youre more in touch with cricket.         
	Q Youve been touring Sri Lanka since 1996. Whats your take on the way cricket has evolved in these parts?         
	At home, the Sri Lankans are always dangerous... They beat India in the Asia Cup final earlier this month and while that was a one-day tournament, theyll still be very high on confidence.         
	Our last full tour was in 2001-02, when you were the captain. Any special memories?         
	The Kandy Test win... I got the MoM award then... We didnt win the one-day tournament (a tri-series) and didnt win the Test series either... Having said that, I didnt have so many of the regulars... Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, Jawagal Srinath (was available only at the start of the Test series), V.V.S.Laxman... I just didnt have the experience to bank on and the pressure on Rahul Dravid and on myself was immense.         
	Do wickets in Sri Lanka test a batsmans patience?         
	Well, if theres a ball to be hit, it should be hit.         
	Q Has too much been made of Ajantha Mendis?         
	This kind of hype can happen... Dont forget he single-handedly won the Asia Cup final for Sri Lanka... But the batters are going to work on ways to neutralise him... The more they see of him, the better theyll play him.         
	Q Whats the kind of work you all have been putting in?         
	Weve been studying his action... Its important to pick him at the time of release... You cant wait for the ball to pitch and turn.         
	Q You faced Ajantha at the Knight Riders nets. What did you make of him?         
	Bowling at nets isnt quite the same as bowling for your country... Obviously, one could make out hes talented.         
	Q Wasim Akram has gone on record to say that Ajantha is the most gifted bowler he has seen. Would you, too, go that far?         
	Murali is definitely more gifted.         
	Q Ajantha will be making his Test debut, but Sri Lankas is an ageing attack... Murali, Chaminda Vaas (who is 34)...         
	(Laughs) Havent I told you that age is a factor only in Indian cricket? Murali and Vaas arent young, yes, but both have been big performers... They are around because they perform... Their contribution is well known.         
	Q How do you fancy our chances in the Test series?         
	Very good, if we bat well... Weve got the bowlers to take 20 wickets in every Test...The Sri Lankans are strong at home, but we play the spinners very well. Runs on the board puts pressure on the opposition, no matter how good its record at home.         
	Q With Virender Sehwag getting the vice-captaincy, a new management structure is in place. Being a former captain, are you being consulted?         
	Everybody is being consulted.         
	Q To move away from Team India, has Andrew Flintoff been approached by the Knight Riders? Youre the captain...         
	No... Those reports have been incorrect... I understand hell only be available for a few days next year and, after the problems we faced in the first edition, we wouldnt like a repeat of players coming and leaving for national duty after just a few matches. Doesnt help.         
	Q Finally, are you, in a small manner at least, also thinking about the CAB elections back in Calcutta?         
	Dont want to talk about it.

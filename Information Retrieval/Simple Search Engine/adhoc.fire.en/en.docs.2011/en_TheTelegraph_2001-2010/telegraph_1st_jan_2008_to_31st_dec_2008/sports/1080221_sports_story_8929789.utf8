The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AS Roma put it past Real Madrid
                                                   AS Roma put it past Real Madrid
                      
	Rome: David Pizarro and Mancini scored as AS Roma came from behind to take charge of their Champions League last 16 tie against Real Madrid with a 2-1 first-leg win on Tuesday.         
	Schalke 04 played like veterans in their first appearance in the knockout rounds of the Champions League to beat Porto 1-0 and celebrate their 100th European match with a 50th victory.         
	Kevin Kuranyi blasted in the only goal in the fourth minute, after the Porto keeper Helton had failed to hold a shot from Rafinha.         
	Real went ahead with their first attack in the eighth minute when Raul diverted a Guti strike into the net after Arjen Robben had broke down the left and cut the ball back. Chilean midfielder Pizarro drilled Roma level in the 24th after Reals attempt to clear a Mancini cross landed at his feet.         
	Mancini slipped in the winner in the 58th minute when captain Francesco Totti found himself in space thanks to Gabriel Heinzes failed attempt to cut out a pass and was able to put the Brazilian winger through on goal.         
	After falling behind, Marco Cassetti tried to hit back for the home side immediately with a powerful strike from the edge of the box that Real keeper Iker Casillas did well to save.         
	Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy then had the ball in the back of the Roma net but his tap-in from a parried shot was disallowed for offside.         
	Van Nistelrooy had a shout for a penalty turned down and Raul headed a good chance wide shortly before Pizarros equaliser.         
	Both sides looked more cautious after conceding early on and the rest of the first half was short of goalmouth action.         
	Roma make a bright start after the break and French midfielder Ludovic Giuly threw off his marker in the area with some neat footwork only to hoof his shot high and wide.         
	Sergio Ramos came close to restoring parity after Mancinis goal with a long-distance strike that went narrowly wide.         
	Roma survived another scare when keeper Doni fumbled a shot in front of van Nistelrooy, but defender Juan cleared before the Dutchman could pounce.         
	The Romans then wasted a great opportunity for a third when they had the Real defence outnumbered four to two, before van Nistelrooy thumped the ball against the post 10 minutes from time.         
	It is the first time in four games that the Spanish champions have failed to beat Roma at the Stadio Olimpico.         
	In the other match, Porto, who won the European Cup for the second time on their last visit to the Arena AufSchalke in 2004, created little before Lisandro Lopez almost grabbed an equaliser from nowhere with a close-range effort that flew wide 10 minutes from time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal tied at 45th spot
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal tied at 45th spot
                      
	Wichita: Arjun Atwal brought home a card of three-under 68 and was tied for the 45th spot when darkness suspended play in the opening round of the Preferred Health Systems Wichita Open on the nation-wide tour here.         
	Atwal sank in four birdies against a bogey in his opening round.         
	Despite the near-flawless performance, Atwals position on the leader-board was relatively low as several golfers were yet to complete their rounds.         
	The Orlando-based pro is, otherwise, just six strokes adrift of leader American Tommy Tolles.         
	Atwal parred six holes on a stretch and also picked up a birdie on the eighth on his front nine.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Karl puts Diego before Pele
    - German legend rates 1986 World Cup final vs Argentina the best moment of his career             A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta: Diego Armando Maradona was his greatest on-field rival, but former German captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Wednesday voted for the Argentine great as the real best player over Pele. Rummenigge, who is currently the chairman of FC Bayern Munich, was candid while talking to a group of journalists at a city hotel on Thursday, after announcing plans for the proposed Bengal Techno Bayern Munich Academy in Burdwan.         
	To tell the truth, I always was in favour of Maradona rather than Pele Both have been fantastic players But I believe Maradona played at a time when things were a bit more difficult Pele played just in Brazil and towards the end of his career in New York for Cosmos But Maradona played in Argentina for Boca Juniors and moved to Barcelona then to Naples So I feel Maradona is the real best footballer ever seen, the German legend said.         
	Asked whether he would invite Maradona during the inauguration of the academy he said: Last week, I met Maradona in Munich and had a nice chat. I wish him the best as the Argentina coach. If possible, he can be invited for the inauguration.         
	He feels Argentinas chances of qualifying for the South Africa World Cup have brightened after Maradona took over as coach. Under Maradona, I believe they will qualify for the World Cup in South Africa Argentina are in a very uncomfortable situation and he (Maradona) is trying to bring back the old spirit, he said.         
	Asked what would be Germanys perfect build-up to the World Cup in 2010, the 53-year old said that winning a major title would definitely serve as a big boost. He also mentioned that this would be the current crop of players last chance to win a major title since a new set will take over after the World Cup.         
	We have always done well in tournaments like World Cup and European tournaments And so it is time we win an important title because the Euro 1996 was our last major win he said.         
	Rummenigge mentioned the 1986 World Cup final against Argentina in Mexico as the best moment of his career.         
	In my career I won everything except unfortunately the World Cup But the most memorable moment was the final against Argentina in Mexico. It was a fantastic experience and I will never forget that. I went to the stadium two hours prior to the match and it was a full house The mix of all colours from around the world was a great scene Such a huge gathering was simply a fantastic experience, he said.         
	In the final, Argentina were 2-0 up, but West Germany staged a spirited comeback riding on Rummenigge and Rudi Vllers equalisers. But Jose Burruchaga scored the winner denying the Germans the world title. Maradona won the Golden Ball after adjudged the best player of the tournament.         
	Praising foreigners for Bayern Munichs performance in the last couple of seasons, Rummenigge said the trend was a good practice in Europe.         
	Its in practice all around Europe. Look at the English, Italian, Spanish clubs  Foreigners are doing well there also And in normal circumstances in our team (Bayern Muinch) we have five or six foreigners and we are proud of them They are all world class players and without their quality we couldnt achieve the success we have got in the past couple of years, Rummenigge said.         
	He however, stressed that the games richness depends on individual skill rather than tactics. First of all I dont believe that it was tactics that won us matches The difference is always made by the players. For example in 1986, thanks to Maradonas fantastic performance Argentina won the World Cup. These days tactics is important in football, but I still believe that individual quality is more important. That makes the difference on the pitch, he signed off.

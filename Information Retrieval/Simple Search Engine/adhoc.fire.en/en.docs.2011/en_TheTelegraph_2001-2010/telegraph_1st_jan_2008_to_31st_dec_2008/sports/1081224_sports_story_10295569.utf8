The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Singles star will emerge: Krishnan
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Singles star will emerge: Krishnan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The lack of a world-class Indian singles player does make legend Ramanathan Krishnan sad but he has not lost hope that some young player will fill up the void in the near future.         
	Talking to reporters at South Club on Tuesday, the former Davis Cup captain said: Right now, there is a vacuum. But I think some young player will come up.         
	Calcutta was the tennis capital for a long time. I took over the reins from Naresh Kumar as national champion and the capital shifted to Chennai. It remained that way till the late 1990s when Leander (Paes) took over from my son Ramesh. There hasnt been a world-class singles player since Leander, but you never know, someone may burst onto the scene suddenly, Krishnan said.         
	In the city to celebrate the 80th birthday of Kumar, who was his Davis Cup captain, Krishnan said his long-time friendship with Kumar forced him to come for his birthday.         
	Kumar, on the other hand, said: Although I was his captain, Ive learnt more things from him than he did from me. Hes not only the finest player the country has ever produced, hes also a very committed player.         
	Talking about the evolution of tennis, Krishnan said: The basic change in todays tennis is we were amateurs but todays game is not just professionalised but also commercialised. However, the rackets and shoes used nowadays have brought about a sea change in the way the game is played. Modern equipment enhances a players ability up to 30 per cent, which is a lot, Krishnan said.

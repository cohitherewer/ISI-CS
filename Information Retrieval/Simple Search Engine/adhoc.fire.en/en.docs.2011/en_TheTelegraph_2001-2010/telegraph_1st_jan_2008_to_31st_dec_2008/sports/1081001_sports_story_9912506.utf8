	Chennai: Captain Suresh Raina hit a strokeful 146 as India A set a tough target of 355 for New Zealand A on the penultimate day of their four-day match at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Tuesday.         
	India A, who took a slender 18-run first innings lead, were all out for 336 in 85 overs, 33 minutes after tea, leaving New Zealand the daunting task of battling out a minimum of 90 overs on Wednesday, the last day, to save the match.         
	In reply, the New Zealand were 41 for one. They need another 314 runs to win.

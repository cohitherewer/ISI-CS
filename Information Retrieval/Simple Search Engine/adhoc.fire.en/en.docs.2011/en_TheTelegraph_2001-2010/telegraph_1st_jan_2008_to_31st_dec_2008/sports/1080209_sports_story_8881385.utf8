	Aiming for a fifth successive title, Surya played a solid game against joint leader Bakre, who opted for the Ruy Lopez opening.         
	After exchanging queens on the 34th move when Surya was about to mop up the queenside pawns, Bakre resigned.

	In a Ruy Lopez game, the International Master from the host school, S P Sethuraman defeated Rahul Shetty of Indian Airlines in 58 moves.         
	Rahul had several combinations, leading to a draw, but missed them, only to lose.         
	Former national champion GM Pravin Thipsay was almost checkmated by Suvrajit Saha of Railways in 28 moves.           (PTI)

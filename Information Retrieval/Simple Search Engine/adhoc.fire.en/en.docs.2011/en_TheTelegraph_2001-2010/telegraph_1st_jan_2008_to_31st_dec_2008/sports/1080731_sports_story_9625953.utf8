The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Another spin test for India
                                                                                                                                                                                           Another spin test for India
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Galle: The Indians are likely to retain the same side, that got thrashed at the SSC, for the second Test beginning on Thursday.         
	The Indians will have to quickly find a solution to counter the twin threat posed by Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis.         
	Agencies add: Still licking the wounds of their humiliating defeat in the first Test in Colombo, the Indians got little time to regroup and work out a definite strategy to deal with the wily Muralidharan and Mendis.         
	Apart from the poor batting display, the Indian bowling and fielding also left much to be desired in Colombo, and it will need a vastly-improved performance from Anil Kumble and his men to keep themselves afloat in the three-match series.         
	The pressure, no doubt, will be on the batsmen who surrendered meekly to the spinners in the last game, which was quite surprising considering their experience and reputation of playing spin bowling.         
	For a batting line-up which boasts of seasoned batsmen like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S Laxman and Virender Sehwag, the collective failure in Colombo should serve as a big blow. It will be a real test of character for these top batsmen.         
	The Indians have also been toying with the idea of bringing in left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha at the expense of a batsman to strengthen the spin department.         
	Dinesh Karthik had a miserable time behind the wickets and as a batsman, but the team management may still persist with him for the crucial game in conditions which are bound to favour the home team.         
	The Sri Lankans have no major problems and will again be depending on Murali and Mendis to do bulk of the damage. The duo captured 19 of the 20 wickets in Colombo to script a resounding victory.         
	Curator Jayantha Waranaveera has already sounded the alarm bells by declaring that the pitch for the second Test will assist spinners from the third day.         
	This will be a spinners wicket because Lankans have got good spinners. Why should we not prepare the pitch for spinners when we have bowlers like Muralitharan and Mendis in our squad, Waranaveera said.         
	However, the curator insists that the track would assist the fast bowlers initially if they bowl with discipline. It will assist seamers initially. From the third day, it will start spinning. If Sri Lanka bat first then India could face defeat, he predicted.         
	In that case, the Indians may not want to bat in the fourth innings and for that to happen they will have to win the toss. It will be imperative for India that Sehwag and Gambhir give them a solid start.         
	Dravid, who has been struggling for form, will be under less pressure if the start is good and it could help him to settle down and play a long innings, while Tendulkar, Ganguly and Laxman can play their natural game.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S Laxman, Dinesh Karthik, Anil Kumble Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Zaheer Khan.         
	Sri Lanka (from): Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Michael Vandort, Malinda Warnapura, Kumar Sangakkara, Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Silva, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralidharan, Ajantha Mendis, Thilan Thushara, Nuwan Kulasekera, Chamara Kapugedera.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Venus, Serena in same half of draw
                                                   Venus, Serena in same half of draw
                      
	Bangalore: The Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, have been drawn in the same half of the WTA Bangalore Open which begins on Monday.         
	The multiple grand slam winners, who usually avoid playing in the same tournament outside the majors, have been given first round byes in their first Indian appearance.         
	I dont understand why they are playing in the same tournament, their father Richard Williams said on Sunday when quizzed about his daughters decision and a probable semi-final meeting.         
	Venus and Serena, ranked eighth and 10th in the world respectively, last figured together in a WTA tour event in Charleston last year but did not cross paths.         
	Their last on-court meeting was at the 2005 US Open which Venus won before bowing out in the quarter finals.         
	Top seed and Serbian world No. 4 Jelena Jankovic and fourth seeded Swiss Patty Schnyder have also got first round byes.         
	Indias world No. 32 Sania Mirza will skip her countrys biggest WTA event following her decision to boycott tournaments in India after being dragged into a series of controversies.         
	Pitting Sania against these top players with the crowd behind Sania would have inspired her to raise her game by several notches, tournament director Sunder Raju said.

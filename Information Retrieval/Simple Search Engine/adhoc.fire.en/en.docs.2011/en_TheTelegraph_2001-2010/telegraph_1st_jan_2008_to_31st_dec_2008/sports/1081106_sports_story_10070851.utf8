The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies hope to exploit Gambhir absence
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Aussies hope to exploit Gambhir absence
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Ricky Ponting in Nagpur                           
	Nagpur: Australia find themselves in a situation that they have seldom been in a Test series before. With their backs to the wall, trailing 0-1, the world champions need to win the fourth and final Test to retain the Gavaskar-Border Trophy. Yet, captain Ponting spoke with composure on the eve of the match.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q Your team has failed to take 20 wickets in the first three Tests. What combination you are looking at to get those 20 wickets in this match?         
	A We have the skills, I have full confidence in our bowlers to do what is required to win a Test match. Considering the wicket here, we are looking at playing Jason Krejza. Probably one of the fast bowlers or Cameron White (spinner) will have to make way, but we havent decided on the combination.         
	How much will Gautam Gambhirs absence help your team?         
	He has played well right from the start of the series. The openers have provided India with good starts but as he is not there, we have a bit of an opportunity to put pressure on the Indian middle order.         
	Do you think your team can take advantage of the distractions the Indian team has with regard to senior players?         
	A number of things are going through the Indians mind. But we know our job, which is to play better cricket. We had a positive end to the Delhi Test and we arelooking to hit the ground running tomorrow.         
	Are you concerned that there has been no match at the ground before?         
	Its just the way it is. It is not ideal to be playing on a wicket without having a first-class match played on it. It is pretty unusual for us, but it is the same for the Indians as well.         
	Your thoughts on Ganguly         
	Hes been a great servant of Indian cricket and has led well. I know he will enjoy his last few days in cricket. But I hope we can make it unendurable for him by winning .

	 City lad Sourav Kothari will participate in the Pontins International Open Snooker Series (PIOS) in Wales from June 23. The India No. 4, who will participate in the five-day long meet comprising eight events, sees this as a great opportunity. I feel this meet would help me raise my game by a few notches. This would also help me during the forthcoming IBSF World Billiards Championship, Kothari said. The top eight players after completion of all the eight ranking events will qualify for a place in the World Professional Snooker circuit.           
	 Ronit Dey continued his good run and scripted two new records in the State Sub-junior Aquatics Championship at the Subhas Sarobar on Sunday. In the 100m butterfly, Dey clocked 1.07.95 seconds and took 0.28.91 seconds in the 50 metre-freestyle to rewrite his own timings in both the categories. Kunal Basak notched up another record of the day clocking 1.14.83 seconds in the 100m freestyle.

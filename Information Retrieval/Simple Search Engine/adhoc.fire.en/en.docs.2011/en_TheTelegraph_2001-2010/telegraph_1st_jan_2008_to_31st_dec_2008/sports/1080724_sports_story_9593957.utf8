	History         
	The Olympic site was built on the spot where once stood the airport at which British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met Adolf Hitler to sign the Munich Accords in 1938.         
	Respect         
	The 400m gold and silver medallists Vincent Matthews and Wayne Collett of the US were given a hostile reception by the crowd as they adopted a lax attitude on the winners podium. While the star spangled banner played the two casually chatted to each other. The IOC and the US Olympic federation decided this was a serious enough offence to exclude them from taking part in any future Olympic events.         
	Brothers         
	In the freestyle wrestling event, Americans John and Ben Peterson both collected an impressive haul of medals over the course of two Olympics. At Munich, Ben became the light-heavyweight champion while John, his elder brother, was a silver medallist in the middleweight division. At Montreal however the brothers changed places. This time Ben won silver and John took the gold.         
	Shane Gold         
	The Australian swimming sensation Shane Gould was only 15 years old at the time of her medal haul (3 gold, 1 silver and 1 bronze).         
	Exploit         
	In the Munich pool Mark Spitz achieved the most unbelieveable series of victories, earning the Californian a timeless entry into the Olympic record books. In a matter of seven days, Spitz won seven gold medals while establishing seven world records in seven different events.         
	After relative failure in Mexico in 1968 (two titles in the relay, a silver and a bronze), Spitz threw himself into a four-year training regime designed to bring him guaranteed victory in Munich. Determined to avenge what he regarded as failure, Spitz subsequently arrived in Munich in top form and was unsure about which events to compete in  the crawl or the butterfly? Unable to decide, he went on to compete in all his favoured events. His main preoccupation was how to handle the various rounds and semi-finals, and the organisation of his time schedule.               
	Summary         
	Munich played host to the infamous 1972 Olympic Games where Palestinian guerillas kidnapped and murdered 11 members of the Israeli delegation.         
	The drama began on September 5th just six days before the end of the Games when eight members of the Black September group killed two Israelis and took another nine hostage at the Olympic village.         
	The competition was suspended and negotiations began.         
	After 11 hours of anguish, German authorities persuaded Black September to move to a military airport where a plane was to whisk them off to Cairo. However, the German police tried to storm the gang at the airport and a bloodbath ensued in which all the hostages, five of the terrorists, one policeman and a helicopter pilot were all killed.         
	The world was in shock but IOC president Avery Brundage declared famously the Games must go on and on they went, albeit under a dark cloud of mourning.         
	Before the globally televised horror show, the Games had produced some highly memorable sport although the events will be forever overshadowed.         
	Spitz pulled off a veritable gold heist with his seven wins, each one of them setting a world record. Spitzs phenomenal haul overshadowed 15-year-old Australian sensation Shane Gould. She might normally have expected to have been the star of the show after her wins in the 200m and 400m free-style and in the 200m medley.         
	The Soviets bagged the 100m and 200m sprints thanks to the efforts of Valery Borzov who crossed the 100m finish line with his arms aloft.         
	Finlands Lasse Viren won the 5000m and the 10000m and Kenyas Kip Keino was in action again winning the 3000m steeplechase.

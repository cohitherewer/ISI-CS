                                                     Dont take it lying down, Dhoni tells teammates
  - Australians are sledging all the time, says a Team India member       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Sydney: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has instructed its players not to retaliate when the Australians sledge, but ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is understood to have asked them not to take things lying down.         
	Hardly surprising, given the values Dhoni holds dear.         
	Dhonis position is clear  dont take anything lying down The Australians are sledging all the time, its just that they camouflage it very well on most occasions For example, theyll mutter something even while tapping the wicket and that wont get picked up You wont find them pointing to the dressing room and so on, a Team India member told The Telegraph on Thursday evening.         
	In fact, while the BCCI has made an impractical call, that sledging cease immediately, Dhoni has actually elevated it to an art form! Hes also acknowledged that his boys need to get better.         
	Clearly, theres no uniform stand and its obvious that the Australians are taking advantage.         
	Many here are wondering whether the decision to withdraw the charge (of abusing Test captain Anil Kumble and Test vice-captain Dhoni) against Brad Hogg, before last months Perth Test, has actually encouraged the Australians.         
	While that move probably helped Harbhajan Singh in his appeal against the racist slur, slapped by Mike Procter (Match Referee during the Test series), it sent a wrong message.         
	It was off the field, but the other day, Hayden went to the extent of calling Harbhajan an obnoxious little weed. Cricket Australia (CA) has reprimanded the senior pro, but the Indian camp is convinced he deserved a heavier punishment.         
	Harbhajan, though, declined to comment on the CA decision. Mujhe baat karne se mana kiya gaya hai, he insisted, when a reaction was sought at the Radisson Plaza.         
	Manager Dr Bimal Soni also chose not to comment. Why should anybody in the team react at all? It was a matter for CA and theyve dealt with it         
	Asked whether Match Referee Jeff Crowe had replied to the letter he gave on Monday, Dr Soni said: No What I do know is that Crowe spoke to the Australian captain (Ricky Ponting) after that We needed to put certain acts of misbehaviour on record and thats been done.         
	Calls to Crowes cell phone went unanswered.         
	Footnote: It rained almost throughout Thursday (a day off for the Dhonis) and the forecast isnt very good for the next two days either. However, as of now, the weather isnt expected to be a factor during the tri-series final No.1, on Sunday.

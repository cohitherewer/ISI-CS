The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bartons spot of catharsis 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bartons spot of catharsis 
            HENRY WINTER                      
	Football moves in strange ways, or Strangeways in Joey Bartons case, and the controversial midfielder celebrated his first start since leaving jail in Manchester by converting the penalty that set Newcastle United on their way to a hugely important victory.         
	Obafemi Martins headed a second for Newcastle but when the West Brom substitute Ishmael Miller pulled one back, Joe Kinnears side endured a fraught finale as the visitors stroked the ball around with all the adventure they had lacked in the first half. Newcastle held on grimly, bringing Kinnear his first win since being sworn in as caretaker manager four games ago.         
	With Tottenham Hotspur being revived by Harry Redknapp, Newcastle know they must show signs of life themselves if they are to rise from the Premier League basement. Desperate times call for desperate measures and Kinnear recalled Barton, who lacks fitness. He still played with typical hunger in the centre, where he was ably supported by Danny Guthrie, and will relish hitting the headlines for the right reasons. He was even voted Man of the Match.         
	Amidst all the dark days brought on by his myriad offences, during the long nights incarcerated at Her Majestys displeasure, Barton must have dreamt of passages of play like the one that unfolded in the 10th minute.         
	Making his first start since serving time for assault and affray, Barton himself began the move that led to Newcastle seizing the lead for the first time since August. The few jeers that greeted his selection had died in the cold Tyneside air by the time Barton slid a terrific pass into the box for Shola Ameobi to chase.         
	The lanky striker, too often too languid for local tastes, was in determined mood, reaching the ball ahead of Ryan Donk, West Broms inexperienced Dutch centre-half. Donk panicked, diving in to catch Ameobi. The Leazes End screamed for a penalty and Mike Dean agreed.         
	For a team not blessed with great self-belief, and particularly one with Michael Owen remaining on the sidelines, the question briefly arose over who would take responsibility.No question, in fact. Barton demanded the ball.         
	Barton charged across, scooping up ball, and placing it on the spot. His kick was equally confident, the ball despatched firmly past Scott Carson, a sweet moment for a player who normally stirs only sourness. Perfidious 1, Albion 0.         
	Barton celebrated as if this was release day, redemption day and pay-day rolled into one. Charging towards the Newcastle fans, Barton beat the badge on his chest, and those who derided his name before kick-off now sang his praises. A spot of catharsis in every sense, Bartons penalty still cannot mask the reality that he has brought shame on his profession and his club.

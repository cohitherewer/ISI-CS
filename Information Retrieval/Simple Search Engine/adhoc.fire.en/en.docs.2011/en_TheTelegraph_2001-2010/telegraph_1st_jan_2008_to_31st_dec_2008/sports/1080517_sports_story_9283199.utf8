The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jaipur ready for battle of Royals 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jaipur ready for battle of Royals 
                      
	Jaipur: Rajasthan Royals will have to come out fast from the aftershock of the serial blasts here and concentrate on the Indian Premier League game Saturday against a beleaguered Bangalore Royal Challengers at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium.         
	Home team captain Shane Warne, Shane Watson, Graeme Smith and coaching director Darren Berry were reportedly terrified by the blasts on Tuesday that killed over 60 people and were reluctant to return to the Pink City for the match.         
	However, after IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi assured that adequate security would be provided to the players, Warne and his boys are returning from their vacation in Goa to take on the Rahul Dravid-led team.         
	The hosts are sitting pretty at the top with 14 points and one more win will ensure them a place in the semi-finals.         
	At home, the hosts have won five matches on the trot and they would look to continue their winning streak tomorrow.         
	Their batting looks good with Watson, Yousuf Pathan, Swapnil Asnodkar and Graeme Smith in good nick and         
	The bowling, to be spearheaded by Warne himself, has a good variety. The skipper has said that he wants his bowlers to be the smartest and cleverest in the tournament.         
	We want to reach in semi-finals being at the top, Warne had said, making clear his intentions.         
	On the other hand, Royal Challengers have been a demoralised lot with a series of defeats and off the field controversy involving the team management.         
	Though at the bottom of the table, the Challengers would want to prove a point that they were not the punching bag of the tournament. (PTI)

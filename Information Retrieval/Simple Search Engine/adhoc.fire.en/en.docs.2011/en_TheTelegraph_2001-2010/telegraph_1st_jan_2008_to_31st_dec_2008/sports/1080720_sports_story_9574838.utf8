                  Sachin on way to his 69 on Saturday                     
	Colombo: Indian batsmen were made to struggle on a difficult track as Sri Lanka Board XI left the visitors gasping at 196 for eight on a rain-truncated second day of their three-day warm-up match on Saturday.         
	Sachin Tendulkar marked his return to competitive cricket with a gutsy 69 and Dinesh Kaarthik struck an unbeaten 58, but none of the other batsmen could hang around for long on a pitch, which gave some assistance to the bowlers.         
	The Indians, aiming to get as much batting practice ahead of the Test series which gets underway from July 23, were first interrupted by the weather and then by some tight and incisive bowling by the hosts.         
	The entire morning session was washed out due to rain and the visitors found the going tough when play actually resumed in gloomy conditions. The Indians, replying to Board XIs first innings total of 224, were tottering at 80 for five at one stage before Tendulkar and Kaarthik pulled the team out of the pits with a determined 92-run partnership.         
	Tendulkar seemed to be in a belligerent mood despite wickets falling at regular intervals and slammed eight boundaries and a six during his 76-ball knock. Kaarthik, on the other hand, was far more subdued as he tried to rebuild the innings after the early jolts.         
	Dammika Prasad was the most successful bowler for the home team, scalping three wickets for 30 runs, while Dilhara Fernando claimed two.         
	Resuming at the overnight score of four for one, the Indians lost Rahul Dravid (5) early as he was run out while Sourav Ganguly fell soon after with Prasad accounting for his wicket.         
	Tendulkar, however, seemed to be in no discomfort as he unleashed a flurry of strokes on both sides of the wicket. His two majestic cover drives brought in a huge applause from the crowd which cheered every shot from the magicians bat.         
	The Indians looked somewhat impatient and caved in to the unheralded Sri Lankan bowlers, many of whom are fighting for a place in the Test squad. (PTI)

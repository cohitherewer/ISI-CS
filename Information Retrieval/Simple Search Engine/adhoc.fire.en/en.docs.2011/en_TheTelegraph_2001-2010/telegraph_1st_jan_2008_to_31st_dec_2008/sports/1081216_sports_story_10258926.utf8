The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ND Heroes go down
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ND Heroes go down
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jaspal Singh                           
	Calcutta: JCT Phagwara defeated minnows New Delhi Heroes 1-0 in a group C match of the 30th Federation Cup here at the Barasat Stadium on Monday.         
	JCT took the lead in the 14th minute when Jaspal Singh converted from the penalty spot.         
	They now have six points from two wins.         
	New Delhi Heroes, in stark contrast to their performance in the meet so far, were defensive throughout, and that was what cost them the match.         
	Referee Pratap Singh gifted the Punjab outfit the penalty when Barister Rymbpi handled a Baljit Sahni cross inside the box. Baljit made a surging run before crossing the ball for Balwant Singh but Barister handled it midway.         
	This effort apart, JCT were a mediocre team in the first half. However, things started looking up for the Phagwara side after the lemon-break. They began the second half aggressively and soon had the New Delhi side with their backs against the wall.         
	This earned them a series of opportunities that, however, went to waste.               
	TEAM         
	JCT: Karanjit Singh, Jaspal Singh (Baldeep Singh Jr., 57), Anwar, Julius I Rabor Akpele, Daljit Singh, Jagpreet Singh, Shivraj Singh, Jaswinder Singh (Amandeep Singh, 46), Baljit Sahni, Balwant Singh, Balraj Singh

	Referee: Pratap Singh

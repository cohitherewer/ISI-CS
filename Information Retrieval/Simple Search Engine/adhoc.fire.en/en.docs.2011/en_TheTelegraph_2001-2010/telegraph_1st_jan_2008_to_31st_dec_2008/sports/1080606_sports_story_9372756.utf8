            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Twenty-nine time champions Bengal will begin their campaign to regain the Santosh Trophy after eight years with a quarter-final group league match against Goa in Srinagar on Friday.         
	Once known as the uncrowned king of the national championships, Bengal havent won the trophy since 1999.         
	This is Bengals biggest drought since the 60s when the title eluded them for six years in a row between 1962 and 1969. Finally it was left to Shanto Mitra and a bunch of young players to bring the trophy home with a memorable 6-1 win over Services in the final.         
	Given the strength of the current Bengal squad, one is not too sure whether Bengal can bring back those glorious days. Pitted in an extremely tough group, Bengal will have to first overcome mighty Goa on Friday.         
	Bengal coach Krishnendu Roy, a dependable defender for Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in the 80s, is unperturbed. One has to overcome tough challenges sooner or later to win a tournament like Santosh Trophy. So, I dont mind playing Goa first, he said.         
	Roy has more or less finalised his first eleven with Abhra Mondal in goal and Habibur Rehman, Kingshuk Roy, Seikh Azim and Debabrata Roy in defence. Lalkamal Bhowmick, Jayanta Sen, Mehtab Hussain and Snehasis Chakrabarty will feature in the midfield.

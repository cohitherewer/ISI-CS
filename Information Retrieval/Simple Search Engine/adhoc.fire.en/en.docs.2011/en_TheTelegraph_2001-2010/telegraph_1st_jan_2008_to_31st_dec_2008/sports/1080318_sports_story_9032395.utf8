The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinesh Karthik on standby for Dhoni
                                                   Dinesh Karthik on standby for Dhoni
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indias ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has been nursing an injury to one of his fingers on the right hand for a long time, will have to undergo a fitness test at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore on Friday.         
	In case Dhoni is found unfit, then his place would be taken by Dinesh Karthik in the XIV for the series-launching Test in Chennai from March 26.         
	Karthik, it may be recalled, was a passenger on the just-ended tour of Australia. He neither played in the Tests nor did he make an appearance in the tri-series. He did play the one-off Twenty20 International though.         
	Harbhajan Singh, who didnt attend Sundays fitness test at the Academy, has also been asked to appear on that day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | English fans rock the stadia
                                                                                                                                                                                           English fans rock the stadia
            JIM WHITE in MOSCOW                         
	Like most Muscovite architecture, the Luzhniki is a monumental stadium, solid and muscular, nothing shy or delicate about it.         
	Its roof is strapped down by more steel than Sheffield used to manufacture in a year. Which is just as well, the noise stoked up by the English invasion in Moscow would have threatened anything less substantial.         
	There was a sense of release in the hullabaloo, a feeling that they had been saving themselves for this, in the case of Uniteds fans for nine years and for Chelsea a lifetime. And all day, voices had been mute in the city, perhaps hushed in expectation.         
	There were one or two reports of scuffles, of English fans being set upon by local hooligans. But there was no responding in kind. With good reason, according to a senior United fan, who was accosted on his way back to his hotel on Tuesday night.         
	These kids came up to me and started giving it come on English, fighty fighty, he said. I said to them never mind fighty fighty, Im bloody fifty.         
	By the end of this game, he must have felt twice that.         
	The fan was speaking in the Red Square, where, under glowering, drizzle filled sky, familiar to anyone who has summered in the Lake District, the rival fans mixed good humouredly, under and this may have had something to do with it  the watchful gaze of the biggest mobilisation of Russian uniform since the war.         
	Reds and blues cheerfully swapped their war stories about the traffic jams, getting lost on the Metro system and the prices. Moscow must be the only city on earth capable of making the followers of a club sited on the Fulham Road reckon they have it cheap back home.         
	Nowhere are the prices more jaw dropping than in Gum, the shopping centre opposite Lenins tomb in Red Square. The place that, in the height of Soviet power, had the rare distinction among international stores of having nothing at all on its shelves, has been transformed into the worlds most glitzy and expensive mall, the kind of place to which Las Vegas aspires.                 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The fifth match of the ICL 20s Indian Championship saw in-form Chandigarh Lions defeat the Mumbai Champs by two wickets at the LB stadium in Hyderabad. Sarabjit Singh of the Lions was declared Man of the Match for his unbeaten knock of 41.         
	Lions skipper Chris Cairns won the toss and elected to field.         
	A middle order collapse, when Hasan Raza departed for 8 and Taufeeq Umar for 17, left the Mumbai innings in tatters. A 28-run partnership between Kiran Powar and Morris looked promising till Dinesh Mongia trapped Morris in the 12th over, leaving Mumbai struggling at 64/5.         
	The Champs bowlers came out firing all cylinders.         
	In the end, the nail-biter saw Sarabjit power the Lions home with a mighty six off the fourth ball of the last over.         
	Brief Scores: Mumbai Champs 135/6 (K. Powar 45, Khirid 18; Tuffey 2/25) Chandigarh Lions 137/8 (Sarabjit 41*). Lions won by 2 wickets.

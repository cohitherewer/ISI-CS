The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sports minister against Pak tour
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sports minister against Pak tour
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Union sports minister, M.S. Gill, on Friday expressed strong reservations against the Indian cricket teams tour of Pakistan early next year.         
	The Indian team is scheduled to tour Pakistan from January 6 to February 19 next year to play five one-dayers, three Test matches and one Twenty20 game.         
	The sports minister said he was convinced that Pakistan was involved in cross-border terrorism. People from their soil were indulging in mass murder in India, he said.         
	Gill also felt commercial reasons should not be a factor in deciding the fate of the series.         
	In a statement issued on Friday, the minister said: I have played cricket. I know the spirit of cricket. Cricket is not commerce. Is it possible for one team to arrive in Mumbai and indulge in mass murder and have another team go and play cricket in the winter afternoon sun, int Lahore, immediately after?         
	It requires those in authority in Pakistan to give a clear indication, satisfactory to the world, of doing everything possible to prevent such murderous incursion, and to root out the basis of it all, he said.         
	Gill, however, added that it was for the government to take a final decision on the subject.         
	A BCCI spokesperson said the board stood by its earlier decision. We will go by what the government decides, he commented.         
	Recently Indias junior hockey teams tour to Pakistan was cancelled for security reasons.         
	The Champions Trophy and Australias tour of Pakistan are also among the prominent cricketing events which were cancelled this year.

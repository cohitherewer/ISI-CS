The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We are still in the game, says Shane Watson
                                                                                                                                                                                                       We are still in the game, says Shane Watson
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Shane Watson in Mohali on Sunday                           
	Mohali: Australian allrounder Shane Watson admitted that the Australians were disappointed with their bowling performance but claimed to be still in the game despite lagging the Indians by more than 300 runs.         
	We are not happy with our performance as a bowling unit. We didnt get what we want and the Indian openers scored freely (in the second innings). We have to bat really well in the second innings, Watson told the media on Sunday.         
	We have to bat for a long time in the second innings.         
	Watson also vowed that they wouldnt give up too easily and would put up a fight. We are still in the game, he said after the days play.         
	We need to play two days of good cricket and see how it goes. Of course they are in a better position but we are never down and out till the game is over, Watson said.         
	Watson went on to claim that even if India set them a target of 450 with five sessions left, Australia would go for a win, instead of trying to save the match.         
	I think we can still win chasing a target like that. If we bat well, we can chase down any target.         
	The ball would turn and reverse as well, which means the job wont be easy. But as I said we can chase down anything if we bat well, he said.         
	The Australian also praised the performance of the Indian bowlers.         
	Mishra bowled really well. Hes getting the ball to turn a lot. Weve to play him really well in the second innings. Ishant also bowled brilliantly.         
	The way he dismissed Hussey, whos in great touch, was really crucial. That was the turning point for the Indians, the top-scorer in Australias first innings said.         
	Watson and Brett Lee on Sunday put on a record-equalling 73 runs for the eighth wicket during which, Watson said, there were some friendly banters.         
	He, however, said it never went out of control.         
	I think we had some extremely friendly banters. Me and Lee, we both were smiling... I guess it will always be there. It was never getting out of control and without that, I guess cricket would become dull and boring, he quipped.         
	Watson also said that the Australians were working on the technique of reverse-swinging the ball quicker.         
	Lot of the guys are new here. Were working on the technique to reverse swing it faster. The Indians are definitely getting it to reverse quicker, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bayern win
                                                     Bayern win
                  Klose                     
	London: Bayern Munich stamped their authority on the Uefa Cup on Thursday, hammering five goals past 10-man Anderlecht in Brussels in their last 16 first leg tie.         
	Goals from Hamit Altintop and Luca Toni in the first half and Lukas Podolski and substitutes Miroslav Klose and Franck Ribery in the second ensured four-times European champions Bayern a gentle workout in the second leg at home next week.         
	It was Anderlechts heaviest European defeat at home and followed a red card for Marcin Wasilewski just before halftime.         
	In a heavyweight last 16 boasting four other former European champions, PSV Eindhoven won 1-0 at Tottenham Hotspur when Peru striker Jefferson Farfan stole the ball from Gilberto and fired into the corner.         
	The result puts coach Juande Ramoss hopes of a Uefa Cup hattrick in peril. Ramos took Sevilla to the title in 2006 and 2007.         
	Gavin McCann scored for fellow Premier League side Bolton Wanderers in a 1-1 draw at home to Portugals Sporting. The third English side, Everton, were beaten 2-0 away to Fiorentina.

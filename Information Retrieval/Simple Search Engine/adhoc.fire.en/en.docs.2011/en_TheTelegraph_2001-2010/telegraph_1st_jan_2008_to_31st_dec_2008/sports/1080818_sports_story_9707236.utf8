	Beijing: Michael Phelps held his arms aloft on Sunday after surpassing Mark Spitz as the most successful swimmer and Olympian of all time, relief written on his face after he won an unprecedented eighth gold at one Games.         
	Afterwards, he said he just wanted to hug his mum.         
	There was more sprint delight for Jamaica, with a clean sweep of the medals in the womens 100 metres to go with compatriot Usain Bolts dazzling world record display in the mens race.         
	Shelly-Ann Fraser grinned and punched the air as she crossed the finish line then leapt and danced for joy, taking gold with a time of 10. 78 seconds. The US team lodged an appeal over the race, saying their sprinters believed there had been a false start, but it was rejected by athletics governing body.         
	Africa had a good day with Ethiopias Kenenisa Bekele triumphing in the mens 10,000m and Cameroons Francoise Mbango Etone winning gold in the womens triple jump.         
	With wins on Sunday in badminton, diving, gymnastics, rowing, shooting, table tennis and wrestling, the hosts reached 35 golds to the Americans 19, already three ahead of their Athens haul with seven days of competition to go.         
	In 2004, the US topped the table with 36 golds.         
	Sunday, day nine, was the busiest of the Aug. 8-24 Games, with 34 golds on offer. It began with a triumph for Romania in one of the Games most gruelling events, 38-year-old Constantina Tomescu claiming a surprise win in the womens marathon.         
	In the evening, it was the turn of the Jamaican sprinters again, Frasers exuberant celebration recalling that of Bolts. It was the first clean sweep in the womens 100 metres with compatriots Kerron Stewart and Sherone Simpson both finishing with a time of 10.98 seconds to clinch a rare double silver.         
	The Water Cube saw more excitement in the evening as Chinas diving diva Guo Jingjing retained her three-metre springboard crown to become the most prolific womens diving medallist.         
	She has won four Olympic golds and had planned to retire, but said she had now changed her mind and wanted to carry on.         
	Britain have scored eight gold medals in two days in cycling, rowing, sailing and the pool, taking them to third place in the medals table with 11 golds. The British press was already dubbing it the great haul of China.         
	The tennis tournament wrapped up with more glory for Rafael Nadal. He won the singles in straight sets to add to his Wimbledon and French Open crowns, defeating Chilean Fernando Gonzalez, the 2004 gold medallist in mens doubles at the Athens Games.         
	Americas Venus and Serena Williams also made up for singles disappointment by picking up a second Olympic doubles gold.         
	Elena Dementieva beat fellow Russian Dinara Safina to the singles crown, saying it was the greatest moment of her career.         
	In the highest-profile doping case of the Games, Greeces defending womens 400 metres hurdles champion Fani Halkia failed a drug test hours before she was to compete.         
	 There was a terrible sense of deja vu for US shooter Matt Emmons, who threw away gold for a second successive Games with a misfire on his final shot.         
	After shooting at the wrong target in Athens, a nervous Emmons this time squandered a huge lead on his final shot when he pulled the trigger by mistake while lining up.         
	That error let Chinas Qiu Jian take gold in the mens 50m rifle three-positions. Emmons finished fourth. I didnt feel my trigger shaking but I guess it was, he said. (REUTERS)

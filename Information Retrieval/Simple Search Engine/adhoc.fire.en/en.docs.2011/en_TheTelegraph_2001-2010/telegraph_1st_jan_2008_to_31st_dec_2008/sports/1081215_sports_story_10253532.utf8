The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Football needs a code of conduct
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Football needs a code of conduct

	So football has to be tougher. As society turns into a sort of civil war between those who know how to behave and those who, either on purpose or through institutionalised ignorance (take your pick in the cases of Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand), flout reasonable standards, the game must play its part in trying to save the planet, or at least its vestiges of dignity.         
	Assisted where necessary, of course, by the police. In this context, while the arrest by Hampshire police of two spectators who allegedly shouted racist and homophobic insults at Sol Campbell when Tottenham visited Portsmouth is thoroughly welcome, I wonder if a force would be as zealous in a case in which the alleged abuse came from a home crowd.         
	Equally, while the Football Association were entitled to criticise a courts failure to impose a nationwide football banning order on a Newcastle fan who had pleased guilty to racist chanting at Middlesbroughs Egyptian striker Mido  the offender had made hideously inappropriate jokes about bombers  I wondered if this was the same FA whose supporters last month littered Berlin with references to the Second World War, including a song about bombers which had become almost inescapable during the World Cup held in Germany. If racism involves nationality, are not Germans as entitled to protection as Egyptians?         
	As so often, authority, or what passes for it, seems to be making up the rules as it goes along. All the FA and Leagues have to do is sit down, agree a code of conduct with representatives of players and fans organisations (if Didier Drogba is rightly to be suspended for throwing a coin into a crowd, it must work the other way round) and make sure it is properly enforced.         
	They need not take an age, even though there are fascinating questions to be resolved: is it abuse, for example, to call Wayne Rooney fat or mention his erstwhile stand against age discrimination in carnal encounters, or to accuse referees of sexual self-sufficiency?         
	You are always in danger of flirting with the ridiculous when you address behaviour. But to do nothing is just as dangerous. Eight days ago at the Emirates Stadium, which I always expect to be an especially pleasant ground to visit, the mass bullying of Emmanuel Eboue ended an afternoon throughout which Arsenal fans had yelled four-letter insults  mainly at Arsenal players  in the presence of children without any action by stewards. So much for gentrification: decades on from Heysel, our game is neither one thing nor the other.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Calcutta: Ashley Noffke and Adam Voges were added to the Australian squad for Sundays opening Commonwealth Bank series one-day International against India in Brisbane. 
    
	According to a Cricket Australia release, allrounder Noffke was drafted into the squad as a replacement for paceman Stuart Clark, who has withdrawn from the match for family reasons. Clark is expected to rejoin in Sydney next week. 
    
	Top-order batsman Voges was added to the squad on standby in case either Ricky Ponting or Matthew Hayden is ruled out with injury.

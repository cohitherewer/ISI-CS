The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anil Kumble, the leader, in a different numbers game
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anil Kumble, the leader, in a different numbers game
    - Test captains blast in Bangalore probably directed at establishment too           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Anil Kumble                                 
	Calcutta: Its odd that right through his 18-plus years as a distinguished India cricketer, Test captain Anil Kumble has hardly consistently bagged endorsements. He has never been seen much on hoardings (certainly not at all in recent times) and only occasionally makes the ads in print or on the TV.         
	With over 950 wickets at the international level, Kumbles definitely high on numbers. Its just that he isnt quite into the kind of numbers game which, in many quarters, has come to determine the standing of a cricketer. In India, at least.         
	At times, Ive thought things could have been different... However, I dont carry a hype... My manner, perhaps, doesnt appeal to many, Kumble told The Telegraph in Lahore, in early 2006, when he was on the threshold of 500 Test wickets.         
	But, then, one shouldnt be judging Kumble on endorsements. Not only on the number of wickets he has taken in Test cricket  an awesome 616  either. If anything, he should be judged more on the leadership (even in the many years that he wasnt the captain) provided by him.         
	Leading the attack, after all, also involves leadership. A Glenn McGrath will confirm that.         
	Kapil Dev and Sourav Ganguly would probably have reacted like Kumble did, in (home town) Bangalore the other day, but most captains would have left it to the Board to clarify the bit about seniors. Why? Because it pays to be politically correct.         
	Kumble, though, couldnt care less.         
	Everybody needs to be a bit more respectful when they discuss cricketers. If thats done, then we dont mind the scrutiny... But when its done in a rubbish manner, and the way it has been portrayed, then it hurts, are excerpts from the uncharacteristic Kumble-blast on Thursday, some 24 hours after the selectors chose the Team India XV for the first two Tests against Australia.         
	Given that some in the Board are inclined to do away with the senior-most pros at the earliest, those comments were probably directed at the Establishment as well.         
	Neither the Board president, Shashank Manohar, nor secretary N.Srinivasan bothered to clear the air and, so, the Souravs will remain indebted to Kumble.         
	Kumble had been a role model-leader during the high-on-tension days after the Harbhajan Singh-Andrew Symonds spat in Sydney, this January, too. The remarkable manner in which he conducted everything quickly earned him the Elder Statesman label from many across Australia.         
	Leadership had been the need of the hour and the unbelievably calm Kumble wasnt found wanting.         
	Later, he explained: Thats my nature... Its about the way I am... Ive always been a quiet kind of a guy... I guess its very difficult getting to know what Im thinking... I like to stay relaxed and thats a mental thing...         
	Just days away from his 38th birthday, Kumble isnt getting younger. But, as he pointed out in Bangalore, if age was the criterion, I should have retired some time back.         
	By his own admission, Kumble wasnt anywhere near his best in the last Test series, in Sri Lanka, but thats not to say the Australians will also have it easy.         
	Eventually, at some point, the innings ending call will be taken by Kumble. One hopes its not too soon, for we need him as a bowler and, as crucially, a leader.

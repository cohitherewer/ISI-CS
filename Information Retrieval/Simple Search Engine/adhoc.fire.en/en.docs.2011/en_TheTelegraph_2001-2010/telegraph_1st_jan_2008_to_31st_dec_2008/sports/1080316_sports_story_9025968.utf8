The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand draws with Kramnik 
                                                     Anand draws with Kramnik 
                    Viswanathan Anand                
	Nice: World champion Viswanathan Anand started his campaign with a draw in the blindfold game against Vladimir Kramnik of Russia in the first round of the Amber Blindfold and Rapid chess tournament here.         
	Playing the white side of a Petroff defence in the first game of the tournament, Anand followed the variation he had played against Kramnik some time back but the defending champion was adequately prepared and drew without much ado.         
	The event is being played on a round robin basis between 12 players. Each player face each other twice  in blindfold and then in rapid  and the combined score is taken to decide the winner.         
	Bulgarian Veselin Topalov emerged winner against Peter Leko of Hungary. It was a Catalan opening that proved too tough for the Hungarian as he lost his way in the resulting middle game and ensuing endgame. Topalov won a couple of pawns and won in 45 moves.         
	In the other game of the first session of the opening round, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan drew with Alexander Morozevich of Russia. It was a long drawn encounter in a Nimzowitsch defense by Morozevich wherein he had a better endgame.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Butt awaits govt clearance 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Butt awaits govt clearance 
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt is awaiting government clearance to attend the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) executive meeting in Chennai on Friday.         
	PCB officials Tuesday confirmed that although Butt was booked on a flight to New Delhi for Wednesday, he had still not got the requisite clearance from the government.         
	He was due to leave tomorrow but I dont think he will be able to go since he requires clearance from the government to travel to India which he has not got so far, the official said.         
	Butts visit to Chennai for the ACC meet is crucial since he is due to have one-to-one talks with his Indian counterpart Shashank Manohar on the prospects of the Indian team touring Pakistan early next year.         
	Butt was looking to also discuss the possibility of playing the series at neutral venues if the Indians didnt get clearance from their government to tour Pakistan next month, another PCB official said.         
	The BCCI has said it can only confirm the tour if given security clearance by the Indian government.           (PTI)

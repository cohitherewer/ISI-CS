The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Heat a worry, says Sehwag
                                                   Heat a worry, says Sehwag
                      
	Chennai: Virender Sehwag feels South Africa are a good Test side but Graeme Smith and his boys would find it very difficult to cope with the sweltering heat in Chennai.         
	(They are a) good side Very strong in batting and bowling. But it remains to be seen how they cope with the heat in Chennai.         
	The swashbuckling opener had hit a century in his last innings in the drawn Adelaide Test against Australia.         
	I have lot of confidence... My last innings in a Test was a 150, so I know what I am doing. I will look to survive the first hour and dominate in the next, he said at a press conference on Monday.         
	Sehwag said India would benefit from the home advantage.         
	Home series is very important. Youve grown up in India and played a lot of cricket here. You know better than others how to play here and you know it is a good chance to perform.         
	The conditions may favour the spinners, but Sehwag feels Paul Harris will find the going tough.         
	I have seen their attack because the same bowlers played against us when we were in South Africa. Harris may or may not get wickets because we play spin well but he will have to work hard to be successful.         
	The Delhi bastman also insisted that he had no issues playing under any captain in Tests or one-dayers and was willing to bat at any number.         
	I have no problem playing under any captain. I gave my fitness test and proved my fitness. And I do not mind batting at any number, he said.         
	Sehwag said the heat was a worrying factor not only for the visitors but for the Indians too. We are not worried about the bowlers, we are worried about how we will manage the heat.         
	I think South Africa have done well in the past because they got conditions that really suited them. There was swing and pace in South Africa and they exploited that. But they wont get similar conditions here, he said.         
	The dashing opener, who was dropped for first two Tests Down Under, said the Chepauk strip is similar to the Australian wickets.         
	Not too much difference between the Chennai wicket and the ones in Australia. The bounce is almost the same, only the pace is a little less, he said.         
	On being asked about the changes brought in by coach Gary Kristen, Sehwag said: Not too many changes... Only man-management and facilities are better after Kirsten took over the reins. There is no time wastage during the practice. Everyone does what they are supposed to do.         
	We have point-to-point talk at meetings. We had not expected him to be so well prepared. We are very keen to work with him, he said.         
	On the senior-junior issue, Sehwag said, I dont think there is any debate in the team regarding seniors and juniors. And the pressure is on everyone. The pressure should be about performing and not answering questions to the media.         
	As for Paddy Uptons role, Sehwag said: I have discussed mental toughness issues with him. It was quite a fruitful one and hopefully a few positives will come out of the discussion.

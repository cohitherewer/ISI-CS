                                                   CSA wont change policy
                      
	Durban: The transformation policy in South African cricket would go ahead even though some forces were against it, Board president Norman Arendse has said. The Cricket South Africa boss said he was not trying to push his own agenda but merely following the transformation policies. I had on three occasions, before the team left for Bangladesh, asked for the policy to have six players of colour in the team to be met. But on three occasions my call was rejected by some of the selectors, said Arendse.   
	Bashar axed  
	 Chittagong: Bangladesh have axed veteran batsman and former captain Habibul Bashar from the 12-man squad for the second and final Test against South Africa starting in Chittagong on Friday. Rajin Saleh, who was rested for the first Test, has been drafted into the side to replace Bashar.   
	Rafique livid  
	Chittagong: Mohammed Rafique will quit international cricket after the second and final Test against South Africa. Ive decided to quit international cricket as mark of protest against a group in the Bangladesh Cricket Board, who do not like to see me in squads, Rafique said on Thursday.   
	SA rest seniors  
	 Chittagong: Senior players Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher and Makhaya Ntini will be rested for South Africas limited-over series against Bangladesh, team officials said on Thursday.         
	THE SQUAD         
	Graeme Smith, Herschelle Gibbs, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Albie Morkel, Vernon Philander, Johan Botha, Morne Morkel, Charl Langeveldt, Dale Steyn, Andre Nel, Paul Harris, Alviro Petersen.  
	Lawson warning  
	 Karachi: Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson feels national cricket boards should be careful before going overboard about the Indian Premier League and the unofficial Indian Cricket League as the real worth of these Twenty20 tournaments would be known in a couple of years.   
	New recruits  
	 Wellington: Fast bowler Shane Bond left New Zealand to play in the rebel Indian Cricket League. He was joined by opening batsman Lou Vincent, who became the latest New Zealand player to join ICL, angering officials by turning his back on an existing national contract. Vincent is the 10th New Zealander to join the rebel league.

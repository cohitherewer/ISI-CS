                                                   Aussie media slams Bhajji decision 

           
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the International Cricket Council (ICC) have come under attack from sections of the Australian media after Harbhajan Singh was cleared of racially abusing Andrew Symonds. 
    
	Australian newspapers accused the BCCI of using their financial muscle to hold the world game to ransom while criticising the ICC for bowing to their demands. 
    
	The following are some of the reports that appeared in the Australian newspapers regarding ICC appeals commissioner Justice John Hansens ruling over the issue: 
    
	THE ADELAIDE ADVERTISER: The International Cricket Councils incompetence, Indian influence and Australian subservience have combined to damage the game in two days of madness. It has been argued the ICC imitates the United Nations as a toothless tiger, super power India mirrors an imperial United States while Australia is now made to grovel like a third-world nation. The initial Harbhajan Singh race row has included all the hallmark mayhem, intrigue and drama of a Bollywood flick. Critically, crickets murky world order has been exposed in the Federal Court of Adelaide. 
    
	THE AUSTRALIAN: India, the team that bleated about the spirit of cricket after being beaten in Sydney, has again held a gun to the games head and had its demands met. India pulled out every stop to pressure the International Cricket Council and Cricket Australia to cave in at the appeal hearing. The billionaire superpower of world cricket threatened for the second time in a month to go home if it didnt get its way, while its players refused to continue with the tour and remained in the luxury team hotel in Adelaide. The Indians also held the tour to ransom by pulling the same stunt after the Sydney Test when Harbhajan was convicted. 
    
	HERALD SUN: Indias reputation as the heavyweight of world cricket was reinforced last (Tuesday) night when Harbhajan Singh was cleared of racially abusing Australias Andrew Symonds. Despite transcripts from the Nine Networks stump microphones confirming Symonds stance that he had been branded a monkey, the racial vilification charge was downgraded to a count of using abusive language Had Harbhajan been from any other nation, its unlikely the charge would have been dropped. 
    
	THE DAILY TELEGRAPH: India executed an astonishing political power-play when they achieved a courtroom compromise in the Harbhajan Singh race row in Adelaide last (Tuesday) night. BCCI officials were celebrating the verdict, which effectively questioned the integrity of Symondss original evidence and that of referee Proctor. BCCI president Sharad Pawar underlined the extent of cashed-up Indias unilateral power base  making the claiming that no India player was racist.

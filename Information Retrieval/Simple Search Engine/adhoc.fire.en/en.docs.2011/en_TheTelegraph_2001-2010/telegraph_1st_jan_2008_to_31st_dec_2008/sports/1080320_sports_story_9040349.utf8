                                                     Bindra: I wont be the super CEO
  - I respect boundaries and the responsibilities given to others, says ICCs principal adviser       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Calcutta: Inderjit Singh Bindra, who has just been appointed as the first-ever principal adviser to the International Cricket Council (ICC), doesnt intend over-stepping the clearly demarcated boundaries.         
	Theres nothing one can do about perceptions but I definitely wont be the super chief executive officer (CEO) Rather, Im going to follow the clearly demarcated boundaries, Bindra told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from New Delhi on Wednesday, some hours after returning from Dubai, he added: The very nature of my role is to advise I cant usurp the powers of the next CEO (South Africas Imtiaz Patel) I dont function that way either In fact, I also believe in consensus and not confrontation and Imtiaz will have my complete support         
	Bindra, who was the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president from 1993-96, actually has an all-encompassing brief: Advising on development to spreading the game in North America and China to resolving disputes between member nations to helping in the smooth conduct of major events like the World Cup         
	Enough to make any CEO somewhat envious (perhaps, even quite nervous) but Bindra insisted Malcolm Speeds successor wouldnt have to worry.         
	Look, its the CEO who implements and hes the one with the powers Being an adviser, my role is going to be limited I wont be the one executing decisions and Ill be happy working in the background I respect boundaries and the responsibilities given to others In any case, absolutely nobody is bigger than the game, he pointed out.         
	However, the reality is that nobody even on the executive board is as experienced as Bindra in the functioning of the ICC.         
	Indeed, except for between 1997-2005, Bindra has been privy to the goings-on in the world body from around 1984.         
	That break occurred because Jagmohan Dalmiya (then calling the shots in the BCCI) sidelined him after they fell out.         
	It has still been quite a run for Bindra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Charlesworth turns down curtailed role
                                                   Charlesworth turns down curtailed role
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Ric Charlesworth on Monday refused to accept the curtailed role offered to him by the ministry of sports and the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF).         
	The Australian hockey legend, who arrived in the capital on Monday morning at the behest of the ministry, was not willing to restrict his role to the junior mens and the womens squads.         
	That was not part of the deal, he told The Telegraph and made it clear that he was only interested in coaching the senior national team.         
	Things dont work that way. I have not come to India to do that (coaching the juniors), an irate Charlesworth said.         
	When asked whether he would like to coach the junior mens and senior womens squads only, Charlesworth categorically said: No.         
	The Australians rebuff came after the IHF once again had its way and managed to convince the ministry to keep Charlesworth at bay from the senior national team.         
	After a four-hour meeting on Monday with top IHF officials  that included supremo K.P.S. Gill  the ministry decided to finalise Charlesworths appointment as the technical advisor but said the Australian would only look after the junior programmes of the federation.         
	Charlesworth will be asked to take care of the under-19 and under-21 squads and also the womens squad that is preparing to qualify for the Olympic Games, ministry sources said.         
	The legendary Australians refusal has come as a blow for Gill and Co., who were keen to limit him to guiding the juniors. If Charlesworth, who is likely to meet the ministry officials in the next couple of days, doesnt relent, the federation will have to come out with a new formula to keep the FIH happy.         
	According to sources, the IHF is all set to retain Carvalho as the national coach. The beleaguered Carvalho, who declared that he was stepping down after the Santiago debacle, has been summoned to Delhi on Tuesday for a review meeting and was secretly asked to keep his list of probables for the Azlan Shah tournament ready.         
	Strangely, though Charlesworth arrived on Monday, he was never asked to come over to the ministry for a meeting.         
	While the ministry and IHF officials deliberated, the four-time Olympian was left to cool his heels for a call.         
	It is like waiting for Godot, he quipped, sitting at his hotel room. Later, however, IHF officials asked him to come over for a meeting with Gill.

      STAR RACER
              
	Calcutta: It may pay to follow the trainer-jockey combinations of Vijay Singh and C. Alford in the New Years Day race card. Vijay has been patiently waiting for the win-hungry Alfords return from his one-month suspension which ended on Monday. While the duos Oxford Street and Elusive Study appear to be reasonably good bets in their respective events, the duos Arcology may have to fight out the issue with Piato in the afternoons feature event, the 1,200m Indian Produce Stakes. 
     
	In their debut encounter, a much fitter Piato had drubbed Arcology by nearly five lengths. Now the Vijay trainee is ready for the fray, while the Vinayak-trained ward may have to contend with the winners penalty of 4kg which may work to the advantage of Arcology.
         
	The eight-event card boasts of crowded fields, perhaps, never seen in earlier editions of the January 1 races. Nevertheless, Saarah Alam is also the one who may cash in on her recent form in the lower division of the Comedy Of Errors Cup. Imperial Romance and Triple Edge are the other two who are out to make amends for their earlier failures.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

                                                   Its time to embrace IPL: Warne 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Shane Warne thinks its time to market Twenty20 cricket and embrace the IPL.         
	I think we all now know Twenty20 is here to stay. In just a weeks time a live auction will take place for about 88 players who are going to take part in the IPL competition.         
	To me, its quite simple  its a very exciting time for the sport and to market the brand.         
	We should all be embracing the IPL rather than trying to fight it, he wrote in his column for Australias Daily Telegraph.         
	From the international boards point of view and the bosses around the world at county clubs and in domestic competitions I understand there may be issues about players missing for a certain time or a clash of sponsors.         
	But here in Australia, each state has cricket sponsors that differ from our national ones, so I dont buy that argument.         
	This issue can be overcome, he said.         
	Imagine how good it would be seeing Glenn McGrath bowling to Adam Gilchrist, and M.S. Dhoni behind the stumps? Exciting, I reckon.         
	I have been involved as captain of Hampshire in county cricket for the past four years and have seen Twenty20 evolve into a wonderful, entertaining form of the game          
	I have only played a couple of Twenty20games, so I am looking forward to playing the next three years.         
	I really believe its going to be a huge success; the TV rights have already been sold for more than $1billion and its only going to grow, the leg-spinner said.

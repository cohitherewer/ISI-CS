The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jayawardene aims to be consistent
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jayawardene aims to be consistent
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dambulla: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene on Sunday asked his team to be more consistent and said the Dambulla wicket has something in it for both fast bowlers and spinners.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	On the team combination         
	Not really, well go back speak to the selectors, then take a decision. Its the first time weve practised here. We had a look at the wicket.                     
	The conditions in Dambulla         
	I dont think its just the wicket. When you are playing day and night games, the lights contribute a bit. These are day games, and the day games we have had here have been pretty much good scores. The wind is a factor. The wicket seems to have something in it for both fast bowlers and spinners, a bit of bounce and spin. Thats a contributing factor for low scores. It looks a good, fresh, hard wicket, so you dont know.         
	On Sanath Jayasuriya         
	Sanath in form is always a great thing because he can contribute with both bat and ball. And the start he gets makes a huge difference. If he stays for 10 or 15 overs, you are guaranteed a good start. Hes a bit like Sehwag for India.         
	On Indias strengths and weaknesses         
	Theyve got a lot of talent, and they play a different game. As a team they have their strengths and weaknesses. Thats where we need to make sure we focus and execute our plans, whatever we need to do.         
	On Sri Lankas positives         
	We didnt bat well in Australia. In one-day cricket you need to put runs on the board. Thats what we lacked, nothing to do with Ajantha or not. Its a combined effort.         
	Ajantha is just a trump card, an attacking option, but there are so many others who contribute. You take the innings that Sanath played in the final or the one Sangakkara played before that. Australia is like eight months ago. Weve moved on. We need to work hard.         
	Lack of consistency         
	After the World Cup final we lacked a bit of consistency. No excuses, we didnt consistently maintain our standards. The Asia Cup is where we turned it around, where we maintained it with bat, ball and fielding.         
	Thats what we need to maintain. Thats the toughest thing for most international teams, to consistently be in that competitive level. From there, percentage-wise youll probably get more wins than losses.

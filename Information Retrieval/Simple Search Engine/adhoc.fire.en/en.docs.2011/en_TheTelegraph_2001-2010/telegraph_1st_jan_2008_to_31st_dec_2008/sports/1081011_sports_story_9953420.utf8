The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taking one match at a time: Rozario
                                                                                                                                                                                           Taking one match at a time: Rozario
            OUR PRINCIPAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: East Bengal coach Stanley Rozario has tried to downplay the setback of losing key players Sunil Chhetri, Alvito DCunha and Edmilson for the away match against Air India on Sunday.         
	It is a little bit worrying but others like Ashim Biswas will get to play, said Rozario after the teams training session at the Cooperage on Friday.         
	Chhetri has been ruled out of action for seven days and DCunha for two weeks, both due to injuries picked up from their last match against Mumbai FC last week.         
	Brazilian Edmilson has been diagnosed with jaundice while Surkumar was also yet to recover from an injury.         
	Rozario rued the teams missed chances during their 0-1 loss against Mumbai FC.         
	We squandered at least six chances. We dominated the match and created the chances, but still could not score, he lamented.         
	East Bengal are currently placed third along with United SC and Churchill Brothers  all have three points each. Sporting Clube de Goa and debutants Mumbai FC are atop the league table with six points each while JCT are second with four.         
	Rozario said keeping pace with the league leaders was vital. Every match is important. It is a marathon league. But we are taking one match at a time, he said.         
	This is the first away match of the season for East Bengal who are scheduled to play their next five matches at home. Does it necessarily mean good for the team?         
	Playing home, you have the pressure of the fans supporting you. Playing away, you have the pressure of the opponents crowd, he said.

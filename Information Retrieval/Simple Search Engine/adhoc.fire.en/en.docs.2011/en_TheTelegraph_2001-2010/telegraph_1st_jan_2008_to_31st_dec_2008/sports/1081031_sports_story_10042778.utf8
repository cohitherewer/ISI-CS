                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chess is too intelligent for my brain: Abhinav Bindra
    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Ace with the golden gun salutes Anand             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Abhinav Bindra                                 
	Calcutta: Abhinav Bindra, clearly, needs no introduction.         
	Indias only individual gold medal-winner in the Olympics (he created history in Beijing), seen by many as our greatest sportsman, spoke to The Telegraph from his Chandigarh farmhouse on Thursday afternoon. The interview had everything to do with his and Grandmaster Viswanathan Anands stupendous achievements.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Reaction to Anands win, his third world championship crown, that too in a different format         
	A fantastic achievement... The way Anand has dominated chess, over a period of time, has been quite incredible... Only a few can manage to dominate in the manner he has.         
	If hed been following the world championship         
	In the later stages, yes... Id been aware that Anand needed just half-a-point on Wednesday.         
	Interest in chess         
	Have never been keen... Its too intelligent a sport for my little brain!         
	Whether, despite being a big achiever himself, he envies Anand         
	(Laughs) No... Why should I? I respect him as a fellow sportsman and a top achiever... I admire his consistency, for I know its not easy to win regularly over a period of time... Anand stands out.         
	The greatest Indian sportsman label arguably being a toss-up between him and Anand         
	Id say its ridiculous to suggest its a fight between us... Its not fair to compare achievements... In any case, chess isnt an Olympic sport... This debate could be interesting for you in the media, but has no relevance otherwise.         
	Anands achievement vis--vis his         
	Its hard for me to comment and Id go to the extent of saying a connection shouldnt be attempted between shooting and chess... Be it my Olympic gold or Anands world titles, theyve each been great achievements in their own way.         
	One common element  mental toughness         
	Shooting, you know, has a physical side but it doesnt get portrayed... To be mentally fit, you need to be in shape physically... Being fit physically helps you focus better. Theres a distinct relation... The mental aspect is, of course, greater in chess.         
	What goes into the making of a champion par excellence?         
	Plenty of preparation... Its mental, physical and tactical... Im not sure of the frequency of the world chess championship, but one has to deliver when it matters... As they say, its about peaking at the right time. It doesnt come easy, though.         
	Pressure faced by big achievers         
	Anand, I reckon, has been handling the expectations well... Where Im concerned, my own expectations matter the most and I shut off the external ones... Nobody, after all, can control the external expectations... So, keep them out... Today, I dont think theres any pressure on me as Ive achieved what Id set out to... Depends on the perspective you take.         
	Whether the individual success stories say something about sport in India         
	Its a fact that Anand and I have won as individuals... I wouldnt say the country doesnt have a system at all, it does, but so much fine-tuning is needed... Theres enough talent around, but the gifted need support by way of facilities and finances... The talent needs to be harnessed.         
	The talent bit         
	Its unmatched... Sadly, untapped too.         
	Lessons which youngsters can learn from him and Anand         
	Our story is one of passion, hard work, discipline... Of determination, having the will... Everybody wont go to the Olympics, but everybody has some talent that should be utilised to realise goals... One needs to have the right attitude as well.         
	If life has changed two-and-a-half months after his gold         
	Well, there has been a lot of euphoria, but I live life in a practical way... Ive achieved what Id aspired to and, now, Its all about waiting for a fresh challenge... Im waiting for something to excite me.         
	Next tournament         
	The calendar for 2009 will be out in a months time... Ive worked very hard, for years and years, and am taking a break from competitive shooting... Frankly, Ill get back to competition when I have the energy and, as important, the desire.         
	Finally, whether hes disappointed he couldnt watch hero Sachin Tendulkar get the world record in Mohali, which is a stones throw away from home town Chandigarh         
	(Laughs) Yes, thats there... To get 12,000 Test runs is just awesome... Actually, Im more disappointed I couldnt watch the superb team effort in that Test in person. I hope we win the ongoing series.

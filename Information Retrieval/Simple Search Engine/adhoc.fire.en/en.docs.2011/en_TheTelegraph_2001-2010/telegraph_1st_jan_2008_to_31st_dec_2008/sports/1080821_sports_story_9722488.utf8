	Beijing: Usain Bolt produced another barely believable performance of dominating sprinting to break Michael Johnsons untouchable world record on Wednesday and add 200 metres gold to the 100 he won in record time four days ago.         
	While the Jamaican crossed the line dancing in the 100, he was all business in his preferred race, needing all his lithe power to finish in 19.30 seconds, two-hundredths better than Johnsons mark and more than three tenths ahead of his own previous best.         
	It made him the ninth man to complete the Olympic double and the first since Carl Lewis in 1984, but he is the first to take both races with world records.         
	Im shocked, I have been aspiring to the world record for so long, said Bolt, who achieved the mark despite a 0.9 second headwind. I ran the corner as hard as possible and once I hit the straight I told myself to keep it up. The 200 medal has been my dream.         
	Johnson called Usain Bolt Superman 2 after the Jamaican broke his world record.         
	Superman 2... incredible, said the just dethroned Johnson. Incredible performance by Usain Bolt once again. He finished up in an incredible time. This was an incredible performance, he wanted that record.         
	Congratulations Usain Bolt. He got an incredible start. I looked at his start and just went wow. It was more amazing than the 100 metres... Guys that tall should not be able to start like that said Johnson.         
	He wanted that record. This is his favourite event, he went for it, he came in focused on it, knowing he would most likely win the gold.         
	My concern was he would not have the ability to hold that speed for the entire race but he showed he has been working on that. He used every ounce of energy, he wanted that record.         
	Churandy Martina of Netherlands Antilles took silver in 19.82 and bronze went to defending champion Shawn Crawford of the US in 19.96 after his compatriot Wallace Spearmon was disqualified for running out of his lane.         
	American Carl Lewis was the last man to win both sprints at the same Games in Los Angeles and Bolt became just the ninth athlete to achieve the feat.         
	Bolt started well again to hit the front before he came off the bend and he powered down the straight to win by at least five metres. The 6ft 5in (1.96m) former world junior champion owned the best time of this year (19.67) and finished second behind American Tyson Gay at the 2007 world championships in Osaka.         
	When an injury at the US trials deprived Gay of the chance to run the 200m in Beijing, Bolt immediately became a strong favourite for the event.         
	Bolts coach Glen Mills had always wanted him to emulate Johnson by doubling up in the 200 and 400 but he had never enjoyed the tougher training for the one-lap event.         
	The pair reached an agreement last year that if he broke the Jamaican 200m record of 1976 Olympic champion Don Quarrie, he would be allowed to try the 100 and the reggae-loving Bolt duly delivered.         
	The impressive 10.03 seconds he ran in his first outing in the 100 in 2007 was just a prelude to his remarkable assault on the event in 2008 and he has now set new world marks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Narain gives India 2nd win
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Narain gives India 2nd win
                                  A1 Team India rsquo;s Narain Karthikeyan negotiates a turn at the Brands Hatch circuit on Sunday. The win in the A1 GP season finale is India rsquo;s second after Zhuhai      
	Brands Hatch: Narain Karthikeyan held off sustained pressure from local hero Robbie Kerr to give Team India their second A1GP victory in the series finale here Sunday.         
	The only Formula One driver from India lost the lead to Kerr in the first round of pitstops, only to regain it when Team Great Britain produced a slow service that cost the Englishman three seconds, and the chance to take a precious double at his home circuit.         
	In the end, despite Karthikeyan making a number of unforced errors, Kerr simply could not find a way past the Indian, who added to his Zhuhai Feature Race win in China (December 2007).         
	Newly-crowned champions Neel Jani and Switzerland took third place at the expense of rivals Team Ireland and Team Germany.         
	Early in the race, Adam Carrolls Irish car had looked feisty indeed and he could have emerged the race winner himself had he not clipped the back of Indias car after the first pitstops on lap 15.         
	A couple of laps later and his front wing collapsed on the run down to Pilgrims Drop, puncturing his front tyre and counting him out of contention. Germany also suffered a puncture while running third late in the race, handing the final podium position to Jani.         
	Congfu Cheng and China finished fourth, avoiding the chaos that ensued around them. Franck Montagny took fifth position for France, while Hollands Jeroen Bleekemolen just managed to stay ahead of Portugals Filipe Albuquerque to take sixth.         
	Team New Zealand managed to maintain their second place in the points standings by finishing eighth, having lost a place to Albuquerque late on in a spectacular pass around the outside at Hawthorns. The hosts second place puts them third in the final standings.         
	Italy finished ninth in the Feature Race with Edoardo Piscopo, while Indonesias Satrio Hermanto was ecstatic to score Indonesias first, and only, point of the season.         
	Earlier in the 15-lap sprint race, Karthikeyan gathered six points with a fifth place finish. Starting fifth at the grid, Karthikeyan did well to maintain his position and took 19 minutes 23: 610 seconds, a gap of 0.342 seconds from the Kerr.

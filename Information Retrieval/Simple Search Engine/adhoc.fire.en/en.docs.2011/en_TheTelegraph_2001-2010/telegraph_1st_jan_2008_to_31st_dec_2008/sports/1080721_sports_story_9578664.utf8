  - Double finish for Force India             Lewis Hamilton after his win on Sunday                           
	Hockenheim: McLarens Lewis Hamilton won a thrilling German Grand Prix on Sunday to forge four points clear of Ferraris Felipe Massa at the top of the Formula One championship.         
	Brazilian rookie Nelson Piquet, who had started in 17th place on a one-stop strategy, finished an astonishing second for Renault after leading for six laps in the race of his life. Compatriot Massa was third.         
	Force India registered only its second double finish of the season as Giancarlo Fisichella finished 14th and Adrian Sutil ended the race at 16th. Fisichella took 1:32:19.967 minutes to finish while Sutil finished with a timing of 1:32:30.362.         
	Fisichella said he could have got a better placing but was satisfied to finish the race. quot;In the first part, I was not comfortable with the car as I was struggling with the grip and it was understeering and oversteering with some wheelspin, but then at the end of the run it was getting better.         
	Hamilton led from pole position at engine partners Mercedes home track but the 23-year-old had to make an inspired fightback from fifth place with 16 laps remaining after a safety car interlude shook up his strategy.         
	I didnt plan on doing that. Id have much preferred an easy, comfortable afternoon out front, he said. Overall it was a very, very good weekend. Its got to be the best weekend up to now, added Hamilton.I think that were really on top of our game right now.         
	The victory was his second in a row  and eighth of his career, after a dominant performance in the wet at the previous British Grand Prix two weeks ago and made him the first driver to win four times this season. Hamilton now has 58 points to Massas 54. Ferraris world champion Kimi Raikkonen, who started and finished sixth on Sunday, has 51.         
	Sorry that we made it a little bit more difficult for you, McLaren boss Ron Dennis told Hamilton on the radio after the Briton took the chequered flag in the Hockenheim sunshine. I wanted to give you the opportunity fo driving a great racing car.         
	The safety car was deployed on lap 36 after the Toyota of Germanys Timo Glock suffered a dramatic high-speed suspension failure and slammed into the concrete wall backwards at the entrance to the straight. The driver was helped groggily from the wrecked car, with debris scattered across the track, and taken to the medical centre.         
	Massas appearance on the podium with him made it the first time two Brazilian drivers had stood in that position since Piquets father and namesake joined the late Ayrton Senna in the top three in 1991. (reuters)

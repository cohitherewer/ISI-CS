The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captains support for Champions Trophy
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Captains support for Champions Trophy
  - We are extremely focused on doing well again this year: Ponting       A STAFF REPORTER            Ricky Ponting                                 
	Calcutta: After the disappointment of the tri-series in Bangladesh, where his team thoroughly dominated the tournament only to lose to arch-rivals Pakistan in the final, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be banking on his teams consistent run in ODIs to bring home the champions trophy.         
	The Indian team did very well in limited-overs cricket in 2007-08. Winning the one-day series in Australia was a monumental achievement. Not only did we beat the World Cup winners, but also Sri Lanka, who were runner-up in the Caribbean, said the India captain. We would like to continue in the same vein and take the ICC Champions Trophy home with us to India, Dhoni said.         
	Meanwhile, crickets elite captains on Thursday threw their weight behind the ICC Champions Trophy 2008 that will be held in Pakistan this September, according to an ICC release.         
	Ricky Ponting, captain of defending champion Australia, said his side were already focused on retaining the trophy, the second most important tournament after the ICC Cricket World Cup.         
	Pontings sentiments were shared by the leaders of the other teams, including Pakistans Shoaib Malik and Graeme Smith of South Africa, who said the two-group, round-robin format meant every team would have to be on top of their game from the very first match.         
	The Champions Trophy is the number two one-day tournament on the calendar behind the ICC Cricket World Cup and it is for this reason that our players will ensure they are at the peak of their form to take on the worlds best in this format of the game, Ponting said.         
	We are particularly focused on performing well this year in the Champions Trophy in Pakistan and I am excited by the prospect of some new Australian players having the opportunity to be tested against the worlds best 50-over players.         
	[An Australian newspaper, meanwhile, has claimed that most of the leading Australian cricketers would pull out of the event if the ICC is adamant to host the elite tournament in Pakistan, says an agency report from Melbourne.         
	It is going to come down to the individuals decision, a member of the Australian team, currently touring the West Indies, told the daily.]         
	Malik said his team were ready to give their best to win the tournament on home turf. It is my dream to captain my country to victory in the ICC Champions Trophy on home soil and my team will be doing everything we can to convert this dream into reality, he said.         
	This is the biggest cricket event to come to Pakistan in more than a decade. I am sure that there will be a fantastic atmosphere for all the games and that the people of Pakistan will make it a happy and memorable event.         
	Malik said the tournament could be one of the most closely contested one for a long time. The fact that we beat India earlier this week, who showed what a good side they were when they beat Australia earlier this year, means that it will be very difficult to predict the outcome of matches, he said.         
	Graeme Smith said the new format of the tournament with the eight best teams in the world should make for a very exciting tournament.         
	Having won it once before (in 1998) we are obviously keen to do so again and it is important that we take the extra step because we have been in a lot of semi-finals without going to the final stage, Smith said.         
	West Indies captain Chris Gayle said with the last two ICC Champions Trophy tournaments being good events for his team, he wanted to carry forward the same momentum.         
	In 2004 it was great feeling to be part of the team which won that amazing final against England at The Oval. I will always remember that day and cherish those memories, he said.         
	This time around we will again be looking forward to the tournament and we are hoping that we can come out victorious and make all our supporters proud. It is a slightly different team this time around  a younger group of players  but the boys are really looking forward to the challenge of competing and pushing themselves to the limit.         
	England captain Paul Collingwood said his team were developing as a one-day side and were ready to make a big impact on the tournament as his players now had good knowledge about conditions in the Asian subcontinent.         
	He said: We are developing as a one-day side with some exciting new players coming through and I believe that this tournament will be a great opportunity for us to test ourselves against the best in the world.         
	We have come close to winning the Champions Trophy before and would love to go one better this time.         
	New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said: We see this as an important tournament.         
	It was the first major tournament that we won back in 2000 and we want to repeat that again this year in Pakistan.         
	Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardena said: Its the biggest event after the World Cup and it gives you the opportunity to test your skills with the best in the world.

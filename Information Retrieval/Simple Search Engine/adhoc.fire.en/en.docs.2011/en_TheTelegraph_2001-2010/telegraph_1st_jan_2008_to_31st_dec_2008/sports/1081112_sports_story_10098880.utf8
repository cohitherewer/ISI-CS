  - On his first day as an ex-cricketer, Former captain opens up 
          A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Nagpur: Sourav Ganguly spoke to The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon (before leaving for Calcutta), his first day as an ex-cricketer.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q When did it sink in that youre now a former India cricketer?         
	A Yesterday (Monday) itself... Im pretty happy being an ex-cricketer... That my career ended the way it did, with us beating the world champions and my getting runs, is what has made me happy...         
	Did you get emotional when getting off the Team India bus for the last time?         
	(Laughs) Not at all... Having been on so many team buses, for over a dozen years, I was actually glad to get off!         
	But you must have woken up feeling somewhat different?         
	Not really, except that I knew I wouldnt have to go to the ground, wouldnt have to train... Realised that Ive got time for myself and the family... I felt relaxed.         
	What are your plans for the next few days?         
	If I can, take a break from everything... Id like to stay relaxed and not worry about the clock.         
	You were the cynosure at Mondays team dinner at the Pride Hotel...         
	Oh, Id never seen the boys enjoy themselves so much... I cant tell you what all was said, but we had a blast... I was asked to make a speech, which I did standing on a chair... I thanked the boys for their love and support... Most had been a big part of my life for 12-13 years... I accepted Id miss them and wished them well... I wont ever again be with them as a teammate, but Im bound to meet them at some point or the other... It will remain a very special evening for me.         
	I believe Dona went around collecting your teammates autographs on a T-shirt. What did they write?         
	Dona was very active... (Adds laughing) She hadnt been as active during my career! In fact, I didnt know shed planned to get the autographs, she just took one of the T-shirts out of my bag.         
	Who wrote what?         
	Everybody had something special to say... Sachin (Tendulkar), Anil (Kumble), Rahul (Dravid), (VVS) Laxman... It was touching Teammates are a special lot.         
	Your fans havent been able to control themselves, but you continue to be so unemotional. How?         
	Ive been overwhelmed by messages and calls... I was so moved by the support at the (VCA) Stadium... Having said that, everything has to come to an end... For a sportsman, its his career... Ive enjoyed my innings and, as I told you the other day, dont have regrets except not winning the 2003 World Cup... Im lucky that my last series ended the way it did, both for the team and for me... The script couldve been different... We couldve lost the series and I may not have scored as many runs as I did (324)... People could then have forgotten me overnight... Im happy because everything worked out well... Happy that I could go out on a high.         
	Script with the perfect ending...         
	(Laughs) You could call it that.         
	Will you have a rethink just in case we dont do well against England and you yourself start to miss cricket?         
	No... Once the Test ended, Ive moved on in life... The announcement I made before the just-ended series stands... It wont change.         
	Did you expect such an emotional send-off?         
	No... Thats why the fans affection will be cherished by me for life.         
	Any message or call which struck a chord?         
	There have been so many But, yes, it was nice speaking to (former coach) John Wright He congratulated me for what Id achieved as an India cricketer. It was nice of him.         
	Going back to your last Test, one lasting memory will be of the moment when you stopped on the way back to the dressing room and looked at the replay of your dismissal for 85 (first innings)...         
	As I told you that day, I didnt want to leave the field... That couldve been my last innings and Id missed the chance to sign off the way Id begun Test cricket  with a hundred... I wouldnt have been as disappointed had I got out on, say, 45... I did get another innings, but fell first ball. You cant change destiny and my script as a batsman had to end with a duck... Today, theres nothing I can do about it... Hopefully, Ill be remembered for the debut hundred and some of my other innings, not that duck.         
	Looking back, what was the defining moment in your career?         
	My Test debut (Lords, 1996)... Changed me as a cricketer, changed me as a person... The confidence that hundred gave cant be explained in words.         
	What did you learn the most?         
	That its never over unless you yourself believe that its over.         
	The Board president (Shashank Manohar) invited you for a cup of tea this morning. What did he say?         
	It was a nice gesture from Mr Manohar... He thanked me for my services to Indian cricket and said that if I needed anything, hed be a call away... (After a pause) We didnt discuss anything about my possibly getting involved with Indian cricket in any manner... Today, obviously, was too soon for that.         
	Your message for fans...         
	(Emotionally) Im grateful for their support over the past many years... Theyve been a part of my success and Ive valued their support.         
	Anything for the emerging cricketers?         
	Make best use of your talent and, when you get to play for India, remember that Test cricket is the most important form.         
	Finally, one of your idols, Diego Maradona, is coming to Calcutta next month. Are you excited?         
	Absolutely... Hope I get to meet him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gibbs hails Rohit
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gibbs hails Rohit
                                Rohit Sharma    
	New Delhi: Rohit Sharma, the most successful batsman for Deccan Chargers in the ongoing IPL, Wednesday found an admirer in South African teammate Herschelle Gibbs, who believes the young batsman has a prosperous career ahead.         
	Rohit Sharma has really grabbed my attention by his performance in the IPL matches.         
	A great, prosperous career is lying ahead of this cricketer, who has shown good performance during the ongoing tournament, Gibbs said on being asked to name one promising young cricketer he has observed during the inaugural IPL.         
	The Mumbai batsman is the third highest run-getter in the tourney with 296 runs in nine matches at an average of 42.28.         
	Gibbs, who himself has managed just 46 runs in five appearances, was disappointed with his own show.         
	I am a little bit disappointed and frustrated as well with my performance so far. I am failing to execute some of my favourite shots, probably because I am running out of luck, he regretted.         
	The South African was highly impressed with the IPL concept, which he believes gives a chance to players to mingle with people from different traditions and cultures.         
	IPL helps you to make friends in the international cricket circuit and thats often more important than the game itself, he felt. (PTI)

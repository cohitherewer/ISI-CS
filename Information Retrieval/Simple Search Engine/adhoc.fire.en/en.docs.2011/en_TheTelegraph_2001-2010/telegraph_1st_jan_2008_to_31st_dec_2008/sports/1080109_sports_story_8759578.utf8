                                                Track not fit, says Usha 
            A STAFF REPORTER                                P.T. Usha at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium on Tuesday.   A Telegraph picture    
	Calcutta: Former Olympian P.T. Usha on Tuesday lashed out at the organisers of the 53rd National School Games saying that the Rabindra Sarobar track was not fit for any competition.         
	You cannot have a race on this track as the competitors will get injured, Usha said. The former sprint queen is accompanying 11 athletes from her academy  Usha School of Athletics  representing Kerala.         
	I though the meet would be held at the Salt Lake Stadium. But on reaching here, I learnt that the meet would be held here, which is not fit for any competition, she added.         
	According to an official, a Bengal athlete Rakhi Mondal fell down while competing in the 400 metres and sustained injuries. She had to be rushed to hospital.         
	The Payyoli Express pinned hopes on her trainees to perform well at the 2012 London Olympics. I hope one of my trainees will go on to win a medal in London, she said, adding Tintu Luka is a bright prospect.         
	She, however, doesnt want to get into administration. I would rather like to pass on the knowledge to the juniors, Usha signed off.         
	Meanwhile, Papiya Khatun and Suibani Bhumij of Bengal bagged silver and bronze medals respectively in the girls U-19 long jump event. Bengal earned another silver in javelin through, courtesy Anita Gurung (U-19).         
	However the day belonged Delhis Kanika Kumari who set a meet record (50.83m) in the U-19 hammer throw.

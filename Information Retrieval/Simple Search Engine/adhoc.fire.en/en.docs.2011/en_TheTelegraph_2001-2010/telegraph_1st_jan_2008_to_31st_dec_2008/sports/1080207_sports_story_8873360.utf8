	New Delhi: In a blow to Indias chances in the Thomas and Uber Cup qualifiers this month, the national camp for the preparation of the prestigious tournaments scheduled in Goa from Friday has been called off due to unavailability of shuttlecocks.    
	Badminton Association of India (BAI) laid the blame squarely on the Sports Authority of India and the ministry, saying the association has been running pillar to post for the last five months to get the shuttlecocks in time but SAI has failed to provide them.    
	The top shuttlers who had reached the venue were asked to pack off and head home.         
	Tel Aviv: Israels most senior sports administrator criticised tennis player Shahar Peer of unsporting conduct for encouraging the crowd to put off opponents during last weekends Fed Cup tie against Russia.    
	International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Alex Gilady said Israels top player and world No. 17 Peer had incited the partisan home crowd to try to distract the opposition.    
	The crowd behaved this way because it was incited ... by Shahar Peer, I think this was unsporting conduct, Gilady said.    
	Fed Cup holders Russia won the tie 4-1 but some spectators in the capacity crowd of over 5,000 tried to unsettle the Russian trio of Maria Sharapova, Dinara Safina and Anna Chakvetadze.    
	Gilady said he had sent a letter of apology for the crowds behaviour to Russian Fed Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, who is also an IOC member.

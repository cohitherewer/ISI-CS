	 Haddin is better than Gilly: Ian  
	Melbourne: Former Australian skipper Ian Chappell has said that the team will not feel the absence of retired stumper Adam Gilchrist as his replacement Brad Haddin is a better wicketkeeper.  
	Haddin became the 400th Test player of his country in Australias first Test against the West Indies that started in Jamaica on Thursday. I think Haddin will improve the standard of wicketkeeping from what we have seen from Gilchrist in the last couple of years, because there is no doubt that (Gilchrists) wicketkeeping form was heading south and heading south fairly quickly, Chappell was quoted as saying in an Australian daily.

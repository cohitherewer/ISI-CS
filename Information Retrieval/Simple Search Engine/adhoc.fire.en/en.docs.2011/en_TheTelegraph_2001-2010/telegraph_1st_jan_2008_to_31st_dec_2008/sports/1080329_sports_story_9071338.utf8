	Calcutta: Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh joined overnight leaders Viktor Laznicka of the Czech Repulic and Ngyuen Anh Dung of Philippines in the lead after the fifth round of the Calcutta International Open Grandmasters Tournament at the Alekhine Chess club on Friday.         
	Rahman registered a hard-earned win over second seed Smbat Lputian of Armenia. The leaders have 4.5 points each.         
	On top board, Laznicka and Dung were satisfied to settle for a draw in 21 moves to retain their position at the top.         
	Rahman opted for an irregular variation in a Reti opening against Lputian which took the game along lesser known lines. Rahmans aggressive play in the middle game forced his opponents king in the open in a queen and opposite bishop ending. Lputian resigned when faced with the option of loss of a piece or checkmate.         
	In an exciting encounter between GM Koneru Kumpy and city-based GM Sandipan Chanda, Humpy obtained a slight opening advantage in a semi-slav defence. But the latter created enough threats on the kingside to expose her king. The game was eventually drawn by perpetual checks in a position where neither player had any prospects.         
	Local IM Saptarshi Roy caused a major upset by defeating GM Vladimir Dobrov of Russia . In a Slav defence, Dobrov sacrificed 3 pawns for an attack but went astray in the resulting complicated middle game. Thereafter, Saptarshis extra material decided the fate of the game. After the game, Dobrov said, It was an interesting game and I had a fine attack brewing up. I should have played g4 instead of a4 on move 24 which would have given me an excellent game         
	GM Dibyendu Barua turned the tables on Vikramaditya Kamble from a clearly inferior position to win a piece and the game in the end-game.         
	 Arghyadip Das, however, suffered a setback in his quest for his 2nd GM norm, as he went down to GM David Alberto in a French defence.

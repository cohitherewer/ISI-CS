The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB keeps the lid on Asif report
                                                                                                                                                                                                     PCB keeps the lid on Asif report
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board is tight-lipped about the public prosecutors report they have received from Dubai on the circumstances leading to the detention of Mohammed Asif in Dubai last month.         
	A senior official, however, confirmed that the report did mention that the authorities while detaining Asif at the airport had found a small quantity of contraband item on him.         
	We are still going through the details of the report but yes it was a contraband item. We have summoned him on Wednesday to face the fact-finding committee of the board for this case, Nadeem Akram said.         
	Akram is director administration in the board and also a member of the fact-finding panel formed to look into Asifs detention in Dubai. Sources said the contraband item found on Asif was opium.         
	However, sources said the good news for Asif was that he apparently had not used opium when detained at the airport as his urine samples came negative in tests carried out by the Dubai police.         
	We want to settle this matter as soon as possible because we need to get out of these controversies and get these players to start concentrating on cricket, Akram said.

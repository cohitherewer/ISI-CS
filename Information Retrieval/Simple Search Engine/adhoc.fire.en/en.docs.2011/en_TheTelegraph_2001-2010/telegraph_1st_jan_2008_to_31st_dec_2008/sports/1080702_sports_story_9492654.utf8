                                                                                                                                                                                                     He threatened to kill me
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chandigarh: Manpreet Singh Gonys mother, Mohinder Kaur, has charged the India pacer with ill treatment at the behest of his wife Mandeep and mother-in-law Bialo.         
	Before leaving for Pakistan, he came to me and said now that he has become famous he would teach a lesson to both me and my husband. Others who were with him were giving me menacing looks, Mohinder alleged.         
	[At a news conference, however, Mohinder alleged that Gony had actually threatened to kill her.]         
	Gony is the youngest of three sons and has been living separately with his in-laws since his marriage two years ago.         
	According to Gonys mother, the problem began soon after Mandeep had a son.         
	Gonys son died due to a heart problem at a Delhi hospital when he was 16 days old. On their return, Gony and Mandeep began accusing me of witchcraft.         
	My other two sons are married and have children. How can I be responsible for his sons death? I am a mother too, she wept.         
	Asked why now she was going public about Gonys behaviour when their relation had soured much earlier, Mohinder said she felt scared when Gony threatened her just before leaving for Pakistan.         
	He said he has become very rich and could do anything he wanted... His behaviour was very scary. The only thing he did not do was to hit me. I have been having nightmares since, Mohinder said.         
	Asked why she was not lodging a police complaint, she replied, this will spoil my sons career.         
	Gonys wife Mandeep refused to comment.

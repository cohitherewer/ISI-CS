                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dravid: I was never short on confidence
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Graeme Swann celebrates the wicket of Sachin Tendulkar on Day II of the second Test at the PCA Stadium in Mohali on Saturday. (PTI)                           
	Mohali: A visibly relieved Rahul Dravid on Saturday thanked everyone who supported him during the difficult times and said it was more important for him than scoring runs.         
	I was surprised that so many people wanted me to do well. I mean if there was any positive out of the phase, this was it, Dravid told reporters after scoring his 26th Test century.         
	Its during this time that you realise that so many people want you to do well. Some of the people didnt need to do that but still they supported me. I felt as if so many people have gone through the journey with me. It was more important than scoring runs, he added.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Do you feel relieved?         
	Definitely. Im relieved and its nice to be contributing again. It has been a tough year for me, nothing has been easy. Its nice to make important contributions.         
	You didnt show much emotion after completing your hundred. Was it like trying to make a statement?         
	(Laughs) Not really. I didnt try to make any statement. I was definitely happy and relieved. I guess Im bit old and wise, I dont jump around even when Im excited. It was a combination of both relief and joy.         
	You have scored 26 Test centuries. How important was this knock?         
	Its a quite significant knock, considering the form I was in coming into the match. Its one of the most significant hundreds I scored and I now just hope we go on to win this match.         
	There was lot of criticism about your poor form.         
	Yes. I know. Naturally, there will be something about me. After all, I did not play great cricket for the past few months. I was not scoring runs. Its only natural that people would speculate and raise questions about me. It was very tough time personally. But then, criticism is part and parcel of cricket.         
	Were you getting disappointed for your string of poor scores?         
	Not really. I was determined. I was surprised that so many people wanted me to do well. I mean if there was any positive out of the phase, this was it. Its during this time that you realise that so many people want you to do well. Some of the people didnt need to do that but still they supported me. I felt as if so many people have gone through the journey with me. It was more important than scoring runs.         
	How did you manage to make this comeback?         
	See I was never short of confidence. In the last few months, including the series against Australia, I felt I was playing well, though I dont have the runs to prove that. There are certain ways I judge that  like the way I bat in the nets, my position while batting, direction I play the ball in Teammates, (coach) Gary (Kirsten) and other people said everything was right about my batting. I too knew that in my gut but only the runs were not coming. I knew it was just a matter of going out and spending some time. I knew I will turn around and it has happened.         
	Did you look at some of your previous knocks?         
	I tried everything. Looked at a video of some of the good knocks and recreated the emotions. But in the last two series, I only enjoyed my sessions in the nets and tried to be as uncomplicated as possible. I decided to trust my instinct and just watch the ball.         
	How did you build this innings?         
	As the innings went on, I grew in confidence and my feet started moving. I also could pick the ball better. It was a good testing spell by the English bowlers and we were lucky to come through that. Yesterday, Gautam (Gambhir) played a very good knock. He took the pressure off me by scoring at a quick rate and rotating the strike. I hope our (314-run) stand is potentially match-winning. We have set the platform to push for a win.         
	There was a suggestion to send you down the batting order         
	I dont know since no one spoke to me about that. I believe they had full faith on me. I knew the pressure was on me because I was not scoring runs. Personally, I am always happy to contribute for the team in whichever position I am asked to bat.

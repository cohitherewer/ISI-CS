                                                                                                                                                                                                       McGraths wife loses battle with cancer
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            A file picture of Glenn McGrath with wife Jane                           
	Calcutta: Jane McGrath, wife of former Australian fast bowler Glenn, passed away at their home in Sydney on Sunday after a long battle with cancer, Cricket Australia (CA) announced. She was 42.         
	Jane died peacefully with her husband and their children by her side after her health deteriorated in the past week following surgery in March.         
	It is with deep sadness that the family and friends of Jane McGrath, beloved wife of former Australian cricketer Glenn and loving mother of James and Holly, must announce she passed away at her home this morning, said a CA statement.         
	The couple, who co-founded the McGrath Foundation to support breast cancer patients, were recognised for their charity work earlier this year when they were appointed as Members of the Order of Australia.         
	Janes courageous struggle touched all Australians, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said in a statement. Jane was an inspiration whose legacy will continue to benefit so many others.         
	Jane was first diagnosed with breast cancer during Australias Ashes tour of England in 1997, then bone cancer in her hip in 2003 but made a full recovery both times. She was then diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour in 2006, prompting McGrath to take eight months off cricket while she was undergoing radiotherapy.         
	He returned to the team later that year to help Australia regain the Ashes from England and win the World Cup for a third time in succession before announcing he was retiring despite still being at the top of his game.         
	Jane was well-known, loved and admired throughout Australian cricket and was one of the most respected and admired members of the Australian cricket team family group during Glenn McGraths playing days, said CA chief executive James Sutherland in a statement.         
	Cricket South Africa also extended its heart-felt condolences to McGraths family.

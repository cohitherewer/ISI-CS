The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fisichella is confident
                                                   Fisichella is confident
                      
	Sepang: Force India will bank on new aerodynamic parts and Giancarlo Fisichellas experience to make a mark in Sundays Malaysian Formula One Grand Prix at the Sepang international circuit here.         
	Fisichella, oozing confidence, said: As we went out very early in Australia, we could not demonstrate how much closer we now are, relative to the other teams. The vjm01 feels more consistent and stable, and now we have some new aero parts coming for this race. I think we will take another step forward.         
	I have good memories of the race here too. I won in 2006 with Renault and, although we will not be in that position now, I do think we should be able to put in a good performance, said the Italian.

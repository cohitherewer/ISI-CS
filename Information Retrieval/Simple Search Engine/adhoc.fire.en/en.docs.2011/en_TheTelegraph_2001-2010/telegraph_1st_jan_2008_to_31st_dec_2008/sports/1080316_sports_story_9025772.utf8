            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Manoj Tiwary is determined to prove his credentials, using his experience of sharing the dressing room with the Sachin Tendulkars Down Under.         
	The 22-year-old from Bengal says he is keen on seizing the opportunity and impressing the selectors as a Delhi Daredevils player. It is a challenge for me to play for Delhi and I am looking forward to playing under Virender Sehwags leadership, He said..         
	I had got a chance in Australia but I could not grab it. Now, I will do everything possible in the domestic circuit to get another opportunity. The rest depends on the selectors.         
	Tiwarys first call-up, which had come during the Bangaldesh tour last year, ended in sheer disappointment as he got injured. He was called up in Australia as a cover to the injured Yuvraj Singh, but failed to impress in his debut match.         
	I have learned a lot from the Australia tour. It also provided me with the opportunity to share the dressing room with Tendulkar who is my hero, said Tiwary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Testing time ahead for visitors against spin
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Testing time ahead for visitors against spin
    - Australia still trail by 264 runs at the end of day II                   Piyush Chawla and Subramaniam Badrinath celebrate a wicket at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium   in Hyderabad on Friday. (PTI)                                 
	Hyderabad: Piyush Chawla laid bare Australias utter discomfiture against quality spin and the gingerly visitors fumbled and faltered their way to 191 for four wickets on day two of their warm-up match against Board Presidents XI here on Friday.         
	The Aussie top-order developed cold feet against Chawla and their free-scoring flair was completely non-existent as they finished the day still 264 behind the 455 runs which Board Presidents XI had scored in their first essay.         
	Incidentally, Ricky Pontings men got at least three lbw reprieves, but for which things could have been even worse.         
	Michael Hussey (54), one of the beneficiaries of the reprieves, and Brad Haddin (34) were in the middle when stumps were drawn and they have the onerous task of bridging the gap when play resumes on Saturday.         
	Earlier, Board Presidents XI added 84 runs to their overnight score of 371 for six before folding. Both overnight batsmen Parthiv Patel (62) and Irfan Pathan (56) duly completed their half-centuries before the side lost last three wickets over a 10-ball span to be 455 all out in their first essay.         
	Matthew Hayden (20) led Australias riposte but was lucky to get a reprieve when umpire Shavir Tarapore turned down Manpreet Gonys appeal for what looked like a plumb leg before dismissal.         
	Hayden responded by hitting two boundaries off a Pathan over before poking at one and the left-arm seamer was ecstatic, having the last laugh in his duel against him.         
	Simon Katich (15) similarly benefited from the doubt in umpire Amish Sahebas mind but he could make the most of the opportunity and fell to Pragyan Ojha.         
	Operating in tandem, the spinners stifled the visitors and Piyush Chawla (2/46) did everything to make life miserable for a clueless Ricky Ponting. He stepped out twice to hit Ojha over long on ropes and breathe easy but Chawla ensured he did not bloom further.         
	The leggie bamboozled him with a googly that crashed through Pontings gate to rattle his timbers at the stroke of tea. Chawla went on to scalp Pontings deputy as well, trapping Michael Clarke (18) on the other side of the break.         
	For them, the welcome grit came from Hussey and Haddin who gamely hung around. Husseys unbeaten 54 came off 136 balls with seven hits to the fence and a six.

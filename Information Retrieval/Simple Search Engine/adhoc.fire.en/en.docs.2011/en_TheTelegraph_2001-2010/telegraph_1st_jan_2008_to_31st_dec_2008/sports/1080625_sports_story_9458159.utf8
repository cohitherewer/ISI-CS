The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ballack refuses to predict winner
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ballack refuses to predict winner
                      
	Tenero: Germany captain Michael Ballack made such a mess of his pre-Euro 2008 tips that he is unwilling to predict anything other than an exhausting battle in Wednesdays semi-final against Turkey.         
	The Germany captain said in an interview before the tournament that Italy, France, Portugal and Croatia were his favourites for the title. None of them have reached the last four and he is taking nothing for granted against clear underdogs Turkey.         
	I admit I was utterly wrong with my predictions, Ballack told a news conference on Tuesday. But the only important thing is that we have a major chance to go through to the final. Whoever you face at this stage youre going to get an even match.

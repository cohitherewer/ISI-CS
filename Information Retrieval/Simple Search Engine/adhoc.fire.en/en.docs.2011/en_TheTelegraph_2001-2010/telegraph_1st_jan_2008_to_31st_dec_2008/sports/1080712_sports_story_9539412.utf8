The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diwakar brace in India win
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Diwakar brace in India win
                      
	Hyderabad: Diwakar Rams brace helped defending champion India beat Japan 2-0 in a group A match at the junior Asia Cup meet at the Gachibowli Hockey Stadium on Friday.         
	Ram netted the first goal as early as in the sixth minute of the match and then doubled the lead in the 41st minute, both through penalty corners.         
	However, the hosts short-corner conversion was not up to the mark as they could capitalise on only two out of the five chances they have earned in the entire match.         
	Although, India bagged full points from the tie, their performance against a lowly Japanese side was a lacklustre one. And coach A.K. Bansal was quick to express his disappointment, adding that the players need to pull up their socks in the remaining matches of the tournament.         
	Considering their performance on Friday, India will face a daunting task against formidable Malaysian side on Saturday.         
	Earlier in the day, other favourites, Pakistan and South Korea, had easy outings against minnows Oman and South Korea, while the match between Malaysia and Singapore ended in a thrilling 2-2 draw. Pakistan thumped Oman 5-1, while South Korea routed Bangladesh 8-0.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     JSCA wants Keenan at its disposal
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In an unprecedented move, all the 21 affiliates of the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) have dashed off a letter to Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman, requesting him to make Keenan Stadium available for the development of the game in the state.         
	The Keenan was synonymous with cricket in undivided Bihar and has been the focal point of the game in Jharkhand.         
	In the letter, the association has offered to upgrade Keenan into a modern international cricket complex. It mentions that Tata Steel denied permission to conduct combined trials of Jharkhand and Bihar in April 2007 and May 2008 at the Keenan, besides not granting the go ahead for selection to MRF Pace Foundation and conducting local and national tournaments.         
	When contacted, Sanjeev Singh, sports-in-charge of Tata Steel, refused to elaborate the reasons. The Keenan is the property of Tata Steel and it is up to us to utilise it in the best possible way. No one has the authority to question that, he said.         
	Amitabh Chaudhary, president of JSCA, said: Its up to them to do whatever they want JSCA is in the process of building its own stadium as per the Board directive.

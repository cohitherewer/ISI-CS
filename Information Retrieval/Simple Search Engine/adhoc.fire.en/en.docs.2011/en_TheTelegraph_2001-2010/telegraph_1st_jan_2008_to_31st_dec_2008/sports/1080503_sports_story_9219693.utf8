            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: Three wins after two losses have given the Kings XI Punjab the confidence of defeating the Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday. They have world class players but we will execute our strategy, said Kings XI coach Tom Moody on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	About Saturdays game plan         
	We are very positive of doing well. We are confident after three straight wins and getting better with each game. The way Shaun (Marsh) played in the last game has given a fillip to us. I am not at all concerned about the Kolkata Knight Riders They have world class players but we have a plan to execute.         
	His comments on Shaun Marshs innings         
	Its not surprising. He is one of Australias leading young cricketer and has a very promising future. His performance is not a surprise for us.         
	Secret behind Kings XIs turnaround in the tournament         
	There is no mystery behind the turnaround... Its hard work and an ability to believe in oneself. Playing away from home does not matter too much for us We would like our winning spree to continue.         
	Strengths and weaknesses of the Knight Riders         
	In the Twenty20 cricket every opponent is tough. It all depends on using the conditions to benefit us. We have been able to use the conditions to our benefit.         
	Brett Lees absence         
	We have players who will get a chance to prove their worth. James Hopes is now fit and has been cleared for selection for tomorrows match.

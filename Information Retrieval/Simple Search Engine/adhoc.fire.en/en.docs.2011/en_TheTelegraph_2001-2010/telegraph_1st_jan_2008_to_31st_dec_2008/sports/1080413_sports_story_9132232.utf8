	London: Andy Roddick and James Blake gave the US a 2-0 lead over France in their Davis Cup quarter final on Friday.         
	Roddick fired 30 aces en route to a 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 win over Michael Llodra in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.         
	James Blake extended the lead for the Americanswhen he beat Paul-Henri Mathieu 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 in the second rubber.         
	Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer gave Spain a 2-0 lead over Germany in their quarter final tie in Bremen.         
	The other last-eight ties were evenly poised after Argentina and Sweden split the opening days singles and Marat Safin produced a stunning comeback win for Russia before the Czech Republic levelled the tie.         
	Nadal overcame jet-lag to beat Nicolas Kiefer 7-6, 6-0, 6-3, while German number one Philipp Kohlschreiber visibly tired during his 6-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 defeat by Ferrer.         
	Triple French Open champion Nadal, who has had trouble sleeping since flying in from Miami at the start of the week, made a sluggish start but edged an 88-minute first set 7-5 on the tiebreak and went on to win comfortably.

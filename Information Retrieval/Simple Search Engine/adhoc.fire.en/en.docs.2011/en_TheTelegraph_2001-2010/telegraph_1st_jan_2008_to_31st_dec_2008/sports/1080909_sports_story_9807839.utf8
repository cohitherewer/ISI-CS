The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand is to meet Ivanchuk 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Anand is to meet Ivanchuk 
                      
	Bilbao (Spain): World champion Viswanathan Anand will be under pressure to win when he comes out for the sixth round game against Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine after the rest day in the Bilbao Grand Slam here.         
	Anand hit a low against Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and lost in the fourth round. Besides, the Indian ace has only managed four draws which puts him on 4 points in the soccer-like scoring system, that gives three points for a win and one for draw, being used first time ever in a high-category tournament.         
	But, according to the experts, Anand is perhaps reserving his best form for his forthcoming world championship match against Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, a month later and thats probably the reason for his mediocre show thus far in the biggest prize money tournament ever.

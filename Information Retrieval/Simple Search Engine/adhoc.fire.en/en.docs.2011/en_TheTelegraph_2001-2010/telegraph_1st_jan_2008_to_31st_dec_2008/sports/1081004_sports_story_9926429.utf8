The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anil, Bhajji big threats: Chawla
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Anil, Bhajji big threats: Chawla
                      
	Hyderabad: Having just exposed Australias frailties against quality spin, chubby leg-spinner Piyush Chawla on Friday predicted Ricky Pontings men would struggle against Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh in the forthcoming Test series.         
	Chawla tied the visitors in tangles and made them look laden-footed with his guiles and variations.         
	He tormented Ponting before ending his misery with a googly that completely foxed the Australian captain and rattled his timbers.         
	The baby-faced leggie predicted a tough time for the visitors in the forthcoming series. Both Anil Bhai and Harbhajan are great bowlers and in good form. Its not going to be easy for the Australian batsmen in the Test series, the youngster said.         
	It was a gem of a delivery that got rid of Ponting but Chawla played it down and said: I have played against him and seen him so many times. I just wanted to pitch the ball in the right area. My stock ball is the wrong one, I bowled it and got the wicket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | M.S. Dhoni revels in pressure
                                                   M.S. Dhoni revels in pressure
                      
	Ranchi: Appreciated by former greats for his on-field composure during the recently concluded tri-series in Australia, Indias ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said he revels in pressure and stays calm to instil confidence in the bowlers.         
	Well, tension is omnipresent. It is tough at the international level. I dont think it is possible to play international cricket without pressure, Dhoni said.         
	A captain, he felt, needed to stay calm to send out positive signals to bowlers who are under constant pressure.         
	One has to stay calm on the pitch, particularly to relieve the bowlers. If a bowler finds his captain in tension, then it will have a negative impact on him, Dhoni said.         
	Dhoni was responding to a query on how he felt about praises being heaped on him by former captains from India and Australia such as Steve Waugh, Adam Gilchrist, Kim Hughes, Ajit Wadekar and Dilip Vengsarkar.

                                                    San Siro is ideal stage for Arsenals rescue act

      Arsene Wenger 
             
	Arsenal travel to Milan with their season on the brink and for this they largely have only themselves to blame. And it is not hard to see where they first ran into difficulties. 
    
	You can trace a lot back to that Saturday night at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the FA Cup. To me, they appeared lacklustre and gave the impression that they almost did not want to be there. 
    
	It was exactly the kind of performance that Arsenal simply could not afford to give because when you are going for the title and the Champions League, momentum is everything. And since returning from Old Trafford, Arsenal have run rapidly out of momentum; they have dropped points against Birmingham and Aston Villa and produced a poor result against AC Milan at home. 
    
	It will be difficult for Arsenal to get that impetus back. If you are a great side, you have to show greatness in everything you do. If you are a club fighting on a number of fronts, like Liverpool in 1984 or Manchester United in 1999, you want the games to come thick and fast; you do not want prolonged periods of rest. 
    
	In all my years at Liverpool, I never heard anyone tell us that we were tired for the simple reason that if you tell a footballer he is tired, he will be. When Arsenals season imploded this time last year, Arsene Wenger blamed FA Cup replays and said he would not take the competition as seriously again  and that attitude may have transmitted itself to his team at Old Trafford, with disastrous consequences. 
    
	Sir Alex Ferguson will tell you that one of the contributing factors to Manchester United winning the Treble was that the games came so quickly his players did not have time to consider the enormity of what they were about to achieve. 
    
	For a football team to fight and win on several fronts is an incredible, enjoyable journey and the players will not want to be rested  they will want to be in the thick of everything. And if you are beaten, you pick yourself up and start again, which is something Arsenal are not good at. 
    
	When Wenger says that mid-table, middle-of-the-road sides go out with an express plan to kick Arsenal and physically intimidate them, he is merely stating the obvious tactics used against any top team. 
    
	They were the sort of tactics the great Liverpool sides of the 1970s and 1980s had to put up with and they are the sort of tactics Manchester United have dealt with for 15 years. When I was at Liverpool, teams came at us with the intensity of a cup final and how many times do you think Cristiano Ronaldo is kicked in a match? 
    
	If you are a manager facing Arsenal, Chelsea or Manchester United, your instructions to your players will be the same; get men behind the ball, disrupt their rhythm and put your foot in. 
    
	Under the circumstances, you might think that the San Siro is the last place Arsenal need to be on Tuesday, facing the European champions. But it might be the best place of all. 
    
	Great teams are those that have the ability to fight back in adversity and in their manager, their players and their wonderful style of football Arsenal have all the ingredients of greatness. The San Siro would be a fabulous stage on which to prove it.

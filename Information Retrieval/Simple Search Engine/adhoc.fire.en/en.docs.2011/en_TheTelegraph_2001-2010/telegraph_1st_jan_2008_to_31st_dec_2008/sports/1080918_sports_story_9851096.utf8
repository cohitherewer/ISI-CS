The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson cries foul
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ferguson cries foul
                      
	Sir Alex Ferguson has accused Keith Hackett, the general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Board, of overruling referee Mark Halsey in order to save Chelsea captain John Terry from a three-match suspension for his dismissal for serious foul play against Manchester City.         
	Terry was spared a suspension after a FA hearing upheld Chelseas claim of wrongful dismissal. This prompted Ferguson, to suggest that it was Hacketts intervention that led to Terrys reprieve.         
	Ferguson said: I do not understand how this has happened. If it had been Manchester United, Keith Hackett would not have done this.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

                                                                                                                                                                                                     PCB chief thanks BCCI for support
                      
	Karachi: Relieved with the ICC decision not to shift Champions Trophy out ofthe country, Pakistan Cricket Board chief Nasim Ashraf on Thursday thanked the BCCI for throwing its weight behind PCB.         
	The BCCI helped us a lot in our efforts to keep the event in Pakistan. They supported us a lot and they took the stand of showing total confidence in our security arrangements for the Asia Cup and the Champions Trophy, Ashraf said.         
	While top cricketers of Australia, New Zealand, England and South Africa are apprehensive about the security situation in the volatile country, BCCI has all along been reiterating the Asian bloc stance to have it in Pakistan.         
	Calling it a unanimous decision, Ashraf said, we deserved to host the event as the security consultants had also given us an A grading for the way we organised the Asia Cup. It showed we were capable of holding a big event.         
	I am thankful to all members including India and South Africa who supported us and understood our position, he added.         
	The following is what others had to say (alphabetically):         
	ZAHEER ABBAS: There was a lot of concern over whether we would be able to host the event but now that the ICC has decided in our favour we should go all out to ensure that it is the best possible and safest event hosted in Pakistan. The Champions Trophy would help boost the sport in Pakistan as for a long time people were unhappy that not many top teams were touring Pakistan.         
	SHOAIB MALIK: I have always said that Pakistan is a safe country to host any cricket team. And even our own team gets the best possible security in Pakistan. I would advise the teams to leave the security arrangements to the boards and experts and concentrate on their cricket.

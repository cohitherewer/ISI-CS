The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sanjay Jagdale tipped to be joint secretary
                                                                                                                                                                                             Sanjay Jagdale tipped to be joint secretary
  - Tripuras Arindam Ganguly set to be vice-president from East, Rajeev Shukla to head BCCI finance committee       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Sanjay Jagdale                            
	Calcutta: Sanjay Jagdale, Centrals man on the outgoing senior selection committee, is tipped to be the next joint secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	The offer has been made and were confident that Jagdale will accept it, a key member of the ruling group told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Jagdale couldnt be reached for a comment, but somebody close to him suggested he would give his consent in a couple of days.         
	The lanky one-time allrounder, who played a fair bit of first-class cricket, is the Madhya Pradesh associations secretary.         
	Punjabs Mohinder Pandove, the current joint secretary, is going to be the next treasurer as the one in that chair for the past three years, N. Srinivasan, will succeed Niranjan Shah as secretary.         
	Shahs term ends at the September 27-28 AGM and its quite likely that he will get a position of importance either in the Indian Premier League or in a special committee to oversee preparations for the 2011 World Cup.         
	Meanwhile, Tripuras Arindam Ganguly is set to be the vice-president from East. Hed been favoured to get the position in 2006 itself, but MP Rajeev Shukla got himself elected.         
	The influential Shukla (who heads UP), one learns, will become the finance committee chairman. Its a key post, but hardly glamorous.         
	As the vice-president from Central, Shashank Manohar, is the next BCCI president, the vacancy there will be filled by Lalit Modi, vice-president from North.         
	Modi heads the Rajasthan association, an affiliated unit from Central, but that didnt stop him from becoming a vice-president from another zone.         
	Strange, yes, but Modi can turn around and say he didnt set a precedent.         
	Significantly, its as good as confirmed that Delhis Arun Jaitley, another MP, will take Modis place. It will be a comeback for Jaitley, who is highly respected across the BCCI.         
	Where West is concerned, either Barodas Chirayu Amin will continue or he will be replaced by Maharashtras Ajay Shirke. Its not clear whether Goas Dayanand Narvekar will remain the vice-president from South.         
	The South issue should be sorted out in the next few days, the ruling group member pointed out.

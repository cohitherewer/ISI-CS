The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Windies openers hold fort vs NZ
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Windies openers hold fort vs NZ
                      
	Wellington: Openers Chris Gayle and Sewnarine Chattergoon survived a tricky session just before stumps for the West Indies to draw even with New Zealand after the third day of the rain-affected opening Test in Dunedin on Saturday.         
	The Windies finished the day at 39 without loss in reply to New Zealands first innings total of 365.         
	Gayle was not out on 29 with a shaky-looking Chattergoon lucky to still be there on nine after a number of near-misses and a desperately close lbw decision in his favour.         
	The West Indies pace attack had earlier bowled with aggression and discipline to restrict New Zealand, who had started the day at 226 for four and were looking for a big total to force an unlikely result.         
	Play was disrupted by a waterlogged pitch but eventually got underway, with New Zealand batsmen Jesse Ryder and Brendon McCullum looking untroubled against the West Indies seamers.

                                                   Very disappointing: Lee

      A CORRESPONDENT
           
	Brisbane: Australian speedster Brett Lee was disappointed after his seventh five-wicket haul in ODIs went in vain. Rain abandoned Sundays fixture at the Gabba. It was a disappointing finish to the match. It needed a good fight from us to get home from there, Lee told reporters after the match. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
    
	On leading the Australian attack 
    
	It all comes down to knowing my own bowling better. I have matured on and off the field. I have played a lot of matches, and I have realised that you cant take your experience lightly. I have got the opportunity to lead the Australian attack, and I have enjoyed the extra responsibility. I have also been very patient. Patience is the one thing that has got me wickets. I have learnt when to bowl quick and when to cut down on pace. 
    
	On the fresh fast bowling attack fielded by Austraila 
    
	Its not nice that we havent got Shaun (Tait) to pick from. But we have got a great bowling squad including (Stuart) Clark and Ashley Noffke, who bowled very well. The talent is around and weve got heaps of depth. 
    
	On his first five-wicket haul at Gabba 
    
	I am really pleased with the way the ball is coming out of my hand. It was very special to get my first five-for at the Gabba, five-fors dont happen very often in ODI cricket. 
    
	On his thoughts about the match 
    
	It was a disappointing finish to the match. It needed a good fight from us to get home from there. With our batting we would have had a good chance. It was disappointing for us, it was disappointing for them and it was disappointing for all the fans. It was a no-win situation. I thought we bowled very well to reduce a quality batting line-up to a low score. I am sure if we had put our heads down, we would have got very close to the victory target, but the way they bowled and with Sreesanth picking up key wickets and steaming in, it would have been a great game. 
    
	On his views about the Indian youngsters 
    
	I havent played a lot against many of these guys. With people like (Rahul) Dravid and (Sourav) Ganguly, you always have plans in place, you find a certain way to bowl to them. With these guys, its almost like making those plans on actual cricket days. Twenty20 is too hard to judge a batsmans form by, you are trying to hit every ball out of the park. Its too early to tell, it was just one game today (Sunday). It sure looks like we will be playing against them a fair bit this summer, by the end we will have a better idea. 
    
	On Sachin Tendulkars dismissal 
    
	It was a different way of getting a wicket, but you are always happy to see Sachin walking back. There was a lot more carry in the wicket than at the MCG. The short ball can be a defensive ball, but it also gives you the chance to take wickets if used properly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Force India flay Lewis gesture 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Force India flay Lewis gesture 
                      
	New Delhi: Lewis Hamiltons angry gestures towards Giancarlo Fisichella in the Bahrain Grand Prix has irked Force Indias chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne, who said it was completely unnecessary on the McLaren drivers part.         
	Hamilton had a poor start in the third race of the season and a series of errors in Bahrain saw the Briton lagging behind Force Indias Fisichella, who ran a superb race there, gaining six places  most by any driver  in the process.         
	Hamilton trailed Fisichella for three laps before slipstreaming ahead and the Briton, the moment he overtook, gave vent to his frustration by shaking his fist at the Italian.         
	Fisichella, however, had the last laugh as he finished 12th, just ahead of his illustrious opponent.         
	Gascoyne, however, is not ready to forget the gesture. I dont know why he did that, he told a Swiss publication.         
	Fisichella was fighting with him for position, and he cant expect to just be let past. The gesture was totally unnecessary, so it was especially good to be in front of him at the end, said Gascoyne.         
	Incidentally, former world champion Niki Lauda too was unimpressed by Hamilton and said instead of getting better, the youngster has looked ragged so far this season. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky hits out at Sunny
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ricky hits out at Sunny
                      
	Melbourne: Ricky Ponting has lashed out at legendary Indian Sunil Gavaskar and other former players for often blaming the Australian team for on-field confrontations, saying the Indian opener was not an angel.         
	I know that over the past 10 years, probably longer, a notion has developed that the Australian team walks out onto the field intent on getting in faces and having a few words... Unfortunately, as soon as a spectator or a commentator spots one of my team chipping on an opponent, they assume it is a pre-meditated attack, Ponting said.         
	The most laughable aspect is when I hear former players complaining, as though they never put a toe out of line in their day. (PTI)

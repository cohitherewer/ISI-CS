                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Countdown to winter begins 
            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Its official now. The tentative date of the start for the citys winter racing season has been fixed for mid-December; said Cyrus Madan, chairman RCTC, at a media conference on Wednesday. Things are well under control because of the timely action, pertaining to incidences of fever and cough amongst Calcutta horses. The seasons start will, however, be subject to periodic review he added. The season was originally scheduled to start from Sunday.          
	The mediamen were also informed that more than 256 horses were down with fever, cough and running noses in the last 10 days. The ailment of few others may have, however, gone unnoticed.          
	Advices of the reputed veterinary practitioners like the Bangalore-based Dr Hasneyan Mirza and his Australian counterpart, Patricia Ellise, were also helpful. They are against pushing horses against time for their early recovery from the mystery fever, it was learnt. Madan, however, rued that fever has hit when RCTC was showing signs of prosperity.

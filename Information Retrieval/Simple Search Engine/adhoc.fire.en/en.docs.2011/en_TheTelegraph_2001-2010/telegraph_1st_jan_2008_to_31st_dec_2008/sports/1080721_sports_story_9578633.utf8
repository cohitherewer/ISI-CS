The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Sunday for Md. Sp.
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Super Sunday for Md. Sp.
  - CFL Premier Division East Bengal go down 1-3       A STAFF REPORTER            Theodore Sunday vies for the ball with Khelemba Singh at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: It was a Super Sunday for Mohammedan Sporting. Their 3-1 win over East Bengal helped them maintain their winning streak in the Premier Division of the Calcutta Football League.         
	Theodore Sunday scored a brace and Mike Okoro converted a spot kick for the black-and-white brigade. Khelemba Singh lent some respectability to the scoreline for a listless East Bengal.         
	East Bengals biggest loss against Mohammedan Sporting came in 1959 when they went down 1-5 in the Durand Cup semi-final. Had Mohammedan Sporting forwards not missed some routine chances on Sunday, they would have been able to improve on that margin.         
	The opening goal of the match came in the very first minute of the match when an unmarked Sunday headed in Mir Farooq Hyders corner from the left flank. The East Bengal defence, which missed the services of the injured M. Suresh, looked completely clueless on the occasion.         
	East Bengal never really recovered from the early jolt.         
	Both sides missed a couple of sitters after the goal, with East Bengal pressing hard for the equaliser. It finally came in the 75th minute when Khelemba shot home after the ball popped out of Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Imran Khans gloves.         
	The goal seemed to have served as a wake-up call for the black-and-white brigade.         
	The 15,000-strong turnout found a moment to relish in the 85th minute. Sundays second goal not only showed the East Bengal defence in poor light, it also eliminated whatever little chances they had of staging a comeback.         
	The Liberian forward dodged past three defenders with sheer pace and ball control and finished immaculately past an advancing Abhra Mondal.         
	Okoro scored the third for his team off the penalty spot when Anupam Sarkar brought down substitute Vimal Pariyar, a minute past the regulation time, inside the box. There were some controversy regarding Okoro taking the spot kick, as many felt that Sunday deserved a chance to complete his hattrick.         
	The controversies, however, can take no sheen away from Mohammedan Sportings victory against their arch-rivals. With three consecutive wins under their belt, the black-and-white brigade look set for bigger things in the league. The Sunday-Okoro combination might prove a handful for a lot of teams this season.         
	East Bengal, after already losing five points from only three matches, would desperately look forward to Edmilsons arrival and the return of their other players from national duties. Only time will prove if these will really prove fruitful in changing their fortunes.

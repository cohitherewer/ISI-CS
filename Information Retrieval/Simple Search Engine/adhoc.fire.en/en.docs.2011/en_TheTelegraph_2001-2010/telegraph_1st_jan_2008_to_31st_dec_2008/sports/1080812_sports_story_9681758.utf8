            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengals ordinary run in the Sahara CFL, Premier Division continued, after another below par performance on Monday against a resilient Calcutta Port Trust side at the Salt Lake Stadium. The match ended goalless.         
	Manoranjan Bhattacharjees boys went into the match knowing arch-rivals Mohun Bagan had picked up all three points at the same venue, barely an hour ago. Mohun Bagans match against Peerless had dug up the field considerably, but going by East Bengals mindless display, it wouldnt have mattered even if the pitch were perfect.         
	Playing under lights, the red and golds failed to brighten up the mood as the Port Trust midfield worked tirelessly to defuse their opponents moves.         
	With Mondays result Calcutta Port Trust have now taken points off the big three of Calcutta football in this years league. In another match played on Monday, George Telegraph beat United SC 3-2.

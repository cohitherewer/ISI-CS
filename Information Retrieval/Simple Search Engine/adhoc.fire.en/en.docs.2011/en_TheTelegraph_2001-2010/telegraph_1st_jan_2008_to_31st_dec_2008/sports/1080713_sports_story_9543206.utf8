	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will look to mix caution with aggression in their first match of the season on Sunday.         
	With two foreigners  Nigerian Mike Okoro and Liberian Theodor Sunday  in the striking force, coach Shabbir Ali hopes to make a winning start to the Sahara Calcutta Football League when they lock horns against the Railway FC at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	The Calcutta league is always difficult for us (Mohammedan Sporting). I have observed this during my playing days and I still feel the same. So this year we want to start cautiously, Ali said after the teams practice on Saturday morning.         
	They (Railway FC) are playing together for a long time and I dont want to take them easily. We would be watchful initially and then change our plan according to the situation, Ali said.         
	In Sundays match, Ali will miss the services of Roque Barreto and Vanlal Rova, both down with fever, and custodian Nasim Akthar, whose inter-state transfer certificate is still to arrive.         
	Asked how helpful the pre-season residential camp was, Ali said: It helped to gel the players together. But whether it has really helped us or not will be proved by our performance I want my boys to prove everything on the ground. I want them to fight and win They should never give up easily.

  -  Green and maroon brigade steps up pressure on leaders         A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagan players celebrate their first goal against United SC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan romped to their sixth win in a row in the I-League, beating lowly United SC on Saturday to step up the pressure on league leaders Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	The dream run for the local league champions continued as they beat their city rivals by a clear two-goal margin at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Mohun Bagans star strike-pair of Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto sealed the fate of the match in the first 30 minutes. The duo stitched together some brilliant moves from the onset, fed by S. Malsawmtluanga and Brazilian Marcos Pereira from the midfield.         
	Barreto, who was adjudged Man of the Match, opened the scoring in the 14th minute. Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa pays a lot of attention to set piece movements during practice. It probably bore fruit as the goal resulted from a short corner, taken from the right flank.         
	Malsawmtluanga floated in a cross after receiving Marcoss pass from the corner flag. Barretos header off the cross was not that powerful but it was enough to beat a diving Gopal Das.         
	Bhaichungs goal in the 30th minute resulted from a sublime move. Uniteds Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, who looked shaky from the start, lost out a battle for the ball to Malsawmtluanga.         
	The Bagan wingers quick pass reached Lalkamal Bhowmick, who sent in a first-time cross into the box. Barreto won an aerial battle to set up an unmarked Bhaichung. The 31-year old India captains scorching side-volley was too good for the United SC custodian.         
	Down by two goals in the opening half-hour, United coach Subrata Bhattacharjee made two changes to his starting line-up in the 33rd minute. But the move failed to change the teams fortunes.         
	The green-and-maroon brigade seemed a bit casual in the second half and failed to add to their tally. N. Mohan Raj, who came into the team for the injured Deepak Mondal, looked shaky. The one-time promising defender has looked short on confidence after having scored two own goals earlier in the season.         
	United SC, debutants in the I-League, managed to create a couple of opportunities in the last 10 minutes. Sankar Oraon was responsible for wasting both chances. On the first occasion he shot straight at the goalkeeper from six yards out and a couple of minutes later, his diving header was off target.         
	Teams         
	Mohun Bagan: Shilton Paul, Habibur Rehman Mondal, Peter Odafe, Ananda Vasan, N. Mohan Raj, Lalkamal Bhowmick (Ishfaq Ahmed 73), Rakesh Masih, Marcos Pereira, S. Malsawmtluanga, Bhaichung Bhutia (P.C. Lalawmpuiya 81), Jose Ramirez Barreto (S. James Singh 89).         
	United SC: Gopal Das, Kingshuk Debnath, Louis Nigi Ebami, Subhasish Roy Chowdhury (Dhanarajan R. 33), Sukhen Dey, Denson Devadas, Hardeep Singh (Basudeb Mondal 69), Snehasish Chakraborty, Lal Malsawma Hamar (Sankar Oraon 33), Gauranga Dutta, Subair Murithala Ali.

	MoM: Jose Ramirez Barreto

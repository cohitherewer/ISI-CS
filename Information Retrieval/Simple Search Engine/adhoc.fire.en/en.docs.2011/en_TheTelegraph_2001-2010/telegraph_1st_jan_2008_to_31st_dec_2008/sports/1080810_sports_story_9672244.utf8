The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delhi tipped to host final
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Delhi tipped to host final
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Hyderabad: Indias ambition to clinch a berth in the 2011 Asian Cup final rounds has been put on hold.         
	The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on Saturday decided to postpone the crucial AFC Challenge Cup final between India and Tajikistan on Sunday after incessant rain in the city left the pitch at the Gachibowli Stadium completely unplayable.         
	The losing semi-finalists match between Myanmar and North Korea, which was also scheduled for Sunday at the Lal Bahadur Stastri Stadium here, too has been postponed.         
	The matches are now likely to be played at Delhis Ambedkar Stadium on August 13, according to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources.         
	The final decision, however, will only be taken after AFC conducts an inspection of the Ambedkar Stadium on Sunday afternoon.         
	The Delhi stadium is currently being booked by the organizers of the Durand Cup football tournament.         
	The tournament committee, which had already fixed matches for Wednesday, has agreed to postpone their matches and hand over the ground to the AIFF for hosting the final.         
	The match, if shifted to Delhi, will be played under floodlights.         
	According to an AFC official, the Asian body holds the right of rescheduling the postponed match at any other venue. It could be held in a weeks time or may be a month, he said.         
	The AIFF, for obvious reasons, is keen to hold the final as soon as possible.         
	A delay of one month will not only upset the clubs, who are waiting for their players to come back, but may also force the federation to put off the start of the I-League next month.         
	The Indian coach Bob Houghton was happy with the decision. As all of us watched during the semi-finals, the ground condition was unplayable. It would be unfair to ask the teams to play such an important final on that pitch, he said.         
	The final match, the Indian coach said, should be decided by the quality of the game, not the condition.         
	On that surface, playing against the condition is more of a challenge than the opposition.The Indian coach and the footballers are obviously delighted by the prospect of playing at the Ambedkar Stadium in Delhi, where they won the Nehru Cup last September.         
	The Tajikistan coach Pulod Kodirov, who was fined $1000 by the AFC disciplinary committee on Saturday for his failure to attend the post-match press conference after the semi-final, said the AFC was right not to play the final at Gachibowli.         
	Things were quite bad in the semi-final also, he said.         
	Back in our country, we would have postponed the match.

                                                                                                                                                                                           Police probe suicide threat
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: With the Cricket Association of Bengal and the Eden Garden malis locked in a muddle, the police have now stepped in, launching an inquiry. It is unclear, however, as to who approached them.         
	According to an officer of the Maidan police station, the police would start their proceedings by talking to the malis employers.         
	Sources said that the CAB had intimated the police of the threat issued by the groundsmen in a letter addressed to the office-bearers last Monday.         
	CAB joint secretary Samar Paul, however, denied that the association had gone to the police.         
	We didnt go to the police. All newspapers, channels and agencies widely reported the suicide threat. The police themselves started an investigation, Paul told The Telegraph.         
	I have been saying repeatedly that we cant do anything The working committee has already rejected the malis plea. We can talk about increasing their payments and other facilities. But its impossible to make them permanent employees, he added.         
	In response to the development, the malis have sent another letter to the CAB president and joint-secretaries.         
	The malis have made it clear that they are very disappointed with the organisations decision to report the issue to the police.         
	Till now we have been keeping CABs prestige in mind, we never wanted to let them down. But this move has shocked us. Were almost starving         
	We havent accepted our salaries for the last five months. Our movement has always been a peaceful one Still they went ahead and involved the police, a senior groundsman said.         
	 We have to start thinking of other alternatives now. We have no faith left in CAB.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal grabs lead 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal grabs lead 
                      
	Knoxville (US): Arjun Atwals sore knee could not hold him back as the Orlando-based Indian fired a scintillating six-under 66 to grab the lead after the opening round of the Knoxville Open on the Nationwide Tour here.         
	Playing his back nine first, Atwal, who took a fortnight off before arriving here, had a flawless opening round, which got off to a birdie-birdie start. He rounded off with a birdie hattrick, picking up one more shot in between.         
	Atwals bogey-free round places him along side Jarrod Lyle and Chris Kirk who returned identical rounds.         
	Maybe its contagious in our work, Atwal later said of his knee injury, with an obvious reference to his friend Tiger Woods who is nursing a similar injury, which would necessitate surgery.         
	Atwal is 18th on the Nationwide Tours money order list and a decent show in this tournament would further brighten his chances of obtaining his PGA Tour card again.         
	On his form, Atwal said the 15-day break rejuvenated him. I sat on my couch, played with my kids and spent time with my family, he said. (PTI)

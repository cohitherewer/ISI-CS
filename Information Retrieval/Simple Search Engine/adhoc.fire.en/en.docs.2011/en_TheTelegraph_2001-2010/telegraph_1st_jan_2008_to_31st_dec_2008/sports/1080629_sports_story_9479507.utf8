	London: Sania Mirza and her American partner Bethanie Mattek sailed into the third round of Wimbledon womens doubles event after a comfortable straight-set win over Russian-Italian pair of Maria Kirilenko and Flavia Pennetta on Saturday.         
	Seeded 13th, Sania and Mattek handed a 6-3, 6-4 thrashing to their unseeded rivals in little over an hour.         
	In a lopsided encounter, Sania and Mattek dominated the proceedings from the word go as they broke their rivals once before wrapping up the first set in just 33 minutes.         
	The second set followed a similar script and Sania and Mattek could have sealed it off earlier than 44 minutes.         
	Meanwhile, in mixed doubles, Rohan Bopanna and his Belorussian partner Tatiana poutchek went down 3-6, 6-7 (1) to 13th seeded Swede-American pair of Simon Aspelin and Lisa Raymond in the second round on Saturday.

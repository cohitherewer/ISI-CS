                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wont quit ODIs
  - Sourav: No enmity with Dalmiya but...       A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly is not retiring from one-day Internationals despite being left out from the list of 30 probables for the Champions Trophy.         
	Speaking on the sidelines of a function at his residence on Thursday, Sourav denied having retirement plans, but said he was not sure which way his one-day career was going.         
	Ive been out of Indias one-day team for the last three months and am not going to play one-dayers for the next three. So Im not thinking about ODIs at the moment. Im concentrating on Tests and the upcoming Sri Lanka series, Sourav told reporters. Im still enjoying cricket and as long as I do that, Im not going to hang up my boots, he added.         
	Talking about India ODI skipper Mahendra Singh Dhonis decision to take a break from the Test series in Sri Lanka, Sourav said: Its his personal decision. Being the captain and a wicketkeeper-batsman, Dhoni takes a lot of pressure. So its natural to feel fatigued. But very few cricketers can afford to take a break.         
	I dont remember pulling out of a Test series because of fatigue when I was the captain, the former captain said.         
	It also depends on your position in the side; Im sure not many players, with a place in the side not guaranteed, will be able to do that. I know only one player who has been able to do it successfully  Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Asked whether the IPL was to be blamed for the fatigue, Sourav said: I dont think it opens up the IPL versus country debate.         
	Sourav said Ajantha Mendis would be the bowler to watch out for in the India-Sri Lanka series. He, however, hoped that the spinner would cease to be a mystery after a few years at the international level.         
	Batsmen will start picking him once they play him more often. But he is definitely a good bowler, Sourav said. Watching him on TV, I got the impression that he relies more on change of pace His leg spin doesnt turn much.         
	Sourav, who has been successful in both Tests and one-dayers, refused to buy the argument that the 50-over game would lose charm because of Twenty20.         
	I was in England recently. I went to watch a one-dayer between New Zealand and England. It was a full house, he said. So I dont think people dont like ODIs anymore. Im sure when the ODI format returns to India, well see the same packed house as it was earlier.         
	Expressing happiness at getting the Castrol Asian Cricket Awards (overall cricketer and overall batsman), Sourav said he enjoyed the year 2007 and scoring his first century at Eden Gardens, his home ground, was special.         
	Sourav also said that the behaviour of some members of the Jagmohan Dalmiya camp has hurt him, and if they dont stop saying derogatory things about his family, especially his elder brother Snehasish, he might consider not playing for Bengal any more.         
	I have no enmity with Dalmiya. But there are people who have been saying bad things about my family, especially my brother.         
	If this goes on, Ill have to consider not playing for Bengal, he said.         
	I dont have any problems with him (Dalmiya) coming to power. My only concern is the way a few CAB members are bad mouthing my family.         
	I cant tolerate this anymore. If they continue to do this, I wont represent Bengal. For the moment, however, Im available, Sourav added.

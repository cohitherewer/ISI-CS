            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Salt Lake Stadium remained dark for about 27 minutes on Saturday during the sixth round I-League match between United SC and Sporting Clube de Goa, due to a power disruption.         
	The snag first hit the floodlights (29th minute of the match) and then spread to the press box.         
	The stadium authorities blamed the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) for the mishap.

                                                Its going to be tough: RP
                      
	Rudra Pratap Singh, who led Team Indias opening attack in the absence of Zaheer Khan, had a session with the media on Wednesday evening.         
	The following are excerpts         
	Three wickets remain to be taken and while we have a great batting line-up, its going to be tough... Initially, I was nervous at the thought of leading the attack, but the nerves settled down quickly... I dont think we lacked energy after lunch, its just that the wicket slowed down... My aim was to strike the right areas... The ball was seaming and I didnt do anything different from what Id done in England last summer... (Andrew) Symonds and (Brad) Hogg hit hard and, yes, Hoggs batting came as a surprise... Id spent around 25 days at the Centre of Excellence in Brisbane, in 2005, and worked closely with Australias coach Tim Nielsen, who was then the head coach there... That exposure proved very beneficial...

                                                   Aiyar to meet Ric
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In a significant development, sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyar has called Ric Charlesworth for a meeting in the capital in the next couple of days, according to Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) sources.         
	The minister is believed to be upset by IHFs constant effort to keep Charlesworth away from the affairs of the national team, IHF sources claimed. He wants to meet the Australian coach and have a first hand information about what is going on in the national team.         
	Incidentally, technical advisor Charlesworth has not been invited by the IHF to attend the national camp going on in Bangalore. Instead he has been sent to Lucknow to attend the womens national camp for the Olympic qualifiers.         
	The government is paying a huge salary to Charlesworth, which is much more than what other foreign coaches are getting, the IHF official said. Yet, the IHF is not using him.         
	The IHF on Thursday also came under attack from the International Hockey Federation (FIH) for its inability to refrain national coach Joaquim Carvalho from criticising umpires after the Santiago meet.         
	The FIH is scrutinising what Carvalho had said Carvalho may land himself in trouble for not adhering to the FIH code of conduct, the IHF official said.

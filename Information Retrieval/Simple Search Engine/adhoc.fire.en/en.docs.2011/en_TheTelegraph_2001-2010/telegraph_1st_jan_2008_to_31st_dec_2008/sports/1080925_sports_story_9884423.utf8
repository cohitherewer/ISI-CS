The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka President for no strain in ties with India
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lanka President for no strain in ties with India
  - Clash between ipl 2009 and the England Tour         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            President Rajapaksa                                 
	Calcutta: President Mahinda Rajapaksa has, through sports minister Gamini Lokuge, conveyed to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) that it shouldnt do anything on the Indian Premier League (IPL) issue whereby sporting ties with India get strained.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources in Colombo, the countrys President took this rather unusual step after fears that SLCs tough stand on its players participation in the second edition of the IPL could result in an all-out war with the very influential Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	The BCCI is headed by politician Sharad Pawar, who will become the next president of the International Cricket Council.         
	A major problem has arisen because edition No.2 (from April 10-May 29, 2009) clashes with Sri Lankas tour of England, where two Tests and three ODIs are to be played. For his part, tough-talking SLC chairman Arjuna Ranatunga has made it clear that national duty comes first.         
	A World Cup-winning captain, Ranatunga is now a Member of Parliament and has been hand-picked by Rajapaksa to run the faction-ridden SLC.         
	Incidentally, SLC stands to earn $2 million from the tour, a sum which isnt insignificant for a body which, till recently, was in very poor shape financially.         
	A dozen Sri Lankans, including captain Mahela Jayawardene and vice-captain Kumar Sangakkara, featured in the inaugural edition. That number wouldve been 13 had quick Lasith Malinga, whod been bought by the Mumbai Indians, not been laid low by injury.         
	Hes still unfit.         
	The move towards a settlement with the players has gained momentum after the President stepped in... A couple of options are being explored, including one where the players could be compensated for the period they cant play in the IPL, one of the sources pointed out, on Wednesday.         
	The franchise owners, it may be noted, pay for the period players are available. Thats it.         
	One understands SLC is looking at possibly having to shell out a maximum of 15 days compensation. It wont, obviously, be that much for players whose teams dont make the semi-finals.         
	Negotiations are largely being conducted by (chief executive) Duleep Mendis, on behalf of SLC, and Graeme Labrooy, who is representing the players association... Jayawardene is also in the picture, as are a couple of other seniors, another source said.         
	Apparently, while a deadline hasnt been set, the players have nevertheless been told that the issue had to be settled at the earliest.         
	Meanwhile, its learnt that the players whore with the rebel Indian Cricket League, have only been allowed to play for their clubs in Sri Lanka. The ban on turning out for provinces stays.         
	The sports minister, it seems, has quietened down once SLC clarified its headline-grabbing decision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Benitez sympathy for Riise
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Benitez sympathy for Riise
                      
	Liverpool: Liverpool will have to score their first goal against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge since Rafa Benitez became manager in 2004 if they are to reach this years Champions League final in Moscow.         
	Liverpool have not scored in eight successive matches there and if they fail to improve on that record, Chelsea will meet either Manchester United or Barcelona in next months final.         
	The five-time European champions were seconds away from a 1-0 win over Chelsea in the first leg of their semi-final at Anfield on Tuesday after Dirk Kuyt had given them the lead in the 43rd minute.         
	Substitute John Arne Riise, however, headed into his own goal deep into stoppage time to give Chelsea a 1-1 draw.         
	The Londoners can now win the tie on the away goals rule if next weeks match ends goalless. Liverpool must score at least once if they are to avoid defeat at the semi-final stage of Europes elite competition for the first time since 1965.         
	They have not scored at Stamford Bridge since Benitez became manager, failing twice already this season losing 0-2 in a League Cup match and drawing 0-0 in the Premier League.         
	We know that winning at Stamford Bridge will be really difficult, said Benitez. It will be a tough game.         
	We have to go there and win. We havent scored there but that is just a statistic and maybe we can change that.         
	Stamford Bridge is a difficult stadium for everyone. No one has won there for two years. But it is Champions League so maybe we can manage. We know we have go to and win. It is not a case of thinking maybe we will be okay with a draw. That is a big difference.         
	Benitez was critical of Austrian referee Konrad Plautz for the amount of added time he played, but had sympathy for Norwegian defender Riise.         
	These situations are difficult. You cant blame the player. Those kind of balls when they bounce are difficult to deal with, he said.         
	We are all very disappointed to concede an own goal so late in the match. But we had three clear chances and in games like these it is hard to create chances. We created chances and we needed to take them.         
	Chelsea, who play Manchester United in what is effectively the Premier League title decider at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, have not lost a domestic match at home since February 2004.

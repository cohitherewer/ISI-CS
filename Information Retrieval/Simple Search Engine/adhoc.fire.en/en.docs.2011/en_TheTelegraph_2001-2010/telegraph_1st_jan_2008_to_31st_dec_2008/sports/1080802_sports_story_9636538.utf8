	Birmingham: England lost four wickets in the afternoon session to go into tea on 126 for four on Day III of the third Test at Edgbaston on Friday as South Africa scented a series victory.               
	England were 297 for six in their second innings at stumps on Day III, garnering a lead of 214 runs               
	Kevin Pietersen was 42 not out and Paul Collingwood was on nine as Englands lead stood at just 43 runs at the interval. South Africa had earlier been bowled out for 314 in reply to the home teams below-par first-innings total of 231.         
	Collingwood, without a Test century for 13 months and under pressure to keep his place, got off the mark with a boundary to give him 100 first-class runs for the season.         
	 Pietersen, meanwhile, was playing fluently on a pitch still good to bat on.           (REUTERS)

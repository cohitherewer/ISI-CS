	Madrid: Real Madrid fought their way back after a sending off and going a goal down to snatch a dramatic 2-1 victory at Osasuna and win their 31st Spanish league title on Sunday.         
	With Villarreal beating Getafe 2-0 in an earlier match, Real had to win the game to retain the championship but suffered a major setback when defender Fabio Cannavaro was dismissed at the start of the second half.         
	Real looked to be in even more trouble when Osasuna midfielder Patxi Punal struck home from the penalty spot after centre-back Gabriel Heinze had handled in the area with eight minutes to go.         
	But Dutch winger Arjen Robben equalised in the 87th, heading in after Gonzalo Higuain whipped a free kick into the area and the Argentine struck the winner when he lashed past Ricardo a minute from the final whistle.         
	With three matches left to play, Real have an unassailable 10-point lead over Villarreal at the top of the table. It is the first time they have won back-to-back league titles since they won five in a row between 1986 and 1990.         
	This team demonstrated that it has guts, determination... everything, Real president Ramon Calderon told a television channel.         
	This team can never be written off and they won the title in heroic fashion. Winning the title two years in a row is a huge achievement.         
	Real coach Bernd Schuster said he was delighted to have won his first major trophy as a coach.         
	It was like one of those American sports films when you have to fight and suffer but you eventually get a happy ending, said the German. We are going to enjoy the moment, celebrate with our fans back in Madrid and have a great time when we play Barcelona at the Bernabeu on Wednesday.         
	Villarreal made sure Real had to win the game by beating Getafe 2-0 at home, Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci scoring both goals with neat finishes either side of halftime.         
	The victory meant that Manuel Pellegrinis side retain their four-point advantage over Barcelona in the race for second place.         
	The Catalans hammered a beleaguered Valencia 6-0 at the Nou Camp, to record their first win in six games.         
	France striker Thierry Henry and youngster Bojan Krkic scored two goals apiece while Lionel Messi weighed in with a penalty and Xavi with a fine 20-metre drive.         
	Valencia, who have lost five of their last six league games, remain just two points above the relegation zone.         
	Real Murcia were relegated after they squandered a two-goal lead to lose 2-3 at high-flying Racing Santander and will now join Levante in the second division.         
	With Osasuna fighting for survival in the top flight, goal-scoring opportunities were at a premium in an intense and hard-fought contest at a rain-soaked Reyno de Navarra.         
	Osasuna fought tooth and nail in midfield and kept Real at bay for the remainder of the half and they received a major boost when Cannavaro was sent off after picking up a second booking for a foul on Czech midfielder Jaroslav Plasil.         
	Real looked as if they would have to put the champagne on ice when Punal fired home from the penalty spot, but showed the sort of determination and fighting spirit that has characterised their season to battle to victory.         
	Robben got in front of two defenders to nod in past Ricardo and the unmarked Higuain sparked wild celebrations among his teammates when he fired past the keeper after Sergio Ramos slid the ball to his feet on the right side of the area.

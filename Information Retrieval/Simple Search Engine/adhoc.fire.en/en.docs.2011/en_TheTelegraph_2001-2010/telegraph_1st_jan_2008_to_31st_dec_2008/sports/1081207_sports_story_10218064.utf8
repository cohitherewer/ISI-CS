The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gesture from PCB chief
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gesture from PCB chief
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ejaz Butt                           
	Calcutta: Its a time for gestures.         
	If Diego Maradona made one by not cancelling his frenzy-creating trip to Calcutta, despite widespread fear after the terror strikes in Mumbai, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt intends making one in a few days.         
	Specifically, Butt will be in Chennai for at least one of the first two days of the opening India versus England Test.         
	Butt is also the acting president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). Hell be confirmed in that position, succeeding compatriot Dr Nasim Ashraf, during the December 27 executive board meeting in Kuala Lumpur.         
	The ACC, it may be recalled, is headquartered in the Malaysian capital.         
	Post-Mumbai, Butt wishes to show solidarity... Both as head of the PCB and as the acting president of the ACC, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Butt will definitely be in Chennai on Friday, the second day of the Test. He could be there on Thursday itself, when Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Kevin Pietersen go for the toss.         
	While in Chennai, Butt will attend the finance committee meeting of the ACC as well. Thats on Friday.         
	Whats more, there will be an opportunity for Butt to interact with the Board of Control for Cricket in India chief, Shashank Manohar.         
	Butt was in Colombo for the development committee meeting of the ACC, held on Friday, but Manohar wasnt as he doesnt have a seat on that committee. There was, therefore, no possibility of the heads of the two Boards discussing (on neutral ground) the future of Indo-Pak ties.         
	Over the 22 yards, that is.

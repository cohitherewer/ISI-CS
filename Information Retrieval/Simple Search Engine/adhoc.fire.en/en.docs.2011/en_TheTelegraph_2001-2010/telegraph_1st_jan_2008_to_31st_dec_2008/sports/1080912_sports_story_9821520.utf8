The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Emile Heskey faces racial abuse
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Emile Heskey faces racial abuse
                      
	London: The Football Association said it would complain to world governing body Fifa after England players were racially abused by Croatia fans during their 4-1 victory in a World Cup qualifier in Zagreb on Wednesday.         
	We can confirm that we will be making a report to FIFA about the racist chanting aimed at Emile Heskey by some Croatia fans during the qualifier in Zagreb, an FA statement said on Thursday.         
	It is unacceptable for anyone to be subjected to racial abuse and we will be asking FIFA to investigate this. The FA and the England team are determined to do all they can to eradicate racism from football and society.         
	Striker Heskey was subjected to monkey chants during Englands impressive Group Six victory.         
	Youve got to let the people above deal with it, Heskey was quoted as saying in British newspapers. They are ignorant people, you have to ignore it and enjoy your football.         
	Croatian FA spokesman Davor Gavran said it was an isolated incident caused by a small group of fans.         
	The atmosphere at the stadium was fantastic, thanks to the supporters, and it would be unfair if one such incident marred the overall (positive) impression, Gavran was quoted as saying in a local newspaper.         
	Englands black players have endured racist abuse while playing in Europe before, with monkey chants being directed at players in a friendly in Spain four years ago. (REUTERS)

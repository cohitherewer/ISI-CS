                                                                                                                                                                                             Confusion over Dhoni
  - When we want rest we should get it, says Team India captain       A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Team India ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the Mumbai airport on Monday. (PTI)                                 
	Calcutta: There seems to be some confusion over Mahendra Singh Dhonis availability for the tour of Sri Lanka. At the post match press conference in Karachi on Sunday, the one-day captain was asked if he would skip the Lanka tour because of fatigue.         
	Dhoni evaded a direct reply and said things would be clear in the next couple of days. The selectors meet on Tuesday to pick the squad.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah said he had not received any intimation from Dhoni to exclude him from the squad. He was in the same flight with me from Karachi, but did not say anything at all If at all there is anything, we will know tomorrow, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said.         
	India are scheduled to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals during the tour of Sri Lanka to be held from July 18 to August 29.         
	Dhoni has been critical of the hectic Asia Cup schedule and found support in coach Gary Kirsten, who also felt that the one-day captain was feeling tired and needed a break. In India and the sub-continent we have a full year of cricket and theres no off-season. Its tough for cricketers. When we want rest we should get it, Dhoni said in Mumbai on Monday.         
	The BCCI has said we can take rest whenever we want which I think is a very good policy, he said adding, you will come to know that in a couple of days time.                     
	Looking ahead to the series against Sri Lanka in the Emerald Isle, Dhoni said he expected a tough battle between the two teams while adding that the return of experienced campaigners  Test captain Anil Kumble and off-spinner Harbhajan Singh  would prop up the attack.         
	Sri Lanka is a tough place to play but we will be prepared and we hope to do well. We will have Kumble and Harbhajan returning which will be a big boost, he said.         
	In Sri Lanka, sometimes spinners get some help and at other times theres no help for any type of bowler. If there are batting tracks then the batsmen are expected to take the responsibility. Otherwise we will be turning to Kumble and Harbhajan, he said.

	Calcutta: The Royal Calcutta Golf Club embraced its new star with style and a dash of tradition on Thursday evening. Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia, eyes glistening with tears and voice choked with emotion, said it was the best day of my life.         
	The Indian Masters champion was presented with an honorary membership, a silver salver and the Royal blazer.         
	The open dining hall was done up for the occasion and a special dais erected. Members made it a point to be present at the felicitation of one of their own.         
	From the octogenarian former captain T.D. Sinha to the newest caddie on the roster, all turned up to welcome the caddie-turned-pro. Chowrasias family was there in full strength too.         
	A great day. The best of my life. I will never forget this. When I won the title in Delhi I was dazed and didnt know what had hit me. Things happened so fast. Today I am more at ease with myself, Chowrasia said.         
	Royal captain Aveek Sarkar, who presented Chowrasia with the membership scroll and the blazer, said: Chowrasia didnt have to shout or raise petty issues. All he did was to recognise his talent and nurture it in the environment of the Royal. All of us will be better citizens of this city if we do the same.         
	Neil Law, who gave Chowrasia his first set of clubs, was also there. They met before the function at the Pro Shop, hugged and cried. Law gave him a crate of balls and the Royal cap.         
	Law, who has known him since he was a five-year-old, said the champion was like one of his children.         
	It was his talent that set him apart from the boys. He was very shy. His dedication has been exemplary, said Law.         
	Former captain Ashit Luthra congratulated Chowrasia for living up to the spirit of the Royal and hoped he would remember his promise to help out in the clubs junior programme.         
	While Luthra gave away the silver salver, Chowrasia received his membership card from Sinha.         
	The euphoria over his historic win, however, has not made Chowrasia lose sight of his target- to excel on the European Tour.         
	I will meet Jeev Milkha (Singh), (Arjun) Atwal and Jyoti (Randhawa) during the SAIL Open in Greater Noida next week. I will seek their advice, Chowrasia, who leaves the city on Sunday, said.         
	Royal chief executive officer M.M. Singh was the master of ceremonies.

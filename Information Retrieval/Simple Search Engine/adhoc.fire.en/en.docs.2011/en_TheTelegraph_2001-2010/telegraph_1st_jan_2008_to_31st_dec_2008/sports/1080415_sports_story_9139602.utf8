            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Subhas Bhowmick             Sukhwinder Singh      
	New Delhi: Two of Indias former national coaches  Subhas Bhowmick and Sukhwinder Singh  could be ineligible to coach any I-League club next season unless they get an AFC coaching licence immediately, according to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources.         
	The duo, considered to be senior pros in the Indian coaching arena, found themselves at the receiving end after members of the AFC Pro League committee  who were in the capital a few days ago to discuss the progress made by Indian clubs in implementing club licensing norms  pointed out that the Salgaocar and JCT coaches were yet to obtain the required degree.         
	The licensing norms were divided into many heads, which accounted for a total of 500 points, AIFF sources said. While Salgaocar and JCT fulfilled all the other norms, the AFC committee was not satisfied by the fact that their coaches did not possess an approved coaching degree.         
	Next year, the AFC is planning to increase the quota of Indian teams in continental club championships but that will only happen if all the Indian clubs in the First and Second Divisions of the I-League fulfil all the club licensing norms, the sources added.         
	Both Bhowmick and Sukhwinder have coached the national senior team in the past and have won innumerable titles in domestic football, including the prestigious National Football League (NFL).         
	While they said that their immense experience in coaching should be taken into account, the AIFF is certainly a bit embarrassed by the development.         
	Sources said that the federation might press national coach Bob Houghton into service to make Bhowmick and Sukhwinder eligible for club coaching through a fast-track course in the next few months.         
	I have no problem in going through the fast-track course if the rule is so, said Bhowmick. But frankly, it isnt necessary. I would like to know how many coaches in India can match me when it comes to winning trophies.         
	Sukhwinder, considered one of the countrys best tacticians, said: I have a degree from NIS and also a Fifa Coca-Cola coaching certificate. In my day, there were no AFC courses. They should have taken these things into account.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delivering for the team is more satisfying: Sachin
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Delivering for the team is more satisfying: Sachin
            OUR CORRESPONDENT             Sachin Tendulkar en route to his 40th century on Thursday. (AP)                           
	Nagpur: Sachin Tendulkar was a happy man after getting his first century in the current series against Australia. He had come close to it in Mohali before being dismissed for 88.         
	Excerpts from Sachins press conference after the first days play:               
	Are you happy with the teams score at close of play?         
	Right now I think there is a lot of cricket left in this match. I wont say we are in a brilliant position but definitely we are in a decent position. I think five wickets were too much today, three would have been okay.         
	How would you rate debutant off-spinner Jason Krejza?         
	He was a bit unlucky today with the way he was attacked by Sehwag in the beginning. However, I think he had a good first day (in Test cricket).         
	How crucial was your knock?         
	Today it was important that I got going because when I went in two wickets were down and later Sehwag also got out. It was important that Laxman and I put up a good partnership, and we were successful.         
	Happy about your 40th century?         
	I am delighted at getting the century. But as I said four more days to go, so the focus will be on that and not on what has been achieved. The focus is on the next innings.         
	Your opinion about the new stadium?         
	The facilities are good. We had heard a lot about the stadium before we came here but it has exceeded our expectations. The facilities in the dressing room, the viewing area and the gym are good. Even the spectators have a good view from all angles.         
	After scoring the century, you looked up and said something to somebody          
	It has to be only God (grins). I think after Adelaide, I have played around six or seven matches. I was batting well, but I was not getting to the three-figure landmark. That, of course, is not everything. This series, in all the four innings, I have gone in at crucial times and that, delivering for the team, is more satisfying.         
	There were some lapses in your concentration. Did that have anything to do with the emotions surrounding the senior players?         
	No, I dont think there was any loss of concentration. Talking about emotions, before the match all those thoughts come into your mind, but once you cross the ropes your thought process changes. Once we crossed the line, even Sourav was not thinking about them. He was focused today and so were we.         
	How would you rate Vijay?         
	He batted well, was calm and composed.         
	How about the track?         
	The wicket is good, it is a perfect batting track but with some help for the spinners. The spinners are getting bounce so I think in a day or two it will be difficult to play them.         
	You have got back your natural game         
	First, I was playing my natural game earlier also. Probably your opinion has changed, your viewing has changed. Natural game doesnt mean just going out and hitting bang, bang. Sometimes you got to play according to the merits of each surface.         
	12,000 runs, 40th century. What next?         
	I dont know; I am not playing for these targets. I am just playing for the team and while contributing towards the teams cause, if it happens it is a great satisfaction.         
	What was your gameplan when you went in today?         
	I think it was just about keeping the head cool initially because when I walked in, it was a critical stage. At that point we had to make sure that we had a good partnership and took the game away from Australia because the momentum was with them initially.         
	Did the batsmen have a specific plan to go after Krejza?         
	There were no specific plans. I saw the ball that is why I was trying a few shots.         
	Batting first, how much advantage does the team have over the Australians?         
	Batting first is definitely an advantage. But it is important to bat well when you get that chance and build up a big score. Then it is equally important to bowl them out early also. The momentum that builds up during the game happens when you bat first.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hosts restrict SA to 265 on tricky track
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hosts restrict SA to 265 on tricky track
            SUDIPTO CHOWDHURY                      
	Kanpur: It could boil down to the jadoo of the Green Park pitch. Be that as it may, India bounced back in the third and final Test of the ongoing Future Cup series, restricting the South Africans to 265 on Day I here.         
	The visitors were at times too defensive. They started promisingly but succumbed later, partly to their own mistakes and partly to a spirited Indian side sans their regular captain. Anil Kumble pulled out on being declared unfit after a test on Friday morning.         
	Harbhajan Singh and teenaged pace sensation Ishant Sharma claimed three wickets each while local lad Piyush Chawla bagged two. Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh shared a wicket apiece.         
	Ishant (3/55) made an immediate impact after his return from an injury break and Harbhajan (3/52) was at times unplayable.         
	However, it was a different scenario on Friday morning. The South African captain, Graeme Smith, won another crucial toss and rightly sent the Indians to field  the first step towards making it difficult for the hosts to draw level in the series.         
	India, however, suffered their first blow well before the toss when regular captain Kumble was declared unfit. He was replaced by teenaged leggie Piyush Chawla, for whom this was the second Test since his debut in 2006 against England in Mohali.         
	India made three changes in the final XI. While Chawla came in for Kumble, Irfan Pathan made way for Yuvraj Singh. Ishant Sharma returned after recovering from a foot and finger injury, replacing the struggling R.P. Singh.         
	Though Mahendra Singh Dhoni  who became the first wicketkeeper to lead India in a Test  did everything right to hinder the South Africans  a cautious and confident Smith, along with Neil McKenzie, had other ideas.         
	The Proteas started watchfully, overpowering the hosts on a pitch which started showing glimpses of turn and uneven bounce on Day I itself. However, as predicted, it was hardly demonic.         
	The Indian captain rightly gambled and introduced Harbhajan in the ninth over in place of Sreesanth from the pavilion end. While Sreesanth did a good job, Ishant was a bit rusty during his first spell of six overs, conceding 35 runs.         
	Everything was going right for the visitors, the run rate at one time reading five per over, Dhoni introduced leggie Chawla in the 18th over and he struck in the fifth ball.         
	McKenzie, who appeared to repeat his Chennai feat here again, was lured by a well-flighted delivery by Chawla just after hitting a boundary. He missed it and was stumped by the stand-in-captain Dhoni.         
	Chawla succeeded in extracting turn from the wicket and the uneven bounce caused the visitors downfall.         
	Smith, who was joined by Hashim Amla, reached his 21st half-century in Tests with a glorious six but was brilliantly caught by Wasim Jaffer in forward short leg off Yuvraj Singh at 69.         
	Yuvraj, who returned to the side after the infamous Sydney Test earlier this year, broke a 91-run partnership. Then Amla, who hit a 91-ball 50, failed to comprehend the pace and movement of Ishant and the ball, cutting in, dislodged the bails off the pad.         
	Sensing the chance, Dhoni, posted an attacking fielding and that paid off. The ball already 48 overs old started doing all the tricks. And with the hot April sun, the wicket dried up. The visitors appeared clueless and in the way, lost Jacques Kallis (1).         
	After tea, the Green Park witnessed a collapse. Chawla removed AB de Villers (25) with Virender Sehwag trapping Ashwell Prince and Morne Morkel edging Harbhajan to Rahul Dravid in the slip. Dale Styen was caught by Mohammed Kaif.         
	Ishant cleaned up Mark Boucher with a brilliant delivery that crashed onto the stumps after pitching outside off.         
	The Indians picked up the last nine wickets for 113 runs.

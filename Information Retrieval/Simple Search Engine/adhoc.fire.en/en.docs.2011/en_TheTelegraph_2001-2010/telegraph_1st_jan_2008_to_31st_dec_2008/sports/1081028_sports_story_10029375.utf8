The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand survived a tricky game
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anand survived a tricky game
                  GM SPEAK    Pravin Thipsay                  Viswanathan Anand                
	Defending champion Viswanathan Anand survived an extremely difficult  if not losing  position with a brilliant display of attack and tactics in the ninth game of the World Chess Championship match to force a draw in 45 moves after a long battle which lasted for five hours. With a tally of six points, the champion now needs only one draw from the last three games to reach the magic figure of 6.5 points.         
	The champion began the game with the Queens gambit which he has been playing all along in Bonn.         
	The challenger replied with the Queens Gambit orthodox set up, avoiding the exchange variation of the Slav defence, wherein white can force a draw effortlessly.         
	However, on move 4, the challenger converted the game into a Slav defence set-up. On move 6, Black opted for the sharp Botvinnik variation, invented by former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. In this system, Black wins a Queen-side pawn at the cost of seriously weakening the position.         
	Anand accepted the challenge and sacrificed the pawn on move 8, indicating that he was eager to finish off the match as soon as possible.         
	On the 11th move, instead of the usual castling on the King-side, Anand played his Queen rook to a central file, which is a theoretical novelty. This is the first time the players stopped blitzing the moves and started thinking for a while. Kramnik took about ten minutes to come up with an excellent defensive plan by pinning Anands knight and vacating an important square for own queen.         
	Scared of Anands exemplary attacking skills, Kramnik refrained from castling till Anand castled himself. On the 13th move Anand castled, Kramnik following suit by castling same side as Anand on the very next move. This resulted in a dynamically balanced position, Kramnik having an extra pawn in exchange for an exposed King-side and a badly placed bishop.         
	Generally, Kramnik would try to avoid double edged positions but the point position compelled him to go all out for a win. On move 15, Anand came up with a brilliant move, giving away a centrally placed Bishop for an important defensive Knight of Kramnik. The champion followed it up with a pawn roller in the centre, threatening to manoeuvre his knight to King-side with decisive threats. On the 17th move, Kramnik made a brilliant counter pawn sacrifice to activate his Queen Bishop.         
	For a change, Kramnik had good control of the important central squares. On move 20, Anand offered his centre pawn for initiative. However, instead of taking the pawn immediately, Kramnik brought his Queen rook into play and seized the initiative. At this stage Anands position looked quite gloomy.         
	Kramnik initiated direct tactical complication on move 21 and won a pawn but Anand had foreseen a brilliant defence which kept the defensive chances alive. With a combination of precise defence and counterattack, Anand forced a drawn ending by move 36. Kramnik sacrificed his Bishop on the 38th move to create a strong passed pawn but Anand gave back the Bishop on move 44, forcing an immediate draw.

	Mumbai: After having lost four successive matches, Kolkata Knight Riders have turned the tide. They have been hugely boosted by the presence of pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar.         
	While talking to reporters during the pre-match news conference on Thursday, captain Sourav Ganguly said he would be banking on the Pakistan speedster to polish off the Mumbai Indians top order.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On which four would qualify         
	As of now, no ones sure Deccan Chargers and Bangalore Royal Challengers are a bit behind. Any of the other six could qualify. Mumbai Indians have got four out of eight (wins) We have five victories in nine matches, Kings XI Punjab have won six Chennai Super Kings have registered six victories All teams are in with a shout. Of course the last five games would be crucial. In fact, you never know, if Deccan Chargers and Bangalore Royal Challengers win all their matches, they may qualify as well.         
	How is it to have someone like Shoaib on your side?         
	I have been at the receiving end all the time! So, its a welcome change. Also, Ishant can bowl quick, so can Ajit (Agarkar). We have a decent attack.         
	Expectations from Shoaib         
	Get Sachin out Get Jayasuriya out And get Uthappa out early. Finish it off Simple!         
	Low-scoring games on home turf         
	We see it differently. A few good batsmen have left us. We hope to have an attack to defend. We scored a lot of runs elsewhere and have defended well at Eden Gardens. So far its worked for us.         
	Including Aakash Chopra in the side         
	I know hes not the Jayasuriya type But hes been doing a job for us in the last three games that we won.         
	Mumbai Indians         
	They are a good side. In Twenty20 cricket anybody can win.         
	Shah Rukh Khans influence         
	Shah Rukh has been motivating us a lot. We win when hes around. We want him to be there whenever we play.         
	How important are openers?         
	Openers are important, but they are not everything

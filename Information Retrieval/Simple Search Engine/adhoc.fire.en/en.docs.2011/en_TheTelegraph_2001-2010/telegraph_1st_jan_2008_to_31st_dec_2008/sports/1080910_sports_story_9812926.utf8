The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand draws yet again
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anand draws yet again

	Bilbao: World Champion Viswanathan Anands hunt for an elusive victory continued as he played out a fifth draw at the Bilbao Grand Slam final, splitting point with Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine in the sixth round on Tuesday.         
	Anand, who has managed five draws and a loss so far here, had a diffcult time with black against Ivanchuk as the Ukrainian did not take many chances despite playing with white. Anand and Ivanchuk alongwith Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan continued to be tied fourth on 5 points each.         
	Levon Aronian of Armenia, with 6 points, remained sole third in the standings despite losing to leader Norwegian Magnus Carlsen, who took his points tally to 11 in the soccer-like scoring system that gives three points for a win and one for a draw.         
	Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, who was leading earlier in the tournament, slipped to the second spot following a hard fought draw with Radjabov. The fight for supremacy in the biggest prize money tournament turned in favour of Norwegian super talent Carlsen after he defeated Aronian in the second game too.         
	With Carlsen on top of the tables and Topalov breathing down his neck now, the gap between the rest widened and it will take a Herculean effort from other players to topple these two. Besides the five draws, the Indian ace suffered his lone loss at the hands of Topalov in round four.         
	It was a rather quick draw between Ivanchuk and Anand given the fact that draw offers are prohibited here. (PTI)

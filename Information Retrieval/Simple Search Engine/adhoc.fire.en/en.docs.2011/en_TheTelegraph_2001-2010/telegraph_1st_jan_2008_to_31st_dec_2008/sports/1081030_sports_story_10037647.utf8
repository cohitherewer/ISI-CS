	Defending champion Viswanathan Anand retained his world title after an easy draw in the 11th game of the World Chess Championship match in Bonn on Wednesday. With this brilliant performance, Anand becomes one of the few players to win the world title for the third time. Since World War II, only Russians Mikhail Botvinnik, Anatoly Karpov and Garri Kasparov have achieved this remarkable feat.         
	The 11th game began in quite an extraordinary way. It was obvious from the start that Vladimir Kramnik was desperate and would try to win at all costs. Throughout his career so far, Kramnik has played the solid Russian Defence and Spanish Opening with black pieces against the King Pawn Opening. Though he has lost hardly any games with these openings, he has also not been able to win many. Therefore, when Anand decided to open the game with the King Pawn on Wednesday  for the first time in this match  he clearly started with a great advantage.         
	In a bid to create complications, the challenger surprised the chess world by opting for the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence for the first time in his life.         
	Further, when Anand countered it with a sharp attacking line, Kramnik chose the double-edged Kasparov Variation popularised by the former world champion in the late 80s.         
	A sharp tactical struggle began as early as on the 12th move when Anand sacrificed a pawn to obtain an important outpost in the centre. Kramniks premature decision to accept a Trojan gift on move 12 soon drove him into an unenviable position. In fact, such an anti-positional capture is generally made only by club-level players. Perhaps it was an attempt to tempt the champion into doing something rash.         
	Anand played aggressively initially and got a dangerous initiative in the early middlegame. On the 15th move Kramnik had to move his king rook and on the 18th he lost his right to castle as he was forced to move his king.         
	With a powerful safeguarding king move, Anand left Kramniks forces scattered and en-prise (undefended) all over the board.         
	At this stage, however, the champion decided to play it extremely safe as he needed just a draw in two games to retain his title. The champion forced the exchange of queens on the 22nd move by giving a checkmate threat. Anand did not try to press his advantage and accepted the draw offer made by the challenger on the 24th move.         
	The match, expected to be a close one, was actually completely dominated by Anand from the very beginning. After drawing the first two games, Anand changed his strategy and started playing sharp tactical and double-edged positions unsuitable to style of the challenger.         
	At this stage the challenger made a huge psychological blunder. Instead of choosing what suited him, Kramnik played into Anands hands by allowing the champion to get positions of his choice. When the first half of the match was over, Kramnik had only 1.5 points against Anands 4.5.         
	In the second half, Kramnik changed his strategy and played solid chess. He also changed his openings suitable to his style and actually fought back reasonably to score 2.5 points from the next four games.         
	On Wednesday, however, he was lucky to get away with a draw, since that is what his formidable opponent was aiming for.         
	India has reigned supreme in the game over the last couple of years. Earlier this year, the world junior boys and girls titles were won by Abhijeet Gupta and Dronavali Harika. Anands victory is the final endorsement of Indias supremacy.

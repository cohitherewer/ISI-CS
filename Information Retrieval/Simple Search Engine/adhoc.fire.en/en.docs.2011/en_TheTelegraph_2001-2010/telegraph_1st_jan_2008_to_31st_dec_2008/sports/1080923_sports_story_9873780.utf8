	New Delhi: The true picture in the Monika Devi doping saga may finally see the light of the day with the sports ministry on Monday deciding to get the lifters sample B tested abroad.         
	In a letter to the scientific director of the national dope testing laboratory (NDTL) the ministry referred to the T.S. Krishna Murthy report on the saga and sought testing of Monikas B sample in the World Anti-Doping Agency-accredited laboratory in Tokyo.         
	As recommended by T.S. Krishna Murthy, it has been decided that the B-sample kept with NDTL in respect of Monika Devi should be examined by an accredited laboratory outside India for immediate analysis, the ministry said.         
	The ministry also asked the official to find out if Monika would like to be present herself at the time of testing or would send a representative.         
	In accordance with the rights available to the athlete under Wada code, the athlete must be given the opportunity to be present herself or send her representative.

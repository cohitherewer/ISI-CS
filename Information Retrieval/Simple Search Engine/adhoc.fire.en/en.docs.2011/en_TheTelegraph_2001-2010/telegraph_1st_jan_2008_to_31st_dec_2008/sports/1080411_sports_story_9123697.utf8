The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev wants to see a major change
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev wants to see a major change
                      
	Augusta: The US Masters and British Open have opened their doors to Asian Tour players and Jeev Milkha Singh now wants organisers of the two other majors  the US Open and PGA Championship  to follow suit.         
	Jeev, Thailands Prayad Marksaeng and Chinas Liang Wen-Chong have been invited to tee up in the first major of the year despite slipping out of top 50.         
	The British Open too offers an exemption to the Asian Tour Order of Merit champion and Jeev believes that the other majors too should invite Asians. Every tournament has their own rules and its up to them to make a decision. But I would love to see that happen for the Asian Tour players because its a global sport now. If that happens, itll be great for Asia, said Jeev, who finished tied 37th at last years Masters.         
	He pointed out that it had been difficult for Marksaeng to finish in 72nd place on the official world golf ranking last season despite his achievements on the Asian and Japan Tours, which receive fewer world ranking points compared to Europe and the US.         
	I believe thats why Prayad was given the invite to the Masters as they recognised that he played well last season and its great to see, the Indian said. Jeev, meanwhile, has set his sights on achieving a childhood fantasy by becoming the first Asian to clinch a major title, at the US Masters. Growing up I always dreamed of winning a major championship and my favourite major is the Masters, Jeev said while completing his tournament preparations on Wednesday.         
	If I could do that, it would be a very, very special moment for me. It would be a dream come true. Although bitterly disappointed at shooting a seven-over-par 79 in the final round on Augustas heavily contoured layout, he believes he learned valuable lessons.

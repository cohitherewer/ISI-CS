            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT                        
	Calcutta: Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) will be holding its next race meeting on Sunday, instead of Saturday. The change follows Hydrabad Race Clubs (HRCs) decision to prepone its back-to-back fixtures  beginning from Sunday  to Friday and Saturday.           
	The re-scheduling of fixtures was necessitated after HRCs decision to suspend its live operation for two weeks to vaccinate all horses in the Malekpet racecourse. RCTC will conduct Inter-venue betting on all the three days.

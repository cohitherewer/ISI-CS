The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kevin Davies keeps Bolton hopes alive 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kevin Davies keeps Bolton hopes alive 
                      
	London: Fulham and Bolton Wanderers earned Premier League lifelines on Saturday with victories over Reading and West Ham United respectively to keep their survival hopes alive with four games remaining.         
	Goals by Brian McBride and Erik Nevland secured Fulhams 2-0 win, their first away success in the league in 19 months, while Bolton ended a dire run with a 1-0 home victory over West Ham courtesy of a Kevin Davies goal.         
	With Birmingham City drawing 1-1 at home to Everton, the days results have tightened up the battle at the bottom, which was beginning to look cut and dried.         
	Derby County, already relegated and thumped 0-6 at home by Aston Villa on Saturday, are bottom on 11 points. Fulham have 27, Bolton 29, Birmingham 31, Reading 32 and Wigan Athletic 34.         
	Fulham had not won away from Craven Cottage since beating Newcastle in September 2006 but even when American striker Brian McBride put them ahead after 24 minutes their fans would not have been getting too excited. On 12 previous occasions this season they had taken the lead in league games but only twice did they go on to win.         
	In other games, Manchester City won 2-1 at Sunderland, who are still not certain of safety on 36 points, while Tottenham Hotspur drew 1-1 at home with Middlesbrough. (Reuters)

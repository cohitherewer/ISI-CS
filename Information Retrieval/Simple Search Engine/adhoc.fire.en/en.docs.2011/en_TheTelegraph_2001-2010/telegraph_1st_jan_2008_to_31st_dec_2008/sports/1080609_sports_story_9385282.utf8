The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal cruise to 4-1 victory
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bengal cruise to 4-1 victory
            JAYDEEP BASU            Nabi                           
	Srinagar: It took Bengal 135 minutes to score their first goal in the 62nd edition of the Santosh Trophy, after their goalless draw against Goa in the last match. But when they finally struck, it looked as if the floodgates had opened.         
	On Sunday, in front of near-empty stands at the Bakshi Stadium, the 29-time champions were on the rampage against Karnataka. In the end, Bengal won 4-1 but they could have easily doubled the smargin.         
	In the other match of the day, Goa defeated Maharashtra 2-0 with John Dias and Denzil Franco scoring the goals in the last 10 minutes. The Group B is now interestingly poised with both Bengal and Goa having four points from two matches.         
	Chasing the two heavyweights for a place in the semi-finals are Karnataka, who have three points. Bengal, however, have the best goal difference among the three teams.         
	Never for a moment in the first session had Bengal looked capable of winning by a huge margin. They were an unsure lot in the middle, who had everything but the ability to find their ways through the rival defence.         
	The deadlock was finally broken at the stroke of the half time by substitute Asim Das, who was pushed in by Bengal coach Krishnendu Roy only a minute ago. Like Vaclav Sverkos did it for Czech Republic on Saturday night, Das also donned the role of a super sub and scored seconds after he took the pitch.         
	Bengal skipper Jayanta Sen was in roaring form and was providing his strikers with defence splitting passes. He took a measured freekick from around 10 yards away from the Karnataka box and the ball dipped into the area. Das rushed in and jumped neatly to head home.         
	I had full faith in my boys. I knew they would tear open the rival defence once we score the first goal, said Roy.         
	Bengals next three goals came in a span of 17 minutes. While Gauranga Dutta made it 2-0 in the 68th minute, Syed Rahim Nabi, who looked most impressive among Bengals forwards, scored the next in the 78th minute. Substitute Tarif Ahmed volleyed in spectacularly in the 84th minute to add to the tally.         
	Xavier Vijay Kumar, the lone man to impress in the Karnataka ranks, pulled one back in the 78th minute.

	Calcutta: East Bengal kicked off their second I-League campaign in style, hammering United SC 3-1 at the Barasat stadium on Friday.         
	Playing the first competitive match under new coach Stanley Rozario, the red-and-gold brigade looked a different side from the one that played the recently concluded Sahara Calcutta Football League. Starting with six national team players and three accomplished foreigners, East Bengal showed slick movement and energy both on and off the ball.         
	The forwards  Edmilson Marquez and Sunil Chhetri  interchanged positions and were ably supported by Yusif Yakubu, playing from a withdrawn position.         
	Yakubus shot in the opening minute was cleared off the line by United SCs Dhanarajan, but Subrata Bhattacharjees men could not prevent Surkumar from scoring in the 10th minute. The marauding right backs shot from the right edge of the penalty box found its way past goalkeeper Arindam Ghoshs near post.         
	The Manipuri right back was a real live wire, galloping down the flanks and affecting quick exchanges with Edmilson and Sunil Chhetri.         
	Yakubu, making his debut, got his teams second for the evening, finishing off a smart move which he started himself. In the 19th minute, the Nigerian released Rennedy Singh down the left touch line and raced into the box in time to head home the cross.         
	Sunil Chhetri, who didnt look particularly lethal in the CFL, got off the mark, taking advantage of a hapless United SC defence. Edmilsons ball from the centre circle saw a weak attempted clearance from Arnab Mondals head. Sunil, lurking in the defenders shadow, latched on to the loose ball and placed it calmly over Arindams outstretched hand.         
	United SC never looked like getting back into the game and Rozarios side was cruising, keeping possession at will. Apart from one early effort, East Bengal custodian Subrata Paul was untested in the first 45 minutes.         
	The second half saw a reversal of sorts with United SC going on the offensive and East Bengal content on holding their defensive shape. Subratas boys dominated possession and troubled the East Bengal defence at every opportunity.         
	The young side, to their credit, got a goal back in the 34th minute of the second half through Sankar Oraons left-footed effort from a throw in. Oraons runs down the gaps left by the East Bengal back four was impressive.         
	Thanks to the two-goal cushion, East Bengal had no further problems in finishing the match. The good start that Rozario had hoped for was executed professionally by playing a thorough team game.

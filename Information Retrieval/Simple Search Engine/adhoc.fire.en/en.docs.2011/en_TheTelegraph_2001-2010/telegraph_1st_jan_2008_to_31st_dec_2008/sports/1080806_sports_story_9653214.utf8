The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shane Warne worried for Pietersen
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shane Warne worried for Pietersen

	Melbourne: Kevin Pietersens meteoric rise to England captaincy comes as no surprise to his close friend Shane Warne but the Australian spin legend fears that the quick elevation might make it difficult for the flamboyant batsman to keep his feet grounded.         
	My biggest worry (with Pietersen) is that he gets a bit far above himself and doesnt keep his feet on the ground.         
	Hes got to remember who his friends are. If he keeps that in mind, he will be all right. He has as much talent as anyone that has ever played the game, Warne said.         
	Pietersen was handed Englands test and one-day captaincy after Michael Vaughan made a tearful exit following the teams recent debacle against South Africa.         
	Warne said England would miss Vaughans leadership, that won them the 2005 Ashes, when the two teams square up for next years Ashes.         
	Vaughan is crucial for England to regain the Ashes next year because he is such a good captain, Warne said.           (PTI)

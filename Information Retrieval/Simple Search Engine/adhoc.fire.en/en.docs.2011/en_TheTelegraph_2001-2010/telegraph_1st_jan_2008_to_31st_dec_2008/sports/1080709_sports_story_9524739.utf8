            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Come Friday, the thoroughbreds hoofbeats will reverbrate the RCTC s track after a break of nearly three months. Its going to be the monsoon season with a difference; said Boman Parakh, secretary RCTC. Although, there has been a minor hiccup like shifting the opening days programme, on Thursday, by a day because of adminstraive reasons, we will see some exciting sport in the coming weeks, added Parakh.          
	Parakh has reason to be happy, considering that the stake money offered  Rs 4.3 crore  during the season is almost double compared to was given out in the last monsoon season. The available horse-strength of about 335 in the Hasting stables may also ensure healthy fields. RCTC is not unduly worried about the poor fields in the opening day card. Things will fall into place in a week or two; said Parakh. There are only six events in Fridays card, featuring the Cherry Handicap in which trainer Arti Doctors Apostrophe may start as a favourite.

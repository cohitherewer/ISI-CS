The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies were desperate: Opener
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aussies were desperate: Opener
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Gautam Gambhir on Wednesday rated his career-best unbeaten 149 at the Kotla higher than the century he scored in Mohali.         
	In Mohali, the century came when we were already ahead by around 200 runs, Gambhir said. But here, I had to give a good start to the team. That, too, after we lost two quick wickets. I had to get those runs on the board for the bowlers.         
	The following are excerpts         
	On the impact of his two back to back centuries         
	There was a lot of talk around me, wherever I used to bat, that I have been getting out in the 60s and 70s. The important thing was I always knew that the big score was just round the corner. If I get just one hundred, that could be the turning point of my Test career. That Mohali hundred had worked in my favour. Maybe now I am much more relaxed. Playing on my home ground, I didnt feel any pressure and that helped me to get those runs.         
	How does he feel about scoring two consecutive tons against Australia?         
	I made my debut against Australia and I was all at sea, to be honest. At that time, I had one dream  to score runs against Australia. That dream is now coming true. I was very determined coming into this series, because I remember my debut Test. It wasnt that great an experience.         
	Plans for the second day         
	I want to concentrate and score more runs. It is still a good track. But as the match progresses, the pitch will crumble and there will be inconsistent bounce. So our target now will be to put up a huge score for the bowlers so that they can take 20 wickets.         
	On problems with Shane Watson and Simon Katich         
	They did everything to breach my concentration. The way we batted, they had no other way. They were desperate to get me out. So, under such circumstances, it was very important for me to maintain my concentration.         
	What happened between him and Watson         
	I dont think I need to get into this argument about Shane Watson. There was no chance he could have got me out.         
	On elbowing Watson         
	It wasnt deliberate, it just happened accidentally. There wasnt a need for me to stick my elbow out, it just happened.         
	If he is going to lodge a complaint with the match referee         
	No, we havent lodged a complaint with the match referee. It has been a hard fought series so far and such things do happen.

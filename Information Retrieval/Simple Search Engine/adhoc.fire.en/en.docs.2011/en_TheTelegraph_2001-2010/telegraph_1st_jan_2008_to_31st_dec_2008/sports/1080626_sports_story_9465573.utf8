The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar stars in Lanka win
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kumar stars in Lanka win
                      
	Lahore: Powered by Kumar Sangakkaras brilliant hundred, Sri Lanka notched up a comprehensive 131-run win against Bangladesh in a group A match of the Asia Cup at the Gaddafi Stadium here on Wednesday.         
	Sri Lanka never looked back after amassing 357 for nine that also included 74 from Chamara Kapugedera and restricted Bangladesh to 226 for seven. Sangakkara smashed 101 off 91 balls and effected three dismissals behind the stumps to earn the Man-of-the-Match award.         
	Bangladesh never gathered steam in the run-chase.         
	To cop matters, Mohammed Ashraful fell for eight to a bad decision by Simon Taufel, who ruled him caught behind on the leg side when television replays showed the ball from Dilhara Fernando had brushed his thigh. Ashrafuls dismissal after opener Nazimuddin was out for one, put Bangladesh out of contention.         
	Opener Tamim Iqbal played a steady knock of 28 from 40 balls but he was lucky to get those runs as the Lankans floored three catches he offered.         
	Earlier, Sangakkara, who opened with Sanath Jayasuriya took advantage of the conditions as both rattled the Bangladesh bowlers with an opening stand of 116 in 14 overs.

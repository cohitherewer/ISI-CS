  - ICC appoints Lloyd as Cricket Committee chairman
            A STAFF REPORTER              Caption                              
	Calcutta: The ICC failed to reach a decision on taking any action against the troubled Zimbabwe board at its annual conference in Dubai on Thursday and the deadlock forced the governing body to meet again on Friday to find a way out.         
	According to a media release, the executive board appointed former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd as chairman of the Cricket Committee and changed the result of the controversial 2006 Oval Test between England and Pakistan to a draw. The following are the details of what went on in the meeting:         
	 On Zimbabwe         
	The ICC Board had a lengthy discussion on Zimbabwe and it was decided to adjourn and reassemble on Friday (July 4).         
	 On Future Tours Programme (post-2012)         
	i) All three formats should be protected and promoted with Test cricket identified as the pinnacle of the sport         
	ii) The icon Test series must be protected         
	iii) ICC should look at ways of taking greater central ownership of international cricket outside its events or at least providing for more consistency in marketing/promotion         
	iv) The concept of a Test Championship and/or play-off should be explored further         
	 Amendment to disciplinary process         
	Both the CEC and the Board agreed to the recommendation that a match referee will be entitled to report a Level 3 and Level 4 breach of the Code of Conduct. The breaches will then be referred to an independent adjudicator from the existing list of ICC Appeals Commissioners.         
	 On Marlon Samuels         
	An official enquiry  made up of Michael Beloff QC, chairman of the Code of Conduct Commission and two other commissioners  found both the process and the punishment (two-year ban) to be appropriate.         
	 On the Oval Test         
	The Board decided that the result of the match between England and Pakistan be altered from an England win to a draw.         
	 On 2008 Champions Trophy         
	The Board received an interim, oral report from security consultants on the arrangements for the Asia Cup. A final report will be provided in due course following the conclusion of the ongoing tournament. At this stage the Champions Trophy will proceed as scheduled.         
	 Playing conditions for the 2008 Champions Trophy and 2009 ICC World Twenty20         
	The playing conditions include a provision for a one-over eliminator to replace a bowl-out in the event of a tie. The eliminator will be applicable in the semi-finals and the final of the Champions Trophy and all matches in the ICC World Twenty20.         
	The loss of two wickets by the batting side ends the innings. If the scores are equal then the team hitting the most sixes combined from two innings in the main match and the one-over eliminator would be the winner. If the scores are still equal at that point then the result would be decided on who scored the most boundaries  fours and sixes  in both innings.         
	 International playing conditions         
	The CEC decided on a series of amendments to the playing conditions all of which will come into effect from the Champions Trophy except the one on power plays, which will be implemented on October 1, and the one on intervals, which will be implemented immediately.         
	 On comfort breaks         
	Substitute fielders shall only be permitted in cases of injury, illness or other wholly acceptable reasons. Wholly acceptable reasons should be limited to extreme circumstances and should not include what is commonly referred to as a comfort break.         
	 On clean catches         
	Should both umpires be unable to arrive at a decision, they may consult the third umpire for any definitive evidence on whether the catch was taken cleanly or not. Following it, a final decision will be taken by the umpire at the bowlers end. Should he be unable to decide, a not-out decision shall be given.         
	 On changing of balls (ODIs)         
	It was agreed to continue with the playing condition.         
	 On intervals (ODIs)         
	It was agreed that the playing conditions be amended to reduce the interval by amount of actual playing time lost up to a maximum of 15 minutes rather than the current requirement of reducing the interval to 30 minutes only after more than 60 minutes have been lost.         
	The following amendment was also agreed upon:         
	Where the innings of the side batting first is delayed or interrupted, the umpires will reduce the length of the interval.         
	 On power play         
	The batting side would be permitted to choose when one of either the second or third power plays takes place. It was also agreed that three fielders would be permitted outside the field restriction areas during both the second and third power plays.         
	 Cricket Committee chairman         
	The Board selected former West Indies captain and ex-match referee Clive Lloyd as the new chairman of the Cricket Committee.         
	 Chairman of Code of Conduct Commission         
	Michael Beloff QC was retained as chairman of the Code of Conduct Commission.

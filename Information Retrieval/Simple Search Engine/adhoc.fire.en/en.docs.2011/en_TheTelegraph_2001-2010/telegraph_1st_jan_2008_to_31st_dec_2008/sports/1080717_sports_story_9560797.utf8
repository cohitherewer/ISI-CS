                  Harbhajan Singh                     
	New Delhi: After three months in the wilderness following the slap-gate episode, controversial Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh is back to what he does best and eager to prove his match-winning mettle.         
	The last three months have been tough. There have been lot of downs, I wont say ups. But Im happy its over Now Im looking forward to the Sri Lanka series, the spinner told a television channel.         
	Harbhajan slapped India teammate Sreesanth during an Indian Premier League (IPL) match resulting in him being banned from the remainder of the Twenty20 extravaganza, besides incurring a five-one-day International ban from the Board of Control for Cricket in India.         
	I faced a lot but that is behind me and there is no point going back to what happened. Bad times are over and I just want to focus on my game and keep on playing the kind of cricket that I have been playing for the last 10 years.         
	I want to bowl well and bat well and win matches for my country and thats what is important to me, he said.         
	Harbhajan lamented on missing the tri-series in Bangladesh and the Asia Cup in Pakistan but said he was now looking forward to the Sri Lanka series.         
	Every cricketer wants to play each and every game and I wanted to be there in Bangladesh and Pakistan and I also wanted to represent the Mumbai Indians and play all the games. But things obviously didnt go well for me.         
	But I have learnt a lot from whatever happened and looking forward to starting well, Harbhajan said.           (PTI)

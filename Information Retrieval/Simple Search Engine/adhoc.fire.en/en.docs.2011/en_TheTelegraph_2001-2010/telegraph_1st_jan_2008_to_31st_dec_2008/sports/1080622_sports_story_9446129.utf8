                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rahil: Never expected to clinch title
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Rahil Gangjee sounded quite philosophical after winning his first PGTI title at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club course on Saturday. The Calcutta-based golfer said lifes biggest surprises happen when you least expect it.         
	I never expected to win the title here. When you dont expect it, it happens for you, Gangjee said.         
	The player, who would next play in an Asian Tour event in Thailand, said most of his celebration on Saturday would be with his family.         
	Right now, I will be spending some quality time with my family at home. One of my old friends is also coming over, and maybe we would spend some time out in the evening, said Gangjee, who had his whole family by his side to cheer for him in the final round.         
	Giving a lot of credit to Anwar Wahhab, his physical trainer, the winner said being physically fit has helped him a lot in the tournament.         
	You guys walked with me these two days... So you know that it was physically very difficult in this humidity. I have been spending a lot of time in the gym and working really hard on my fitness. My fitness helped me immensely, Gangjee said.         
	The player, who has now moved to eighth on the 2007-08 PGTI Order of Merit, also attributed his victory to home advantage.

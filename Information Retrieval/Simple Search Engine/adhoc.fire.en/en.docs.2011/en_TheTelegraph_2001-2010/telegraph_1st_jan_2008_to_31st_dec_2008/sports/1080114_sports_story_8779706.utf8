                                                   Federer feeling 100%

           
	Melbourne: Roger Federer has shaken off a stomach virus and is 100 per cent fit for the defence of his title at next weeks Australian Open, the Swiss said on Sunday. 
    
	The world No. 1, who will be bidding for his 13th Grand Slam title, one behind the record held by Pete Sampras, will go into the event having not played a competitive match for two months. 
    
	Andre Agassi, in 1995, was the last man to win the event without playing competitively in the build-up, but any thoughts that he will be under-prepared were dismissed out of hand as a calm and confident Federer said he was raring to go. 
    
	Yeah, I would consider myself 100 per cent, Federer told reporters on Sunday. 
    
	Ive been playing sets the last couple days, which was very important for me. Im happy with my form, to be honest. Very pleased. Physically Im fine now, too. No more issues. 
    
	A stomach virus caused Federer to change his pre-tournament plans, skipping the exhibition event in Kooyong in favour of rest and gentle practice at Melbourne Park. 
    
	For many, the prospect of going into a Grand Slam event without any competitive tennis for a couple of months would fill them with dread. 
    
	Not Federer. 
    
	Im very much used to it, not playing for four weeks or six weeks and then coming in and playing a big tournament, so for me its not much of a change, he said. 
    
	I practised very well in Dubai before coming here, so I definitely created a good base for this fortnight. Thats what I feel now when I get back on the practice courts. Tennis comes back very quickly. 
    
	Federer said the new Plexicushion courts at Melbourne Park seemed to suit his game, but criticised the tournament for the change. 
    
	I think the surface is a little bit too slow, in my opinion, he said. Everything is already slowing down. Everybodys already complaining that were playing too much from the baseline. 
    
	I think its not good to change surfaces at the Grand Slams because what if the French (Open) would all of a sudden go to hard courts? 
    
	(Then) its not the same tournament any more. Theyve changed the surface too many times in the last years here. So they had better keep this one for the next 50 years. 
    
	Federer, who begins his campaign against Argentine Diego Hartfield, has played in 10 consecutive Grand Slam finals and said he felt comfortable under the intense pressure placed on him at the start of each one. 
    
	Theres always a lot of pressure, but somehow I always get through, he said. I have got the right approach and Im confident. Ive got different styles of play I can use to win matches.

	Dubai: Sania Mirza and partner Francesca Schiavone reached the quarter finals of the $1,500,000 Barclays Dubai Open after winning their first round encounter in straight sets. 
    
	The Indo-Italian combine beat wild cards Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia and Amelie Mauresmo of France 6-4, 6-4 at the WTA Tier II hard court event on Monday night. 
    
	They next play the winners of the match between top seeds Cara Black of Zimbabwe and Liezel Huber of the US and Chinese duo of Shuai Peng and Tiantian Sun. 
    
	Maria Sharapova, meanwhile, has pulled out of the tournament citing a viral illness. The Australian Open champion, who also won in Doha last week, is unbeaten in 2008 and had been scheduled to play her first match in Dubai on Centre Court in Tuesdays evening session. 
    
	Unfortunately I have been battling a virus for several days and its reached a point where Im unable to compete, the world No. 5 said in a statement on Tuesday. 
    
	This is really disappointing to me, but I do intend to come back to Dubai next year and hopefully have a great tournament. (AGENCIES)

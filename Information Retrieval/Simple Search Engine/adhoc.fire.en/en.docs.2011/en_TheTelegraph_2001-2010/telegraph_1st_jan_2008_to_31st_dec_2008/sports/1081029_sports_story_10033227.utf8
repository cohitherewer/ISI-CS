The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hull face Chelsea on level terms
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hull face Chelsea on level terms
            PREMIER LEAGUE                
	London: Chelsea visit Hull City on Wednesday hoping to avoid becoming the latest big scalp from the capital for the Premier Leagues surprise package.         
	Hull, who this time last year were struggling in the second division and were thrashed at home by Chelsea in the League Cup, have beaten Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Fulham so far in their debut season in the top flight.         
	There has been a joke doing the rounds that Chelsea might even pull off a surprise win at Hull but nobody from Stamford Bridge will be taking the trip to Humberside lightly.         
	Hulls incredible start continued with a 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday which put them level on 20 points with Chelsea who lost 0-1 to Liverpool, their first league home defeat since February 2004.         
	They travel to champions Manchester United at the weekend.         
	Chelsea should have midfielder Joe Cole back from injury.         
	Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said his sides win at Chelsea had sent out a message to the rest of the Premier League and he will want that underlined in thick red marker when they take on Portsmouth at Anfield.         
	There appears to be genuine belief that this Liverpool side  who hold a three-point lead after their win over Chelsea  can compete all the way for a first title since 1990 but they know any slips will be punished.         
	Pompey, meanwhile, wasted no time in promoting former England captain Tony Adams from assistant manager to the top job on Tuesday and a visit to Anfield is one of the toughest debuts imaginable.         
	Fourth-placed Arsenal host Tottenham Hotspur in a north London derby that Spurs fans may well be viewing with a little more optimism than they were three days ago.         
	Harry Redknapp won his first game in charge of Spurs  a 2-0 victory over Bolton on Sunday  and now goes to neighbour Arsenal hoping to win there for the first time in the league since May 1993. Spurs are still bottom of the league.         
	Fifth-place Aston Villa hope to stay in touch with the pacesetters by beating Blackburn at home and Manchester United, stuck in sixth after being held 1-1 by Everton, need to beat West Ham at home.         
	Wednesdays other games are Bolton vs Everton, Fulham vs Wigan, Middlesbrough vs Manchester City, Stoke vs Sunderland.           (AGENCIES)

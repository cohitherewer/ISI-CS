The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gilchrist ready to sledge Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gilchrist ready to sledge Ponting
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian Premier League has seen long time friends and teammates turn foes. Sunday will see Australians Ricky Ponting and David Hussey pitted against Adam Gilchrist and Andrew Symonds.         
	Deccan Chargers Gilchrist said he is ready to sledge Ponting and Hussey during the tie against Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens on Sunday.         
	Whether I sledge Ponting or not depends on the runs he scores... But I cant say I wont sledge, Gilchrist said.         
	But they are also my Australian teammates... So, the exchange of words will be in a funny way and the spirit of cricket will not be compromised with, Gilchrist added.         
	The retired wicket-keeper batsman also said he had sent a text message to Brendon McCullum after the New Zealanders unbeaten 158 off 73 balls at the Chinnaswamy in Bangalore on Friday.         
	I sent him a text message immediately after the match. Terrific knock, but please dont play such an innings against us I wrote, Gilchrist said.         
	Was he planning to play such a cracker of an innings on Sunday? You cant plan such knocks. In Twenty20, time is short. So there is not much time to plan for such an assault. Whatever happens, happens on the field.         
	Gilchrist said he was happy with the reception in India after the acrimonious tour Down Under. When we reached Hyderabad, the reception was warm, he said.         
	However, he wasnt sure how Eden Gardens would welcome Symonds.         
	I cant say about that till he sets foot here. The Eden crowd is known for its sporting spirit, he said.         
	On Sourav Ganguly-led Kolkata Knight Riders, he said: They are a good opposition. Im looking forward to playing a good and exciting match.

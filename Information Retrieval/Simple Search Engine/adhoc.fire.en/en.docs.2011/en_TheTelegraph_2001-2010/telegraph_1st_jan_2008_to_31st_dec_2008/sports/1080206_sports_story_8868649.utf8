The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mascarenhas shines in England win
                                                Mascarenhas shines in England win
                      
	Wellington: England continued their perfect start to their tour of New Zealand by beating the Black Caps by 32 runs in their first Twenty20 international at Eden Park in Auckland Tuesday.         
	England, who opened their two-month tour with back-to-back wins over Canterbury last weekend, compiled an impressive total of 184 for eight from their 20 overs.         
	New Zealand could only manage 152 in reply despite a gallant 61 from their big allrounder Jacob Oram.         
	Kevin Pietersen top-scored for England with 43 off 23 balls while Dimitri Mascarenhas thumped four successive sixes off spinner Jeetan Patel in a brisk 31.         
	Captain Paul Collingwood (26), opener Phil Mustard (20) and Owais Shah (23) also chipped in with valuable runs for the tourists. Chris Martin and fellow seamer Kyle Mills captured two wickets each for New Zealand.         
	Oram dominated the New Zealanders innings, striking seven boundaries and two sixes in his spectacular 40-ball knock.         
	Only two other players made double figures and Ryan Sidebottom led the way for England, collecting three wickets.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC questions Mushtaq, Waqar appointments
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ICC questions Mushtaq, Waqar appointments
    - Gambling links put Pakistan duos england jobs on the line           Scyld Berry            Waqar Younis                                 
	Serious doubt surrounds Englands appointment of Mushtaq Ahmed as their new spin-bowling coach because of his former links with illegal gamblers. The International Cricket Council (ICC) revealed on Saturday that they would write to the England and Wales Cricket Board as a matter of urgency this week to question the appointment of the 38-year-old former Pakistan and Sussex leg-spinner.         
	The ICC letter, to be written by chief executive Haroon Lorgat in consultation with their Anti-Corruption and Security Unit, will demand to know if the ECB were aware of Mushtaqs tainted background and took it into account when they made the appointment, which was announced last Thursday.         
	The same question will be asked of the ECB over their simultaneous appointment of Waqar Younis, the former Pakistan pace man, as a bowling coach to work with Englands high performance squad in India next month.         
	Both Mushtaq and Waqar were censured and fined by the Qayyum Commission in Pakistan, who published their report into match-fixing in 2000. Justice Qayyum said of Mushtaq at the time: He has brought the name of the Pakistan team into disrepute with, inter alia, associating with gamblers.         
	Mushtaq received the heavier censure and fine, Rs 300,000 rupees (2,370) to Waqars Rs 100,000 (790). The commission recommended that Mushtaq should also be kept under close watch and be not given any office of responsibility (selection or captaincy) in the team or on the board, while Waqar should be kept under observation and investigated.         
	Since the reports by Justice Qayyum and Indias Central Bureau of Investigation into match-fixing, the ICC have believed there is an onus on member countries not to employ any players implicated in those reports. According to an ICC spokesman on Saturday: There is no official, written ban because it might not stand up in a court of law, but there is a moral responsibility on member countries not to employ anyone who has been implicated in such wrongdoing in any position with any international team at any level.         
	When the Pakistan Cricket Board employed Mushtaq Ahmed as Pakistans assistant coach two years ago, the ICC chief executive at the time, Malcolm Speed, wrote to the PCB to remind them of their responsibilities. Mushtaq was removed from his post hours before the teams departure for the ICC Champions Trophy in India.         
	He was, however, reappointed for the 2007 World Cup on the recommendation of Pakistan captain, Imzamam-ul Haq, who himself had been fined by the Qayyum Commission. Mushtaq stood down immediately after the tournament.         
	However reformed a character Mushtaq may be, however brilliant his leg-spin bowling for Sussex has been, and however valuable his advice to the England spinner Monty Panesar might be when he goes to India next month, his past could always catch up with him.         
	As an ICC source said: The underworld guys never leave you if you have some weak point they can exploit.         
	An ECB spokesman said: If the ICC do write to us, we will consider their letter when it arrives.           THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

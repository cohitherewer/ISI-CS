The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies are just too defensive: Laxman
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Aussies are just too defensive: Laxman
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            A frustrated Ricky Ponting at the Kotla on Thursday                           
	New Delhi: V.V.S. Laxman, who struck a majestic unbeaten double century on Thursday, called the Australians a hugely defensive side. According to him, the visiting team is led by a captain, who spends more time on commenting on the opposition than his own side.         
	This (Australia) is a good team but inexperienced. Most of them are playing in India for the first time. What I feel is that they are just too defensive. There is something wrong in their mental approach. I think Ricky (Ponting) is talking more about the Indian team than his own side, Laxman said at the end of the second days play at the Kotla.                 
	The following are excerpts                 
	Prior to the series, there was so much talk about your retirement. What do you feel now after scoring a double hundred?         
	The Doubting Thomases were in the media, not in the dressing room. There was no such talk in the team. The team management and the selectors always gave me the confidence. Unfortunately, all the reports that appeared before the series were negative but we took it in a positive manner. It united us. Because of the negativity in the media, we could do so well in the series so far.         
	It means you blame the media?         
	It is the media, which keeps on advising the players on retirement. The players are well aware of their responsibilities. They are mature enough to know when to take the decision.         
	So, you think the media should behave in a more responsible manner!         
	Well, they should know what to do. What hurt most is people talking on our behalf. Each of us has been around long enough to know our roles. We are not asking anyone to over-respect us but one should not degrade us.         
	You have six centuries against the Australians so far. What do you think of the present team?         
	Well, the Australian team that we played last time was almost the same. Only Adam Gilchrist is not there. They beat us 2-1 then. This is a good team but inexperienced. Most of them are playing in India for the first time. What I feel is that they are just too defensive. There is something wrong in their mental approach. I think Ricky (Ponting) is talking more about the Indian team than his own side.         
	How do you feel now about getting sacked as the Deccan Chargers captain?         
	I wanted to focus on this series after I was sacked as the captain of Deccan Chargers. Its not as if I wanted to prove something, in fact I had my eyes trained on doing well in this series.         
	Why did you make a gesture like a left arm bowler after completing your century?         
	(Laughs) That was meant for Zaheer Khan. But I wont say why. It is a secret.         
	After scoring the first hundred, how did you prepare yourself for the second one today?         
	It was unfortunate that I was not able to contribute in the first and the second Tests. I was keen to contribute here. It was very important for us to get a big first innings score here so that we could put the pressure on the Australians. Also, it was very important for me to carry on and get a big score and not throw my wicket away after scoring a hundred.         
	How satisfying is it?         
	Very much. After a long time I got a big score of more than 150. I was scoring hundreds but was not getting a big century. It is a good sign for me. I hope this is a start of process. I will keep getting big hundreds.         
	What were your feelings when you approached the double century mark?         
	I was just looking to play to the merit of the ball, trying to play percentage shots. We got 600 plus runs in a little over five sessions of play. I wanted to achieve that target.         
	What are your plans for the third day?         
	Well, we will definitely try to get the Australians out as quickly as possible. I think the wicket will take spin and we have good spin bowlers. Also our pace bowlers are bowling very well. The Australians will be under pressure.         
	How do you feel about playing the 100th Test match in Nagpur?         
	Naturally, it is going to be a special moment for me. Forget about 100 Tests, representing India is always an honour.         
	You will turn 34 on November 1. How will you celebrate?         
	By scoring plenty of runs between 34 and 35.

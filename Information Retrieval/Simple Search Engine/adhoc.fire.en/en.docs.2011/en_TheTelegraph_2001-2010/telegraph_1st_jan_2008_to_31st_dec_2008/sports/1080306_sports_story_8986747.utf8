                                                     Need to take gradual steps, says Sachin
                  Sachin Tendulkar                     
	Brisbane: Sachin Tendulkar has hailed the fantastic job done by Indias young players in the tri-series against Australia but also underlined the contributions of players who have been around for seven-eight years.         
	The master batsman, whose 117 not out and 91 in the two finals against Australia were the key to Indias victories, also cautioned against getting too euphoric about the triumph, saying the team has to take gradual steps towards becoming the worlds best side.         
	Its important we take gradual steps. So far the youngsters have done a fantastic job, he said after the thrilling nine-run win over Australia that gave India their maiden tri-series win Down Under.         
	This young team has done very well but if you look at cricketers who have been around for seven-eight years, they have contributed in a big manner as well, he added.         
	Tendulkar also downplayed his contribution to the teams win and said the triumph was a collective effort.         
	I dont want to speak about my performance but my feeling is everyone has done an excellent job, he said.         
	Everyone in the team, including the coaching and support staff, need to be complimented for having done an excellent job, he said.         
	Robin Uthappa was over the moon and claimed that the coming few years are going to be the best for Indian cricket.         
	I was watching the game at home and heard Ricky Ponting say that they would wallop India by 4-0 and that Australia would have a cakewalk in one-dayers. Well, they didnt, he quipped.         
	It got me going. Its been a good young side which has shown a lot of energy in the field, he added.         
	Uthappa himself played a part in Indias solid foundation in both the finals where he put on 50 and 94 runs for the first wicket with the irrepressible Tendulkar.           (PTI)

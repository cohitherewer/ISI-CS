                                                   Chowrasia tied 8th in Malaysia
                      
	Kuala Lumpur: S.S.P. Chowrasia had just one bogey in an otherwise blemish-free card of six-under 66 which earned him a share of the eighth spot  the best among the Indians  after Day I of the co-sanctioned $2 million Maybank Malaysian Open on Thursday.         
	Chowrasia set the Kota Permai Golf and Country Club on fire with birdies on the 11th, 12th, 15th and the 18th, the bogey coming on the 13th. Starting on the 10th tee, he made the turn at three-under.         
	The Indian Masters champion then struck birdies on the second, fourth and the seventh holes in a flawless front-nine.         
	The Calcutta pro trails leader Nick Dougherty by four strokes. The Englishman has a two-stroke lead after firing a sizzling 10-under 62. His round included 10 birdies.         
	Also teeing off from the 10th, Dougherty stunned one and all by sinking seven consecutive birdies. He also had three on the 11th, 12th and the 13th.         
	Englishman Simon Dyson and Australian Marcus Fraser were in tied second place, two strokes behind Dougherty.         
	Indias Gaurav Ghei and Jyoti Randhawa both turned in cards of five-under 67 for a share of the 17th spot. They are one stroke behind Chowrasia.         
	Rahil Gangjee, Jeev Milkha Singh and 2003 Malaysian Open winner Arjun Atwal each carded a two-under 70 and were all at tied 53rd. Shiv Kapurs two-over 74 placed him at tied 131st.

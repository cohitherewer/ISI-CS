                                                     Abject surrender by batsmen
    - TRI-SERIES 
  -  Pathan (4/41), Ishant (2/32) efforts go in vain                   Irfan Pathan, who scalped four for 41, is ecstatic after dismissing Matthew Hayden in Adelaide on Sunday                           
	Adelaide: Indian bowlers pinned down Australia but the batsmen made a mess of a modest chase and crashed to a 50-run defeat in a tri-series one-dayer here on Sunday.         
	After the seamers had restricted Australia to 203 for nine, Indias much-vaunted batting order collapsed in just 41.2 overs for 153 against an Australian attack sans spearhead Brett Lee.         
	Australia also managed a bonus point and are virtually assured of a place in the final.         
	The hosts lead the table with 17 points from five matches. India stay second with eight points from as many games, while Sri Lanka have six from four outings.         
	India, chasing 204 for win, were up against it when they lost three wickets in a clutch to be 59 for four by the 16th over. Irfan Pathan (14), Gautam Gambhir (34) and Rohit Sharma (1) departed within eight balls.         
	Sachin Tendulkar went early for five off a dubious leg before decision but Gambhir and Pathan took the score to 55 without much trouble.         
	India were revived by the 56-run fourth-wicket stand between skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (37) and vice-captain Yuvraj Singh (26) and appeared to be back once again in the hunt.         
	Yuvraj struck a big six off Brad Hogg and three fours before hitting a long hop from the left-arm spinner into the hands of Stuart Clark.         
	It was a critical blow for the visitors as Dhoni was hamstrung by a pulled thigh muscle and needed a runner to support him. The end became a reality when Dhoni was run-out for 37, made off 50 balls with one four, as his runner Rohit Sharma failed to make it at the non-strikers end.         
	All the frontline bowlers did a good job for the hosts with Mitchell Johnson (three for 42) and James Hopes (two for 16) being the stand-out performers.         
	Earlier, Michael Clarke played a lone hand in providing Australia with a fighting total. The middle-order batsman held his ground while the rest departed. He compiled 79.

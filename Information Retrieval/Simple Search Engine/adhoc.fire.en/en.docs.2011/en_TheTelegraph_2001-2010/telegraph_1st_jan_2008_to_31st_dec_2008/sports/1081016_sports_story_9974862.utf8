The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anil will bounce back: Kirsten
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Anil will bounce back: Kirsten
                      
	Mohali: Unfazed by Anil Kumbles lack of form and fitness, India coach Gary Kirsten believes the veteran leg-spinner would overcome his shoulder injury and bounce back with a match-winning performance in the second Test against Australia.         
	Kumble had a pretty ordinary outing in the Bangalore Test where he not only went wicketless but also injured his shoulder which cast a cloud of doubt over his fitness ahead of the second Test starting here on Friday.         
	Kirsten, however, is certain that Kumble would not only play the Test but also come up with a match-winning performance to prove his mettle.         
	We are watching him and at the moment he looks alright. Theres a little pain but we hope him to be ready in two days, Kirsten said after Indias practice at PCA Stadium here.         
	He is a warrior and is very keen to play. Im almost sure that regardless of what he is physically, he would be ready to represent the country, a confident Kirsten added.         
	Kirsten didnt read too much into Kumbles lacklustre show in Bangalore and said one odd setback did not diminish Kumbles greatness as a bowler.         
	We dont look at one Test, but over a long period of time. Kumble is one of the greatest Indian cricketers ever. A great player struggles (momentarily) before coming back stronger. Kumble has been doing the same for 17 years and I believe he would come up with a match-winning performance here, he said.         
	Overall, Kirsten was happy with the way India snatched a draw in the first Test and the cohesion in the side also warmed his heart.         
	Im very happy with the way we played the first Test. Everyone spent some time in the middle. Most of them contributed, though those were not big scores, still they were some sort of contribution and that too in pressure situations.         
	Even from my playing days, I have never seen such unity and togetherness in an Indian team. They are eager to win the Test series against Australia.         
	Pacer Zaheer Khan came in for special praise from Kirsten.         
	I think what makes him such a force is that he has tremendous belief in himself, which helps any player. He is very intelligent too, knows what needs to be done and when.           (PTI)

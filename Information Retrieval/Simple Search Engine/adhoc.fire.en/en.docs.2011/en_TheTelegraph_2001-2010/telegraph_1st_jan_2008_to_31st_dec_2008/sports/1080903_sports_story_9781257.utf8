                                                                                                                                                                                           Advani survives scare
                      
	Bangalore: New Zealands Gary Oliver gave a scare to fancied Pankaj Advani before going down fighting in a league encounter of the ONGC IBSF World Billiards Championship.         
	The 23-year-old local boy prevailed over his dogged opponent 3-2, but not before some tense moments in an edge-of-the-seat match at the Karnataka State Billiards Association hall.         
	But other Indians including Geet Sethi, Sourav Kothari, defending champion Rupesh Shah and Devendra Joshi had no such difficulty and scored emphatic victories. (PTI)

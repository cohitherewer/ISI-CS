	Melbourne: Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik has stepped in to prevent Australia from cancelling their March tour of the troubled nation, saying he would personally speak to Ricky Pontings men and convince them about the security situation in his country. 
    
	I would like to speak to them personally and tell them that we will have good security for them in Pakistan. India have come here and there was a lot of talk then, but in the end there was no problem. It will be the same for Australia, Malik told an Australian daily. 
    
	Malik said cricket fans in Pakistan were keen to see the Australians in action and urged Pontings men not to disappoint them. 
    
	They are the best team in the world at the moment, and there are many fans in Pakistan who would love to see them. Hayden, Ponting, Symonds are all very good players, and we have also got a good side to play them. It would be bad for the game and for the people in Pakistan if they did not come, he said. 
    
	Maliks views were echoed by former Pakistan captain Imran Khan who said there was no danger for touring cricketers. 
    
	I dont think the cricketers have any threat at all, he told a Melbourne radio station.

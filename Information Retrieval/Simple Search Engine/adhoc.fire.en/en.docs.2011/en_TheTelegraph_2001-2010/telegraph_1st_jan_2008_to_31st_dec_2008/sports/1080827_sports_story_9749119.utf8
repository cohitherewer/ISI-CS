	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will decide on a coach for the senior side later this week. Joint secretary Arun Mitra said on Tuesday that CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya will meet senior Bengal players over the next two days for their suggestions.         
	Palash Nandy, Utpal Chatterjee, Devang Gandhi and Goutam Som (Jr) are some of the names that are in the reckoning, but the final decision will be taken solely by the president, Mitra said.         
	The final announcement will be made before consultant Mohinder Amarnath lands in the city on September 3 to meet the players.         
	The CAB office-bearers will meet representatives of the various first division clubs on Wednesday to discuss the cricket calendar and various other issues for the upcoming season.         
	Meanwhile, Manoj Tiwary called on joint secretary Biswarup Dey and requested him to inquire into the reasons behind his exclusion from the India A side for the series against Australia A.

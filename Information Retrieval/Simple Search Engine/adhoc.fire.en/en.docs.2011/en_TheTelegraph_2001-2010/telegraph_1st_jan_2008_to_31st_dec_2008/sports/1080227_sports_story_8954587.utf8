                                                    Too many brains at work: Sachin

	Hobart: Sachin Tendulkar hasnt been in the best of touch in the ongoing tri-series but the maestro said on Tuesday that he was unconcerned about the overreaction from too many brains about his form. 
    
	Tendulkar, who has scored 191 runs from eight innings so far, said he was hitting the ball well and his confidence hasnt dipped. 
    
	I scored in the 30s twice against Sri Lanka and a 40-odd against Australia. I failed only in the last three innings. It is a case of too may brains working (over my form), he said after hitting a 54-ball 63 in Indias seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in Hobart. 
    
	I am all right and hitting the ball well. I am confident and the team is confident. People tend to get carried away because of more expectations. They should not react more than is necessary, he said. 
    
	India will now face Australia in the best-of-three finals starting in Sydney on March 2 and Tendulkar emphasised on the need for the top order to fire if they have to turn the tables on the world champions. 
    
	The top order has been Indias Achilles Heel, largely annulling the fine show by the young bowlers so far in the series. We have to ensure that we do not lose early wickets against Australia. Only then we have a chance to beat them. 
    
	We have to plan our strategies carefully. Brett Lee has been bowling well I think we have to work out how to tackle him. 
    
	Tendulkar said the team is confident of doing well in the finals. We were 51 for four (in the last match versus Australia) and the boys came back fantastically to come closer to the target and score nearly 300. 
    
	He was all praise of the young bowlers who have been on the spot. 
    
	They have done a good job. Today (Tuesday) too, we thought the pitch would do something early on but it turned out to be an easy wicket. The young pacers bowled at the right areas and bundled them out for a paltry score.

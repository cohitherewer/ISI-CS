    - Branco Cardozos equaliser gets hosts a point             A STAFF REPORTER            Air India custodian Arup Debnath denies Mohun Bagan duo Jose Ramirez Barreto and PC Lalawmpuiya at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan was held by Air India to a 1-1 draw in their I-League encounter at the Salt Lake stadium. Bimal Ghoshs boys will leave the city with two hard-earned away points.         
	Missing the likes of experienced pros like Bhaichung Bhutia, Sangram Mukherjee and Habibur Rahaman Mondal, Karim Bencharifa had no option but to field a side low on experience. Mohan Raj, Rahul Kumar and Lalramluaha though having turned out for the green-and-maroon brigade in the local league, often found the going difficult against an organised Air India side.         
	Nervous miss passes and mistakes were seen from time to time. Playing in the centre of midfield, Lalkamal Bhowmick looked his usual creative self after many a match.         
	Arup Debnath playing in goal for Air India was the standout performer of the day, saving at least four clear cut chances. Arup kept out Lalkamals stinging grounder in the 12th minute, throwing himself with great agility to his right. Lalkamal and left winger Ishfaq Ahmed turned provider for the front two of Jose Ramirez Barreto and P.C. Lalawmpuiya on many occasions in the first period, but the efforts on goal went wide from the two strikers. Barretos effort in the 29th minute was a treat to watch as the evergreen Brazilian curled one from distance with his right instep. Arup though was invincible in goal at this point.         
	As the half grew to a close, Air Indias Kailash Patil had a great opportunity to steal one for his side, against the run of play, but Patil squandered the chance firing wide. Ghoshs side though somehow went into the break with a one goal lead. A 45th minute free kick from Napoleon Singhs right foot took a deflection off the Bagan wall, landing perfectly for an opportunistic Soccor Velho within the six-yard box. Soccor made no mistake in converting it.         
	The lemon break saw Lalkamal being replaced by Shylo Malswamtluanga. Bencharifa also threw in Branco Cardozo soon after, making it three upfront. Bagan finally managed to get their much-desired equaliser in the 70th minute. Barretos clever back-header released Lalawmpuiya into acres of space. The forwards cross was met by an unmarked Branco inside the box, who turned it in past Arup in goal.         
	Air Indias Soccor and Micheal Tayo came close towards the end with efforts that either went wide of the mark or were kept out well by Shilton Paul, the Bagan custodian.         
	Bagan therefore have managed just a single point from two home matches. They are next slated to take on Sporting Clube in Goa, while Air India will play East Bengal in Mumbai.

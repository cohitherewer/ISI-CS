                                                                                                                                                                                                     Symonds needs to look at himself, says Steve
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Iconic former Australia captain, Steve Waugh, has torn into Andrew Symonds for his behaviour in Darwin. According to Sundays edition of the Daily Telegraph in Melbourne, Steve was quoted as saying: Theyve done the right thing by sending him home.         
	Theres got to be consistency in the group and youve got to stand for something. You cant have players doing that sort of stuff.         
	Hes got to have a good look at what hes doing for sure. Hes got to re-assess where hes at if hes doing these things. Its not the first time.         
	Sport, across the board, guys are getting paid a lot more money, youre definitely more accountable for your actions, Steve said.         
	Meanwhile, Sydney Morning Herald quoted stand-in captain Michael Clarke as saying: Its so hard to play for this team.         
	In my opinion, we are the greatest sporting team in the world, and we have standards. They may be higher than other teams, but if you dont fulfil those standards, unfortunately, youre not going to be a part of our squad.         
	The main concern for us is Andrews commitment to playing for this team. In my opinion and the rest of the leadership groups opinion, you need to be committed 100 per cent to all facets of being an international cricketer.

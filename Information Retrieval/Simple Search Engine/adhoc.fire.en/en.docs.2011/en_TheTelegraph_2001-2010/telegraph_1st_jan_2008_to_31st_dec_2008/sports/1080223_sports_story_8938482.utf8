The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Langer prefers county to IPL
                                                   Langer prefers county to IPL
                      
	Melbourne: Former Australian opener Justin Langer has preferred English county cricket to the IPL. Langer said he would honour his commitment to Somerset, instead of playing for the Jaipur team in the IPL starting on April 18.         
	I have made a commitment to Somerset and I intend to honour it, Langer was quoted as saying by a newspaper. I made that clear when I first signed with IPL and I have no hesitation sticking to it.         
	Meanwhile, Praveen Kumar will be a part of the Delhi team in the IPL.

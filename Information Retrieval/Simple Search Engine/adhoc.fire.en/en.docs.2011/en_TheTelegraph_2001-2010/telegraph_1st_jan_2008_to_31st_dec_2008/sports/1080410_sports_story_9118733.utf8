                                                                                                                                                                                                     Younis furious at ICC grilling
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                                  Shoaib has also been reportedly quizzed		    
	Calcutta/Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Nasim Ashraf and chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed intervened and stopped senior batsman Younis Khan from leaving the ongoing series against Bangladesh midway after the player was reportedly upset over the manner in which an ICC anti-corruption official interviewed him.         
	Sources said Younis was angry because he was told by the PCB that some ICC officials wanted to talk to him and would come to see him at the team hotel.         
	When Younis went to meet the ICC official thinking he was from the development side he was surprised to see that everything was being taped and shot on camera. It was then he learnt that it was an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) investigation interview, sources said.         
	Emerging from the interview, Younis had a heated exchange with some senior PCB officials on why they had not informed him in advance about the purpose of the meeting.         
	An angry Younis then decided to return home after the first match but Ashraf stepped in and defused the situation.         
	The ICC on Wednesday said its ACSU interviewed Younis, Danish Kaneria and Umar Gul to gain specific information in Lahore this week.         
	The ICC, however, did not comment on whether the officer had also quizzed banned fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar but sources said ICCs Alan Peacock spoke to Shoaib in a hotel in Lahore.         
	Peacock is conducting his activities very secretively. He met with Shoaib and Younis in the hotel.         
	The ICC said in a statement that its officer spoke to three players to seek specific information on some issue on April 5 and 6.         
	The interviews took place in Lahore on April 5 and 6. The purpose of these interviews was to seek specific information, the release said.         
	The ACSU has confirmed that the information was provided by the players, it said.         
	The ICC also clarified the interviews were not in relation to any alleged breach of the ICC Code of Conduct.

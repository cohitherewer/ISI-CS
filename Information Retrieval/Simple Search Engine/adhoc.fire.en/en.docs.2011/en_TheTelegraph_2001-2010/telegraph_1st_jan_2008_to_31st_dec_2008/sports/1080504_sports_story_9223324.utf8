	Rome: An Italian second division match between Treviso and Grosseto was suspended on Saturday after a policewoman shot herself outside the ground in an apparent suicide attempt, police said.    
	The policewoman was in hospital in a serious condition while another policewoman who tried to intervene was slightly hurt, they added.

	Rome: Juventus captain Alessandro del Piero believes he deserves an Italy recall for Euro 2008 after scoring 18 goals in Serie A this season.    
	The World Cup winner has not played for his country since giving a poor performance in a goalless qualifying match against France in September.    
	But calls to bring him back have been mounting as the forward has been instrumental in helping third-placed Juventus secure a Champions League qualification slot on their return to the top flight after relegation over the 2006 match-fixing scandal.    
	I think I have deserved (a place at) the European championships with a beautiful season, Del Piero told Juves in-house TV channel.         
	Jalandhar: Former Olympian Pargat Singh on Saturday hailed the inclusion of Sandeep Singh in Indias Azlan Shah Cup squad and said though there is precious little time for a wholesale change, inducting the drag-flicker was a good move by the ad-hoc selection committee.    
	It is obvious that due to lack of sufficient time, it is not possible to make more changes in the India team for the Azlan Shah Cup, but Sandeeps inclusion is a good decision by the ad-hoc committee, Pargat said.        
	San Francisco: Olympic gold medallist Antonio Pettigrew was identified Friday in government court documents as a user of illegal and banned performance-enhancing drugs.    
	The gold medallist in the 4x400 relay at the 2000 Sydney Olympics is one of seven elite athletes once trained by Trevor Graham who are scheduled to testify their former coach set them up with performance-enhancing drugs.    
	Grahams trial is scheduled to start May 19. The government does not intend to call Grahams most famous athletes, Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, but both disgraced runners still will loom large at Grahams trial.        
	London: McLarens Heikki Kovalainen said he had no fears about returning to racing in next weeks Turkish Grand Prix after his big crash in Spain last weekend.

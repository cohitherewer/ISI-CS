                                                                                                                                                                                           Md. Sp. deserving winners: Manoranjan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: An overwhelmed Shabbir Ali credited his foreign players  Mike Okoro and Man-of-the-Match Theodore Sunday  for their convincing 3-1 win against East Bengal in the Calcutta Football League on Sunday.         
	He was unable to recall when Mohammedan Sporting last beat East Bengal by such a big margin.         
	Emphasising the need for quality foreign recruits in Indian football, Shabbir said: I think my foreign players made the difference today. I would not like to undermine the efforts of the Indian players, though They too played well.         
	On Mohammedan Sportings dominance over an East Bengal team that looked strong on paper, Shabbir said: I think they played well. They created a few good chances but were unlucky when the ball hit the cross-bar.         
	With my limited resources and without a proper sponsor, I think we played very well today. I believe we are in a very good position after three matches.         
	Like his coach, Sunday, too, spoke about the importance of this win. I dont think it was my best performance. But it was a very important match for us So the win against East Bengal is very crucial, said Sunday.         
	Sunday was denied a hattrick after Okoro converted a 90th minute penalty kick. Asked about it, the smiling Liberian said: Its not a problem I wouldnt like to score my hattrick from a penalty, so it is not important. I am very happy with my performance.         
	A visibly dejected Manoranjan Bhattacharya admitted that Mohammedan Sporting were the deserving winners.         
	Though our ball possession was more, the foreigners in their side made the big difference.         
	We are lacking a positive striker. Some of our players dont have the quality to win these big games. But we didnt play like losing 1-3, Manoranjan said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Borg changes mind, roots for Roger
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Borg changes mind, roots for Roger
                  Bjorn Borg at Wimbledon on Friday                     
	London: Five-time former Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg has changed his mind about who will win this years championship, veering towards Roger Federer instead of Rafael Nadal.         
	After the French Open when Nadal thrashed Federer in the final losing only four games, Borg, the last man to win both tournaments in the same year, said he thought Nadal would win Wimbledon for the first time. But after watching both men play unbelievable tennis to reach the semi-finals, he told reporters: Roger is playing perfect tennis. Before the tournament I picked Nadal just to pick someone else... Nadal has improved his game a lot since last year but if Roger plays the way he has until the semi-finals its going to be tough to beat Roger.         
	Borg was speaking before Fridays semi-finals.         
	Borg said Federer was brimming with confidence and Nadal, beaten finalist for the last two years, had improved immensely on grass. After winning the French Open on claycourt, the Spaniard quickly adjusted to the slick surface by capturing the Queens Club title a week later. Nadal looked like he had been practising on grass for a month... for me it was impossible to get used to the grass that quickly, Borg said.         
	In Paris, Borg said Federer had a bad match. But this is his home field. In the final, he added: Im going to be there and I hope we are going to see another unbelievable final like we did last year.

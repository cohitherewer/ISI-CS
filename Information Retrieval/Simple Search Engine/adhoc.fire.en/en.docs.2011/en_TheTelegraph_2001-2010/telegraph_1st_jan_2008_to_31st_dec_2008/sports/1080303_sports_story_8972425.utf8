The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal, Bagan in contrasting moods 
                                                   East Bengal, Bagan in contrasting moods 
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira on Sunday rested his key players on the eve of their final group match against Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting.         
	Oozing confidence to make the semi-finals, the Brazilian coach hinted that on Monday he would retain the XI, which drubbed Mohammedan Sporting 3-0. Pereira had instead a session with his second-string players at the club ground.         
	We have been playing matches without any rest since the I-League. So I decided to rest the players who had played against Mohammedan Sporting, he said.         
	Mohun Bagan, who have three points from two outings, either need a win or draw to qualify for the semi-finals.         
	Pereira pleaded ignorance about the strengths and weaknesses of Mondays rivals but insisted that his team would play a win.         
	I really have no idea about them I have planned nothing but the boys will play for a win, he said.         
	Things, however, would be tougher for East Bengal as they face the tournament favourites Santos FC of South Africa. Aloke Mukherjee will have a mountain to climb with key striker Edmilson likely to miss due to ankle injury.         
	Edmilson skipped Sundays practice session.         
	East Bengal need to beat the South Africans at least by three goals to stay alive.         
	M. Suresh is likely to replace M. Bolaji at the backline while Ghanaian Abeeku Gaisie will partner Syed Rahim Nabi upfront.         
	Anupam Sarkar, Abhra Mondal and Soumik De and Mehrajuddin Wadao will man the defence with Alvito DCunha, Jayanta Sen, Dipankar Roy and Mehtab Hussain forming the mid-field.         
	Mohammedan Sporting will face Churchill Brothers in the days other match. Shabbir Alis team will miss Tapan Giri (knee injury), K. Kulothungan (fever) and Naseem Akhtar (knee-injury).         
	We are tired after playing so many matches. Above all we have only one foreigner (Mike Okoro) It will be difficult for us, Ali said.

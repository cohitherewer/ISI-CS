                                                   Maradona sorry for Hand of God goal

           
	London: Argentina football legend Diego Maradona apologised in an interview on Thursday for his infamous Hand of God goal in the 1986 World Cup quarter final that cost England a shot at the trophy. 
    
	Speaking to a British tabloid, Maradona, who scored both goals in the 2-1 win over England more than 20 years ago, said that if he could go back in time and change history, he would. 
    
	Maradonas first goal in the quarter final in Mexico was deemed by the referee to be a legitimate header past England goalkeeper Peter Shilton but replays confirmed he had illegally punched the ball in with his hand. 
    
	That controversy has, in England at least, long overshadowed Maradonas superb solo second goal, which saw him dribble past five England players before shooting past Shilton. 
    
	He said: If I could apologise and go back and change history I would. But the goal is still a goal. Argentina became world champions and I was the best player in the world. I cannot change history. All I can do now is move on. 
    
	Englands anger at Maradonas handball was further inflamed when, immediately after the match, he said his opening goal was the work of the Hand of God. 
    
	Maradona, who suffered from a drug problem, also took a swipe at fellow-legend Pele saying that if he had never taken cocaine there would be no debate about who was the best footballer the world had ever seen ... Everyone would say me. 
    
	If I had never touched cocaine, I would have been three times as good a player, he added. 
    
	In a wide-ranging interview, Maradona said that he was looking for footballing jobs in England, but noted that no firm discussions had taken place with any clubs. 
    
	He also criticised former England national team captain David Beckham, whom he described as just a good player, nothing more ... Hes not a great player  he doesnt belong to the superior group of players. There are hundreds of Beckhams playing football all over the world.

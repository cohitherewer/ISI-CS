                                                   42nd career title for Bhupathi

           
	Memphis: Mahesh Bhupathi ended his one-and-a-half-year drought of ATP doubles title by winning the Morgan Keegan Championships here. 
    
	Bhupathi and his partner Mark Knowles of Bahamas, who were top seeded, defeated Thai twins Sanchai and Sonchat Ratiwatana 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in an hour and 16 minutes at the $769,000 hard court event on Sunday night. 
    
	The India-Bahamas duo, playing their 10th tournament since teaming up after the US Open last year, did not drop a single set in the event en route to their first title together. 
    
	They had reached the semi-finals of the 2008 Australian Open. 
    
	For Bhupathi, it was 42nd career title while Knowles added the 48th career crown to his kitty. Bhupathi last won a doubles title in August 2007 in US, alongside Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia. 
    
	Bhupathi and Knowles now head for Dubai where the duo is seeded fourth. Other Indian in action would be Rohan Bopanna and Leander Paes who would be playing alongside their respective partners.

	Glasgow: Jeev Milkha Singh squandered his last chance to qualify for next weeks British Open, carding a final round one-over 72 in the Barclays Scottish Open to sign off tied ninth in the $5.92 million event (as briefly reported in Mondays Late City edition).         
	The seasoned Indian pro needed to finish among the top-five to get a berth in the British Open but a late slump put paid to his hopes and he finished with a total of seven-under 277.

	His backward journey turned out to be disappointing as he went birdie-less, besides compounding his woes with a bogey-brace on the 12th and 13th.         
	At the top, Graeme McDowell (68) clinched the title by two strokes after totalling 13-under 271 with James Kingston (66) finishing second.         
	Richard Green (69) and Migeul Angel Jimenez (69) were tied for the third spot with totals of 10-under 274. (PTI)

                                                                                                                                                                                           Pargat is named manager
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Former India captain Pargat Singh on Wednesday was named the manager of the Indian hockey team for the Azlan Shah Cup in Malaysia.         
	Pargats appointment came after chief coach Joaquim Carvalho, manager R.K. Shetty and three other players decided to skip the Malaysia tournament and return home at the end of the four-nation meet in Australia.         
	The chairman of the selection committee, Aslam Sher Khan said that Pargat had to be rushed as the Indian team was left without a manager in Azlan Shah. He said that it was surprising that Carvalho and Shetty left for India without informing the selection committee.         
	The three players  Tushar Khandekar, Baljit Singh and Sameer Buxla  who returned home on Tuesday, were originally not in the squad for the Azlan Shah tournament, but according to Khan, the team management in Australia was informed about their inclusion.         
	We had sent the team list to Shetty after the selection. Carvalho and Shetty did not inform anybody, the chief selector said.         
	We dont want to create further trouble for the team. Let the team come back, then we will speak to players and the team management.

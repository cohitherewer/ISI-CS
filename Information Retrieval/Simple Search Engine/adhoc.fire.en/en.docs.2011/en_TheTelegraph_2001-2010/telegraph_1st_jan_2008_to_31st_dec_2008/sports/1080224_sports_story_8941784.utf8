	Calcutta: Germanys Alexander Satschko cantered to the Coal India ITF Mens Futures title, blanking out Korean challenger Nam Hyun-woo 6-0, 6-0 at the Jaidip Mukerjea Tennis Academy on Saturday.         
	So clinical was the Germans performance that the bearded winner barely broke a sweat before decimating his challenger in 50 minutes.         
	Former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray gave away the prizes with football great P.K. Banerjee gracing the occasion as a guest. Satschko was richer by $1950 and Nam got $1350.         
	Playing a flawless tennis  characterised by powerful serves, returns and intelligent drop shots  Satschko raced to 4-0 in the first set in no time. Add to this the Germans unusual way of mediation during breaks  reading a piece of paper, containing motivational mantras, while sitting on the chair  and he immediately looked a perfect contrast to the nervous Korean.         
	The Korean, so mesmerised by the top seeds complete game, simply couldnt recover from that early onslaught. It was reflected in Nams game in that the Korean failed to hold on to his serves on a few occasion at 40-30 or 40-15.         
	I want to break into the top 200 this year. Todays win is just the right step towards my goal, Satschko, who will play in the Delhi leg of the ITF Mens Futures, said after the match.         
	Stressing that the weather had helped his game, he added: I was confident throughout this tournament. The final was no exception.         
	Explaining his strategy in the final, he continued: I wanted to put pressure on him (Nam) right from the beginning Happy that everything clicked for me today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cole pulls out with injury

  -   Capello turns to Bridge; Terry fails fitness test         HENRY WINTER            David Beckham during Englands training session in Minsk, Belarus, on Tuesday                                 
	England fans will be treated to a glimpse of life without Ashley Cole after the controversial left-back, jeered at Wembley on Saturday, withdrew on Monday from Fabio Capellos team to face Belarus in Minsk on Wednesday. A far inferior full-back, Wayne Bridge, replaces the hamstrung Cole.         
	On a day of discouraging injury bulletins emanating from London Colney, John Terry failed a fitness test on his troublesome back, meaning that Matthew Upson will continue to deputise at centre-half alongside Rio Ferdinand, who retains the armband. Robert Green also pulled out with a knee problem, leaving England a mishap in training away from having only one fit keeper. Capello was contemplating call-ups on Monday night.         
	For all the disappointing news about Terry, it is Coles surprise exit that stirred the most interest, prompting speculation that he had withdrawn in a fit of pique at the boos he endured during the 5-1 victory over Kazakhstan. But England sources confirm the hamstring injury is genuine. Anyone with any understanding of Coles psychological make-up knows he is too self-regarding to worry about criticism from the terraces.         
	The loss of Cole is undoubtedly frustrating for Capello. Englands coach is a huge admirer of the Chelsea man, enthusing that Cole is so fit and adventurous that he is almost a left-winger. If Capello does tuck the right-footed Steven Gerrard in on the left on Wednesday, England will need a high-class overlapping full-back even more, and Bridge is nowhere near Coles calibre.         
	Cole is being urged by the more sensible people in his life to tackle his pockmarked relationship with England fans. Terry, Coles captain with club and country, could have an important role to play in making Cole appreciate how damaging the current situation is.         
	Terry himself will be missed here. It is a blow to lose John but I guess it is a hazard of the game, remarked Upson, who argued that the England captain was bound to suffer injuries because of the way he threw himself into such a demanding task.         
	Its a hazard of the position and there comes a time where, especially as a defender, youre going to have to put your body on the line, and John does that every week, added Upson.         
	Centre-half has been a position where England have been traditionally strong but with Ledley King reporting lame too often, Sol Campbell ageing and Jamie Carragher retired, the cupboard is less well stocked. Jonathan Woodgate, one of the few players to emerge with any credit from Tottenhams recent travails, could be forgiven for wondering why Capello overlooked him.         
	The Italian rates Upson, who sounded in confident form on Monday, claiming that Terry and Ferdinand had no God-given right for a starting place anyway. I dont think being the captain or vice-captain automatically means you are going to be picked, said the West Ham defender.         
	Things change very quickly in football, be it injury or loss of form. I am capable of stepping in and doing a good job.         
	One image Upson hopes to avoid is the sight of Alexander Hleb breaking from Belarus midfield, running at Englands depleted defence. Hampered by an ankle injury, the Barcelona player is racing against time to be fit for Wednesday, an alarming situation for his coach.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia carries Bagan forward
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bhutia carries Bagan forward
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jose Ramirez Barreto congratulates Bhaichung Bhutia after the goal on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia scored a crafty goal as Mohun Bagan beat Mahindra United 1-0 in their Round X ONGC I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday.         
	The green and maroon brigade thus won their fifth match on the trot and climbed to the second spot on the league table with 18 points. Mahindra United are placed ninth with nine from 10 matches. Sporting Clube de Goa with 22 points from an equal number of outings are the leaders.         
	An opportunistic Bhutia put Mohun Bagan on their way just a minute after the lemon break when he latched on to a deflected ball from a Lalkamal Bhowmick pass and slotted home a volley.         
	Mohun Bagans Monday opponents however, would be ruing the several missed opportunities that they had in the evenly poised encounter. While an off-colour Sushil Kumar Singh squandered an open chance in the first minute, N.P. Pradeeps fiery right-footer in the 13th minute was brilliantly dealt with by Peter Odafe.         
	Bagan, after their initial defensive approach, were rallied by Jose Ramirez Barreto and a clinical Bhutia upfront. Though their defensive mindset at times proved too threatening for them, some brilliant saves by goalie Sangram Mukherjee along with timely interventions from Deepak Kumar Mondal, N.S. Manju and Peter Odafe saw them through.         
	They however, had their share of the chances too. An ambitious 15th minute long-ranger from veteran Barreto that flew over the target by a few centimetres followed by a couple of set-piece moves summed up Bagans first-half play.         
	Barreto was brought down in the top box while attempting to tear through the Mahindra defence.         
	 It was in the 57th minute that the Brazilian was brought down after an ambitious run dodging past a couple of Mahindra defenders. Referee P.K. Bose however, overruled Bagans appeal for penalty.         
	A goal down, Mahindra coach Derek Pereira injected fresh blood. While Mohammed Rafi came in for Sushil Kumar Singh, Paresh Shivalkar and Edeh Chidi replaced Sukhwinder Singh and Sunil Kumar respectively  however the substitutes failed to make any difference on the scoreboard.

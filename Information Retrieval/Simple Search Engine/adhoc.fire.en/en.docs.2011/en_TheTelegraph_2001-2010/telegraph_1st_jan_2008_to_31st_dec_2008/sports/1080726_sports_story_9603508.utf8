	Mumbai: What could turn out to be a bitter situation for BCCI, it has come to light that master batsman Sachin Tendulkar has played alongside rebel player Dinesh Mongia for Lashings World XI in two matches in England last month.         
	Tendulkar and Mongia had opened the innings for Lashings against St Bedes school Headmasters XI at the school ground in Essex on June 27. While Tendulkar sizzled with an 84-ball knock of 98, Mongia hit 72 off 41 balls, according to the club website.         
	Tendulkar had batted at number two and the left-handed Mongia at number three on June 24 for the same side, making 32 and 66 respectively against Eastbourne College XI at the latters ground.         
	Interestingly, Mumbai left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni was also part of the Lashings squad that also contained New Zealands ICL rebel Chris Harris. (PTI)

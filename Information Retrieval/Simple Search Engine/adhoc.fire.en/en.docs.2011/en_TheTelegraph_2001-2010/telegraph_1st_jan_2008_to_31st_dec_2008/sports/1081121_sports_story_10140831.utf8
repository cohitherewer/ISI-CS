            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohammedan Sportings Sovan Chakraborty vies for the ball with Ranty Martins of Dempo at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting were back on the losing track on Thursday. Shabbir Alis boys fought harder than expected against Dempo but lost 0-2 here at the Salt Lake Stadium, making their win against Vasco last Friday just one bright spark in an otherwise gloomy I-League campaign.         
	The city team had their moments but the difference in class was palpable. Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Tharangachan Tungshang was almost as good as he was in their last match. His acrobatic save stopped Dempo from scoring in the second minute itself but he could do little in the eighth minute when he fisted away Sameer Naiks cross from the right and an unmarked Anthony Pereira shot the ball in to make it 1-0.         
	Ranty Martins, after twice coming close to scoring, found luck in the 39th minute. It was one of those moments when the Mohammedan Sporting defence forgot to react. Roberto Mendes DSilvas shot off Joaquim Abranches cross was fisted away by Tharangachan.         
	The ball came to Ranty. The defenders, to everyones astonishment, did not go for the final tackle even though it was inside the box. Taking advantage of an unmoved defence, Ranty made it 2-0.

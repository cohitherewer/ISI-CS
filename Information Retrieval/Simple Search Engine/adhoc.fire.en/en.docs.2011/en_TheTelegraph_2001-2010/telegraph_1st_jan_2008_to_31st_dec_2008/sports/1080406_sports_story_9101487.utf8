	Ahmedabad: Korbo, lorbo, jitbo re happens to be the Kolkata Knight Riderss theme song in the upcoming Indian Premier League. The Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchises captain, Sourav Ganguly, stood alone chanting this tune at the Motera on Saturday. Unlike the television promo, there was no chorus behind to make it heard across the ground as India suffered batting blues for the second time in three days, losing the second Test by an innings and 90 runs.         
	The former India captains majestic 87 and his 110-run stand with Mahendra Singh Dhoni (52) in the end proved to be an attempt to delay the inevitable. Indias last innings defeat at home also came against the same opponents, led by the late Hansie Cronje, in Bangalore in 2000.         
	If South Africa needed just one session to start the mayhem for Indian batsmen, they required just a single day to complete the rituals, rendering Indias future in this Future Cup bleak. Outpaced, outclassed and outwitted, India will head to Kanpur for the final Test with little positives from the Motera but lots of concerns to ponder over. To make matters worse, Sachin Tendulkar has been ruled out of that match too.         
	Although overnight rain delayed the days action by only half an hour, South Africa decided they had had enough runs to test Indias patience in the next three days. So, against the Everest of a challenge, Virender Sehwag and Wasim Jaffer set out to defy the odds.         
	And what a cracker of a start it was! Facing the usual chin music, Sehwag drummed up a different tune, sending Dale Steyn over fine-leg boundaries twice in the first over. It was a ferocious reply to the colossal task and when the triple centurion of the previous Test flicked Makhaya Ntini around his pads, a marvellous counter-punch promised to gather over the Motera sky.         
	Ntini, however, nipped it in the bud, his incoming delivery catching Sehwag in line with middle and leg stumps. But once the buccaneering Sehwags little drama was over, things became complicated for his teammates.         
	India were looking for a miracle but, instead, they were made to face a Morne Morkel.The lanky speedster, who thundered down one delivery well past 150 kmph, sent shivers down the home teams spine. Rahul Dravid tried to fend off a rising delivery, and ended up managing an edge to third slip.         
	In the next over, AB de Villiers was at it again, this time he scooped up the catch from the hesitant Jaffers bat, giving Jacques Kallis his first wicket of the match. It was 70 for three and another indescribable mayhem was all set to take place on the not-looking-so-menacing-anymore strip. As it was back to the continuation of a long, boring and familiar theme, Souravs entry was immediately greeted with a well-orchestrated chin music. With three slips, two gullies, short cover and forward short-leg, Ntini and Steyn welcomed him with a flurry of boundaries.         
	Driving Steyn between the slip and gully signalled a determined reply from the former India captain and when spinner Paul Harris was introduced for the first time in the match, to start the 32nd over, he gradually got into his groove.         
	With VVS Laxman (35) showing glimpses of his ethereal Eden fight back, a partnership of substance between him and Sourav started developing. Laxmans back-to-back boundaries off the fiery Morkel smacked of character and intent, which could be culled straight from the book of his knock against Waugh amp; Co. seven years ago. However, like Sehwag, Laxman too proved to be a case in point that good dreams dont last long. Against the run of play, Morkel provided the breakthrough as the batsman, playing away from his body, snicked one behind the wickets.         
	In Dhonis company, Sourav then took centre stage. In punches towards the point region, deft works around his pads and signature drives through cover, balance, rhythm, confidence and shot selection acted in harmony as the left-hander took up the challenge to guide his teams destiny.         
	The first sign of a confirmation that the clouds were clearing from his horizon came in the 47th over when Sourav swept Harris brilliantly for his fifth boundary.         
	The battle intensified at the other end as well. Steyn banged a 145kmph-delivery in short, Dhoni boldly went for the hook, Ntini, patrolling fine-leg, conceded a boundary, misjudging the trajectory of the ball. A furious Steyn dished out another bouncer and the vice-captain swivelled again but missed it.         
	Umpire Tony Hill eventually brought down the curtains on this gripping contest, responding to the South Africans caught-behind appeal when Sourav slashed and missed Steyns fullish delivery. Perhaps the New Zealand umpire was deceived by the convergence of the ball leaving the bat and the bat hitting the ground in a follow-through action.         
	Little doubt was left at that time that the Indias rites would be completed inside three days of the match.

                                                   An attempt to discredit Leander, says Naresh 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian squads rebellion against Davis Cup captain Leander Paes has taken the citys tennis fraternity by utter surprise. While former captain Naresh Kumar found no merit in the allegations, former coach Akhtar Ali called for an immediate end to the tussle. Arjuna Award recipient Jaidip Mukerjea, however, said the players wouldnt have been up in arms had there not been some solid reason. The following are excerpts of what they had to say (alphabetically):         
	AKHTAR ALI: What has happened is not good for Indian tennis. This will end up reducing our chances against Japan. I have been associated with the Davis Cup since 1958 and never have I seen such an open revolt. Its our duty to put country first. And in the larger interest of the game, the players must put aside their differences and give their best against Japan.         
	NARESH KUMAR: The fulcrum of the whole thing was that Paes didnt nominate Prakash on Day I. Hardly a reason. It is for the captain to assess the situation. Prakash cant insist that he would play. Paes had a plan that clearly clicked. Dustov was a shambles in the deciding tie whereas Prakash appeared fresh. It was the captains call and he called it right. We won. I dont see what all the fuss is about. Paes is answerable to no one. In fact, this is an extension of the rivalry between Paes and Bhupathi. It is Bhupathi who has whipped up the issue. The whole thing is an attempt to discredit Paes. I dont see any merit in the allegations at all. AITA can replace Paes with a non-playing captain but he must be in the team. And lastly, dragging Rastogi into the mess is unfortunate.         
	JAIDIP MUKERJEA: The situation is very sad. In 1999, when I was the captain, Leander wanted me out and spoke to R.K. Khanna about it. I stepped down. I dont know what has happened behind the scenes but Prakash and Bopanna are nice guys. They wont bring an allegation without a reason. I think its always better to have a non-playing captain.

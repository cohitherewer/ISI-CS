The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Romania hope to tame Dutch
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Romania hope to tame Dutch
                                  
	Lausanne: Romania always thought their best chance of a win in group C would be against Netherlands and on Tuesday they can seal a quarter final place at Euro 2008 with a victory over the already-qualified Dutch.         
	A draw in Berne and a stalemate between World Cup winners Italy and runners-up France in the other group game would also be enough for Romania to secure a quarter final with Spain.         
	The Dutch have already won the group with six points, followed by Romania on two with France and Italy on one apiece, although they have said they would try their hardest to win.         
	But Romania are confident they can beat Netherlands, having won 1-0 in Constanta last October after drawing 0-0 in Rotterdam in March to reach Euro 2008 as qualifying group winners.         
	Having started with a goalless draw against France, Romania have achieved their goal so far and can finish the job against a Dutch side certain to feature changes after winning the group with superb 3-0 and 4-1 victories over Italy and France.         
	Romanian journalists turned up at the Netherlands training session in Lausanne on Sunday with flags and team shirts bearing the plea Let us win on the front in Dutch. It was not clear if Netherlands coach Marco van Basten had seen them.         
	At his news conference, the Dutchman hinted he would take no risks with defender Andre Ooijer and midfielder Nigel de Jong, who have been booked and would be banned for their quarter final with Russia or Sweden if they got another yellow card.

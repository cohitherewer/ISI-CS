	New Delhi: The Indian pair of Harsh Mankad and Ashutosh Singh pulled off an upset and tamed second seeds Adam Feeney and Purav Raja in straight sets to move into the final of the mens doubles event in the ATP Challenger tennis tournament here on Thursday.         
	The Indian pair dominated throughout to walk away with a facile 6-4, 6-1 victory to set up a summit clash with top seeded Indo-American pair of Mustafa Ghouse and Brendan Evans, who beat Alexandre Kudryavtsev and Ilia Marchenko 7-5, 6-1.         
	Meanwhile in singles, second seed Gilles Muller became the casualty of the lone upset in the quarter finals on Thursday.         
	Seventh seed Alexandre Kudryavtsev of Russia edged out Muller 7-5, 4-6, 7-6(2) after an intense battle.         
	Not that other seeded players found it a smooth sailing. Top seed Yen-Hsun Lu of Taipei toiled in the middle before getting past Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi 5-7, 6-3, 7-5, while fourth seed Go Soeda of Japan scraped past Brazilian Ricardo Mello 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.         
	In the semi-finals on Friday, Lu will meet Spaniard Guillermo Alcaide who pipped Thomas Oger 7-6(2), 4-6, 6-1, while Soeda faces Kudryavtsev.           (PTI)

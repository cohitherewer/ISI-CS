  - Swiss skips back a few steps, impossibly fast, to hit a forehand out of backhand corner!       David Foster Wallace              Federer                            
	Almost anyone who loves tennis and follows the mens tour on television has, over the last few years, had what might be termed Federer Moments. These are times, as you watch the young Swiss play, when the jaw drops and eyes protrude and sounds are made that bring spouses in from other rooms to see if youre OK. The Moments are more intense if youve played enough tennis to understand the impossibility of what you just saw him do.         
	Weve all got our examples. Here is one. Its the finals of the 2005 US Open, Federer serving to Andre Agassi early in the fourth set. Theres a medium-long exchange of groundstrokes, one with the distinctive butterfly shape of todays power-baseline game. Federer and Agassi yanking each other from side to side, each trying to set up the baseline winner...until suddenly Agassi hits a hard heavy cross-court backhand that pulls Federer way out wide to his left side, and Federer gets to it but slices the stretch backhand short, a couple feet past the service line, which of course is the sort of thing Agassi dines out on, and as Federers scrambling to reverse and get back to center, Agassis moving in to take the short ball on the rise.         
	He smacks it hard right back into the same left corner, trying to wrong-foot Federer, which in fact he does  Federers still near the corner but running toward the centerline, and the balls heading to a point behind him now, where he just was, and theres no time to turn his body around. And Agassis now following the shot in to the net at an angle from the backhand side...what Federer now does is somehow instantly reverse thrust and sort of skip backward three or four steps, impossibly fast, to hit a forehand out of his backhand corner, all his weight moving backward, and the forehand is a topspin screamer down the line past Agassi at net, who lunges for it but the balls past him.         
	It flies straight down the sideline and lands exactly in the deuce corner of Agassis side, a winner  Federers still dancing backward as it lands. And theres that familiar little second of shocked silence from the New York crowd before it erupts, and John McEnroe with his color mans headset on TV says (mostly to himself, it sounds like), How do you hit a winner from that position? And hes right: given Agassis position and world-class quickness, Federer had to send that ball down a two-inch pipe of space in order to pass him, which he did, moving backwards, with no set-up time and none of his weight behind the shot. It was impossible. It was like something out of The Matrix.         
	I dont know what-all sounds were involved, but my spouse says she hurried in and there was popcorn all over the couch and I was down on one knee and my eyeballs looked like novelty-shop eyeballs.         
	Anyway, thats one example of a Federer Moment, and that was merely on TV  and the truth is that TV tennis is to live tennis pretty much as video porn is to the felt reality of human love.         
	Journalistically speaking, there is no hot news to offer you about Roger Federer. He is, at 25, the best tennis player currently alive. Maybe the best ever. Bios and profiles abound. 60 Minutes did a feature on him just last year.         
	Anything you want to know about Mr. Roger Federer  his background, his home town of Basel, Switzerland, his parents sane and unexploitative support of his talent, his junior tennis career, his early problems with fragility and temper, his beloved junior coach, how that coachs accidental death in 2002 both shattered and annealed Federer and helped make him what he now is, Federers 39 career singles titles, his eight Grand Slams, his unusually steady and mature commitment to the girlfriend who travels with him (which on the mens tour is rare) and handles his affairs (which on the mens tour is unheard of), his old-school stoicism and mental toughness and good sportsmanship and evident overall decency, thoughtfulness and charitable largess  its all just a Google search away. Knock yourself out.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

                                                   IOA wants athletes to train in China

           
	New Delhi: In its bid to fetch maximum medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in the capital, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has made a proposal to train Indian athletes in China. 
    
	IOA president Suresh Kalmadi on Friday said that Indian athletes will be benefited by the great infrastructure and coaches if they train in China. The proposal will be followed up when he visits that country in April. 
    
	As a host country of 2010 Commonwealth Games, we want to win as many medals as possible. Our facilities will be in renovation for the Commonwealth Games during the next one or two years. So, I am proposing training of athletes in China for two years Kalmadi said. 
    
	New Delhi will stage the Beijing Olympic torch relay in April after the event was shifted from Mumbai.

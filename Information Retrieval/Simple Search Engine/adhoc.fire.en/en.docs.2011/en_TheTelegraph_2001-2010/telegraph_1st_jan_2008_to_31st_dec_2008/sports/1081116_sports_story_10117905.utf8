	London: Liverpool took full advantage of an early kick-off at Bolton Wanderers on Saturday, winning 2-0 to go three points clear at the top of the Premier League.         
	Dirk Kuyt nodded Liverpool in front midway through the first half from a precise Fabio Aurelio cross and Steven Gerrard wrapped up the points after the break with another header.         
	Arsenals title hopes suffered another blow as they were beaten 0-2 at home by Aston Villa, Gael Clichys own goal and Gabriel Agbonlahors strike condemning the Gunners to a fourth league defeat of the season.         
	Manchester United moved above Arsenal into third place on 24 points by thumping Stoke City 5-0 at Old Trafford with Cristiano Ronaldo twice on target for the champions.         
	Sunderland moved out of the bottom three with a 2-1 victory at Blackburn Rovers but Tottenham Hotspur are back in it after a 1-2 reverse at Fulham, manager Harry Redknapps first defeat in seven matches since taking over last month.         
	Ten-man Wigan Athletic drew 2-2 at Newcastle United while Portsmouth drew 0-0 at West Ham United.         
	Liverpool fielded a virtual second-string side when losing at Tottenham in the League Cup on Wednesday but were back at full strength as they outclassed Bolton.         
	The only surprise was that manager Rafael Benitez left striker Fernando Torres on the bench despite the Spanish hitman being fit again.         
	Dutchman Kuyt repaid Benitezs decision to start him instead of Torres with a majestic opener after 28 minutes, craning his neck to head in Aurelios cross.         
	Torres replaced Robbie Keane and it was his beautiful cross that allowed Gerrard to glance in Liverpools second goal with 17 minutes remaining.         
	Arsenal suffered an off-day at the Emirates against a Villa side pushing hard for a top-four place.         
	Villas Ashley Young had a first-half penalty saved by Manuel Almunia but the visitors took a deserved lead after 70 minutes when Clichy headed Youngs cross into his own net.         
	Agbonlahor capped a fine Villa display when he raced away, held off the challenge of William Gallas and fired a shot past Almunia. (Reuters)

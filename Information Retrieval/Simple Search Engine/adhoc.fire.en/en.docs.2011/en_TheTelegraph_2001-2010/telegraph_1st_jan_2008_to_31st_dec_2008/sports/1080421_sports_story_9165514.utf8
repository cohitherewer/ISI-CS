	Mumbai: Mark Boucher hit a brilliant 39 and shared a crucial 55-run partnership with compatriot Jacques Kallis to script a thrilling five-wicket win for Bangalore Royal Challengers over Mumbai Indians in their IPL Twenty20 encounter on Sunday.         
	Chasing 166 to win, the visitors weathered a clutch of wickets between the ninth and 14th overs to reach the target in 19.4 overs at the Wankhede Stadium. With this win, Challengers wiped off the bad memories of the 140-run defeat in their opening match against Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Boucher hit two sixes and four boundaries in his unbeaten 19-ball knock and weaved a 55-run partnership for the fifth-wicket with Kallis to ensure his team earn their first points in the tournament.         
	Earlier, skipper Rahul Dravid gave the innings the early momentum by hitting a quick-fire 32-run cameo.           (PTI)

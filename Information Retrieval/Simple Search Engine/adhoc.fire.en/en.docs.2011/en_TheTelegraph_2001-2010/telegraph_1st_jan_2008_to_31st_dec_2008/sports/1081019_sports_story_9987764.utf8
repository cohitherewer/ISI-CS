	London: Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott feels Sachin Tendulkar becoming the highest run-getter in Test cricket was inevitable but the feat does not make him a better player than Don Bradman.         
	Therell always be people who break records because they play more Test matches than ever, more one-day Internationals, he said. It was inevitable that people like Lara and Tendulkar would break records.         
	Boycott stated that great statistics alone do not make a player comparable to someone like Bradman. (PTI)

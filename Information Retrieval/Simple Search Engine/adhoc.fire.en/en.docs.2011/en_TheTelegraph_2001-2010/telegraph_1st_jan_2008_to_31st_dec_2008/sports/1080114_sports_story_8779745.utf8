                                                   Bangla stare at defeat

           
	Wellington: New Zealands pace bowlers ripped through Bangladeshs top order to leave the visitors staring at almost certain defeat at the close of play on the second day of the second Test on Sunday. 
    
	The visitors, who began their second innings 250 runs behind New Zealand after dismissing them for 393 earlier in the day at the Basin Reserve, crumbled to 51 for five in their second innings, still 199 runs away from making New Zealand bat again. 
    
	Habibul Bashar was on 21, while allrounder Shakib Al Hasan was with him on four. 
    
	Bangladesh will be further hampered on Monday by the knowledge that recognised opener Tamim Iqbal has a broken thumb after dropping a catch on Sunday and may not be able to bat at all in their second innings.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tax probe extends to Capellos family
                      
	Turin: An investigation into possible tax fraud by England manager Fabio Capello has been extended to his wife Laura Ghisi and two adult sons, Edoardo and Pier Filippo, prosecutors in Turin said on Tuesday.         
	I can confirm that Capellos wife and children are being investigated for the same charges, prosecutor Marco Gianoglio said.         
	He said that AS Roma President Franco Sensi and his daughters Maria Cristina and Rosella, who is the clubs general manager, were being probed for involvement too, along with Genoa President Enrico Preziosi.         
	In January the prosecutors said they were investigating whether Capello should have been paying Italian tax on money the coach was holding abroad.         
	Investigators said they checking to see whether millions of euros earned while he was coach of AS Roma (1999-2004) had gone undeclared.         
	Capello said in a statement on the English FA Website (www.thefa.com) in January that his finances were in order and he was not aware of any matters which would be of concern.         
	Last week Rome prosecutors said they were investigating Capello on suspicion of withholding information from court after he gave evidence in a trial of six men accused of fostering unfair competition through the use of threats or violence as part of Italys Gea World sports agency.         
	The 61-year-olds lawyers said in a statement they were confident everything regarding the Gea testimony will soon be completely cleared.                 (REUTERS)

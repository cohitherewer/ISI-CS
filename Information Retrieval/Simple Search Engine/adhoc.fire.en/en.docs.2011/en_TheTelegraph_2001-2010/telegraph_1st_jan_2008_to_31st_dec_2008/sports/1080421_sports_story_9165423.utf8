	Berlin: Italian Luca Toni struck twice to earn Bayern Munich a 2-1 extra-time win over Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on Saturday.         
	The victory gave the Bavarians a record 14th win in the competition and set up a likely domestic double.

	Bayern struggled to keep Dortmund at bay in extra-time before Italy striker Toni wrong-footed Dortmund goalkeeper Marc Ziegler in the 103rd minute to seal the victory with the 35th goal of his remarkable debut season in Germany.         
	Dortmund finished with 10 men after Jakub Blaszczykowski received a second booking in the 108th minute.         
	Bayern hold a 10-point lead in the Bundesliga with five matches to play and should go on to complete their third league and cup double in four seasons.

	It was the fourth successive match to feature two goals from Toni and made it a triumphant return to the Olympiastadion, where he was part of the Italy team that beat France to win the 2006 World Cup final.         
	In England, Aston Villa thrashed Birmingham City 5-1 on Sunday to take their goal tally to 15 in their last three Premier League games. John Carew and Ashley Young both scored twice for Villa to leave City stuck in the relegation zone with three matches left to save themselves.         
	Sunderland are still not safe after losing 0-2 at Newcastle United in the days second derby, Michael Owen scoring twice for Kevin Keegans resurgent side at St James Park.         
	Birmingham are third from bottom with 31 points, one behind Reading who sit just above the drop zone. Sunderland have 36.

	In Spain, Villarreal climbed above Barcelona into second in the Primera Liga with a 2-0 win over struggling Real Valladolid at the Madrigal on Sunday.         
	Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci sprinted onto Santi Cazorlas pass to open the scoring against the run of play in the first half and returned the favour for Cazorla to add the second just after the break.         
	Manuel Pellegrinis side moved on to 62 points, one ahead of Barcelona, who were held 0-0 at home by city rivals Espanyol on Saturday.         
	Leaders Real Madrid, with 69 points, can open a 10-point lead if they beat Racing Santander. Fourth-placed Atletico Madrid slipped to a 1-3 home defeat against Real Betis on Saturday.

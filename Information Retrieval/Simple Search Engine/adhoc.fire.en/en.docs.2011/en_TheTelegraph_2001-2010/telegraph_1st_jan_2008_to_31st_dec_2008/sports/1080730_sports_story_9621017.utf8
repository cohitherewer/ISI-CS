The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Winners want to start working at once
                                                                                                                                                                                           Winners want to start working at once
            OUR STAFF REPORTERS                                  The election campaign turned interesting on Tuesday with both camps coming out with pamphlets. Jagmohan Dalmiya rsquo;s, however, was the colourful one      
	Calcutta: In his hour of glory, Biswarup Dey was modesty personified. After what might be called a landslide victory to clinch one of the joint secretarys posts in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections, Dey said the time was not for celebration but to get down to work.         
	I would like to stress that there is nothing to celebrate this win. I feel thats a sheer wastage of time, Dey said in an instant reaction after his victory.         
	Asked whether the celebration will be postponed till Wednesday, Dey said: Tomorrow (Wednesday) we dont want to spoil time celebrating. Instead, we will start working for the improvement of Bengal cricket.         
	Bablu Ganguly, who handily beat his opponent Tushar Sarkar for the post of the treasurer, said he hadnt had time to sit down and think about where he fared best but accepted that the Dalmiya-factor boosted his chances. For the record, Ganguly polled 75 votes compared to Sarkars 43.         
	After the victory, former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) joint secretary Goutam Das Gupta dismissed the claims made by the Prasun camp that Dalmiyas return to power in the CAB would draw the BCCIs ire.         
	We dont believe in these allegations. Dalmiya is fighting his own battle with the BCCI, it has no relation with the CAB, Das Gupta said.         
	According to sources, the Dalmiya-factor weighed heavily on the incumbent group. The Prasun Mukherjee-led faction had relied heavily on the districts and institutional votes, and they didnt do too badly in those sections. But the club votes  comprising of A division and B division clubs  let them down badly.                 
	The Prasun group had completely misread the club votes. He almost got what he calculated from the districts and institutions, a district voter told The Telegraph on his way back from the AGM.         
	Incidentally, a couple of hours before the start of the 77th annual general meeting (AGM), the prevailing mood at the BC Roy Club House was jocular, with candidates from both factions at ease. But with every passing moment, both the warring camps felt more and more tense as the start of the AGM neared.         
	A lot of activity could be witnessed at the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) entrance as both camps made last-ditch efforts to win votes as the voters started reaching CAB. For the Jagmohan Dalmiya camp, the morning started a bit early on Tuesday. While one joint secretary candidate Arun Mitra visited the Kalighat Temple, the other aspirant, Biswarup Dey, made some last minute calls and sent text messages to the voters.         
	Its just like any other day for me. The only difference is that I came here (the CAB) a bit early to attend the AGM And to tell you the truth I am not at all tense, Mitra said before the AGM.

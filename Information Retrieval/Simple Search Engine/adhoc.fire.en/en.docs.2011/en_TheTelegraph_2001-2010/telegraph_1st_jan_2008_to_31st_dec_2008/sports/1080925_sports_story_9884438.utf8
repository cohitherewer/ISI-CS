            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Indian boxers came into their own Wednesday evening by ensuring three bronze medals on the second day of the 4th ASBC Asian Womens Boxing meet.         
	Kalpana Choudhury, L. Sarita Devi and Nagisetty Usha reached the last four of their respective categories. While Choudhury beat Boranbayeva Nargul of Kazakhstan 6-0 in the light flyweight (48 kg), Sarita Devi outclassed Le Thi Ngan Hang of Vietnam. The third triumph came through Usha in the featherweight (57 kg) category.         
	Playing from the red corner, she beat Chinese opponent Qin Jian 6-2.The three triumphs for India on Wednesday followed the twin disappointments of Tuesday, when Pranamika Borah lost to Dong Cheng of China 1-4 in the lightweight (60 kg), and Ibemcha Salam lost 0-8 to Ri Hyon Hwa of DPR Korea.         
	In the most cheered about bouts on the second day of the six-day event, home girl Choudhury prevailed over her Kazakh opponent with skill and power. She led 4-0 in the first round and earned two more points in the second round. The third round was, however, a barren affair with Choudhury playing a considerably open game.         
	She will, however, face a strong opponent in defending champion Ri Jong Hyang of DPR Korea in the semi-final.

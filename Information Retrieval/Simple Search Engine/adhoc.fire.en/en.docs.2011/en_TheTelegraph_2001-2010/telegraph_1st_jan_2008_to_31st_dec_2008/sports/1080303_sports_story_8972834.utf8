                                                     Batting with Sachin a dream: Rohit
            A STAFF REPORTER             Rohit Sharma at the SCG on Sunday                           
	Calcutta: Rohit Sharma on Sunday described his batting experience with Sachin Tendulkar as a dream, saying he played under the maestros instructions.         
	I was just two-year-old when Sachinpaaji made his international debut (in 1989), and since then he has been my idol. I didnt have many opportunities to bat with him and but it was like a dream today, Sharma said on television after Indias win over Australia at the SCG.         
	Sachinpaaji told me to curb my shots and play sensibly. He pointed out that four runs an over would be ideal and that we needed to keep the partnership going. We were also discussing about not taking any unnecessary risks against Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson, Sharma, who made 66 in the 123-run fourth-wicket stand, maintained.         
	The Mumbai duo survived a couple of run-out chances on Sunday and Sharma said he was desperate not to get Sachin out in the 90s.         
	I knew he was run out in the 90s on a few occasions in the past. So I was determined not to play my part in another such incident, Sharma added.         
	 The youngster said he was confident of doing well in Australia because the wickets here suit my style of batting.

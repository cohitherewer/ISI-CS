The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manager pleads ignorance
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Manager pleads ignorance
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta: Arindam Ganguly, who was the Team India manager during the recent Asia Cup in Pakistan, has expressed surprise at a report in a leading Urdu daily there that three Indian players had gone to a beach party on the night before the Cup final.         
	This is news to me Im not aware that any Indian player had a very late night on the eve of the Asia Cup final. So far, nobody from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has contacted me for my views either, Ganguly told The Telegraph.         
	BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah also said he wasnt aware of any such happening. The report is totally false and fabricated. I deny anything of that sort happening during the tour, said Shah.         
	According to the report, the BCCI is obtaining details about a beach party attended by Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma on the night before the Asia Cup final, which they eventually lost to Sri Lanka. The trio, apparently, spent the night at Karachis famous French beach with a couple of their local friends who had thrown a party for them.         
	The report, quoting sources, said Yuvraj, Rohit and Raina had gone to the beach with their friends immediately after attending the Asian Cricket Council awards ceremony at the Mohatta Palace.         
	Their friends had arranged a big party for them at the beach which is a hot-spot for those belonging to the upper crest of society. And the three players returned to their hotel early morning from the beach, the report said.         
	After a few hours the Indian team played Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup final, it added.         
	Incidentally, all three failed to score runs in the final.         
	Yuvraj was bowled for a second ball duck by Ajantha Mendis, while Raina (16) and Rohit (3) too fell to the Sri Lankan spinner, who took six for 13, to guide Sri Lanka to a thumping 100-run win.         
	The report went on to say the three players had a blast at the party, and as a result, they couldnt get proper rest the night before the final.

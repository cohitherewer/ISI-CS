                                                   Fans dont give a damn about Aussie record: Atherton 

      A STAFF REPORTER
              
	Calcutta: Former England captain Michael Atherton has said that the majority of Australian cricket lovers dont give a damn about their teams 16-match unbeaten run. 
    
	In his column for The Sunday Telegraph, Atherton wrote that Australians took little or almost no part in Ricky Ponting amp; Cos victory in Sydney. 
    
	The reaction in Australia this past week shows how deeply the notion of the spirit of cricket has woven itself into even the most macho of cricketing cultures. 
    
	The phone-ins, emails, polls and former greats from different eras and sports who have condemned Ricky Pontings team all suggest, as did Peter Roebuck, that it is possible to love ones country but not its cricket team. The majority took no pleasure in Australias victory. 
    
	The verdict on Sydney seems clear enough from the majority of cricket lovers. Australias 16-match unbeaten run doesnt matter a damn 
    
	The former England opener reiterated that sledging is not an integral part of the game, as it is perceived to be these days. 
    
	It seems that a tipping point has been reached as far as sledging is concerned, but the removal of this stain from the game will have to come from the players rather than the administrators. 
    
	It is up to the players, not the administrators, to remove sledging as defined as sustained abuse, deliberately designed to put an opponent off his game. 
    
	But Atherton, a veteran of 115 Tests, wrote Ponting isnt the man to do it. 
    
	Unfortunately, Ponting is not the man to do it. In 2005, Ponting arrived in England making sweet noises about his teams conduct; he wanted Australia to be winners and to be loved. 
    
	But he got a rude shock and in defeat he was roundly criticised on his return by former Australian captains who suggested he and his team had gone soft in the head. Since then the smiles have been replaced by snarls; being nice will always be associated with losing in Pontings mind. 
    
	And to Atherton, the time has come for the rest of the world to isolate the Australians for their bad behaviour, not just blindly follow them since they have been so successful. 
    
	The rest of the world needs to isolate Australia on this matter. Because Australia have been the worlds best team for the last decade and a half, the rest have tried to ape both the best and the worst of what Australia have brought to the table. 
    
	But it is time for the rest of the world to remember the previous generations greatest team  probably the greatest team of the modern era. 
    
	The West Indians under Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards played hard, won well, disintegrated their opponents mentally and physically  and never uttered a word. There were no better fast bowlers in my time than Malcolm Marshall and Curtly Ambrose, and none more silent. 
    
	The former England captain said cricket as a game has never been outside racism or similar afflictions that plague other games. 
    
	The phrase  Its not cricket  is one of the most remarkable marketing success stories of all time, especially when you consider the constant failure in reality of the players to live up to that ideal.

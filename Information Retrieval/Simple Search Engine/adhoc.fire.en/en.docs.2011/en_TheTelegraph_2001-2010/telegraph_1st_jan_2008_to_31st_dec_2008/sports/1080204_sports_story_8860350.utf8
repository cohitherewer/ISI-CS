                                                   Taylor tipped to be CA chairman in 2011

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Former captain Mark Taylor may take over as chairman of Cricket Australia (CA) in 2011. 
    
	According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Taylor, who is currently a director with CA, may present his candidature for the post after chairman-elect Jack Clarke, set to take over from incumbent Creagh Connor in October, steps down after a three-year term. 
    
	Clarke is seen as a tough-talking person, a departure from the soft approach taken by Connor and chief executive James Sutherland. 
    
	Theres a feeling that Jack might just be a disaster in India, with his loud, outgoing ways. Its going to become a very serious issue, the paper quoted a CA insider as saying. 
    
	It is believed that Taylor, who is a CA board director, is lining up a dash for the top post when Clarkes reign ends, likely in 2011. The chairmanship is an annual appointment. It is generally accepted that each chairman serves three years.

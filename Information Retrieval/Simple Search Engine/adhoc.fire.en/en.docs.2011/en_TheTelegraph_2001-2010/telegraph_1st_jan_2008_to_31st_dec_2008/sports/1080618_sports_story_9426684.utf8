	New Delhi: The national camp for Indian football teams tour of Portugal will now be held in Delhi, according to AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco. The camp is likely to start on June 23 or 24.         
	The camp, initially scheduled to be held at Goa, has been shifted out because of rainy season in the western state. National coach Bob Houghton, who is currently holidaying in Maldives, will join the camp in the capital next week.

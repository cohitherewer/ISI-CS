The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bryan Robson is back
                                                   Bryan Robson is back
                      
	Manchester: Former Manchester United captain Bryan Robson will rejoin the club as a global ambassador. Robson, who quit as Sheffield United manager last month, will initially work alongside Bobby Charlton for a year.         
	Since signing for the club in 1981, it has always been special to me, said Robson, who scored 97 goals in 434 appearances. I enjoyed the happiest and most memorable times of my career at Old Trafford and it will be great to play a role in making the club even more successful.         
	After two Premier League title victories, Robson left United in 1994 to join Middlesbrough as player and manager.           (AP)

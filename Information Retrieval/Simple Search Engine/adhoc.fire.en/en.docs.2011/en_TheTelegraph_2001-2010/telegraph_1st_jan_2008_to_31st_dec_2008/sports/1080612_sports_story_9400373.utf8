	Sweden suffer injury blow  
	Lugano: Sweden midfielder Christian Wilhelmsson is out of Euro 2008 because of a hamstring injury. Christian has torn a hamstring and will be out for the rest of the finals, team doctor Anders Valentin told reporters on Wednesday before adding the injury would take at least three weeks to heal. The Deportivo Coruna winger was hurt towards the end of Swedens 2-0 group D win over Greece in Salzburg on Tuesday.   
	Security focus         
	Vienna: Thursdays game between Germany and Croatia in Klagenfurt is a risk match for Euro 2008 security forces, according to an Austrian police consultant. After the detention of 157 mainly German fans in Klagenfurt on Sunday when their team beat Poland 2-0, the security focus will remain on Group B. Germany-Croatia is seen most certainly as a risk match. Poland-Austria (on Thursday) is hard to say though it could also be one, hooligan expert Harald Mathe said on Wednesday. This is the group where we are most likely to see such clashes, it is the highest risk group.         
	Italy desperate         
	Baden: Italys Euro 2008 campaign has started so badly that even beating Romania with a goal from keeper Gianluigi Buffon would be welcome, main striker Luca Toni said on Wednesday. A 0-3 defeat to Netherlands in their group C opener on Monday means the world champions would be eliminated if they lose Fridays game against the Romanians in Zurich. Even if Buffon scores against Romania, we need three points and thats that, Toni told a news conference at Italys base south of Vienna.

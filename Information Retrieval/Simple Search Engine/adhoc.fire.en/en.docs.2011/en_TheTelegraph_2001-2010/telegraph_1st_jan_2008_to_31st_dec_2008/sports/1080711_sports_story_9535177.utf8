The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods to be billion-dollar man by 2010
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Woods to be billion-dollar man by 2010
                      
	New York: Tiger Woods is on pace to pass one billion dollars in career earning by 2010, becoming the worlds first billionaire to accumulate his fortune by playing sports, says Forbes magazine.         
	The 14-time major championship winner earned 115 million dollars in 2007 alone, said the American magazine, which annually ranks the worlds richest people with its Forbes celebrity 100 list.         
	English footballer David Beckham was the No. 2 sportsman on the list with earnings of 65 million dollars.         
	There are plenty of billionaires who have excelled in sports like Switzerlands richest man and champion sailor Ernesto Bertarelli. But there are no billionaires who accumulated their fortune by playing sports.         
	The magazine also says that while tycoons like Bill Gates accumulated his wealth by holding a stake in a company with soaring profits, Woods is unique because his massive fortune was earned through pay cheques.

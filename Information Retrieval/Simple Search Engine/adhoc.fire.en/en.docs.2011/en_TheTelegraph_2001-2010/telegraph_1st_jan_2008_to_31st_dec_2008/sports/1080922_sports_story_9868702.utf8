The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji a threat, says Hayden
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bhajji a threat, says Hayden

	Melbourne: Matthew Hayden may not be among the big admirers of Harbhajan Singh but the Australian opener has no qualms in admitting that the feisty Indian off-spinner would pose the main threat to his side during their four-match Test series.         
	Hayden had famously called Harbhajan obnoxious weed during Indias controversy-ridden tour Down Under early this year. Hayden said he was all geared up to renew the on-field rivalry with Harbhajan on slow Indian pitches.         
	Having played ove there and played well over there, I think Im going to be the obvious target, Hayden said before leaving for India.         
	Harbhajan is very competitive, especially in his own environment. Hes a big threat to our side. Hes skilful and has got some weapons in conditions that will favour him.         
	My job will be to combat that so for me its a battle Im really looking forward to, Hayden said.         
	To be part of the number one cricket side in the world is always a big challenge. I expect no mercy from the Indians but thats why Ill enjoy this series. Ill be right in the thick of it, added Hayden who toured India in 2001.         
	The Queenslander spanked 549 runs at 109.80 on that tour and his record against India is imposing, 1654 runs at 66.16 with six centuries.         
	In the same series, Harbhajan took 32 wickets in a gripping contest that India won 2-1.         
	I think this series is tailor-made for guys like me, said Hayden, who will turn 37 in India. (PTI)

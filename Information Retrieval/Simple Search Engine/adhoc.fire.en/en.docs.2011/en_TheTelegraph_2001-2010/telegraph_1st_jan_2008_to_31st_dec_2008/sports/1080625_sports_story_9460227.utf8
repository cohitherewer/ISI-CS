The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni looks to emulate Kapils feat at Lords
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dhoni looks to emulate Kapils feat at Lords
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jhulan Goswami feels its a dream to play at Lords                           
	Calcutta: Some of the worlds top players have given their support to the ICC World Twenty20 event which will take place in England next year.         
	On the day details of ticket availability were announced, England captain Paul Collingwood said he was already looking forward to what should be a thrilling tournament, according to an ICC release.         
	Its going to be great, said Collingwood. Already Twenty20 cricket is massive. Its great to play in and from a players point of view it is obviously a shortened form of the game but it is very intense and every single ball matters.         
	Collingwoods hard-hitting teammate Kevin Pietersen added: I think what its going to do is capture the world. I know it has captured a lot of the world now and I think that it is a game that can go to America. Its exciting to be playing cricket right now.         
	India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni was equally positive about the event, not surprising perhaps, considering he was the one who lifted the trophy in the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa last year.         
	For us, of course, last year was a memorable tournament and it was a great feeling to lift that trophy. We had gone into it as underdogs  no one really expected us to win it as we had played only one Twenty20 International before. It was a great tournament and a sweet moment when we won. It is one of the things I will cherish for the rest of my life.         
	How would it feel to become the first India captain since Kapil Dev in 1983 to lift a world trophy at a final in Lords?         
	Of course I would love to do that but its the team that makes a good captain and I like to distribute the pressure and responsibility around the whole team. It would be a dream to lift the trophy at Lords but I dont want to look that far ahead and if it does happen, it would be an all-round team effort.         
	Naturally enough, England womens captain Charlotte Edwards agrees. She, too, is looking forward to next years ICC World Twenty20.         
	As a team we have the World Cup, World Twenty20 and Ashes in a six-month period and it is a great opportunity to raise awareness of the team, said Edwards.         
	It would be a fairytale if we were to get to the final along with the England mens team, especially if both matches were against Australia . Playing in a world final at Lords in front of 30,000 people would be the highlight of anybodys career.         
	Another player excited about the tournament is India fast bowler Jhulan Goswami. Its a dream to play at Lords as it is a special place for each and every cricketer. I have played an ODI there before and would love to play there again, she said.         
	It would be fantastic to be in the final at Lords, especially because of what happened in 1983.         
	Indian cricket changed because of that and more people became interested. If we win the World Twenty20, it could have a similar effect for womens cricket not just in India but across Asia, she said.         
	We might not be able to hit six sixes in an over but women do play good quality cricket. quot;New Zealand captain Haidee Tiffin is also looking forward to competing and, perhaps, making it to Lords for the final.         
	It would be a dream, said Tiffin. Ive played for New Zealand for 10 years and it would be fantastic to play not only at Lords, but to have the opportunity to play at The Oval and Trent Bridge as well is really exciting, she said. The squad will work really hard to play at Lords. Its a dream.

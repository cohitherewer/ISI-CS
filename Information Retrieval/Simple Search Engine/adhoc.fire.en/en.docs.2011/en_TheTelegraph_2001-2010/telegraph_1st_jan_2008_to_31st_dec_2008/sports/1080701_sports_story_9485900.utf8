	Madrid: A 40-year-old man was found dead in Madrid after the late night celebrations that followed Spains European Championship victory, media reports said on Monday.         
	The body of the man, wearing a red Spain jersey, was found at the centre of the Spanish capital with head injuries apparently sustained from a fall, reports said.         
	Euphoric Spaniards poured into the streets to celebrate their European Championship victory over Germany.         
	Elated fans draped in red and yellow Spanish flags thronged the streets in the hot summer evening, cheering and shouting Viva Espana as the fiesta began.         
	I couldnt watch. I cant believe it. They really deserve it, said 38-year-teacher Eva Lumbreras, coming out of her house in a Madrid suburb to join other revellers outside as fireworks lit up the sky.         
	Cars and motorcycles gridlocked roads, blaring their horns and waving flags. Thousands with their faces painted yellow and red cried and hugged each other in Plaza Colon, the central Madrid square where the match had been aired on a giant screen.

                                                Dont play with Dravids career: Kiri
                      
	Jamshedpur: Former wicketkeeper Syed Kirmani on Wednesday lashed out at the Indian team management in Australia for playing with the career of Rahul Dravid by pushing him to the openers slot.         
	Kirmani felt Dravid had established himself as a dependable No. 3 in the batting order and the team managements decision to send him as opener was not justified.         
	Dravid has been consistently performing at No. 3 slot and he should have continued at it. It was not a right decision particularly when specialist opener (Virender) Sehwag was in the squad, he said.         
	He said he had been taken aback by Sehwags exclusion from the XI despite the right-hander having an impressive record in Australia.         
	Kirmani said he did not see any reason for having two spinners in the playing XI on bouncy Australian pitches.         
	Questioning the commitment of current players, Kirmani said: During our time, we used to play for the country and its pride. But, now people are more inclined towards the game because of the money and glamour it involved.

	Melbourne: Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin and Indian fast bowler Zaheer Khans heated exchange during the first Test had the potential of snowballing into a major crisis but Match Referee Chris Broad has played down the incident, saying it was just a chat.         
	Its a Test match involving Australia, isnt it, Broad was quoted as saying in a local daily. Theres always a bit of chat. Nothing was reported to me.         
	Zaheer and Haddin got involved in an animated exchange before a break on the third day of the drawn first Test. (PTI)

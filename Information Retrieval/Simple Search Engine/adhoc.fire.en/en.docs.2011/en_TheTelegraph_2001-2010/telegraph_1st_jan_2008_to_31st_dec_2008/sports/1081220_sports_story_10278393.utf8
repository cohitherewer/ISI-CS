The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No fill in yet for Pak tour
                                                                                                                                                                                                     No fill in yet for Pak tour
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: The scrapping of the tour of Pakistan has created a void in Indias cricket calendar and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will find it difficult to squeeze in an alternative series because of the prior commitments of the other teams.         
	BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan said the board was yet to take a decision on whether to fit in any fresh series to fill the gap.         
	We have not decided anything but the board will look into it, Srinivasan said.         
	India are currently hosting England and will tour New Zealand in March-April. Back-to-back series against either of these two countries can be ruled out.         
	Sri Lanka have in principle agreed to tour Pakistan after India called off their visit following the terror attacks in Mumbai.         
	Australia, on the other hand, are already hosting South Africa, who would reciprocate and host Ricky Pontings men for a full series featuring three Tests, five ODIs and two Twenty20 internationals from February to April.         
	Besides, England are scheduled to tour the Caribbean from January 25 to April 3, which means the West Indies will also be in no position to entertain Indias request.         
	And with Zimbabwe set to tour Bangladesh in January, even the minnows will be hard-pressed for time.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia and coach Bob Houghton on Wednesday said it would be wrong to magnify Indias defeat against Maldives in the SAFF Cup final.         
	Time has come to change our mindset, Bhutia said on the first day of the national camp here.         
	We played well throughout the tournament and lost a match which we should have won. It was unfortunate that we had to lose the all-important tie by a last minute goal, he said.         
	Houghton said in the last one year, India have played 18 matches and have lost only three. Thats a fairly good record I believe, he commented. Meanwhile, out of the 31 players in the camp, only 21 could practise on Wednesday as the rest were either down with fever or injury.         
	Houghton said he was not sure whether Steven Dias or Sandeep Nandy would be able to make the Portugal trip. Even Bhutia restricted himself to physical training because of a shoulder pain.         
	A total of 27 players will go to Portugal on July 2 or 3 to play three practice matches. The camp will resume on July 16 and India will play a practice match against Malaysia in Hyderabad on July 22.

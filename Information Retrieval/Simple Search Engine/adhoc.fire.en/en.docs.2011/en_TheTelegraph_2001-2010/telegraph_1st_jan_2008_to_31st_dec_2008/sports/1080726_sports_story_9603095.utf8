The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shabbir Ali slams IFA
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shabbir Ali slams IFA
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Dejected Mohammedan Sporting fans left the Barasat stadium blaming the referee for forcing their team to play on a pitch that they termed unplayable.         
	Coach Shabbir Ali, while praising the George players for their creativity and energy, also slammed IFA officials for scheduling their match at Barasat.         
	He said: While Mohun Bagan get to practice at the Salt Lake Stadium, we were forced to play a competitive match on a surface that was clearly unfit.         
	Ali quipped that it was merely an off day for his team and they would bounce back in the next match, provided IFA stops their step-motherly treatment.         
	Suva Kumar, Man-of-the-Match on Friday, was delighted with his display and said it was his best performance.         
	Asked about his role within the George Telegraph side, Kumar said: I am primarily a play maker or an attacking midfielder, but I am ready to do anything for the team, even defending.

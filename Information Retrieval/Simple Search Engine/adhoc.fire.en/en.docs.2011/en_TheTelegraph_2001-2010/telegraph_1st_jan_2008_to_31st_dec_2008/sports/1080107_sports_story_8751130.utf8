                                                   Rafa was very tired: Youzhny

      OUR CORRESPONDENT
           
	Chennai: In his previous nine attempts, Mikhail Youzhny had beaten Rafael Nadal only three times and  no points for guessing  never in straight sets. 
    
	To come out 6-0, 6-1 winner, and that too in the final of an ATP event, is something the Russian had not thought of even in his wildest dream before Sunday. 
    
	I think Saturdays was the final, Youzhny said after winning the Chennai Open on Sunday. Rafa was very tired He couldnt move He couldnt play the world No.19 said. 
    
	The Russian had thought, like just about everybody else, that the world No.2 wont give up even after being whitewashed 0-6 in the first set and would stage a comeback. 
    
	To be honest, I thought he may come back in the second set. Then I realised that he was not being able to move well. 
    
	I decided to keep the ball in play and reduce my mistakes because he was making too many of them, said the Russian in frank admission. 
    
	The fourth seed felt it was very tough for Nadal. To play the final after such an emotional semi-final match It is no doubt very tough. Youzhny, who is yet to win a Grand Slam, will now go all out for the Australian Open. I am very happy with the way I am playing right now, said the Russian who he had emerged the winner from a very tough three-setter in the first round. 
    
	I built my game gradually and played my best tennis in the final. 
    
	For his part, Nadal swaggered in to the media centre savouring an ice-cream and denied any injuries. 
    
	No No injuries I am just too tired after playing that match. Thats all. 
    
	Nevertheless, it has been a good season opener for me and I hope to carry on my good form in the Australian Open, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaibs claim upsets BCCI
                                                   Shoaibs claim upsets BCCI
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Upset with Shoaib Akhtars loose talk, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has formally asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to look into the speedsters claim of having been approached by bookies in India.         
	Ive sent letters to the ICC president (Ray Mali) and the chief executive (Malcolm Speed), saying its a serious matter which needs to be looked into thoroughly, secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph.         
	The letters were sent on Thursday, the day the BCCI-promoted Indian Premier League barred Shoaib from playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders till his five-year ban got revoked.         
	Cricket South Africas stand couldnt be confirmed, for Shoaib claimed hed also been approached to under-perform in South Africa, but the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit will soon be having at least a word with him.         
	Potentially, Shoaib has violated the Code of Conduct, but we first need to ascertain all the facts, pointed out ICC spokesman Brian Murgatroyd.         
	Speaking from Dubai, on Friday evening, he added: Of course, its not necessary for our officers to travel to Pakistan, the facts could be got over the phone...         
	On the face of it, then, Shoaib has again shot himself in the foot.

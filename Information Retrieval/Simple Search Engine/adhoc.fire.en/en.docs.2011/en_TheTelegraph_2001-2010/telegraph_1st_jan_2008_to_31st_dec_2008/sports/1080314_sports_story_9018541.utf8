	Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs Afforce heads the scales at 60kg in the seven-horse field lined up for the 1,200m Elusive Pimpernel Cup, the main attraction in Saturdays eight-event card. There are four trophy events on the day, also including the Grand Annual Handicap, which has lost much of its charm since the advent of the Million races. As a result of this, only three horses will contest the race. However, all of them are sporting different colours, giving a competitive touch to the event. The first race starts at 12.40pm.ACCEPTANCES

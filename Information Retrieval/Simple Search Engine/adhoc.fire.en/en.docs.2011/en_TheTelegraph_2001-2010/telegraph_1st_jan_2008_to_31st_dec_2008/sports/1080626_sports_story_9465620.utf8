The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arshavin chases Barcelona dream
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Arshavin chases Barcelona dream
    - Russian star eager to join Spanish giants                   Andrei Arshavin                      
	Vienna: Russias attacking midfielder Andrei Arshavin says moving to FC Barcelona would be a dream come true. The Zenit St. Petersburg player has been one of the stars of the European Championship despite only playing two games because of suspension.         
	His dribbling and passing skills, plus two goals in as many matches, have fuelled speculation he will play in one of Europes biggest leagues next season. I have supported Barcelona all my life. Barcelona are my dream, Arshavin told the official website of Euro 2008. I never thought I would have a genuine chance to play for the club. Lets see how the situation unfolds.         
	Arshavin was in Vienna on Wednesday to prepare for Thursdays semi-final clash with Spain, and said he was focusing solely on that match. For now, I cant say anything for sure, he said. At the moment Im a player of team Russia and Im only thinking about doing well in the semi-finals.         
	Arshavin showed off his skills in Europe even before Euro 2008. He was instrumental in Zenits victorious Uefa Cup campaign this season and set up both goals in the 2-0 defeat of Glasgow Rangers in the final. His performances for Russia since returning from a two-match suspension have lit up the European Championship. He starred in Russias 2-0 defeat of Sweden that put the team in the quarterfinal and then scored and set up a goal in the 3-1 demolition of favourites Holland in Basel.         
	I came here hoping Id get a chance to play at such a big tournament. Ive never been to an event like this before, he said. We had some very tough training sessions and it was difficult for me to be training a lot knowing I wouldnt be playing.         
	It was an unusual feeling. Even so Im happy Guus Hiddink brought me here despite the ban and let me become a part of the tournament.         
	Arshavin says Russia will have to be far tighter in the semi-final than they were against Spain in the teams Group D opener, which Spain won 4-1, with David Villa grabbing a hat trick.         
	We committed tactical and individual mistakes. If you give a shadow of a chance to a striker like David Villa or Fernando Torres, they will get you in trouble, said the 27-year-old, who has 13 goals in 36 international appearances. These guys can easily beat a defender one-on-one then score. Thats exactly what they did.         
	But even if they play more tightly, Russia are not planning to rein in the attacking style that has won they so many fans in Austria and Switzerland. Russia will play their normal way. We dont play defensive football, we like to attack, Arshavin said.         
	But it doesnt all depend on us. Lets see how the Spaniards do. Maybe it makes it harder for us that we play such an open kind of football, because our opponent knows how to counter attack and they have some fast players. But we need to play our way instead of adapting to the opposition. (AP)

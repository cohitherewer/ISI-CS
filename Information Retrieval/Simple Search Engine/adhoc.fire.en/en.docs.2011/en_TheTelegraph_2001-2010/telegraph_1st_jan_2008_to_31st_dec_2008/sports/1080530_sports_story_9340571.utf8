	Paris: Reputations counted for little at the French Open on Thursday when Amelie Mauresmo, James Blake and David Nalbandian were toppled by opponents ranked outside the worlds top 75.         
	Triple champion Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Venus Williams and Jelena Jankovic survived the carnage and dodged the rain, which once again returned to Roland Garros, to stride on.         
	Mauresmos slim hopes of winning her home Grand Slam were shredded in the second round by a 19-year-old upstart ranked 132 in the world, Carla Suarez Navarro.         
	Before arriving in Paris, Carla had never played at a Grand Slam. That did not stop the Spanish qualifier from embarrassing the 22nd seed Mauresmo with a 6-3, 6-4 victory. Seventh-seeded Blake, one of the five American men to reach the second round, had been hoping to join compatriot Wayne Odesnik in the last 32 but was bounced out by an rival who hails from a family of basketball players.         
	Latvian teenager Ernests Gulbis, ranked 80th in the world, ensured Blakes nightmare in Paris continued with a 7-6,3-6,7-5,6-3 humbling on Court One. The American has never passed the third round in six attempts.         
	Unlike Mauresmo and Blake, sixth seed Nalbandian had enjoyed a good track record at the clay court major after reaching the semi-finals in 2004 and 2006, but he resigned a two-set lead to go down 3-6,4-6,6-2,6-1,6-2 to French wildcard Jeremy Chardy.         
	For a woman who had never before experienced the imposing surroundings of the Philippe Chatrier Court, Carla remained undaunted and turned into public enemy No. 1 as she handed Mauresmo her earliest defeat at her home Grand Slam for seven years.         
	The teenager ended Mauresmos ordeal after 72 minutes of one-sided action, the Frenchwoman punching a backhand long on match point.         
	Former champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario was among the Spaniards entourage which applauded her moment of triumph as a crestfallen Mauresmo was left to digest her 14th flop in Paris. Frankly, I dont know what to say right now, because there was nothing much on my side, said a demoralised Mauresmo, who has never progressed beyond the last eight in Paris. All I can say is that I feel sorry about the way I played.         
	Nalbandian would also be kicking himself after allowing a winning situation to slip through his fingers. The local favourite remained unfazed even when he was cramping and 0-2 down in the fifth set. He pulled off the biggest victory of his career when Nalbandian scooped a backhand into the net after three hours of see-saw action. As Nalbandian tried to work out what to do with the free time that had unexpectedly come his way, Blake was simply disgusted by his performance. I lost to a guy ranked 80th in the world. Granted, he didnt play like 80th in the world, he played better than that. But there are a lot of guys out there that can dictate play against me if I try to play like that, Blake fumed.         
	Albert Montanes had the audacity to take the first set off Federer but it did not take the world No.1 long to pull rank. Firing winners at ease, he put the Spanish minion firmly in his place with a 6-7 6-1 6-0 6-4 exhibition.After being given the run around by the rain for three days, Nadal wasted little time in stifling French qualifier Nicolas Devilder 6-4 6-0 6-1.         
	On Thursday, it took him less than two hours to book his third round berth against fellow left-hander Jarkko Nieminen.         
	Williams was a 6-2, 6-4 winner over Tunisian qualifier, Selima Sfar while Jankovic overcame a wrist injury scare to see off New Zealands Marina Erakovic 6-2,7-6. (Reuters)

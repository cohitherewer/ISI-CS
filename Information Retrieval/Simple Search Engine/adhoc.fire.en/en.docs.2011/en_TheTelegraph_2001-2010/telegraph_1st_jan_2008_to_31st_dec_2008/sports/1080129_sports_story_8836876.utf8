The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IOA rejects revised sports policy
                                                IOA rejects revised sports policy
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       
	New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on Monday rejected the revised form of the proposed sports policy and said the attitude of the government could cost India the Commonwealth Games.         
	After a three-hour meeting between officials of the Sports Ministry, the IOA office bearers and 40 sports federations, Suresh Kalmadi, the IOA president said the deadlock could not be broken.         
	The absence of sports minister for such an important meeting is disappointing, said Kalmadi.         
	Equally disappointing is the revised sports policy. We have made our points. We hope they come back with fresh and acceptable proposals.         
	According to the IOA chief the federations are upset that the government is still persisting with the proposed formation of a sports regulatory body to gain control over the functioning of the federations.         
	The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is extremely upset with the attitude of the Indian government and we could lose the Commonwealth Games, Kalmadi said.         
	They wont like any violation of the Olympic charter, he3 added.         
	The IOA and the sports federations are especially peeved with the ministry for holding back funds for preparations of Beijing Games.         
	If our sportspersons do badly in Beijing, the Government will remain responsible for it. Even our shooters are not receiving ammunitions for practice, Kalmadi said.

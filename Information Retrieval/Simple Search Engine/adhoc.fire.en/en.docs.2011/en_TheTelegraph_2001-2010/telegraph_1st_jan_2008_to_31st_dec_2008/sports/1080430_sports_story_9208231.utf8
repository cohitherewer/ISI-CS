            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: State leagues in India received yet another body blow on Tuesday when the AIFF reduced the quota of foreigners in the local championships.         
	While three foreigners would be allowed to play in the I-League, the clubs wont be able to use more than two foreigners in the local leagues. The decision was taken by the AIFF executive committee here.         
	The federation has also imposed a levy of Rs 1 lakh on Bengal Peerless for organising the Bayern Munich versus Mohun Bagan match on May 27.         
	The AIFF has also decided to constitute a committee that will inspect the Mohun Bagan ground before granting the club the permission to host the I-League matches.         
	The I-League for the 2008-09 season should be a 12-team affair and two more teams will be added next season.         
	The federation, meanwhile, will provide financial assistance to the families of late D. Kannan and V.P. Sathyan.

	John has informed me that he will not be looking to extend his contract for another term and will instead pursue other coaching opportunities in cricket, New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said. Bracewell, a former off-spinner who took 102 wickets in 41 Tests for New Zealand, has previously said he is interested in returning to coaching English County cricket.         
	I have enjoyed my time with the Black Caps and am now looking forward to future challenges at the conclusion of my contract next year, Bracewell said. The 50-year-old, currently in England with the touring New Zealand team, coached Gloucestershire for five years before taking up the top New Zealand post in 2003.

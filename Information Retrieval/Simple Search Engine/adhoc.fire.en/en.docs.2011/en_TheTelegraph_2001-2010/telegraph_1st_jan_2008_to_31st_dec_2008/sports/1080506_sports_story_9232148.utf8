The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tribunal to keep a tab on pacer 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tribunal to keep a tab on pacer 
                      
	Karachi: Shoaib Akhtars five-year ban may have been suspended for one month to allow him to play in the IPL, but PCB-appointed appellate tribunal chairman on Monday said he would monitor what the fast bowler says in India while playing in the Twenty20 tournament.         
	Justice (retd) Aftab Farrukh said the tribunal would not spy on the controversial fast bowler but would monitor whatever he utters in India.         
	I would monitor anything that is from his mouth which is recorded, not only the fresh news but whatever ... If it is brought to our notice then we will certainly look right or left for that, he said.         
	We would like him to play his game but if anyone brings it to our notice, certainly I will take what comes from his mouth in a recorded manner, not what a newspaper writes or so. I dont expect that he would do this now; I think he has learned his lesson, Farrukh said.         
	The former judge of Lahore high court also believed the rapprochement between Shoaib and PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf was a good omen. That matter has been settled out of court and I think the formality of breaking the ice between Shoaib and Ashraf has happened.         
	The PCB chief Monday dropped his defamation suit against Shoaib .         
	Farrukh said the defamation suit had nothing to do with the tribunal proceedings and Shoaib will face the appeal when he returns from India and the case will be decided on merit.         
	We will start the remaining proceedings of the appeal on merit. Whatever he has done in the form of public apology to the board will not wash off his conviction. That will help in mitigating the offence, it will certainly help effect the quantum of sentence, he said.         
	Meanwhile, former pacer Sarfraz Nawaz said: I am happy he has had his ban suspended and this allows him to play in the IPL. But I know how difficult it is getting back into rhythm and match form if you havent played for six months.

	Thierry Henry is among the hazards that could derail the Premier Leagues Big Four as they hope for a favourable outcome in next weeks draw for the crucial knockout stages.         
	Heres weighing up their chances:               
	Arsenal         
	The kings of inconsistency, Arsenal continue to frustrate: work of art one minute, work in progress the next.         
	Opponents have become wise to Arsene Wengers men, even those European style masters who traditionally rely on silk rather than steel. Teams close down Arsenal quickly, denying them the space required to fashion moves. The recent criticism of lacking leaders continues to ring true. Even the wonderful Fabregas, who has been thrown the arm-band in the wake of William Gallass meltdown, is not a real leader.         
	If Wenger can keep control of the incipient tensions in the dressing-room and guide Arsenal to the final in Rome, it will arguably be his greatest achievement.         
	Chelsea         
	Luiz Felipe Scolari has a liking for knockout competitions. Despite recent criticism, Scolari has a long-established reputation of being able to influence games. Talk now bubbles forth of Chelsea playing with Nicolas Anelka alongside Drogba atop a diamond midfield, yet Drogba often works best in a 4-3-3, as a target-man feeding off good wide service.         
	John Obi Mikel has been one of the midfielders of the season, Frank Lampard is back to his best, Deco and Joe Cole can unlock defences while Michael Essien will return in the new year. Ricardo Carvalhos restoration would shore up the defence.         
	Liverpool         
	Benitez possesses an uncanny ability to set his team up right for Champions League challenges.         
	The potential availability of Wigans Emile Heskey has been discussed at Anfield, while Benitez could tell Ryan Babel to cover for Torres.         
	On the left, the talented Albert Riera needs to hurt defences more. Liverpools strength, though, is not out wide, particularly with a collection of average full-backs. Their strength lies through the middle and their captain and inspiration, Steven Gerrard, will always create and score.         
	Manchester United         
	Ferguson also has some significant personnel decisions to make. In goal, Ben Foster must be given a chance to prove he can be the successor to Edwin van der Sar, although the Dutchman remains the more reliable option for now.         
	Anderson and Michael Carrick have been terrific this season, blending dynamism, tackling and passing but Paul Scholes has made a welcome return from injury.         
	In attack, Ferguson appears, quite rightly, to be committed to Wayne Rooney playing off Dimitar Berbatov. Carlos Tevez is earmarked for the late-show man.         
	Out wide, Cristiano Ronaldo needs to raise his game even higher if he is to retain his Ballon dOr next year as Lionel Messi garners rave reviews at Barcelona.

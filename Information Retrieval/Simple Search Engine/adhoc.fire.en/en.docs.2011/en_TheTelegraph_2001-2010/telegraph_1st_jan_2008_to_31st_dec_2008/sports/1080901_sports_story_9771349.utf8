The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Henriques to replace Symonds
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Henriques to replace Symonds
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: New South Wales batsman Moises Henriques will join the Australia team as allrounder Andrew Symondss replacement for the remaining matches of the Commonwealth Bank Series in Darwin.         
	Symonds was sent back home after he missed a compulsory team meeting and went on a fishing trip.         
	This selection was complicated by the Australia A team being in India. In normal circumstances, the additional player added to the Australia squad would come from those selected for Australia A. With only two ODIs remaining in Darwin and 12 fit players however, its unlikely that any replacement player would play in either of these matches, national selection panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said in a statement.         
	Given the importance of the Australia A tour of India... It was decided that a young emerging player should be added to the national team to gain experience, Hilditch said.         
	The national selection panel thought it was an ideal opportunity to reward Moises for an outstanding stint at the Cricket Australia centre of excellence and Emerging Players Tournament.

                                                                                                                                                                                           Chelsea to probe
Manchester Uniteds team bus damaged            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                
	Chelsea have launched an official investigation after Manchester Uniteds team bus was damaged on its way from Stamford Bridge. The coachs front windscreen was cracked after a bottle was thrown at it following the 1-1 draw.         
	We are aware of reports of an altercation with the Manchester United bus as it left the Stamford Bridge area, a Chelsea statement said.         
	It appears to be an isolated incident but we have launched a full investigation in conjunction with local authorities.         
	We do not condone violence in any shape or form. If, as a result of our investigations, we find that any Chelsea supporters were involved we will take appropriate action against those individuals.         
	A United spokesman confirmed an official report had been registered with the police. It is the second time inside five months that Uniteds visit to Chelsea has ended in controversy.         
	Last season, Rio Ferdinand had to apologise to a female steward after angrily kicking a ball at her while Patrice Evra became involved in a furious row with the Chelsea groundsman, which is still being investigated by the Football Association.         
	United could face action from the FA after seven players were cautioned by referee Mike Riley. Ferdinand stormed angrily from the pitch following a late collision with Didier Drogba, and Gary Neville had to be shepherded away from Riley by Sir Alex Ferguson.         
	Sundays result left Chelsea second in the table, a point behind leaders and London rivals Arsenal, with United seven points off top spot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangladesh fail to put   up a fight
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bangladesh fail to put   up a fight
                            
	Sydney: Australia crushed Bangladesh by eight wickets in the second one-day International at Darwin on Wednesday to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in their three-game series.         
	The Australians showed no mercy as they coasted to victory with more than 27 overs to spare after bowling the visitors out for just 117, and then racing to 118 for two in reply.         
	Shaun Marsh top-scored with an unbeaten 69 while Shane Watson made 29 as the world champions followed up their 180-run win on Saturday with another lopsided victory.         
	Mitchell Johnson was the pick of the Australian bowlers capturing three for 17.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Good job but we need to be realistic
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Good job but we need to be realistic
                    GUEST COLUMN    Geoffrey Boycott          
	Lets congratulate England on an excellent performance. They eased past New Zealand in three days at Trent Bridge, and that is exactly the result we have been asking for. The Black Caps may be a desperately weak side, but you cant do any more than beat what is put in front of you.         
	At the same time, though, there needs to be some realism. If New Zealand had found a way to dismiss Andrew Strauss at Old Trafford, they would have been 1-0 up coming into the Nottingham match. And then it all might have turned out quite differently. Better teams will not let England off the hook so easily.         
	As good professionals, the players should always be looking to improve  especially if they are going to beat the Aussies next summer. So here are some constructive comments on the individual performances so far this season.         
	Michael Vaughan: Vaughan is a guy with so much talent that you sometimes wonder whether he has too many shots for his own good. His batting is always easy on the eye, and his cover drive is to die for. But there are weaknesses to work on. His defence is not tight enough, his concentration wanders and his shot selection gets him into trouble. He ought to be a superstar. But in the last four years he has averaged just 30 for Yorkshire. He seems to be able to get up for the big occasion, but he has a problem with consistency.         
	Alastair Cook: Ive always been a big fan. Hes a good, young player who will continue to do well in Tests. I think he plays too much in front of his pad  a weakness that the New Zealanders have exploited well. Maybe it is the impatience of youth, but he needs to learn to let the ball come to him, not push at it.         
	Andrew Strauss: The boy was brilliant. After the nightmare of last year, to make the century he did under pressure at Old Trafford was a terrific achievement. He has got this new way of playing, which allows him to judge his off-stump better. I still think he is too upright  we old pros like to see a bigger stride, and a big knee-bend too.         
	Kevin Pietersen: A class act. Enough said.         
	Paul Collingwood: Collingwood has played magnificently for a couple of years. But, like Bell, he has got into a form rut that he will have to address during the one-day series. Any technical deficiencies always come to the fore when you are struggling, and Collingwoods flaws are all too obvious. His left foot doesnt go close enough to the pitch of the ball, and his right hand comes into the stroke too much. But he is a scrapper: once he spends time in the middle and gets his confidence back I dont think hell have a problem.         
	Ryan Sidebottom: I dont think any of us can understand why, after his brilliant series in New Zealand, Sidebottom has been bowling so short and wide. He only found his rhythm on the last morning, when he finally managed to pitch the ball up; the result was that he took six wickets. Sidebottom will always give you 100 per cent effort. He is a great professional, like his dad. But if he pitches short and doesnt get swing, hes only half the bowler.         
	James Anderson: Mercurial. Anderson has a gift from the gods: he could swing an orange. He is either sublime or exasperating. Could you believe some of those balls he bowled in the first innings, swinging away late and uprooting the off-stump? And then the next morning, when he had a chance to get all 10, he couldnt bowl one straight. I dont believe theres going to be much improvement on that. Anderson will always have plenty of energy and spirit and youthful exuberance, but his captain will also have a frustrating time with him. We just have to accept him for what he is.

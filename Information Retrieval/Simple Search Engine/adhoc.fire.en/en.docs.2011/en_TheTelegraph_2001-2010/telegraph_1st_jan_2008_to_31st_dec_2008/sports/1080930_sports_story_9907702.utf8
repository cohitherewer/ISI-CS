    - I-League City giants share points with Air India; East Bengal take on Mumbai FC today             A STAFF REPORTER            Mohammedan Sportings Theodore Sunday (left) vies for the ball with an Air India player at the Barasat stadium on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Air India, who have a history of playing with determination and stealing points from teams superior to them, did an encore on Monday, holding Mohammedan Sporting 1-1 at the Barasat stadium.         
	The result means, among the four city-based teams, only East Bengal have won their first match in the second edition of the I-League.         
	Mohammedan Sporting started with the tried and tested duo of Theodore Sunday and Mike Okoro upfront, though Sunday wasnt 100 per cent. Adewusi Adebayo, who didnt feature in the black and white brigades CFL campaign, was introduced in the midfield.         
	Air India coach Bimal Ghosh started with Emmanuel Ovieghara, the lanky Nigerian, alongside Samson Singh upfront. After a cagey opening 10 minutes, the Mohammedan Sporting defence sans Sheikh Azim was tested in the 13th minute. Uttam Singhs powerful throw from the left sideline sailed over the defence, finding Emmanuels head. The strikers effort was goal-bound, but Naseem Akhtar reached the far post just in time to make the save.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, though, responded immediately with an effort from Sunday that was smartly kept out by Air India custodian Arup Debnath. Sunday and Okoro were tied down by Air India thereafter, resulting in the strikers being starved of chances.         
	In the 22nd minute, the shaky Mohammedan Sporting defence was breached. The move started with Tayo bombing forward from his position in the midfield, till he was brought down by a struggling Bijoy at the edge of the box. The Goan referee played advantage and Emmanuels cross from the right was slotted in smartly by Surojit Roy.         
	Shabbir Alis boys failed to turn the screws as Air Indias vigil on Sunday and Okoro grew tighter. Adebayo and Sovan Chakraborty lacked inventiveness, while Jyothi Kumar was wasteful.         
	Sunday, frustrated at being allowed no room, fell back and started a beautiful move towards the end of the first period. The Liberian cleverly released Jyothi at the edge of the box, who then chose to pick Okoro to his left. Okoros dainty chip off the outside of his right foot was meant for Sunday, but the local leagues top-scorer lost his footing when it mattered most.         
	Shabbir Alis half-time team talk surely added some zing to his sides performance, for they came out in the second period charging for every loose ball..         
	The equaliser finally came from his boots in the 59th minute from a Jyothi Kumar free-kick. Jyothi was brought down some 35 yards from the goal. The winger placed the resultant free-kick perfectly  Sunday brought it down with his chest and then sent it in with his left foot.         
	Without being overtly adventurous, both teams attempted to grab the winner but the openings were few and far between.

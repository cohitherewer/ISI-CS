            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT      
	Trainer S. Ganapathys Sweeping Success, who narrowly lost the Indian Derby, in Mumbai a month ago, struck it rich on Sunday in the Indian Turf Invitation Cup at the Malakpet racecourse in Hyderabad. It was, however, a close affair for the winner who was taken to the wire by the city challenger, Regal Connection, a Vijay Singh-trained horse. The Connection graced the wrong end of the field till 450m from home before coming in with a spirited run to lose by a mere neck.          
	For Prakash, who had been going through a lean patch, it was a big moment. The jockey, however, had immense faith in the ability of the Placerville-Lady Moura daughter. He had insisted on riding the filly against all odds. The filly was also neglected in the betting while her stablemate, Bourbon King, got all the support. Incidentally, the King who was in striking position as the 10-horse field turned for home, broke down when jockey Colm Donoghue applied pressure.

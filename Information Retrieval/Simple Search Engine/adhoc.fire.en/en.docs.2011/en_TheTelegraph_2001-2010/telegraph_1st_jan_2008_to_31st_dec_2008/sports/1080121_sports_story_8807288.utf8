                                                   Bhupathi, Sania advance; Paes out

           
	Melbourne: Sania Mirza kept her doubles campaign afloat but fifth seeds Leander Paes and Paul Hanley were sent packing by Rohan Bopanna and Rajeev Ram in the mens event at the Australian Open on Sunday. 
    
	Sania, whose singles campaign ended in the third round on Saturday, moved ahead in both the womens and mixed doubles. 
    
	Sania and her Australian partner Alicia Molik completed their rain-affected second-round match beating Russians Nadia Petrova and Elena Vesnina 6-3, 5-7, 6-4. 
    
	In mixed doubles, Sania and Mahesh Bhupathi ousted local favourites Molik and Nathan Healy 6-1, 6-4 in the first round. 
    
	Bopanna and American-Indian Ram shocked fifth seeds Paes and Hanley 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (6) in the second round. Bopanna and Ram will now take on South Africans Jeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie in the third round. 
    
	Bhupathi and Mark Knowles, seeded sixth, swept past Swiss Yves Allegro and Belgian Kristof Vliegen 6-1, 6-4 in the second round. 
    
	In the junior competition, eighth seed Yuki Bhambri defeated Italian Giorgio Portaluri 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 in first round of the boys singles and Karunuday Singh rallied to beat Italian Daniele Piludu 4-6, 6-0, 6-3. 
    
	However, things didnt go as well in the girls event and Janaki Gunuganti lost to fifth seed Serb Bojana Jovanovski 1-6, 3-6. (PTI)

                                                    Sehwag stakes claim for Test berth

	Sydney: Opener Virender Sehwag enhanced his claims for a recall to the Indian Test team on Saturday with a blazing 78-ball 113 against the ACT Invitational XI in Canberra. 
    
	Sehwag belted 18 boundaries and two sixes to almost certainly book a place in the starting side for next weeks third Test in Perth. 
    
	Sehwag smashed a century and Dinesh Karthik (97) came near one as Indias three-day practice match ended in a draw at the Manuka Oval. 
    
	In contrast, Yuvraj came a cropper again, managing just three in the second innings. 
    
	After India declared at the tea time score of 281 for four, the hosts, chasing an improbable target of 314 runs from 33 overs, were greeted by some early blows before they slumped to 60 for three at stumps. 
    
	The final 15 mandatory overs were not bowled as the Indians, presumably, wanted to be in time for the evening function at the Indian High Commissioners residence. 
    
	India had declared their first innings at 325 for nine, in reply to which the hosts had made 292 for eight before declaring their essay. 
    
	In contrast to the strong impression which Sehwag and Karthik created, Wasim Jaffer (21) and Yuvraj again disappointed in their second outing. 
    
	Jaffer fell to the leg-spinner Ryan Bulger while Yuvraj drove a low full toss from medium-pacer Adam Perera into the hands of short extra cover. 
    
	Sehwag had reprieves at 16 and 92 but it was a vintage stuff from the Delhi opener who peppered the offside region with brutal strokes in a knock of 113 off just 78 deliveries with 18 fours and two sixes in it.

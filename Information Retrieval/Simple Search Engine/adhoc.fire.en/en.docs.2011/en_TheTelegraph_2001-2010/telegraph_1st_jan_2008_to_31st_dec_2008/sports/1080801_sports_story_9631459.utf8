	Hicham El Guerrouj shed many tears during his glittering athletics career but finally righted the wrongs of two failed Olympic campaigns with a historic double at Athens 2004.         
	 For a while the slender, gracious Moroccan seemed destined to join the greats who for some reason were never to taste Olympic glory.. In 1996 at Atlanta the young pretender tumbled at the bell and picked himself up to finish down the field. From then on he dominated the 1500 metres.         
	However, he failed to take account of a relatively unsung Kenyan Noah Ngeny, who he had beaten on every occasion and who had paced him for his 1500m world record.         
	After a moderate season by his exalted standards in 2004 he approached the Athens Olympics in perhaps less confident frame of mind than before and added the 5000m to his agenda as a measure of insurance.         
	He finally fulfilled his destiny and ended any suggestions of mental fallibility by winning the 1500m title on a balmy night in the Greek capital.         
	Tears flooded down El Guerroujs face moments after he crossed the line but they were tears of joy and relief compared to the ones of frustration that welled up at after his two previous Olympics finals. Only victory can dry the tears of Atlanta and Sydney, El Guerrouj said.         
	Five days later he beat the peerless Kenenisa Bekele, who was already the 10,000m Olympic champion, and took the 5,000m title to become the first athlete since Pavel Nurmi in 1924 to land both events at the same Games.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray sets up Djokovic date
                                                                                                                                                                                             Murray sets up Djokovic date
                  Andy Murray in Monaco on Tuesday                     
	Monte Carlo: Britains Andy Murray beat Italian Filippo Volandri 6-4, 6-1 at the Monte Carlo Masters on Tuesday to line up a third-round match with Novak Djokovic.         
	Djokovic, the Australian Open champion, put in a solid performance to defeat Croatias Ivan Ljubicic 6-3, 6-3.         
	Murray broke to love in the sixth game of the first set, only for Volandri to break back in the seventh under threatening skies in the principality.         
	However, the Scot took the set after 44 minutes by breaking his opponents serve in the 10th game.         
	He was then simply too good for Volandri, who ran out of steam and lost his serve twice before bowing out with a wide forehand.         
	Ljubicic, who showed no mercy in knocking out Gustavo Kuerten on Monday, was helpless on centre court against Djokovic.         
	Former world No. 1 Marat Safin made light work of Belgian Xavier Malisse with a 6-3, 6-2 win in a first round match.         
	Meanwhile, Leander Paes and Paul Hanley advanced to the second round, following a straight sets win in their opening match.         
	The Indo-Australian pair defeated Argentine duo of David Nalbandian and Sebastian Prieto 6-4, 6-3. (AGENCIES)

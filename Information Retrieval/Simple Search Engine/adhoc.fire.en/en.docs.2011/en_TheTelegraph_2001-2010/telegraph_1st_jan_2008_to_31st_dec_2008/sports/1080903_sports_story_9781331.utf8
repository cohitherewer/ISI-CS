                                                                                                                                                                                                     United sign Berbatov
                      
	Paris: Ronaldinho, who left Barcelona for AC Milan, and Manchester City-bound Robinho were the two top names in football to have completed transfers during the summer.         
	Manchester Uniteds Cristiano Ronaldo and Andrei Arshavin of Zenit St Petersburg had been tipped for big-money moves but they came to nothing. Sir Alex Ferguson got his way however and hanging on to Ronaldo was the major task, as far as his squad was concerned, during the summer.         
	However, United beat the transfer deadline to complete a 37.7 million-euro deal for Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov. Berbatov, 27, agreed a four-year contract with United and Tottenham confirmed the deal on their website 45 minutes after the transfer window shut. Manchester City had tried to lure Berbatov to Eastlands after having an offer accepted for the Bulgarian, but he opted to join United following talks with Ferguson at the clubs Carrington training ground. City signed Robinho from Real Madrid for a fee of around 42 million euros, the English Premier League club confirmed on Tuesday.

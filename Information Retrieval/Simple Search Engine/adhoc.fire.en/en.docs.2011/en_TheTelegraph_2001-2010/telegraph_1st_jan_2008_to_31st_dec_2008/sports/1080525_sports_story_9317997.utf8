	Manchester: Ross Taylors unbeaten 154 placed New Zealand in firm control on the Day II of the second Test against England at Old Trafford on Saturday. England limped to 152 for four in reply to the Black Caps 381 after the injured Daniel Flynn did not return to bat.         
	England skipper, Michael Vaughan was lbw to an arm-ball by left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori, five overs before the close for 30, leaving Kevin Pietersen not out on 22 and Ian Bell on four.         
	Openers Alastair Cook (19) and Andrew Strauss (60) were also dismissed. Ryan Sidebottom was the last one out, three overs from the close and was caught at second slip off Vettori for four.         
	Flynn, hit in the mouth by an Anderson bouncer on Friday, went to hospital after the lunch break to visit a neurosurgeon. The team management wanted to rule out concussion, following complaints of nausea and vomiting. He was cleared and advised to rest.

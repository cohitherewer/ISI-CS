The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Im happy that my legacy continues: Steve Waugh
                                                Im happy that my legacy continues: Steve Waugh
  - If all goes well, Ill be in Calcutta later this year, says iconic former Aussie captain       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                          
	Sydney: The legendary Richie Benauds bronze sculpture was unveiled at the SCG on Friday, but the cynosure was the iconic Steve Waugh, who was present with wife Lynette.         
	Steves only other visit to the hallowed ground which oozes history so majestically, after his retirement in January 2004, was during last years Ashes Test.         
	Somehow I still feel nervous... Feel edgy when I come to the SCG, my home ground, he admitted.         
	Steve spoke to the media in general and, then, took time off to have a one-on-one with The Telegraph  his sole exclusive interaction of the day.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On whether he watched Benaud play         
	Not live, but Ive seen a lot of his footage... Very impressive stuff... The statue has captured the essence of Richie and what I particularly like is the collars up bit... He had flair, had individuality... Richie was one of the first with flair and individuality.         
	On returning to the SCG for only the second time since his retirement         
	Its always a great place to come back to, memories come flooding... Somehow I still feel nervous... Feel edgy when I come to the SCG, my home ground... I felt that way during 20 years of playing...         
	On the emotional send-off at the SCG four years ago         
	Yeah, it was a special day... That was a good series (against India) and I hope you enjoyed it as much as we players did.         
	On whether, at any time, he has missed cricket         
	(Laughs) No... Ive been playing enough backyard cricket with my son to keep me happy... The family is now my priority and Ive been doing other things... Business, charity...         
	On having said that cricketers live in a bubble         
	I did say that, but there are a lot of positive things too for the cricketers... Playing for their country... Earning a lot of money... Theres scrutiny, yes, but thats the price you pay for being professiona- and earning big.         
	On whether its painful that two former teammates of his, Shane Warne and Adam Gilchrist, engaged in a war through the media         
	Its not painful, but when you play together as a unit you learn to get along... You may not be the best mates but youve got to show each other respect... Shanes retired now and he has an opinion... People want opinions... Of course they would probably have been better off talking behind closed doors and not expressing their views in public. But, then, both are strong personalities and have strong opinions.         
	On Warnes criticism of some of the tactics during Team Indias last tour of Australia (2003-04), when he was captain         
	The strategy would be discussed in team meetings and Warne would be among the XII (players) present... With hindsight one can say a lot of things.         
	On Indias showing in the ongoing series         
	Its still early to judge... Today (Friday) is only the seventh morning of the series... Its a critical day for India, probably the most crucial of the series... If it doesnt go well and India lose the Test, then the series is effectively gone... Being an Australian, I dont want India to do too well!         
	[The Q amp;A session was held before Day III, which turned out to be terrific for India, got under way.]         
	On Anil Kumble getting the Test captaincy at 37         
	Dont see why he cant do a good job... Of the others, I think (V.V.S.) Laxman has a good cricket mind and probably (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni as well.         
	On having praised Sourav on the eve of the series         
	(Smiles) I meant exactly what I said  even if you dont like Sourav, youve got to respect and admire him... In fact, hes probably in the form of his career... We did have a few issues when I was playing, but such things are part of the game and well forgotten now. I respect him as a player and have never seen him bat better.         
	On Rahul Dravid being made to open         
	Im okay with it, but the point is that Dravids out of form... He needs to take a break, get away from it all...         
	On having telephoned Dravid the other day         
	We spoke generally, nothing specific to this Test or series.         
	On whether age is a factor in international cricket         
	Age is irrelevant these days as long as youre healthy and fit and your mind is strong... The players are much better looked after nowadays, theyve got good minders and follow a regimen... Somebody whos 35 today is like somebody who was 30 till some years ago... I dont see why players cant play till theyre 40... The main issue for the senior players is whether they can stay away from the family for long periods...         
	On Ricky Pontings men being one win away from equalling the record set under his captaincy, that of 16 consecutive Test wins         
	If they do, it will be a great achievement... When youre playing, you try and set the benchmark, get one step further than somebody else... If they win this Test then theres no knowing how many theyll win... Im happy that my legacy continues.         
	On whether he could come back to the Australian dressing room as coach         
	Doubt it very much... I really enjoy the role of mentoring, so thats a possibility... Coach or selector, no.         
	On the buzz in some quarters that the Indian Board had been keen on him as coach         
	Is it? No one told me... In any case, coaching isnt on my radar.         
	On why Greg Chappell wasnt successful with Team India         
	The problem for an India coach is that the selectors and the country want immediate results... If youre trying to build something for the future, then you dont have the time to set things right... In some ways, the problem in India is the lack of patience. You need four-five years to get results... Youve got to pick a core group of players and be patient with them. Have belief in them.         
	On the quality of umpiring in the ongoing Test         
	My views are very well known... Umpires can have a bad day just like batsmen play a bad shot or bowlers bowl a bad spell... Having said that, the umpires must also be accountable.         
	On whether the appalling umpiring on Day I could cost India the Test         
	If they allow it to... They shouldnt be thinking of the decisions.         
	On whether hes in touch with Udayan, the home for the children of leprosy sufferers         
	Oh yes... I know I havent been able to go there for some years but, last week, I sent funds for a total revamp of the playing fields. If all goes well, Ill be in Calcutta later this year.         
	On investing in India         
	Something is on the verge of being finalised in the South... Theres a hitch over the land, but I expect things to get sorted out.         
	Finally, on Lynette, who underwent brain surgery to remove a clot in 2006         
	(Emotionally) Shes recovered... Its such a relief for the family... Her illness did put a few things on hold.         
	Footnote: Lynette, for her part, maintained: Im indeed fine, thank you very much.

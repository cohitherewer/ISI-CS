The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj-Harbhajan face off today
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yuvraj-Harbhajan face off today
                      
	Mohali: With no word still on Sachin Tendulkars Indian Premier League (IPL) debut on Friday, Kings XI Punjab will be eager to take the opportunity to clinch an elusive win at home turf against Mumbai Indians here.         
	The Yuvraj Singh-led Punjab team, having lost both their matches are bound to be under pressure to record a victory as they would be again playing before their home crowd.         
	Though Yuvraj is one of the most dangerous batsmen in this format of the game, he is yet to unleash his real firepower. He scored 23 and 57 in his previous two matches.         
	Other top batsmen such as Mahela Jayawardene and compatriot Kumar Sangakkara would also look to play a big knock Friday.         
	Punjabs strike bowlers are yet to live up to their reputations. Right-arm fast bowler Brett Lee and left-arm pacer Irfan Pathan had both been unimpressive.         
	Sreesanth is yet to come good for Punjab as he has proved expensive in the six overs that he has bowled in two matches. The spin department, with Piyush Chawla in the forefront, has also failed to click.         
	Another thing to watch out for would be how Yuvraj tackles his statemate Harbhajan Singh. (PTI)

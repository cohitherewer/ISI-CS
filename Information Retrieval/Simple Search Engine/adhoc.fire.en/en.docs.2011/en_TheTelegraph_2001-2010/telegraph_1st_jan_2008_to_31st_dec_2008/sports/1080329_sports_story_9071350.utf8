The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwags the best ad for Test cricket, says Ramiz Raja
                                                     Sehwags the best ad for Test cricket, says Ramiz Raja
  - Former Pakistan captain, who has seen both 300s, salutes the dasher from Najafgarh       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ramiz Raja                                 
	Calcutta: Four years ago, former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja (then the Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive) was in the TEN Sports commentary box in Multan when Virender Sehwag smashed his maiden triple hundred. On Friday, he was wearing the Neo Sports colours when Sehwag got his second --- the fastest in history.         
	A couple of hours after the days play, a totally bowled over Ramiz (a one-time opener himself) spoke to The Telegraph from Chennai.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Sehwags second triple hundred         
	Words cant describe this innings... I mean, you could use all the adjectives and they may still not be enough... Sehwags flow, improvisation, the tempo... An absolutely brilliant innings... His partners (Wasim Jaffer and then Rahul Dravid) lacked his flamboyance, but the tempo of the innings didnt suffer. Clearly, he wasnt playing only for himself... Its because of this one innings that India have a great chance of going 1-0 up.         
	Comparisons with the Multan triple         
	Because that was a series in Pakistan and had been billed as a big one, the pressure had been a lot more... However, technically, Id rate the one on Friday better... The South Africans are very professional and you dont expect them to give anything away... Yet, Sehwags already taken 309! Whats remarkable is that the nature or quality of the attack doesnt bother him... The tempo, for example, wont suffer because hes up against the Australians.         
	Sehwags approach         
	I like his calm manner... his composure... I think his temperament is exceptional and the nervous 90s or the 190s or even the 290s arent for him... He gets past them in a flash, unlike most batsmen who start to weigh options when approaching milestones...My impression is that he doesnt play for milestones. In many ways, Sehwag reminds me of (Sir) Viv Richards and, today, hes the best advertisement for Test cricket... I wont be wrong in saying that this triple is going to attract many more to Test cricket... Just look at the records he erased in getting to his second triple.         
	His thoughts on Sehwag as a person         
	(Laughs) Let me first say that Im his lucky charm! Hes quite simple, doesnt seem to have airs and talks straight from the heart.         
	What he liked most in Sehwags triple No.2         
	A lot of things, really... Composed flamboyance, the command he exercised... Absolutely awesome... The six over slips, the cuts, the off-drives... Its said that Sehwag isnt strong on leg, but he got a lot of runs there...         
	Where would he place this innings?         
	Certainly the best in over a decade of doing TV commentary... Indeed, as a member of the media, I havent seen a finer knock... Overall, its difficult to say off-hand as, sometimes, even a 39 not out could be very crucial and have a big impact on the result.         
	Whether Sehwag will now be acknowledged as a great         
	Look, hes special and Id pay to watch him and not some of the others with better averages... Hes a first class entertainer.         
	On the Chepauk Test only being Sehwags third since his comeback in Perth         
	Well, yes... I interviewed him at stumps and he said hed been hurt at being dropped from Test cricket and was determined to prove a point... In the long run, consistency could be a problem with somebody like Sehwag, because of the way he plays, but when he gets going then the opposition is at a complete loss... He can give his team such a big advantage... Thats something which needs to be kept in mind... Even if hes not in form, he should be persisted with... Sehwag cant change his game and, if you ask me, he shouldnt be advised to do so.         
	Finally, whether Sehwag can break Brian Laras world record of 400 not out         
	He can, of course, provided he doesnt begin looking at the scoreboard... The pitch wont change much and the South African attack lacks variety... So, Saturday could well be a big day for Indian cricket in particular and world cricket in general.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Harbhajan Singh on Thursday described the wicket at the Chepauk as super pata.         
	Let me tell you one thing. The wicket is very, very flat and it is hard for the bowlers to keep running in with the same intensity in this heat, he said.         
	It was a first-day wicket and you cant rely on the patches You have to vary your line and length accordingly, Harbhajan added.         
	I think it was very important to win the toss, the off-spinner said.         
	But the Chennai wicket has always been like that. It has always been good for the batsmen for the first two-three days and then the spinners come into play. You cant really keep complaining.         
	Harbhajan agreed that Indias fielding was not up to the mark.         
	I think we gave away a lot of boundary balls, he said.         
	In the first session they got around 60-70 runs in boundaries. The first session is always important in a Test and they dominated it.         
	We did very well in the last two sessions and got those four wickets. It would be nice to have got one or two more wickets, but they batted well.         
	I think we gave around 20-30 runs and that makes a big difference. I hope tomorrow (Thursday) we put up a good allround performance. It would have been nice to stop those 30 runs and see the scoreboard at the end on 270 at four.         
	We need to get two early breakthroughs. Then the tail-enders come in and if we can mange to restrict them to 375 we are in with a cha- nce. They will find it difficult to bat in the second inn- ings.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mahroof out
                      
	Colombo: Sri Lanka allrounder Farveez Mahroof has been ruled out of the Asia Cup owing to an abdominal strain he sustained during training. Young left-arm medium pacer Thilan Thushara will be his replacement.         
	Mahroof, who missed Sri Lankas recent tour to the West Indies, also due to a muscle strain, suffered the injury while bowling in a practice match here.         
	An initial scan failed to reveal the injury but a second scan showed that he had strained the muscle on the left side of his abdomen. (PTI)

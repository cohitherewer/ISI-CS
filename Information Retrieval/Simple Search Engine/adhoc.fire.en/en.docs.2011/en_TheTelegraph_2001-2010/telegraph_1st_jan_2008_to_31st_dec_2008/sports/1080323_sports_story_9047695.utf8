The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The seniors cant be neglected, says Mahendra Singh Dhoni
                                                     The seniors cant be neglected, says Mahendra Singh Dhoni
  - Team Indias ODI captain sets the record straight         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE                                    
	Chennai: Team Indias ODI (and Twenty20) captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni spoke to The Telegraph at the Taj Connemara on Saturday evening.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Going by comments attributed to you the other day, it seems youre quite an angry young captain...         
	A Im not the type to run down anybody and, frankly, you cant ignore the contribution made by the seniors... The seniors cant be neglected... Having said that, because of everything thats going around, I wish to emphasise that I dont relate to this business of seniors and juniors... For me, its all about having the best team for the conditions one is expected to face... Its about having players wholl win you matches, not seniors and juniors... I did give my views to the selectors (before the tri-series squad was picked), but every captain does that, more so when all five selectors arent on tour.         
	But...         
	(Interrupting) What I said got misinterpreted... It has happened... I dont like controversies and certainly dont wish to get into one myself... As it turns out, Ive landed in one controversy... I didnt use the word senior anywhere in that interview (to a cricket portal), yet the headline had that... Ive been sharing the dressing room with the seniors for quite a few years now... I have, I believe, excellent relations with them.         
	Nevertheless, did you have an awkward moment when you met Sourav Dadi Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman at the team hotel this afternoon?         
	Well... One did feel a bit awkward as Dadis flight from Calcutta landed around the same time as mine from Bangalore... I went up to him and wished him happy holi and he said hed already had his innings at home yesterday! We had a light-hearted conversation and laughed... It became fine... Look, the seniors have been around for a long time and know each and everything... Know who says what and who means what...         
	Moving away from seniors and juniors... How did this short break after the tri-series go?         
	A few things needed to be done... Visiting mandirs in and around Ranchi was on top of the list... I spent four-five days at home and while I wasnt actually able to relax physically, the break was excellent for the mind... I dont think Id spent as many days at home at a stretch in the past year or so.         
	People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is up in arms because you sacrificed a goat in one of the mandirs...         
	(Laughs) Another controversy! I wont say anything, please. Main kuch nahin boolunga.         
	Of course, you managed time to zoom around in your Harley-Davidson...         
	Only in our colony... How can you zoom around if theres one police jeep in front of you and one at the rear?         
	Nearly three weeks on, how does it feel having captained a team which authored history in Australia?         
	Great... Feels great... Wed played very well in the Test series and it had been important to follow that up with a good performance in the tri-series... We succeeded in our goal. Every player had that determination to win. Whats more pleasing is that we defeated Australia 2-0 in a best-of-three finals... Two wins in three days, with Sachin Tendulkar producing such an amazing performance (117 not out and 91)... We didnt start the tri-series well, but kept improving in every department. As a captain, clearly, I couldnt have asked for more.         
	The one stand-out memory?         
	The rejoicing which followed our win... The emotional way the team celebrated... Out on the park, in the dressing room... Of course, every win in the tri-series had some special moment or the other.         
	You had to undergo a fitness test in Bangalore on Friday. Were you, at any time, worried that you could miss the first Test against South Africa?         
	I wasnt sure because of the injury to the second finger on my right hand... The injury occurred in Australia and though I was in pain, I was determined to complete the tri-series... Id also decided I wouldnt get an X-ray done as not even a fracture wouldve kept me out of the finals... The X-ray was done on returning home.         
	Thoughts in the lead-up to the Test series?         
	I keep things simple... Id like to enjoy the contest... Giving 100 per cent and enjoying the series is in my hands... Those are things I can control... I hope we start well by winning at the Chepauk...         
	Your Test debut had been at the Chepauk (versus Sri Lanka, in December 2005)...         
	Well, yes... Thats the time batting for me meant going after the bowling and trying to score off every ball... Ive evolved since then... Its about playing according to the situation.         
	In Tests, youre the vice-captain. Does moving from one chair to the other come all that easy?         
	Theres certainly much less pressure when youre not the captain... To an extent only, you can relax... Being able to do so does help.         
	Finally, Board president Sharad Pawar has confirmed that Sachin had a hand in your appointment as the Twenty20 and the ODI captain last year...         
	(Smiles) Having the confidence of the greatest cricketer is a terrific feeling... Im thankful to the players who were there in the World Twenty20 and in the tri-series for helping me prove Sachin right... Indeed, for a captain to be successful, his team has to perform. Mine did.

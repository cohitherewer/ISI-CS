                                                   Pak board optimistic

           
	Karachi: A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Monday it was too early to make a call on Australias tour of Pakistan and both the boards and players needed to stop making premature comments about the scheduled tour. There is still a lot of time left before the Australian tour. They are slated to come on March 10 so we are still nearly 10 weeks away from the tour. 
    
	So it is premature talk about the conditions in Pakistan. Things can change in a few days, the official said. 
    
	Meanwhile, the PCB said it could reschedule Zimbabwe teams tour to the country in case the parliamentary elections are postponed. A PCB official said they were waiting to see what happens in the next few days. (PTI)

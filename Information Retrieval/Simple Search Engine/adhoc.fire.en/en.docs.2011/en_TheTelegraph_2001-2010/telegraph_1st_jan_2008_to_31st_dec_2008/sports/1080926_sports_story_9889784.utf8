The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Call for modifying norms
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Call for modifying norms
    - REQUEST MADE TO BCCI CHIEF PAWAR; CHIEF SELECTOR VENGSARKAR MAY GAIN           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dilip Vengsarkar                                 
	Calcutta: Some affiliated units of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have requested outgoing president Sharad Pawar to have the norms for selectors  decided upon by the working committee last month  modified, thereby allowing an office-bearer to become eligible.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, a representation was formally made in Mumbai on Thursday morning. Pawar, one learns, got senior colleagues to brief him on the constitution (actually the Memorandum and Rules and Regulations) and will probably convey his decision on Friday.         
	The move, incidentally, has been initiated by the Andhra Cricket Associations rather ambitious secretary, Chamundeswarnath.         
	Current (senior) chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar, a Mumbai Cricket Association vice-president, could gain if an honorary office-bearer is allowed to become a paid selector.         
	However, while Vengsarkar is on excellent terms with Pawar, the same can hardly be said of the former captains relationship with president-designate Shashank Manohar and the next secretary, N.Srinivasan.         
	So...         
	As has been decided, all the selectors (on the senior, junior and womens committees) will be paid from the 2008-09 season.         
	Its understood that quite a few of the most influential within the BCCI feel the working committees decision is binding (on the issue of the norms, at least). Yet, others are of the opinion that the general body is supreme.         
	The latter group believes that the working committee has only made a recommendation. That contention couldnt be confirmed, though.         
	In any case, the norms will have to be modified (whatever the route taken) if the Establishments choice No.1 from Central, Narendra Hirwani, is to become a selector.         
	One of the norms, after all, states that the selector-to-be should have retired at least 10 years ago. Hirwanis last India appearance was in late 1996, but he quit cricket as recently as 2005-06.         
	The minutes of that working committee meeting will be approved at the AGM and, if there has been a mistake in representing what happened, then that will have to be rectified, remarked somebody close to the men who matter.         
	A modification/clarification may then be forthcoming during the AGM, which is scheduled for Saturday-Sunday, in Mumbai. All major decisions are likely to be taken on the opening day itself, with perhaps nothing at all left for Sunday.         
	Its still somewhat fluid, but as things are, its gathered that the following (listed by way of seniority) were being most strongly considered for the senior selection committee: Yashpal Sharma and Sanjeev Sharma, with the former favoured more (North), Krishnamachari Srikkanth (South), Gopal Bose and Raja Venkat (East), Surendra Bhave (West), Hirwani (Central).         
	Assuming nobody else comes into the picture in the next 24 hours, the chief selectorship will then go to Srikkanth, also a former captain.         
	If the norms do get modified and Vengsarkar stays on, then its possible that Srikkanth wont make himself available. In that case, Woorkeri Raman could come into the frame in a big way. Perhaps, even Syed Kirmani.         
	The Assam officials are lobbying for Rajesh Borah, but its now a straight fight between Bose and Venkat, a member of Bengals Ranji-winning squad in 1989-90.         
	Former captains Chandu Borde (West) and Gundappa Viswanath (South) were being talked about, but theyre ineligible as both have already been selectors for four years.         
	That bit got added in the BCCIs constitution last year, when it was amended. The selectors-specific clauses, however, are to come into effect from this weekend.         
	Significantly, the buzz is that the paid selectors will initially be appointed for just one year, not two.  
	NORMS FOR SENIOR SELECTORS  
	Those who have played for India, or those who have played more than 25 first-class matches  
	 He should have retired at least ten years ago  
	 The selector will be paid an annual honorarium of Rs 25 lakh   
	 The selector will not be an office-bearer of the BCCI or any of its affiliated units   
	Note: Decided by the BCCI working committee on August 23

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo face tough task
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dempo face tough task
                      
	New Delhi: I-league champions Dempo SC will have to play out of their skins against Bahrains Al Muharraq in Wednesdays away match if they want to stay afloat in the AFC Cup.         
	The 0-4 drubbing at home by the same opponents on April 2 has seriously dented the Goan sides chances of making it to the knockout phase of the tournament.         
	With the team now lying at the bottom of the four-team group with three points, collected from the 3-1 home win in the opening match against Al Ansar of Lebanon, Mauricio Afonsos team can ill-afford another reversal at the national stadium in Ar Rifa, 12 km south of Manama.         
	A win against the Bahrain league champions will put Dempos campaign back on track but Afonso knows that taming their opponents in their backyard would be a huge task.         
	To add to Afonsos woes, midfielder Anthony Pereira and defender Valeriano Rebello suffered injuries and stayed home along with seasoned central defender Mahesh Gawli.         
	Afonso is deputising for regular coach Armando Colaco, who is recuperating from a car accident. It will be a tough match. We are prepared to give our best and give them a hard time, Afonso said.

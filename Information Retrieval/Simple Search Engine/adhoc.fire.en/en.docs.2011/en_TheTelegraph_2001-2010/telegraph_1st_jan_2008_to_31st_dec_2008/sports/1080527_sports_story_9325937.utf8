	Sydney: Iraq face a year in the wilderness after Fifa suspended them from international competition on Monday and issued Baghdad an ultimatum.         
	The Fifa executive board announced it had imposed the ban after the Iraq government dissolved its national Olympic committee and national sport federations in breach of Fifa and Olympic regulations.         
	The board will recommend that the Fifa Congress, which meets on Friday, suspends Iraq for 12 months, but left the door open for a reprieve if Baghdad reversed its decision by 1400 GMT on Thursday.         
	The Fifa Executive Committee decided to suspend the Iraqi Football Association as of today.... following the governmental decree passed on May 20 which dissolved the Iraqi National Olympic Committee and all national sport federations, including the IFA, Fifa said.

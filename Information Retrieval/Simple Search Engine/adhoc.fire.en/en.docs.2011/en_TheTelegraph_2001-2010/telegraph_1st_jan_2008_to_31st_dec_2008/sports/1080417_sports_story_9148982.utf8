The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC in no hurry to open window
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ICC in no hurry to open window
  - Lillees presence in the dressing room will bolster our resolve, says DareDevils captain Sehwag             Kolkata Knight Riders players Brendon McCullum and Murali Kartik discuss a point at the team hotel in the city on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Mumbai: Malcom Speed, outgoing CEO of the International Cricket Council (ICC), on Wednesday said that there was no immediate need to carve out a slot for the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the Future Tours Programme at the moment.         
	The players know that the only reason they are approached for the Twenty20 is because they are the stars for their country. They have become good players because they have been brought up in the system within their country.         
	The IPL hasnt started yet. Before we go carving windows in the structure that is basis of the finances of all countries including the BCCI, lets see how good it is. There is no rush to do this, he emphasised.         
	Instead Speed said the biggest challenge facing the games administrators right now was how to integrate the Twenty20 format with Tests and ODIs to ensure that none had to face disinterest of the fans.         
	I wrote to the ICC that this current generation of cricket administrators will be judged not by how much money the game makes out of Twenty20 cricket, it will be judged by how well we integrate Twenty20 into the other forms of the game. We regard it as a challenge, not a problem, Speed told reporters here.         
	Meanwhile, English cricketers may be able to participate in the last two weeks of IPLs 2009 edition with their players association claiming that the countrys board was willing to soften its stand on the matter.         
	The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has made it clear that its players will not be allowed to play in the cash-rich league until 2010 due to their International commitments.         
	But, Professional Cricketers Association chief Sean Morris has claimed that the board will review its stand and players will get to play in the Twenty20 tourney next year albeit only in the later stages.         
	There will be a little bit of a window when England players return from the West Indies. They will then be able to participate in possibly last two weeks of that tournament in 2009.         
	I think they will play. It is going to be driven by market forces, the players will go and play Twenty20 cricket. It makes a lot of sense to allow them to play based on the fact that weve got the world Twenty20 coming up five weeks later, Morris told BBC Sport.         
	England captain Michael Vaughan also feels the top England players will eventually end up playing in the IPL.         
	We are naive to think England players arent going to end up in the IPL. England players will end up in the ipl, whether it is next year or the year after, he said.         
	Vaughans England teammate Kevin Pietersen has already described ECBs stand against releasing its centrally contracted players for the IPL as ridiculous.         
	In a related matter, the ICC has received a communication from the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) bankrolled by the Essel Group for recognition from the world governing council and the matter is under consideration, a top ICC official said on Wednesday.         
	There are two parts to that. Until recently the ICL had never sought recognition from the ICC, so it never asked the question. About ten days ago lawyers acting on behalf of ICL contacted ICC and sought recognition from the ICC, said Malcolm Speed, the outgoing CEO of ICC, on Wednesday during an interaction with reporters.         
	We are awaiting advice from our lawyers on that issue and I expect it within the next week or so (after which) well respond to the ICL lawyers, Speed added. (Agencies)

            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Jockey D. K. Ashish was simply brilliant, exhibiting his superior class on his way to a fine double which he scored for the visiting trainer Arti Doctor on Friday, the opening day of the monsoon season. The jockeys both winning rides  Queen Of Hearts in the 1,000m Bachelors Wedding Handicap and Apostrophe in the Cherry Handicap  were the course favourites who were ridden to perfection.           
	Trainer Javed Khan, too, notched up a double through Alarico and Helegonia to claim the lesser events  the Fair Ray Handicap and Woolver Valley Handicap. However, Helegonia had to win the race again in the stewards room following an objection lodged by jockey Dinesh Singh, the jockey of the second-placed horse Body And Soul.

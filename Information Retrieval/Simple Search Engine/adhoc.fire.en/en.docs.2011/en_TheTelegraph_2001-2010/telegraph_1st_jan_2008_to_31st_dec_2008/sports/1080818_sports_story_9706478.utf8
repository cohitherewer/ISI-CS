            A STAFF REPORTER            Hamar                           
	Calcutta: The title race in the Sahara CFL Premier Division is beginning to simmer nicely, as high-flying Mohun Bagan were held to a 1-1 draw by United SC at the Mohun Bagan ground on Sunday. The result leaves the green and maroons on 20 points edging Mohammedan Sporting on goal difference, with Shabbir Alis men slated to face East Bengal in a crucial tie on Tuesday.         
	Former Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharjee, currently the coach of United SC, took the field amidst mixed reactions. His boys played impressive football and took the lead in the sixth minute through Lal Malswama Hamar.         
	Mohun Bagans ploy of hitting long balls wasnt working as United SCs wily veteran Sashti Duley had a great outing. Jose Ramirez Barreto popped up with the equaliser in the 35th minute after United SC failed to clear a corner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | There will be more runs, says Mahela
                                                                                                                                                                                                       There will be more runs, says Mahela
            A CORRESPONDENT            Mahela Jayawardene                           
	Colombo: After two low-scoring games in the series for both sides, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene expects his batsmen to come good on the batting-friendly track of Premadasa and said that Chaminda Vaas was shaping up well to play in Sundays match.         
	The following are excerpts:         
	On Vaas injury         
	He bowled both the days. He looked pretty good. We will have another look at him tomorrow (Sunday) as well.         
	If the line-up has been finalised         
	I think it will probably be the same. The only concern will be Vassy on his fitness Just waiting for his clearance More or less it will be the same.         
	The wicket         
	It is a different wicket. Much firmer than it used to be here. The ball will probably come on to the bat better. So definitely there will be more runs.         
	Sundays match being a day-night encounter         
	Not much difference (in preparations) Lights here are very good. We have played a lot of cricket here. Dont think it is going to be huge factor. It is all about how you get used to the conditions and play on the day.         
	Vaas contribution to Sri Lankan cricket         
	Huge contribution. Especially in the sub-continent it is not an easy task to go for so long. I think he and Murali have done the job for us for quite some time. Now the young brigade is coming through, but these two have been the role models.         
	On the fragile Indian batting         
	I would not say that, for these are the people who are playing for quite some time. So you cant say that. It is just that probably you should give credit to our bowlers. So I think I am sure they will come strongly and we just have to be prepared.

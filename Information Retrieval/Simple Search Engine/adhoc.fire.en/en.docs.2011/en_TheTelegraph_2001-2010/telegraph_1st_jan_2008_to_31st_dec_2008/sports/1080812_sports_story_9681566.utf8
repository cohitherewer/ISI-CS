The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spanish cyclist fails dope test
                                                                                                                                                                                                     BEIJING BYTES
                      
	Spanish cyclist fails dope test  
	The first doping case at the Beijing Olympics involved a Spanish cyclist, Maria Isabel Moreno, thus again pointing the finger of blame at a sport and country both regularly linked to doping. Of course its a blow to cycling, the president of the International Cycling Union (UCI), Pat McQuaid said on Monday.  
	And its a Spanish rider, which shows that we have a problem in Spain. Its time that Spanish authorities start doing something concrete. For years, they have not been tough enough on doping and this is the result of their leniency, he added. Spains sports minister Jaime Lissavetzky told a news conference that the test was a stain on Spanish sport. But, he insisted that a new anti-doping law in his country had toughened sanctions against offenders and had doubled the anti-doping budget in Spain.         
	Youngest competitor         
	The Seychelles boasts 305 miles (491 km) of coastline, but Dwayne Didon grew up in a village at the top of a mountain and only learned to swim at the age of nine, when he started classes at a local pool. He quickly made up for the late start, becoming one of the best swimmers in his east African archipelago nation in just four years, and at 13 and 11 months, is the youngest male athlete competing in the Beijing Olympics.         
	Veiled athletes         
	 The women in Roqaya Al Ghasaras home town in Bahrain are so proud of their pioneering Olympic sprinter that some of them got together to design and sew a set of tailor-made aerodynamic veils for her to run in. Egyptian fencer Shaimaa El Gammal, a third-timer at the Olympics, will don Islamic headgear in Beijing for the first time. This year an unprecedented half a dozen Egyptian athletes, three Iranians, an Afghan and an Yemeni will compete with covered heads like Al Ghasara. They want to inspire other women in their countries to break away from Muslim stereotypes.         
	Forecast         
	 Beijing woke up to a cool but overcast morning on day three of the Olympics on Monday, after thunderstorms cleared away the citys notorious smog. Forecasters said cooler, wet weather would continue, easing fear that heat and humidity would make conditions intolerable for tennis players and others hunting medals outside air-conditioned venues.A third of cyclists dropped out of the mens road race on Saturday claiming the suffocating and dirty air had exhausted them. Thunderstorms doused the Chinese capital on Sunday and overnight, leaving the women cyclists coping with cold, slippery conditions instead of heat they expected.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies whisk torch to secret location 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aussies whisk torch to secret location 
                      
	Canberra: The Olympic flame arrived in Australia on Wednesday for the next leg of the torch relay and was immediately whisked away to a secret location to avoid protesters.         
	Criticism of Chinas human rights record has sparked protests in Greece, Paris, London and San Francisco. Many countries, including Australia, have responded by modifying routes and boosting security.         
	Yard-high fences were being erected along the route through the Australian capital, Canberra, where 80 runners will carry the torch on Thursday. The torch will thread along a 10-mile route that passes Parliament House and within 200 yards of the Chinese Embassy.         
	Hundreds of police will guard the torch to prevent the type of interruptions that have marked the relay in other cities in the flames global journey to the Beijing Olympics in August.         
	The flame arrived at an air base in Canberra from Indonesia. A group of four people waved Chinese flags outside the gate of the base; there was no sign of protesters.         
	Officials said the flames location was being kept secret between its arrival and the relay on Thursday because of the threat of protests.         
	I dont know, and I dont want to know, Australian relay organiser Ted Quinlan told reporters. Originally, it was going to a hotel but theres a distinct possibility its going to go to the embassy.         
	In Sydney, police on Wednesday stopped two people from unfurling a banner on the citys landmark Sydney Harbour Bridge that demanded freedom for Tibet from Chinese rule. They were handed on-the-spot fines of $95 (euro60) and released.         
	Police in Canberra sought to end lingering confusion about the role of Chinese security agents in the relay. Police chief Mike Phelan said three blue-clad Chinese flame attendants will always be near the torch but will have no official security role.         
	Chinese ambassador to Australia Zhang Junsai told a television news channel on Tuesday that Chinese security officials still may intervene, saying: If the flame is attacked I believe they will use their body.         
	Ian Thorpe, a five-time Olympic gold medallist swimmer who will carry the torch on Thursday, said the protests shouldnt be centered around a specific event. (AP)

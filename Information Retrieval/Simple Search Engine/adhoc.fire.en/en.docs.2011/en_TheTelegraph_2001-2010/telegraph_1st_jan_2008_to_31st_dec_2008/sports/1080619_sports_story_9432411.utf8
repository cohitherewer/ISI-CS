The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi, Paes in semis, Sania out 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bhupathi, Paes in semis, Sania out 
                      
	New Delhi: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi kept the Indian hopes alive in the Ordina Open by advancing to the semi-finals on a day when Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna bowed out of the $175,000 event in Shertogenbosch, Netherlands.         
	According to information received here, the second seeded Indian pair sailed past Spaniards David Ferrer and Marcel Granollers 6-2, 6-1 in 48 minutes to advance to the last four stage.         
	They will take on the winners of the match between Argentines Guillermo Canas and Juan-Martin del Porto and French combination of Arnaud Clement and Florent Serra.         
	In their opening match on Tuesday, they beat Yves Allegro and Sebastian Prieto 6-3, 7-6 (7-3).         
	Sania crashed out with a 2-6, 2-6 loss to Dutch Michaella Krajicek while Bopanna bowed out losing 2-6, 4-6 to Argentine Guillermo Canas.         
	The defeat means that Sania remains winless against Krajicek at 0-4. The loss also marks a disappointing end to the Hyderabadi girls build-up for next weeks Wimbledon.         
	In the lopsided match, Sania struggled to find her feet from the very start and lost her serve twice before Krajicek raced to a 5-1 lead in the first set that lasted barely half an hour.         
	The Indian could not recover from the opening setback and was thoroughly outplayed in the second set as well with Krajicek hardly breaking a sweat to finish it off in another 25 minutes.         
	Meanwhile, qualifier Bopanna cut a sorry figure in his match against Canas, also a qualifier but who has to his credit a win over world No.1 Roger Federer last year. The one-sided encounter lasted little over an hour.           (PTI)

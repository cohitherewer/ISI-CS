The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson wants to rule the world
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ferguson wants to rule the world
                  Ferguson                     
	Yokohama: Sir Alex Ferguson has demanded his Manchester United players leave a lasting legacy by becoming the first British side to win the Club World Cup.         
	The United manager insisted the potential rewards for travelling to the Far East outweigh the damage it could do his teams chances of retaining their Premier League title.         
	The nitty-gritty of it is for us to be world champions, Ferguson told a news conference on Tuesday. In 30 years time you look back and say Manchester United  world champions.         
	That, to me, is what our clubs all about and thats why its important for us to win it.         
	United, who arrived in Japan on Monday after drawing with Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend, face J-League side Gamba Osaka in Thursdays semi-final in Yokohama.         
	Its a big incentive to become world champions, said Ferguson. You cant win the Premier League in December.         
	Yes, its a little bit of a handicap, but thats what happens when youre successful. I hope were in Abu Dhabi next year because it means were successful.         
	He added: As far as Im concerned the incentives outweigh, without any question, whatever happens in the Premier League.         
	Fergusons side won the tournaments forerunner, a one-off match between the champions of Europe and South America, with a 1-0 win over Brazils Palmeiras in 1999.         
	United were beaten 2-1 on aggregate by Argentine side Estudiantes in 1968 when the Intercontinental Cup was played over two legs.         
	They are overwhelming favourites to win the new-look Fifa competition with Mexicos Pachuca and surprise Libertadores Cup winner LDU of Ecuador meeting in Wednesdays first semi-final.         
	Winning the Club World Cup would taste extra sweet for Ferguson after fierce rivals Liverpool lost 1-0 to Sao Paulo in the first tournament under the new format in 2005.         
	The media dont take it as seriously as we do, said Ferguson. Its an extra game for us but the prestige attached to the competition now is greater.         
	Even though he doesnt mind the extra load that the appearance in the Club World Cup brings to their tight schedule, Ferguson has unequivocally rejected the proposal that a 39th Premier League game be played in Asia as folly.         
	The plan, still-born after first being floated in February, received cautious backing from Asia last week but Uniteds fiery manager insisted there was no room in the calendar.         
	I dont think there will ever be a 39th game and I dont believe there should be, the Scot told reporters on Tuesday after Uniteds arrival in Japan for the Club World Cup.         
	Certainly Im not in favour of it. You look at our domestic programme allied to our cup competitions  its impossible.         
	Ferguson made no secret of his disgust when the Premier League initially made the proposal, claiming the clubs had not been properly consulted.         
	Asian soccer chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, along with Fifa president Sepp Blatter and Uefa chief Michel Platini, were also vociferous opponents. (REUTERS)

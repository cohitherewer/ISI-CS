The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL doors still closed for Shoaib
                                                                                                                                                                                                       IPL doors still closed for Shoaib
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP;AGENCIES            Shoaib Akhtar arrives to face the tribunal at the Pakistan Cricket Academy in Lahore on Wednesday. (AP)                           
	Calcutta/Karachi: Shoaib Akhtars international future was left hanging in the balance after the appellate tribunal set up to hear his appeal upheld the five-year ban, but only temporarily, deciding instead to revisit the appeal in June.         
	The tribunal allowed him to play outside Pakistan, specifically the Indian Premier League (IPL), but his participation hasnt been cleared by the IPL governing council. A senior BCCI official said their position of not allowing him to take part in the tournament remains the same as of now.         
	IPL commissioner and chairman Lalit Modi said the council would take a decision after receiving the tribunals order. I am not ready to give a statement as yet. I am still trying to get my governing council on board and I will try to get everybodys opinion before saying anything on the tribunal order, Modi told a Pakistani TV channel.         
	He also confirmed that PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf had spoken to him and informed that Shoaib had been allowed to play in the IPL.         
	We still have to look at the order copy and other things. He is still banned from playing in Pakistan. My question is why outside Pakistan, why cant he play in Pakistan? We have to still examine the implications. It is not a simple case, Modi said.         
	The IPL had earlier barred him from playing in the Twenty20 tournament in the interest of international discipline after the PCBs initial decision to ban him.         
	In a carefully worded statement on Wednesday, the tribunal said the ban would remain in place until it concludes its proceedings, but allowed Shoaib to play anywhere else in the world, including the IPL.         
	But since the ban has not been vacated as desired by Shoaibs lawyers and despite his dramatic public apology on Monday, for the moment his career appears to be at a dead end.         
	Justice (retd) Aftab Farrukh, who heads the tribunal, told reporters after a hearing at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore that the ban would stay until further proceedings, which will resume in June.         
	He said the lawyers for Shoaib had argued for suspending the ban but the tribunal felt circumstances did not allow for this. We dont think he has tried to reform himself. He has apparently repeatedly violated discipline and embarrassed the board, his teammates and the nation, Farrukh said.         
	The observations by the retired judge of the Lahore high court basically means that even the tribunal is undecided about the case and not convinced by Shoaibs public apology.         
	Farrukh, however, said in the interest of fair play, the tribunal had decided to allow Shoaib to play outside Pakistan for any team.         
	He cant play for Pakistan anywhere But there is no bar on him playing anywhere else in the world, Farrukh said.         
	This is also the order of the disciplinary committee of the board, he added.         
	It is learnt Shoaib managed to garner support from two of the members of the tribunal, but failed to get his way.         
	The apparent bid by Salman Taseer and Hasib Ahsan, the members of the tribunal, to give Shoaib a general pardon and have his five-year ban removed, was foiled by the legal counsel of the PCB and Farrukh.         
	Sources close to the proceedings said that after Shoaib made his dramatic unconditional apology, the members pushed for a general pardon for him.         
	One of them got a paper prepared pardoning Shoaib and wanted the tribunal members and legal counsels of both parties to sign it. But Farrukh disallowed this insisting the case must be decided on merit.         
	I dont see the IPL allowing him in. It will put them in a very embarrassing position trying to justify things because Shoaib remains a banned player in Pakistan, former Test captain and coach Javed Miandad said.

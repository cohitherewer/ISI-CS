	London: Everton missed the chance to confirm a place in next seasons Uefa Cup when they were beaten 0-1 by Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday.         
	Nicklas Bendtner headed the only goal after 77 minutes at the Emirates against a stubborn Everton side who needed just a draw to guarantee finishing fifth.         
	Defeat meant Everton can be overtaken by Aston Villa if they lose at home to Newcastle United on the final day of the league season next Sunday. Villa need to win at West Ham United to have any chance of overhauling Everton.         
	There is a lot of disappointment not to get the point but the performance was good, the players stuck at it. It is always difficult here because Arsenal have so much possession,         
	Everton manager David Moyes told Evertons website. We have been fourth or fifth all year and we want to hang on to it.         
	Arsenal showed little urgency in the second half before Armand Traores great run and cross gave Bendtner the chance to power in the winner.         
	Arsenal, who have 80 points, can still finish second. Chelsea, who have 81, play at Newcastle on Monday knowing defeat would hand the title to Manchester United.         
	Liverpool won their final home Premier League game, Fernando Torres notching his 32nd goal of the season in all competitions to earn a 1-0 victory over Manchester City.         
	Stoke City, meanwhile, were promoted to the Premier League when a drab 0-0 draw at home to Leicester City clinched runners-up spot for them in the Championship (second division) on a tense last day of the season on Sunday.         
	Third-placed Hull City, the only team who could have denied Stoke, were beaten 0-1 at Ipswich Town.         
	West Bromwich Albion, who had all but secured their promotion last Monday, return to the top flight as champions after a 2-0 victory at Queens Park Rangers put them on 81 points, two more than Stoke.         
	Stoke are now looking forward to their first season among the elite since 1985 and the 60 million ($119 million) windfall that promotion guarantees.         
	The 0-0 draw sent Leicester City down to League One, the third tier in English football for the first time.         
	They joined already relegated Scunthorpe United and Colchester United after Southampton, until 2005 a long-standing fixture in the Premier League, came from behind to beat Sheffield United 3-2 and crawl out of the bottom three.

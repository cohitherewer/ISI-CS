The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gritty century from Gambhir on Day I
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gritty century from Gambhir on Day I
  - Crucial partnerships with Sachin and Laxman help hosts reach 296/3       JAYDEEP BASU                                              Sachin at Kotla        
	New Delhi: Gautam Gambhir remembers to this day, the first time he walked into the Kotla, nurturing dreams of making it big. He would also not forget this day as he crafted his third Test century and second in succession in the series on his home turf on Wednesday.         
	The graceful left-hander put the Australian attack to the sword in a flawless exhibition of batting that belonged to the highest grade from the first ball. He lost two illustrious partners cheaply in Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid but revelled in the company of Sachin Tendulker and V.V.S. Laxman to make it a wonderful day for the hosts.         
	At the end of the first day, India, who were reeling at 27 for two after 11 overs, were 296 for 3 with the Delhi batsman still going strong with a career best unbeaten 149.         
	Gambhir put on 130 runs with Sachin Tendulkar (68) and also shared 139 runs with Laxman (54 batting) for the unbroken fourth wicket.         
	Gambhir knew every blade of grass that he scorched with his drives at the Kotla in an innings that befitted his reputation as an exciting stroke player.         
	For the Delhi opener, things were not easy in the middle. As he looked more and more invincible with the bat, the Australians did everything to break his concentration. Twice he was involved in spats with bowlers Shane Watson and Simon Katich and the second time the umpire had to intervene to stop Gambhir and Katich from going at each other.         
	They did everything to break my concentration, Gambhir later said. The way we batted, they had no other way. They were desperate to get me out. So, under such circumstances, it was very important for me to maintain my concentration, he added.         
	For Gambhir, it was a platform to make a strong statement on his batting prowess and the occasion was to his liking. Virender Sehwag had perished early to a beauty from Brett Lee but Gambhir drew strength from the setback to put India on course to dictate terms.         
	Gambhirs knock had the rhythm of a batsman who understands his job well. It had the right mix of caution and aggression and the Aussie bowlers were repeatedly thwarted in their attempts, as Gambhir picked gaps at will. In shape and appeal, the innings from the young opener carried the mark of class all over.         
	Gambhir hit 20 boundaries and one six during his 285-ball knock. Batting on 99, the opener hit the six, a majestic strike over long off to complete his hundred. In the previous over, Watson eyeballed the batman and Gambhir retaliated by elbowing the bowler on his way to complete the second run.         
	All these things do happen on the ground. It was an accident, Gambhir told the reporters later.         
	Tendulkar, who made 68 with 11 hits to the fence, was in sublime touch but lost his wicket when he looked good enough to score a hundred. He edged behind to wicketkeeper Brad Haddin off Mitchell Johnson in the last over before tea.         
	Like Tendulkar, Laxman too was a picture of composure and duly reached his 36th half-century in his 99th Test match. Dravids departure was of course a disappointment. He started well and then edged an outgoing delivery from Johnson to Matthew Hayden in the slips.         
	Harbhajhan Singh toe injury, meanwhile, kept him out of the squad, while captain Anil Kumble returns to the side to lead the spin department with Mohali hero Amit Mishra.

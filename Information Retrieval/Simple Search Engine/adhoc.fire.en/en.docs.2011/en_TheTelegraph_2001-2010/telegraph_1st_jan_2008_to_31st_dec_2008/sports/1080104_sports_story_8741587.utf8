                                                   Cilic: Victory over Davydenko still the best

      OUR CORRESPONDENT
           
	Chennai: When you are a teenager ranked outside the top 100 and pull off a breathtaking win over world No.4 Nikolay Davydenko, it is a shame if you are denied the credit because of allegations that your opponent didnt try hard enough. 
    
	The fact that Marin Cilic, now ranked 71 and fresh from reaching the quarter finals of the Chennai Open immediately responded to queries about a match that happened on October 25, 2007, would indicate that he is still smarting from that treatment. 
    
	Of course, from my side I was playing the best tennis that I could, he said with a shrug on Thursday after showing fifth-seeded Frenchman Nicolas Mahut the door. 
    
	A victory is a victory And that one, over Nikolay Davydenko, remains one of the best of my career. 
    
	It came during the best period of my career, too. 
    
	Cilic, who is the only Croatian to complete the Grand Slam as a junior, felt the height gives the Croatians the advantage when it comes to serving. 
    
	Following the tradition of former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic and world No.18 Ivan Ljubicic, Cilic slammed eight aces in his thrashing of Mahut, the last four during crucial points. 
    
	Obviously it is the height factor Thats what makes us better servers I guess 
    
	Cilic, who will take on Robin Haase in the quarters, felt his first round match was the toughest. 
    
	It was very, very difficult against Viktor Troicki. It was my first match of the new season and I was struggling after the first set. 
    
	Today it was more comfortable and I was in my groove. 
    
	Cilic had defeated Tim Henman en route to reaching the semi-finals of the Queens Club where he lost to eventual champion Andy Roddick. 
    
	Ask about his favourite surface and he replies all with a twinkle. 
    
	I like playing on all surfaces but grass is special, said Cilic who took up tennis at the age of five because his cousin used to play it

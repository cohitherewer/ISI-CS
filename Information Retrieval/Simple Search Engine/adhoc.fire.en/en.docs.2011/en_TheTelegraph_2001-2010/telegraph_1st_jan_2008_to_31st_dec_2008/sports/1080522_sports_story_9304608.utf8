	Madrid: The Spanish womens hockey teams place at the Beijing Olympics is in jeopardy after it emerged that two of its players tested positive for banned substances at an Olympic qualifying event in Baku last month. But Spanish hockey authorities have said there is evidence that the positives were part of a deliberate attempt to sabotage the teams chances during the tournament. Players and coaching staff complained about the organisation of the tournament on their return from Azerbaijan, some complaining of feeling ill after drinking water given to them by organisers during matches. Spain qualified for the Olympics after beating hosts Azerbaijan 3-2 in the final. However, according to FIH rules, if more than one member of a team tests positive, the whole team will be thrown out of the tournament. If Spain were disqualified, Azerbaijan would take their place in Beijing.

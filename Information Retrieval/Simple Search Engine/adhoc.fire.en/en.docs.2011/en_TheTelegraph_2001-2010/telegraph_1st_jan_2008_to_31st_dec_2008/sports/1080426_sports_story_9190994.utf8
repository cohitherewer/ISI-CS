The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gill tirade against sports minister
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gill tirade against sports minister
                      
	New Delhi: Under-fire Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill on Friday hit back at Union sports minister M.S. Gill for suggesting that younger administrators should head sports federations, saying younger people should first become sports minister.         
	In a scathing counter-attack, a defiant K.P.S. Gill said that there was no question of stepping down from his post in the wake of the bribe scandal and told the sports minister not to talk about accountability since he knew nothing about sports.         
	Let younger people first become sports ministers before such suggestions are made. I dont think age has anything to do with managing sports, a fiery K.P.S. Gill said.         
	Let not sports ministers talk of accountability or responsibility. Most of them dont know anything about sports and have never done anything for hockey. In the past five years, have you seen these ministers doing anything? he told a television channel on Friday.         
	What have these government bodies done for us? Where have they ever provided us with the funds or the facilities? They call it the national game, and do nothing for it, the IHF president said.         
	K.P.S. Gill, who has been under pressure to resign with MPs, the sports minister and several former players demanding his ouster, said other than Uma Bharti, none of the sports ministers had done anything for the game.

	Mumbai: Despite losing both their previous IPL matches to Chennai Super Kings, Kings XI Punjab are going into Saturdays semi-finals against the same opposition with a measure of confidence, captain Yuvraj Singh and coach Tom Moody said on Friday.         
	Its a different ground (Wankhede Stadium) and circumstances are different. We are coming into the game with greater confidence and will be looking to do our best, Moody said.         
	Captain Yuvraj said the team had learnt valuable lessons from their losses to Chennai and were keen not to repeat them.         
	We will try not to make the same errors again and will see where the opposition falters and try and take advantage, the stylish left-handed batsman said.         
	Our confidence is high and if we execute our plans properly, no doubt we can win, the Kings XI captain said.         
	About his form with the bat, Yuvraj said the runs he had in their last game would stand him in good stead.         
	I had some good form in the last game. It has come at the right time ahead of the semi-finals, he said referring to his 49 off 16 balls.         
	Our bowlers have bowled well. Its just that the wickets were flat, Yuvraj said.         
	He praised the batting of Shaun Marsh, who has accumulated nearly 600 runs in only 10 games.         
	Its been great to watch him and hes an important member of the team. We hope he does well Saturday too, he said.           (PTI)

                  Andrew Flintoff has some tips for a youngster after practice in Vadodara on Wednesday. The 30-year-old is recuperating from a fourth operation on his left ankle and has not played for England since the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa last year. (AP)                     
	Vadodara: Ajinkya Rahane (172) and Wasim Jaffer (151) helped West Zone take a 139-run lead over England Lions and give their team a hope for making the final of the Duleep Trophy.         
	West, who need to win against the Lions to top the group, finished their first innings at 494. At 14 for one on Day III, the Lions still look poised to force a draw and qualify for the final.         
	Resuming on 187 for one at the Moti Baug Stadium, the duo added 155 runs and the 342-run partnership for the second wicket before Steve Kirby got rid of Maharashtra batsman Rahane. His knock included 26 fours.         
	Kirby was once again proved to be successful dismissing Jaffer.         
	Yusuf Pathan blitzed 29 from 21 balls while the West Zone captain, Parthiv Patel, made a brisk 58.         
	Both Monty Panesar and Adil Rashid grabbed three wickets each as the last seven wickets fell for 103 runs. In the 12 overs before close of play, the Lions lost the wicket of first innings centurion Michael Yardy.

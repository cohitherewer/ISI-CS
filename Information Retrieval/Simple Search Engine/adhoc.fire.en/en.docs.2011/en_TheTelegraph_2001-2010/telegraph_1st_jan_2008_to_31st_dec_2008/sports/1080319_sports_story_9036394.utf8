                                                     Sidebottom revels in Mr Reliable role
            DEREK PRINGLE in WELLINGTON            Ryan Sidebottom                           
	Englands levelling of the series, following their 126-run victory against New Zealand in Wellington, was the sum of many parts. The 164-run partnership between Tim Ambrose and Paul Collingwood and the five-wicket haul by James Anderson that followed, were both crucial factors and ones Michael Vaughan rightly paid tribute to. But Test captains like nothing more than a dependable bowler to call upon and none fits that description better than Ryan Sidebottom.         
	Since being recalled to the England side last May (he made his Test debut against Pakistan at Lords in 2001 and was dropped after the match), Sidebottom has assumed the role that Vaughan always earmarked for Matthew Hoggard. And yet it was Hoggards injury during the first Test of last summer that allowed Sidebottom into the side in the first place, an irony not lost on the former Mr Reliable now he is out of the team and carrying the drinks.         
	Wellington was Sidebottoms 12th Test and he finished it with six for 141, five of them in New Zealands second innings. With 10 wickets in the opening Test at Hamilton, his overall Test tally now stands at 45  not a bad strike-rate for a 30-year-old pace bowler starting over again.         
	The sudden emergence of Sidebottom from county cricket, fully formed and able to hold his own on the international stage, suggests there are more undiscovered gems around the shires.         
	In truth, the selectors had long identified him as a potential Test bowler only for former coach Duncan Fletchers theories about speed  that bowlers need to propel the ball at 85mph or above to be effective  to bar his way.         
	Word of Fletchers Rule must have got back to him for he has built up the muscle on his torso and shoulders and put on an extra yard of pace. He says he bowls no differently now to when he plugged away in county cricket for Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, but it is not true and he strives to hit the pitch with far more venom than even a year ago.         
	That extra pace can sometimes interfere with swing, but Sidebottom still has the knack of getting the ball to curve through the air, especially when it is new. Both Daniel Vettori and Kyle Mills fell to swingers early on the final morning in Wellington, a double strike that stopped any Black Cap ambitions of stealing a win dead in their tracks.         
	Englands gain might not have happened had Stephen Fleming not spotted his potential while captain of Nottinghamshire. A shrewd cove, Fleming encouraged him to set his sights on a recall, something he may be regretting now that Sidebottom has dismissed him twice during the series.         
	Fleming has been fantastic for my career, said Sidebottom. He pushed me a lot to play for England. Its great bowling to him and a challenge. He wont want to get out to me but its been nice trying to work him out. Ive got him twice but with an important Test to go, Id like to get him more if I can.

                                                   Triple was only a matter of time, says Viru coach
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: When the entire nation was waiting with bated breath for Virender Sehwag to complete his triple hundred in Chennai on Friday, in Delhi, his coach and mentor AN Sharma was unperturbed.         
	I knew he would do it, said Sharma with an air of predictability on Saturday. The way he was batting, I was confident that it was only a matter of time before he reaches 300. I watched him bat till the time he crossed 260 and then left for my coaching centre. I was sure he would get to 300. Of course, I was disappointed that he couldnt reach the 400 mark. But thats part of the game.         
	Sharma, one of Delhis most respected cricket gurus, has been coaching the dasher from Najafgarh since his school days. As a coach of the Government School in Vikaspuri in West Delhi, Sharma spotted Sehwag as a talented teenager and then moulded him into a champion batsman.         
	Apart from his record-breaking score  the highest by an Indian  Sehwags attitude has also pleased the coach. He played his natural game. That makes him special. Aggression is his strong point. I am happy that he stuck to it throughout.         
	Sharma said he had no doubt that his ward would make a comeback after he was dropped. I was certain he would come back with a vengeance. Nothing can distract him from cricket. A wonderful student of the game, Sehwag is an asset to any team.         
	While Sharma and other members of the Delhi team went gaga over the openers achievement, Sehwags family chose to distance themselves from the hype on Saturday.         
	The huge number of reporters who gathered around Sehwags Hauz Khas bungalow in South Delhi, were not allowed inside. We had a family party Friday night that went up till 4am. Please dont disturb us today. We are tired of talking to the media, said Sehwags brother through the speaker phone attached to the gate.

	Mumbai: Praising his teammates for defending a low total and stunning the high-flying Delhi DareDevils in Sundays IPL match, Mumbai Indians stand-in captain Man-of-the-Match Shaun Pollock said the players have finally come to terms with the Twenty20 format.         
	After leading the side to their second successive win that followed four straight losses, Pollock said, We played very well in the last two games. Both the juniors and seniors are doing well. The players have now begun to understand the game.         
	For the former Proteas skipper, who top-scored with 33 before bagging two wickets for sixteen, 162 was a competitive total.         
	I thought 162 was competitive. We bowled very well and took some good catches. We stuck to our plans and the crowd also supported us very well. At times I found it difficult to communicate to my players because of the noise, but the crowd support lifted us.         
	Pollock said that it was important for the team to get in-form rival openers out early.         
	For us it was important to get the openers early. Once we dismissed Sehwag we knew we had a chance, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Delhi DareDevils skipper Virender Sehwag squarely blamed his batsmen for his sides shocking 29-run defeat against the Mumbai side.         
	Our bowlers bowled superbly. But while batting we kept on losing wickets at regular intervals and the asking rate went up. It was batting failure which was responsible for the defeat, Sehwag said.

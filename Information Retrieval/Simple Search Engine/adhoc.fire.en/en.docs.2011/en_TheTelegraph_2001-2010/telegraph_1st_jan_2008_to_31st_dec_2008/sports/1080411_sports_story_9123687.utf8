The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tevez finds target as United cruise
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tevez finds target as United cruise
    - Ferguson set for a romantic return to Nou Camp           HENRY WINTER in MANCHESTER                                             Carlos Tevez celebrates his goal against AS Roma at Old Trafford on Wednesday. (AP)      
	Manchester United on Wednesday night booked themselves a romantic return to Barcelona, scene of Sir Alex Fergusons greatest triumph, but the English champions know it will be anything but a gentle stroll down the Ramblas.         
	Roma were toothless, incapable even of taking a penalty on Wednesday, and Barcelona boast a far sharper cutting edge. Samuel Eto, Thierry Henry and Bojan Krkic lie in wait at the Nou Camp on April 23 yet United will travel full of hope to the scene of their 1999 European Cup final triumph over Bayern Munich.         
	It was not simply the confident way they brushed aside disappointing opposition to reach the semi-finals of a fascinating Champions League. Nor was it simply the brilliant way they prevailed in Rome, or the diving flicked header from Carlos Tevez that brought further embarrassment to the Italians here. United brim with reasons to be cheerful. The depth of their squad was shown vibrantly on Wednesday night. Ferguson even gave his best player, Cristiano Ronaldo, the evening off, restricted Wayne Rooney to a 16-minute cameo and United still prevailed.         
	Led by Owen Hargreaves, Fergusons understudies sparkled. Gerard Pique rarely looked troubled at centre-half, Mikael Silvestre slotted back in well at left-back after seven months out while Ji-Sung Park was energy personified. But it was Hargreaves who most impressed, creating Tevezs goal and comfortably being the man of the match for a display brimming with box-to-box dynamism.         
	Granted a licence to raid forward, Hargreaves excelled, constantly probing upfield, and whipping in some good crosses from the right. Victory not only confirmed Uniteds presence in the final four but also ensured they broke the European record of 11 consecutive home wins which they had shared with Juventus.         
	On an evening of manifold encouragement, United were delighted to watch Daniele de Rossi squander a penalty, see Rio Ferdinand survive 90 minutes after his bruised-foot scare and then give a raucous welcome back to Gary Neville, the full-back charging around the pitch as though trying to make up for 13 months on the sidelines in nine minutes.         
	The Italians, lacking belief with Francesco Totti still injured, threatened on occasions. De Rossi, a midfielder much admired by Ferguson, dribbled through and set up Mirko Vucinic, whose drive was blocked by Edwin van der Sar.         
	Back came United, producing the move of the half. Brown lifted the ball towards the centre circle where Tevez controlled it on his chest, before sweeping it out to Hargreaves. Spotting Giggs hurtling towards the far post, Hargreaves found his captain with another terrific cross. Giggs connected sweetly with the ball and again the excellent Doni saved.         
	The attention was dragged immediately to the other end as the game exploded into life. After Van der Sar had pushed away Vucinics shot, Alessandro Mancini collected possession and ran at Brown. The Brazilian nudged the ball past the full-back, who slid in to intercept, making contact with Mancinis foot and the ball.         
	Mancini sensed the challenge and began falling, at which point the sliding Brown caught the wingers trailing leg with his left foot. Penalty, screamed all the Roma players with some justification. Penalty, decreed the Norwegian referee.         
	As tempers boiled over in the dug-out, De Rossi placed the ball on the spot, never exuding any real belief in his task. De Rossi drilled the ball high over the Dutchmans bar, several rows back into the Stretford End.         
	With 20 minutes remaining, Tevez began and finished a terrific move. Scampering through from midfield, the Argentine released the ball right to Hargreaves. Tevez continued his run, speeding towards the near post.         
	Hargreaves found Tevez with a superb ball, which the diving striker flicked across Doni and in. Tevez lifted his shirt to reveal a T-shirt message stating Happy Birthday Ariel. His header ended any distant dream Roma may have harboured of an unlikely recovery.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Late penalty saves Reds the blushes
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Late penalty saves Reds the blushes
                              
	Brussels: Liverpool, the 2005 champions, relied on a controversial stoppage-time penalty by captain Steven Gerrard to secure a 1-1 home draw with Atletico Madrid and remain level on eight points with the Spaniards at the top of Group D.         
	Barcelona and Sporting advanced to the Champions League knockout stage while Inter Milan missed the chance to guarantee their place on Tuesday.         
	A 1-1 draw at home to Basel was enough for Barcelona to qualify from Group C alongside Portugals Sporting, who beat Ukraines Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0 thanks to Brazilian striker Derleis 73rd-minute strike.         
	Substitute Lionel Messi put the Spaniards en route to the next phase when he fired the home side in front in the 62nd minute, though Basel gave the Primera Liga leaders a fright with an equaliser from Eren Derdiyok eight minutes before the end.         
	It took us a bit of effort to get into the match and exert our superiority, Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said in a television interview. But we have qualified for the last 16 and thats great news.         
	The Liverpool captain converted from the spot after he was challenged in the box by Mariano Pernia and Swedish referee Martin Hansson awarded a debatable penalty kick.         
	If it was in the middle of the pitch it would be a free-kick. It was in the box and it was penalty. We deserved at least to score, Liverpool coach Rafa Benitez said of the late penalty.         
	The manner of the draw was harsh on Atletico, having gone ahead through a goal of supreme quality by Rodriguez.         
	The Argentine deftly slipped past defender Jamie Carragher in the box to score from Antonio Lopezs smart overlapping run and cross.         
	Serie A champions Inter needed an 80th-minute header from striker Julio Cruz to salvage a 3-3 draw in Cyprus against a resilient Anorthosis Famagusta.         
	Inters draw, combined with Panathinaikoss 3-0 win at Werder Bremen, left Group B wide open with two matches remaining. The Italians are top on eight points from four games, Anorthosis have five, Panathinaikos four and Werder three.         
	Vangelis Mantzios made it 1-0 for Panathinaikos with just under an hour gone, Giorgios Karagounis lashed in a perfect half-volley for the second and Alexandros Tziolis made certain when his first-time shot on the rebound wrong-footed goalkeeper Tim Wiese.         
	Mario Balotelli and Marco Materazzi put Inter ahead twice against Famagusta, but a string of defensive errors allowed Cedric Bardon and Georgios Panagi to equalise twice.         
	Another poor clearance allowed Nikolaos Frousos to fire the home side in front five minutes after the break before substitute Cruz saved the Serie A sides blushes.         
	There were incredible individual errors. They really were gifts even if Christmas is still a way off, Inter coach Jose Mourinho told reporters.         
	Group A has a similarly tight look to it, with Chelsea on seven, one more than Roma and Girondins Bordeaux who beat CFR Cluj 2-1. The Romanians are still in contention with four points.         
	After their draw, Liverpool and Atletico are favourites to progress from Group D where Olympique Marseille and PSV Eindhoven are five points behind after the French side defeated their Dutch opponents 3-0.         
	Ivory Coast striker Bakari Kone collected a fine through ball from France forward Hatem Ben Arfa to race into the box and open the scoring half an hour into the clash between the two bottom teams in Group D.         
	Kone was also involved in Marseilles second goal, sending a cross that Senegal striker Mamadou Niang volleyed home from close range just after the hour. Niang was on target again for Marseilles third goal from another Ben Arfa pass on 71 minutes.         
	Former European champions Marseille, who had lost their first three matches, join Eindhoven on three points with the two sides still hoping for at least third place in the group to continue in the Uefa Cup.

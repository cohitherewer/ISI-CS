The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sledging has its charm, feels Irfan Pathan
                                                     Sledging has its charm, feels Irfan Pathan

	Adelaide: Team India left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan has said he is comfortable with some banter as long as those are within acceptable limits.         
	A day after BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said the board would seek a ban on sledging in next weeks ICC chief executives committee meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Pathan appeared in favour of sledging.         
	Sledging has been a part of the game and carries a certain charm about it. As a fast bowler, I dont think staring down at a batsman or similar such stuff is bad, he said. But it should be within limits, he added.         
	The left-arm paceman, who hasnt looked back since his heroics in the Perth Test, is satisfied with his form and fitness.         
	He defended Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singhs lack of form.         
	Among the Indian players, Sachin Tendulkar stayed away from the outdoor and went for the indoor nets, which has been his routine since the one-dayers began at the start of this month.         
	The outdoor nets, though, held interest for a few batsmen. Robin Uthappa, who has batted in only two of his four innings so far and in one of them didnt come to face a single delivery, batted as if to take the cover off every delivery.         
	Yuvraj himself tried very hard. He hit big and long but in between there were those usual swishes outside the off-stump and awkward fending off short-pitched deliveries. Pathan and Munaf Patel tested him out in all seriousness.                   (PTI)

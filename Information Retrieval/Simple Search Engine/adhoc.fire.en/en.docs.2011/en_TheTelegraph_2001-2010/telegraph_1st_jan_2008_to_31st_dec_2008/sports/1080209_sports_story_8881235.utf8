The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rohan tipped for doubles
                                                Rohan tipped for doubles
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: India Davis Cup captain Leander Paes was not ready say who would partner Mahesh Bhupathi in the crucial doubles match on Saturday, with the tie against Uzbekistan level at 1-1.         
	Officially Prakash Amritraj, who was down with a stomach ailment, has been named Bhupathis partner but Paes hinted that the in-form Rohan Bopanna could be his choice.         
	Bopanna is playing great tennis, Paes said. He is ranked 57 in doubles at the moment, said the captain as Bopanna, sitting beside Paes, nodded in agreement.         
	We are favourites to win the doubles. Mahesh can win with any of the two players  Rohan or Prakash. Since Rohan is the in-form player, he is the most obvious choice. But wait till tomorrow to see who gets the berth, Paes said.         
	A final decision, Paes said, will only be taken after he speaks to Bhupathi.         
	Doubles is very important for us. I will speak to Mahesh, it is important for me to take his input. I will speak to Rohan and Prakash also and then decide. We cannot risk too much with the doubles team. We will surely be up 2-1 after tomorrow, Paes said.         
	Sources in the Indian camp say that Paes is very much in favour of fielding Bopanna for the match. But in case Bhupathi asks for Prakash, the captain would have to reassess the situation.         
	It is nice to have options but it is important as a captain to make the right choice, Paes said.         
	There is speculation that Prakash also might be brought in at the last moment as he needs to get a feel of the court before Sundays reverse singles. With Somdev Dev Varman losing to Denis Istomin, Prakash is almost certain to replace the youngster in the reverse singles.

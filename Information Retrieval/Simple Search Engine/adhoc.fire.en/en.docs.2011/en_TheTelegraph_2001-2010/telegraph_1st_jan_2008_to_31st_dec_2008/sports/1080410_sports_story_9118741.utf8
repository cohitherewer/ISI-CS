The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Legalise betting: Bindra
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Legalise betting: Bindra
                      
	Mohali: India should take a cue from England and Australia and legalise betting, which will not only eliminate the menace of match-fixing but also fill government coffers, feels ICCs principal advisor-designate I. S. Bindra.         
	If betting is legalised, it will be in the interest of the government as not only will it eliminate match-fixing but also earn states revenue in crores. The board, too, will stand to benefit, Bindra, who also heads the Punjab Cricket Association, told reporters.         
	My personal view is that if you want anything to be regulated, it has to be legalised, he said.         
	Media estimates suggest bets ranging anywhere between Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 crore are placed on an ODI match. By that magnitude, one can imagine that government can easily earn Rs 5,000-7,000 crore as entertainment duty and other things, Bindra added. In England and Australia betting already enjoys legal status. (PTI)

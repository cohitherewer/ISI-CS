The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Even 150 will be tough, says Arthur
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Even 150 will be tough, says Arthur
            OUR CORRESONDENT                      
	Kanpur: South Africa coach Mickey Arthur on Saturday said that match was still open. The 39-year-old told a news conference that Indias lead of 20 runs was not that significant and if the South Africans manage a lead of 150 then things would be tough.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His take on the match         
	The game is hugely tight at this stage. India have a lead of 20 or so but it is not significant. But a lead of 40 or 50 will be quite a bit. A target of 150 will be pretty challenging in the fourth innings on this surface. We need to get that last wicket ASAP (as soon as possible).         
	The wicket         
	Theres always something happening on this wicket, its a fifth day wicket on Day II. This has played a little better than expected, but not ideal for Test cricket.         
	Indias batting         
	They got four 50-plus partnerships in a row which helped them to take a lead. They are 2-3 per cent ahead of us.         
	On Paul Harris, the only specialist spinner         
	It was part of our decision making. Harris bowled some good spells but was unlucky on any other day he could have taken five wickets

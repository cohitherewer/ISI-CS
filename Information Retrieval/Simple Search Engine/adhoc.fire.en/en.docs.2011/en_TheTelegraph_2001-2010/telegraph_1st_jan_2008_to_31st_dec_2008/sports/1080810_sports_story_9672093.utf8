The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev slips to tied 7th
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev slips to tied 7th
                      
	Bloomfield Township (Michigan): Jeev Milkha Singh turned in a roller-coaster fourover 74 to slip to the tied seventh spot even as Jyoti Randhawa and Daniel Chopra fell by the wayside after the second round of the 90th PGA championships .         
	Overnight joint leader, Jeev found the going tough at the Oakland hills, nicknamed the monster, as he dropped seven bogeys against three birdies to take his total to two-over 142.         
	The seasoned pro was off to a sedate start and parred the first five holes before picking up a birdie on the sixth that kicked off his topsy-turvy day.         
	A bogey on the seventh followed by a birdie on the ninth left the erratic Indian one-over at the turn.         
	Jeevs backward journey started with a bogey on the 10th before he dropped four more shots between the 13th and 18th holes. A birdie-brace on the 11th and 12th was the only highlight of his eventful backnine.         
	If Jeevs had a nightmarish day, Randhawa and Chopra were even worse carding 76 and 75 respectively.         
	While Chopra finished with a total of 10-over 150, Randhawa singed off two strokes adrift.         
	At the top, American J. B Holmes (68) grabbed a one-stroke lead with a total of one-under 139. The trio of Charlie Wi (70), Ben Curtis (67) and Justin Rose (67) were tied for the second spot.

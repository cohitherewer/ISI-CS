The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto nets a hattrick 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Barreto nets a hattrick 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Lalawmpuiya congratulates Jose Ramirez Barreto after one of his goals on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto is not the magician he used to be a few years back. A lot of critics have pointed out that he has lost speed. But the Brazilians hattrick on Tuesday showed he still could turn a match on its head single-handedly.         
	Defending champions Mohun Bagan rode Barretos three goals to beat United SC 3-1 at their home ground on a day when relentless rain lashed the ground and made quality football impossible. United scored their only goal in the 71st minute through Achinta Saha.         
	For the spectators, it was a very familiar scene at the end of the match. A spectacle that was quite regular a few years back, but a rarity in the recent past. The slogan Barreto, Barreto once again filled the air around the stadium and the green-and-maroon supporters, who came to the ground braving the rain, went home contended.         
	Despite the challenging conditions, both sides played with a good pace and the match was evenly contested until Barretos first goal. The Brazilians brilliance made the difference between the two sides and United coach Anjan Nath admitted it at the end of the match.         
	We made some mistakes But Barreto made all the difference. He might not have the same pace But has the same brains. Barreto saved Bagan today, Nath said.         
	The match was halted for about five minutes towards the end, with the United players appealing to the referee for bad light. The conditions really looked difficult for football at this point of time with a heavy cloud cover and torrential rainfall. However, visibility improved and the match started again.         
	Mohun Bagans all three goals came from the combination of Ishfaq Ahmed and Barreto. The Brazilian played a one-two with Ishfaq to superbly net the opener in the 26th minute. He himself started the move and finished it after reaching the perfect position to meet Ishfaqs cross. The second and the third goals came in the 53rd and the 59th minutes to end all hopes for United. Barretos header found the mark following a precise centre from Ishfaq from the left flank.         
	Ishfaq, who constantly changed flanks to avoid the marking, set up the third goal with a cross from the right. Malswamtluanga played a dummy for Barreto, who calmly placed it with his left foot.         
	Achinta reduced the margin for United from Gouranga Duttas pass, beating an advancing Sangram Mukherjee.         
	The Bagan defence stood firm under the late pressure and were almost unbeatable in the aerial balls. Uniteds Argentine striker would need some time to acclimatise to the wet grounds in the city and had to be substituted in the 68th minute. Bagans Rahul Kumar also looked completely misfit and one wonders how he was kept on for the full duration.

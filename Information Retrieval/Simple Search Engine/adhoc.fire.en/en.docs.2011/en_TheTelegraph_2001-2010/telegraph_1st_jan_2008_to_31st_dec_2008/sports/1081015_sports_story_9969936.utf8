                                                                                                                                                                                           Aussie media slams Sourav
                      
	Melbourne: The Australian media has once again targeted Sourav Ganguly. The media here poured vitriol on the former India captain, accusing him of indulging in delaying tactics to ensure the Bangalore Test ended in a draw.         
	The popular belief here is that Australia were destined to win the Bangalore Test but the existing light rule, coupled with Souravs delaying tactics, denied Ricky Pontings men victory.         
	A member of the National Nine News sports team took a potshot at anyone and everyone but was particularly harsh on Sourav, whom he described as a serial offender.         
	Serial offender Sourav Ganguly firstly persuaded the umpires to go off. Then when play resumed, Ganguly made Australias fielders and partner V.V.S. Laxman wait an eternity because hed apparently forgotten to put his thigh pad on.         
	Please! Cant you be timed out in this game? he wrote.           (AGENCIES)

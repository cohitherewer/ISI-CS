The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Good start is the key: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Good start is the key: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dambulla: Team India ODI skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Sunday said that the start from the openers was very important and there would be added responsibility on the opening duo of Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag in the one-dayers.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	If the comfortable win in the practice game gave added confidence         
	Well, we were never low on confidence, it was good to have a good start. We got used to the conditions in Sri Lanka which are different, and it was a nice experience for the bowlers on where to bowl on these wickets.         
	How important is the start from the openers         
	Any form of cricket, the start is very important, but it doesnt mean the entire pressure is on the openers to give you a good start. Viru is the sort of player who takes a fair amount of risk, he is a stroke player, but whenever he gives us a good start we have a fair chance of winning. He is in very good nick, Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag did well in the Tests also. They will have added responsibility but no real pressure.         
	On Indias plans         
	Youll get to know if we have made plans or not.         
	The combination of the side         
	Not really had a thought on it, but well look to play with five bowlers. Who the bowlers are we havent decided. We are looking at a six-five combination. All till now are available (for selection).         
	The Sanath Jayasuriya factor         
	Jayasuriya can be compared to Sehwag or Gilchrist. Its important not to let them have a good start. They are the sort of batsmen who will take chances. So if we try and restrict them, they will commit mistakes. All these players are very different, but for someone like Jayasuriya, its important to get him out early.         
	On Virat Kohli         
	Depends on whether he gets a chance. Theres pressure because he has come in place of Sachin Tendulkar. Its not that he is replacing Tendulkar. Hes second in line. The extra batsman before him will get a chance and then Badrinath will get a chance.         
	On Indias bowling         
	We havent been bowling at our best. The last two series, most of the wickets were favourable for batsmen. No worries, we can probably do a bit better on placid tracks as well, but we are working on that.         
	The lack of experience in the team         
	If you have players who have played more than 250 ODIs, more than 150 ODIs, I dont think it makes much of a difference. The seniors have played more than 300, but when it comes to experience, when you play over a 100, you will know quite a bit about one-day cricket.         
	If the Indians are looking to play two spinners         
	Definitely we are looking at two spinners. Like I said we are playing with five bowlers, so most likely it will be a three-two combination.

                                                   Gujarat lift Plate title

           
	Mumbai: Gujarat notched up a thrilling one-wicket victory over Railways to lift the Ranji Trophy Plate Division trophy on Wednesday. 
    
	Needing 150 for victory with all their second innings wickets intact, Gujarat plunged to 143 for nine after being comfortably placed at 124 for four before Jay Desai (17 not out) and Sidharth Trivedi (2 not out) took them to the finish line. 
    
	Desai, dropped by Santosh Saxena off Railways captain Murali Kartik when on four, struck the winning hit  an on-driven four off the losers bowling hero Sanjay Bangar  off the last ball of the 57th over to take Gujarat past the target, half an hour after lunch. 
    
	Bangar, with fine support from Kartik, got Railways hopes up by chipping away at the Gujarat line-up at regular intervals but could not finish on the winning side despite taking six for 53 for a match haul of 11 wickets. 
    
	Niraj Patel made 27 while openers Nilesh Modi (18) and Rajesh Tabiyar (13) got into double figures in the Gujarat winning tally of 152 for nine. 
    
	Starting at 30 for no loss, Gujarat slumped to 34 for two when Bangar packed off opener Modi and skipper Parthiv Patel and then it became 51 for three when Tabiar was also dismissed by the swing bowler. 
    
	Left handed Niraj Patel went on the aggressive mode by striking six fours before edging Saxena to keeper Mahesh Rawat to bring together Parmar and Hem Joshipura. 
    
	The duo put on 46 runs for the fifth wicket to bring Gujarat to within 26 runs of the target before they lost three wickets, including two off successive balls, to be left at 131 for seven. 
    
	Gujarat took home the trophy and the winners cheque of Rs 25 lakh, presented by former BCCI chief Raj Singh Dungarpur while Railways received Rs 15 lakh and a trophy from former England batsman Raman Subba Row, here on holiday.

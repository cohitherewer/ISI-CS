	Perth: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, who is doing TV commentary, also witnessed Team Indias historic victory at the Waca. Later, he too spoke to The Telegraph. 
       
	The following are excerpts: 
       
	On his first reaction 
    
	It has been a sensational win... To be 0-2 down and then come back in such a strong manner, and at the Waca, can only be sensational... On arriving here, one had been reading that the wicket would be the fastest in years and that the bounce would unsettle the Indians... Kya hua? 
    
	On his emotions as a former captain from the subcontinent 
    
	Very happy... Bahut khush hoon... It was pleasing to see (Anil) Kumble lead from the front... This win will do plenty of good for Indian cricket... Whether its India, Pakistan or Sri Lanka, beating Australia in Australia is a terrific achievement. 
    
	On whether, after picking three seamers in the XI, he wouldve batted first 
    
	It wouldve been a tough call to make... As it turned out, Kumble made the right decision. 
    
	On the turning point at the Waca 
    
	Hmmm... I think when India totalled 330 in the first innings... 
    
	On the Sydney Test controversy 
    
	It couldve unsettled the Indian team, but it didnt... Credit, then, to the captain and the management. 
    
	On Shaun Tait having been projected as the hit man 
    
	(Laughs) Yes, Id read he would bowl at 170 kmph! They probably meant one of the bowling machines would bowl at the speed! 
    
	On what made the difference for India 
    
	One was leadership... Then, the batting had depth and your young new-ball bowlers are continuing to improve... 
    
	On the tips he gave to MoM Irfan Pathan, who idolises him, earlier in the series 
    
	That was in Sydney... He wanted to improve bowling yorkers... I told him a few things and also spoke about his grip... We talked about confidence levels too and what was pleasing is that Irfan himself wanted to do well... He had that urge and Im happy for him. 
    
	Finally, on what lies ahead, in Adelaide 
    
	The Indians should capitalise, take the momentum forward and square the series... Surely, their job isnt over.

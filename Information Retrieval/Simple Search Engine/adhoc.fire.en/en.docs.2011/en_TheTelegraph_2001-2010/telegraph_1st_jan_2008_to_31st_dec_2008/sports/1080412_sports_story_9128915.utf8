                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeevs masterly start in Augusta
                  Jeev Milkha Singh in Augusta on Thursday                     
	Augusta: Jeev Milkha Singh outscored most of his illustrious peers, including Tiger Woods, to be tied 11th after a sound opening round of one-under 71 at the US Masters.         
	The seasoned Indian pro blossomed on the par-five hole and fired four birdies to atone for the bogey treble that at one stage threatened to mar his card.         
	Close friend Daniel Chopra shot even-par 72 to be tied 19th.         
	Jeev played safe and was rewarded with birdies on the second, seventh, 13th and 15th as against the bogeys on the fourth, ninth and 14th.         
	Jeev joined a group of seven  including Paul Casey, Phil Mickelson, Mark Meara and Peter Leonard  who trail joint leaders Justin Rose and Trevor Immelman by three shots.         
	I drove the ball really well and hit it at the right places. I made a few mistakes but I think youre allowed a few on this course, Jeev said.         
	Im pretty pleased with my round. I birdied all the par fives and had a few chances. The greens are tough and you cant be too aggressive out there. I left a few short but Im happy with one under par, he said.         
	Jeev said he would not tinker with his game plan on the second day. Its the best score in five rounds for me here at Augusta national. Under par on this course is always good. Ill try to do the same tomorrow and maintain my process and routine.         
	Jeev was particularly elated with the opening hole par, where he was staring at a bogey before draining a 12-foot putt for par.         
	It was a good par. I holed a 12-foot putt so that got me going, said Jeev, who outscored playing partners, reigning British Open champion Padraig Harrington and Mike Weir by three and two shots, respectively.         
	With the course drying out after a one-hour fog delay, Jeev said he was always cautious on the devilish greens. The course was playing different from the practice rounds. The greens were quicker and firmer but wed expected that. The course is in excellent condition, said Jeev.         
	Jeev needed an invitation from the organisers to compete in this years Masters and the Indian was happy to get off to a strong start.         
	When you get invited to one of the best majors in the world, you get a jump start. I am happy to be here and I did play well after getting the invite, he said.         
	In contrast, Chopra got into a damage control exercise after a bogey-bogey start put him in a spot of bother. The Swede of Indian origin, however, remained unfazed and on his way back, birdied the 12th and 15th holes to join the likes of Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh at tied 19th.

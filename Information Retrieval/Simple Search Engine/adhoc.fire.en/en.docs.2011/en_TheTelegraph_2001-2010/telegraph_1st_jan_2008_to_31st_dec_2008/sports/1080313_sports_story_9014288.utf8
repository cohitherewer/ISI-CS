                                                   Fate hangs in the balance
                      
	Karachi: Australias postponement of their tour to Pakistan for security reasons could also put the ICC Champions Trophy, scheduled to be hosted in Pakistan this September, in jeopardy.         
	Sources admitted that unless the security situation improved dramatically in Pakistan, the organisation of the Champions Trophy could become a dream.         
	Any decision on the shifting of the Champions Trophy can only be made by the executive board of the ICC. But what is pertinent is that the board will have to review the security conditions in Pakistan in the next three months, a source said.         
	Since the Champions Trophy is a major event and requires lot of logistical details, it cant be shifted to any other country at the last moment. So in all likelihood the member countries of the ICC would review the security conditions when they meet in June for the annual board meeting, another source said.         
	If Australias apprehensions about the security situation in Pakistan dont change, the ICC could be faced with a situation where they will have to decide if the tournament can be held in Pakistan, the source said.           (PTI)

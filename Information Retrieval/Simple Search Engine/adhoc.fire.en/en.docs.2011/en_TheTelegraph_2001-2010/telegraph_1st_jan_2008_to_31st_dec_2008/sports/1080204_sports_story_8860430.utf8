                                                   Boucher wishes Gilchrist was still around

           
	 South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher, the rival with most to gain from Adam Gilchrists retirement, has said he wished the Australian had extended his career by a year. 
    
	I sent him a message to say how disappointed I was to hear that he was calling it a day because the last time I saw him I told him hed better keep his incredible career going so that we could have one last showdown at the end of the year, Boucher was quoted as saying in The Daily Telegraph, Australia, on Sunday. 
    
	South Africa are set to play Australia in three Tests here next season, then three in South Africa soon after. 
    
	Ponting worried 
    
	 Australia captain Ricky Ponting has again raked up the burnout issue, saying Shaun Taits decision to opt for a temporary retirement highlighted the mental and physical stress being piled on Australias Test players. 
    
	Obviously Taity (Tait) has been run down for a long period of time. We never saw it. 
    
	He is just the happiest bloke to have around the change room. Its hit me like a ton of bricks Were all flabbergasted, the Australia captain was quoted as saying in The Age on Sunday.

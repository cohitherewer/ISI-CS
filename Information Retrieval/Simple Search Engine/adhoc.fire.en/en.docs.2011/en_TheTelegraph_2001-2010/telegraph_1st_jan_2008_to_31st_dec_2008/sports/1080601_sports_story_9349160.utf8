                                                                                                                                                                                                     Its nice to get there: Ricky
                      
	St Johns: Ricky Ponting has become the seventh man to join the 10,000 run Test club on Friday, moving alongside Steve Waugh and Allan Border as the only Australian members of the elite group and declared himself proud of his long career.         
	Im proud of the amount of games I have played  My longevity in the game than how many runs Ive scored, he said.         
	Ive played 118 Tests now and I guess if you bat in the top order and play that many games, you are probably expected to be around the mark that I am around at the moment. I am proud of everything Ive achieved in the game but probably more proud of how many winning teams Ive played in rather than how many runs Ive scored.         
	They are the things that motivate me to keep playing, whenever I am confronted with a situation, whether it is to go and get a 100 or bat a session through, these are the things that excite me, the Australian said.

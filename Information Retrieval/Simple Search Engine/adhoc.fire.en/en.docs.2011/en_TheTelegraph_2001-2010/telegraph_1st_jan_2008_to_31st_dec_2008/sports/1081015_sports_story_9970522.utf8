The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Big Two in a thrilling draw
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Big Two in a thrilling draw
                  GM SPEAK    Pravin Thipsay                    
	The much-awaited Viswanathan Anand-Vladimir Kramnik World Chess Championship match began with a thriller that saw them settling for a draw in beautiful Bonn on Tuesday. Though rated fifth and sixth, respectively, in the latest Elo ratings, Anand and Kramnik have been regarded the best players in the world for the last five years.         
	Since the unexpected retirement of world No. 1 Garri Kasparov in 2003, the chess world has always been divided over who the best player in the world was. Anand has won the prestigious Chess Oscar as many as four times, but then Kramnik has the distinction of being the only one to have defeated the legendary Kasparov.         
	In the 2003-04 world title match, won by Kramnik, Anand was kept out of the championship cycle by Fide while the world championship won by Anand last year was not really accepted as proof of his absolute supremacy by Kramniks supporters as it was not a one-on-one match.         
	Therefore, when Fide signed a world championship match contract with Anand and Karmnik in December 2007, the chess world began to eagerly look forward to the emergence of a real champion who would take the coveted place of Kasparov.         
	The draw of lots on October 13 seemed to place Anand in a slightly better situation. In such a one-on-one match, it is often important to use your brahmastra in the last game. With Anand getting white pieces in the 12th and last game, we Indians can certainly look forward to the match optimistically.         
	Both Anand and Kramnik have been studying hard for the match for over six months and this has led to their under-performance in recent tournaments. However, on Tuesday the players began their match like true champions.         
	Kramnik opened the game with his favourite Queen Pawn opening which suits his positional style. His major victories have been in this very opening. Anands choice to counter the opening with the solid but passive Slav defence came as a surprise, particularly since he had been badly crushed by Kramnik in this opening in the World Blitz Championship last year.         
	Kramnik followed up with the exchange variation as in the previous game, but Anand varied as early as move 6, choosing the more obvious and popular path. Anands castling on the ninth move gave a dynamic twist to the game at a very early stage.         
	At this moment, Kramnik worked out a logical plan and found a new continuation on the 14th move, which apparently posed problems to Anand. At this stage, Anand thought for a long time and then sacrificed a queen side pawn to force a dynamic end game rather than defending a bad middle game passively.         
	Kramnik slowly improved his piece position and made a sharp central pawn break on the 21st move which created tense moments for Anands fans. However, with a brilliant tactical stroke on move 23, Anand made things absolutely simple and clear.         
	Kramnik was forced to deviate from his intended plan of creating a central passed pawn and had to give back his extra pawn on the 25th move. The players agreed to a draw on the 32nd move in a lifeless position.         
	Anand will have white pieces in the second game and we can look forward to a sharp battle in the Petroff defence or the Spanish game on Wednesday.       Grandmaster Pravin Thipsay will be analysing the   Anand-Kramnik showdown   exclusively for The Telegraph

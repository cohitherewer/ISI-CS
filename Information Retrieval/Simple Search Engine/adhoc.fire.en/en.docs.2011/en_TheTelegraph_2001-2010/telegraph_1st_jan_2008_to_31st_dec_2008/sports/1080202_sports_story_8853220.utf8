                                                   Second division 
 clubs to benefit from new rule

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
              
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has come out with a new rule on players loan that opens up the possibility of top stars in the current I-League also playing in the second division this season. 
    
	The I-League ends on February 23, and the second division is expected to start in March. 
    
	Article 10 of the AIFFs Players Status Rules says, a club playing first or second division of the Professional National Football League can take six players on loan, three from within the state and three from outside the state. 
    
	Though the AIFF rules specify that a player cannot be transferred on loan from a higher division to a lower division club, few second division clubs can take advantage of the new rule as their status in the state league is on a par with some of the I-League clubs. 
    
	Confirming this, a source in the AIFF said: If teams like Mohammedan Sporting or Chirag United, who are expected to play in the second division, manage to rope in Bhaichung Bhutia or Jose Ramirez Barreto from Mohun Bagan on loan, it cannot be stopped as all three teams play in the same division of the local league. 
    
	The official, however, said the teams would have to hurry as the last day for recruiting players on loan is February 28. Since the I-League is ending on February 23, second division teams willing to recruit first division players, will have to act fast. 
    
	While a few second division clubs are delighted with the opportunity to strengthen their sides, Mumbai FC official Henry Menezes is peeved. This rule shouldnt have come into place, said the former India goalkeeper. 
    
	If I-League players also play in the second division, then how would we get to watch new players, he asked.

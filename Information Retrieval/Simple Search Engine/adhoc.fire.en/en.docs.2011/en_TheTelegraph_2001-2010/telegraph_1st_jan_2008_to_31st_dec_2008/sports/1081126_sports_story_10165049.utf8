            SHASHANK SHEKHAR             Peter Thangaraj                           
	Bokaro: Legendary footballer Peter Thangaraj died of a massive heart attack early on Tuesday. Thangaraj moved to the steel city when Bokaro Steel offered him a job as sports officer and coach in the 70s. Thangaraj spoke to The Telegraph more than a week ago, possibly his last interview, while he was at the Mohan Kumar Mangalam Stadium to watch a few matches of the All India SAIL Golden Football meet.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Happy moments         
	There are many The first one came when under my captaincy, Services won the Santosh Trophy beating formidable Bengal. Being included in the India team which represented the country in the 1956 Olympics was the other momentous occasion in my life. Playing alongside P.K Banerjee, Mewalal, Balram, Chuni Goswami, Arun Ghosh made me feel on top of the world. I also have very happy memories of winning the soccer gold at the 1966 Bangkok Asian Games and winning IFA Shield for East Bengal in 1970. I played alongside Habib, Sudhir, Parimal Dey and Santo Mitra.         
	Any regrets?         
	I havent yet got the Padmashree like many of my peers like P.K. Banerjee and others, who gave me lots of love and affection. I did not get the award as no MP referred my name. Even Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told me that he felt guilty after coming to know that no one recommended my name.         
	Future of Indian soccer         
	Indian soccer has grown, but the standard of international soccer has developed much more. We will have to go miles to be at par with other countries. There are many Dhonis in football and other sports, but the government does not pay attention to sports in this state.         
	Mistakes...         
	The biggest mistake of my life was to shift to Bokaro, where initially I got some love and respect.         
	Life after retirement         
	Life has become hell for me and no one recognises me now. In the morning, I go to the grounds in Sector-V to feed crows and dogs all the while repenting my decision not to stay in Bengal.         
	Last wish         
	When I die, India should remember me as a goalkeeper who wanted to raise the standard of Indian soccer. After my death, if the people of Bengal still love me, they should convene a prayer meeting for me as I still love them and I am obliged they gave me prestige and respect. I bow my head to peers like Chuni, PK, Mewalal who had always told me not to leave Bengal.

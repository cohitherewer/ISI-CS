The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Win of no use to Vasco
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Win of no use to Vasco
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A lacklustre Vasco beat Oil India 1-0 in the ongoing 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Tuesday afternoon.         
	Vasco must thank their stars for the Ravshan Teshabaev goal that won them the match despite a below par performance.         
	Teshabaev nodded in an Agnelo Colaco corner from the right in the 70th minute of a match dominated by Subrata Bhattacharyas men from the word go.         
	They would also be grateful to custodian Lakshmikanth Kattimani for saving an Okwuelum Ezekiel penalty in the 42nd minute.         
	On the day, Oil India did everything  running, attacking, creating  and they had their chances, but Vasco, with an out-of-sorts mid-field and a weak defence, had the last laugh.         
	Starting from the early 11th minute, when a fiery Durga Boro right footer hit the post, Oil India dazzled. Minutes later, a Okwuelum Ezekiel free-kick went wide.         
	In the second half, Oil India started from where they had left off in the first.         
	With a similar spark and an equal endurance they threatened and toiled, troubling the Vasco defence time and again. But luck favoured Vasco who kept reinforcing their defence to nullify ambitious moves from Durga Boro and Ezekiel.

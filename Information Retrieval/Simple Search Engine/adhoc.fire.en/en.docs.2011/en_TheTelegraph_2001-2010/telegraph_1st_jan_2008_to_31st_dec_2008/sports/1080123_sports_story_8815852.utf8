                                                   Hayden strategy to counter swing

           
	Melbourne: Opener Matthew Hayden, the thorn in Indias flesh in the first two Tests, has his plans in place to face the swing bowling of the visiting pacers in Adelaide after they flummoxed the Australians in Perth. 
    
	Youve got to have a strategy to genuine swing bowling, particularly to that shape, which is leaving the left-hander, Hayden said. 
    
	Ill be proactive in the way I react if the ball starts to swing in Adelaide. Ill be taking an off-stump guard and Ill be definitely batting a long way out of my crease because Im not worried about pace bowlers delivering at 130kmph, the broad-shouldered opener was quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald. 
    
	If they want to bowl short I may leave myself a little bit vulnerable but I fancy my chances in Adelaide. I know where my off-stump is so I can leave the ball and if they do bowl straight I can hit them straight, which is where I want to hit. 
    
	I dont want to be cover driving with the ball moving away from me, the Queenslander said. (AGENCIES)

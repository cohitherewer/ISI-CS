                                                                                                                                                                                                     Girish Kaushik in the lead
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: Girish Kaushik of Karnataka emerged as the sole leader with 8.5 points after the completion of the 9th and penultimate round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Alekhine Chess Club on Sunday.         
	Girish, who won both his games now requires a draw in the final round to clinch the title. Five players  Satyajit Kundu, Sayantan Das, Hemant Sharma, Aditya Chakraborti and Dhee Sankar are in the joint 2 nd place with 7.5 points apiece.         
	Overnight leader, Sayantan Das of Scottish Church Collegiate School succumbed under pressure to go down rather tamely against Girish .         
	Fireworks were expected on the board in a crucial game between the two; but it turned out to be a damp squib as Sayantan played the opening passively and allowed Girishs rook and queen to penetrate his defences , after which it was curtains for him.         
	Later in the afternoon, Sayantan drew against the top seed Satyajit Kundu of Vivekananda Mission School in a hard fought battle .         
	Chandrashish Majumder of St Xaviers Collegiate School, out-manoeuvred the Asian U-10 champion Diptayan Ghosh of South Point in a long ending in the 8th round and then almost held his fort against Girish but faltered in a bishop versus knight ending .

    - Federer may face Djokovic in semi-finals                                   
	London: Sania Mirza was on Friday handed an easy first round against unseeded Colombian Catalino Castano in next weeks Wimbledon but the going would get tough for the Indian ace thereafter as she could be up against defending champion Venus Williams in as early as the third round.         
	The Indian, seeded 32nd, who has had a disappointing build-up to the grass court Grand Slam, crashing out in the second round of the two warm-up events, has an easy opening match as her opponent is ranked more than 100 places below her at 148th.         
	If Sania gets past the first hurdle, she will take on the winner of the match between German Martina Muller and Spaniard Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez.         
	Womens top seed Ana Ivanovic and two-time champion Serena Williams are in the same top half. No. 2 Jelena Jankovic and Venus are in the bottom section.         
	Venus, seeded No. 7, will open defence against British wild card entry Naomi Cavaday. If Venus gets past Sania, she will meet Daniela Hantuchova in the fourth, Jankovic in the quarters and 2004 champion Maria Sharapova in the semi-finals. The Williams sisters could meet in the final again.         
	Ivanovic faces Rossana De Los Rio of Paraguay in the first round. She could face Anna Chakvetadze in the quarter finals and either Serena or No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetzova in the semi-finals.         
	Meanwhile, mens top seed Roger Federer could face No. 3-ranked Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals as he bids for a sixth straight Wimbledon title. Djokovic, the Australian Open champion, was drawn into Federers half of the bracket Friday.         
	Second-ranked Rafael Nadal, who lost to Federer in the past two finals, is in the other half of the draw. He could face two-time runner-up Andy Roddick in the semi-finals.         
	Federer, who has won 59 straight matches on grass, will open play on Centre Court on Monday against Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia.         
	Federer could face a third-round match against Gael Monfils, whom he beat in the French Open semi-finals, and either 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt  the last man to win Wimbledon before Federer  or Fernando Gonzalez in the fourth. His projected quarter final opponent is Spains fifth-seeded David Ferrer.         
	Nadal, coming off his fourth straight French Open victory and first grass-court title at Queens Club, will open against German qualifier Andreas Beck.           (AGENCIES)

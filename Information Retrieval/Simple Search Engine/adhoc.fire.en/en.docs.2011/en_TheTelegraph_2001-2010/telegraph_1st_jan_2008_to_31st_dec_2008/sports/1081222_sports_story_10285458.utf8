The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Late strikes spoil England fightback

	Mohali: Two late strikes blighted captain Kevin Pietersens majestic century as England tried to fight their way back on the third day of the second Test at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium on Sunday.         
	Pietersen (144) did the rescue act in his own indomitable style. When he walked in the visitors were tottering at one for two but the captain responded aggressively with two crucial partnerships  102 with Alastair Cook (50) and 149 with Andrew Flintoff (62).         
	The last two overs undid all of Pietersens good work as Harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra struck vital blows to remove the current and the former England captain. At stumps, the visitors, in reply to Indias 453, were 282 for six, still 171 behind. We are in a difficult situation, Pietersen said later. There is little possibility of winning the match.         
	Had Pietersen not played the way he did, England would not have reached thus far. Following a scratchy start, the Hampshire batsman had some verbal exchanges with Yuvraj Singh. But once he settled down, Pietersens array of strokes were there for all to see. Some antics but it was not insulting. Everyone is entitled to do what they want to do, Pietersen said later.         
	So dominating was the England captain, who was instrumental in convincing his teammates to come back to India for the two-Test series after the terror attacks in Mumbai, that he completed his century in just 126 deliveries. In all, he hit 17 boundaries and one six.         
	Indian batsmen Gautam Gambhir and Rahul Dravid starred on the first two days with centuries and a second wicket partnership of 314 runs. But both the knocks paled in comparison to what Pietersen did on a sunny afternoon. It was Pietersens 15th century in 45 Tests.         
	Each and every stroke that Pietersen played had a stamp of class written all over but the best came when he was batting on 70. Playing against Harbhajan Singh, the England right-hander went for a switch hit and the ball travelled over cover for a huge six.         
	Encouraged by the success, Pietersen attempted a repeat on several occasions but it did not produce similar results barring a four off Amit Mishra. I dont consider it a risky shot, Pietersen said of the switch hit. When the leg side is packed by fielders, you need to take such shots to score. I consider it a scoring shot. That is how I did it in the one-day matches.         
	However, India had the last laugh when the scoring slowed in fading light and Pietersen was adjudged leg before off Harbhajan. Flintoff, too departed, caught by close in fielder Gautam Gambhir.         
	In the morning, India threatened to run through the England batting order with two wickets in two overs. Like in the first two days, the start was once again delayed by 90 minutes because of a thick fog and Indian pacers exploited the conditions by sending back Andrew Strauss (0) and Ian Bell (1) in quick succession.         
	Zaheer Khan trapped Strauss leg before with the third delivery of the day. In the first ball of the next over, Bell had his middle stump flying when he edged Ishant Sharma on to his wicket.         
	Pietersen took the Indian bowlers head on and guided England to 57 for two at lunch along with Alastair Cook. Like his captain, Cook too matched his partner shot by shot before he fell to Zaheer Khan for 50.

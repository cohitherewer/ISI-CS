                                                Elements may have the last laugh, feels Sunny
  - Dont make anybody champions in two days and dont pull them down in two days: Sourav       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Sydney: We could debate on the likely target for India and so on, but the elements may well have the last laugh, the iconic Sunil Gavaskar told The Telegraph at the end of a truncated fourth day at the SCG.         
	That, indeed, remained the biggest worry as even worse weather is forecast for Sunday when the curtain comes down on the second 3mobile Test.         
	Whatever the outcome, Matthew Hayden has already posted another hundred  his 29th, placing him on a par with Sir Donald Bradman.         
	Sourav Ganguly, of course, could have got his on the previous day. Hed fallen for 67.         
	Both Hayden and Sourav took questions from the media on Saturday evening  the day, by the way, saw poor umpiring (this time from Mark Benson) for the umpteenth time in the Test. Again, the Indians were at the receiving end.         
	The following are excerpts from what Sourav and Hayden said:         
	SOURAV GANGULY: Its not that were out of the Test... It still is a good wicket... Theres turn, yes, but not dangerous... One cant say that a draw is the most likely result... Lets see how the morning goes... Its an early start... I wouldnt like to comment on the umpiring decisions... Youve been watching the match... I cant say whether walking is or isnt the way forward... Id reacted on getting out yesterday (Friday) because Id been batting well, was well set and there was the opportunity for a big hundred... Brad Hogg deceived me in the air and I probably couldve played better... Hes not the worst bowler around... Hes done well in the first two Tests, but its still early days for him in Test cricket... Ricky Pontings a great player and weve been lucky to (regularly) get him early... What do I feel about Harbhajan (Singh) celebrating the way he did? Well, the good thing is that he stayed on the field! The Australians win because theyve got quality players, not only because theyre aggressive... As for Yuvraj (Singh) and (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni not getting runs, all Ill say is that dont make anybody champions in two days and dont pull them down in two days...         
	MATTHEW HAYDEN: I think theres enough time to force a win... Weve given ourselves the best chance of doing so... I dont know what the target could be... Could be 260... The bounce has gone out of the wicket and batting isnt easy... Wed desperately like to win and can make it really difficult for India... I think were in a slightly stronger position... You dont ask records to appear in front of you... Wed be going for it, not only driven by the fact that, if we do win, then well be equalling our record of 16 consecutive wins... As for our batsmen accepting the offer of light, I think Australia had much more to lose in that situation than India... Im happy that Im on a par with Sir Don... Longevity has been a part of our success and I very humbly accept the privileges offered by the game... I havent thought of dedicating this hundred to anybody... Yes, I did get out playing the reverse-sweep, a shot Id never played before... I took lots of flat white coffee to keep my concentration during the rain-forced breaks... Its for the first time that I had a runner in Tests and I had a giggle that it was my captain, Ricky Ponting... He did most of the mid-pitch talking...

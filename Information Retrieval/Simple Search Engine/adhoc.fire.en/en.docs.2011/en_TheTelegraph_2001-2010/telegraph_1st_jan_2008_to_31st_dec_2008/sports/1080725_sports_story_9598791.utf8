The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Railway FC hold EB 1-1
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Railway FC hold EB 1-1
            A STAFF REPORTER            Suraj Mondal                           
	Calcutta: East Bengals woeful run in the Sahara CFL Premier Division continued as they drew 1-1 against a spirited Railway FC on Thursday.         
	 Manoranjan Bhattacharjees side are now on five points after four matches. The handful of East Bengal fans who were present at the Salt Lake stadium, left fuming after their side displayed another lacklustre performance.         
	The red-and-gold brigadetook the lead early in the first half, when striker Parveen Kumar headed in Alvito DCunhas free-kick in the 16th minute. Railway FC goalkeeper Rakesh Prasad was slow off his mark, allowing an opportunistic Kumar to rise smartly and guide in Alvitos flighted ball from the left flank. The East Bengal midfield, instead of dominating proceedings, decided to sit back and shoot long balls for the two strikers Ashim Biswas and Parveen Kumar. East Bengal came close to doubling their lead in the 25th minute, when Alvitos 30-yard free-kick was brilliantly saved by Prasad.         
	Sourin Duttas Railway FC, playing without a single foreigner, surprised everyone when they equalised in the 32nd minute.         
	Man-of-the-Match Suraj Mondal latched on to a loose ball outside the East Bengal penalty box and outpaced Mehtab Hossain and Anupam Sarkar, before smartly placing the ball past goalkeeper Arnab Das Sarma. Mondals individual brilliance was the only high point of the half, which was otherwise marred by several fouls committed by both sides desperate to gain control of the midfield. Referee Kashinath Sen was put under a lot of pressure by the remonstrating Railway F.C. players, unhappy that East Bengal players were getting away lightly.         
	The half-time break brought no zing to East Bengals performance as the ill-tempered nature of the match continued. East Bengals Anupam Sarkar and Jayanta Sen received yellow cards within the first quarter of the second half.         
	A desperate Manoranjan Bhattacharjee was forced to bring on Edmilson Marques in place of goal-scorer Parveen Kumar, since nothing seemed to be clicking for his side.         
	Bhattacharjees gamble backfired as the Brazilian looked slow and unfit, adding nothing to an already toothless attack. The Railway defenders held their line well and won everything in the air, as East Bengal piled on the pressure by aiming long balls for their strikers to latch on to.         
	The young Railway FC right back Munna Malick caught the eye with solid defending and overlapping down the right wing.

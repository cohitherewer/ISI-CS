The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India look to wrap it up
                                                                                                                                                                                             India look to wrap it up
  - Sachin likely to open with sehwag sidebottom ruled out of series       A CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar at a practice session in Bangalore on Saturday                                 
	Bangalore: India, bolstered by the return of batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar, will look to seal the seven-match ODI series against England on Sunday when they take on the visitors in the fourth match of the series here.         
	The hosts have won three matches on the trot and need just one more win to wrap up the series.         
	England have no option but to win all the remaining matches in the series and the process has to start from Sundays day-night encounter at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.         
	The visitors were dealt a further blow when fast bowler Ryan Sidebottom was ruled out of the rest of the series due to a side strain.         
	The left-arm swing bowler underwent a further scan on his lower back to determine the extent of his injury and the reports have been sent to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), coach Peter Moores told a news conference.         
	Sidebottom missed the first two matches due to an injury he picked up at the start of the Stanford Twenty20 competition in the Caribbean islands last month and also underwent a scan for a back problem before the third match.         
	The return of Tendulkar has no doubt made the Indian batting line-up more formidable but the maestros return will force the Indian team management to tinker with the batting order.         
	Tendulkar had been rested for the first three matches of the series after playing in all the four Tests against Australia and it remains to be seen whether he will open the innings with Virender Sehwag.         
	It will be a tough decision for the Indian team management as making Tendulkar open the innings would mean tinkering with the highly successful opening pair of Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir.         
	In case Tendulkar opens, the left-handed Gambhir, who is in very good nick, may come in to bat at No. 3.         
	For Tendulkar, it will be his first one-dayer in eight months, having played his last match against Australia in Brisbane in March this year.         
	It was, though, unclear as to who will miss the bus due to Sachins return.         
	Rohit Sharma has not been in too flattering a form in this series. Suresh Raina has also failed to impress. Its almost certain, though, that either of the two will make way for Tendulkars return.         
	Irfan Pathan, who was also brought back to the team, is unlikely to feature in the playing XI with the likes of Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma and Munaf Patel in the squad.         
	The form of Yuvraj Singh, who has already cracked two centuries in the series, has been heartening for the Indians and England will have to stop him from firing if they want to take their hopes forward to Cuttack.         
	Sundays fixture is a day-night affair and the Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch promises to be a batting paradise.         
	Its a sporting wicket, which should assist the batsmen more than the bowlers. The ball will come on to the bat nicely. However, in the first session, the pitch may offer some help to the bowlers, said curator Narayan Raju.         
	However, the weather is a concern as the city experienced long spells of drizzle on Saturday under the influence of a trough of low over Southwest bay off the Tamil Nadu-Sri Lanka coast.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt.), Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma/Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Munaf Patel.         
	England (likely): Kevin Pietersen (capt.), Ian Bell, Matt Prior, Owais Shah, Paul Collingwood, Ravi Bopara, Andrew Flintoff, Samit Patel, James Anderson/Steve Harmison, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann.         
	Match starts: 2.30 pm

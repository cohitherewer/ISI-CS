The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Monika pleads innocence
                                                                                                                                                                                             Monika pleads innocence

	New Delhi: On a day of high drama, dope-tainted weightlifter Monika Devi on Wednesday pleaded innocence claiming that she was a victim of politics and later stormed into the Sports Authority of India (SAI) headquarters, where she confronted a top official demanding justice.         
	The Manipuri girl was pulled out of the Indian squad for Olympic Games last night for testing positive for an anabolic salt in a dope test conducted by the SAI on June 29.         
	At a press conference in the morning, a weeping Monika said she had no idea which dope test she flunked as she cleared four tests in the last two months. I am innocent. I have always stayed away from doping and that is why I was selected in the trials. Everyone knows there are various international tests and no sensible athlete would do that (dope).         
	I am ready to go to Beijing where my dope test is scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday). If I fail there, leave apart banning me for life, shoot me in public, she said.         
	Monika, selected ahead of Andhra weightlifter Shailaja Pujari in the Indian selection trials last month, claimed some people in the SAI were trying to make a case for Shailaja due to regional allegiance, an allegation which SAI denies.         
	An agitated Monika stormed into the SAI headquarters with Indian Wrestling Federation officials and some journalists and confronted its executive director (teams) R.K Naidu, demanding report of her dope test.         
	Meanwhile, IWF selection committee chairman B. Venkataramiah feels P. Shailaja had a chance if the IWF and the IOA could propose her name as the replacement. Shailaja has a chance but I think the IWF is in very embarrassing position at the moment, Venkataramiah said.         
	However, IWF president Harbhajan Singh said that he could not take the risk of sending the Andhra lifter, who had history of being a dope offender as it could invite a ban on the IWF again.

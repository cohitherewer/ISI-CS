The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Another 20-25 runs wouldve done the trick: Buchanan
                                                                                                                                                                                           Another 20-25 runs wouldve done the trick: Buchanan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Looking cool and composed, John Buchanan stepped in for the post-match news conference after Kolkata Knight Riders hopes of reaching the semi-finals of the Indian Premier League went up in smoke in front of a capacity crowd at the Eden on Tuesday night.         
	The Australian didnt offer any excuses for the six-wicket defeat at the hands of league leaders Rajasthan Royals but said his boys had given a good enough account of themselves.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Yousuf Pathans performance         
	He took the game away from us, didnt he...? He hit the ball very well, and is a very strong onside player. If we had got one more wicket after they were four down..., who knows?         
	Reasons for the bad fielding performance         
	I wouldnt say we sprayed the ball all around the park but we certainly failed to hit the stumps when we needed to. However, I am very happy with the way my boys performed. Remember, we were playing the so-called favourites and we didnt let them roll us over. We stuck to our task, held our own and generally gave a very good account of ourselves. Another 20-25 runs would have done the trick. But congratulations to the Rajasthan Royals.         
	Update on Shoaib Akhtar         
	Well... its the same thing really. We are taking it day by day. Hopefully we will have a medical session on Wednesday. Andrew Leipus is going to have a good look at him. I expect him to be available for selection for the match against Delhi DareDevils...         
	Reasons behind Ishant Sharmas poor performance         
	Well... I dont agree that he had a poor tournament. I think he bowled particularly well. He always came in to bowl at a very difficult time. The ball remains new and hard and owing to the restrictions on field placements the batsmen can take a few risks against him.         
	It is a very tough time to bowl for any bowler. But yes, I think more than anyone else, Ishant would himself be rather disappointed with the way he has not been among wickets. Its after all a learning curve for him. Hes coming to terms with the correct line and length in this format of the game.         
	Would we get the eight opening combination in the next match?         
	How many did we have by now...? I think its seven. I cant say really. We wil have to reassess the situ- ation.         
	Targets for the last two matches         
	Well we have a couple of good reasons to play for really... Number one is obviously pride. We want to finish it on a high note. Two, we want to give the younger guys more experience in handling tough match situations. Its also about learning to play together as a group.         
	Logic behind sending Mohammed Hafeez as an opener         
	This is his preferred position. He is most potent at that slot. Hafeez himself feels more confident opening the batting. I think he has the potential to be a good opener has well. He has all the shots. Just that the execution of those shots havent been right.

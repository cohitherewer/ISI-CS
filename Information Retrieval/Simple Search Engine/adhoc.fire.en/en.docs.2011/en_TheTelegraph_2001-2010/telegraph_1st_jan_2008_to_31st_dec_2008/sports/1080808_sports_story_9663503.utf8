The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Koreas stay apart
                                                                                                                                                                                           Koreas stay apart
                      
	Time has all but run out for the two Koreas to work out a joint march in Fridays Beijing Olympics opening ceremony, the South Korean delegation said. There has been no progress, said a South Korean spokesman on Thursday. Contacts continue but we face practical limits, he said a day before the opening ceremony at Birds Nest Stadium. The International Olympic Committees (IOC) Games executive director Gilbert Felli said on Wednesday, the IOC would wait till the last minute to accommodate Korean efforts to march together. Athletes from the two Koreas, still technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean conflict, marched together under a unity banner at Sydney in 2000 and at Athens in 2004, when bilateral relations were thawing.         
	Torch on Great Wall         
	The Olympic flame made one of its final relays on Thursday on the eve of the Olympic Games opening ceremony as torchbearers carried it along the ancient Great Wall of China. After a short ceremony at the landmark Badaling section of the heritage site, hundreds of fans waving yellow and red pompoms cheered on the first torchbearer, Li Zhonghua. If you dont go to the Great Wall, then youre not a real man, said Li. Its appropriate for a soldier to start the torch relay for the great wall leg, because the great wall is a symbol of China and a symbol of the Peoples Liberation Army, he said.         
	Family tradition         
	Ace Spanish forward Pol Amat is making his familys 20th Olympic appearance in Beijing, hoping Spains Golden Year for sport will continue as he competes in his fourth and final Games. My father played three Olympic Games. My three uncles played at three, three and four Games respectively. My cousin played three Olympic Games too, Amat said on Thursday. I dont know if it is one (the only) case in the world. It is special and a tradition in the family.         
	A touch of politics         
	The US team on Thursday chose a former refugee from the Darfur conflict to carry the flag at the Olympic opening ceremony, thus throwing the spotlight on Chinas much-criticised foreign policy in Africa. The decision to nominate Sudan-born 1500 metre track star Lopez Loming, a member of the team Darfur activist group, added a touch of political drama to Fridays ceremony. Coming just days after a visa was revoked for team Darfur co-founder Joey Cheek to visit China, the decision honours Lomongs tale of escaping the violence in Sudans region of Darfur.

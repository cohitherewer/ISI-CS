	Calcutta: Five ex-Central Bureau of Investigation officers, three retired armymen and two former cops are being trained by the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) for duty during the inaugural Indian Premier League.         
	The eight-team League, which could change the face of cricket much like Kerry Packers World Series in the late Seventies, begins on April 18. As for the ACSU, its an arm of the International Cricket Council and its No.1 priority is to thwart match-fixing.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the training began in New Delhi after the recent Motera Test and will conclude on April 16.         
	The ACSUs regional security officer, Niranjan Virk, was involved for the first couple of days. As hes now in Kanpur, for the third and final Test, one of his colleagues is going about the job alone. Virk may have another session with the group of 10 once the Test ends.         
	Significantly, the ACSUs general manager and chief investigator, Indias Ravi Sawani, will personally brief all players, officials and support staff before the opening match of every team.         
	Were going to be absolutely stringent The ACSU procedures will be followed in full, in fact possibly even more thoroughly, remarked Inderjit Singh Bindra, a governing council member of the League.         
	A former Board of Control for Cricket in India president, Bindra added that the world bodys anti-doping policy would also be enforced.         
	Meanwhile, the controversial Steve Bucknor and Darrell Hair wont be seen in action during the League, which is going to run till June 1. The most highly rated Simon Taufel wont be around either.         
	The concerned committee, one learns, has shortlisted 11 umpires from overseas. They are (alphabetically): Mark Benson, Billy Bowden, Aleem Dar, Steve Davis, Billy Doctrove, Daryl Harper, Ian Howell, Brian Jerling, Rudi Koertzen, Asad Rauf and Russell Tiffin.         
	Around six Indian umpires could also be on the Leagues roster.         
	Incidentally, (as of now) except Jawagal Srinath, nobody from the existing panel of Match Referees will be on duty.         
	The League has, however, roped in one-time Match Referees Clive Lloyd, Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Gundappa Viswanath, Alvin Kallicharan and Talat Ali. Farokh Engineer, who has been in England for decades, will also be seen in the Match Referees chair.

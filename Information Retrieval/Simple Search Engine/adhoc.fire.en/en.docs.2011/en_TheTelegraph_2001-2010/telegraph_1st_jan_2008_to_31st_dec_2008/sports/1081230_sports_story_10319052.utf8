The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting finds support
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ponting finds support
                      
	Melbourne: Former captains Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry and Mark Taylor on Monday threw their weight behind Ricky Ponting and said people need to be patient as the present Australian side goes through a difficult transition phase.         
	Benaud, Lawry and Taylor feel people should go easy on Ponting.         
	During the past 15 months, nine players have retired, three of them greats of the game, Benaud said.         
	He said Australia faced a similar crisis in 1963-64 when he, Neil Harvey, Alan Davidson and (Ken) Slasher Mackay retired together and Bob Simpson had to rebuild the side.         
	Like Benaud, Lawry also felt Ponting should be given some time. It is never easy to win in India and we lost, as usual. But immediately the critics were out for him. He is leading a transition of the Australian team, so the public needs to accept that and be patient, Lawrie said.         
	Taylor said: For years we have been talking about what will happen in the post-Warne/McGrath era. Now it has happened and, almost as if it is a shock to some people, we are struggling. Australia still could have won that Perth Test. So at least we are still competitive.

	Never have Arsenal played so well on foreign fields. Never have mighty Milan been left so distraught in their San Siro fortress. Never has Cesc Fabregas struck such a magnificent goal, a raging drive from 30 yards that knocked the crown off the titled kings of Europe. And to cap it all, Emmanuel Adebayor added a second. 2-0 in the San Siro reverberated around.         
	As the final whistle sounded on a wonderful game, Milans fans joined their Arsenal counterparts in applauding Fabregas, Adebayor and their sweat-stained company from this field of dreams.         
	Milan supporters, whose team have lifted the trophy seven times, know good European performances and Arsenals was of the highest standard, technically and tactically.         
	Make no mistake. This was no fluke. Milan were deservedly vanquished. The team of such talents as Kaka and Andrea Pirlo, of experienced campaigners like Paolo Maldini and ambitious Brazilian bucks like Pato, were outplayed and outthought by Arsene Wengers men.         
	From back to front, Wengers players were terrific, performing with style, intelligence and discipline, and proving why their manager so believes in their bright future. Gael Clichy embodied the mobility and resilience in the visitors back-four. Fabregas tackled, passed and moved cleverly and relentlessly in midfield. In attack, Alexander Hleb and particularly Adebayor caused Milans defence constant nightmares.         
	The plan had been simple: play on the counter with Hleb in the hole behind Adebayor, draw Milans sting and then unleash the teams pace against ageing legs as the game wore on.                   Arsenal rsquo;s Cesc Fabregas celebrates his goal against AC Milan on Tuesday      
	To the delight of the huge contingent of visiting fans, Arsenal began with even greater ambition, Adebayor setting up Hleb for an early chance that flew over.         
	In the elegant phrase of their manager Carlo Ancelotti, Europe is in Milans DNA. Certainly there seemed little sign of the uncertainty staining their Serie A campaign as they flooded forward. Kaka sought to direct forward operations from a deep location, looking for the runs of Pato and Filippo Inzaghi.         
	Milan almost scored after eight minutes. Fortunately for Arsenal, Manuel Almunia and Fabregas quelled a moment of real alarm when Andrea Pirlos corner clipped Adebayor and arrowed towards goal.         
	The scare survived, back came Arsenal, seizing their chance to shine in a game of passing precision and endless running. Adebayor relished the opportunity to test the mobility of Alessandro Nesta and Kakha Kaladze. Having twisted both into submission, Adebayor fed Abou Diaby, who fired over. Hope filled visiting hearts.         
	The World Player of the Year, graceful ambassador for the Beautiful Game, was beginning to find his crowd-pleasing stride. Fabregas hounded Kaka. Mathieu Flamini brought him down. The force was with those who chant Forza Milan.         
	More intrigue awaited the enthralled onlookers in the second half. Fabregas curled over a corner missed by everyone except for, of all people, Senderos. The ungainly centre-half swung out a leg, connected well enough but his shot headed straight to Kalac.         
	Then Paolo Maldini nutmegged Eboue, who almost gained spectacular revenge moments later when unmarked in front of goal. To Kalacs relief, Eboue fired wastefully wide.         
	Wenger introduced the jet-heeled Theo Walcott to stretch the game. But it was Fabregas who did the damage, stepping around Pirlo and beating Kalac from range.         
	Then Walcott crossed from the right and there was Adebayor sliding to make it 2-0. Arsenal were in dreamland, in the quarter-finals.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

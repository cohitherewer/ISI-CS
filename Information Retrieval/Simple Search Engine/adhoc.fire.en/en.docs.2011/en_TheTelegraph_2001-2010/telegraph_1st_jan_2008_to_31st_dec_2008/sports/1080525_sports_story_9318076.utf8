The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Buzz over young team for tri-series in Bangladesh
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Buzz over young team for tri-series in Bangladesh
  - Rookie Manpreet Singh Gony stands a good chance       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Will Sourav Ganguly make the Asia Cup squad?                                 
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) isnt planning to issue a directive, ahead of Fridays selection committee meeting in Mumbai, but an influential official said the selectors should pick a young Team India for the tri-series in Bangladesh.         
	The tri-series (with Pakistan being the third team) will be held from June 8-14.         
	My view is that the selectors should choose a young team The seniors need to be rested and the tri-series will give some exposure to the youngsters, the official told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Given the format of the tri-series, whoever the youngsters, they can only hope to play a maximum of three matches.         
	Incidentally, in the lead-up to the last tour of Bangladesh by Team India (exactly a year ago), the BCCI had actually directed Dilip Vengsarkar and Co. to select a young team.         
	And, so, out of the ODIs were Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. Harbhajan Singh too. Sachin and Sourav were back for the Test series, though.         
	While Sachin continues to be a part of the ODI line-up, Sourav was dropped for the tri-series in Australia --- Team Indias last engagement in limited overs cricket.         
	Its to be seen whether Sachin goes to Bangladesh, but hes bound to be there for the June 24-July 6 Asia Cup in Pakistan. Theres a chance that Sourav could make a comeback in that tournament.         
	The selectors will be picking both squads on Friday.         
	Already, theres talk that absolute rookie Manpreet Singh Gony (a mediumpacer) will get a look-in and that allrounder Yusuf Pathan (Irfans brother and a member of the World Twenty20-winning squad) stands a very good chance of making the cut for Bangladesh.         
	Like some others, both have been impact-players in the ongoing Indian Premier League.

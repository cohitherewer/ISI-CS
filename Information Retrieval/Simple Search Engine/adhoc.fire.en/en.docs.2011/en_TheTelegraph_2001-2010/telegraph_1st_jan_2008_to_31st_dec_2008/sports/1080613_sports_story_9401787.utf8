The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Turks send Swiss rolling out 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Turks send Swiss rolling out 
                      
	Basel: Turkey sent co-hosts Switzerland sliding out of Euro 2008 in the cruellest possible way on Wednesday when a stoppage-time goal from Arda Turan secured a 2-1 victory in an enthralling group A match (as briefly reported in Thursdays Late City edition).         
	The Swiss fans were just about to applaud a draw that would have kept their team in contention when Arda curled in the winner.         
	The victory was a measure of revenge for the Turks because the last time they met Switzerland, in a World Cup qualifying play-off in 2005 in Istanbul, the Swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl.         
	Its a wonderful feeling, said Turkey coach Fatih Terim. The players need it for their confidence and I congratulate them.         
	Switzerland coach Koebi Kuhn said: Its a very, very big disappointment. You hope for so much and go all out. But at the end of the day its not enough. Thats football.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rain deals blow to Lanka hopes 
                                                   Rain deals blow to Lanka hopes 
                      
	Melbourne: Sri Lankas survival in the tri-series hung by a slender thread after they lost to world champions Australia by 24 runs in a rain-curtailed encounter Friday.         
	Chasing Australias modest 185, the islanders were 77 for four in 29.3 overs when rain forced a premature end to the proceedings with Sri Lanka well behind under the Duckworth-Lewis method.         
	The two on-field umpires, Simon Taufel and Rudi Koertzen, waited for the rain to stop till the cut-off of 10.20 pm local time before calling off play.         
	The result of the rain-affected game dealt a huge blow to Sri Lankas quest for a berth in the best-of-three finals as they now need to win their remaining two matches to have a chance. They would also need India to lose to Australia in Sydney on Sunday.         
	With this victory, Australia confirmed their place in the finals and maintained their position atop the points table with 22 points from six games. India are second with 12 points from the same number of matches while Sri Lanka are at the bottom with six.

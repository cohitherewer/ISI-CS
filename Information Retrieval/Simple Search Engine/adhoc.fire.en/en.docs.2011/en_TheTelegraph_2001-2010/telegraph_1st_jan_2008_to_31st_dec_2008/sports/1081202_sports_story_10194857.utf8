The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mary Kom: Missing award hurts
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mary Kom: Missing award hurts
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            M.C. Mary Kom                           
	New Delhi: When Manipur boxer M.C. Mary Kom boarded the flight to Ningbo City to take part in the fifth World Womens Boxing Championships, not many expected her to retain the gold medal for the fourth consecutive time.         
	Yet, the pint-sized 46kg boxer, who returned to the capital on Monday, bagged the top honour with a comprehensive 7-1 verdict over Romania s Steluta Duta.         
	Since I was out of boxing for two years, many people thought I wont be able to repeat my performance again in the rings, said the 26-year-old, the mother of two.         
	But I was confident that I will be able to make it, said the inspector with the Manipur police.         
	In the final, I was pitted against the Romanian boxer whom I had beaten in the final in Delhi last time. I knew if I stay cool, I will be able to win again. Thats exactly what I did.         
	Mary Kom is sad that despite her tremendous success at the world level, she has not received any recognition from the government.         
	Women boxers in India should be treated with more respect. They have been bringing laurels for the country regularly, said the worlds most successful woman pugilist.         
	I was extremely pained when I was denied the Khel Ratna Award, she said.         
	I had three world titles under my belt but the selection panel did not find me good enough to get the award.         
	I was very upset because the panel had some eminent sportspersons, including the legendary Milkha Singh. At least they should have realised my contribution. It happened to me twice, the boxer said with regret.         
	Mary Kom said despite being ignored time and again, she was not going to call it quits so easily.         
	I hope they include womens boxing in the Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games, she said. People will then know how I bring honours for the nation.         
	I am sure my greatest moment will be when I will be able to represent the country in the London Olympics in 2012. I am waiting for that day, she said.         
	It is not easy to pursue the sport when you have two kids back home waiting for their mother. But fortunately, I have a very caring husband, who takes care of my sons.         
	Both of us see to it that the family life is not disturbed, said the champion boxer.

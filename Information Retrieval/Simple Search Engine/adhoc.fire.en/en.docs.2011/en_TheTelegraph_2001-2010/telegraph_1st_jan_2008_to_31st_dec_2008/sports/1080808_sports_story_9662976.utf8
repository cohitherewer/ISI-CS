  - Anderson, Harmison run through visitors rsquo; batting
                              
	London: Recalled England fast bowler Steve Harmison took two wickets in two balls and James Anderson captured three to help dismiss South Africa for 194 on Kevin Pietersens first outing as Test captain on Thursday.         
	At the close of the first day of the fourth and final Test England were 49 for one after South Africa replied to Englands aggressive bowling by capturing the wicket of Andrew Strauss for six.         
	Pietersen, whose side have already lost the series, will have enjoyed the pace and swing his bowlers found on a largely overcast day at The Oval.         
	All made contributions with spinner Monty Panesar, who delivered only 2.5 overs adding two wickets for four runs and Stuart Broad, expensive early on, also taking two in the South African tail. Andrew Flintoff claimed the first wicket of the day by dismissing Neil McKenzie before lunch.         
	Harmison dismissed captain Graeme Smith (46) and Hashim Amla (36) in the 32nd over of the day before Anderson, swinging the ball late, dismissed Jacques Kallis lbw for two.         
	The wickets were a welcome boost for South African-born Pietersen.

                                          CSA severs ties with Zimbabwe  Durban: Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Monday suspended its bi-lateral links with Zimbabwe following its players rsquo; refusal to play against the neighbouring side due to the deteriorating social environment there. CSA president Norman Arendse and ICC president Ray Mali, among other senior officials, had adopted a policy of unwavering support for Zimbabwe Cricket but last week South African players made clear their unwillingness to play against Zimbabwe.  ldquo;In the light of the worsening situation in Zimbabwe, CSA has reviewed its position in relation to Zimbabwe Cricket, rdquo; Arendse said on Monday.

Hayden rsquo;s view  Melbourne: Australian opener Matthew Hayden on Monday made it clear that country comes foremost for him and he would give preference to national commitment ahead of the cash rich Indian Premier League (IPL). ldquo;The rule is simple on this one. If we are playing for Australia in any form our decision will be to honour that commitment first. There are no grey areas here, rdquo; Hayden said as was quoted saying in an Australian daily.  Bhajji called  Mumbai: Harbhajan Singh, who is serving a five-match ODI ban for slapping Sreesanth during the IPL, is amongst nine players who have been called for a six-day camp starting at Bangalore on Tuesday. ldquo;Nine Test players have been called for a fitness specific camp at the Bangalore from Tuesday, rdquo; said BCCI rsquo;s cricket operations manager Suru Nayak on Monday.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arsenal win in style vs Wigan
                      
	London: Arsenals talented youngsters progressed stylishly to the League Cup quarter finals by beating Wigan Athletic 3-0 on Tuesday.         
	Arsene Wengers side, who thrashed Sheffield United 6-0 in the previous round and showed 11 changes from the team that beat Manchester United on Saturday, advanced with two goals by Jay Simpson and one from Carlos Vela at the Emirates Stadium.         
	I said it after Sheffield United that this is the most complete team of youngsters we have had, Wenger said.         
	Simpson, one of eight teenagers to start, latched on to a fine pass from 16-year-old midfielder Jack Wilshere to open the scoring just before halftime before grabbing his second in the 66th minute.         
	Nineteen-year-old Mexico striker Vela, who also notched a hat-trick against Sheffield United, exquisitely chipped keeper Chris Kirkland for the third goal after 70 minutes.         
	Wenger later told reporters that Czech Republic midfielder Tomas Rosicky had undergone further knee surgery but should be fit to return for Arsenal in six to eight weeks. Rosicky, 28, has been out since January.         
	Elsewhere, Glenn Whelan and Danny Pugh netted as Premier League Stoke City beat League Two (fourth division) strugglers Rotherham United 2-0.         
	Watford overcame Championship rivals Swansea City 1-0 while Championship side Derby County edged League One Leeds United 2-1.           (REUTERS)

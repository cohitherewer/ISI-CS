                                                    Steve Waugh ready to mediate if needed

	Calcutta: Steve Waugh, one of crickets most revered figures, is willing to help rebuild the bridges between Australia and India if his services are required. 
    
	The iconic former Australia captain, an immensely respected man in India, could now be Cricket Australias (CAs) best hope to quickly negotiate the issues which have tested relations between the sports superpowers. 
    
	If they needed that, I would do it, Waugh was quoted as saying in The Sydney Morning Herald. 
    
	I really dont think it is at that stage, but if it was seen as something that had to be done, yeah, I would do it. I have already spoken to some players from both sides, and I really dont think there is a need (to mediate). 
    
	The second Test at Sydney was plagued by bitter events, the reporting of spin bowler Harbhajan Singh for a monkey slur at Andrew Symonds the most dramatic. 
    
	Australian spinner Brad Hogg is expected to face an ICC disciplinary hearing in Perth charged with making an offensive remark to Anil Kumble and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 
    
	The former Australia captain was adamant that the ill feeling could be smoothed over. Anything in sport can be sorted out, Waugh said. It may be nothing more than a few players putting their personal opinions aside and being committed to going forward. 
    
	Indian team spokesman MV Sridhar said Steves willingness to help broker peace had great appeal. 
    
	The standard of Steve in the game is well known to everyone in cricket, he said. This is a kind gesture on his behalf. 
    
	We are very eager for there to be no harm to the relations between the Australian and Indian teams. 
    
	I think everybody would like to see the right outcome to the present situation. 
    
	Australian captain Ricky Ponting, however, told another newspaper on Friday night that he did not want to comment on inviting Steve to act as peacemaker. 
    
	Sorry mate, I dont want to buy into that at this time, Ponting said. 
    
	Simon Katich, meanwhile, said that with a gentlemens agreement in place well before the series, Ponting and his teammates should not have stood their ground in Sydney despite being out. 
    
	Katich said though he does not prefer such an agreement, the Australians should have been honest enough to walk after the mutual decision by Ponting and Kumble to go by the fielders word in close calls. 
    
	I think when you state how you want to play the game, in terms of claiming catches in the field, taking someones word, then youve got to be careful not to hold your ground when you know youre out, Katich was quoted as saying in The Sydney Morning Herald. 
    
	The 32-year-old New South Wales captain said there was difference of attitude between Australians and cricketers of other countries on whether to walk or not and said the hugely competitive environment Down Under could be the reason why the Australians dont walk.

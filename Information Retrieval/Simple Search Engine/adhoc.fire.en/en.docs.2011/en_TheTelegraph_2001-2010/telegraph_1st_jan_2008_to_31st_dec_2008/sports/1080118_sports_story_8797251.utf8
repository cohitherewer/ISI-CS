	Perth: The MRI scan on Yuvraj Singhs left knee has, thankfully, not shown any damage. 
    
	Ive just bruised myself and should be back in action in a week or so, Yuvraj told The Telegraph on Thursday evening. 
    
	Yuvraj, who got dropped in the ongoing Test, twisted his knee during the Team India training session in the morning. 
    
	The same knee, it may be recalled, had been injured rather badly during a game of kho-kho in the lead-up to a Champions Trophy match in October 2006. 
    
	That injury made Yuvraj miss months of international cricket, including the tour of South Africa. 
    
	Meanwhile, former captain Sourav Ganguly was also taken to hospital  not for an injury, but for a chest x-ray. 
    
	Nothing showed up, Sourav, who hasnt been keeping well for quite some time, pointed out.

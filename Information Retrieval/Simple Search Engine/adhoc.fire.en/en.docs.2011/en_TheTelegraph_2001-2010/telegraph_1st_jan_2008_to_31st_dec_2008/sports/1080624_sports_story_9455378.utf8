The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Im fit to bowl again, claims Malik
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Im fit to bowl again, claims Malik
                      
	Karachi: Having recovered from his sore shoulder, Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik on Monday said he would be bowling in the Asia Cup beginning on Tuesday to add strength and variety to his side.         
	I had not been bowling that much in last few months because of a sore shoulder. But now I am fit again and will bowl in the tournament, Malik said.         
	It will give us more options in the bowling which is so important when you play against teams like India and Sri Lanka on sub-continental pitches with their strong batting, he said ahead of Pakistans first match of the Asia Cup against Hong Kong here on Tuesday.         
	Defending the selection of two specialist spinners in the team, Malik said: In sub continental conditions you need to have at least one specialist spinner to give variety that is why we have opted for Ajmal and Mansoor. Ajmal has been in good form in domestic cricket and he is a new bowler for the other teams.         
	The Pakistani selectors have included uncapped 30-year-old off-break bowler Saeed Ajmal and young leg-spinner Mansoor Amjad in their line-up while allrounders Shahid Afridi and Fawad Alam can also bowl spin.         
	Malik was also happy that Afridi, who was carrying a wrist injury, had also recovered and would be a key player in the tournament. (PTI)

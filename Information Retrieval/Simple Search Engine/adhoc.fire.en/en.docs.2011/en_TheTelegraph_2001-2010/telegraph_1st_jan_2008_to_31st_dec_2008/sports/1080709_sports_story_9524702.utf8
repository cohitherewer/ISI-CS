The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its great to be back, says Parthiv
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Its great to be back, says Parthiv
                      
	Ahmedabad: It is a dream come true for city lad Parthiv Patel, who was on Tuesday included in the 16-member squad for the three-Test series in Sri Lanka, after being out of the national team for the last two years.         
	Wicketkeeper Parthiv was last selected for the Indian squad in January 2006 for the Pakistan tour. However, he never got a chance to play during the entire series. The Gujarat Ranji team skipper last played a Test match in October 2004 against Australia in Nagpur.         
	Its great to be back in the team, said the 23-year-old wicketkeeper.         
	Though I was preparing myself for the emerging players tournament to be held later this month in Australia, somewhere in the back of my mind I was hoping to get into the national team for the India-Sri Lanka Test series. Its great to be back in the team.         
	The left-hander, who had a brilliant domestic season last year and performed well in the recently held Indian Premier League, is eagerly looking forward to the challenge.         
	Parthiv is hopeful that he will play a Test against Sri Lanka and will not have to sit in the dressing room. (PTI)

                                                   Anand loses 
                      
	Nice: World champion Viswanathan Anand suffered a defeat at the hands of Alexander Morozevich of Russia in the blindfold game of the fifth round in Amber Blindfold and Rapid Chess.         
	Anand, who lost his last round rapid game against Peter Leko of Hungary, suffered his second defeat on the trot and remained on 4.5 points out of a possible 9 in the combined standings after a rocking start that saw him in sole lead after round 3.         
	For the record, this was Anands third straight loss against Morozevich in a blindfold game since 2006. The Indian star had also lost to the Russian in 2007 and 2006 in the same event when it was held in Monaco. The event is being played on a round robin basis between 12 players and in each round there is one blindfold and one rapid game.

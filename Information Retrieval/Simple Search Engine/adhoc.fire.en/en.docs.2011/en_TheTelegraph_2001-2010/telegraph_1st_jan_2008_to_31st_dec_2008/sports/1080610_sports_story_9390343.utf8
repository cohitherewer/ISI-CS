The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB to toughen doping rules
                                                                                                                                                                                           CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	 PCB to toughen doping rules  
	Karachi: The Mohammed Asif drug scandal may force the PCB to toughen its anti-doping regulations to include punishment for the use of recreational drugs. The PCB and even the ICC have started reviewing their anti-doping regulations and code of conduct to confirm what scenario they could possibly face once Asif is released by the Dubai police. The issue here is while the PCB anti-doping regulations clearly cover the use of banned performance enhancing drugs. But in many ways their regulations remain silent on what happens if a player is found using recreational drugs even in small quantity specially if he is not on national duty, a PCB source said.  
	Gibbs plan         
	 London: Miffed at being ignored for the Test series against England, South African opener Herschelle Gibbs has hinted that he may retire from international cricket. The 34-year-old was left out of the Test side and he says he does not harbour hopes of making the cut for the ODI team either, leaving him with little choice but to think about quitting the game. Ive got some decisions to make in the next few weeks whether to carry on at international level. Im not in the squad and Im not sure if Ill get back into the one-day team either, Gibbs said.         
	English bonus         
	 Nottingham: Englands Test players have seen their win bonuses increased to 2 million a year as cricket chiefs react to the cash bonanza caused by the growth of Twenty20. This represents an impressive three-fold increase on what they could have earned had they won every Test series last year. Administrators are worried by the potential for a rift caused by a difference in earnings between one-day players and test specialists.         
	Langer award         
	 Perth: Former Australia opener Justin Langer, has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia. Langer, 37 and Matthew Hayden formed one of the most formidable opening partnerships in cricket, combining for 14 century stands at the top of the order. Langer, who retired last year played 105 Tests, said: Its a great honour. Ive lived such a privileged lifestyle.

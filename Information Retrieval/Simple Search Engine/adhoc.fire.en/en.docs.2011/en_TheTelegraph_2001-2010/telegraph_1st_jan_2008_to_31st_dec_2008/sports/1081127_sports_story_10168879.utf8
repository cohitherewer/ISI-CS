            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal pacer Shib Shankar Paul has been kept out of the 14-member Bengal squad for the ensuing Ranji Trophy match against Tripura at the Eden from Saturday.         
	According to a selector, Paul is still not fit for a four-day match. Sreevats Goswami has been dropped.         
	The physios report has clearly mentioned that he (Paul) is still not fit for a four-dayer. So we cant risk Bengals chances by including him, a senior member of the selection committee said.         
	The Squad: Rohan Banerjee, Anustup Majumdar, Arindam Ghosh, Manoj Tiwary, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Avik Chowdhury, Ritam Kundu, Soham Ghosh, Ashok Dinda, Sourav Sarkar, Ranadeb Bose, Iresh Saxena, Dibyendu Chakraborty.

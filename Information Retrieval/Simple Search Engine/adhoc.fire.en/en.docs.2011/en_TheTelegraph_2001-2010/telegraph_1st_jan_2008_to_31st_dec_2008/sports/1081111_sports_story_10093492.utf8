The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CA set to haul up Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     CA set to haul up Ponting
                      
	Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) will seek an explanation from captain Ricky Ponting for using part-time bowlers and letting go the initiative on Day IV of the final Test against India in Nagpur, just to escape a ban for slow over-rate.         
	In a bid to speed up the over-rate, Ponting rested his regular bowlers in Sundays final session of play and thereby allowed India to claw back in their second innings after they were struggling at 166 for six at one stage.         
	I havent had a chance to talk to Ricky today about what went on during the tea-break and what the messages were that came from the umpires, CA chief executive James Sutherland said.         
	But clearly he and Tim Nielsen would have made whatever judgements they thought were most appropriate in the circumstances. Until Ive really had a chance to explore that further, its difficult for me to comment...         
	To understand exactly what were the circumstances that were involved, what they were facing, what the situation was in terms of how many overs down they were.           (PTI)

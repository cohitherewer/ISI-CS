The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger pulls up Williams sisters
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Roger pulls up Williams sisters
                  Roger Federer                     
	London: World No. 1 Roger Federer told the Williams sisters to stop moaning over the Wimbledon schedule.         
	Both four-time champion Venus and Serena, a double winner, played their fourth round matches on court two, the so-called graveyard of the seeds while mens champion Federer and second seed Rafael Nadal played on centre court and court one respectively.         
	The thing is Pete (Sampras) played on court 2 after winning seven times. Who deserves what here?, said Federer.         
	Its the club who decides in the end. Were happy to be playing here. They can put us at Aorangi (the practice courts) or Roehampton (where the qualifiers are held) if they want to, but we have to accept the fact.         
	Five-time champion Federer, who eased into the quarter finals with a straight sets win over Lleyton Hewitt, said he would have no problems if he was scheduled to play on court two.         
	I wouldnt be disappointed if they put me there. More just like, why can I not play on centre court or court 1 because theyre such nice courts? again, going back on court 2, sometimes its kind of cool. Youre closer to the crowds. Its kind of a different feeling out there.         
	I hope that day will not come for me, that I will have to play on court 2. I understand theres a little bit of disappointment but I dont think it has anything to do with disrespect. I dont think thats what this tournament is all about.         
	The American sisters both emerged unscathed from their trip to the court.         
	Serena, who eased past compatriot Bethanie Mattek 6-3, 6-3, said the snub had been particularly hard on her sister, the defending champion.         
	I do think it is weird, especially for the defending female champion who has won the tournament four times, she said, before adding sarcastically: I have only won twice  but hey, that is not so bad.         
	Venus moved a step closer to her fifth title by beating fast-rising Russian teenager Alisa Kleybanova 6-4, 6-3, setting up a quarter final meeting with Thailands Tamarine Tanasugarn.         
	Afterwards she made it clear she had been surprised with the location for her match.           (AFP)

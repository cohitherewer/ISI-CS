	Valdosta: A couple of bogeys in the front-nine denied Arjun Atwal a top-10 finish and the Indian signed off tied 16th after carding a one-under 71 in the final round of the $ 625,000 South Georgia Classic Golf Tournament on the nationwide tour here.         
	Atwal chalked up a total of three-under 285 at the Kinderlou Forest Golf Club.         
	The Orlando-based golfer made a fine start, picking up birdies on the second and fifth holes but was undone by bogeys on the sixth and ninth. Making the turn even-par, Atwal gained a stroke on the 11th and parred the remaining holes to complete another solid show on the nationwide tour after finishing tied fourth in last weeks Henrico county open.         
	The seasoned pro is aiming to earn back his PGA Tour card which he lost last year after a dismal season.         
	Meanwhile, Canadian Bryan Decorso won the title by four strokes after carding a 69 in the final round to finish with a total of 14-under 274. (PTI)

  - The former India captain speaks on Sourav         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Ravi Shastri                                 
	Nagpur: Former India captain and cricket manager Ravi Shastri spoke to The Telegraph on Sourav Ganguly and the other three who complete the Fab Four. The interview was done during breaks in Shastris TV commitments on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Had you been in the position Sourav is in today, would you have been tempted to take back your retirement?         
	A Look, announcements on retirements are made after much thought... Sourav had decided this would be his last series and gave himself the chance to go out on a high... The temptation could be there, more so after scoring so many runs (324 in seven innings at an average of 64.80), but the decision wouldve been made after much thought... Unless circumstances were such that theres a void in the India line-up, I wouldnt have reviewed my decision and my advice to Sourav is that he shouldnt.         
	Could there be a temptation on the part of the Board to get Sourav to take back his retirement?         
	Dont think so... The Board has already given Sourav a send-off and if something was on the minds of the officials, they wouldve told him yesterday (before the Big Fours felicitation)... Sourav is going out on a high... He has got big runs and India should win the series... Having announced retirement, he should leave... Anil Kumble made the right decision, Sourav made the super right decision...         
	Were you tempted to take back your retirement?         
	Never... I couldnt, because of my knee problem... It couldve been different had I been fit and doing well... (Adds laughing) But, then, I wouldnt have retired in the first place.         
	Calling it a day isnt easy, is it?         
	Its the toughest decision because the sport has been your life... For somebody who has played for 12-13 years, the sport couldve been his life for around 20 years if you include the years spent in trying to get a break... Theres bound to be some sadness, but one has to move on.         
	Souravs first India captain, Mohammed Azharuddin, feels that he still has something to offer...         
	Anybody would say that after seeing him bat in this series, but Souravs made his decision.         
	How do you look back on Souravs career?         
	Hes been our finest left-hander Souravs timing on the off has been special and there was a five-year period, from around 1997, that he matched Sachin shot for shot in limited overs cricket... As captain, Id say hes been our finest in the last couple of decades and one of the finest of all time.         
	Did Sourav under-achieve in Tests?         
	Possibly, but hed been captain for a number of years and there were responsibilities... There had been some issues too... Overall, in my view, Sourav should be very satisfied and have no regrets. Of course, theres disappointment that he couldnt get a hundred today... Having batted so beautifully, hed been set for one... I was at Lords in 1996 when Sourav got a hundred, the finest Ive seen on somebodys debut, and had been looking forward to one in his last Test too.                     
	The latter part of 2005 was very tough on Sourav. But did he himself, perhaps, lose a bit of focus?         
	Sourav too is human... Somebody making tall statements wont be remembered, somebody having the determination to make a comeback will be... Sourav proved hes a fighter... There could be oppositions who hate his guts, there could be bowlers who get frustrated and there could be officials who get upset with him... At the end of the day, though, youve got to hand it to Sourav... Actually, he hasnt just been a fighter, but a survivor.         
	What were your emotions on Thursday morning, when the Fab Fours final Test got under way?         
	It was a special day... Individuals will come and go, but the game will remain... One has felt nostalgic, yes, but the next match will be a fresh one and, who knows, there could be a new hero.         
	Is age in sport too much of an issue in India?         
	It shouldnt be... Performance should count... Till recently, did anybody talk about Kumble being in his 38th year or that he would turn 38 midway during this series? No, because hed been among the wickets.         
	When did Sourav first make an impression on you?         
	When he scripted an excellent innings in a limited overs match against the Tatas, the team Id been leading, at the CCI... That was in the late 1980s... I cant remember the team hed turned out for... I also recall a very good hundred from him for East in the Duleep Trophy... Thats when I recommended (to Milind Rege) that he be employed by the Tatas so that he could play for us.         
	Finally, your message to Sourav...         
	Enjoy the retirement... Sourav should be happy that hes leaving on such a high and that hes leaving a proud man. There are areas where he could contribute and remain involved with the game.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shah puts onus on seniors
                      
	Mumbai: The BCCI secretary, Niranjan Shah, on Wednesday put the onus on the senior cricketers to inform the board or the selection committee about their retirement plans to enable a smooth transition in the Indian team.         
	The senior players, who can be phased out in two or three years, should make their own (retirement) plans and inform the BCCI or selection committee. Like Rahul (Dravid) had done when quitting India captaincy. Like Anil (Kumble) did when retiring from ODIs, Shah said.         
	Theres been a debate among fans about the future of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and V. V. S. Laxman as well as Test captain Anil Kumble following their poor display in Sri Lanka. Shah said it was not practical in India for the selectors to ask a player about his retirement plans.         
	Its not possible in India for the selectors to ask players about their retirement plans which may lead to arguments, he said.         
	Shah also revealed that the BCCIs working committee has been authorised by the revamped constitution to review how effectively the new system of paid and appointed selectors is functioning.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chinese admit to fake glory
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Parts of the spectacular Beijing Olympics opening ceremony on Friday were faked, it has emerged. As the ceremony got under way with a drummed countdown, viewers watching at home and on giant screens inside the Birds Nest National Stadium watched as a series of giant footprints outlined in fireworks processed above the city from Tiananmen Square.         
	What they did not realise was that they were watching computer graphics. The fireworks were there for real, outside the stadium. But those responsible for filming the extravaganza decided in advance that it would be impossible to capture all 29 footprints from the air.         
	The trick was revealed in a Chinese paper at the weekend. Gao Xiaolong, head of the ceremony visual effects team, said it had taken almost a year to create the 55-second sequence.

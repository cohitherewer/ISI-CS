The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Majid slams Pak board
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Majid slams Pak board
                      
	Lahore: Former captain and chief executive Majid Khan has slammed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for financial irregularities and gross indiscipline in the team.         
	How can you appoint someone like Shoaib Malik as captain when he has admitted publicly to fixing a domestic Twenty20 game for Sialkot two years ago. He is liable to be banned under ICC match-fixing laws and yet he is the captain, Majid said at a press conference.         
	Majid was referring to the Sialkot versus Karachi match which Malik admitted to have lost deliberately to pave the way for Lahores exit in the tournament.         
	Majid said due to incompetence of administrators and their weak cricketing background, players were ruling the roost and getting away with all sorts of indiscipline.         
	In the Mohammed Asif detention case the PCB clearly has tried to rescue and save him which is unfortunate as it sets the wrong precedent for the future of Pakistan cricket, Majid added. Majid also called for the public accounts committee of the national assembly to audit the accounts of the PCB.         
	Majid said there were financial irregularities in the PCB and money was being spent without any accountability or necessity.           (AGENCIES)

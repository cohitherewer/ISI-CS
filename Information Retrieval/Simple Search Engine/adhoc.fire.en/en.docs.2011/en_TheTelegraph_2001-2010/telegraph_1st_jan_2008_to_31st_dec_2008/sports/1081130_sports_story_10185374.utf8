The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians slip to tied 20th 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indians slip to tied 20th 
                      
	Shenzhen: Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa put up an improved show in the four-ball format, returning a two-under 70 but that could not prevent the Indian duo from slipping nine places to tied 20th after the penultimate round of the Omega Mission Hills Golf World Cup here on Saturday.         
	The Indians have a three-round total of seven-under 209.         
	On a roller-coaster day, the duo managed five birdies against three bogeys. Making a fine start, the Indians picked up a birdie-brace on the third and fourth hole to make the turn two-under after playing out a flawless front nine.         
	Things went topsy-turvy in the back-nine as Jeev and Randhawa started off on a bogey-birdie note on the 11th and 12th. They picked another couple of birdies but dropped an equal number of bogeys in the remaining holes to close out an eventful day.         
	Spains Miguel Angel Jimenez and Pablo Larrazabal watched a four-shot lead disappear as Australia carded a nine-under-par 63 to share top place.         
	The Spaniards, who had a brilliant 63 in Fridays foursomes, carded a respectable 67 but Richard Green and Brendan Jones reined them in and caught them on 22-under with the latters birdie at the 18th.         
	 quot;It was a good, solid performance, quot; said the 37-year-old Green, who combined with Jones for an eagle, eight birdies and a single bogey.         
	 quot;We both played pretty well. I always knew that we could catch that up ... were very confident. quot;         
	The turning point of the day came when Jones fired a beautiful nine iron onto the 15th green and sank a six-foot putt for an eagle, while the Spaniards bogeyed it for the second day in a row.         
	Robert Karlsson and Henrik Stenson of Sweden shot a solid 66 to move up to third, four shots behind the leaders, with Germanys Martin Kaymer and Alex Cejka fourth on 17-under after a 68. Ireland are fifth a further shot back.         
	The format returns to foursomes, where players take alternate shots, for the climax of the $5.5m tournament on Sunday. (Agencies)

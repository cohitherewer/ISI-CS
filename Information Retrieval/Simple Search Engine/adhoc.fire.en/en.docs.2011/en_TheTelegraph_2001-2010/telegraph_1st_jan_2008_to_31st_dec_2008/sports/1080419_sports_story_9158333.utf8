The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Actually, reward wasnt from Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Actually, reward wasnt from Dhoni
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                           
	Bangalore: Much was made of the Rs 10,000 reportedly gifted by stand-in Test captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to the Green Park curator, Shiv Kumar, but the fact is Dhoni gave no such baksheesh.         
	The team, as a practice, offers something to the curator after every match and that wouldve been done in Kanpur too... At no time did Dhoni gift anybody anything there, a member of the team management told The Telegraph.         
	Team India won the (third and final) Test by eight wickets, a result which ensured that South Africa didnt win the series.         
	The wicket, of course, neither impressed the visitors nor Match Referee Roshan Mahanama, but the Indian team has a very different take.         
	Whats wrong in preparing a turning track? Yes, it was up-and-down and challenging for the batsmen, but whats wrong with that? We dont complain if we get bouncy wickets overseas, remarked a senior.         
	The captaincy, it may be recalled, went to Dhoni owing to Anil Kumbles unavailability.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Till a few years ago, Jo Paul Ancheri was one of Calcutta footballs biggest stars. But next week, the 34-year-old former India captain will be seen in a new role when he arrives in Kalyani to take up his first coaching job with a bunch of under-16 boys.         
	Ancheri, who has successfully completed his AFC C License course recently, has been entrusted with the job of selecting 16 youngsters for a training-cum-exposure tour of Brazil in July. The tour is a part of soft drinks giant Coca Colas talent hunt programme.         
	Speaking from Thrissur, the former winger turned central midfielder said: I am feeling excited to go to Bengal again. I spent some of my best days with Mohun Bagan there. Though I have taken up the coaching job, I think I still have a couple of years of good football left in me.         
	A total of 25 boys selected from all over the country will assemble at Kalyani for a coaching camp from June 26. We are supposed to take 16 boys to Brazil for the one-week exposure trip, Ancheri said.

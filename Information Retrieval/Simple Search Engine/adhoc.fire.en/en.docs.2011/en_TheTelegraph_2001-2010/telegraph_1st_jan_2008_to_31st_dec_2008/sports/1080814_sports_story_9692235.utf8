The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Losing Sachin can prove to be crucial: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Losing Sachin can prove to be crucial: Dhoni
    - ODI captain hopes youngsters would make a difference in the series             A CORRESPONDENT            Mahela Jayawardene and Mahendra Singh Dhoni after a news conference   in Colombo on Wednesday. (AP)                                       
	Colombo: Team India ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Wednesday said that it was difficult to fill in the shoes of batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar, who was ruled out of the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka due to an injury         
	.         
	The following are excerpts:         
	On Sachin Tendulkars absence         
	Its difficult to fill the space left by Sachin Tendulkar. Its not just his contribution with bat and ball. He comes up with brilliant suggestions on the field. The impact he has on the dressing room is great. But cricket goes on. When this scenario has happened in Indian cricket, somebody has accepted responsibility. Its one of the toughest places to play cricket, you dont get loads of runs when batting, you have to work hard. It (Sachins absence) can be crucial.         
	On the sides performances in the subcontinent         
	We havent been doing too badly. We lost crucial games, the final in Bangladesh, the Asia Cup final, so it may seem that way but the team has been consistent both in the subcontinent and outside.         
	His absence in the Test series         
	Physically, I was always ready, but I wasnt a 100 per cent in practice, which sends a bad message to the rest of the side. If I would have continued, I might have been injured, prevention is better than cure they say. Physically I am more conditioned. I was off cricket.         
	Keeping wickets in Sri Lanka         
	Personally I feel Sri Lanka is one of the toughest places to keep wickets. I remember coming here (in 2005) and not having a great time, so I wouldnt blame Dinesh (Karthik) or Parthiv (Patel).         
	Mystery surrounding Ajantha Mendis         
	Id just like to ask Mahela (Jayawardene) if he will lend Mendis for a couple of practice sessions (Jayawardene smiles). If hes saying he will not, then we will have to deal with it in a personal way.

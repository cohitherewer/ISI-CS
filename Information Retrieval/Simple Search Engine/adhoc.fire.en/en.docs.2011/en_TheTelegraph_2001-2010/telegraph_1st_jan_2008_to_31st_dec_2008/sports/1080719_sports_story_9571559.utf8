	Without the intervention of his father, Italys Edoardo Mangiarotti would probably have followed a totally different sports career path from the one which furnished him with 13 Olympic medals  six golds  and as many fencing world championship titles.  
	His father Giuseppe, a fencing master  he came 4th in the 1908 Games in the team (epee) fencing event  took to teaching his son the rudiments of fencing from the age of seven.         
	Positive results were not long in coming: at 11 Edoardo won the national foil title, and four years later his father taught him the epee.         
	With hardly two years experience, he was selected for the national team which went on to win gold in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, a feat which makes him the second-youngest fencing champion in Olympic history at 17 years old.         
	It was not until 24 years after his Olympic debut that Mangiarotti said farewell to the sport, at the 1960 Games in Rome in front of a home crowd: at the age of 41 Edo won his fourth Olympic title in the team epee event and a silver in the team foil event.         
	Mangiarotti is by far the fencer with the most Olympic medals (13) and with six titles (epee and foil), he is among the five most decorated fencers, equal with three others and just behind the illustrious Hungarian Aladar Gerevich (7).         
	At world level, his credentials are equally impressive winning 10 titles (two individual) all in epee between 1937 and 1958.         
	His older brother, Dario, also went on to forge himself a successful career, since he obtained two gold medals in the team events and one individual gold at the Games. He was also world champion both in individual and in team. (AFP)

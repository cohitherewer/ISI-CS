The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Elena roars into semi-finals
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Elena roars into semi-finals
  - Nadal gets past Querrey Safina in quarters             Serena Williams celebrates her win at the Flushing Meadows on Monday                           
	New York: Olympic champion Elena Dementieva maintained her hot streak to reach the US Open semi-finals with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Switzerlands Patty Schnyder on Tuesday.         
	The fifth-seeded Russian extended her winning run to 11 matches when she became the first player to reach the last four at Flushing Meadows.         
	Facing Schnyder for the 17th time, Dementieva wasted little time in making her intentions clear as she broke the Swiss in the third game after the 15th seed whipped a forehand wide.         
	Dementieva kept up the pace in the second to win her fifth successive match here in straight sets. She will next face either second seed Jelena Jankovic or Austrian Sybille Bammer.         
	Earlier, the Williams sisters will hold another family reunion on centre court at the US Open after registering wins on Monday, setting up a quarter-final encounter at Flushing Meadows.         
	Fourth seed Serena routed French wildcard Severine Bremond 6-2, 6-2, while seventh-seeded elder sister Venus crushed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland 6-1, 6-3.         
	The sisters are 8-8 head-to-head, and 5-5 against each other in Grand Slam tournaments.         
	So this one will bring bragging rights as well as a slot in the semi-finals of the years last major.         
	Its tough to play her because she is so good, said Venus, who won their last duel at this summers Wimbledon final for her fifth singles title at the All England Club.         
	Serena rued the fact that the meeting between the two champions is coming so early in the championship.         
	It sucks, Serena said. Even the semi-finals would have been better than the quarters, but at least one of us will make it to the semi-finals.         
	Rafael Nadal was one step away from his first semi-final in New York after shooting down one of the big-hitting young guns at the Open.         
	The Spaniard, the world No. 1 for the first time at a major, dodged a bevy of bullets from 20-year-old American Sam Querrey, before capturing a 6-2, 5-7, 7-6, 6-3 win.         
	In the last eight, Nadal meets unseeded American Mardy Fish, who beat 32nd seed Gael Monfils of France 7-5, 6-2, 6-2.         
	British sixth seed Andy Murray, 21, stormed into the quarters for the first time with a 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 demolition of Swiss 10th seed Stanislas Wawrinka.         
	Murray will be up against Argentine 19-year-old Juan Martin Del Potro, who reached his first Grand Slam quarter final with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 win over Japans 18-year-old Kei Nishikori.         
	Setting another womens quarter final date was a worn out Dinara Safina and Italys Flavia Pennetta.         
	Safina, who complained of exhaustion, had enough pep to beat Germanys Anna-Lena Groenefeld 7-5, 6-0. Pennetta, the 16th seed, routed former world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo 6-3, 6-0.         
	Venus, who won their last Open encounter in the fourth round in 2005, said Serena is getting into a better form. Nadals tally of unforced errors was unusually high at 41, and his six double faults outnumbered his five aces.         
	Yet when the dust cleared on a windy day at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Nadal had outgunned Querrey and matched his best Open showing by reaching the last eight.           (REUTERS)

      STAR RACER
                  
	Calcutta: There is going to be a lot of action at the RCTC raceground on Sunday, the Derby Day and the hosts are all geared up. Only seven horses are in the line-up for the Derby Stakes but four of them  Star Team, Classic Sky, Steal The Glory and Regal Connection  have the credentials to walk away with the Classic crown. Regal Connection is trainer Vijay Singhs lone hope in the Derby while Daniel David has fielded three  all Classic winners in the recent past.
     
	Track reports also suggest that its not going to be easy for any of the four. However, the strategy and the pace in the race may prove to be the deciding factor and the one with the right blend of speed and stamina will have the last laugh.
     
	The only thing that is worrying the RCTC top brass is the big political rally at the Brigade parade ground planned on that day. The race crowds convenience is the major concern for us, said Cyrus Madan, chairman RCTC. The club has decided to throw the racecourse gates open at 10am, about two hours before the scheduled start of the first race. Those keen to beat the rally traffic should walk in to the racecourse early. They may also head straight to the food court which will begin business early that day, added Madan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villarreal keep Real waiting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Villarreal keep Real waiting
                      
	Madrid: Real Madrid crushed Athletic Bilbao 3-0 at the Bernabeu on Sunday to edge closer to the Primera Liga title but Villarreals 1-0 victory at Real Betis put their celebrations on hold for at least another week.         
	Reals victory means that with four games left to play, they remain 10 points clear of Villarreal at the top of the table on 75 points and will claim their 31st league title if they win next weeks match at Osasuna.         
	Third-placed Barcelona, who are four points behind Villarreal after their 0-2 loss at Deportivo Coruna on Saturday, can now only hope to dispute second place with Villarreal.         
	Argentine striker Javier Saviola paved the way for Reals victory when he took advantage of a rare appearance in the starting line-up to poke home after Bilbao keeper Armando had spilled a shot from Robinho in the 13th minute.         
	Keeper Iker Casillas halted a Bilbao comeback when he produced a great one-handed stop to save a Joseba Garmendia penalty given after Real defender Gabriel Heinze had bundled into Fernando Llorente in the area late in the first half.         
	Real dominated after the break and gained a deserved second when Arjen Robben steered home from close range after a superb pass from Gonzalo Higuain and the Argentine wrapped up the win with a classy curling strike of his own two minutes later.         
	Villarreal clinched their win over a revived Real Betis side thanks to a breathtaking goal from midfielder Marcos Senna.         
	The Spain international fired the ball into the top corner from a metre inside the Betis half after spotting keeper Casto off his line in the 16th minute. (Reuters)

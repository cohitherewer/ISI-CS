	Beijing: Argentina defeated Nigeria 1-0, at the Birds Nest, to win the gold medal, and continue a run of success by Argentine youth teams that may herald a resurgence at the senior level.         
	Leading that resurgence will be Lionel Messi, the Argentine forward known for his dazzling dribbling skills. Between Messis darting runs and Juan Roman Riquelmes long, low passes to Sergio Aguero, meeting Aguero in stride as he ran at goal, Argentina controlled most of the first half.         
	But both teams were slowed by the searing sun and midday heat. The temperature on the field at the National Stadium reached 107 degrees.         
	Although Argentina and Nigeria also played for the gold medal in 1996 in Atlanta  with Nigeria winning, 3-2, for the countrys only gold medal in soccer  a more recent game between the countries is more indicative of their rivalry. Messi and Aguero were also key players on the 2005 Fifa Youth World Cup final. In that game, Argentina beat Nigeria, 2-1. Fourteen players from that 2005 match were featured in Saturdays game here, including Messi, the difference-maker both times.         
	In Saturdays game, Messi dictated the play and set up the games only goal by Angel Di Maria.         
	In the 58th minute, Messi quickly dribbled the ball out of his own half, and sent a perfectly timed through ball to Di Maria, who was not well marked, streaking down the left side. Di Maria ran in on goal alone, expertly chipping from 18 yards over the advancing goalkeeper, Ambruse Vanzekin.         
	Before the goal, both teams had controlled stretches of the game, with Argentina maintaining possession but Nigeria winning a number of dangerous chances on goal.                   Ronaldinho and Diego Maradona in Beijing on Saturday. (Reuters)      
	For Argentina, it was the second consecutive gold medal. The same core group of players also won the under-20 World Cup titles in 2005 and 2007, and many of them already star for the senior national team.         
	Several players stepped up for Argentina, most notably Di Maria, who benefited from the attention defenders paid to Messi.         
	Nigeria tried early in the first half to involve the tall and dynamic forward Solomon Okoronkwo in the attack. But he was castigated to the right flank and the Argentines did a good job of controlling the ball in the centre and switching fields.         
	Nigeria enjoyed far less possession, but each early foray into attack was direct and threatening, causing Argentina keeper Sergio Romero to come out recklessly for the ball, looking shaky more than a few times. After the 26th minute, Nigeria gained more and more advantages as the midfielder Promise Isaac exerted his influence.         
	Isaac broke down the left side in the 34th minute and ran right at the Argentina goal, forcing Romero, who had been quick and careless off his line, to commit early. Sani Kaita was too far outside the back post to do much with the low cross and his angled shot was cleared away. It was one of five Nigerian chances in 15 minutes.         
	Argentina reasserted itself in the second half. Messis first run of the second period ended with a hard shot on goal. Javier Mascherano, who was content to defend in the first half, became more aggressive, making a long run from the back to the edge of the Nigeria box. Isaac, Kaita and Victor Obinna found little time or space to handle the ball in midfield.         
	When Di Maria put Argentina ahead, Nigeria felt the pressure and responded urgently. The defence executed harder slide tackles and Isaac forced the ball into attack. Nigeria had two good shots on goal in two minutes, but the teams failure to get the talented Okoronkwo involved made him increasingly frustrated. Victor Anichebe replaced him, energising Nigeria.         
	Isaac, who played well, was replaced in the 69th minute because of fatigue. After the lemon break, Emanuel Ekpo came on and was immediately effective.         
	Argentina, tired and trying to protect its lead, was content to let Messi and Aguero run free in counter attack until a series of defensive substitutions saw each player walk slowly off the field. Twice in a minute Argentina were penalised for wasting time. Luciano Monzon was cautioned for taking extra seconds on a throw in and Riquelme was similarly penalised for stalling on a free kick in the 81st minute.         
	Late chances by Nigeria were off target and, when the final whistle blew, the men in green shirts fell to the field, exhausted. The Argentina players bounced and danced in a circle at the centre of the field where they would later stand on the top platform to accept their medals.

                                                   Bhajjis an obnoxious weed: Hayden

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh on Tuesday came under fresh verbal abuse from another Australian  opener Matthew Hayden, who labelled the Indian off-spinner an obnoxious little weed. 
    
	Hayden unleashed a stinging verbal attack on Harbhajan on the same day former Aussie Test firebrand Rodney Hogg demanded India stop moaning about trivial on-field clashes, according to a report in the Herald Sun. 
    
	Hayden and Harbhajan locked horns at the SCG on Sunday, with Hayden claiming that he had called the Sikh a bad boy and not a mad boy. 
    
	Its been a bit of a long battle with Harbhajan, the first time I ever met him he was the same little obnoxious weed that he is now, Hayden said on Brisbane radio. 
    
	His record speaks for itself. There is a certain line that you can kind of go to and then you know where you push it and he just pushes it all the time. Thats why he has been charged more than anyone whos ever played, Hayden was quoted as saying. 
    
	The summer of discontent flared again in the ODI in Sydney when India lodged a written complaint against the alleged bullying tactics of Ricky Ponting, Hayden and Andrew Symonds. 
    
	India are more incensed with Hayden, who they alleged has continually tormented Harbhajan. 
    
	However, Hayden on Tuesday made light of the incident and claimed India were complaining because they are losing every game they are playing. 
    
	(I called him) a bad boy, Hayden said. He took offence to that (and) I thought that was quite funny. I said, Mate you should be flattered, its a clothing range. 
    
	Hogg said India should grow up. 
    
	Ive really had a gutful of their whinging, this is international sport, obviously people are going to say things to try to unsettle you, Hogg said. Its not tiddlywinks. So long as its not racial they shouldnt have a problem. 
    
	Hayden said he had repeatedly told Ishant to settle down and on Tuesday said he would like to meet him in a boxing ring. 
    
	He is just young. I have said to him many times, You are 19, take it easy, Hayden said. 
    
	In a late night development, the BCCI criticised Haydens attack on Harbhajan. Secretary Niranjan Shah said matters were going out of hand and going too far, according to a report from New Delhi.

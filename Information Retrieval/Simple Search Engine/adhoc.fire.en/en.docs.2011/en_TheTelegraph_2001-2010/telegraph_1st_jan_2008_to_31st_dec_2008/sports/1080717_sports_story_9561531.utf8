            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali admitted on Wednesday that his boys performance was far from satisfactory.         
	We played badly but I hope we will improve with every match, the veteran coach said after the match.         
	The former international came down heavily on the referee.         
	The refereeing was poor Our players were pushed and pulled from behind but the referee preferred to look the other way This is one of the reasons why Bengal teams suffer in I-League.         
	Shabbir is hoping the team will perform well against East Bengal on Sunday at the Salt Lake stadium.         
	Last time when we met them we were in the pits. We are better placed now and hope to reflect that in our performance, the coach signed off.

  -   Sunil Chetri returns to form with superb strike against Mahindra United         A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Sunil Chetri (left) vies for the ball with a Mahindra United player at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: A lacklustre East Bengal escaped with a draw and a point against Mahindra United in their seventh round I-League match against Mahindra United on Friday.         
	The Calcutta club managed to hold Mahindra 1-1 at a sparsely crowded Salt Lake Stadium.         
	The Mumbai outfit missed an array of chances in the first half before taking the lead in the 59th minute through substitute Paresh Shivalkar. Chidi Edehs cross from the right found an unmarked Shivalkar at the far-post who made no mistake tapping it in.         
	Mahindras joy was short-lived, as East Bengal needed just a couple of minutes to restore parity.         
	The red-and-gold brigade probably gained nothing from the outing on Friday except for striker Sunil Chetris return to scoring ways.         
	The East Bengal frontline, already without the services of Ashim Biswas and Brazilian Edmilson Marques, are heavily dependent on the national team striker for their goals.         
	His failure to score regularly was a concern for the club before this match.         
	In the 51st minute, Sunil held his head in disbelief when he saw his first-time right-footer rebound off the crossbar after Yusif Yakubu set him up beautifully with a back-heel pass.         
	But his tireless efforts bore fruit when his scorching left-footer, off a Yakubu wall-pass, left goalkeeper Subhasish Roy Chowdhury with no chance.         
	The young striker, who hails from the Indian capital, was in the thick of action again, this time though he had to leave the field, struck by Shivalkars raised right foot. East Bengal coach Stanley Rozario claimed that Sunil had gone unconscious for a couple of seconds during the incident.         
	The East Bengal defence looked quite shaky on Friday and would, no doubt, give the coach some cause for worry.         
	Chidi, along with Sushil Kumar Singh and N.P. Pradeep broke through the rival defence on a number of occasions but failed to convert their chances,         
	Mahindra coach Derek Pereira took off Pradeep in the 59th minute and that allowed East Bengal some breathing space in the midfield.         
	The East Bengal midfield, dealt a huge blow by the injury to Rennedy Singh during the pre-match warm-up, looked clueless before the five-man strong Mahindra midfield in the first-half.         
	However, Rozarios move to substitute the pedestrian Mehrajuddin Wadoo with Jayanta Sen brought about a change of fortunes for his side.         
	With this draw, East Bengal reach nine points from seven matches. Mahindra are on seven from the same number of matches.

	East Bengal: Subrata Paul, Nirmal Chetri, Suley Musah, Surkumar Singh, Saumik Dey, Malsawmkima, Sanju Pradhan (Dipankar Roy 90), Mehrajuddin Wadoo (Jayanta Sen 35), Syed Rahim Nabi, Yusif Yakubu, Sunil Chetri.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shiv slips to tied 14th 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shiv slips to tied 14th 
                      
	Moscow: An erratic Shiv Kapur brought home a roller-coaster two-under 70 in the second round to slip to tied 14th in the Inteco Russian Open Golf Championship here.         
	The other Indian in fray, SSP Chowrasia, however, missed the cut after stuttering to a five-over 77 in the second round.         
	Kapur, who carded a flawless 67 in the first round, took his total to seven-under 137. The Delhi pro picked up six birdies against four bogeys in his second round.         
	Overnight tied sixth, Kapur was off the blocks with a birdie on the second hole but a bogey on the fifth brought him back to par. (PTI)

                                                   Shoaib is depressed: Shah Rukh
                      
	Mumbai: Shah Rukh Khan on Friday said he has spoken to Shoaib Akhtar and said the fast bowler was depressed (following the ban).         
	More than playing for IPL, he (Shoaib) is hoping to play for his country again. Shoaib may be outspoken but this ban will be a lesson for him to control his outspokenness.         
	Shoaib is a sportsman and he plays for a living. I, as a human being, hope he can play more cricket, the actor added.         
	Expressing full support, Shah Rukh said he would wait for the decision of the appeals tribunal before deciding the future course of action. (PTI)

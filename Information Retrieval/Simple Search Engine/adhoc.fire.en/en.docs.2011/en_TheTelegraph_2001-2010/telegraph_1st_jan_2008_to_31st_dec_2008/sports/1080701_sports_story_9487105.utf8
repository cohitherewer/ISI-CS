The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spain were a revelation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Spain were a revelation

	It was well past 2.30 am on Monday morning when I went to bed after watching the Euro Cup final. It took me quite some time to get any sleep as I continued to replay the only goal of the match in my mind. And as I reviewed it again and again, I became convinced that the Fernando Torres goal was the best example of technical finesse in the entire tournament.        
	Please hold your breath and give a patient hearing to my arguments before you start disputing my contention. I strongly believe that the goal was the result of a combined move that was a dazzling display of individual skill and astute presence of mind.        
	There would be many to applaud the Torres strike as the Spanish striker stretched himself at the right moment to completely baffle Lehman under the German bar. But it was all started by Xavi Fernandez, the man who provided the deep pass to Torres.        
	Please have a careful look at the replay again and you will find that Fernandez forward pass was weaved with a clever backspin of the ball. It left the German defender Phllip Lahm thoroughly confused and helped Torres to grab the ball.         
	With a backspin on it, the ball slowed down. While it became easier for Torres to connect it at the right time, Lehman was the biggest loser.        
	As it is, the German custodian was bit late in coming out of his charge. He expected the ball to reach him before Torres but alas, he didnt realise how quick the Spaniard could be at the crucial juncture.        
	As a striker, I had scored many goals for India in vital matches, including the one in the Asian Games final in 1962, but still, at this age, I am ready to walk a few miles to watch a goal like that.        
	To me, Spain were a revelation throughout the tournament and the final was no exception.         
	What thrilled me most was their ability to play umpteenth number of passes in the rival box even though the opponent defenders were breathing down their necks. They waited for the right time to go for the final attempt at goal, yet managed to keep possession of the ball most of the time. It was an amazing display of quality football.        
	A few days back, I read an article in which the Indian national coach Bob Houghton was quoted saying that the Indian footballers lacked in fitness. Though there was nothing new in his observation, on Monday morning, while watching the Euro Cup final I couldnt stop thinking how right the Indian coach was.        
	The Spanish team were incredibly fit. So much so, that in the last 10 minutes, when Germany were expected to attack with all their vigour and energy, the Spanish players were all over.         
	Their two players  Ramos and Senna  had surely covered around 75 metres from box to box at least 50 times. Yet, they were seen looking for goals even during the closing stages.        
	Germany could never impress me technically in the entire tournament. But I always held the Germans in high esteem since 1954 when they defeated Hungary, the Magical Magyars of Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis and Nandor Hidekutti to win the World Cup in Switzerland.        
	I had a feeling that Germans might stop Spain on their tracks because of their teamwork, discipline and winning mentality. But Spain made them look like novices with high-quality pressing football. It was an astonishing experience to watch the Germans being left a helpless bunch on the pitch by the never say die Spaniards.        
	The tactical ability of Spain coach Luis Aragones was once again the high point of this years Euro Cup. He almost forced the Germans to go into attacks in the early part of the match. It proved disastrous. Spain, on the other hand, played their cards cleverly. So bold was Aragones in his moves that he didnt hesitate to send both Fabregas and Torres to the bench in the final quarter of the match. Anyone else would have shuddered to make such a move.        
	But then, fortune favours the brave.  
	PK rsquo;s pick  
	 Luis Aragones (Spain)  
	 The wise man of Hortaleza has often been termed as an eccentric but the Spanish coach proved that he was right not to stand down after his team lost out in the second round of the World Cup in 2006. Regardless of what was said about him, the 69-year-old coach helped Spain shed their underachievers rsquo; tag by winning the country rsquo;s first major football title since 1964. To me, he is the number one coach in the championship because he forced Torres to say that the coach was a father figure for the team. Apart from his technical brilliance, his ability to keep the squad together was a tremendous achievement.   
	 Joachim Loew (Germany)  
	 The 48-year-old coach was once described by then Germany coach Jurgen Kilnsmann as ldquo;much more than an assistant rdquo; and Loew, in his very first major tournament, proved how right the legendary striker was. Despite the defeat in the final, Loew was able to enhance his own reputation because of Germany rsquo;s fine tactical victory over Luiz Felipe Scolari in the quarter final against Portugal. He, in fact, came close to writing an even bigger success story but Spain turned out to be too big an obstacle. Personally, I was never convinced about the greatness of this present German squad but Loew, to my pleasant surprise, managed to convert the side into a winning combination.  
	 Guus Hiddink (Russia)  
	 Called the Czar of ldquo;Golden Guus rdquo;, Hiddink once again worked his magic with a team of relative unknowns to reach the semi-finals. He did the same with South Korea in the 2002 World Cup and made Australia play brilliant football in the last World Cup. I hold him in high esteem as he has also done wonders with the club teams. Under Hiddink, PSV Eindhoven won a treble in the 80s, including the European Cup. He was not equally successful with Valencia or Real Madrid but his stamp of class was always there. There are some coaches who always perform well on the big stage and Hiddink is definitely one of them.

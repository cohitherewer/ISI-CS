The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United keep home fires burning
                                                   United keep home fires burning
            OLIVER BROWN                      
	So Manchester United keep the home fires burning, not in the most incandescent style but with enough sustained spark to reignite their quest for dominance in Europe. They can do it domestically, and on Tuesday night their hegemony seemed to be spreading as a much-changed team extinguished the flickering challenge of Lyon with one blast of brilliance from Cristiano Ronaldo.         
	The 23-year-old recorded his 30th goal of the season, an almost fanciful tally for a winger, while his side swept to a 10th straight European win at Old Trafford.         
	Granted, there were none of the dream-like flourishes that did for Roma last season. That was at the quarter final stage  this was only the first knockout round, but still United, galvanised by the irrepressible Ronaldo, served enough notice that they were slipping into a higher gear. For Sir Alex Ferguson, this was also a vindication, as he scrapped the hoary adage that you should never change a winning team with a line-up that bore no resemblance to that which had cast Fulham aside so clinically in the league.         
	There was a sense Ferguson had been mischievous in his meddling for this match, using even the most pivotal of European nights to demonstrate the depth of his eclectic squad. Thus Wayne Rooney returned to the role where most believe he is least comfortable, as the genuine lone striker, while Ronaldo was left to wreak merry mayhem on the wing. At first the system looked awkward, each United attack dissolving into speculative drives from distance. Even Ronaldos first decisive break on the right came to nought as the redoubtable Cris slid in to intercept the Portuguese.         
	The more United suffered, the more Lyon settled. Although the threat of Karim Benzema, perhaps discomfited by his well-publicised spat with strike partner Ben Arfa before this game, never materialised, the French champions have attackers in abundance and Kim Kallstrom drew roars from a raucous pocket of travelling fans when his fearsome drive had to be parried by Van der Sar.         
	Ultimately, though, Uniteds gift of finding the perfect windows in these games to strike the decisive blow could not be contained. The tense moments just before half-time offered a chance to deflate Lyon psychologically and United, at last adapting to their uncharacteristic 4-5-1 formation, responded.         
	It was not the prettiest of breakthroughs: Anderson, who had increasingly had the ball on a string, fired in a shot that bounced off Rooney, allowing Ronaldo to move wide and beat Coupet from an acute angle. The winger was mobbed by his teammates at the corner flag while Ferguson, inscrutable to this juncture, pumped his fists with palpable relief.         
	But the precariousness of Uniteds position was always in evidence. As Rooney continued to be constrained by Lyons muscular back line, Ferguson finally had to submit to the swelling chant of Argentina, Argentina. The impressive Anderson duly made way for Tevez, but this heralded the evenings most nervous moment.         
	Kader Keita, himself only just brought on as a substitute, showed a lethal turn of pace in the 74th minute, arrowing a shot beneath the hands of Van der Sar but it rebounded off the post.         
	United swiftly hit back, Rooney seizing upon a wayward back-pass from Ben Arfa only for Coupet to gather his chip. Tevez was in prime position to add gloss to this victory after a Rooney surge three minutes from time, the but cross was errant.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     A.C. Muthiah accuses TNCA of intimidation
                      
	Chennai: Former BCCI president A. C. Muthiah has accused the incumbents in the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) of vindictive acts against him.         
	N. Srinivasan is the current president and was once seen as a Muthiah protg. The tables have obviously turned from the time both happened to be in the anti-Jagmohan Dalmiya lobby.         
	The powers that be at the TNCA has been subjecting me to vilification and a series of vindictive acts ever since my decision to bring back sanity and sporting spirit in the TNCA came to be known to them. Of course, I am dealing with them suitably.         
	Now I find that the deputies assisting me in the ensuing election campaign are facing threats to their body and life, he said in a press statement.         
	The elections are due in the second week of June.         
	Yesterday, K. L. Balaji, a former member of the executive committee of the TNCA got severely beaten by some unidentified persons, the statement added.           (AGENCIES)

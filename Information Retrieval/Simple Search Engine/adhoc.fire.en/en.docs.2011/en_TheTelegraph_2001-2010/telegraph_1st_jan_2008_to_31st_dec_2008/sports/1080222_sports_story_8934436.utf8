	Dhaka: Graeme Smith will equal the South African captaincy record held by the late Hansie Cronje when he leads his team in the first Test against Bangladesh starting on Friday. It will be Smiths 53rd Test at the helm and the opening batsman said it would be a great accomplishment if he went on to surpass Cronje.

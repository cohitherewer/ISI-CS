The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Argentina go one up
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Argentina go one up
                  Nalbandian after the win on Friday                     
	Mar Del Plata: David Nalbandian raced to a straight-sets win over David Ferrer to hand Argentina a 1-0 lead over Spain in the Davis Cup final on Friday.         
	Nalbandian won 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 in one hour 59 minutes to give the hosts the perfect start in their bid to win the competition for the first time.         
	It was a great game, Nalbandian said in an on-court interview. It could not have been better, to win it quickly the way I did.         
	The Argentine was quick out off the blocks as he broke serve in the third game and repeated the trick in the seventh when Ferrer double-faulted on break point.         
	Ferrerbroke back in the next game but Nalbandian replied immediately to wrap up the first set in 53 minutes.         
	The Spaniard struggled to find an answer to Nalbandians flowing tennis as he dropped his serve again in the fourth game of the next set having led 40-0.         
	Ferrer broke back in the next game but it was only a minor hitch for the hosts as Nalbandian broke twice more to finish the set in 38 minutes.         
	In the final set, Nalbandian broke in the sixth game before producing two aces to earn three match points.         
	He finished things off with another powerful serve, which Ferrer could not return.           (REUTERS)

                                                     English affair is unresolved
            HENRY WINTER                 Arsenals Philippe Senderos and Liverpools Fernando Torres vie for the ball during their Champions League match on Wednesday. (AP)                                 
	Advantage Liverpool. Showing all their European experience, Rafa Benitezs side absorbed everything that Arsenal threw at them on Wednesday night and will believe they can reach the semi-finals at an impassioned Anfield next Tuesday.         
	Billed as a very English affair, this first leg was shaped by goals from a Togo international, Emmanuel Adebayor, and a Dutchman, Dirk Kuyt, who equalised. Arguably the most impressive performer was the Argentinian, Javier Mascherano, who delivered a determined 90-minute shift of ball-winning and simple distribution.         
	Encouragingly for England, Theo Walcott darted on and displayed his pace and dribbling abilities in troubling Liverpools defence, although he could not force a winner. Encouragingly for the FAs respect campaign, there was not a hint of malice or dissent on view in the first of the Arsenal-Liverpool trilogy.         
	Next stop, same stop. They reconvene here in the Premier League on Saturday, when surely changes will be made by Wenger and Benitez to keep their stars fresh for Tuesdays resumption of Champions League combat. Liverpool have the belief, and the away goal, although they had to come from behind Wednesday.         
	It was little surprise that it had required a set-piece to break the deadlock. As crowded as a Tube carriage in rush hour, midfield provided no room to breathe, let alone move.         
	Ken Livingstone could have extended his Congestion Charge to this green swathe off the Holloway and made a fortune. With both sides deploying lone strikers, space was at a premium in the centre.         
	Steven Gerrard was hounded into surrendering possession by Emmanuel Eboue, who promptly lost it to another tackle from Mascherano. With Cesc Fabregas increasingly prominent, Arsenal hinted at being the first to impose their undoubted skill, to find a path out of the midfield maze.         
	It took Adebayors 23rd-minute goal from a corner to open the game up, to throw down the gauntlet that Liverpool immediately seized with an almost instant equaliser.         
	Fabregas and Robin van Persie looked to orchestrate a corner on Arsenals right, the presence of such deft feet, left and right, instilling doubt in Liverpools defence, allowing Adebayor his split-second of fruitful freedom.         
	It was the left foot of Van Persie that connected first with the ball, tapping it to Fabregas, who immediately laid it back.         
	Van Persie, whose intelligent use of possession has been much missed this season, curled it into the box with just enough trajectory to keep it away from Pepe Reina.         
	Liverpools keeper watched in frustration as Adebayor eluded Sami Hyypia and headed firmly in. Jamie Carragher threw his hands up in anger at conceding such a soft goal to Adebayor. He ran behind Reinas goal, beating his right hand against the club crest on his shirt as supporters celebrated his 24th goal of the season. The relief at scoring appeared to relax Arsenal momentarily, and Liverpool took advantage within three minutes.         
	The move began slowly, Liverpool parading the Continental trick of knowing when to race through the gears. Ryan Babel dragged the ball down the left and suddenly flicked it inside to Gerrard, who in turn found Fernando Torres. They now have such an understanding that Gerrard was already off and running, knowing that Torres would work the ball back to him.         
	When it came, Gerrards response was superb, the midfielder embarking on the kind of left-footed dribble that John Barnes was admired for. Eboue raced across to close Gerrard down, but Liverpools captain simply guided the ball expertly around him.         
	As Gerrards burning ambition threatened to harm Arsenal, Kolo Toure rushed across like a panicky fire-man. He, too, was beaten by Gerrard, who again neatly manoeuvred the ball around a red shirt. Mathieu Flamini dived in to block Gerrards cross, but he was too late. The ball was speeding inexorably into the middle where Kuyt, making light of Gael Clichys presence, turned the ball in.         
	The game swung back Arsenals way, Wengers men enjoying 61 per cent of first-half possession. Liverpool had to show their defensive zeal.         
	Fabio Aurelio slid in with a magnificent challenge on Adebayor. Hyypia showed all his experience in timing his tackle to thwart the onrushing Toure.         
	Wenger unleashed Walcott, who immediately sprinted down the left after winning the ball off Martin Skrtel and then firing in a fierce shot that Reina just tipped away.

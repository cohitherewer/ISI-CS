The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sunny: Moment still brings tears
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sunny: Moment still brings tears
                      
	New Delhi: Twenty five years may have elapsed ever since India scripted history by winning the World Cup, but legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar said every moment of the triumph was still fresh in his mind.         
	Every bit of those momentous victories are still very fresh in my mind. Its all there, the field placing, the fall of wickets, everything. I can still see them through my minds eye, Gavaskar, a key memeber of Kapils Devils, said here.         
	That particular moment when Kapil hoisted the World Cup still brings tears to my eyes, he said.         
	Walking down memory lane, Gavaskar still remembered the particular moment when the final delivery of Mohinder Amarnath dismissed West Indies last man Michael Holding in the final at the Lords.         
	It was Jimmy who was bowling to holding. The moment his delivery hit Holding on the pads, my first reaction was to save the leg bye but by the time I collected the ball, I realised that he was given out and there was a pandemonium. I ran round the crowd towards the dressing room, he said.         
	I still have the ball with me. I hope to take the autographs from all the teammates (of that team) as some of the signatures have faded by now, he added.         
	Of all the finest moments of the World Cup, one that Gavaskar will never forget was the unbeaten 175-run knock by skipper Kapil Dev.         
	It was the best innings I have ever witnessed in my entire life, he said.         
	Lauding Kapils captaincy, Gavaskar said it was the lanky fast bowlers composure that made the difference.         
	During the matches, Kapil was getting advice from all quarters. It was difficult for him but all credit goes to him, he said.         
	Gavaskar felt the reason behind 1983s stupendous feat was the contribution of the all-rounders. We had some very good all-rounders.

                                                   2008 CALENDAR amp; THE CIRCUITS
                      
	Formula One takes a step into the dark this season with new faces and new races, including the first to be held at night in Singapore. That floodlit Grand Prix in late September will be the highlight of the 18-round season that starts in Australia on March 16, with the city state also witnessing the sports first street race in Asia.         
	March 16 Australia (Albert Park, Melbourne). Circuit length: 5.303km, Race distance: 58 laps. Total distance covered: 307.574km. 2007 winner: Kimi Raikkonen (Finland) Ferrari.         
	A temporary parkland circuit, but still way better than many permanent ones in Europe. The race is a Formula One favourite but it faces an uncertain future with pressure from Bernie Ecclestone for it to be held at night.         
	March 23 Malaysia (Sepang). 5.543km, 56 laps, 310.408km. Fernando Alonso (Spain) McLaren.         
	The high humidity makes this a strength-sapping race for drivers. Organisers are looking into switching to a night format from 2009, in line with neighbouring Singapore.         
	April 6 Bahrain (Sakhir). 5.412km, 57 laps, 308.238km. Felipe Massa (Brazil) Ferrari. Starts 1130 GMT.         
	The first and only race in West Asia, until Abu Dhabi makes its debut next year. Surrounded by desert, Sakhir is one of the most modern tracks but sand can be a problem.         
	April 27Spain (Circuit de Catalunya, Barcelona). 4.655km, 66 laps, 307.104km. Massa.         
	The most familiar circuit to all the teams, who regularly test there. On the calendar since 1991 but races have often been processional.         
	May 11 Turkey (Istanbul Park). 5.338km, 58 laps, 309.396km. Massa.         
	One of two anti-clockwise circuits in the championship, the other being Interlagos in Brazil. Likened to Spa for its fast and undulating layout, the circuit is on the Asian side of Istanbul. Some 67 per cent of each lap is spent at full throttle.         
	May 25Monaco. 3.340km, 78 laps, 260.520km. Alonso.         
	The jewel in the crown and still the most glamorous race of them all. Qualifying is crucial due to the difficulty of overtaking in the tight and twisty streets. The slowest race on the calendar, but still a thrill.         
	June 8 Canada (Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal). 4.361km, 70 laps, 305.270km. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) McLaren.         
	Named after the late Ferrari driver and father of 1997 champion Jacques. Now the only North American race and a favourite of fans and drivers. The circuit on a man-made island in the St Lawrence Seaway can be dusty in practice due to lack of use and puts a heavy burden on brakes.         
	June 22France (Circuit de Nevers, Magny-Cours). 4.411km, 70 laps, 308.586km. Raikkonen.         
	Granted a reprieve last year but unlikely to remain on the calendar for much longer, with Ecclestone pushing for a Paris Grand Prix. The circuit is good, with a very smooth surface, but its location in the middle of rural France plays against it.         
	July 6 Britain (Silverstone). 5.141 km, 60 laps, 308.355km. Raikkonen.         
	Another circuit in need of a revamp and regularly threatened by Ecclestone, despite having hosted the very first championship race in 1950. The contract runs out at the end of next year. The track is one of the longest in F1 and popular with drivers.         
	July 20 Germany (Hockenheim). 4.574km, 67 laps, 308.863km. Alonso (at Nrburgring).         
	Now alternating with Nrburgring as host of Germanys one race. Once a fearsome circuit with a fast stretch through the forest, tamed in 2002 with a new stadium section. Britains world champion Jim Clark died here in 1968.         
	Aug 3 Hungary (Hungaroring, Budapest). 4.381km, 70 laps, 306.458km. Hamilton.         
	The first race behind the old Iron Curtain, still the only one in Eastern Europe. Ranks after Monaco as second slowest in Formula One, although Valencia and Singapore have yet to be assessed.         
	Aug 24 Europe (Valencia, Spain). 5.440km, 57 laps, 310.080km. Alonso (Held for the last time at Nrburgring last year.)         
	No previous race at this circuit. Europes second street circuit, this new race will be set against a backdrop of the Americas Cup port.         
	Sept 7 Belgium (Spa-Francorchamps). 7.004km, 44 laps, 308.052km. Raikkonen.         
	The longest and second fastest race on the calendar and one of the all-time greats, despite struggling with poor attendances and financial problems. Weather conditions are unpredictable. The left-right sweep of Eau Rouge is less awesome than it was but still a big test of bravery.         
	Sept 14 Italy (Monza). 5.793km, 53 laps, 306.720km. Alonso.         
	The oldest and fastest race. Set in a royal park north-east of Milan, the circuit sees speeds of more than 360kph and an average of more than 240kph per lap. No other circuit has hosted more races.         
	Sept 28Singapore. 5.067km, 61 laps, 309.087km. No previous race.         
	Promises to be the most spectacular newcomer to the sport, with the first night race around the Marina Bay area. Asias first street circuit.         
	Oct 12 Japan (Fuji). 4.563km, 67 laps, 305.416km. Hamilton.         
	Made its return last year after a 30-year absence. The longest main straight on the calendar. Owned by Toyota, the circuit overlooked by Mount Fuji will alternate from next year with Honda-owned Suzuka. Heavy rain played havoc with last years race.         
	Oct 19China (Shanghai). 5.451km, 56 laps, 305.066km. Raikkonen.         
	A vast state-of-the-art circuit lacking the passion and soul of older European venues. To the north-east of Shanghai, it can seat 200,000 spectators.         
	Nov 2Brazil (Interlagos, Sao Paulo). 4.309km, 71 laps, 305.909km. Raikkonen.         
	A complete contrast to Shanghai, with ramshackle facilities made up for by the sheer passion of the locals and the bowl-like amphitheatre. The other anti-clockwise circuit after Turkey, the track is undulating and fast. Rain is always a risk

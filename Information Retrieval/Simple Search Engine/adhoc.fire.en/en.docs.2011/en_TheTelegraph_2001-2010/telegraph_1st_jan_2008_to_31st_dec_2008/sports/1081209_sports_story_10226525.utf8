	Melbourne: Australian vice-captain Michael Clarke has dismissed suggestions that the world champions were after more money and less work, insisting that players are only concerned about their careers being cut short due to too much cricket.         
	Players are negotiating their new contracts with Cricket Australia (CA) amid reports that Ricky Pontings men want their workload cut down and pay-cheques increased.         
	I can guarantee thats certainly not the case, Clarke said to an Australian radio.         
	The major issue with the players at the moment is because of the amount of cricket going on, and that includes all forms of the game, guys careers are not going to last as long as they used to.         
	Thats the worrying factor, he insisted.           (PTI)

                                                   Meeting to tackle key issues
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The two-day (Tuesday and Wednesday) ICC Chief Executives Committee (CEC) meeting would discuss a range of issues, some of which will be considered by the ICC Board when it meets in March, according to a media release on Sun- day.         
	Among the items on the agenda are the following:         
	 World Cup 2011 format: The CEC will review potential formats and will make a recommendation to the IDI Board for approval. The proposed formats include 14 and 16 team options, all of which are capable of being played over a shorter duration than the 2007 event.         
	 Scheduling summit: The CEC meeting will follow a scheduling summit also in Kuala Lumpur which has been called to review the draft international programme for the period post 2012. Tour programming of four, five and six year cycles will be under consideration.         
	The CEC will provide ICC management with feedback and comment on the proposed programmes and any recommendations will then be reviewed by the ICC Board.         
	 Technology: The CEC will review a proposal prepared by the ICC management on the use of technology in decision-making. The proposal has been produced following directions from the ICC Cricket Committee and suggests the using of an umpire decision review system on trial during the England versus South Africa Test series in England in July-August 2008.         
	According to the proposal, the captain of the fielding team or the batsman, as the case may be, will be entitled to a limited number of occasions to request the on-field umpire to review his decision in consultation with the TV umpire.         
	The CEC will review this proposal and make a recommendation to the ICC Board. If the trial is given the go-ahead, the final playing conditions will be developed in consultation with the ICC Cricket Committee.         
	The CEC will also discuss a range of issues arising out of the Indian Premier League and the Indian Cricket League.

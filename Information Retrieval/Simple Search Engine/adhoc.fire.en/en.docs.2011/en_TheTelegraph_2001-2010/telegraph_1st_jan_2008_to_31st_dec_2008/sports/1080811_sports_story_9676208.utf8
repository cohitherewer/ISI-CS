The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Holes exposed in security blanket

	The killing of an American tourist in Beijing Saturday showed that even a security apparatus as comprehensive and all seeing as that employed by the Chinese state has its inherent limitations.         
	China has spent more than 5 billion to make the Beijing Olympics the most secure in the 112-year history of the modern Games, but even these vast resources could not prevent the actions of a single disturbed man.         
	The attack occurred despite the deployment of 150,000 guards from the Peoples Armed Police, as well as another 290,000 civilian volunteers tasked to be their eyes and ears in the city.         
	On almost every street corner in Beijing a soldier can be seen standing to attention, while helicopters circle relentlessly overhead, their bulbous camera pods able to zoom in on any suspicious activity.         
	In railway stations, shopping malls and hotels a network of 300,000 CCTV cameras keep watch on foreign visitors and Chinese nationals, alert to any activity which the Party might deem inappropriate.         
	As well as hard power  with anti-aircraft missile batteries outside the Olympic Stadium  China has mobilised a network of neighbourhood committees to keep a grass roots watch on society.         
	It was on these networks of politically reliable elders that they were relying to prevent an attack such as yesterdays, alerting the police to potential trouble before it happened.         
	This incident will therefore doubly pain the Chinese authorities, who made no secret of their determination that nothing should distract the world from the perfectly planned grandeur of Chinas global coming-out parade.         
	In Tiananmen Square on Saturday protesters from Students for a Free Tibet once again tried to exercise their freedom of speech, but were quickly removed by plain-clothes officers of the Chinese State Security Bureau.         
	Security in Beijing has been tight to the point of suffocation, with all forms of dissent and protest smothered with a restrained but unyielding hand.         
	For some of the 450,000 foreign visitors to Beijing, the effect of such iron-fisted security has been to dampen the spirit of the Olympics.         
	On Saturday the great plazas and squares constructed for the Games were almost devoid of the ordinary people that make the Olympics come alive.         
	James Marshall, 32, on his way to watch the fencing, said: It seems like they wanted perfection, but forgot that you also need some real people too.

	Chennai: Test captain Anil Kumble thinks the forthcoming three-match series against South Africa would be a challenging one as the Proteas are a tough unit to beat.         
	When they came to India the last time for the two-Test series, it was tough. After drawing the Kanpur Test, we won in Calcutta through Harbhajan Singhs excellent performance (7/87) with the ball, he told a press conference.         
	It is going to be a tough challenge this time around too. They have great players in their ranks. This time of the year is going to be hot. We have the experience and also quality. I am sure, we will be able to win the series, he said.         
	On whether he would opt for regular openers or promote Rahul Dravid to open the innings, Kumble said: Dravid will bat at No.3.         
	On sledging, Kumble echoed the views of his South African counterpart Graeme Smith, saying he would prefer to focus on cricket.         
	Kumble accused the media of creating the senior-junior controversy and said the team was committed to work for success in both forms of the game.         
	I think senior-junior (controversy) is not with the team members... It is the media that has made it out to be. I dont know why they talk of cricket players like this, he said.         
	I can assure you that there is no question of junior-senior. It is all about ensuring that we play to our potential, be committed to our roles and work for the success of the team. That is what is happening in both formats of the game, Kumble said.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten showered praise on Kumble. Kumble has proved his worth as an international player. He has got tremendous support from his players. You cannot ask for more than that.         
	He discounted suggestions that his knowledge about the South African cricketers would make his job easier. In this current world of television, everyone gets to know about every player and being a South African is not an added advantage.

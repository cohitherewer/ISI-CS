	Career Highlights  
	 Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia has been one of the great stories of Indian golf in recent times.   
	 The son of a greenskeeper, the Calcutta-based S.S.P. enjoyed a breakout year in 2006 when he challenged compatriot Jyoti Randhawa for the Hero Honda Asian Tour Indian Open title before losing in a play-off that included Vijay Kumar. He had a great chance to win the title during regulation play but missed a 15-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole. He also finished runner-up to Arjun Atwal in the 1999 Indian Open.   
	 It was only weeks earlier that S.S.P. was heartbroken as he had led the Mercuries Taiwan Masters by three strokes after the opening round but was later disqualified after it was realised he had signed for a wrong score. He ended his year on a high note by finishing tied 10th in the Volvo Masters of Asia.   
	 In 2007, he endured a tough start to his campaign as he missed numerous cuts. However, his form improved with four top-20s in the second half of the season where his lone top-10 finish was a tied ninth in the Hero Honda Indian Open   
	Personal  
	 His father was the greenkeeper at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club which was where S.S.P. picked up the game at the age of 10.   
	 The self-taught golfer is nicknamed Chipputtsia because of his superb short game. Says he used to sneak out on to the golf course to play a few holes before being chased off by staff members and has now bought a house next to the course where he is welcomed to practice and play freely.

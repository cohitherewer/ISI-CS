The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Good I didnt quit in 2006: Bhaichung
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Good I didnt quit in 2006: Bhaichung
  - India captain wants to be remembered as a motivator       JAYDEEP BASU            Bhaichung Bhutia                                 
	Hyderabad: Two years after reversing his decision to quit international soccer, Bhaichung Bhutia feels it could have been the worst moment of his career had he decided to go ahead with it.         
	Bhutia has played a big role in Indias march to the semi-finals in the ongoing AFC Challenge Cup, scoring two of the four goals so far.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, the Indian captain said: Had I quit in 2006, I would have lived to regret my decision. That was a time when I was getting increasingly bored with the entire scenario and felt I was getting nowhere. I was lucky that at that time Bob Houghton took over as the national coach and I decided to continue. I could never imagine I could be so much richer in experience and learn so many things in the last two years.         
	He still regrets that I.M. Vijayan stopped playing football three years before Houghton joined as national coach.         
	In my 15-year career, he is the best Indian footballer I have come across, Bhutia said. He was a complete player and a man of great technical brilliance. Sadly, he didnt have anyone to guide him. I wish he played under Houghton!         
	The Indian captain said he was misunderstood when he remarked that foreign coaches were better than most of their Indian counterparts.         
	I had no intention of hurting anyone, Bhutia said. All I wanted to say was that football in European countries is far more developed than it is in India. Given their experience and technical knowledge, the foreign coaches are much better. You cant compare Houghton with most of the Indian coaches, Bhutia said. It will be like comparing Kapil Dev with a Brazilian cricket coach or Bhaichung Bhutia with Cristiano Ronaldo. Let us admit the fact that our present national coach is miles ahead of most people in India.         
	Asked whether he would like to be remembered as the greatest Indian striker, Bhutia said: That is for others to judge. I shall be happy if I am remembered as a motivator, who helped his fellow players and tried to give his best for the country and the club.

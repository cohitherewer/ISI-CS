	Barcelona: Billed as the showdown to determine Argentinas best player, Lionel Messi left no doubt about who deserves the tag after scoring one goal and setting up another in FC Barcelonas 6-1 win over Sergio Aguero and Atletico Madrid.         
	The 21-year-old Messi scored with a free kick shortly after earning a penalty that Samuel Eto converted. Messi then set up the Cameroon striker for Barcelonas fourth goal on Saturday before creating several more occasions before the half ended.         
	Leo was marvellous, Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said. He is a really decisive player.         
	Messi nearly managed to add another impressive strike to a growing resume of highlight-reel goals in the 40th minute.         
	The Barcelona winger collected the ball just inside the Atletico half and held off Raul Garcia to take his run into the area. He then dribbled around defender Tomas Ujfalusi and beat goalkeeper Gregory Coupet who, watched the quick chip bounce wide of the post.         
	Its been a great day, Messi said. It is a shame that I could not score (with that run), but more importantly, we had a great win and I am very pleased.         
	Messis performances this week have further cemented his reputation of being the worlds best player, with only Manchester Uniteds Cristiano Ronaldo able to contest.         
	The Rosario native came on as a substitute to score both goals  including one in injury-time  to salvage a 2-1 Champions League win at Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday.         
	Aguero had few chances to impress as Barcelonas defence smothered the Atletico striker  and the teams offence.         
	The 20-year-old Aguero leads the Champions League with three goals, but while Messi roared along with the 98,772 spectators, Aguero looked disconsolate.           (AP)

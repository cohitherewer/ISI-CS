The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spain move into semis
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Spain move into semis
                      
	London: Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez displayed nerves of steel to win a marathon doubles match on Saturday and propel Spain into the Davis Cup semi-finals.         
	They battled for almost five hours before grinding out a 6-7, 7-6, 6-4, 2-6, 12-10 win over Philipp Kohlschreiber and Philipp Petzschner, giving Spain an unbeatable 3-0 lead over Germany in Bremen.         
	The Americans lead their tie against France 2-1 in Winston-Salem and, despite going down in the doubles, will be favourites to seal their passage into the last four.         
	Top ranked Mike and Bob Bryan missed out on a chance to become the most successful American doubles pairing when they lost 7-6, 5-7, 3-6, 4-6 to Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra.         
	They had shared a 14-1 win-loss Davis Cup record with John McEnroe and Peter Fleming but must now wait before securing a 15th win.         
	Argentina and Russia moved a step closer to meeting in the other semi-final after both nations won their doubles clashes to take a 2-1 lead into Sundays reverse singles.         
	David Nalbandian and Guillermo Canas made the most of the raucous Buenos Aires atmosphere to beat Swedens Jonas Bjorkman and Robert Linstedt 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 in an ill-tempered match.         
	In Moscow, the Czechs found Russia to be perfect hosts and were given a roaring welcome when they stepped on court but the generosity in spirit stopped there.         
	World No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko teamed up with Igor Andreev to outsmart Czech duo Pavel Vizner and Radek Stepanek 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4.         
	Russia captain Shamil Tarpishchev had left Davydenko out of Fridays singles after the player flew in late to Moscow following his triumph in Miami last weekend.           (REUTERS)

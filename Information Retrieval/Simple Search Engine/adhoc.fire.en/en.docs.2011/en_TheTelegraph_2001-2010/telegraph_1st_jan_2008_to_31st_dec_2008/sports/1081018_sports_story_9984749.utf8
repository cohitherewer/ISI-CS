	New Delhi: Somdev Dev Varman and Nathan Healey stretched their impressive run in the $50,000 Calabasas Challenger event to the semi-finals after beating Prakash Amritraj and Alex Kuznetsov in California.         
	Somdev and his Australian partner, who entered the event as qualifiers, beat the Indo-American pair 6-4, 4-6, 10-7 in the quarter finals of the hard-court event.         
	The winners now they face Americans Brian Battistone and Dann Battistone.         
	Somdevs singles campaign was cut short in the first round and now Amritraj is the lone Indian left in the fray. He is up against American top seed Vincent Spadea in the quarter finals.

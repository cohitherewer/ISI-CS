The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussie, NZ, England players issue threat
                                                                                                                                                                                             Aussie, NZ, England players issue threat
    - The day after Pakistans confirmation as Champions Trophy hosts             A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Virender Sehwag being escorted by security personnel on his arrival in Karachi for the Asia Cup                                 
	Calcutta/Melbourne: The ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan faces the prospect of a boycott by top players from Australia and New Zealand with their cricketers association maintaining that the troubled country remains too risky to tour.               
	Kevin Pietersen has become the first England cricketer to express doubts about travelling to Pakistan. He said: For sure, I have reservations... Everybody has reservations about going to Pakistan  all the Australians and New Zealanders... I dont think pressure should be put on any individual, especially when your life could be at risk.               
	The ICC on Thursday decided not to shift the high-profile tournament out of Pakistan but the decision has not gone down well with the players associations who have called on their governing bodies not to send a team.         
	If it continues in Pakistan at this volatile time, unfortunately many of the worlds best players wont participate, which is not a good outcome for cricket, Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) chief Paul Marsh said in a statement.         
	Based on the independent information and advice received, we maintain that the risks are simply too great for the ACA to recommend that our players tour Pakistan at this time.         
	We would expect Cricket Australia to adopt the same position, he added.         
	The ICC, after a teleconference with the eight participating nations, decided to retain Pakistan as the venue despite opposition from the cricket boards of Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa.         
	Marsh said ICCs decision was disappointing and despite security reports giving an all-clear, Pakistan remained a risky place to hold the biennial event.         
	The ACA continues to have serious concerns with our players touring Pakistan for the Champions Trophy and we are disappointed with the ICCs decision, Marsh said.         
	Englands professional cricketers association chief executive Sean Morris was slightly guarded in his reaction but even he admitted that security of players remains at risk.         
	Weve still got some very serious concerns, despite the fact that the Pakistan Cricket Board have made every effort they can to try to make it as safe as possible, Morris was quoted as saying by BBC sport.         
	But, unfortunately, in that part of the world there are some matters that are beyond anyones control. I think one thing that the England And Wales Cricket Board has said  and something we are very well aligned on  is the one thing you are never going to compromise on is security.         
	You may find a world-class event that doesnt feature a large number of world-class players. That would be a real shame for cricket, he added.         
	However, the New Zealand players association urged the Black Caps to boycott the event.         
	Association head Heath Mills said the ICCs decision was poor and is in complete contradiction of the governing bodys previous stand that players safety was top priority.         
	We believe this is a poor ICC decision... We cant see how they have put player safety as their No. 1 priority and this is very disappointing, Mills said.         
	Our recommendation to our players is not to travel to Pakistan at this point in time. There isnt one player I have spoken to who is comfortable about travelling to Pakistan at the moment, he added.         
	Mills urged New Zealand cricket to take a serious view of the security threat in Pakistan, saying it would be unfair for players to be asked to make individual decisions over whether to withdraw.         
	We have a number of young and fringe players in the team and they wont feel comfortable about opting out of the tour.         
	Its all right for the top five, six, seven players who are comfortable about their place in the side, he said.         
	A lot of the guys have strong views about not wanting to travel to Pakistan. We believe this needs to be a collective decision made by NZ cricket with our recommendation taken into account, he added.

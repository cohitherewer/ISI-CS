The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unconvincing win for Spain
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Unconvincing win for Spain
                      
	Santander: Midfielder Xavi scored a fine individual goal to earn Spain an unconvincing 1-0 win over US in their final Euro 2008 warm-up on Wednesday.         
	Spain dominated for long spells but found it difficult to break down a well-organised American defence.         
	The home team showed more urgency as the second half progressed and hit the woodwork twice before Xavi dribbled his way through a crowd of players to score the only goal with 12 minutes to go.         
	The victory extended Spains unbeaten run to 16 games. We suffered a lot in the first half but put them under more pressure in the second and found more spaces, Xavi told Spanish national television.         
	Coach Luis Aragones had expressed his annoyance at the soft goal conceded against Peru in last Saturdays 2-1 friendly win but stood by his back four of Sergio Ramos, Carlos Marchena, Carles Puyol and Joan Capdevila.         
	Andres Iniestas stomach upset gave Villarreals Santi Cazorla a place in the starting line up on the right of midfield.         
	Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas also started as Aragones reverted back to his 4-1-4-1 formation due to the bruised thigh that kept striker David Villa on the sidelines.         
	Fernando Torres shook off an ankle strain to play the lone striker role, but the home side were restricted to a Xavi header and a Torres snapshot in a disappointing first half.         
	Real Mallorcas Fernando Navarro won his first cap at left back, just after visiting striker Eddie Johnson had unsettled the Spain defence again, nipping in front of Marchena to head wide.

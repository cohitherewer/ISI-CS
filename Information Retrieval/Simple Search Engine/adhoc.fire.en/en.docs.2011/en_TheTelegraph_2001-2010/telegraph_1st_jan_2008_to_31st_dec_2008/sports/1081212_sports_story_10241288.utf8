            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Andrew Strauss after his century on Thursday                           
	Chennai: What had looked like a non-starter turned into a fascinating contest on the opening day of the India versus England Test series here at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Thursday. The Indian bowlers nullified the good work done by the England openers, to have the hosts clawing their way back into the match.         
	Andrew Strausss solid 123 provided the ideal platform for England but India made inroads in the last session. Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen were snapped up by Zaheer Khan while Paul Collingwood was the victim of a harsh decision from umpire Billy Bowden as the visitors slumped to 229 for five at stumps.         
	Harbhajan Singh also picked up two wickets with the pitch threatening to break. With some of the balls turning, jumping and skidding through, England are sure to find the going tough.         
	For the better part of a sun-baked day, the Indian bowlers seemed to reciprocate the generosity shown by the Englishmen in deciding to tour the country. It was only after tea that Zaheers reverse swing hit England hard.         
	Andrew Flintoff did well to survive  one delivery from Ishant Sharma hit him on the helmet  and Englands fortunes will largely revolve round his batting on the second day. Perhaps because of the stringent security, only a few thousand turned up for the match.         
	The Rapid Action Force, stationed along the periphery of the ground with guns and riot shields, were left staring blankly at the empty seats.         
	In memory of those who died during the Mumbai carnage, the players wore black armbands and observed a minutes silence before the start.         
	The adequate, if not overwhelming security, was not enough to prevent the batsmen form being jittery. Strauss and Alastair Cook pushed and prodded their way to only 63 in the first session. The precision and aggression that typified Indias bowling in the series against Australia was conspicuous by its absence. There was no effort to make things happen as the attack meandered from the ordinary to the pathetic.         
	Strauss and Cook justified Pietersens decision to bat first, showing immense concentration and application in stitching together the 118-run partnership. They frustrated the Indian bowlers by not taking any undue risk and being content with biding time.         
	As the pacers struggled to make an impact with the new ball on a slow pitch, Dhoni was forced to bring in Harbhajan Singh after just 37 minutes and eight overs. England targeted Amit Mishra, never allowing the leg-spinner to settle into a line and length. He, though, made amends with a brilliant caught and bowled dismissal of Strauss in the closing stages.         
	Strauss 13th century was a remarkable show of patience and a typical demonstration of his skills. There was no false stroke attempted during the 356 minutes (including 15 boundaries) he spent at the crease. Only Zaheers probing line troubled him on a couple of occasions. He used sweep as a regular option against the spinners, especially Mishra.         
	That he fell to the leg-spinner in the end is another matter. It was Zaheer who began the slide with the second ball after tea. The pacer didnt bowl in the second session but was lethal in his third spell (6-3-12-2).         
	The ball cut back and trapped Ian Bell right in front of the middle stump. The pacer then tested Pietersen to the hilt. Yuvraj Singhs left-arm spin also gave the England captain some discomforting moments. Finally, when Pietersen top edged a pull off Zaheer, he cursed himself for his own stupidity.         
	Collingwood was unlucky to say the least. The ball had missed his bat or gloves by at least a few inches as it brushed his pads on way to Gautam Gambhir at forward short leg. The use of technology could have saved the batsman.         
	Having collapsed from 164 for one, the English batsmen will have a lot of answering to do if the advantage is surrendered on Friday.

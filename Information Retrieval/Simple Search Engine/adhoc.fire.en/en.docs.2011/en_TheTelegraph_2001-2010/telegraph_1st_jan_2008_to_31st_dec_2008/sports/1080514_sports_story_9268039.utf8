The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Samuels banned for two years
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Samuels banned for two years
                      
	Dubai: West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels was banned from cricket for two years on Tuesday for breaking rules intended to prevent players from betting on matches. The ICC confirmed the automatic ban after receiving the judgment by the West Indies Cricket Boards disciplinary committee.         
	Samuels was allegedly recorded by Indian police as he passed on information to an Indian bookmaker during West Indies one-day series in the country.         
	Samuels denied giving out any information, but WICB found him guilty of contravening rules prohibiting a player from receiving any type of reward that could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute.         
	The 27-year-old Samuels was banned from May 9, 2008.         
	Corruption is a serious matter, acting ICC chief executive David Richardson said. Dealing with it effectively is fundamental to the integrity of our sport and this matter is a demonstration that its threat has not gone away.

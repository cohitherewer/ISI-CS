  - Williams sisters en route to familiar reunion       Oliver Brown            Serena Williams after her win on Monday                                 
	Sisters are doing it for themselves at this years Wimbledon, if only because everyone else in the womens draw appears incapable of mounting any resistance. Yes, Venus and Serena Williams are plotting an inexorable path to contest their first final at the All England Club for five years, even when the passage of time has dulled a little of their original lustre  both of them have, after all, won on Court No. 2 for their fourth-round matches on Monday, a setting known as the graveyard of champions.         
	Many of Wimbledons greatest players, Pete Sampras among them, have met their demise there and yet Venus and Serena faced no such trouble, there being so few players left to offer them a competitive match. It is an odd state of affairs magnified by the impression that neither of them is playing that well: Serena was taken to a first-round tie-break by Estonias Kaia Kanepi, while Venus was stretched by Anne Keothavong and Naomi Cavaday.         
	It seems doubly strange that commentators are extolling the depth in the womens game, after defeats for Ana Ivanovic and Maria Sharapova, when all signs point to a match-up between the duo whose power has prevailed for nearly a decade.         
	Certainly, the prospect of Venus versus Serena is not a nostalgia trip for which many will pine. There was the inescapable sense when the pair met on ladies final day in 2002 and 2003 that the raw spirit was being diluted by the sisterly alliance surveyed by father Richard, with his ever-present camera.         
	But the notion of a third act to this extraordinary family ritual is a throwback, suggestive of fundamental weaknesses among Ivanovic, Sharapova, Jelena Jankovic and all those pretenders who have subsequently tested the sisters dominance. Neither of their games has evolved. Venus depends on the athleticism borne of her remarkable body shape, where long levers propel destructive groundstrokes, while Serena often thrives by force alone. Still, a single-mindedness has underpinned their revival  Venus wins in 2005 and last year were widely regarded as triumphs over her poor injury record, while Serena has at last struck a balance between tennis and show business.         
	Venus, certainly, has no qualms about next Saturday becoming a familiar family affair indeed, she has never really doubted it. The chances were wonderful from the beginning, from round one; thats how we see it, she said.

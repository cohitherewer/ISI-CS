	Augusta: South African Trevor Immelman, finding his form after recovering from health problems last year, birdied the last two holes for a 68 to grab a one-shot lead in Fridays second round of the US Masters.         
	Immelman, overnight co-leader with Briton Justin Rose, matched his first-round score by posting three birdies on the back nine to reach eight-under-par 136 as he got hot with his putter on a warm, breezy day at Augusta National.         
	American Brandt Snedeker was alone in second place after he mirrored Immelmans rousing finish with birdies at 17 and 18 to complete a 68 for 137, two shots better than compatriots Phil Mickelson and Steve Flesch, and Briton Ian Poulter.         
	It feels great to break 70 both rounds, said Immelman, 28, who four months ago had a benign tumour the size of a golf ball removed from behind his rib cage and had previously lost more than 20 pounds due to an intestinal parasite. Its a thrill to play well here.         
	Four-time champion Tiger Woods was seven strokes off the pace after an up-and-down round of 71, while Rose plunged to a 78 thanks to a triple-bogey eight at the 15th hole in swirling winds that made it more difficult for the later starters.         
	Twice winner Mickelson had three birdies on the front side and capped a bogey-free round with a 30-foot birdie at 17 for a 68. At least Im working in the right direction but Ive got a long way to go, said Mickelson.         
	The cut was set at three over par, with 45 players qualifying for the final two rounds.         
	Among those at four-over were Ernie Els, Sergio Garcia and Fred Couples, who remains tied with Gary Player for a record for the most consecutive Masters cuts of 23.

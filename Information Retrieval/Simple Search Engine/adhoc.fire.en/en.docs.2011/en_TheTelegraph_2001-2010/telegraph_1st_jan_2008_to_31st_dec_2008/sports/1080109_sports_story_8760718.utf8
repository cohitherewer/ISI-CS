                                                Decision in best interests of the game, says Speed
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Malcolm Speed      
	Calcutta: The ICC on Tuesday dropped controversial West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor from the third Test  in Perth from January 16  and confirmed that Harbhajan Singh could play pending a decision on his three-Test ban.         
	The ICC replaced Bucknor with New Zealands Billy Bowden and brought in Chief Referee Ranjan Madugalle to assist in the process of ensuring that the match was played in the best possible spirit.         
	Bowden will stand in Perth alongside Pakistans Asad Rauf, who had already been appointed for the third Test. The fourth and final Test in Adelaide, from January 24, will also be umpired by Bowden and Rauf. It is accepted that Steve, and his on-field colleague Mark Benson, did not have a good game by their very high standards. We feel that given the added pressure and attention Steves presence would have at the third Test, it is better for the match and for Steve himself if he does not take part, said ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed.         
	It is important to stress that Steve has not been replaced due to any representations made by any team or individual. The decision by the ICC to replace Steve for this match was made in the best interests of the game and the series, Speed added.         
	We are bringing Ranjan in as a facilitator in an effort to prevent any ill-feeling that may have been present at the Sydney Test from rolling over to Perth, he said.

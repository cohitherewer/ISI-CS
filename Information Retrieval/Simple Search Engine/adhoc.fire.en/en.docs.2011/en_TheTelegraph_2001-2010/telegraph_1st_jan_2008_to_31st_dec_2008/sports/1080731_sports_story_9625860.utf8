            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: The jockey-turned-trainer Pesi Shroff didnt need divine intervention to win his first race at the RCTC ground but his horse Councilofthegods had other ideas. The less-fancied five-year-old led from the start to walk away with the 1,400m Supernova Cup, the main event in Wednesdays seven-event race card. Incidentally, the first four places in the race were occupised by the western India migrants, indicating the local challengers were hardly a match for them. Last seasons 2000 Guineas winner, Star Team, was the favourite in the race.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     New PCB chief in September
                      
	Karachi: The new chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will be appointed after the September election of the countrys new President following the resignation of Pervez Musharraf but an ad-hoc committee to clean-up the boards affairs will be in place within next few days.         
	Sports minister Najamuddin Khan on Sunday said the ad-hoc committee will be formed in next few days but just for three months while the replacement for Nasim Ashraf as the PCB chief would be named after the presidential election in early September.         
	The government had earlier mulled to appoint former Test player Ijaz Butt to replace Ashraf and forwarded his name after an approval by the Prime Minister but the move has been put on hold as the sports ministry decided to finalise a candidate only after the election of the President, who is the chief patron of the PCB.         
	The change in plan happened after the Presidents election was announced for early September, a well-placed source said. (AGENCIES)

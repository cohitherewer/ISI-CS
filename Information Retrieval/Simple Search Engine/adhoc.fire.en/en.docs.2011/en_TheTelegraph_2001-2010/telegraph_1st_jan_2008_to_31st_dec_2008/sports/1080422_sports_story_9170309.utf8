The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IHF secy steps down after sting operation
                                                                                                                                                                                                     IHF secy steps down after sting operation
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) secretary K. Jyothikumaran resigned on Monday after a news channel claimed to have done a sting operation in which he was shown receiving cash for including a player in the national team.         
	Jyothikumarans resignation came after Union sports minister M.S. Gill asked him to step down.         
	The shocking incident also brought into light the sharp division that exists within the IHF. While Jyothikumaran said he accepted money for hosting a tournament, president KPS Gill wasted no time in publicly condemning the secretary.         
	Gill and Jyothikumaran fell apart after Indias disastrous performance in the Olympic qualifiers in Santiago. The secretary, who failed in his attempt to remove national coach Joaquim Carvalho, was believed to be hatching a plot to oust K.P.S. Gill.         
	This is shameful, I have no words to condemn it, said the IHF president after the channels sting operation showed the secretary receiving a bribe of Rs 2 lakh. Jyothikumaran was promised another Rs 3 lakh to be handed over to his man in Delhi for getting a player selected for the Azlan Shah tournament.         
	K.P.S. Gill said Jyothikumaran has no right to remain the IHF secretary. Given the nature of his crime, he should not continue in his post, he said.         
	I was genuinely under the impression that a proposal for conducting a big tournament was being debated with me At no point of time did I raise anything about selection, Jyothikumaran later said.         
	The channel claimed that the bribe was given to him in Delhi in two instalments on April 10 and 11.         
	The channel alleged that a few days after receiving the money, the IHF secretary said the players name was included in the team for the Azlan Shah meet. According to the channel, it did not know the player and used the name only to make the entire investigation look real.         
	Highly placed sources said that such things have been going on in the IHF for many years. But they wondered how a player could be selected without the approval of the IHF president.         
	It is hard to believe that Gill was not aware of this, said an official. Both the president and the secretary sign the final list of players when it is submitted to the ministry, sources said.         
	A power tussle was going on for a long time between the president and the secretary in the IHF. This incident has only helped Gill to get rid of Jyothikumaran.         
	It is also unfortunate that a young player was made the scapegoat in the whole operation. The player in question is young and highly talented. He shouldnt have been dragged into it, the sources added.

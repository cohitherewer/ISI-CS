                                                   Bengal eves lose in semis

           
	Jaipur: Last years runners-up Kerala again set up a title clash against defending champions Railways at the 56th Senior National Womens Volleyball Championship on Monday. 
    
	In the semi-finals, the star-studded Railways earned a facile 3-0 victory against Tamil Nadu, while Kerala quelled Bengals challenge 3-1. 
    
	Kerala got a chance to avenge their defeat in last years final as they notched up a 25-16, 23-25, 25-14, 25-19 win against Bengal. 
    
	Riding on the performance of their star players, Railways had a clean sweep of 25-10, 25-17, 25-13 against Tamil Nadu. 
    
	Railways Vaishaly P fed the duo of Sapna Joshi and diminutive Preeti U Karta, who unleashed an array of powerful smashes to tear the Tamil Nadu defence apart. 
    
	A. Sindhu and C. S. Ramya did a good job for Tamil Nadu but could not stop the Railways progress. 
    
	The second semi-final was a close affair. Tiji Raju, Sumitha K. K, J. Aswani and S. Kumar helped Kerala to the hard-earned victory in the match that lasted over an hour. 
    
	Earlier, Services beat Karnataka to book the remaining semi-final berth in the mens event. (PTI)

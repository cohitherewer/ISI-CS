                                                   Shahid: Didnt think Id live to see this
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                                      Ashok Kumar and Vasudevan Baskaran      
	New Delhi: Indias failure to qualify for the Olympics for the first time in 80 years on Monday evoked strong reaction from the hockey fraternity. Former Olympians were united in their demand for a thorough overhaul of the system. The following are excerpts from what they had to say (in alphabetical order):         
	VASUDEVAN BASKARAN: Not involving technical advisor Ric Charlesworth in the team selection was the biggest blunder. His inputs would have been invaluable. I wonder how the Indians could earn so many yellow cards in a crucial match like this.         
	ASHOK KUMAR: The team wouldve been stronger had the coach picked Arjun Halappa and Sandeep Singh. Sandeeps presence would have helped us. Out of the 30 penalty corners that we managed to earn, we converted only 11 in the entire tournament. This was after the team underwent a special training camp for the drag-flickers.         
	JAGBIR SINGH: Lack of experienced players in the midfield proved costly. We know Vikram Pillai was not fully fit. Arjun Halappa should have been taken. A little more experience in the midfield would have helped us make a comeback after we were down 0-2. We didnt prepare well. We didnt play enough tournaments before the qualifiers.         
	MOHAMMED SHAHID: I couldnt believe my eyes when the match ended. I never thought I would live to see this day when there will be an Olympic without the Indian hockey team. We cant complain. Britain were deserving winners. They played much better than us. Our boys were nervous and couldnt fight back. The game in India has been killed systematically. I hope some good people come forward and do something drastic to bring back the glory days.         
	PARGAT SINGH: Its time the IHF office-bearers, including president K.P.S. Gill and secretary K. Jyothikumaran, take moral responsibility for the poor performance of the Indian hockey team in the Olympic qualifiers and immediately resign. It wasnt surprising that we failed to qualify. The way the IHF was functioning, this day had to come.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blast outside Gaddafi queers the tour pitch 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blast outside Gaddafi queers the tour pitch 
  - India in Pakistan 
  -   Possibility of reservations among players cant be ruled out         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni gets off the team bus at the National Stadium in Karachi, under heavy protection, during the Asia Cup earlier this year                                 
	Calcutta: Saturdays blast outside the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahores showpiece structure where the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is headquartered, may well have finished whatever chance there was of New Delhi giving permission for the January-February 2009 tour.         
	In fact, on Monday morning, a top Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official told The Telegraph: Frankly, at this moment, theres less than a one per cent chance of permission being granted There are many issues involved When hockeys junior team isnt allowed to visit Pakistan, its more or less assumed that a cricket tour would meet the same fate.         
	The official added: Right now, the BCCI isnt much in the picture as nothing can move till permission is given The government has more at stake than us.         
	While the official didnt elaborate, he probably had the upcoming general elections in mind.         
	Clearly, if permission is granted and an unfortunate incident does take place, then the Opposition could be handed a major poll issue.         
	New Delhi has said it intends sending a security team for a recce (as was done before the 2003-04 and 2005-06 trips), but nothing had been finalised till Monday evening.         
	Significantly, the official indicated that the BCCI would have a dialogue with the players and the support staff even if permission was forthcoming.         
	The support staff includes foreigners.         
	Sadly, the Sachin Tendulkars dont have a players body on the lines of the Australian Cricketers Association. So, if somebody does have reservations over touring Pakistan (such a possibility cant be ruled out), then that would have to be conveyed personally.         
	A body like the one in Australia would have kept the Tendulkars out of the firing line, with top office-bearers (and not players) dealing with the BCCI.         
	The Indian Cricket Players Association did come into being in October 2002, and was supposed to be an improvement on an earlier flop show, but it has done nothing except to organise a couple of fund-raisers.         
	Worse, its not recognised by the BCCI.         
	The PCB is, of course, hopeful that the tour would take place. At the same time, being realistic, its looking at options: Either to request the BCCI for a swap (with the PCB playing host in 2010) or shift the matches to a neutral venue.         
	A three-day game, three Tests, five ODIs and a Twenty20 match have been scheduled between January 4-February 19.

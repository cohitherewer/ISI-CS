                                                   Arun to have stint with Whatmore

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: In a surprising development, Bengal coach Bharat Arun has taken up a role with the National Cricket Academy (NCA), fuelling speculation that he may leave his current assignment. 
    
	Even as the Chennai-based Arun assured the CAB that he would join the squad on Wednesday and would be there for long time discussing what went wrong. 
    
	The 45-year-old former India player will work in tandem with Dav Whatmore for Womens Level-A coaching course from January 28-February 5. In the faculty, Arun will be bowling coach, while NCA director of operations Whatmore will look after the batting aspect. Dinesh Nanavati (fielding) and Kinjal Suratwala (sports science) are the other two to assist. 
    
	Arun will be one of the faculty members, Suratwala told The Telegraph. Arun however ruled out this development and said he had not received any information in this regard. Though anything comes up I may join (NCA) for three days, he said. 
    
	However sources at the NCA revealed that Arun was not keen on continuing with Bengal especially after the teams pathetic performance this season. After the womens programme, a Level III course is on the cards And now after Whatmores appointment, NCA is planning to hire coaches for full-time. 
    
	Asked about the development, CAB joint secretary Samar Paul said the association had no problem Arun joining NCA in his free time. But hes not breaching his (CAB) contract, he added.

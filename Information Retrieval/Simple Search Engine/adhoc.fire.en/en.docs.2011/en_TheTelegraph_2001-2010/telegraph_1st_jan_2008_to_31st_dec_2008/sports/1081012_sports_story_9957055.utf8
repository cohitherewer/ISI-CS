	Ludhiana: Scoring once in each half, JCT defeated Mohammedan Sporting 2-0 in the third round of the ONGC I-League match played at the Guru Nanak Stadium here on Saturday.         
	With this victory, JCT took their tally to seven points and climbed to second place after three matches while the visitors slipped to ninth place with just one point from as many matches.         
	JCT opened the account following an opportunistic strike by Baljit Sahni a few seconds before half time. Brazilian forward Eduardo Da Silva doubled the lead in the 66th minute.         
	Meanwhile, in an all Mumbai showdown, Mumbai FC continued their glorious run scoring an upset victory over Durand Cup winners Mahindra United by a solitary goal at the Cooperage football ground.         
	The match-winner was scored in the 23rd minute by K Kulothungan from close range off a cross from Subhas Chakraborty. This was Mahindras third loss in a row, while Mumbai FC are now on nine points.

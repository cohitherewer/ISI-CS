                                                    Ponting: Too early to 
 say we are declining

	Adelaide: Australian skipper Ricky Ponting on Wednesday said it was too early to declare his team a declining force. He warned critics not to rush to a judgement about the slipping crown of the world champions after the defeat against India in Perth. 
    
	I think one loss is probably a little bit early to be saying that this team is on the slide. We have had it before. 
    
	We had it before the World Cup, eight or 12 months ago now, we went through the World Cup undefeated, Ponting said. 
    
	We have just gone 16 Tests in a row It has only been done once before by another Australian team. I dont think we have too much to worry about just yet, he added. 
    
	Ponting refused to divulge details about the Australian team composition for the fourth and final Test and said he was still to make up his mind on whether to persist with pacer Shaun Tait or bring back spinner Brad Hogg. 
    
	We just have to toss up in our head whether spin is the way to go or do we try and use pace with variable bounce late in the game, he said. 
    
	I think historically spin has probably been the preferred option for the Australian team to play in most conditions around the world. 
    
	But when you have someone like Taity  a wicket-taker like that in the room as well, it gives you lots of options but makes your decision very difficult as well, he added. 
    
	But if spin is to be Pontings option, the Australian skipper said he would try not to put too much pressure on Hogg. 
    
	Ponting called upon his team to show character and bounce back after the loss at the Waca. 
    
	I think individuals rebounding from personal failure is always a good character judgement of an individual so I guess the same could be said for a team. 
    
	Thats basically all I have said to the guys this week We were always going to lose a game at some stage but its about how you bounce back and back your own skills and judgements as a result of a loss (which is important), he said. 
    
	Ponting said his team has identified the areas in which it lacked in Perth. 
    
	I dont think any of our guys have gone away and sat down and over-analysed things too much. We have addressed areas where we didnt play well, he said. 
    
	You will see us come out and be very aggressive and very positive and really try and force the issue in this game, he added. 
    
	The skipper, however, made it clear that Australia would not compromise on the essential nature of their aggressive style of play. 
    
	One thing I stressed was that I didnt want our style of game of cricket to change whatsoever. 
    
	We only know one way to play and thats not a result of playing cricket for Australia, he said. 
    
	Thats a result of growing up playing cricket in Australia, in club cricket, in state cricket you learn about the way to play the game.

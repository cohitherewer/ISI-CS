	Melbourne: Second seed Rafael Nadal eased into the Australian Open quarter finals when Paul-Henri Mathieu retired with a left calf muscle injury in the second set of their fourth-round match on Sunday. 
    
	The Spaniard was leading 6-4, 3-0 when the Frenchman, who had earlier had treatment on the leg, was forced to quit. 
    
	Its a little disappointing because I was playing a great match, Nadal told reporters. I felt my best today, but I cant be (that) disappointed because I am in the quarter finals. 
    
	Nadal will play Finlands Jarkko Nieminen, the 24th seed, in the last eight, a player he has beaten all three times they have met. Nieminen beat German Philipp Kohlschreiber 3-6, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (9), 6-3. 
    
	Earlier on Sunday, Justine Henin and Maria Sharapova set up an explosive quarter final with crushing wins but mens fourth seed Nikolay Davydenkos title hopes fizzled out at a drizzly Melbourne Park. 
    
	Davydenko was given a 7-6, 6-3, 6-1 thrashing by 14th-seed and fellow-Russian Mikhail Youzhny. 
    
	David Nalbandian, seeded 10th, was also on the wrong end of a pasting, losing 1-6, 2-6, 3-6 to Spains Juan Carlos Ferrero in a third-round match held over from Saturday. 
    
	Third seed Jelena Jankovic advanced safely, however, ending the dream run of home hope Casey Dellacqua with a 7-6, 6-1 win in the first match of the night session. 
    
	Ferrero and Nalbandian took up residence on Centre Court at 11am, just six-and-a-half hours after the end of Lleyton Hewitts epic five-set victory over Marcos Baghdatis. That ended at 4:33am after four hours and 45 minutes of see-saw action. 
    
	Ferrero next plays compatriot and near namesake David Ferrer for a place in the quarter finals. The fifth seed swatted aside American Vince Spadea 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. 
    
	Youzhny next faces Jo-Wilfried Tsonga who beat fellow-Frenchman and doubles partner Richard Gasquet 6-2, 6-7, 7-6, 6-3. 
    
	World No. 1 Henin breezed past Chinese Taipeis Hsieh Su-wei 6-2, 6-2 to book her place in the last eight. 
    
	Fifth seed Sharapova sparkled on the Vodafone Arena, pummelling 11th-seeded fellow-Russian Elena Dementieva for the loss of just two games. 
    
	Champion Serena Williams posted a solid 6-3, 6-4 win over Czech Nicole Vaidisova and next plays Jankovic. 
    
	In womens third-round matches carried over from Saturday, No. 9 Daniela Hantuchova beat Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-2, 6-3, No. 14 Nadia Petrova defeated Ekaterina Makarova 6-1, 7-6 (8), and Marta Domachowska overcame Chinas Li Na 2-6, 6-2, 6-4.

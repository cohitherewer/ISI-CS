                                                     Hansen to hear Bhajji appeal

   A STAFF REPORTER
   
	Calcutta: The ICC has appointed Justice John Hansen to hear Harbhajan Singhs appeal. The Indian off-spinner has been slapped a three-Test ban by Match Referee Mike Procter who found him guilty of making a racist remark atAustralia allrounder Andrew Symonds during the second Test in Sydney.
 
	Justice Hansen is a high court judge in New Zealand and is New Zealand Crickets representative on the ICCs Code of Conduct Commission.
 
	According to a media release, the ICC received the official notification of the appeal from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Monday and the ICC Senior Counsel and Company Secretary Urvasi Naidoo appointed Justice Hansen on Wednesday, in line with the ICC Code of Conduct process. Justice Hansen will now make preparations for the hearing.
 
	No time, date or venue for the appeal has yet been fixed. 
 
	The process indicates that the appeal should be heard within seven days of the commissioner being appointed. However, this time period may be extended if circumstances so dictate.
 
	The charge against Harbhajan was laid by the two umpires after the close of play on Day III of the second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground following a complaint they received from the Australia captain Ricky Ponting.
 
	The complaint was made by Ponting after the 116th over of Indias first innings, prior to which Harbhajan is alleged to have made a racist comment directed at Symonds.
 
	The Code of Conduct hearing was conducted by Procter after the Test concluded on Sunday (January 6). Harbhajan pleaded not guilty to the charge, but Procter was not convinced and imposed a ban of three Tests on the Indian.
 
	Under the provisions of the ICC Code of Conduct, Justice Hansen has the power to increase, decrease, amend or otherwise substitute his own decision from that made at the previous hearing. His decision will be final and binding.
 
	Once Justice Hansen has reached his decision, he must provide it in writing to Naidoo, who will then forward it to Harbhajan, Procter and ICC Chief Executive Officer Malcolm Speed ahead of any public announcement.
 
	According to the Code of Conduct regulations, Harbhajan may continue till the verdict has been announced.

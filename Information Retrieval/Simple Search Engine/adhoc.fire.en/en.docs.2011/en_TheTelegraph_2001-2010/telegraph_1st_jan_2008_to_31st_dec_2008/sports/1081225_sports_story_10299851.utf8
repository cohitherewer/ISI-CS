The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pujara to seek Dravid tips
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pujara to seek Dravid tips
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Pujara                           
	Mumbai: The latest bird to take wings wants to learn more about high flying from the seasoned eagle. Well, how else would one put in words the image of Cheteshwar Pujara, the newest run-making machine on the domestic circuit, seeking batting tips from Rahul The Wall Dravid?         
	I am looking forward to having a discussion with Dravid. There are a lot of things related to cricket and batting that one can ask him, the prolific Pujara told reporters on Wednesday. I want to speak to him and find out about the difference between domestic and international cricket. His technique and determination are two things that I like the most in him.         
	The Saurashtra batsman will be playing the Ranji Trophy quarter finals against Karnataka starting on Friday at the Brabourne stadium. Dravid will be representing his state side, having flown in from Mohali, venue of the second Test against England, Wednesday evening.         
	Over the next five days, Pujara should find ample time to fulfil his wish. Not that there was any major scope for improvement in his batting.         
	The 20-year-old topped the batting charts last season with 807 runs and began the current season with a bang, scoring three triple centuries in a row  two in the CK Nayudu Trophy under-22 tournament and one against Orissa in the Ranji Trophy.         
	In fact, his penchant for runs stretches back to his early teens when he scored a triple in an under-14 match, and hit a double for the India u-19s against England.         
	I interacted with Dravid at the NCA and during a Ranji match at Rajkot two years ago. He told me to score as many runs as possible. Now I want to know about preparation, Pujara said.

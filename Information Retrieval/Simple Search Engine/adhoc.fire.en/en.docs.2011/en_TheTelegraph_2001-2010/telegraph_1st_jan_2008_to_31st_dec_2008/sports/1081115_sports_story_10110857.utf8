The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB offer
                                                                                                                                                                                                     PCB offer
                      
	Karachi: Desperate to host Mahendra Singh Dhonis men next year, PCB chairman Ejaz Butt is willing to travel to India to ease the security concerns of the BCCI and the Indian government.         
	Butt insisted that the PCB has no plans to shift the series to a neutral venue as of now and such an option would be considered only in extreme circumstances.         
	We are not even thinking about having the series anywhere else except Pakistan. Playing at some neutral venue is an extreme and last option, Butt said from Abu Dhabi where Pakistan is playing a one-day series against West Indies.         
	If need arises I will even travel to India to personally talk to the Indian board and government and convince them it is absolutely imperative for them to undertake the scheduled tour, he added.         
	India are scheduled to tour Pakistan in January and February to play three Tests, five ODIs and a Twenty20 game.         
	Former captain Ramiz Raja has urged India to send its cricket team to Pakistan, saying the two countries need each others backing. Ramiz believed the security situation was acceptable.         
	I see it as a tough situation for not only Pakistan but for world cricket but frankly speaking the security situation in major Pakistan cities like Lahore and Karachi is not that bad, Raja said.

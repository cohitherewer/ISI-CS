The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India play Nepal today
                                                                                                                                                                                                       India play Nepal today
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: Defending champions India will play their first competitive international tie in nine months when they take on Nepal in the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Cup at the National Stadium in Male on Tuesday.         
	On August 29 last year, Bob Houghtons boys created history when they clinched the Nehru Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium in Delhi. Sadly, the euphoria over Indian soccers new dawn didnt last long as Bhaichung Bhutia and his teammates got back into the busy schedule of domestic football. They never got another chance to renew their battle on the international stage.         
	On Tuesday India, embarrassingly placed 151 in the Fifa rankings, will have to start all over again against teams who are far below them in the international ladder. Nepal, ranked 184, are no better but have a history of troubling India in the South East Asian meets.         
	As skipper Bhaichung Bhutia put it, SAFF Cup is a loss-loss situation for India. You dont get any credit for winning the SAFF Cup. But a defeat here would invite sharp criticism. The critics would call for our heads. One has to be extra careful while playing in this tournament.         
	Coach Bob Houghton also knows it well and hasnt made too many changes from the team that played in the Nehru Cup. Yet, he has a problem in hand as some of his key players have suffered injuries in the run up to the tournament.         
	Houghtons biggest loss is the loss of Surkumar Singh in the defence. With the Manipuri out of the squad after suffering a hamstring injury in the friendly match against Chinese Taipei in Chennai, Houghton is likely to draft in stopper back Dipak Mondal to the right-back position with NS Manju getting shifted to the other side.         
	With Subrata Paul an automatic choice under the bar, seasoned Mahesh Gawli and Gourmangi Singh are most likely to fill in the two places in the stopper back positions. While Steven Dias, N.P. Pradeep, Climax Lawrence and Rennedy Singh will be the four midfielders, Bhaichung and Sunil Chetri will stay upfront.

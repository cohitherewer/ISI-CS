The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beckham musical set for West End debut
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Beckham musical set for West End debut
            HENRY WINTER            David Beckham                           
	Such is old Goldenballss phenomenal appeal to the public that a librettist is talking to West End producers this week about staging a musical entitled David Beckham  The Theatre of Dreams.         
	Beckhams story is a modern-day fairytale of heroes, villains, love, Manchester United and what it means to lead your country, explained Mark Archer, the songwriter behind this celebration of Beckhams first 33 years. His rise from obscurity to international stardom, his universally acknowledged gifts as a supreme sportsman, and his Hollywood lifestyle all have the elements of an aspirational fable.         
	With football and celebrity now firmly established as new secular Western religions, The Theatre of Dreams is set within a cheering football stadium  the modern-day church. The music is powerful, gospel-like rock to establish clearly football and Manchester United as a religion.         
	The Lion King himself was in more athletic rehearsals in London on Monday, polishing his lines under demanding Italian impresario, Fabio Capello, before Thursdays show for England against the Czech Republic at Wembley.         
	Still not believing that England are too one-dimensional with the one-paced Beckham, Capello will continue to give him a starring role on the right. Say what you like about Beckham, and no English sportsman stirs more comment, but he enjoys a longevity of Mousetrap proportions. When the England starting XI is announced on Thursday, no name will elicit louder cheers than Beckham.         
	Even Wayne Rooney remains in his shadow. England supporters adore Beckham because he has fought back from adversity (St-Etienne against Argentina), rescued the team (Old Trafford against Greece) and shown he cares about the shirt. His tears on turning in the armband after the 2006 World Cup were genuine.         
	Throw in the sub-plots of a glamorous spouse (Posh Spice), the reported tensions with his father (Ted Beckham) and father figure (Sir Alex Ferguson) and the stage represents a natural home for a man now based in Hollywood.         
	With half the world supporting United and the rest worshipping Beckham, a musical about the iconic life of the Beckhams would be certain to attract huge attention, Archer added.         
	The musical begins with such songs as The Promised Land, detailing Fergusons desire to revive United and Beckhams emergence.

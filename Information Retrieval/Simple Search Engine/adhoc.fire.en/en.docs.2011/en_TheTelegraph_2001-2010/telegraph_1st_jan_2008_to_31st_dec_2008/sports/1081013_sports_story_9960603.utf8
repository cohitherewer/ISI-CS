                                                                                                                                                                                           Fisichella, Sutil fail to finish
                      
	Fuji: The Japanese Grand Prix ended in sheer disappointment for Force India as both Giancarlo Fisichella and Adrian Sutil failed to finish their race owing to car problems on Sunday.         
	Fisichella crashed out following a gearbox problem, while a tyre puncture ended Sutils challenge. This is the sixth time in the season that both cars have failed to finish the race together.         
	Sutil and Fisichella made electric starts from their respective positions of 19th and 20th on the grid only to fizzle out within 30 minutes.         
	Sutil even moved up to 10th position before a sudden tyre failure on lap nine, forcing early retirement.         
	Fisichella too pushed through the field and was enjoying a tight battle with the Williams of Rosberg for the 12th position. His race though met the same fate following a problem with the gearbox of his VJM01 on lap 21.

                                                   Dalmiyas day at the Eden

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: The wait got over at 4.48pm, 10 minutes after Prasun Mukherjee made his way into the Eden. Jagmohan Dalmiya, in an ivory safari, made his first appearance at what was once considered his second home, more than a year after he resigned from the presidents post. 
    
	He got off at the gate, slowly walked down the porch to the main entrance only to be mobbed by TV cameras before taking the elevator to the second floor conference room. 
    
	Jaguda kemon achen, youre looking very fresh, nice to see you again, the pleasantries from well wishers didnt seem to end. He greeted all with a refreshing smile. Even the current president was waiting for him in the lobby. Mukherjee greeted him with a warm hug and the two were engrossed in a discussion for the few minutes. 
    
	As the special general meeting began, Mukherjee briefed the members and then asked his predecessor to make his point. Dalmiya spoke softly for around 40 minutes in two spells and held the house spellbound. No one dared to interfere or challenge any of his arguments. 
    
	Im not here to fight but to sort out things If someone pushes you to the wall, youve got to fight it out, Dalmiya said later. 
    
	Once the meeting got over, Mukherjee was there to see him off. Can this be treated as a prelude to the AGM in July? Has Mukherjee averted the crisis? The questions were overflowing but Dalmiya tried to brush the issue aside with a wave of his hands. 
    
	Was Dalmiya a little circumspect and subdued in his approach? When you take the crease after a year, youre bound to be cautious and uncertain in the first hour. Youre not sure where your off stump is But once you settle down, things will fall into place. The same applies here, said a trusted lieutenant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak aim to extend winning streak

	Dhaka: Pakistan would look to stretch their unbeaten streak of 11 matches when they clash against Bangladesh in the triangular series opener on Sunday.         
	Led by Shoaib Malik, Pakistan had whitewashed Bangladesh 5-0 at home in April and look certain to assert their dominance though Malik termed the hosts as tough customers on their home-grounds.         
	In home conditions they are a lot better side and we got to be careful about that. I want to win the first game, which would definitely raise our confidence level, Malik said on Saturday.         
	Bangladesh need to raise their game if they dream of upsetting their formidable rivals in the tri-series.         
	The hosts performance would depend largely on skipper Mohammed Ashraful and the top-order, which has been strengthened by the addition of wicketkeeper batsman Mushafiqur Rahim.         
	We have put the past performances as history. We are now fully focused towards performing well first in the tri-series and then take the success to the Asia Cup in Pakistan, Ashraful said.         
	We have the best of 14 players available in Bangladesh. Our confidence levels are high since we are playing at home and hopefully we will beat Pakistan before taking India in the next match, he added.         
	If their top-five batsmen could fire they can make a fight out of it. However, it would be an enormous task for their bowlers to contain the Pakistan batting lineup studded with Salman Butt at the top and Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf in the middle apart from hard hitters in Misbah-ul-Haq and Shahid Afridi.         
	The hosts have dropped Junaid Siddque in favour of uncapped fast bowler Dolar Mahmud.         
	Pakistan have a good attack even without detained Mohammed Asif and banned Shoaib Akhtar as Sohail Tanvir, highest wicket taker in the inaugural Indian Premier League, provides enough sting and potency to it.         
	Umar Gul is equally effective and Bazid Khan and Wahab Riaz give options to skipper Malik to field a balanced attack.         
	Every encounter assumes significance as only one league match against each side makes the win important and it plays a role in gaining a strong net run-rate, which may become crucial as the tournament progresses.         
	And looking at the strengths and weaknesses of both the teams, Pakistan undoubtedly start as favourite.

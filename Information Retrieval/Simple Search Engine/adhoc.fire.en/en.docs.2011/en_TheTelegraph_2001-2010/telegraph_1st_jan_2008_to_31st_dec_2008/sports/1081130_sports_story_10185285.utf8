The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal pacers too hot for Tripura to handle
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bengal pacers too hot for Tripura to handle
  - Ranadeb picks up five to join 200-club in Ranji Trophy       A STAFF REPORTER            Ranadeb Bose at the Eden on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Bengal skittled out Tripura for a paltry 88, courtesy fiery fast bowling from the pacers, and then returned to take a 50-run lead by the end of first days play in the Ranji Trophy Plate Group B match at the Eden.         
	That morning shows the day was made evident on Saturday morning when Bengal pacer Ranadeb Bose, operating from the High Court end, trapped Tripura opener Rajib Saha in front of the wicket with the very first delivery of the match.         
	The dismissal set the tone for Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Co. as the hosts cut short minnows Tripuras first innings within 26.5 overs with Ranadeb picking up five wickets.         
	Ashok Dinda and Sourav Sarkar, the other medium pacers in the team, claimed three and two wickets respectively. Ranadeb, with his five-wicket haul, reached the 200-wicket club in Ranji Trophy.         
	In reply, Bengal, after suffering early hiccups, steadied their innings  thanks to a timely 133-run unbroken third wicket partnership between Manoj Tiwary (82 batting) and Arindam Ghosh (47 batting). The umpires called off the days play early owing to bad light.         
	The visitors surprise decision to bat first, after wining the toss, helped Bengal put Tripura on the mat.         
	Ranadeb started from exactly where he left off in Bengals last match against Services. He was apt with his line and length and grabbed his second wicket in the fourth over of the day. A good catch by wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha sent the other opener Biswajit Dey (1) back to the pavilion.         
	Ranadeb then claimed Timir Chandas (13) wicket to take his third and the visitors were reduced to 24 for three. Tripura looked helpless against Bengals pace attack throughout their innings.         
	Dinda, who bowled 13 overs at a stretch, was pretty mediocre in the initial overs. However, egged on by his partner Ranadebs spirited show, he came back strongly when Abhijit Dey nicked one to Anustup Majumdar. Nishit Shetty (38) followed next in the same manner.         
	Shetty was the lone Tripura batsman to offer some resistance. Rajib Datta became Dindas third victim.         
	Ranadeb became the second Bengal pacer after Subroto Guha to reach the 200-wicket mark in Ranji Trophy. His figures read 9-4-19-5.         
	Sarkar scalped two by removing the tail-enders.         
	Rohan Banerjee, last matchs hero, failed to maintain the momentum and was back in the pavilion in the very first over without scoring.         
	A shaky Anustup was soon back after Timir Chanda uprooted his stumps, with five overs left for the lunch break.         
	Manoj and Arindam then stitched together a partnership and at tea Bengal were 76 for two.         
	Manoj played a cautious innings while hitting seven boundaries during his 163-ball knock. When on 69, he was caught at second slip off a no ball by Timir Chanda.

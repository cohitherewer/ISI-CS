                                                   Dynamos win first final 

           
	Chandigarh: Local favourites Chandigarh Dynamos pipped Bangalore Hi-Fliers 3-2 in the first of the best-of-three-finals to move a step closer to the Premier Hockey League title on Monday. 
    
	Sher Singh (second minute), Rajpal Singh (seventh) and Deepak Thakur (37th) struck a goal each for Dynamos, while Sandeep Michael (13th) and Hari Prasad (69th) hit home for the Hi-Fliers at the Sector 42 Stadium. 
    
	The Dynamos played better than what the scoreline suggested and maintained an upper hand for a major part of the match. The action-packed first quarter saw three goals as Chandigarh Dynamos seized the initiative by slamming two goals in the first seven minutes. 
    
	A fiery slapshot from Sandeep Singh was flicked in by an alert Sher Singh to leave the Hi-Fliers dumbfounded. 
    
	Five minutes later, Rajpal shot home a spectacular goal. After dribbling past two defenders from the right, the Dynamos captain used the reverse stick to double the lead. 
    
	Hi-Fliers reduced the margin through a beautiful field goal. Ace forward Thakur restored the two-goal lead for the local side in the third quarter. 
    
	 With the clock ticking fast, Hi-Fliers managed a consolation with Hari Prasads fluke goal. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McGain out of first Test
                                                                                                                                                                                                     McGain out of first Test
                            
	Hyderabad: Australias already depleted spin attack lost more sting Wednesday with leg-spinner Bryce McGain ruled out of the first Test against India due to a shoulder injury.         
	The 36-year-old picked up the injury while touring India with the Australia A side last month and developed a sore shoulder after Tuesdays practice.         
	His injury, which makes him a doubtful starter for the second Test as well, virtually clears the deck for 25-year-old off-spinner Jason Krejzas Test debut in Bangalore.         
	McGain is not fit. He pulled up sore on Tuesday and his injury is being assessed, Aussie coach Tim Nielsen said.         
	The physio will take a call in the next 24 hours but he is definitely going to miss the warm-up match here and most probably the first Test as well, he said.         
	Sources said the back injury would require at least two weeks rest and McGain might miss the second Test as well.         
	We will have to talk to the selectors as well. For if another player gets injured, we might have to rush in substitutes, he said.         
	The Australian coach said McGains injury provides Krejza a gilt-edged opportunity to prove his mettle and the youngster was up to the challenge.           (PTI)

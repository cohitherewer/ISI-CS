                                                   Poised for a thrilling finish 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	New Delhi: The inaugural ONGC I-League is set for a thrilling finish on Saturday as there are three teams in contention for the title.         
	Both Dempo, who won the National Football League last year, and Churchill Brothers have 33 points each but the defending champions are sitting at the top because of a superior goal average.         
	While Dempo have a goal difference of plus 19, two-time runners-up Churchill Brothers are four goals behind.         
	JCT, frontrunners at the start of the I-League, also have an outside chance of winning the title. For that to happen, both Dempo and Churchill will have to lose their respective matches and JCT will have to defeat Salgaocar by a big margin.         
	But Dempo have their own share of worries since they are playing away against Viva Kerala. Both their strikers  Ranty Martins and Edeh Chidi  are in awful form and the team has picked a disappointing tally of six points in the last six matches.         
	Defying medical advice, Dempo coach Armando Colaco travelled to Calicut for his teams title-deciding encounter.         
	Still on crutches, Colaco is determined to make his presence felt for the final round battle. With so much at stake, I couldnt keep myself at home, he said.         
	The Dempo coach said he was not unduly bothered about what the result between Churchill Brothers and Air India. Why should I keep my ears open to whats happening in Margao? Unlike other teams, our fate is in our own hands. We need to come good for one last time.         
	In Mumbai, Mohun Bagan will face Mahindra United, though both teams are no longer in the title hunt.         
	East Bengal, having already saved the relegation, will have pride at stake when they host Sporting Clube de Goa at the Barasat stadium.

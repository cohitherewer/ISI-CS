            A STAFF REPORTER             Yakubu is all smiles after Mahindras win over East Bengal in Barasat on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                           
	Calcutta: East Bengal, the IFA Shields most successful team, are facing elimination from the century-old tournament after just one match.         
	Mahindra United whipped East Bengal 2-0 at the Barasat stadium on Saturday, leaving the 27-time champions with an uphill task in their final group match against South Africas Santos FC.         
	Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu scored a sensational goal and set up another for Mohammed Rafi in quick succession in the first half, brightening the Mumbai outfits prospects of making the semi-finals despite their 0-2 loss to Santos in the opening match. As things stand now, the home favourites must beat the South Africans at least by a margin of three goals on Monday  an effort which looks unlikely, going by their performance on Saturday.         
	East Bengal started on a positive note with debutant and Yakubus countrymate, Abeku Gaisy, and Brazilian Edmilson testing goalkeeper Sandip Nandy on a couple of occasions. Edmilson, in fact, misfired a kick with Nandy standing at his mercy.         
	Mahindra, on the back of passing football, regrouped slowly, waiting for East Bengals initial bursts to fade. Yakubu then took centre stage and almost single-handedly changed the complexion of the game.         
	The first goal came in the 37th minute, Yakubus through finding Rafi clear on the left. The Keralite outwitted and out-ran East Bengal defender M. Bolaji with ease to enter into the box and then placed the ball in perfectly to the left of Subrata Pauls diving hands.         
	The goal of the match  which will perhaps make the top three in Indian football this season  came six minutes later. When Yakubu got the ball near East Bengals half-line, as many as six rival players were in front of him. The Ghanaians magical journey began with dodging past Mehtab Hussain and Jayanta Sen with his first couple of touches. Then a sudden burst of speed saw him steer clear of Anupam Sarkar and with Mehrajuddin Wadao coming to challenge, he cooly squared the ball to the unmarked Rafi at the other end.         
	Rafi quickly sent in a perfect cross for Yakubu to head home. It took 12 seconds for the Ghanaian to spell the magic, and cheers from the home supporters only confirmed how much they liked it.         
	Interim coach Aloke Mukherjee suffered another blow when Edmilson asked for relief from duty due to an ankle injury. The former India left-back reshuffled his team in the second half, bringing M. Suresh at the back, pushing Mehrajuddin in the midfield and Nabi to pair up with Gaisy.         
	But Mahindra never allowed their rivals to stage a comeback. In fact, only an alert Suresh and brave Paul saved their team more blushes, denying Ivorian Douhou Pierre and Rafi.

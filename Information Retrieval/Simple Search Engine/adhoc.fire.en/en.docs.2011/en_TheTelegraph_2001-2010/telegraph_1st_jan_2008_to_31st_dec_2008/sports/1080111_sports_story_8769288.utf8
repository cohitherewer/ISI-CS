                                                   Lawson seeks psychologist

           
	Karachi: Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson wants to bring in a sports psychologist for his players. I have made some recommendations to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and one of those is to have a sports psychologist with the team, he said. 
    
	The PCB told Lawson it expected him to get more out of the team. 
    
	I agree it is the job of the coach to make the team work, said Lawson on Thursday after returning from holiday in Australia. I am in charge but I need professional help to assist me. 
    
	There is a lot of history between the two teams and it is not just about the Sydney Test, he said. A lot of things led to the problems. 
    
	But there is greater responsibility on the captains to control their players and avoid such situations. 
    
	Also, contrary to what the PCB thinks of Shoaib Akhtars on and off-field antics, Lawson did not find anything wrong in his behaviour during the recent tour of India.

                                                   Douglas ruled out

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will miss out on Douglas da Silva when they take on Salgaocar SC in their Round XV encounter of the ONGC I-League at Salt Lake Stadium Monday. 
    
	The Brazilian defender sustained a hamstring injury in Mohun Bagans last outing against Chruchill Brothers on Thursday. In his absence, Mohun Bagan are likely to field N.S. Manju, Rauf Khan, Habibur Rehman Mondal and Subhasish Roy Chowdhury in the defensive line-up. 
    
	With Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto in full flow, the green-and-maroons are keen on getting full points to add to their tally of 24 points. Salgaocar on the other hand will be more than happy to dish out a draw. 
    
	Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Periera said: We are playing some good football and we hope to continue the momentum. 
    
	The Goans are reeling with seven points after 14 matches.

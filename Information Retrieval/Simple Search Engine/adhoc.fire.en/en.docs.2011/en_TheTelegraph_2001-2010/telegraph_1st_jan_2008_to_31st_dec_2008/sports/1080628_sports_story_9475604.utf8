                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ive learnt a lesson, says Harbhajan
                  Harbhajan Singh                     
	New Delhi: Harbhajan Singh admitted on Friday that he erred in slapping Team India teammate Sreesanth but said he has learnt a lesson from the entire episode. He hoped that his volatile temper wont get the better of him in the future.         
	Currently serving a five-ODI suspension, Harbhajan said to err is human and he was no exception. There are lot of things that I would have done differently. But we are all human beings and make mistakes. And we learn from our mistakes too. But yes, mera gussa kamega to bahot kuchch solve ho jayega (curbing temper would solve most of my problems, the belligerent off-spinner told a television channel.         
	Harbhajan slapped Sreesanth in the April 25 match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab, following which he was banned from playing in the IPL, which cost him Rs 3 crore. I dont plan to get into trouble. Im very passionate, Harbhajan said.         
	Wiser after the incident, the Punjab spinner now sees the episode as a lesson for him.         
	Jo hota hai, achhe ke liye hi hota hai. Yeh sab nahi hota to sikhne ka mauka bhi nahi hota. Yeh sab bhagwan ke sikhane ka tarika hota hai (whatever happens, happens for good. Had this not happened, I would not have learnt all these things. I guess it was gods way of teaching me the lesson, Harbhajan said.

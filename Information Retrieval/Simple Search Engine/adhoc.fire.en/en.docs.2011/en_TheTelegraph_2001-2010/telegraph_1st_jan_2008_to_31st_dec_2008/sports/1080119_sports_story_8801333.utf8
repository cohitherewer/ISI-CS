                                                    Australia up against it

	Perth: Australia were battling to avoid their first defeat since the 2005 Ashes series after India seized control of the third Test on Friday. 
    
	The Indians piled on 294 in their second innings to set Australia a near-impossible target of 413 to win, then picked up two early wickets to leave the home team in deep trouble when play ended on the third day. 
    
	The Australians limped to stumps on 65 for two in their second innings, still 348 away from an increasingly unlikely victory, with captain Ricky Ponting unbeaten on 24 and Mike Hussey on five not out. 
    
	With two days to go and the Waca pitch still holding up well, there is plenty of time for Australian to manufacture a world record 17th consecutive Test win, although history is heavily stacked against them. 
    
	Australias chances were not helped when they lost openers Chris Rogers and Phil Jaques cheaply. Rogers was caught by wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni for 16 off the bowling of Irfan Pathan. 
    
	Irfan also dismissed Jaques, caught by Wasim Jaffer at fourth slip for 15. 
    
	Sachin Tendulkar (13), Rahul Dravid (3) and Sourav Ganguly (no score) had made a combined total of 16 runs but V.V.S. Laxman, top-scored with a patient 79 sharing two vital partnerships, a 75-run stand with Dhoni for the seventh wicket to halt Australias momentum, then a 51-run ninth-wicket stand with Rudra Pratap Singh to push the final target past 400.

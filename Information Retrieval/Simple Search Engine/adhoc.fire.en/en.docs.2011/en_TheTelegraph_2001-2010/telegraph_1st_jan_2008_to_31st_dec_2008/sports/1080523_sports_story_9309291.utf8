The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | There was a sense of fate: Alex
                                                                                                                                                                                                       There was a sense of fate: Alex

	Moscow: Cristiano Ronaldo feared his penalty miss in Wednesdays Champions League final shootout would be the worst moment of his life before keeper Edwin van der Sar earned Manchester United a dramatic win over Chelsea.         
	I dont know what to say, I thought we would lose when I missed, Ronaldo, who had his kick saved by Petr Cech, told a television channel after United won 6-5 on penalties following a thrilling match that ended 1-1 in extra time.         
	I thought it would be the worst day of my life, but the lads believed and we won it even despite my miss. Im very proud of them.         
	The penalties are a lottery. I think we deserved it because we played better in the whole game.         
	Now its the happiest day of my life, added the Portuguese winger, who scored the opening goal in the match, before saying he was going to stay at United.         
	United manager Alex Ferguson revealed it was the first major penalty shootout he had won.         
	Its the first in a big game, said Ferguson, who adds a second Champions League crown to the 10th league title of his United reign he clinched last week.         
	I think there was a sense of fate. We were fantastic in the first half and should have been three up. The second half they were the better team but we recovered in extra time.         
	Chelsea skipper John Terry had the chance to win it for his team but he hit the post with his sides fifth penalty after appearing to slip in the wet conditions.         
	I thought Terry would score his penalty, said United defender Rio Ferdinand. Hes a great penalty taker in training, unfortunately he slipped. I guess somebodys got to lose.         
	Frank Lampard, who equalised for Chelsea, said: In the end a small detail loses you the game. John slips on the penalty, you could see that, that would have put us through.         
	Nobody could deny that after the first 30 minutes we dominated the game, we hit the post, we hit the bar, we were the stronger of the two teams.         
	Theyve won the Champions League but we were the better team.         
	Terrys a mans man, not many centre halves will stand up and say I will take the last penalty because everybody knows thats the one it can all hang on. Nobody can criticise him, certainly not from Chelsea.           (AGENCIES)

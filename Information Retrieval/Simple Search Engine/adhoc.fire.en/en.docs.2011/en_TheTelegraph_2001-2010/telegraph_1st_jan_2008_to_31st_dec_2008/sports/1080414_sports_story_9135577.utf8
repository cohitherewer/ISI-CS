            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kanpur: South African captain Graeme Smith Sunday said Indias 60-run lead was the turning point of the Green Park Test. He told a news conference that the lead turned the match on a track where the margin of error was too small.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The turning point         
	The 60-run lead... It was really crucial and it put us under pressure. Its a track where the margin of error is too small. Once India got that lead, it was difficult to come back, the last wicket pair really frustrated us.         
	On retrospection         
	I think a target of 150 would have been challenging as the wicket was deteriorating quickly. But a target of just 62 gave them the freedom to play their shots as they knew it was not a big score. Also full credit to Sourav Ganguly, it was his fantastic knock which helped India come back into the game.         
	The bowlers         
	We were also not as good with the ball as we have been in the series. We were a little bit too anxious to bowl India out instead of just bowling in the right areas. Today India proved that if you just got the ball in the right areas there is enough up there in the wicket for you.         
	The tour         
	It is difficult to beat India at home. But we have done well here and will take a lot of positives from this tour. We have done well in the subcontinent this summer beating Pakistan and Bangladesh.         
	Finally, Mahendra Singh Dhoni as a Test captain         
	It is too early to rate him as captain after just one Test. He can only be judged after a few Tests.

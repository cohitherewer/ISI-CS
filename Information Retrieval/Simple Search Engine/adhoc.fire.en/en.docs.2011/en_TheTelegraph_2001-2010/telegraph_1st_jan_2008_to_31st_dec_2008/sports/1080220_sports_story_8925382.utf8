	Karachi: Pakistan have agreed to play a revised and shorter home series against world champions Australia which will now tentatively start from March 29 and continue till April 27.         
	The decision to shorten the series to just under a month came after Pakistan and Australian cricket officials met in Kuala Lumpur on the sidelines of an International Cricket Council meeting.         
	PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi said the tour itinerary would be finalised next week. (PTI)

                                                                                                               Oasis Star may cash in on form 
            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT                            
	The Malekpet racecourse in Hyderabad takes the centerstage during the weekend. Its their turn to host the Indian Turf Invitation Cup races. An impressive card has been framed for both days but the focus in Saturdays eight-event frame is going to be on the Sprinters Cup and the Stayers Cup. The countrys best speed merchants and stayers will be seen in action in the two races.                   
	Of the 13 horses, lined up for the speedy customers, the three horses who matter are Cooji Katraks Oasis Star, V. Lokanaths Woman On Top and the A. Hussain-trained Evatina.                   
	Reports from the Nizam-city suggest, all three horses have travelled well from their respective turf centres and they have also been judiciously prepared for the event. However, going by her last win in Mumabi, Oasis Star may be hard to toss. The Senure filly is a strong finisher and the long Malekpet home straight may help her cause in the hands of jockey Y. Srinath.          
	The 3,000m Stayers Cup does not boast of having a star in the 13-horse line-up. However, the likes of Secret Memorys, Orochis Maximise and Arabian Knights are expected to fight a keen contest over the gruelling trip.          
	Among the four, the K.S.V.                   
	Prasad Raju-trained horse, Orochi, appears to have the required credentials to land the trophy. The China Visit colt had placed a good second to Retribution in the Golconda Derby and the four-year-old is expected to tackle Secret Memory who does not seem to be anywhere near his past form.

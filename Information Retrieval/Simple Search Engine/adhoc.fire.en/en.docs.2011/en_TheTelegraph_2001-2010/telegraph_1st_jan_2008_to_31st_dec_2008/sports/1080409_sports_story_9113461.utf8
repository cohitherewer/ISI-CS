The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC mulls revising programme for IPL
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ICC mulls revising programme for IPL

	Melbourne: ICC CEO Haroon Lorgat has hinted that the International cricket calendar may be revised to make room for the cash-rich IPL.         
	Lorgat, who will take over from Malcolm Speed as the ICC CEO in July, said it was hard to ignore the league and the games governing body was more than willing to tinker with the Future Tours Program (FTP) to accommodate it in the international calendar.         
	The IPL is something that is exciting and can be used to enhance and grow the game around the globe. Cricket is unique in that we have three formats now, and that can be used to attract new fans. If we need to revisit the FTP, we will do that, Lorgat said.         
	Lorgat allayed fears that Twenty20 would kill Test and one-day cricket and said all three forms could survive if the number of games was managed properly. If well managed, I think all three forms of the game are sustainable. Its just about finding the right balance, he said.         
	New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori, who is part of the Delhi Daredevils squad in the IPL, also felt that IPL should be a part of the ICC calendar to make it easier for the cricketers.         
	I think everybody would like to see some space for the IPL in the FTP. It would just make it a bit easier for the players. I am sure something can be worked out, he added.x         
	Meanwhile, former Leicestershire captain Jeremy Snape has been roped in as psychologist of the Rajasthan Royals.         
	Former Australian Dimitri Mascarenhas, and now the England allrounder, is also excited to face Aussies in the IPL. Mascarenhas, the only England player so far involved in the IPL, plays his county cricket for Hampshire where Shane Warne was the captain until quitting the side ahead of the start of the upcoming English season. Im very much looking forward to it, said the 30-year-old.         
	He added: Ive played against Australia before But I havent faced Brett Lee, added Mascarenhas, a medium-pacer and hard-hitting batsman, who looked forward to going up against the fast bowler. Ive bowled at Andrew Symonds a little bit in county cricket and Twenty20 and he hits them hard.         
	The IPL will have North America, Mexico, central and south America and the Caribbean in its footprint with Willow TV acquiring the exclusive rights for television, radio, broadband and internet.

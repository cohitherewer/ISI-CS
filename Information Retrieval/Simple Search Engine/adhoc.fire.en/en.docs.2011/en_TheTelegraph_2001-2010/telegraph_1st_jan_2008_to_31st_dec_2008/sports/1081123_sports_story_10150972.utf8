The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Troubled Arsenal lose 0-3 to City
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Troubled Arsenal lose 0-3 to City
                      
	London: Arsenal crashed to a 3-0 defeat at Manchester City, deepening the crisis enveloping the club after captain William Gallas was dropped for revealing infighting and bemoaning the squads lack of fight.         
	While the Gunners fifth defeat of the Premier League season  and the second in a row  derails their fading title ambitions, pacesetters Chelsea and Liverpool were both held to 0-0 draws at home.         
	Arsene Wengers call to his young Arsenal stars to show their strength went unheeded, the team looking uneasy after Gallass explosive outbursts in an interview to a news agency earlier in the week.         
	Stephen Ireland put City ahead on the stroke of halftime, exploiting confusion in an Arsenal defence stripped of Gallas, whose future with the club now seems in jeopardy.         
	Gael Clichy and Mikael Silvestre collided as City striker Benjani Mwaruwari released Ireland to clip the ball over Manuel Almunia, who was made Arsenal captain for the afternoon.         
	Arsenal fell further behind in the 56th minute when Brazil forward Robinho lobbed Almunia after latching onto Shaun Wright-Phillipss through ball to clinch his ninth goal since joining City from Real Madrid.         
	Daniel Sturridge compounded a miserable afternoon for Wenger in the 90th minute by sending Almunia the wrong way with a penalty after the 19-year-old striker had been fouled by Johan Djourou.         
	The defeat leaves Arsenal 10 points behind Chelsea and Liverpool.         
	Joe Cole did find the net for Chelsea after Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given parried a shot from Florent Malouda, but his effort was ruled offside.         
	Hull came from behind twice to draw 2-2 at Portsmouth, Bolton won 3-1 at Middlesbrough, and Stoke edged bottom-placed West Bromwich Albion 1-0.           (AP)

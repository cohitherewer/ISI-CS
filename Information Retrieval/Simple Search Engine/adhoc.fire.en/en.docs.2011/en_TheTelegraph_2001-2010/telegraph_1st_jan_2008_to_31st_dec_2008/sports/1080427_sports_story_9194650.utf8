	Mohali: Despite being slapped by Harbhajan Singh, Kings XI Punjab paceman Sreesanth has no complaint against the off-spinner, whom he regards as his elder brother.         
	It is up to the BCCI or IPL to look into this. I am focusing on the next game. Whatever has happened is part of the game. I regard him as my elder brother and have no complaints against him, Sreesanth said here.         
	On being asked why he cried after the match, he said, I play my game with a lot of passion. I put my life in it.           (PTI)

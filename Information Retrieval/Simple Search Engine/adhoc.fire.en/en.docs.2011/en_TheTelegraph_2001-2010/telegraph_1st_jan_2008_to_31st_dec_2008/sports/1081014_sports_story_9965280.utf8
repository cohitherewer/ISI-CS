                                                                                                                                                                                             Overall performance is good, feels Kumble
    - One bad match doesnt make a bad cricketer, says india captain           OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar after his dismissal on the final day of the first Test in Bangalore on Monday                                 
	Bangalore: Anil Kumble is happy with Indias overall showing in the opening Test of the series. At a news conference, the Indian captain said that one bad match doesnt make a bad cricketer and that he was looking to perform better in the remaining games.               
	The following are excerpts:               
	The shoulder injury         
	Its getting better. There are still three more days to go for the next Test and we are monitoring it closely.         
	If the draw was an apt result         
	I am pretty satisfied with the way we played, especially after losing the toss on a wicket like this.         
	If losing the toss proved to be crucial         
	Not really but on wickets like these, it does.         
	The overall performance         
	If we had won the toss we would have fancied our chances bowling last, but I think overall the performance was good. The batters did reasonably well and these are all positives for the next game. Zaheer and Bhajji did well in that crucial partnership for us.         
	If they thought of chasing the target         
	If Sehwag and Gambhir had got a good start, like they did in the first innings, then we would have given it a shot. But they got out early I think we did well.         
	VVS Laxmans batting         
	Laxman is a true champion. It is sad that he is always under the spotlight. Sadly, there is no one next in line. Laxman has played 97 Tests and has played a large role in our winning moments. All this talk about his performance is not done, not just him, but for any other player.         
	The Fab Fours performance         
	Can you explain who are the Fab Four I am happy with their performance and I hope they all get hundreds in the next game.         
	On his performance and on going wicketless         
	I think all the other bowlers played their part I did play my part as a captain but I want to play my part as a player as well in this series. One bad match doesnt make a bad cricketer.         
	Whether picking a fifth bowler would have helped         
	Look, at the end of any game you can become an expert... I am sure we have the quality to put runs on the board and get 20 wickets. I think we can win Test matches and the series.         
	The pitch         
	The Bangalore pitch is not what it was, say ten years back The soil has changed, a few things were done. It cracks up a bit these days.

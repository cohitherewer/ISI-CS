                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeev, Green share Day I honours
                  Jeev Milkha Singh                     
	Adare: Indias Jeev Milka Singh and Australian Richard Green carded 6-under 66s to share the lead after the first round of the Irish Open on Thursday.         
	Jeev produced a bogey-free round that included a 16th-hole eagle and four other birdies while Green, who is returning to competition after a months break, recorded seven birdies and one bogey.         
	There was some drama for the Chandigarh-born Jeev at his final hole when he had to seek a ruling after finding his third shot in trees and close to TV cables.         
	After advice not to break any branches in playing his shot, Jeev stepped gingerly towards his ball with hands in pockets before punching his fourth shot out to 40 feet past the pin but then holing his par putt.         
	I just wanted to get it out. I didnt care where it went. But it came out perfectly and then the putt went in, said Jeev, chasing a first win in Europe since capturing two events in 2006 including the Volvo Masters in Spain.         
	I putted well today but overall it was mixture of good and bad and it all equalled out really well.         
	Singh also eagled the long 7th after a 3-wood to 8 feet.         
	Green, who birdied three of the last five holes, had not competed since missing the cut in last months US Masters and was delighted with his efforts, particularly after messing up at the final hole in last years Irish Open that cost him a share of third place.         
	The Australian began his round with a birdie at the 10th, and he then added three in succession from the 14th, including a 25-footer at No. 15. He dropped his only shot at the first before his closing run of birdies.         
	Its nice to come back after such a long break and shooting six under in my first round. Ive been home in Melbourne since Augusta with my family, relaxing but Ive also been practising a lot and it paid dividends today.         
	Irelands Padraig Harrington struggled in his defence of the title, managing three birdies but also recording an equal number of bogeys in a level-par 72.         
	Bradley Dredge (68) birdied two of the last three holes and shared third place with Marcel Siem, Johan Edfors and Michael Lorenzo-Vera.         
	Peter Lawrie, who birdied four of the last six holes to win the Spanish Open two weeks ago, did that again Thursday for a 71. (AGENCIES)

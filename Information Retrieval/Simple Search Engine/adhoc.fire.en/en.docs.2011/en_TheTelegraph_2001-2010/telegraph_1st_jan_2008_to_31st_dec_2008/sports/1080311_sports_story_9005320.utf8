                                                     Buchanan: Ishant a good prospect
            A STAFF REPORTER            John Buchanan in the city on Monday                           
	Calcutta: John Buchanan doesnt believe Australia will be removed from the top of international cricket for quite some time to come.         
	Certainly India played well in both the Tests and ODIs during the just-concluded tour. But to suggest that India and Australia are on level terms would be assuming things a bit too early. One series doesnt make or break a team. What Australia have done in the last 10-12 years is more important You have to look at India over a considerable period of time (a minimum of 2-3 years) to pass a judgement said Buchanan, coach of the Calcutta team in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The youngsters are graduating to areas that have been left vacant by the retirement of some renowned players. The depth of Australian cricket is such that apart from spin bowling, all other areas are well covered. Shane Warne has set a benchmark which will be tough to match.         
	There have been quite a few from the Australian academy who are quite promising  Adam Hogg, Shaun Marsh (son of Geoff), Luke Branchi         
	The former Australia coach also endorsed Ricky Pontings captaincy. Ricky enjoys 100 per cent support of all his players. He may have had a bad series but there should be no questions about his leadership.         
	Buchanan, who arrived here on Monday, visited the Eden in the evening.         
	The Indian youngsters have also impressed him. No doubt the youngsters are promising But we have to judge them over a period of time and then assess... The Indian selectors have done a good job in unearthing the best talent and looking towards a new horizon.         
	Ishant Sharmas success hasnt surprised him, and hes obviously looking forward to working with the quick in the IPL. Hes a good prospect. Has good action and pace. But he has to be careful about his work plan and body how it is going to assist him. He needs to manage his resources properly. Somebody like him shouldnt compromise on pace.         
	Buchanan also praised the leadership of both Indian captains on the tour  Anil Kumble in Tests and Mahendra Singh Dhoni in ODIs.         
	It is quite obvious that because of the leadership the Indians could handle the off-field issues very well, not allowing them to be a distraction.         
	Will the bad blood generated between the players spill over into the IPL? I dont think so... The teams are a mix of players from different countries Players with calibre. The potential and strength of the teams will be of utmost importance.         
	All teams have got strengths and some holes. Its going to be a very interesting time as we get a group of players together for a short period and see who moves up that one step  to the semis and then the final.         
	As a result there can be no favourites at the outset. In Twenty20 cricket, everyone has a hand in the end result. The IPL will be reasonably wide open in the first two years. No one team can be singled out as formidable. It is a batsmans game The wicket will also be crucial, he said.         
	On Sourav Ganguly, the Calcutta teams captain, Buchanan said: Sourav is a real competitor. One of the great things to have happened to Indian cricket. Hes a great talent.

	St Johns: West Indies cricket was rocked on Thursday, following the sensational revelation that opener Xavier Marshall and Tonito Willett have tested positive for banned drugs.         
	Both players were among the 32 probables from which the Stanford Superstars squad would be picked to play England in the $20 million match on November 1.         
	Chairman of the Caribbean Regional Anti-Doping Organisation (RADO), Dr Adrian Lorde, told a local newspaper that two players have failed dope test.         
	There were two adverse analytical findings which is equivalent of two positive tests, Lorde told the daily. I cant say who they are. I received the results myself. They had numbers for the samples. Those numbers have been passed onto the Stanford management. They would identify the cricketers. I dont have the names.

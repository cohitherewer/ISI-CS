                                                    Waca track excites Ishant

	Canberra: Young Indian quick Ishant Sharma cant wait to bowl on the Waca track but is confused about the right length. 
    
	India face Australia in the third Test at Perth starting Wednesday and Ishant is excited at the prospect of bowling on the worlds fastest surface. 
    
	I have spoken to my seniors about it and am told it helps fast bowlers a great deal. But I have to learn a lot and am not looking too far ahead, Ishant said. 
    
	The right thing would probably be to bowl full length at the start of the innings and then pull it back, he said. 
    
	The lanky fast bowler felt he hadnt bowled particularly well in the series so far. 
    
	I have bowled well in patches and sometimes I miss my rhythm. Then I ask Dhoni and others and they help me. 
    
	The 19-year-old pacer impressed everyone with his approach in Sydney even though he ended wicketless. He looked back at the experience with a tinge of disappointment. 
    
	I wouldnt dwell on the dismissal which didnt happen (the appeal on Andrew Symonds where the batsman appeared to nick behind). This is part and parcel of the game, sometimes batsmen are given out when they are not out, Ishant said. 
    
	He was the last batsman to fall on the dramatic last day of the SCG Test when Michael Clarke claimed three wickets in an over to take Australia to their 16th straight Test win. 
    
	I was disappointed I couldnt last the final minutes of the Sydney game. We should have drawn that one, he said. 
    
	Chris Rogers, the left-handed opener tipped to replace the injured Matthew Hayden in the Australian XI for the Perth Test, believed it would be a good experience for the Indian bowlers to bowl at Waca, especially Ishant. 
    
	If you are tall, Waca is a good place to bowl. He would enjoy the experience even though Australia have as good a batting line up as any. 
    
	Its also a bit different bowling at Waca. You have to change the length a bit, and it would be important how they bowl into the wind. That is always one of the biggest test for a fast bowler, the western Australian said.

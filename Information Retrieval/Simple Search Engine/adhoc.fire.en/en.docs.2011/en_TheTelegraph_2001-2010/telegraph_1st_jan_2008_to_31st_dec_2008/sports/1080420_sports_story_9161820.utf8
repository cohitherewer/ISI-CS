The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yousuf fumes after Twenty20 snub
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yousuf fumes after Twenty20 snub
                      
	Karachi: Pakistans senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf is fuming after being dumped by national selectors for the Twenty20 International against Bangladesh which is scheduled here on Sunday.         
	Team sources said that Yousuf was very upset while the team was practising at the National Stadium after he learnt that he was again ignored for the match, which is also going to be the first Twenty20 International held in the country.         
	Pakistan were the losing finalists in the ICC World Twenty20 last year in South Africa for which Yousuf was ignored. Subsequently, a frustrated Yousuf opted to sign up for the Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	Although he later rejoined the Pakistan ranks and was encouraged to sign up for the Indian Premier League (IPL), he has been stopped from playing in the IPL because of a litigation pending with an arbitrator filed by the ICL against him for violating his contract with them.         
	Sources said Yousuf, after hearing about not being picked for the Bangladesh game, had complained that if his own people didnt select him how did they expect teams in the IPL to play him.         
	When contracted, the senior batsman simply said obviously he was disappointed at not making the Twenty20 squad and felt he could still contribute at that level. (PTI)

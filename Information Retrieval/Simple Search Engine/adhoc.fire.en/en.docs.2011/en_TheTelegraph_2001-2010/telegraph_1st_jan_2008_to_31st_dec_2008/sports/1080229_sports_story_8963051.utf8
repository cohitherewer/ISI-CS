The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paulse brace   in Santos win
                                                   Paulse brace   in Santos win
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Tasleem Paulse hogged the limelight as Santos FC went past Mahindra United 2-0 in an IFA Shield match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.         
	Currently ranked seventh in the Premier South African League, Santos dominated proceedings right from the start, beginning with Paulse first strike in the seventh minute.         
	That set the tone of the match, which we mostly dominated, Santos coach Duncan Crowie later said.         
	The Mumbai outfir, which finished fifth in the recent I-League, paled in comparison.         
	The players were tired after the I-League and could not give their best. Not to take away any credit from the opponents who are pretty tough and played as a team, conceded a dejected Mahindra United coach Derrick Pereira. Paulse slotted home his second goal in the 50th minute to complete the tally.

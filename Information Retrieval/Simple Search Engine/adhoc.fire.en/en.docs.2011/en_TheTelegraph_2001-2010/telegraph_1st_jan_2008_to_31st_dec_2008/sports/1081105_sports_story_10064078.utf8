The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Celtic need spirit of 2006 vs United
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Celtic need spirit of 2006 vs United

	London/Madrid: Celtic must summon the spirit of 2006 to repeat a famous victory over Manchester United on Wednesday and maintain an interest in the Champions League.         
	Two years ago Shunsuke Nakamuras late free kick secured a 1-0 Parkhead win over United that helped Celtic into the knockout phase for the first time but this year the Scots, with one point from three games, are hanging on by their fingertips.         
	Another win for United would send them into the last 16 with two games to spare if AaB Alborg fail to beat Villarreal in Denmark and a draw would be enough if the Spaniards win.         
	Celtic have lost only one of their last 11 home Champions League games but they have yet to score in three matches this season and United have yet to concede. Arsene Wenger, meanwhile, has accused some opposing players of being cowards and deliberately injuring his Arsenal side as he prepares his battered and bruised team for Wednesdays clash at home to Fenerbahce.         
	Arsenal have a long injury list and are definitely without striker Emmanuel Adebayor and defenders Emmanuel Eboue and William Gallas for the group G clash at the Emirates that can seal their place in the last 16.         
	Winger Theo Walcott is also out after injuring his shoulder in the 1-2 Premier League defeat at Stoke City on Saturday.         
	When I hear people say that my team are not brave, I tell you that they are brave, coach Wenger told a news conference.         
	For me you need more courage to play football when you know that somebody is tackling you from behind without any intention to play the ball, just with one intention to hurt you. I can show you tackles where I can prove what Im saying.         
	Victory over Turkish visitors Fenerbahce will give Arsenal 10 points with two group matches remaining, usually a guarantee of progress to the knockout rounds, and Wenger is anxious to get the job done.         
	A revitalised Juventus will face an unsettled Real Madrid in a match likely to determine which side finishes top of group D.         
	Juventus, who have won three straight games to get back into Serie As title race, lead the Champions League group with seven points from three matches. Madrid trails the Bianconeri by one point, while BATE Borisov has two and Zenit St Petersburg one.

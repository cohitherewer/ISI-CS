	London: Winger Ryan Giggs can break Bobby Charltons record number of appearances for Manchester United in the Champions League final against Chelsea on May 21 after playing against West Ham United on Saturday.         
	Charltons record has been listed as 759 appearances since he played his last match for the club in 1973.         
	However a recent re-examination has shown that Charltons tally included an FA Cup third-round tie against Bolton Wanderers in January 1962 which he actually missed because he was taken ill on the morning of the match.         
	Giggs, 34, came on as a substitute in Uniteds 4-1 victory over West Ham for his 757th appearance.         
	He will beat Charltons record if he plays against Wigan Athletic in Uniteds final Premier League game of the season next Sunday and then also appears in the Champions League final against Chelsea in Moscow on May 21.         
	Asked on a television channel whether Giggs could break the record this season, a smiling Ferguson replied: Theres a chance, I think theres a very good chance.         
	Since making his League debut against Everton in March 1991, Giggs has won nine Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups and the Champions League in 1999.

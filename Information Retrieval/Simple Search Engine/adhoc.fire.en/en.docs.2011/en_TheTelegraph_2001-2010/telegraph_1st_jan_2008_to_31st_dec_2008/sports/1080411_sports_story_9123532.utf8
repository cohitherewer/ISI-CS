  - Do or die for India as South Africa ooze confidence       OUR CORRESPODENT            Graeme Smith during a training session on the eve of the third and final Test against India at the Green Park on Thursday. (AFP)                                 
	Kanpur: India Test captain Anil Kumble has promised to put up a brave fight in the third and final Test beginning at the Green Park Stadium from Friday. Seemingly confident of levelling the series, the veteran leg-spinner on Thursday said in a news conference that the team has a few plans in store for the marauding South Africans.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Team combination         
	We havent decided on the combination yet The final decision will be taken on Friday morning.         
	On his availability         
	Once again, Ill take a call on Friday If I can bowl, I will play Thats the kind of attitude I have. It all depends on how Im feeling in the morning.         
	Ishant and Sreesanths fitness         
	Both are fit and fine.         
	The pitch         
	We would like to take the pitch, weather and the toss out of the equation It looks a fairly dry surface and should assist the spinners as the game progresses.         
	His game plan         
	We need to play good cricket and are confident of doing that in this Test.         
	Playing five bowlers         
	We still havent finalised that Will let you know on Friday morning         
	Whether Kaif will be preferred to Yuvraj         
	At this point of time, Yuvraj is ahead of Kaif in terms of selection.         
	On Mickey Arthurs comments         
	I think bowlers may need to exploit the conditions here I really dont know what Arthur said but as far as we are concerned, we have the capability of taking 20 wickets and putting runs on the board.         
	Pressure on the team         
	We are very positive. We are in the right frame of mind Its not the first time that we have lost a Test and then staged a comeback  We have done that in Australia and before that as well Whenever we are pushed to the wall we have performed exceptionally well We would like to approach this Test in that confident frame of mind.         
	Ahmedabads below par performance         
	Playing in Chennai was very, very difficult And in Ahmedabad, it was one of those Tests where we lost 10 wickets in 20 overs It wont happen every day. The fifth-wicket partnership between Jacques Kallis and De Villiers was crucial Another wicket at that stage and things could have been different It was one of those bad Tests and thats something we have put behind us.         
	On South African batsmen playing spin well         
	They are a good side. We are equally good We have a few plans and hope to execute them We are very confident of doing that. We have a very good record at home and would like to keep that intact

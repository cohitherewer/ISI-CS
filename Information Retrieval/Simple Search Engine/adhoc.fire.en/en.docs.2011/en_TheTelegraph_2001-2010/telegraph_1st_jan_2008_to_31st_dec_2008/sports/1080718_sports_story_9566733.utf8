The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McDowell, Mediate take charge
                                                                                                                                                                                           McDowell, Mediate take charge
                            
	Southport: US Open runner-up Rocco Mediate and Scottish Open champion Graeme McDowell birdied the last two holes to grab a share of the clubhouse lead in the British Open first round on Thursday.         
	The duo took advantage of easing afternoon conditions at a wet, wind-buffeted Royal Birkdale to card one-under-par 69s in the third major of the year.         
	Mediate, who narrowly failed to pull off a stunning playoff victory over Tiger Woods at last months US Open, briefly set the pace on his own after covering the back nine in three under.         
	Northern Irishman McDowell, a double winner on the 2008 European Tour, then joined him atop the leaderboard by holing a 10-footer on the 18th green.         
	The pair ended a gruelling day on the north-west English coast two ahead of former major winners Retief Goosen and Mike Weir, who defied atrocious weather in the morning to shoot matching 71s.         
	Mediate, a four-time winner on the PGA Tour, conceded he and McDowell had benefited from afternoon tee-offs.         
	Agreed the guys in the morning got it worse because it was much easier without the rain but you still had to get it done, the 45-year-old told reporters after needing only 21 putts.         
	Mediate chipped in at the 17th and holed a 20-footer at the last.         
	South Koreas K.J. Choi, bidding to become the first Asian male to win a major, Britains Ian Poulter and American Kevin Stadler opened with 72s.         
	Padraig Harrington, beginning his title defence with a wrist injury, eked out a 74 to lie five strokes off the lead.         
	Although the absence of injured world number one Woods has opened the door for his rivals, Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els and Vijai Singh failed to take advantage in driving rain and gusts of more than 50-kph (30-mph).         
	World number two Mickelson stumbled to a 79 while 2002 champion Els and Singh carded 80s. Els dropped nine shots over the back nine en route to his worst start in 18 British Opens.

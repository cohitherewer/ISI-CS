            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	Karachi: The call for Misbah-ul-Haqs elevation to the Pakistan captaincy is getting louder. Th-e latest to root for the utterly calm middle-order batsman is former captain Waqar Younis.         
	Waqar, one of the all-time great quicks, told The Telegraph: Yes, I guess the time for a change has come... Weve had Shoaib Malik for quite some time... The job could now go to Misbah...         
	Another former captain, Ramiz Raja, had been the first to call for the vice-captain to be promoted.

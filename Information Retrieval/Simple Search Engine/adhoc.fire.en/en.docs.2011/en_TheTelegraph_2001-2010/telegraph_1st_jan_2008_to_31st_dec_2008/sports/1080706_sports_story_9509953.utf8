The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | First pole for Kovalainen
                                                                                                                                                                                                       First pole for Kovalainen
                  Heikki Kovalainen                     
	Silverstone: McLarens Heikki Kovalainen seized the first pole position of his Formula One career at the British Grand Prix on Saturday after lapping more than half a second quicker than his rivals.         
	The 26-year-old Finn roared around the former World War Two airfield in one minute 21.049 seconds, with Australian Mark Webber second fastest in 1:21.554 in gusty and changeable conditions.         
	Despite introducing new aero package, Force India will start Sunday from the back of the grid with Adrian Sutil at 19th, just ahead of teammate Giancarlo Fisichella.         
	Force Indias gamble of putting in a series of laps in the opening 10 minutes and then a final flying lap in the dying minute nearly paid dividends, with Fisichella almost breaking into the top 15 on his very last lap.         
	But a spin in the last sector dashed Fisichellas chance.         
	Ferraris world champion Kimi Raikkonen, Kovalainens compatriot, qualified third but ahead of his title rivals.         
	Britains Lewis Hamilton was unable to match his 2007 Silverstone pole with fourth place for McLaren after running wide into the gravel on his first flying lap and being told not to overdrive by his race engineer.         
	Championship leader Felipe Massa was only ninth for Ferrari, the Brazilians worst showing of the season, with his closest rival Robert Kubica 10th for BMW-Sauber after being sidelined by handling problems.         
	Renaults Fernando Alonso will start sixth while Nelson Piquet built on his first points scoring race in France with his best qualifying to date in seventh place. (REUTERS)

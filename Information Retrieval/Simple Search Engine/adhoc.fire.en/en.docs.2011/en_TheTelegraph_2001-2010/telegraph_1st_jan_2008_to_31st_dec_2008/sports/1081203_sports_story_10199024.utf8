The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussie captain all for a bouncy Perth wicket
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aussie captain all for a bouncy Perth wicket
                      
	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting has voted for a bouncy wicket in the first Test against South Africa at the WACA starting December 17.         
	Still haunted by the drubbing at the hands of India in Perth last summer, Ponting is taking no chances this time.         
	Ponting will be meeting Perth curator Cameron Sutherland before the Test to establish if he plans to use an old strip or one of the recently relaid pitches, according to a report in an Australian daily.         
	The relaid wickets have provided pace and bounce for domestic fast bowlers all season, and if a relaid surface is used for the South Africa match, spinner Jason Krejza may be lose out on a berth in the team for the third consecutive time, the report added.         
	We got duped a bit there last year. We had heard so much about the WACA being at its fast and bouncy best.         
	India played us on a wicket that hadnt been relaid and we went in with four fast bowlers. That brought us undone a bit, Ponting said.         
	The Australian captain also expressed confidence in troubled all-rounder Andrew Symonds and has voted for his inclusion in the squad alongside Shane Watson.

	Montreal: With gremlins creeping into the machine resulting in a double retirement at the Canadian Grand Prix, Force India team management admitted they need to address certain issues before hitting the Magny-Cours track in France for the eighth event of the year in just two weeks time.         
	The Canadian Grand Prix turned out to be a huge disappointment for the outfit with Adrian Sutil retiring on lap 13 with a gearbox issue, while Giancarlo Fisichellas race was halted on lap 51 with a spin and anti-stall problem.         
	Chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne admitted that he had expected to get both the cars to the flag.         
	From our starting positions of 16th and 17th, we had a good race pace. It was a shame that Adrian stopped with a gearbox problem so early on as he was very competitive with the group in front. Weve yet to identify the reasons exactly, said Gascoyne.         
	 Giancarlos pace in the first stint was also very good and we made a call to leave him out during the first safety car period, mainly to get the track position.         
	On his pit stop, we decided to leave the fronts on and only change the rears, but as he pulled away he had an engine stall, which was very strange as we havent seen it before and it compromised his race.         
	We will just have to move onto Magny-Cours now and hope for better there, he added.         
	Sutil was particularly upset after generating good race pace. Another disappointing day. This time the gearbox was a problem, I couldnt shift into the second or third gear and didnt have any speed anymore. I had to stop after 12 laps which was frustrating, Sutil said.         
	It was very dirty at the beginning, but at that stage I think our pace was quite good. I just couldnt find a way to get past the two Toyotas, which was a bit of a problem as they were holding me up, but the pace was there, we just finished too early with this technical problem, he rued.         
	Equally frustrated was Fisichella, who felt it was quite a difficult race.         
	I think our pace was there, particularly in the second stint, but during the first pit stop I had a problem with the stall and dropped right back. We thought there would be a safety car just before my second stop, but it never came. At the end, I had some problems and had to stop anyway. It was quite disappointing, said the Roman.         
	Chairman and managing director Vijay Mallya said the team would delve deep into the mechanical glitches that soured the race for his team.         
	Unfortunately we had two mechanical issues that ended both Adrian and Giancarlos races, but we will analyse why and move on. We have to keep these things in mind but look forward to the next race in France and will not let this disappointment get us down, he said. (PTI)

                                                   Knight Riders bide time on top gun Shoaib 
  - Coach John Buchanan has discussion with key men in franchise       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: In a tactical move, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders have put on hold plans to get a replacement for Shoaib Akhtar, who has just begun serving a five-year ban imposed by the Pakistan Cricket Boards disciplinary committee.         
	Shah Rukhs team is, of course, among the more high profile ones in the Indian Premier League (IPL), which gets under way on April 18.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, coach John Buchanan had a telephonic discussion with key men associated with the franchise, on Friday afternoon, but no decision was taken.         
	For now, its a matter of biding time Shoaib has filed his appeal and theres pressure on his Board to revoke the ban So, lets see how things unfold in the next couple of days Its a wait and watch approach, remarked a well-placed source.         
	Its likely, therefore, that the Knight Riders camp, which begins here on April 12, will start with one player less.         
	Another well-placed source, who also sought to stay anonymous, added: At the same time, one has to look at options One, obviously, is to get a like-replacement The other is to go for somebody who isnt a quick bowler but can add value either as a specialist batsman or as an allrounder         
	Asked if the likes of Andre Nel, Monde Zondeki and Mashrafe Mortaza were being considered in the like-category, the gentleman replied: Absolutely nobody should be discounted I cant, at this stage, say anything more         
	Its possible that the Knight Riders will begin looking at some Englishmen, as (except Dimitri Mascarenhas) theyve kept away from the IPL largely because of County commitments.         
	For the record, according to the IPL governing council chairman (and League commissioner), Lalit Modi, Shah Rukh has requested that the Shoaib-issue be treated as a special case.         
	The IPLs stand, respecting clear-cut rules, is that Shoaib cant play till the appeals tribunal in Pakistan overturns his ban.         
	The temperamental speedsters contract with the IPL, though, remains intact. That, however, is a technical matter.         
	Only those cricketers who signed a contract with the IPL were eligible for the precedent-setting February 20 auction in Mumbai.         
	Shoaib, it may be recalled, was bought by the Knight Riders for $425,000.

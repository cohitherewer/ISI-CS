The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ... INDIANS TO WATCH
                                                                                                                                                                                           ... INDIANS TO WATCH
    - The 10 NATIONAL STARS tipped to make the headlines                           
	DOLA BANERJEE         
	Dola Banerjee deserves the credit for bringing womens archery into the national limelight. Dola, born on June 2, 1980, is the first Indian woman to achieve international success in a sport traditionally considered a male bastion. A product of the Tata Archery Academy at Jamshedpur, Dola has been the numero uno woman archer at the national circuit. Thus it came as no surprise when Dola earned the distinction of becoming the first Indian woman archer to qualify for the Olympics by virtue of her superb effort in the 42nd World Outdoor Target Archery Championship in New York. In 2005, Dola created history by winning the 18th Golden Arrow Grand Prix tournament at Antalya, Turkey where she defeated Ukrainian third seed Tatyana Dorokhova.         
	Dola Banerjee has been awarded the Arjuna Award for the year 2005.               
	MAHESH BHUPATHI         
	He is Indias first Grand Slam champion (1997 French Open mixed doubles). No Indian has won more Grand Slam titles than his 10 (4 mens doubles and 6 mixed). He owns 43 ATP doubles titles, more than anyone in this country. He has been ranked No. 1 in the world, both individually and as a team (with Leander Paes).         
	His three attempts at an Olympics medal has failed. Thats what is driving the 34-year-old Bhupathi in what should be his last Olympics. Thats why he has buried differences with Paes for one last time. Leander Adrian Paes (born June 17, 1973) won the singles bronze in Atlanta in 1996 and the country is looking at him and partner to fetch them a medal this time as well.               
	ANJU BOBBY GEORGE         
	It was the 2003 World Championships, and Anju with a fine jump of 6.70 metres in the penultimate round, clinched the bronze, Indias first athletic medal on the global stage. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games, she clinched the bronze with a leap of 6.49 metres and in the same year, proved she was the best in the continent, topping the Asian Games field in Busan with a 6.53m jump. With the world bronze in her bag, Anju next targetted the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004.         
	But despite a national record breaking leap of 6.83 metres, she had to be content with the sixth place.         
	Anju and her coach-husband Bobby George have hopes to return with a medal from Beijing.               
	ACHANTA S. KAMAL         
	Achanta Sharath Kamal (born July 12 1982) is the sole male representative for India in table tennis to be selected for the Beijing Olympics.         
	He won the mens singles gold in the 16th Commonwealth championship held at Kuala Lumpur in 2004. He also captained the Indian mens team that won the team title at the same championship by defeating favourites and nine-time champions England.         
	He represented India in the 2004 Olympics in Athens and has been the India No. 1 for four years now. He also has represented the country in the 2006 Asian Games at Qatar.         
	In 2007, he was the first Indian to win the Pyongyong Invitational Tournament held at Pyongyong, North Korea.               
	V. KHADE         
	Sixteen-year-old Veerdhawal Khade has created history by qualifying in the 50m, 100m and 200m freestyle events for Beijing Games. He is now the first Indian to qualify for three events in a single Olympics, a feat unattained by the likes of Milkha Singh, PT Usha or Khazan Singh.         
	Though his realistic goal for a medal is London, 2012, he might just surprise us.         
	Khade has to do many big things right until London 2012.         
	Beijing is the start of a long journey for this talented swimmer. And he seems capable of making waves when the call comes.               
	GAGAN NARANG         
	Gagan Narang qualified for the Beijing Olympics in Guangzhou way back in 2006. Since then, he has maintained his focus like a zen master, sticking to the straight and narrow, which though difficult at times, he feels, will hold him in good stead for the August sporting extravaganza.         
	Narang, considered one of Indias best hopes for Beijing, surpassed the air rifle mens world record at an Olympic test event at Hanover in Germany. Narangs score of 704.3 was 1.2 more than the existing world record of 703.1 set by Austrian shooter Thomas Farnik in the World Cup finals held at Grenada in 2006.                     
	SAINA NEHWAL         
	Saina Nehwal won the 2006 Philippines Open, to become the first Indian woman to win a four-star badminton event. She is currently coached by Pullela Gopichand. Her play is dominated by power. A runner-up twice in the nationals, she also holds the under-19 singles title. She has won the Asian Satellite Badminton Tournamet twice. Nobody did it in the past in India in womens section.         
	The only Indian woman shuttler to qualify for 2008 Olympics, Saina is keen to make her mark in Beijing. I dont want to make tall claims that Ill try my best to win a medal. I know it is going to be very difficult there, so I have set realistic targets like upsetting a few big players.               
	LEANDER PAES         
	Leander Adrian Paes (born June 17, 1973) has won various doubles and mixed doubles events at the Grand Slam events. He is also the recipient of Indias highest sporting honour, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 19961997 and the Padmashri award in 2001 for his contribution to Tennis in India. Apart from his seven Grand Slam victories at doubles and mixed doubles events, he is famous for his several memorable Davis Cup performances playing for India and also for winning the single bronze medal for India in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games.               
	RAJYAVARDHAN RATHORE         
	Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore (born January 29, 1970) won Indias first individual silver medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics in the double trap. He won gold in individual and team events in double trap at the 2005 Asian Clay Shooting championships at Bangkok. The gold in the individual event was the third consecutive one for Rathore at the annual events after the ones in 2003 and 2004. He is a Lt Colonel in the Indian Army, he won the Arjuna award in 2003-2004 for shooting and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, the highest sporting honour of India, in 2004-2005.               
	MANAVJIT SINGH SANDHU         
	Manavjit Singh Sandhu says he is learning to handle pressure of the big stage to live up to the expectations.         
	Manavjit, who was awarded Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award last year, said a lot would depend on how contestants handle pressure at the Games.         
	The real challenge is to pick up at the right moment. Thats the challenge which every contender has to face, he said.         
	Manavjit Singh Sandhu won the bronze medal in the Mens Trap at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, Gold at 1998 Commonwealth Games, 4 Silver Medals at Asian Games (1998,2002,2006), 4 Gold Medals Asian Clay Shooting Championships and the gold medal at the 2006 ISSF World Shooting Championships.         
	He was awarded Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award for 2006-2007.

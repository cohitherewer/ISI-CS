            STAR RACER                                  
	Calcutta: It was curtains to the 20-day monsoon season which undoubtably was the most exciting one in about last three decades of this edition of the sport. The new dawn was, perhaps, signalled by the victory of Echoes Of Light in the seasons showpiece, the 2,000m Monsoon Cup. The less-fancied Darius Byramjis runner, ridden by C. Alford, recorded an authoritative victory over a friendless Arturo who made most of the running.           
	Earlier, Alford had guided Averline, another of Darius ward, to a narrow victory in the 2,000m Jeweller Handicap. Alford went on to scrape home in the 1,200m Steinlen Cup atop Pesi Shroffs Synergetic. However, Shroffs Corfu made an impressive debut in the 1,200m No Regrets Cup.

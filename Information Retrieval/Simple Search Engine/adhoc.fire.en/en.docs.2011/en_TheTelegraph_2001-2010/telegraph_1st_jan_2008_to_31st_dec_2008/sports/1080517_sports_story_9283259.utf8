The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knight Riders mauled at the Wankhede
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Knight Riders mauled at the Wankhede
    - Mumbai up to fourth in standings, Souravs men slip to sixth after lowest score           A CORRESPONDENT                                      Shaun Pollock after scalping Salman Butt on Friday. (PTI)		      
	Mumbai: Kolkata Knight Riders paid for the pathetic batting as Mumbai Indians coasted to an eight-wicket victory at the Wankhede on Friday. Shaun Pollock was the wrecker in chief claiming three for 12 in his four overs to rip through the visitors top order.         
	The hosts reached the 68-run target for the loss of only of two wickets in 5.3 overs.         
	The Knight Riders total was the lowest score of the tournament and the fifth-lowest in Twenty20 matches.         
	Sanath Jayasuriya, who made a splendid 114 not out against Chennai Super Kings with 11 sixes and nine fours, continued in the same vein after being dropped off the first ball to remain unbeaten on a 17-ball 48 (6x4, 3x6).         
	Sachin Tendulkar (0) failed for the second match running, but Jayasuriya, who struck two sixes and two fours in one Shoaib Akhtar over, dashed the visitors hopes.         
	Mumbai Indians thus moved into fourth spot with 10 points from nine matches. Delhi DareDevils and Kolkata Knight Riders are also tied on 10 points from 10 matches but Virender Sehwags side has a better run rate.         
	Only Salman Butt (13), Sourav Ganguly (15) and Ajit Agarkar (15) reached double figures in a shocking display.         
	The start was deceptively normal, with Butt moving away to club Pollock down the ground for four, and then hitting Ashish Nehra for the 400th six of the IPL. From there on, only one team did all the celebrating.         
	Knight Riders brought in Mohammed Hafeez for Tatenda Taibu, while Ajit Agarkar replaced Iqbal Abdulla. Mumbai made just one change, with left-arm spinner Rajesh Pawar coming in for pacer Dhawal Kulkarni.         
	Things took a dramatic turn in the over after Knight Riders were put in by Sachin Tendulkar. Pollock removed Butt by having the batsman caught at slip by Sachin, trying to drive.         
	Then Aakash continued his woeful form in the tournament, run out due to a terrible mix-up with Sourav Ganguly to leave the side at a dismal 16 for two after three overs.         
	Pollock then dealt two huge blows by sending back in-form batsman David Hussey and Hafeez.         
	The former South African allrounder kept his line around the off stump against both, extracting bounce and seaming the ball away to induce the edge.         
	A perfect delivery in the corridor of uncertainty from Pollock accounted for Hussey. Tendulkar decided to bowl him for four overs on the trot and he responded by inducing an edge off Hafeez, which was grabbed by Robin Uthappa at a wide second slip.         
	Dwayne Bravo struck a blow when he induced Wriddhiman Saha to edge to Sachin and Knight Riders were left gasping at 29 for five.         
	Then Rohan Raje clean bowled Laxmi Ratan Shukla when he shaped to clip the ball off his toes.         
	Sourav watched the mayhem grimly from the other end and started to assert himself in the company of Ajit Agarkar who slammed Raje for two fours in one over to bring some cheers to the visitors ranks.         
	At the half way mark, Knight Riders were 44 for six with very little batting left to bail them out of the deep hole. The seventh wicket pair added 19 runs, the highest for the innings thus far.         
	Sourav was caught behind trying to guide medium pacer Dominic Thornely towards the third man region and wicketkeeper Takawale took a juggling catch at the second attempt. And once Sourav was gone, the rest folded up meekly.         
	Sachin took four catches, which is highest by a fielder in an innings in the IPL.

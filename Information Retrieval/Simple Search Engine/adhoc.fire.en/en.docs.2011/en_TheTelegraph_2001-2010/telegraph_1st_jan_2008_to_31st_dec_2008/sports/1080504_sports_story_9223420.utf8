	Jaipur: A buoyant Shane Warne and his Rajasthan Royals teammates are optimistic of pulling off their fifth straight win when they host the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led Chennai Super Kings on Sunday.         
	The hosts have the resources and strategy to realise their dreams.         
	While South African Graeme Smith has added to the batting depth, Shane Watson has proved to a fine investment.         
	The bowling department does not look bad either. Apart from Warne, pacers Watson, Munaf Patel, Sohail Tanveer and Sidhartha Trivedi have proved that they have the variations to keep batsmen guessing.

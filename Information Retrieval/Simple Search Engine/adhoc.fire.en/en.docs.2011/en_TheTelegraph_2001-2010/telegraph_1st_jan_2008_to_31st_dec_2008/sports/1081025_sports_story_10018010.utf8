The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gilly in damage control
                                                                                                                                                                                           Gilly in damage control
  - lsquo;Attack rsquo; on Sachin Tendulkar rsquo;s integrity
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Adam Gilchrist has resorted to some damage control after criticising Sachin Tendulkar in print. Of course, its not clear just how effective it is going to be.         
	While Gilchrist has declined comment, the former India captain has confirmed that the Australian called him up on Friday. Gilchrist has reportedly said that his comments were taken out of context and then blown out of proportion. He had written four pages on the incident but the media chose to quote just two sentences.         
	The former Australian wicketkeeper-batsman also said that he would clarify his side of the story in an article to be published soon.         
	In his soon to be released autobiography True Colours Gilchrist has questioned Sachins honesty during the acrimonious Harbhajan Singh-Andrew Symonds incident in Sydney last January.         
	Gilchrist accused the Indian board of playing politics and Cricket Australia and the International Cricket Council of caving in when the spinners original charge was downgraded and his suspension quashed.         
	He also claimed Sachin changed his story in an appeal conducted by the ICC.         
	Tendulkar, whod said at the first hearing that he hadnt been able to hear what Harbhajan said  and he was a fair way away, up the other end (of the pitch), so Im certain he was telling the truth  now supported Harbhajans version that he hadnt called Symo a monkey but instead a Hindi term of abuse that might sound like monkey to Australian ears, Gilchrist said.         
	The Indians got him off the hook when they, of all people, should have been treating the matter of racial vilification with the utmost seriousness.         
	Considering Gilchrists strong stance, it is strange how he could now claim that his comments were taken out of context.         
	One understands that while not all Australian players agree with Gilchrists view that Sachin is a bad loser  Sachin Tendulkar, for instance, can be hard to find for a changing room handshake after we have beaten India, he said  quite a few are in agreement that he changed his stance.         
	A furious Harbhajan said the retired Australian had lost his respect. He should not be talking about Sachin. It is all rubbish. We dont respect him, Harbhajan said.         
	He pretends to be a saint and people say he walks when he nicks, but why does he appeal when batsmen dont nick?         
	If you talk to any guy who plays or follows cricket about Sachin Tendulkar, they will talk about the respect he commands. These guys cant come close to him. I am really shocked, said the off-spinner.         
	Former India coach John Wright was equally stunned by Gilchrists comments and said: During my time with the team, impeccable would be a word that comes to mind. You can talk about sportsmanship on the field but I saw the pressure of being Sachin Tendulkar in India and he had time for everyone.         
	In the heat of battle, I have always thought that what happens on the field stays on the field. That seems to have changed a bit. I know Australia play the game very hard and I hope India have gained a harder competitive edge from that. I think they have, and we are seeing the results in this series.

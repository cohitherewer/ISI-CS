The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bindra all praise for Kapil
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bindra all praise for Kapil
                      
	New Delhi: Kapil Dev may have fallen out of favour with the BCCI after his association with the rebel Indian Cricket League, but as the nation celebrates the silver jubilee of the 1983 World Cup triumph, vice president I.S. Bindra was fulsome in his praise for the former captain.         
	He is a cricket icon, the first Indian captain to win a World Cup. Nobody can take away that feat from him, Bindra said after the board working committee meeting here on Sunday.         
	Kapils boys won the World Cup in 50 overs, then (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni was the second captain to win a World Cup  in the Twenty20. No one can minimise Kapils achievement, said the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) president who will become ICC principal adviser from next month.         
	On the controversy over the removal of Kapils cut out, Bindra blamed the media.         
	There was no controversy as far as we are concerned. The media created the controversy, he said.         
	Miffed after his cut out was brought down, Kapil shot off an email to the PCA, asking them to return his memorabilia if they cannot preserve it.         
	The PCA later assured the World Cup-winning captain that his memorabilia is being preserved in the most befitting manner and his cut out, which was removed due to renovation work, would soon grace the Mohali again.           (PTI)

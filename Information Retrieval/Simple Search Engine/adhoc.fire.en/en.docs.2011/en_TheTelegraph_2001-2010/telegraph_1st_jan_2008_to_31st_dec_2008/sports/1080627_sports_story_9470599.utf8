	Wimbledon: Former champion Maria Sharapova was knocked out of Wimbledon in a stunning upset on Thursday by a 154th-ranked Russian, marking her earliest exit from a Grand Slam tournament since her first full season on tour in 2003.         
	With a game littered by double faults and ugly unforced errors, the third seed slumped to a 6-2, 6-4 loss to 20-year-old Alla Kudryavtseva on Court 1.         
	Sharapova, the 2004 Wimbledon champion at the age of 17, had not lost so early in a Grand Slam since going out in the first round at the Australian and French Open and second round at the U.S. Open in 2003. Sharapova is the second marquee player eliminated in as many days. But her defeat to a little-known player with a career Grand Slam record of 4-5 was a much bigger shock than No. 3-ranked Novak Djokovics loss to former No. 1 Marat Safin on Wednesday.         
	Defending champion Venus Williams overcame narrowly avoided another upset, pulling away to beat Britains Anne Keothavong 7-5, 6-2 and reach the third round.         
	For the second straight match, the four-time champion faced a modest British opponent in the opening contest on Centre Court and was tested to the limit in the first set. The pattern and result were almost identical from her 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 win over Naomi Cavaday on Tuesday.         
	The first set alone lasted one hour nine minutes as Williams struggled to take command against a determined 92nd-ranked player, who came into the tournament with only one win at Wimbledon in seven attempts.         
	In mens play, second seed Rafael Nadal came from behind to beat 19-year-old Latvian star Ernests Gulbis 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 on Court 1.         
	Williams jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead before lapsing into a flurry of errors, with the fourth and fifth games taking more than a half an hour. Keothavong held for 2-2 after going to seven deuces, and then Williams saved eight breakpoints in a game that went to 10 deuces, closing it out with a 124 mph (200 kph) service winner.         
	They went back and forth on serve until Williams broke for the set in the 12th game, hitting a deep backhand return that forced a forehand mistake by Keothavong. Williams broke for 3-1 in the second set with another deep serve return and cruised the rest of the way to close it out in one hour 44 minutes.         
	There was one tense moment in the second set when, with the two players across the net from each other, Keothavong ripped a backhand that hit Williams full force in the neck area.         
	Williams finished with six double faults and 26 unforced errors, 10 more than Keothavong.         
	Nadal, a two-time Wimbledon runner-up who swept to his fourth straight French Open title without dropping a set, lost the first set against the talented Gulbis - a quarterfinalist at the French - when he was broken in the 12th game.         
	But Nadal sailed through the next set, took the third in a tie-breaker and got the decisive break for 5-3 in the fourth. After hitting a forehand winner on matchpoint, Nadal let out a shout, dropped into a crouch and pumped his left arm four times.         
	The womens field lost one former champion, 1999 winner Lindsay Davenport, when she withdrew with a right knee injury before her second-round match against Argentinas Gisela Dulko. The 32-year-old Davenport had limped past Renata Voracova in three sets in her opening match on Tuesday and decided she wasnt fit to play after practising on Thursday.         
	Indias Rohan Bopanna and his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi crashed out of the Wimbledon mens doubles event, losing their second-round encounter in straight sets.         
	Bopanna and Qureshi duo were thrashed 2-6, 4-6, 2-6 by Spaniards Marcel Granollers Pujol and Santiago Ventura in 97 minutes. The Indo-Pakistani pair had earlier upset 10th seed Polish combination of Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski in the opening round.

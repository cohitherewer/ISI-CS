The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No conflict between club, country: Kartik 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     No conflict between club, country: Kartik 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Murali Kartik doesnt like the hype surrounding his playing for Middlesex in the upcoming Champions League T20.         
	The left-arm spinner, who still nurses hopes of playing for India, believes that a professional player must give his best for any team that he represents and not be bothered by talks of country versus club conflict.         
	I never looked at it that way (country vs club)  I would say there is no connection or comparison between the two, Kartik told The Telegraph over phone.         
	When you start playing, you get opportunities to play for different teams. I started my career with a club team (in the Chennai league).         
	Then I graduated to the under-15 and under-19 levels before moving on to Ranji and Duleep Trophies, then Irani Cup and India.         
	I have been playing for Middlesex for a few years now, which means I have been doing something right. It means that I am good enough, especially as a spinner, to be their overseas player.         
	When I was with the Kolkata Knight Riders, people talked about me being born in Chennai, living in Delhi and playing for a Calcutta team, and wondered about the mix of emotions.         
	I am patriotic to whichever team I play for. Obviously, India is the biggest thing for me but I am equally patriotic when I represent Middlesex. At the end of the day, it is my reputation at stake.         
	Kartik clarified that he would have played for Kolkata Knight Riders had the Shah Rukh Khan-own franchise also made it to the Champions League.

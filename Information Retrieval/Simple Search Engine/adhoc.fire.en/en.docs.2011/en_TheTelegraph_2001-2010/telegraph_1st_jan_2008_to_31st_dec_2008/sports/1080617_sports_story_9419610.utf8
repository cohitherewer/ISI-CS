The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | First win for Swiss
                                                                                                                                                                                                     First win for Swiss
            Henry Winter in Basel                      
	Under the eagle eye of Roman Abramovich Sunday night, Luiz Felipe Scolari took over a new team, admittedly Portugal reserves, and promptly lost. Belying their reputation as the most accident-prone hosts since Basil Fawlty, Switzerland managed to score through Hakan Yakin twice, so frustrating Chelseas manager in waiting.         
	For Scolari-watchers, the character of his team were more important than the disappointing result of a dead rubber.         
	For Abramovich and all Chelsea fans tuning in, it was interesting to note that although Scolari rang the changes in personnel, with eight regulars rested, the system remained the same: 4-2-3-1. The key Deco role was taken by Sporting Lisbons Miguel Veloso, although he occasionally switched with Portos Raul Meireles while Fernando Meira anchored.         
	The Scolari traits were all there. The full-backs, particularly the right-sided Miguel, bombed on. Portugal had pace to burn on the flanks, with Nani on the right and the outstanding Ricardo Quaresma bringing his box of tricks to the left.

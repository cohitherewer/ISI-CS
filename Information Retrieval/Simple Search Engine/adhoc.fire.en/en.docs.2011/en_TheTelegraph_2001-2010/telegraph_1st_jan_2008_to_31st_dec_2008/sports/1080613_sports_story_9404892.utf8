The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dola: Medal chances high
                                                                                                                                                                                             Dola: Medal chances high
                  Dola Banerjee                     
	New Delhi: The Indians have done reasonably well at the Asian and world level tournaments and with a pinch of luck, there is no reason why they cannot return with a medal from the Beijing Olympic Games as well, reckons countrys top woman archer Dola Banerjee.         
	Dola admits luck would play a crucial role when she and her teammates turn up at the Beijings Olympic green archery field but the double World Cup gold medallist believes they would go there with reasonable chances of winning a medal.         
	There is no reason why we cannot. There is no dearth of talent and we have done really well in the Asian and world level tournaments. So I feel chances are high, Dola said.         
	 Skill, a little bit of luck and you can win a medal. And technically too, Indians are not inferior anymore, she asserted.         
	I am a little worried about my form, especially because it is the Olympics and I have not done well in the recent World Cup in Turkey.         
	But I am practising hard and I am confident to overcome this phase and get back to my winning streak, a confident Dola said.         
	There is no major international event before the Olympics, so I am concentrating on the selection trials and the training sessions at the Salt Lake stadium. I hope to pick up at the right moment, she said.         
	Aware that a billion hopes would rest on her shoulders, the archer said she would try not to think about peoples expectation, otherwise it would affect her performance.         
	You need at least a one month training session abroad but I dont have enough time and going for a 15-day stint does not help much.         
	 Talking about archery, Dola regretted that not enough women archers are taking up the game.         
	Every year we get around 10-15 new men archers but in comparison to that, few girls come forward.         
	Its important for girls to take up the game or else it will create a void, which would be difficult to fill in, she said. (PTI)

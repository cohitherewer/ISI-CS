	Jamshedpur: The Indian mens recurve team comprising Rahul Bannerjee, Jayant Talukdar and Mangal Singh Champia  all from Jharkhand  created history when they won the third leg of the World Cup in Antalya with an upset victory over Malaysia on Friday.         
	Former world champions South Korea, Italy, the US, France and Australia got relegated to the background by the exploits of the Indian archers.         
	Talukdar and Bannerji are products of the Tata Archery Academy (TAA) and presently employed with Tata Steel while Champia represents Railways.         
	According to Sanjeeva Singh, joint secretary of the Archery Association of India (AAI), Champia finished first, ahead of Park Kyung-Mo and Im Dong Hyun of Korea and teammate Talukdar. With a total of 2035 points, India also shot beyond the previous record of 2031 points shot by Korea in 1996.         
	Two other Koreans Im (680) and Lee (675) took third and fifth places, respectively. Talukdar (678) and Banerjee (673) finished 4th and 8th.         
	The countrys women archers did not perform up to expectations, finishing 13th. Ace archer Dola Bannerji even failed to qualify among the top 64 archers, the AAI joint secretary said.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jeev Milkha Singh in action during the Pro-Am round of the Johnnie Walker Classic in Gurgaon on Wednesday. (AFP)                           
	Gurgaon: Indias new golf hero, S.S.P. Chowrasia, is all fired up to do well against the cream of golfers from India, Asia and Europe in the $ 2.5 million Johnnie Walker Classic starting here on Thursday.         
	Apart from Chowrasia, top Indian golfers like Jeev Milkha Singh, Jyoti Randhawa and Arjun Atwal will be seen alongside stars like world No. 5 Adam Scott, No. 11 Vijai Singh and eight-time European Order of Merit winner Colin Montgomerie at the DLF Golf and Country Club over the next four days.         
	The field also has other top-50 stars like No. 24 Ian Poulter, No. 42 Miguel Angel Jimenez, No. 44 Soren Hansen and No 45 Robert Karlsson, making this one of the strongest ever fields to play in India.         
	Chowrasia, who had a stunning triumph in the Indian Masters, missed the cut in the SAIL Open at Noida last week. At the moment, I am fresh and looking forward to challenge the best of golfers from India, Asia and Europe, he said.         
	I putted badly last week after the high of the previous week (where he won the Indian Masters). I wasnt really mentally there. I went home, got fresh and Im feeling much better and raring to go now.         
	Im looking forward to playing alongside Adam Scott and Jimenez in the opening two rounds, said Chowrasia.         
	The Calcutta golfer is also enthusiastic about playing in Europe .         
	My life hasnt changed  it wont. The only thing that could change is that Im going to play a bit more in Europe. My confidence has gone up. After beating a field like that in the Indian Masters, I feel I can do it in Europe as well. Ive got the confidence to do it again.         
	Im going to give Europe a shot. My plan is to play a maximum of three to four weeks over there and reassess my game and plan ahead again. Ill try to play in countries where the weather is not too harsh and try to find my comfort zone. Ill take it one tournament at a time, said Chowrasia.         
	Vijai, the star attraction of the tournament, said he was quite impressed with Indian players.         
	I played with Jyoti, Jeev, and Arjun. They are pretty good players. Ive seen them briefly on the Asian Tour events that Ive played in. I played in Singapore and I saw a few of those guys there, and Im sure Ill see quite a few this week.         
	In the past Vijai played in India twice, at the same DLF course in Skins Games, but this will be his first tournament here.

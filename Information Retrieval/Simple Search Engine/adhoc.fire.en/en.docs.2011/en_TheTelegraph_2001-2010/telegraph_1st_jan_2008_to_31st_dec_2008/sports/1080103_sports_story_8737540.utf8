	Cape Town: Fast bowlers Dale Steyn and Makhaya Ntini shared six wickets to earn the advantage for South Africa on the first day of the second Test against the West Indies on Wednesday.         
	The West Indies, who won the toss and chose to bat despite cloudy skies, were 240 for eight at the close.         
	Steyn took four for 60 and Ntini claimed two for 63 to undo much of the good work of Marlon Samuels and Shivnarine Chanderpaul who completed a stand of 106 after the West Indies slumped to 77 for three before lunch. Samuels scored 51, and Chanderpaul was 64 not out at stumps.         
	A lively pitch added to the fast bowlers advantage, and Steyn had Daren Ganga caught behind off the outside edge by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher for three in the fifth over. Chris Gayle and Runako Morton shared 59 runs for the second wicket before Morton, who scored 23, lofted a drive off fast bowler Jacques Kallis to be caught by Ntini at mid-off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shiv climbs, Jyoti slips
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shiv climbs, Jyoti slips
                  Shiv Kapur                     
	Munich: Shiv Kapur climbed 10 places to tied 47th after returning a roller-coaster one-under 71 but Jyoti Randhawa tumbled down to tied 52nd following a disastrous 75 in the penultimate round of the BMW International Open.         
	Kapur now has a total of two-under 214, while Randhawa is a stroke adrift at one-under 215.         
	Kapur did not have a very good start as he stumbled to a third-hole bogey but pulled things back with a birdie on the fifth to make the turn even-par.         
	His back nine did not start very well either as he dropped a shot on the 13th but once again recovered well to slot in birdies on the 14th and 16th and end the day under-par.         
	In contrast, Randhawa had his most nightmarish outing of the tournament so far and started with a hattrick of bogeys from the first to third holes.         
	A birdie on the fourth was hardly of any respite as he dropped two more strokes between the seventh and ninth to make the turn four-over.         
	His backward stretch was no less eventful and he slotted three birdies against a couple of bogeys to round off a disappointing day.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Robbie Keane puts Reds on top
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Robbie Keane puts Reds on top
                      
	London: Liverpool beat Bolton Wanderers 3-0 on Friday, Robbie Keane scoring twice to help the Premier League leaders reach the halfway point of the season a point clear of Chelsea.         
	Chelsea briefly went top when they beat bottom club West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in an early kickoff with goals from Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard.         
	There was an unusual incident at Manchester City as the home side raced into a 4-0 halftime lead against Hull City before eventually winning 5-1.         
	Felipe Caicedo and Robinho scored twice apiece in a blistering 21-minute spell to make a mockery of Manchester Citys miserable run of two wins in 13 league matches.         
	Craig Fagan pulled one back for Hull 10 minutes from time before Stephen Ireland added Manchester Citys fifth.         
	West Ham United came from behind to win 4-1 at Portsmouth while Fulham drew 0-0 at Tottenham Hotspur.         
	Everton maintained their good away form with Tim Cahill securing a 1-0 triumph at Middlesbrough while Wigan Athletic beat Newcastle United 2-1 and Sunderland drew 0-0 with Blackburn Rovers.         
	Liverpool have 42 points followed by Chelsea on 41. Manchester United, who have two games in hand on the top two, are third on 35 with Villa fourth on 34.         
	Liverpool played superbly at Anfield, where they had drawn their last three matches, and were well worth the victory over Bolton as Keane scored twice in five minutes early in the second half to take his tally to three in two matches.         
	Albert Riera had opened the scoring in the first half and only desperate defending from Bolton denied Liverpool.         
	Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari started Drogba and Nicolas Anelka up front against West Brom and the recalled Drogba took only three minutes to make an impact as he firmly headed in a Joe Cole cross.         
	Joe Cole was also involved in the second goal just before halftime when Frank Lampard neatly dinked the ball over Carson from close range.           (REUTERS)

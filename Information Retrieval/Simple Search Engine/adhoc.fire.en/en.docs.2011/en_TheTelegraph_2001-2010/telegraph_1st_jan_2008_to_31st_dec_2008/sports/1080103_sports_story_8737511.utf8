The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Odafe: Dont mind playing in Calcutta again
                                                  Odafe: Dont mind playing in Calcutta again
            JAYDEEP BASU            Odafe Oneyeka Okolie                           
	New Delhi: In 2003, when Odafe Oneyeka Okolie arrived in Calcutta as a lanky teenager, he was discarded by the city clubs as an ordinary footballer. Undaunted, the Nigerian moved over to Bangladesh and then switched to Goa. He soon turned out to be the hottest striker in Indian football.         
	In the current ONGC I-League, the Churchill Brothers forward is already the leading scorer with 12 goals in eight matches including two brilliant hat-tricks against East Bengal and Salgaocar at Margaos Nehru Stadium. His strike rate is far better than that of Edmilson Marques and Eduardo da Silva Escobar, who have scored seven goals each.         
	Odafe, however, holds no grudge against the Calcutta teams despite being rejected by the Maidan clubs. Talking to The Telegraph on Wednesday, the prolific goal-getter admitted that he was not averse to returning to Calcutta in case he receives good offer from one of the two clubs.         
	I dont mind playing in Calcutta again provided I get a good offer, said Odafe, who is in the last year of his three-year contract with Churchill Brothers.         
	Some people in Calcutta have already sent me fillers but I am not thinking about it now, Odafe added.         
	For the moment, I am concentrating on winning the I-League for Churchill. We are a good team and perfectly capable of clinching the title despite being placed third at the moment.         
	Odafe reasoned that he failed in 2003 for Mohammedan Sporting because he was hardly allowed to play in his original striking position.         
	They shuffled me around. I was fielded in all kinds of positions like stopper back, winger and even as a midfielder, Odafe said. I could never settle down there. Mohammedan also changed their coach at least five times during that period.         
	Despite his bad experience, Odafe likes the way football is played in Calcutta. They treat their players as stars. Footballers like Bhaichung (Bhutia) or (Jose) Barreto are men of big status in Calcutta, he said.         
	Odafes name, if translated in Ibo language, means God Bless You. It is because of God I have been scoring so many goals, he said.

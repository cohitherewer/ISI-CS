            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Farokh Engineer feels the Indian Premier League (IPL) will help the youngsters.         
	The youngsters will gain a lot of exposure. The real success of the tournament would be determined by the number of youngsters who emerge successful, the former India wicketkeeper-batsman said.         
	In the city as Match Referee for the Calcutta-leg matches of the IPL, Engineer was also all praise for Brendon McCullums innings in Bangalore. Its a great innings. A strokeful lad who batted marvellously, he said.         
	The role of a wicketkeeper has been changing over the years. (Adam) Gilchrist, McCullum and (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni have no doubt played a huge role in its evolution.         
	When I did it three decades ago, no one ever thought about it It was unconventional Twenty20 was a far off then, even one-day cricket hadnt taken its roots, he said.

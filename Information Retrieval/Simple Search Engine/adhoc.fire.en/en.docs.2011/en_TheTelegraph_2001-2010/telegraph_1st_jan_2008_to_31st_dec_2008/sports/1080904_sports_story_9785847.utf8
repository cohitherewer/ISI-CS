                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chance for Grand Double

	New York: Leander Paes continued to sizzle at the US Open as the ace Indian stormed into the finals of the mens doubles and mixed doubles competitions with his respective partners here.         
	Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy breezed into the final of the mens doubles on Wednesday beating the Argentine pair of Maximo Gonzalez and Juan Monaco 6-2, 6-0.         
	Gonzalez and Monaco had beaten the Brazilian-Serbian duo of Bruno Soares and Dusan Vemic 6-2, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3 for a place in the semis.         
	Paes and Dlouhy faced no resistance from their opponents as they broke the Argentine pair in the fifth game of the first set to take a 3-2 lead.         
	The pair never looked back after they wrapped up the first set in quick time.         
	Gonzalez and Monaco had no answer to Dlouhys big service and Paess shrewd serve and volley approach.         
	The Indo-Czech pair won a phenomenal 86 per cent of their first serve points while Gonzalez and Monaco had a bad outing at the Louis Armstrong Stadium getting only 42 per cent of their first serves on target.         
	Earlier, Paes and Dlouhy earned a spot in the semi-finals after defeating error prone Swede-Finn pair of Robert Lindstedt and Jarko Nieminen 6-3, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3 in the quarter-final clash, which lasted over two hours.         
	In the doubles quarters, Paes-Dlouhy cashed in on the mistakes of their opponents as Lindstedt-Nieminen wasted three break points in the first set while Paes-Dlouhy converted the one and only chance to go ahead.         
	In the second set, both the teams converted two of the three chances but Paes and Dlouhy faltered in the tie-breaker, allowing the rivals to stretch the issue to the third set.         
	In the decisive final set, Lindstedt-Nieminen squandered four breakpoints while the Indo-Czech duo managed to convert one of the three chances to clinch the contest.         
	In the mixed doubles semi-finals, fifth seeded Paes and Cara Black of Zimbabwe pipped the Swede-Russian pair of Jonas Bjorkman and Nadia Petrova 6-4, 6-4.         
	In the summit clash of the mixed doubles Paes-Black will face off against Liezel Huber of the US and Briton Jamie Murray, who beat American pair of Jill Craybas and Eric Butorac 6-3, 6-4 in their semi-final encounter.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi has already crashed out of both the mens doubles and mixed doubles events.

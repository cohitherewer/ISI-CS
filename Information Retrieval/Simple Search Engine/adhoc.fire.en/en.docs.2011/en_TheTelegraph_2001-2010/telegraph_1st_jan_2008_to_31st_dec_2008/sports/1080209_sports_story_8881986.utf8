	Sydney: Australia crushed Sri Lanka by 128 runs in a surprisingly lopsided tri-series one-day International at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday.         
	The Australians racked up a respectable total of 253 for six from their 50 overs then bowled the Sri Lankans out for just 125 in the first meeting between the sides since last years World Cup final in Barbados.         
	The convincing victory took Australia to the top of the points table having garnered seven points from two matches. India are behind them with four points from two rain-abandoned games, while Sri Lanka have two points from as many matches.         
	Adam Gilchrist and Michael Clarke both made half-centuries while left-arm seamer Nathan Bracken took career-best figures of 5 for 47 to win the Man of the Match award.         
	Just five Sri Lankan players made double figures and the only player to score more than 20 was Kumar Sangakkara, who battled to a 42. Both teams struggled to score quickly on a pitch and outfield slowed by a week of torrential rain but the Australians fared much better thanks to Gilchrist and Clarke.         
	Gilchrist got the world champions off to a solid start with 61 off 81 balls while Clarke kept the tail wagging with an unbeaten 77 from 86 deliveries.         
	Matthew Hayden, returning to the side after a hamstring injury, chipped in with a valuable 42 in an opening partnership of 65 with Gilchrist, but the only other batsmen to make a significant score was James Hopes, who blazed 34 off 29 balls.         
	Hayden made up his for absence from the last game with a typically aggressive display, belting five boundaries before holing out to Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene at mid-on off the bowling of Ishara Amersinghe.         
	Ricky Ponting, who has been troubled by back pain in the past fortnight, opened his account with a straight drive four but departed for nine when he edged Chaminda Vaas to Jayawardene at slip.         
	Gilchrist, who is retiring from international cricket after the series, struck three fours and a six in a relatively subdued performance before he was trapped leg before by Chamara Kapugedera.         
	Andrew Symonds (12) and Mike Hussey (10) were both dismissed cheaply as Australia slumped to 190 for 5 in the 42nd over before Clarke and Hopes put on 63 for the sixth wicket.         
	Hopes departed in the last over, leaving Clarke stranded on 77 after a watchful innings that featured just two fours but was built on 45 singles.         
	Clarkes innings included a six, which he lofted over long on off Muttiah Muralidharan early in his innings. The Sri Lankan bowling was again found wanting in the slog overs.         
	Sri Lanka made a terrible start to their reply when they lost their two openers Sanath Jayasuriya (7) and Upul Tharanga (10) in successive balls.         
	Sangakkara hit seven fours to give the Sri Lankans some hope of a recovery but when he was trapped leg before by Bracken in the 20th over, the rest of the batting fell away and they were all out in the 32nd over.         
	Australias win was the first of the triangular tournament after the opening two matches were washed out in Brisbane.         
	Their next match is against India in Melbourne on Sunday.                 (AGENCIES)

	Mumbai: Lanky Punjab pacer Vikram Raj Vir Singh captured his second five-wicket haul in an innings in as many matches to help holders North Zone skittle out hosts West Zone for 274 on Day I of the Duleep Trophy final Tuesday.         
	At close, North Zone had further consolidated their position by advancing to 53 without loss after 16 overs, with Aakash Chopra and Shikhar Dhawan unbeaten with 35 and 17, respectively.           (PTI)

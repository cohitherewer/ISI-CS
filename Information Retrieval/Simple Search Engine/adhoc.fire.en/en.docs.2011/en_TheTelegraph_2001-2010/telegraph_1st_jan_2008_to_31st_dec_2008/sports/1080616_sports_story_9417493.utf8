The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poland not losing hope yet
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Poland not losing hope yet
                      
	Bad Tatzmannsdorf (Austria): Poland need to beat Croatia on Monday even if it only amounts to a graceful exit from Euro 2008, said defender Michal Zewlakow.         
	To have any chance of advancing, Poland must win by two goals in Klagenfurt and hope Austria defeat Germany in Vienna by a more slender margin.         
	Croatia are already through as group B winners but Zewlakow does not expect any favours.         
	We know they will be relaxed and probably start with a number of second-string players eager to prove their worth and impress their coach, he said.         
	Coach Leo Beenhakker, who dismissed Polands chances of progressing after Thursdays 1-1 draw with Austria, has changed his mind.         
	We still believe we can reach the knockout stage and we are completely focused on the task, said the Dutchman.         
	While Beenhakker appears set to retain his 4-3-3 formation, counterpart Slaven Bilic made it clear he would rest several players.           (AGENCIES)

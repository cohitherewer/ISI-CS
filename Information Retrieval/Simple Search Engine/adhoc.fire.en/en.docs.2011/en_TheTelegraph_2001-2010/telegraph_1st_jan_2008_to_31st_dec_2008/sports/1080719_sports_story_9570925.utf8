The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diwakar rams a brace to win Cup for India
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Diwakar rams a brace to win Cup for India

	Hyderabad: India staged a dramatic fightback to retain the Asia Cup hockey title with a pulsating 3-2 victory over South Korea, relying on ace drag flicker Diwakar Rams brilliance to score the match-winner early in extra time.         
	The Indians were trailing 0-2 till the 52nd minute of the fast-paced contest before clawing back in a sensational manner with three quick goals to leave the Koreans stunned.         
	After being locked 2-2 at the end of regulation time, the in-form Diwakar Ram converted a penalty corner to tilt the balance in Indias favour in the summit showdown.         
	Scenes of wild celebrations broke out in the galleries as soon as Diwakar Ram netted the golden goal while the Indian players hugged each other to celebrate their second successive Asia Cup triumph.         
	It was again Diwakar who came to the rescue of the team by scoring two goals in the crucial game, which at one time seemed to be running away from the Indians with their nippy rivals scoring the first two goals and exerting tremendous pressure with a flurry of attacks from both the flanks.         
	Apart from Diwakars brace, the hardworking Sunil S.P. scored a goal for the Indians who managed to maintain their unbeaten streak right through the event. Nam hyan woo scored both the goals for the Koreans, who began with a flourish but lost the tempo in the dying stages when it mattered the most.         
	The Koreans drew first blood as early as the sixth minute of the contest with Nam hyan Woo scoring a field goal, capitalising on a defensive lapse. The koreans, who relied on speed and deft stickwork to pierce through the Indian defence time and again, dominated the opening session and could have pumped in a few goals had it not been for a few stunning saves by goalkeeper Sreejesh.         
	Leading 1-0 at the interval, the Koreans attacked with renewed vigour in the second session and consolidated their position, with Woo again finding the target in the 52nd minute. It was just the jolt the Indians needed as they suddenly showed more urgency and managed to launch a few counter attacks.         
	The Indians reduced the margin in the 59th minute with Sunil scoring the goal off a free-hit while Diwakar found the equaliser three minutes later by converting a penalty corner. Pakistan won the third place in the tournament by thrashing Japan 7-2 in the playoff for third-fourth position.         
	Coach A.K. Bansal hailed drag-flicker Diwakar as the new star of Indian hockey.         
	Diwakar had been exceptional throughout the tournament and on Friday showed his potential by first rescuing the team with an equaliser and then scoring the tournament-winning golden goal. India now has two exceptional drag-flickers in him and Sandeep, Bansal told reporters.         
	Bansal conceded that the Koreans were playing better in the first half.         
	The boys were not playing good in the first half and they were not converting chances that came their way which made the Koreans keep up the pressure. But once we scored the first goal it was a real fight back from there, he said.         
	It was a team effort though as in other earlier matches Diwakar came up with an inspiring performance, Bansal added.         
	Diwakar was a satisfied man after helping his side win the tournament.         
	I am really feeling good. Though the pressure was continuously there, we finally did it, he said.         
	India failed to make it to the Olympics but this win was really good. From here I will work harder to do more for my country, added the youngster,         
	Korean coach Lim jung Woo said his game plan to keep the Indians at bay was working till late into the match but somehow his boys lost the plot towards the close.         
	The first goal by the Indians was a turning point and the second goal by Diwakar further helped them in consolidating, he said.         
	I had told my boys to look out for Diwakar. I think our goalkeeper was up to the task to save the early penalty corners but Diwakars second and finally the third goal was unstoppable, conceded the Korean coach.

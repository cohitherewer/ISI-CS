	Adelaide: In sharp contrast to the attitude shown by Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday, on the issue of the ODI squad for the tri-series, Test captain Anil Kumble gave the seniors their due during a Q amp;A session with the media on Wednesday afternoon. Later, he briefly spoke to The Telegraph separately. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
       
	On returning to the Adelaide Oval, which saw a Team India victory on the last tour (2003-04) and where he picked up a fiver in the first innings 
    
	Its indeed a special venue because it all started here... The last four years have been fantastic for me personally and for Indian cricket... I hope we win this Test... Its an opportunity to level the series. Were focused. 
    
	On the composition of the XI 
    
	There are a few possibilities, but wed like to take a final look at the wicket before deciding. Five bowlers is an option and that will be assessed. 
    
	On the final Test being his last in Australia 
    
	Id thought about it even when I played (the final Test) in Sydney on the last tour! Yeah, this time, Im sure it will be my last and itll be nice to go back with a victory. 
    
	On his Australia tours (1999-00, 2003-04 and now) 
    
	(Emotionally) Ive enjoyed all of them, but in terms of results, the last was the best as we drew the Test series... As a senior group, wed come with the purpose of winning... We wont achieve that, but can at least level the series and go back home with heads held high. Indian teams which come in the future will look at the performances from the past and Im sure theyll achieve what we couldnt. 
    
	On the fans frenzy being more this time 
    
	Is it? Well, the fans always seem more passionate in Adelaide... Has been so on previous tours as well. 
    
	On the usual Adelaide wicket 
    
	Its a very good surface... Its good for batting and then slowly assists the spinners. 
    
	On Australia having come a cropper in 2003-04, despite batting first and scoring 556 after Steve Waugh won the toss 
    
	You dont really look at the past... If youd looked at the past records in Perth, then the teams winning the toss invariably fielded... I think it depends on the conditions... Also depends on the teams composition... Whether you bat first or bowl first, you still have to do well in that first innings... I dont worry about what has happened in the past, whats important is to play good cricket. 
    
	On what caused more of a distraction, the post-Sydney developments or the selection of the ODI squad for the tri-series 
    
	Dont see them as distractions... Its been a challenge... Im sure people will be disappointed at not being a part of the ODI squad, but if you look at those who havent made it, then youll see theyve played enough cricket to understand that this match is crucial not just for us, but Indian cricket... If weve got to draw the series, then weve got to put up our best possible effort... Ive explained the situation and they understand... Theyre professional enough to still give off their best... I expect nothing else from any one of them. 
    
	On whether this has been his toughest off-the-field challenge as captain 
    
	That the seniors in question (Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman) have played so much cricket and understand things is what made it easier. 
    
	On his first reaction when he learnt of the ODI squad 
    
	Selection isnt in their (players) hands... Its something Ive gone through, as an individual... Were in the middle of a series and its not ideal, but thats the way it is... Its disappointing for those left out, but this Test is a bigger priority... I know its not easy on the senior players when theyre left out, but its important to focus on this Test... 
    
	On the mood in the team vis-a-vis what it was in Melbourne, on the eve of the Test series 
    
	Weve done really well as the series has progressed and the confidence is great... As individuals and as a team, the performances have only improved. 
    
	On whether one player has stood out 
    
	Very difficult to pick one... Having said that, people have really stepped up, especially in the bowling department... I remember at my first press conference in Australia, questions had been asked over our ability to get 20 wickets in a match... Weve done that and Im really delighted with the young bowling attack. 
    
	On the possibility of both Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma, whove been getting Ricky Ponting out cheaply, being in the XI here 
    
	As long as we keep doing that, it doesnt matter who gets him out... Hes a key batsman and, as long as we keep that going, Ill be happy... Getting him early allows us to get into the Australian middle-order sooner than most expect. 
    
	On Brad Hogg, who is expected to play 
    
	Our batters have faced him in the first two Tests and we understand what hes capable of... Its important to go out and do our best instead of worrying about wholl play and who wont. 
    
	Finally, on the transition phase for teams 
    
	Its difficult to replace anybody for that matter and one can possibly see it among the Australians... Every team undergoes transition and how we do that will be the key... Weve got talent back home, its just a matter of ensuring that they have the confidence and in four-five years well have a good set of players to take Indian cricket forward.

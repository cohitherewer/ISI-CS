    - I must try my best to beat the best player in the world, says nadal           Mark Hodgkinson                                  
	The most famous of all the Lord Cardigans was the one who led the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade. But Lord Cardigan of Wimbledon, Roger Federer, will walk out on to Centre Court for Sundays final against Rafael Nadal wearing his cashmere, cream-and-gold knitwear, and believing that he can avoid coming to a similarly sticky end on an afternoon that promises to define both players careers.         
	Throughout the Wimbledon fortnight, the defending champion has been nothing less than classy. Federer, after Fridays superb tennis against Marat Safin, made the final by winning 18 sets from 18, and extended his unbeaten run on grass to 65 matches. If he wins again on Sunday, then he will lift the golden Challenge Cup for the sixth summer in succession, which would take him past Bjorn Borgs five in a row, and set a record for the professional era. The only man to have won six Wimbledon titles in succession is William Renshaw, who, as was the way in Victorian times, was simply put through to the final each summer. Still, for most of Federers Wimbledon, his progress has looked about as strenuous as taking an afternoons stroll through the Swiss Alps. So they might as well have kept Federer back until the second Sunday.         
	Its been pretty simple, said Federer, who played so well for his 6-3, 7-6, 6-4 victory that Safins frustrations grew and the Russian started attacking the Centre Court furniture. I mean, I havent had any problems whatsoever during the Championships. Its been a perfect way to the final.         
	But here comes Nadal. Many in tennis believe that the Spaniard has the powerful game to end the world No. 1s domination of Centre Court. Nadal lost the 2006 Wimbledon final in four sets, and last year he perhaps could have won the fifth set of their title-match (an angered Federer even raged against the Hawk-Eye computer during the final).         
	The second seed is an altogether better player on the green stuff than he was 12 months ago; he won the pre-Wimbledon tournament at Queens Club, and yesterday he practised with John McEnroe before beating Germanys Rainer Schuettler 6-1, 7-6, 6-4 to also make the final without dropping a set.         
	The only thing that went wrong for Nadal on Friday was that he cut his knee, and the blood stained his shorts. Borg is also relevant to Nadals Centre Court ambitions; the Majorcan could become the first man to do the red-and-green, French Open and Wimbledon double in the same summer since the Swede in 1980. Borg never used to shave during Wimbledon, and Nadal last night looked as though he has also mislaid his razor. I must try my best on Sunday to beat the best player in the world, said Nadal.         
	When Spains football team won last Sundays final of Euro 2008, Nadal restricted himself to jumping around his rented house in Wimbledon, and sending a text-message to his friend, the goalkeeper, Iker Casillas. But if Nadal beats Federer, and becomes the first Spaniard to triumph at the grasscourt Slam since Manuel Santana in 1966, then everyone is going to know about it.         
	But it seems as though there is almost more riding on this for Federer. On the opening day of the tennis season, it was felt that Federer had it in him to possibly do the golden Slam, which is to win four majors and also the Beijing Olympics. But it has not quite worked out like that, and there have been times this year when spectators have probably wondered whether it would be more appropriate to wave the Red Cross, not the Swiss Cross, at his matches. He has failed to add to his collection of 12 Slam titles, the last of which he won in New York at last years US Open. The start of Federers season was complicated by glandular fever, he was beaten in the semi-finals of Januarys Australian Open, and he was thumped in last months French Open final         
	There is plenty of doubt about Federers chances. The Swiss is the quintuple champion, but he is not the clear favourite. You can say whatever you like, as its a free world here, said Federer. But dont write me off yet. This is my part of the season, Federer said. These are fascinating times for mens tennis.

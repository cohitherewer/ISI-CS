 - IFA SHIELD Santos FC a surprise package as century-old tournament kicks off today 
   SUDIPTO CHOWDHURY
              
	Calcutta: On Wednesday, Indian footballs focus will shift from the newly packaged I-League to one of the countrys oldest tournaments. The IFA Shield may not be able to compete with the countrys premier club competition in terms of glitz and glamour, but for a meet which started its journey as far back as 1893, it always holds a special place in Indian football. 
    
	The 113th edition will see South Africas Santos FC and Dhakas Mohammedan Sporting adding a foreign flavour to it, but stakes will also be high for four national teams following their unsuccessful campaign in the I-League. 
    
	While East Bengal are placed with South Africas Santos FC and Mahindra United, the other group consists of Mohun Bagan, Churchill Brothers, Mohammedan Sporting and their Dhaka-based namesake. Mohun Bagan will kick off the meet against Churchill Brothers at Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. 
    
	The following are the profiles of the teams in the fray (alphabetically): 
    
	CHURCHILL BROTHERS 
    
	Having lost the inaugural I-League title to Dempo by a whisker, the Goans will have to recharge their batteries as soon as possible. Their biggest setback will be the absence of striker Okolie Odafe  the I-Leagues highest scorer with 22 goals, who has opted out of the tournament citing fatigue. 
    
	Strengths: No injury problem. Players like Mboyo Iyomi, Chandam Singh, medio Bernard Pires are in good nick. 
    
	Weaknesses: Odafes absence. Difficult to get focus back after the I-League. 
    
	East Bengal 
    
	The 27-time champions are expected to fire on all cylinders under new coach Aloke Mukherjee, trying to prove critics wrong after they barely managed to avoid relegation from the I-League. According to Mukherjee, winning the meet is imperative so that the beleaguered camp can start anew. 
    
	East Bengal will kick off their campaign against Mahindra United on Saturday. 
    
	Strengths: No injury problems. Players are keen to put things in perspective following their pathetic I-League adventure. 
    
	Weaknesses: Players are tired post-I-League and adding more to it, they will be back in action here after facing Dempo in the Super Cup. 
    
	Mahindra United 
    
	As the defending champions (they beat Mohun Bagan 1-0 in the final last year), Mahindra United will hope to set things in order following a dismal fifth-place finish in the I-League. With Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu back in the squad after a long injury layoff and three other foreigners  forward Pomeyie Mensah (Ghana), medio Pierre Douhou (Ivory Coast) and defender Bello Rasaq (Nigeria)  Mahindra will surely be a strong contender for the title. 
    
	Strengths: The prolific striker Yakubus return to the side is a big boost. Strong mid-field with Steven Dias, Manjit Singh, Bhola Prasad, Douhou and a solid defence, manned by Sushant Mathew, N.P. Pradeep, Bello Rasaq. 
    
	Weaknesses: A suspect midfield with both Krishnan Ajayan and Izumi Arata out through injury. There is also doubt over Yakubus fitness. 
    
	Md. Sporting (Dhaka) 
    
	It has been 12 years since the Bangladesh club last made an appearance in the city  in the IFA Shield. They lost 1-3 to East Bengal in the final. Short of match practice since the Bangladesh national League (B-League) ended last August, the side will face their Calcutta namesake in their first match on Thursday. 
    
	Strengths: Blend of experience and youth. 
    
	Weaknesses: Short of match practice for about five months. 
    
	Mohammedan Sporting 
    
	They may no longer belong to the top echelons of Indian football, but they have the ability to spring more than one a surprise in the tournament. They have confirmed their right to play in the Shield thanks to their triumph in the Pradyut Dutta Memorial meet and it remains to be seen how Shabbir Ali amp; Co. will make that success count. 
    
	Strengths: Have won some local tournaments. Both Okoro and Adebayo are in good nick. Will be egged on by a good number of supporters. 
    
	Weaknesses: Being away from top national-level tournaments a hindrance. Some key players are injured. Lack of consistency. 
       
	Mohun Bagan 
    
	The 20-time champions are determined to give their opponents serious challenge. As coach Carlos Roberto Pereira boldly said on Tuesday: Our focus is very much on the title. 
    
	The green-and maroons will look for a perfect start against Churchill Brothers when the two cross swords in the tournament opener. 
    
	Strengths: Mohun Bagan hold the ace over their rivals thanks to the presence of Bhaichung-Barreto combine. Having Douglas da Silva and N. Mohanraj in the backline means the coach can tinker with his attacking options more than usual. 
    
	Weaknesses: Players are tired after the prolonged I-League. P.C. Lalawmpuia and Ishfaque Ahmed have failed to shoulder the responsibility when Bhaichung and Barreto are well marked. 
    
	Santos FC 
    
	This is basically the second-string side of the South African club based in Cape Town, with average age being 23. As their main club competition (Premier Soccer League) is currently underway, only five from the senior side  medio Joswin Hendricks (captain), Tasleem Paulse (forward), Clifton Davids (defender), Danny Bouwners (medio) and custodian Eduan Naude  were available for the trip. 
    
	They could turn out to be the surprise package. 
    
	Strengths: A relatively young but fit side. There will be an added motivation for the juniors in that a better performance here will help them stake their claim to the senior side. 
    
	Weaknesses: Lack of knowledge of Indian football and their opponents.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: National team footballers  N.P. Pradeep and Steven Dias  are unlikely to be cleared to play for East Bengal this season.         
	According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, the two footballers, who have applied for an inter-state transfer from WIFA (Maharashtra) to IFA (Bengal), will not be granted transfer as Mahindra United have put up objections.         
	The ace midfielders, who are trying to break away from their two-year contract with Mahindra United and play for East Bengal, in all likelihood, will have to face the Players Status Committee of the AIFF to settle the issue.         
	 So far, the two have not been cleared, said a source in the AIFF. Mahindra have objected to their transfers.         
	The AIFF source said that the federation would only take up the matter if it receives a request in this regard from the IFA. Otherwise, the matter will go to the Players Status Committee.         
	Meanwhile, national coach Bob Houghtons comment about the state associations will be taken up for discussion in the AIFF executive committee.         
	In a letter to the Goa Football Association (GFA), who has strongly objected to Houghtons remarks, the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said that the matter would be placed before the executive committee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Safin packs off Djokovic

	Wimbledon: Novak Djokovic was upset in straight sets by Marat Safin in the second round at Wimbledon on Wednesday, ending the Serbs chances of testing his theory about Roger Federers vulnerability.         
	The 75th-ranked Safin won 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 on Centre Court. It was a stunning loss for the third-ranked Djokovic, who came to the All England Club confident after beating top-ranked Federer in the semi-final at this years Australian Open en route to his first Grand Slam title.         
	 Defending champion Roger Federer breezed past Swedens Robin Soderling to reach the third round. The Swiss, bidding for a sixth consecutive title at the grasscourt Grand Slam, recovered from a few tricky moments in the third set before completing a routine 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 victory.         
	Top-ranked Ana Ivanovic, another Serb, also struggled, but won. The French Open champion saved two matchpoints  including one that bounced off the net chord for a winner  in the second set before overcoming 29-year-old Frenchwoman Nathalie Dechy 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (7-3), 10-8. Two-time champion Serena Williams had much less trouble advancing 6-4, 6-4 over Urszula Radwanska on Court 2, the so-called graveyard of champions for its history of upsets.         
	Djokovic came up against one of the toughest second-round opponents he could have drawn. Former No. 1 Safin has won two Grand Slam titles. One came when he upset Federer in an Australian Open semi-final en route to the 2005 title. Safin beat Djokovic in the first round of that tournament - their only previous meeting.         
	It was certainly a very bad day for me, the 21-year-old Djokovic said. I didnt do anything that I was supposed to  he was very solid in all segments.         
	Safin said he came in under the radar, with Djokovic under all the pressure. His critique: Djokovic didnt impress me with his game today. I could read his serve. I could return. I could stay with him from the baseline, and thats it.         
	Hes the one who has to win matches. For me, nobody expects anything, added the 28-year-old Russian, admitting he had not dared to look beyond the second round.         
	Djokovic seemed to be vulnerable himself, playing on a surface he is not entirely comfortable on and struggling with his serve in a blustery breeze. After saving three matchpoints, he served a double-fault to give his Russian opponent a fourth, then double-faulted for the 10th time to concede.         
	Ivanovic was erratic against a resilient Dechy, who saved two matchpoints on her own serve in the 12th game of the third set. Ivanovic set up three more matchpoints at 0-40 six games later and, after Dechy saved one, the 20-year-old Serb squealed with delight and kissed the net after hitting a forehand winner to end it in 3 hours 24 minutes.         
	Ivanovic next plays Chinas Zheng Jie, a 6-2, 7-5 winner over Britains Elena Baltacha. In other womens matches, Marion Bartoli, last years losing finalist, beat Tatiana Perebiynis 6-2, 7-5, fourth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova ousted Ukraines Kateryna Bondarenko 6-2, 6-3 and 2007 quarterfinalist Nicole Vaidisova recovered to beat Samantha Stosur 6-2, 0-6, 6-4.         
	Lleyton Hewitt, the only other Wimbledon champion in the mens draw, also survived Court 2 with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-0, 6-2 win over Albert Montanes of Spain that was much quicker than his opening five-setter. Another former No. 1, Juan Carlos Ferrero, had to retire with a leg injury in the third set when he was behind 6-4, 6-4, 2-1 to 20-year-old Mischa Zverev.

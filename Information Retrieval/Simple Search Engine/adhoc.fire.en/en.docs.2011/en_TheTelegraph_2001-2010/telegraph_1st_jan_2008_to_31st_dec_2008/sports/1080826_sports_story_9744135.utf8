	Calcutta: An attacking East Bengal side tore apart Mohammedan Sporting in their Sahara CFL Premier Division tie at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. The red-and-golds won 2-0, but the scoreline could so easily have been more heavily in their favour.         
	Two well directed headers from Nirmal Chhetri and Ashim Biswas sunk Mohammedan Sporting in the first half itself, as Naseem Akhtar twice saw the ball fly past him into the far post. Mohammedan Sportings Sheikh Azim who was doubtful, started for his side as Sovan Chakraborty got another start in the midfield. It was even-stevens in the first few minutes as both sides looked lively and full of running.         
	The first clear chance fell to Man-of-the-Match Ashim Biswas in the 10th minute, but his left-footer (after being set up by Chhangte Malsawmkima) went inches wide. Young Malsawmkima showed his acumen by passing marvellously from his position in the centre of midfield. Rennedy Singh and Syed Rahim Nabi marauded down the flanks while Jayanta Sen and Malsawmkima rendered the Mohammedan Sporting midfield completely ineffective.         
	The opening goal came from the most unlikely of sources, as Chhetri  right back Nirmal Chhetri not striker Sunil  popped up with a header off a Rennedy Singh corner from the right. The red and golds doubled their lead four minutes later as another flighted ball from the right (from Nabi) was met decisively by an East Bengal head. It was the brilliant Ashim Biswas this time who arched back and buried his header beyond Akhtars reach. Shabbir Alis men were rocked and the nervy defence failed to deal with the duo of Sunil Chhetri-Ashim Biswas. Towards the close of the half East Bengal could have extended their lead had an unmarked Nabi not put his header into the side netting.         
	After the break, the black-and-white brigade tried hard to hit back, but Satyajit Bose twice failed to tap in from close range after being set up by Okoro on both occasions. The black-and-whites chances of any comeback were dealt a final blow when Theodore Sunday limped off in the 68th minute after being hacked down by Nirmal Chhetri. At the other end Subrata Paul showed his class, diving about and plucking balls out of the air with ease.

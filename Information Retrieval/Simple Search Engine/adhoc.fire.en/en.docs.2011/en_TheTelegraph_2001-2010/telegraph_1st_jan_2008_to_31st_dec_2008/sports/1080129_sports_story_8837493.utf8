                                                Steve tips Sehwag as next captain
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Steve Waugh has tipped Virender Sehwag as Indias next Test captain.         
	India will be searching sooner rather than later for a replacement for the ageing Anil Kumble and an unlikely candidate has emerged during the last two Tests in Virender Sehwag. His game-saving fourth innings in Adelaide revealed a cricketer who has finally realised that talent alone doesnt guarantee consistent results, the former Australian captain wrote in his column for The Daily Telegraph.         
	He has always been a debonair, swashbuckling type who refused to dilute his instinctive play, but in Adelaide he elevated his game by adjusting to the conditions and showing his teammates that the team result came before his ego.         
	He also picked Brett Lee and Sachin Tendulkar as the bowler and batsman of the series. Waugh said, India have something special in Ishant Sharma if managed correctly This kid reminds me of a young McGrath in his attitude towards learning, trajectory of delivery, temperament

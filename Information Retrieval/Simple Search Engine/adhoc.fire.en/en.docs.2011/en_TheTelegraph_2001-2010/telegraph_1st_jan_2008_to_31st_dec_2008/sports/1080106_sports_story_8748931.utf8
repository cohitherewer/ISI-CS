The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds did it for Lee?
                                                Symonds did it for Lee?
                      
	 Andrew Symonds will argue he was standing up for Brett Lee at the ICC hearing on Sunday.         
	... Insiders in the Aussie camp have said Symonds became incensed after Harbhajan Singh hit Aussie paceman Brett Lee on the backside when he was batting, according to the Herald Sun.         
	Symonds saw the incident and fired an angry broadside at the Indian spinner, who responded in kind. There were rumours that Channel Nine had a stump microphone recording of the exchange. But a Nine source said the soundbite simply did not exist and would not be produced at the hearing.         
	Repeat offender         
	 The Australian players will insist Harbhajan Singh is a repeat offender at Sundays hearing. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australians, when presenting their case will allege Harbhajan delivered a similar racial jibe at Symonds during the seventh one-day International at the Wankhede Stadium last October.         
	Selectors for 3rd Test         
	 In a departure from its own guidelines, the BCCI has decided to send national selectors Venkatapathi Raju and Ranjib Biswal to Australia. They will join the side during the third Test in Perth.

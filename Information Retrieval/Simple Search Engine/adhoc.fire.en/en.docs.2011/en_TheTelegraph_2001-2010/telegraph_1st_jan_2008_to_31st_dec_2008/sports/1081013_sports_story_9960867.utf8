The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer-Harbhajan came hard at us, says Watson
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zaheer-Harbhajan came hard at us, says Watson
    - Aussie allrounder makes an impressive return from Test wilderness           OUR CORRESPONDENT            Shane Watson in action on Day IV of the first Test in Bangalore on Sunday                                 
	Bangalore: Shane Watson has had an impressive return to Test cricket. Following the three wickets in the first innings, he batted well under pressure on Sunday to lead the fight back with Brad Haddin.         
	At a press conference, Watson admitted it was tough batting in such conditions, however he enjoyed the experience.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The declaration and target         
	Not really sure I havent had a chance to talk to Ricky (Ponting). I dont know his plans as of now.         
	If 75 overs would be adequate to bowl the Indians out         
	Yes I think we could, but we have to bowl extremely well.         
	The pitch         
	It is not really that bad and it has held on really well. It hasnt deteriorated as much as we thought it would. But yes there are cracks, and it can get a bit up and down, hopefully I hit a few in the right spots.         
	On the Zaheer-Harbhajan partnership         
	They batted really well but I wouldnt say that they took the game away from us. Just that they came hard at us and we were not quick to react. I thought we bowled well this morning, Mitch (Johnson) and (Brett) Lee had their spells.         
	Bowling to the Fab Four         
	Its a challenge, they are extremely good players and there is no taking away from that so I focussed on the right areas, kept it tight and tried to reduce their scoring opportunities.         
	Being back in the Test fold         
	I havent had as much fun playing cricket like the way I did over the last four days. Its been fun. Have learnt a lot, playing Harbhajan on a turning track, handling reverse swing of Zaheer, bowling on wickets like these which is really hard work. I have learnt a lot, its been an amazing experience and I have enjoyed the Test match atmosphere.         
	On his partnership with Haddin         
	It was hard work, it was about survival. Zaheer bowled well all through and he was reversing as well. Harbhajan was good and it was difficult to get them away for runs. Survival was tough and we were focused on that. Not that we were defending every ball, but like we saw yesterday (Saturday), when Zaheer and Harbhajan went after us, being aggressive and playing a few shots can get you out of the hole. Of course with a bit of luck, Haddin and I did try a few shots.

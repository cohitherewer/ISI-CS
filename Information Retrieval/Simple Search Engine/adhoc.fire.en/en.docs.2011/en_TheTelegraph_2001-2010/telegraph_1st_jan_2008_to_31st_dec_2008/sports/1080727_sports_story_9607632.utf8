	During a 15-year period, the charismatic American athlete showed immense talent coupled with an impeccable sporting personality to make him one of the biggest stars of the past century.  
	His results speak for themselves: nine Olympic gold medals in four disciplines (long jump, 100m, 200m and the 4x100m relay) and eight world championship titles.         
	In the history books, King Carl will remain inextricably linked with his illustrious compatriot Jesse Owens (four titles at Berlin in 1936), winning four gold medals in the same events (100m, 200m, long jump and the 4x100m relay) in the Los Angeles Games in 1984.         
	Lewiss ninth medal placed the sprint specialist alongside middle distance all time great Paavo Nurmi. Known as the the Flying Finn, he had previously been the only athlete to have won nine Olympic gold medals.

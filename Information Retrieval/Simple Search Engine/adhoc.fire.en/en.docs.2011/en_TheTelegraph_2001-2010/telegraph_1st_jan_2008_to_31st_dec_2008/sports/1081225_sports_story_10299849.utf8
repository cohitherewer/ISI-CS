The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lankas tour of Pak in doubt
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lankas tour of Pak in doubt
                      
	Colombo: Backing New Delhis stance, Sri Lanka are unlikely to tour Pakistan with authorities reconsidering the decision of sacked Sri Lanka Cricket chairman Arjuna Ranatunga, who favoured playing there after India pulled out.         
	We follow a pro-India policy. We know the circumstances in which the Indian tour to Pakistan was called off. The tour (of Sri Lanka to Pakistan) is unlikely, top sources said on Wednesday.         
	When contacted, Sri Lankan sports and recreation minister Gamini Lokuge said he would hold discussions with the Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa on the issue.         
	We are reconsidering the decisions taken by Arjuna Ranatunga, Lokuge said adding that the foreign ministry would also be consulted on the proposed tour.         
	Ranatunga, who was sacked as the SLC chairman on Tuesday, had last week confirmed the cricket teams visit to Pakistan after the Bangladesh cricket series.         
	We have a duty as a friendly neighbour in the region to help Pakistan when it is needed most, Ranatunga had said.         
	An SLC official said they agreed to take Indias place and asked the hosts to scrap two Twenty20 games and turn them into one-day matches.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Board had sent an invitation to the Sri Lankans after the Indian government pulled the plug on its cricket teams tour of Pakistan, scheduled to start from January 4.

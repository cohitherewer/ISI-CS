	Nagpur: The Australian team came under the scanner on Sunday after television replays showed Cameron White peeling the leather off the ball on the penultimate day of the fourth and final Test against India.         
	Umpire Billy Bowden had an extended chat on the field with Australia captain Ricky Ponting regarding the incident, during the second session of the fourth days play.         
	Television replays showed White peeling a piece of leather off the ball. The ball had crashed into the boundary hoardings and suffered some damage. The umpires, however, resumed play deciding to keep the ball unchanged.         
	Neither the umpires  New Zealander Bowden, who is officiating in his 50th Test, and Pakistans Aleem Dar  nor match referee Chris Broad could be reached for a comment.         
	The ICC Code of Conduct, in its clause 2.9 under the head For Players and Officials, lists the following actions as not permitted and as those that could lead to charges of altering the condition of the ball:         
	1. Deliberately throwing the ball into the ground for the purpose of roughening it up.         
	2. Applying any artificial substance to the ball; and applying any non-artificial substance for any purpose other than to polish the ball.         
	3. Lifting or otherwise interfering with any of the seams of the ball.         
	4. Scratching the surface of the ball with finger or thumb nails or any implement.         
	The clause adds: The umpires shall use their judgement to apply the principle that actions taken to maintain or enhance the condition of the ball, provided no artificial substances are used, shall be permitted. Any actions taken with the purpose of damaging the condition of the ball or accelerating the deterioration of the condition of the ball shall not be permitted.

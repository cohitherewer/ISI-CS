The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajan has, in the past, been protected: Steve
                                                                                                                                                                                             Harbhajan has, in the past, been protected: Steve
  - The Indian cricketer of today is of a different prototype, says icon         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Steve Waugh in the city on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The talismanic Steve Waugh, a most sought after ambassador for promoting the biggest brands in Australia, arrived in the city on Wednesday for a brief (very personal) visit.         
	In the evening, after attending a function at the Floatel, Steve spoke to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Having visited Udayan (in Shamlu Dudejas company, as usual) after quite some time         
	Well, yes I love going back to Udayan The kids there are fantastic and, then, its so peaceful and tranquil Its an enjoyable place and I like seeing the smiling faces of the kids Udayan, I think, is great for the human spirit It does uplift you.         
	What took him to New Delhi, from where he hopped over to Calcutta         
	Im in India with a group called Navitas Its a premier Australian education pathway provider and theyre looking to recruit a lot more students from India Education is the way for people to go forward and Im happy to be playing a part in this process.         
	Whether he has been following the Indian Premier League (IPL)         
	Ive been watching some of it on the TV and have been reading about it Twenty20 is an exciting form of cricket, but theyve got to make sure that they dont get too out of control with it Test cricket has to remain the basis for our cricket and that cant be eroded Twenty20 encourages new markets Perhaps China and the US Indeed, its good for the spectators and sponsors. Id say its good for cricket.         
	Disappointed that some actually started the country versus IPL debate         
	Ill be very disappointed if players put their country second At the same time, the Boards have to recognise that very good money is on offer and a place has to be found for the IPL in the calendar I played for my country, because I wanted to, and made money by playing well.         
	On Harbhajan Singh slapping Sreesanth last week         
	Look, you should never lay your hand on anyone on a sports field Then, to whack someone you play with (for the country) is quite outrageous Harbhajan has, in the past, been protected by people around him Theres been concern over him for a while From what I gather, hes fortunate to be banned for only 11 (or 13) games in the IPL.         
	The India-Australia rivalry, which has gone to a new level in this century, vis--vis the Ashes         
	Theres definitely a shift towards the sub-continent The power base is shifting India have definitely emerged as the one to pose the greatest challenge to Australias supremacy The IPL will only make it better for India because more players are being exposed to pressure situations in front of big crowds. Moreover, you already have some promising fast bowlers around The guys whove been there for a long time wont necessarily have a guaranteed spot (in Team India)         
	His take on the Indian team being much more competitive nowadays         
	Could be because theyre getting together more as a unit They definitely seem more together, more focused The Indian cricketer of today is of a different prototype Very positive, quite aggressive Theyre no longer timid cricketers, theyre very confronting They back themselves.         
	Whether, if hed been the Australian captain, there wouldve been less bad blood during Team Indias recent tour of Australia         
	Hard to say, for I dont know exactly what happened Somebody like Harbhajan You can only tell him something that many times, though After that, the Harbhajans have to take responsibility for their acts themselves Im sure both India and Australia wouldve liked to have resolved things differently Once it went out of the playing area, in the public domain and in the media, then everybody had an opinion on everything.         
	Thoughts on successor Ricky Ponting         
	Hes done a fantastic job Hes kept the traditions going and (in comparison) has tasted more success in the one-dayers         
	The image of the International Cricket Council (ICC) taking a beating with the latest controversy over outgoing chief executive Malcolm Speed         
	It doesnt have a great reputation for sure Youd like to have such bodies being strong in views, but one has seen a split (in the ICC) quite a few times Speeds quite a strong character and, obviously, he wasnt happy with an issue (Zimbabwe) At least he stood for something The ICC, I feel, must stand for something otherwise it will fall for everything.         
	Finally, his message for youngsters         
	(Smiles) Those whore looking to play for the country must first play before looking for the rewards If you look for the rewards first, then your priorities just arent right. Work hard and follow the process instead of straightaway looking at the end goal Ultimately, youll be judged on how you come out of adversity.

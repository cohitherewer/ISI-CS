            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: All matches in the AFC Challenge Cup, barring three, will be played at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in Hyderabad instead of the Gachibowli Stadium, according to All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary Alberto Colaco.         
	Earlier, the meet was scheduled to be played at Gachibowli, the state of the art stadium built on the outskirts of Hyderabad when the city hosted the Afro Asian Games.         
	The local organisers felt it would be difficult to attract spectators if it is played at Gachibowli, Colaco said. Moreover, we need two different venues to hold simultaneous matches on the last two days of the group league.         
	Under the new arrangement, only three matches, including the final will be played at Gachibowli. India will play their three group league matches against Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, situated at the centre of the city.         
	The news should please coach Bob Houghton as he wanted a venue where more people would come to support the home team.

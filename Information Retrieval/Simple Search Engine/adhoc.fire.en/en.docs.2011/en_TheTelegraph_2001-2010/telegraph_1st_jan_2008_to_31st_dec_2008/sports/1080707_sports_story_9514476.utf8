            A STAFF REPORTER            Mahela Jayawardene receives the Asia Cup from President Pervez Musharraf on Sunday                           
	Calcutta: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said life must go on and sporting events like the Asia Cup would continue to be held in the country, despite Sundays bomb blast in Islamabad.         
	Condemning the blast, Musharraf said he was very happy to be present at the final, but was saddened by the bomb blast.         
	The fight against terrorism must go on and life must continue. We have to fight terrorism together, he said.         
	Such healthy competitions are important and necessary for Pakistan and in this region. I congratulate the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Asian Cricket Council for organising this event successfully.         
	Musharraf also congratulated the Sri Lankan team for their victory and consistent performance in the Asia Cup.         
	I would like to congratulate the Sri Lanka team for winning the Asia Cup and also the consistent form that they showed throughout the tournament, the President said.         
	He spent considerable time meeting and shaking hands with the players before the prize distribution ceremony and thanked the crowd for their support.         
	I must say the Pakistan team also showed a lot of hospitality in allowing two visiting teams to play the final!         
	On a lighter note, he said: I think the Pakistan team showed a bit too much hospitality to the visiting teams.

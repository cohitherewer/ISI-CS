	London: England scythed through New Zealands frail top order at Lords on Thursday to take command of the first Test before the end of the opening session.         
	In an extended afternoon spell after rain washed out play before lunch, New Zealand lurched to 109 for five at tea after England captain Michael Vaughan won the toss and seized the opportunity to bowl.         
	Vaughans decision was vindicated in James Andersons first over after Ryan Sidebottom had opened from the Nursery End.         
	Aaron Redmond, playing his first Test, steered the fifth delivery at a comfortable height to Alastair Cook at third slip and was out for a duck. His debut contrasted starkly with that of his father Rodney, one of Test crickets statistical oddities who scored 107 and 56 in his only Test.         
	James Marshall relieved the pressure with a firm bottom-handed drive for four through the covers but was fortunate when he edged a simple catch off Anderson to Tim Ambrose behind the stumps only for umpire Simon Taufel to call a no-ball. Marshall was on nine at the time with the score 17.         
	One run later Jamie How (7) became Andersons second victim, nicking a delivery which moved away slightly to give Ambrose a straightforward catch.         
	Ross Taylor turned his first ball to mid-wicket for four then did his best to gift England a third wicket when he set off for an impossible single. Marshall had given up all hope of making the strikers end but received a second let-off when Anderson missed a shy at the stumps.         
	Taylor continued to play as if he were in a Twenty20 match, slashing three fours before skying a hook off Stuart Broad which ended up in the hands of Paul Collingwood running back at second slip. His 19 runs had taken only 20 balls but was hardly the innings his team required in the circumstances.         
	Brendon McCullum, promoted to number five, struggled against the England pace bowlers off-stump line and took an uncharacteristic 18 balls before pushing Sidebottom through the leg side for his first boundary.         
	He lost Marshall, who had shown the application and technique lacking in his team mates, for 24 in 104 minutes, edging Broad to Andrew Strauss at first slip with the total on 76.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Playing 2 spinners best bet: Kevin
                                                                                                                                                                                           Playing 2 spinners best bet: Kevin
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Kevin Pietersen admitted on Wednesday that England were the underdogs going into the two-Test series, but said they would give it their best shot.         
	The England captain also said that watching Australia off-spinner Jason Krejza, who claimed 12 wickets on his Test debut in Nagpur last month, convinced him that playing two spinners was the best way to win in India.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The decision to pick Swann         
	Its a decision we have taken because we think the wicket could turn. Weve had a look at it and it probably gives us our best and most attacking option.         
	Graeme has bowled absolutely fantastically leading up to this Test match and has done a great job.         
	The logic behind picking two spinners         
	They (Indians) are not bad players of spin but its pretty important we go in with two spinners. It doesnt matter how good a player of spin you are, you still have to play well on the day.         
	Any debutant is keen and hell be ready and right at the Indian batsmen. We saw Krejza do well against India as an off-spinner, and I think Swann can do a better job.

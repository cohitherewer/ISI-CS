The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting praise for Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ponting praise for Sourav
                  Ricky Ponting                     
	Melbourne: Ricky Ponting became an admirer of Sourav Ganguly after watching him from close quarters during the Indian Premier League.         
	Sourav is very driven in the way he trains and prepares, a bloke who will get into a net and bat and bat and bat, Ponting said about his Kolkata Knight Riders captain in his Captains Diary 2008, which would be released by Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland on Thursday.         
	There were couple of times when I was due to use his net straight after him but I was left standing there, waiting 20 or 30 minutes with my pads on, before I finally had my hit.         
	Ponting said he enjoyed sharing the dressing room with players of different countries.         
	I want the IPL to work and I really want my team Kolkata Knight Riders to win. I was in India for a fortnight before the first IPL game, working on my game everyday, and for two weeks. By the time the first Twenty20 ball was bowled, I was really excited about the game.         
	Sharing a dressing with blokes from different countries is something I havent done a lot of during my career. I love the team environment and being able to help people.         
	Ponting said he could not imagine giving up international cricket to play IPL but doubted that would be the case with everyone. If the IPL keeps growing ... the next generation might opt for franchise over country. Everyone in the game should work towards ensuring that never happens, he wrote.

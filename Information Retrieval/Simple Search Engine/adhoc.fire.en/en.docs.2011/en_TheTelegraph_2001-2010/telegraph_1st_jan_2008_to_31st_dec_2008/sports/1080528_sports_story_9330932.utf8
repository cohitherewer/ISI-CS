The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL showing should count, says Sehwag
                                                                                                                                                                                                     IPL showing should count, says Sehwag
                      
	New Delhi: Indian Premier Leagues Twenty20 format may not attract purists but selectors should consider IPL performance before picking the Indian squad for the tri-series in Bangladesh and the Asia cup in Pakistan, according to Virender Sehwag.         
	The Delhi DareDevils captain said IPL has transcended boundaries to reach people in the furthest corner and so it would be wrong to completely ignore the players performance in the Twenty20 league.         
	IPL performance should matter. Everyone is watching IPL. Im getting text messages from England, Pakistan, and the West Indies, all saying we are doing well. I think selectors should take IPL performance into account when they select the Indian squad, Sehwag said on Tuesday.         
	According to him, a number of youngsters have made their mark and they should be blooded.         
	So many youngsters have done well in the tournament. For us, Shikhar Dhawan has done well, so did Yo Mahesh and Pradeep Sangwan.         
	India play a tri-series in Bangladesh, they play Asia cup in Pakistan and then there is Champions Trophy. A lot of cricket is to be played this year and I think selectors should, on rotation, give chances to the youngsters to play alongside the seniors, he said.         
	Sehwag admitted the DareDevils owed it to lady luck as they sneaked their way into the IPL semi-finals after Shane Warnes Rajasthan Royals pipped Sachin Tendulkars Mumbai Indians in a thriller at Jaipur on Monday.         
	Initially, we were unfortunate to lose a few close matches but finally luck seems to have smiled on us and here we are in the semi-finals. I think luck is a crucial factor and we are happy to be lucky, Sehwag said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maria serves way to title
                                                Maria serves way to title
            LISA DILLMAN                      
	Melbourne: Shades of last year popped to the surface, but only for the briefest of moments, and the damage was contained to one service game.         
	That was essentially the only time Maria Sharapovas nerve and serve truly faltered  three double faults in one game in the first set, including two in a row  in the Australian Open final on Saturday against Ana Ivanovic of Serbia.         
	But the serve, which so bedevilled her in the final against Serena Williams last year, pulled her out of trouble later in the first set when she was on the back foot, two points from losing it.         
	That escape seemed to embolden her and the fifth-seeded Sharapova lost only two points on her serve in the second set, as she beat No. 4 Ivanovic 7-5, 6-3 in one hour and 31 minutes.         
	Sharapova dropped to her knees after Ivanovics final forehand sailed wide and was moved to tears. It was her third Grand Slam tournament championship, and the 20-year-old Russian, incredibly, is one major from a career Slam.         
	She added the Australian title to a resume that included triumphs at Wimbledon (2004) and the US Open (2006), and now is missing only the French Open.         
	But thats in the future.         
	Sharapova was focused from the first week in Melbourne, treating her second-round match against Lindsay Davenport like a semi-final or a final.         
	Whatever it took, I was going to be there no matter what, said Sharapova, who did not lose a set in seven matches, including a quarter final in which she dramatically ended Justine Henins 32-match winning streak.         
	There were plenty of reasons for the emotion. Ivanovic, 20, who was playing in her first Australian Open final and her second major final, got choked up, too, during her on-court speech when she thanked her supporters.         
	Inspiration was hardly lacking for Sharapova, who struggled with shoulder problems most of 2007.         
	In a heartfelt speech during the award ceremony, she dedicated the title to Jane Joyce, the late mother of her long-time hitting partner, Michael Joyce.         
	Sharapova later spoke of how they often thought about his mother, who passed away last year after a long battle with cancer, and how tennis became so small and put everything else in perspective.         
	Sharapova, meanwhile, could be the last Australian Open womens champion crowned in daylight hours. Melbournes The Age reported on Sunday that the womens final is likely to be shifted from its Saturday afternoon slot to Saturday night in a move driven by the demands of television broadcasters.

	Bangalore: India discard Mohammed Kaif struck a useful unbeaten half century (68) to help India A recover from a disastrous start as the hosts reached 180 for four on the first day of the three-day match against Australia a here Wednesday.         
	Kaif and Virat Kohli shared an unbroken fifth wicket stand of 90 runs after spinner Bryce McGain ripped through the home team top order with a three-wicket burst at the M. Chinnaswamy stadium.         
	The 36-year-old leg spinner dismissed Robin Uthappa (22), Parthiv Patel (13) and skipper S. Badrinath (10) as the visitors gained an early advantage before Kaif and Kohli did the rescue act after the home team opted to bat first.         
	Coming together when the team was struggling at 90 for four, the Indian duo dug in and steadied the boat, putting on a 90-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership in 31.1 overs.         
	At stumps on the opening day, India A were 180 for the loss of four wickets in 60 overs after play started at 1.15 PM following wet ground conditions due to rain.

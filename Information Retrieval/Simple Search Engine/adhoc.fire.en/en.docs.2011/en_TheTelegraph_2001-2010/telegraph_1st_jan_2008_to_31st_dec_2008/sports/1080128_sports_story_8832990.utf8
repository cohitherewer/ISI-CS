The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajans appeal 
                                                Harbhajans appeal 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Adelaide: The details arent clear, but it appears the Board of Control for Cricket in India and Cricket Australia have reached some understanding ahead of the hearing of Harbhajan Singhs appeal against a three-Test ban.         
	It seems some understanding is there and its quite likely that the racist abuse charge will be scaled down when the appeal is heard by the appeals commissioner, Justice John Hansen, one of The Telegraphs sources said on Sunday evening.         
	The appeal will be heard here on Tuesday and Wednesday.         
	Harbhajan, it may be recalled, got banned by Match Referee Mike Procter for calling Andrew Symonds a monkey  a charge he denied  during the SCG Test.         
	The Indians want the racist abuse bit taken off, otherwise (as first reported in these columns earlier this month) the team could pull out of the tri-series which begins on February 3.

   A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL
                  
	Perth: An emotional former India captain and cricket manager Ravi Shastri was among those who witnessed the fantastic 72-run victory at the Waca on Saturday. Later, he spoke to The Telegraph. 
       
	The following are excerpts: 
       
	On Team Indias stunning win within four days 
    
	Its one of our greatest because it has come in an Australian stronghold... It has come at a time when, after what happened in Sydney, the chips were down... That Anil Kumble could rally his men around and get them to play in this fashion is an outstanding achievement. 
    
	On whether hed got worried when the ninth-wicket pair (Mitchell Johnson, Stuart Clark) began scoring at will 
    
	No, not really, for we had many runs in the bank... But, yes, I did ask myself why had the team begun to do things differently... They shouldve continued with normal cricket... Set regular fields, bowl a good length and forget that they were bowling to tailenders... Things wouldve happened and they did. 
    
	On the significance of what happened at the Waca 
    
	It has set the tone for the rest of the tour and sent a strong message to the Australian public  that this team is here to compete hard and with a bit of luck (in Sydney), couldve been 2-1 up. 
    
	On whether hed expected such a strong comeback 
    
	To be frank, no... Its not easy to make such a comeback... It requires tough characters and a tough captain... After what happened in Sydney, the captain needed to keep his players hungry for success and Kumble succeeded. If Ive got to single out one individual for the highest praise, then my man is Kumble. 
    
	On having indirectly influenced Kumbles appointment as the Test captain, two months ago 
    
	Well... Kumble has handled himself the way Id expected him to... Hes turned out to be a master statesman and has conducted himself with great dignity... Not many people wouldve handled the (post-Sydney) situation the way he has done. 
    
	On just how highly will Kumble be regarded among Indian captains 
    
	Kumble shouldve got the captaincy two years ago... The team wouldve been better for that as he wouldve taken the pressure off the others... Because hes such a professional, its easy for him to lead from the front. 
    
	On whether, with three seamers in the XI, he wouldve batted at the Waca 
    
	It was a bold decision and Kumble read the wicket very well... Having said that, I dont think bowling first wouldve made much of a difference. 
    
	On the turning point 
    
	Indias batting on the first day... We reached almost 300 and, in the context of the match, that made a big difference. Batting first at the Waca is never easy and we did really well. 
    
	On whether Virender Sehwags inclusion was a practical or an inspired move 
    
	Look, Ive always been for Sehwag... He adds value... Id only exclude him if he wasnt pulling his weight. If I was the captain, Id gamble with him all the time, irrespective of what people wrote or the public opinion. 
    
	On the last Test, in Adelaide 
    
	No matter what happens there, the Indians have done enough to hold their heads high... (After a pause) Australia tour India next season and, in my opinion, that will be the last time theyll start a tour of India as favourites. 
    
	Finally, on his emotions 
    
	As an Indian, very proud and the boys deserve all the credit. Well done!

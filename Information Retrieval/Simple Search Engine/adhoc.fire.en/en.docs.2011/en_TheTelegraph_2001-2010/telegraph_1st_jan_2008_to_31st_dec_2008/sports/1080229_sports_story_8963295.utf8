The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal cleared in crash probe
                                                   Atwal cleared in crash probe
                      
	Gurgaon: Florida police have cleared Arjun Atwal of speed racing charges. The car crash in Orlando, where the Indian golfer lives, marred his season last year.         
	The (investigation) report went to the state attorneys office two weeks ago and last week I got a call from my lawyer saying they have thrown all the charges out. So, I am clear, Atwal told reporters on Thursday.         
	The 33-year-old pro, who lost his US PGA Tour card and then barely managed to retain his Nationwide card last season, ended up adding to his woes by being involved in a crash that left one dead. Atwal was not injured in the accident.         
	According to witnesses, Atwal and the deceased, 48-year-old Noah Park, were allegedly street racing. Atwal and Park apparently lost control on a curve on a suburban road that is a popular shortcut between the Disney resorts and upscale communities west of Orlando.         
	Atwal, who was the first Indian to play on the US PGA Tour, denied having been involved in any race and said also denied having known Park.         
	He said the controversy had taken a mental toll on him. It was a lot distracting for me to play golf with. You know, the investigation hanging over my head... Even though I knew everything was going to be okay.         
	But now that he has been cleared, Atwal said he could finally move on. It is a pain when you have to deal with other things besides golf, and luckily, you know, everything is sorted out now. So I can go back to concentrating on golf, he said. (Agencies)

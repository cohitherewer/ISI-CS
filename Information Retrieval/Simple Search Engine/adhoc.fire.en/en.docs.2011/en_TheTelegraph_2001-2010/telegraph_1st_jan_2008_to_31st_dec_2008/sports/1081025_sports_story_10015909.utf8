	Basel: Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles moved into the quarter finals of the Swiss Indoor meet on Thursday (as reported in Fridays Late City edition).         
	The second seeds had no difficulty in dumping Spaniards Marcel Granollers and Feliciano Lopez 6-4, 6-1 in their first round match.         
	They next face Jordan Kerr of Australia and Finn Jarko Nieminen for a place in the semi-finals.         
	Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy, however, crashed out. The third-seeded Indo-Czech pair were stunned by unseeded Germans Christopher Kas and Philipp Kohlschreiber 3-6, 0-6 in the quarter finals.         
	In singles action, Roger Federer stuttered into the quarter finals of his hometown tournament after an unexpectedly tough 7-6, 7-6 second round win over Nieminen.         
	Federer will now face unseeded Italian Simone Bolelli in the quarter finals, after the world No. 42 won his second round match against Granollers 6-4, 6-2.         
	Federers win completed a successful day for the top players with Argentine second and third seeds David Nalbandian and Juan Martin Del Potro and American fourth seed James Blake also booking quarter final places.         
	Nalbandian had to work even harder than Federer, going to a third set tiebreak against Belgian qualifier Kristof Vliegen before winning 6-4, 5-7, 7-6.           (AGENCIES)

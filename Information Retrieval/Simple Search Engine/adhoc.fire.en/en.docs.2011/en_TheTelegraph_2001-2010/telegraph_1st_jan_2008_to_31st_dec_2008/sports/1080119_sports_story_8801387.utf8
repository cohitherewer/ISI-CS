                                                   Mauresmo, Roddick shocked

           
	Melbourne: Andy Roddick and Amelie Mauresmo were jettisoned from the Australian Open on Friday, beaten by unheralded journeymen on the bleakest of nights for the former world number ones. 
    
	Mauresmo and her fragile temperament succumbed to the tenacity of homegrown baseliner Casey Dellacqua while Roddicks brittle gameplan was picked apart by little-known but gifted German Philipp Kohlschreiber. 
    
	The night shocks came hard on the heels of a day session which had proved fertile for the seeds  Justine Henin, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal all winning  and provided much needed drama at the seasons opening Grand Slam. 
    
	Roddicks demise, a fittingly dramatic, explosive and bad-tempered 4-6, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 6-8 loss as moths fluttered in the early hours of the Melbourne morning, illustrated the danger the worlds best face every time they step on court. 
    
	Roddick had no answer to the man in the luminous green shirt with the sledgehammer backhand. 
    
	Frustration filled him. He shouted at himself, at the umpire, at the crowd. Nothing worked and, despite a career-best 42 aces in a match, he folded just after 2.00am. 
    
	Kohlschreiber has Jarkko Nieminen in his sights next.. 
    
	Dellacqua has neither the court-craft nor the shot-making of Kohlschreiber, yet she captivated Melbourne Park and filled local hearts with pride by beating the fragile Frenchwoman. 
    
	Giant-killers had been in short supply at the years first Grand Slam and so it continued as Day 5 opened with champion Serena and top seed Henin slicing through to the fourth round. 
    
	They were joined by fifth seed Maria Sharapova, number three Jelena Jankovic, mens second seed Nadal and number four Nikolay Davydenko. 
    
	With the tournament free-wheeling along smoothly, few expected Dellacqua to jam such a stick in the spokes but she upended Mauresmo with free hitting and brave counter attacking. 
    
	Mauresmo, seeded 18th after a spell of injuries, acknowledged that her lack of confidence had proved a factor. 
    
	Henin advanced by beating tricky Italian Francesca Schiavone 7-5, 6-4. 
    
	Henin, who has now won 31 consecutive matches since losing in last years Wimbledon semi-finals to Marion Bartoli, meets Hsieh Su-wei for a place in the quarters after the Taiwanese player ousted Frances Aravane Rezai. 
    
	Williams eased through with a routine 6-3, 6-4 win over Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and next up for her is 12th-seeded Czech Nicole Vaidisova. 
    
	Jankovic shrugged off fatigue and nagging injuries to beat Virginie Razzano 6-2, 4-6, 6-1 and Sharapova swatted aside Elena Vesnina 6-3, 6-0. 
    
	Nadal shrugged off a slow start to overwhelm Frenchman Gilles Simon 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 and line up a meeting with 23rd seed Paul-Henri Mathieu of France. (Reuters)

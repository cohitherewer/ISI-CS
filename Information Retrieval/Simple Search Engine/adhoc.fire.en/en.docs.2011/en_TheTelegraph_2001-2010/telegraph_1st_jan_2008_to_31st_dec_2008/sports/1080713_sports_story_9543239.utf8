The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB approaches Syed Kirmani
                                                                                                                                                                                                       CAB approaches Syed Kirmani
            A STAFF REPORTER            Syed Kirmani                           
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has approached Indias World Cup winning wicketkeeper Syed Kirmani to take over as Bengal coach this season.         
	The move came after Woorkeri Raman, who had talks with the CAB officials in the city earlier this week, decided to stay with his home association, Tamil Nadu.         
	We had to hurry up things after we learnt that Raman is not available, a top CAB official said on Saturday. CAB president Prasun Mukherjee had a meeting with Kirmani when he was in town this week in connection with a promotional.         
	Now we are left with very little options. Every other coach is already committed, he added. It was learnt that the former India wicketkeeper hasnt yet confirmed his availability to the CAB. The CAB isnt keen on a local coach.         
	The players will not listen to a local coach and so we are keen to have one from outside, the official said. When contacted Kirmani, who was a short-term coach for Karnataka, refused comment on this development.

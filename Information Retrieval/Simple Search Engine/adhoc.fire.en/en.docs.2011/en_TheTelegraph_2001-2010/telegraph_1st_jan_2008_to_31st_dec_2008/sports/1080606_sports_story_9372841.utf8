The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Slapgate row wont affect spirit: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Slapgate row wont affect spirit: Dhoni
                  Mahendra Singh Dhoni                     
	New Delhi: Indian one-day International skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Thursday said the slapgate row will not affect the dressing room environment when banned spinner Harbhajan Singh returns to the team and assured that he would not allow repeat of any such incident in future.         
	It would be the job of the captain, the coach and the supporting staff to ensure that nothing of this sort happens. I dont think it should have happened. We as a team, our coach and supporting staff go along very well and I dont think something of this sort will happen again, Dhoni said.         
	Harbhajan, who is serving a five ODI ban for slapping teammate S Sreesanth during an Indian Premier League (IPL) match, will be missing the Bangladesh series and will be eligible to make a comeback to the national side in the later half of the Asia cup to be held in Pakistan.         
	Dhoni also rued that the IPL would be remembered more for controversies and skirmishes on the field than the quality of cricket that was on display.         
	We saw some great cricket in the IPL but it is very unfortunate that it is being remembered more for the cheerleaders and the slapgate controversy, Dhoni said.         
	Dhoni, who successfully led the Chennai Super Kings to the final of the IPL before losing against the Rajasthan Royals on the last ball, showered praise on Shane Warne for his deft handling of the team and said there was much to learn from the veteran spin wizard.         
	There is a lot to learn from Warne. The way he motivated the boys, made bowling changes, he is someone who is never afraid of taking risk. He has played both against and with many captains and has a lot of experience. I feel one can learn loads from him, not only as a captain but also as a cricketer, Dhoni said.         
	Asked to comment on railway minister Lalu Prasads remarks that he was paying more importance to his hairstyle and advertisement than playing his swashbuckling style of cricket, Dhoni replied in lighter vein.         
	It is important that I have got the attention of the man. I dont have anything to give him back. He is a great guy, he said.           (PTI)

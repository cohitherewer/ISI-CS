            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung                           
	New Delhi: Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia, who will leave for Munich on Thursday night to participate in the goal4Africa charity match, was given a warm send off by his teammates in Portugal.         
	National coach Bob Houghton has also exempted the team captain from playing the second friendly match against GD Gafanha. He has asked Bhutia to concentrate on the Munich tie.         
	In Munich, the Indian striker is expected to play alongside world stars like Kaka, Steven Gerrard, Gianluigi Buffon, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Michael Essien and Didier Drogba. The match is organised by AC Milan midfielder Clarence Seedorf on behalf of the goal4Africa project to help and improve education in Africa.         
	Goal4Africa will continue through to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and its kick-off is timed to celebrate the 90th birthday of Nelson Mandela on July 18.         
	It is a great feeling to be selected in such a star-studded team, Bhaichung said. I will do my best. After all, the match is being organised for a noble cause. My aim would be to play well so that people realise Indian football has a good standard.         
	Bhaichung, who is carrying a slight hamstring injury, has been advised by Houghton to be careful during the match. You dont need to play the match against GD Gafanha, Houghton told Bhutia.         
	You should remember that this invitation has come to you because you have played the game with honesty and dedication for the past 15 years. It is a recognition for your hard work, Houghton said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Carrick eager to seize chance
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Carrick eager to seize chance
            Henry Winter   The Daily Telegraph                      
	When Paul Gascoigne was starring at Italia 90, Gabriel Agbonlahor was three years old, Michael Mancienne two and Theo Walcott only 15 months but for the more mature members of the England squad flying out to Berlin on Tuesday, Gazzas pyrotechnics lit the fire within. I have kept dreaming of the World Cup ever since, reflected Michael Carrick on Monday.         
	The Manchester United midfielder had just come in from training at London Colney, his hair still wet, and he found himself walking into a storm about club versus country, about players commitment to the national cause. As calmly as he propels a ball around Old Trafford, Carrick was sure-footed in dealing with the debate, speaking warmly of how Gascoigne and Peter Beardsley stirred his desire to become a professional footballer.         
	Now 27, Carricks elegant style was nurtured at Wallsend Boys Club, giving him automatic affiliation to Newcastle United. Gascoigne and Beardsley wore the famous black-and-white stripes when Carrick was falling in love with football but it was primarily their England deeds that caught and held his imagination.         
	I always looked up to Paul Gascoigne and Peter Beardsley, coming from that area, said Carrick. One of my first big memories of football was Italia 90, watching that and dreaming that, one day maybe that could be me. That really sticks in my mind.         
	Gazza was more about England for me because Italia 90 was a big thing for me. I appreciated Peter Beardsley for the way he played. The dream was always England and the World Cup. The start was Italia 90 and I have kept dreaming of the World Cup ever since.         
	Savvy enough to avoid any criticism of those who failed to make Tuesdays flight to Berlin, Carrick articulated his own passion for England. Im desperate to play. To play for your country is a massive honour. Its not a meaningless friendly. Germany versus England at any level is a huge game. Were taking an awful lot of fans across there and were not taking it lightly.         
	But what of his Scottish manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, not a man noted for a deep longing to end 42 years of English hurt? Youre going away to play for your country  hes not too interested in that, said Carrick. He has got his own agenda and there are things to be won at domestic level. But, as players, you have to put that to one side until Thursday morning. Hes never put me under pressure not to play in a friendly.         
	Carrick appreciates that the absence of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard presents him with a glorious chance to show what he can do.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

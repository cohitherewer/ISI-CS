            A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta: It will be a battle of wits between Karim Bencharifa and David Booth, two of the wiliest foreign coaches operating in the country at the moment, as Mohun Bagan take on Mumbai FC in their opening I-League encounter on Saturday at the Barasat stadium.         
	The relatively young Mumbai-based side, boasting of the likes of Abhishek Yadav and the Ghanaian forward Felix, had come down to the city almost a week ahead of the tie, to prepare themselves.         
	Mohun Bagan, meanwhile, will be looking to carry on from where they left off in the Sahara Calcutta Football League.         
	Bencharifa will have almost the same side at his disposal that did so well in the local league. On Saturday, though, the much feared and fancied strike force of Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Barreto are certain to start upfront for the first time this season, with P.C. Lalawmpuiya operating behind them.         
	Bagan will have to hold fort well, if they are to keep out Mumbai FCs strikers. Peter Odafe and Deepak Mondal will have to share most of the defensive responsibility.

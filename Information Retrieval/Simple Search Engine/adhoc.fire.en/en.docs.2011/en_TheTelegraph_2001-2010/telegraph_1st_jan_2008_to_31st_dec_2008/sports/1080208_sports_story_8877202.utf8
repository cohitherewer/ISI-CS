                                                Randhawa soars to lead 
    - INDIAN MASTERS 
  - SHIV KAPUR IN JOINT FOURTH SPOT; ERNIE ELS STRUGGLES                             
	New Delhi: Local favourite Jyoti Randhawa fired a seven-under-par 65 to take a two-shot lead after the Indian Masters first round on Thursday while world No. 4 Ernie Els struggled to a 75.         
	Randhawa, who won the Asian Tours Indian Open at the same Delhi Golf Club (DGC) venue in 2006 and 2007, mixed two eagles at the 14th and 18th with three birdies in a flawless display that fetched him a two-shot lead over second-placed Damien McGrane of Ireland and Richard Finch of England.         
	After an impeccable front nine, where he picked up a shot each on the third and sixth holes, Randhawa birdied the 12th and parred the next. On the 14th, he fired an eagle and then went on to sign off in style, with yet another eagle amid loud cheers.         
	Meanwhile, having played the last two rounds of the Dubai Desert Classic with Tiger Woods seemed to have done a world of good for McGrane. The stocky Irish player unleashed seven birdies, as against two bogeys, to share the second spot with Finch who mixed five birdies, an eagle and two bogeys in his round.         
	Local lad Shiv Kapur reeled off seven birdies, against three bogeys, in a see-saw round of 68 to be tied fourth. I think 68 is par for the course. We golfers are quite greedy you know, we always want more, he said.         
	Kapur felt he blossomed late. Initially, I was scratching around and was even over-par at a stage. My swing was not great and I started with a few errant shots. But the rhythm came back and I felt on song over the final 8-9 holes, said the European Tour regular.         
	Thomas Bjorn shunned extravaganza and stuck to a conservative gameplan to return an identical card. Playing his back nine first, the Ryder Cup star fired three birdies on his front nine and picked up two more shots on his way back before came the lone blot in an otherwise perfect card via a final hole bogey.         
	Bangalore-based C. Muniyappa aced the par-three 12th hole en route to 69 to be tied seventh.         
	Like Randhawa, Arjun Atwal is not an admirer of DGCs new look but still returned 70 to remain in the hunt. Atwal dropped a couple of shots on his front nine but a birdie quintet eventually brought him home. Compatriots S.S.P. Chowrasia and Harmeet Kahlon joined him at tied 17th.         
	However, it was a completely different story with Jeev Milkha Singh, who began with a birdie but did not get another opportunity to rejoice. What followed is a strenuous struggle and six bogeys which he spread equally on both nines to return 77 and slump to tied 103rd.         
	Top draw Els dominated the discussion, for the shocker of a quadruple-bogey nine at the par-five 18th hole en route to a forgettable 75.         
	At the 18th, an erratic Els saw helplessly as the Bush twice swallowed the ball and the unplayable lies resulted in two penalty drops before the world No. 4 two-putted to end his misery. The world No. 4 did reel off five birdies but a bogey quintet, and that 18th hole nightmare, blighted his round.         
	Among the star players, Jose Manuel Lara carded 68, one stroke ahead of Mark Meara, while Darren Clarke settled for an even-par round, two shots ahead of David Howell. (PTI)

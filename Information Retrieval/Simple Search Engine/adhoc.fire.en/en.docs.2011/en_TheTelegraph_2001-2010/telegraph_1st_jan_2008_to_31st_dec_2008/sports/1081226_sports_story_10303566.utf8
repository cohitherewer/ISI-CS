The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lahiri leads, Gangjee second
                                                                                                                                                                                           Lahiri leads, Gangjee second
                                  Rahil Gangjee         
	Greater Noida: Jeev Milkha Singh sizzled with a five-under 67 but it was rookie Anirban Lahiri who set the greens ablaze with a flawless seven under 65 to grab the opening round lead in the Rs 80 lakh Bilt Open here on Thursday.         
	Calcutta pro Rahil Gangjee blasted a six-under 66 to grab the second spot after the weather-hit opening round of the PGTI event.         
	In a field which boasts of stalwarts like Jyoti Randhawa, Shiv Kapur, Gaurav Ghei and SSP Chowrasia among others, Lahiri stole the thunder, setting a one-stroke lead at the end of days play with 21 golfers yet to finish their first round.         
	The 21-year-old Lahiri was off the block with a birdie on the first hole and picked up two more shots at the fifth and seventh to take the turn at three-under.         
	On resumption, the Bangalore golfer picked up a couple of birdies at the 11th and 12th and after parring the next two holes, fired another birdie brace on the 15th and 16th for a highly satisfying round.         
	The 15th hole birdie was the best. It was my longest putt of the day, Lahiri said. I didnt do anything spectacular. I just tried to get the basics right and hit the greens. I planned my rounds well. It was very satisfying, I managed the par fives well, the former Asian games silver medallist Lahiri said.         
	The course is playing really well, there are not much roughs. There is not much wind but because of the fog in the morning the visibility was low. I think the fog will play its part in the next three days, he added.         
	While Lahiri sizzled in the morning, Gangjee came up with an illuminating performance in fading lights.         
	Gangjee followed up a birdie-birdie start by picking up one more shot on the fourth to take the turn at three-under. On his backward journey, he picked up three more birdies on the 12th, 15th and 18th for his blemish-free round.         
	In contrast, a 10th tee starter Jeev had a shaky start as he stumbled on the first hole before making amends, picking up birdies on the 12th, 13th and 15th.         
	On his front nine journey, Jeev picked up a birdie at the second but stumbled on the next before hitting a birdie brace at the fourth and fifth before gaining another shot at the seventh.         
	I am happy with my round. The course is playing excellent and the bunkers are very well placed. Here you need to be a very good driver. Lets see what happens in the next three days, Jeev said.         
	It is the end of the year and so it is very difficult to concentrate and stay focussed, but I am satisfied with my performance here so far. The best birdie was the seventh hole, one where my shot touched the post flag and sloped back as I had to take a 15 feet putt, he added.         
	Shamim Khan, who holds the second spot in the PGTI Order of Merit, blasted an identical five-under 67 studded with five birdies to grab the third position along with Jeev.         
	Randhawa rode on his flawless back nine to card a four-under 68 to lie tied fifth along with Gaganjeet Bhullar, Chowrasia, Kapur, Ghei and Mohammed Siddikur Rahman of Bangladesh.         
	Out of 118 golfers, only 97 golfers could finish their round and 21 will return on Friday to complete their first round before teeing off the second round. (PTI)

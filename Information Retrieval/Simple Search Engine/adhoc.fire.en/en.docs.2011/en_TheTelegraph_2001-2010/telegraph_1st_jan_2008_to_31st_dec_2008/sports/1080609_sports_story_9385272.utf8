The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Italians, Dutch have injury worries
                                                                                                                                                                                           Italians, Dutch have injury worries
                      
	Berne: Italy and The Netherlands will be relieved to play for real on Monday after a string of injuries in training upset their Euro 2008 preparations.         
	Dutch winger Arjen Robben will miss their group C opener against the world champions in Berne because of a groin problem while Ryan Babel is out of the tournament and forward Robin van Persie is struggling for general fitness. Italy have been almost as unlucky with captain Fabio Cannavaro out of the finals after tearing ankle ligaments last week and fellow defender Christian Panucci suffering a knee injury.         
	Even without the injuries, Italys starting line-up is far from clear after coach Roberto Donadoni experimented in the 3-1 win over Belgium last month, his only friendly in the fortnight leading up to the tournament.         
	Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is expected to be named captain in Cannavaros absence, especially with striker Alessandro Del Piero poised to start on the bench if Donadoni sticks with his favoured three-pronged attack.         
	Dutch coach Marco van Basten has plenty of thinking to do after Robbens injury in Saturdays training.

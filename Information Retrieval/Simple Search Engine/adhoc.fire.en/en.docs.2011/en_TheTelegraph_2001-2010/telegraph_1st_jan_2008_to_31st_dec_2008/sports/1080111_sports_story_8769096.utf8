                                                   Tough criteria for second division teams

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
           
	New Delhi: The AIFF seems determined to make things tougher for clubs in the second division I-League this season. 
    
	In a letter to some of these clubs recently, the AIFF project director has asked them to meet a 15-point guideline, failing which the clubs might lose the chance to play the second division league. 
    
	The criteria include things like details of permanent staff for marketing, media and event management (preferably their resume) and fan development and community development initiatives, something that not even the Premier Division I-League clubs have been exercising sincerely. 
    
	Unperturbed, the letter concludes with a clear warning to the clubs. It says: Kindly note that inability to meet any of the above criteria would significantly reduce the chances of getting the provisional club license for participation in the Second Division I-League. 
    
	According to AIFF sources, very few clubs have replied to the letter till date though the last date for submission has passed at least a month ago. 
    
	Alokesh Kundu, a senior official of the Chirag United felt the AIFF might find it difficult to push through the agenda. 
    
	To ask an Indian club to submit copy of the clubs written agreement with the stadium authority and details of community development initiatives is bit impractical, he said. I am not sure how many of those professional league can survive the scrutiny on those lines, he quipped. 
    
	Another club official was of the view that the AIFF was going overboard trying to back a few company backed clubs, which have come up in the last one year. 
    
	No doubt, the newly-formed clubs are administratively strong and they should be encouraged, he said. But it wont be good for football if the traditional clubs get eliminated.

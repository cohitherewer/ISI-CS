The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chopra predicts tougher days
                                                                                                                                                                                           Chopra predicts tougher days
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: India-born Swede golfer Daniel Chopra, who was placed second at the end of the second day of the Indian Open on Friday, said things would be tougher in the next two days.         
	I expect the pins to be tougher over the weekend. They would be more difficult than the first two days, said Chopra, who had a good day at the office at the picturesque Delhi Golf Club (DGC).         
	A bad tee shot on the eighth, which culminated into a double-bogey, was the lone blot on his card that was studded with four birdies in a flawless back nine.         
	Frankly, I played much better than what the score suggests, he said. I just have to keep doing what I have done so far and get some birdies out there. I would like to be in a position where I have a chance. Right now, I am happy with the way the first two days have gone. I want the next two to be similar, Chopra added.         
	It is generally an intimidating golf course and I never thought I would be here to play in a tournament where someone scores a 60. Then I see an 11-under on day two from a Dutch pro, Guido. Its awesome, said Chopra.

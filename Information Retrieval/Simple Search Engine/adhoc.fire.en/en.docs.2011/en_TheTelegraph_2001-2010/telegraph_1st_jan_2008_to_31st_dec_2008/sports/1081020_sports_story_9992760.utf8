The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mishra pins Aussies on mat
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mishra pins Aussies on mat
    - Sehwag, Gambhir run amok as India take 301-run lead           SUDIPTO GANGULY                            
	Mohali: Amit Mishra picked up five wickets in his debut Test to help India put Australia on the mat in the second Test on Sunday. With two days remaining, the Indians are already ahead by 301 runs, with all their second-innings wickets intact.         
	The Indians bundled out Australia for 268 in the first innings to take a lead of 201 runs and then openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir piled on the misery, raking up 100 runs in only 23 overs.         
	The flamboyant Sehwag has a quick-fire 53 and Gambhir is on 46.         
	The world champions will have to devise a way to stop India from scoring too freely. The Indians will definitely come out all guns blazing on Monday and try to score as quickly as possible to extend their lead.         
	Australia fell two runs short of the follow-on mark of 270 but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni decided against enforcing it to give some rest to his bowlers and make the visitors bat last.         
	The Mohali pitch has already started offering a lot of turn for the spinners and the Australians will have to play out of their skins to save the Test match.         
	Allrounder Shane Watson, who failed to make a mark with the ball in Indias first innings, top-scored for the visitors with a patient 78.         
	He saved Australia more blushes with a 73-run partnership with Brett Lee. He became one of Mishras victims  ruled lbw.         
	The ball was of a similar kind that trapped Michael Clarke leg before on Saturday. It pitched on the leg stump, straightened and hit Watson in line with the stumps.         
	Mishra, who became the sixth Indian to pick up five wickets in an innings in his debut Test, extracted vicious turn from the pitch and with a bit more control can prove to be an able partner for Harbhajan, after Anil Kumble decides to call it a day.         
	After Mishras performance on Sunday, the team management and the selectors will no doubt have a lot on their plate when they sit down to pick the playing XI for the third Test in Delhi, starting on October 29.         
	With captain Kumble likely to be fit by then, it has to be seen if Mishra is dropped to accommodate Kumble or played as a third spinner.         
	India would have to play a batsman less in case they decide to play five bowlers  two fast bowlers and three spinners.         
	Speedster Ishant has given India a lot to cheer about of late. The right-arm fast bowler has ensured that India dont need to wait for the spinners only to pick up a wicket on a third-day pitch. The 20-year-old has a bright future ahead and it was evident from the way he dismissed the dangerous Mike Hussey (54).         
	Hussey, who had also survived an edge off Ishant on Saturday, brought up his half century pulling him to the square leg boundary. But the speedster had his revenge almost immediately.         
	The very next ball he got another edge off Hussey, which didnt carry to Dhoni. But the left-hander was not so lucky on the next ball. The ball moved away after pitching, took the edge of Husseys bat and safely went into the waiting gloves of the wicketkeeper.         
	Ishant also bowled a fiery spell with the second new ball and sent down some vicious bouncers to Lee. The Australian, who is no mug with the bat, survived the spell to bring his team closer to saving the follow-on.         
	Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (9) got bogged down and went for an expensive cover drive only to be castled by Harbhajan Singh. The ball spun back from outside the off-stump to crash into the stumps, finding a gap between Haddins bat and ball.         
	Harbhajan also picked up Lee (35), caught by Rahul Dravid at slips. Lee played a crucial innings, which contained six boundaries.         
	Australian leg-spinner Cameron White (5) walked out at the fall of Haddin. He had a brief stay at the crease and was foxed by his counterpart Mishra.         
	The debutant, who had picked up two wickets on Saturday, got his googly to land on the right spot to breach Whites defence.         
	Another googly gave Mishra his fifth wicket of the innings when Peter Siddle advanced down the track to completely miss the ball and Dhoni completed an easy stumping.         
	The Indian captain looked in complete control of the situation on Sunday against the mighty Australians. He didnt allow the game to drift and looks an ideal heir to the throne of India Test captaincy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Challengers up against Kings XI 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Challengers up against Kings XI 
                      
	Bangalore: On a roll after four back-to-back wins, Kings XI Punjab start overwhelming favourites against the beleaguered Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL here on Monday.         
	Going into Mondays match, Yuvraj Singhs Kings XI Punjab seems to be the only team that has not been affected by the exit of its Australian imports  Simon Katich and Brett Lee.         
	In contrast, Bangalore lost their only consistent performer in Ross Taylor when the New Zealand opener had to leave for national duty against England.         
	Much is expected from Taylors replacement Misbah-ul Haq but the Pakistani right-hander has played only one game and that too without much success.         
	The Rahul Dravid-led outfit has managed just two wins in the high-profile Twenty20 tourney so far and they have come against teams that are not exactly in great touch either  Mumbai Indians and Hyderabad Deccan Chargers.         
	Kings XI, on the other hand, lost their first two encounters but bounced back brilliantly to remain unbeaten thereafter, brushing aside controversies like the slap-gate involving its pacer Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh.         
	Their last win came against the more-fancied Kolkata Knight Riders and they discovered a match-winner in Australian Shaun Marsh, son of Geoff Marsh, who became Man of the Match on debut against Deccan Chargers.         
	The bowling too has not been affected much by Lees departure and Irfan Pathan has taken over as the pace spearhead with elan.         
	The only cause of concern remains Sreesanths economy rate and aggression, none of which has not shown any signs of coming down.         
	Bangalore, meanwhile, can take heart from Praveen Kumars allround performance. The UP player has been effective with the bat and ball and was the Man of the Match of their last win over Deccan Chargers.         
	However, the hosts desperately need somebody to strike form at the top. Although Wasim Jaffer, Jacques Kallis and Rahul Dravid have been scoring consistently, their strike rates have been too slow for the slam-bang version.         
	This has put additional burden on keeper-batsman Mark Boucher, who is left with too many runs to score in the last few overs after the top order fails to put on any substantial score on the board.         
	But despite these shortcomings, the Royal Challengers would be hoping to spring a surprise and register their second successive win at home.

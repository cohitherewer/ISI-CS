	Karachi: The 10th edition of the Asia Cup, in 2010, will he held outside the four Test-playing nations of the region.         
	Thats the agreement in principle, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief executive, Syed Ashraful Haq, told The Telegraph on Sunday afternoon, after the bodys AGM.         
	Seven members  Hong Kong, Kuwait, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand and the UAE  are in the tier just below the Big Four (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh).         
	The next tier has 11 members.         
	Haq, who received the ACCs Lifetime Achievement Award (Administrators) for Bangladesh, during Saturday nights awards ceremony, said that no decision had been taken on whether the awards would be a regular feature.         
	It was done this time because of the 25th-year celebrations of the ACC... The future of the awards, though, has to be decided by our board, Haq pointed out.         
	Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf, has taken over from Arjuna Ranatunga as the ACCs president.         
	The vice-presidency has gone to Malaysias P. Krishnaswamy. The posts get rotated.

	As the clouds of suspicion darkened around the suspension of seven Russian runners ahead of next weeks Olympic Games, the chances of athletes being able to manipulate urine samples for drug testing in this country were deemed impossible by a UK Sport official on Friday night.         
	The seven Russians, have been suspended following a lengthy and complicated investigation by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).         
	The governing bodys investigation ran into a couple of years, although there was always a deadline looming .         
	By using DNA testing, the IAAF assert that the urine provided in Moscow last week did not come from the athletes named on their declaration forms.         
	The suspicion is that either the drug testers were at fault or that the women had used sophisticated methods of providing them with a clean urine sample that was not their own.         
	A spokesman for UK Sport, who administer drug testing for the Olympic sports in this country, insisted, however, that it would be impossible for athletes to get away with such manipulation here.         
	The IAAF will monitor carefully the outcome of the investigations which will be conducted after the Olympics by the All Russia Athletics Federation.         
	The doping cases in Russia and Romania, where three female 1500m runners have also been suspended, could be said to reflect the special pressure that comes in an Olympic year.         
	The UK Sport spokesman added that the pressure to succeed in London will intensify once the Beijing Olympics close on August 24.         
	The spectre of doping will never be far away, even when the Games get underway next Friday.         
	The International Olympic Committee confirmed that 4,500 drug tests will be carried out, with president Jacques Rogge predicting that around 40 will come up positive.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

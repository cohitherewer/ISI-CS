                                          Bond joins   ICL  Mumbai: New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond has joined the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) in a move that could jeopardise his international career.
  ldquo;Shane Bond has signed up, rdquo; ICL official Ashish Kaul said on Friday. ldquo;It rsquo;s a three-year contract that he has signed with the Indian Cricket League, rdquo; the executive vice-president of ICL promoters Essel Group added. Bond is widely regarded as New Zealand rsquo;s best fast bowler after Richard Hadlee and his departure would be a huge blow to the national team.  Bond becomes the seventh New Zealand international to join the ICL, which is not sanctioned by the International Cricket Council.

	 Ramiz appeal to ICC  Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja has urged the ICC to step in and convince Australia not to cancel their tour of Pakistan in March, saying the onus was on the governing body to make sure that members fulfil their international commitments. Ramiz declared Pakistan a perfectly safe country to host international matches.
  ldquo;I think the ICC has a big role to play in convincing teams who are reluctant to tour Pakistan, rdquo; he said. Ramiz also urged the PCB to elevate Misbah-ul Haq to Test captaincy, while retaining Shoaib Malik as leader of the one-day side.  
	Pak players move court  Karachi: Pakistani Test players Imran Farhat and Taufiq Umar have filed a petition against the PCB for banning them from playing domestic cricket matches. The PCB banned Farhat and Umar last month after they returned from India after playing in the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). The plea would be heard on Monday, the players rsquo; lawyer Imran Aziz said. He said both players had asked the court to declare the board rsquo;s action, which also excludes them from national team selection, as unconstitutional.

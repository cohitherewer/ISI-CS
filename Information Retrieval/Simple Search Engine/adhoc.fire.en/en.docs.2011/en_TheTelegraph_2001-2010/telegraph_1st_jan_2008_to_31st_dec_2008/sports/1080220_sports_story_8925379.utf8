                    Steve Waugh                
	Melbourne: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh is concerned that India would become an even bigger monetary force in world cricket with the launch of Indian Premier League (IPL), tailor-made for the fans.         
	Theres a bit of a concern I guess as to how much power one nation can have and theyre fanatical about cricket Theyre only going to get bigger, theyre only going to make more money, Waugh said.         
	The ex-Australian batsman also issued a warning to Indian authorities to take care that Test cricket did not lose its identity in the age of twenty20 leagues.         
	Whoever is running Indian cricket has a big responsibility to make sure that the tradition of the game is maintained.         
	Weve just got to make sure theres no danger to Test match cricket. Thats up to the authorities, to make sure that it doesnt take over, Waugh was quoted as saying in an Australian daily.

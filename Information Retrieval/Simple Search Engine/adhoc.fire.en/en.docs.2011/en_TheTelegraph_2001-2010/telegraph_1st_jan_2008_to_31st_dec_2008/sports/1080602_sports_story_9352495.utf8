The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All 1.05m tickets   sold out
                                                                                                                                                                                                     All 1.05m tickets   sold out
                            
	Vienna: The European Championship is sold out.         
	Euro 2008 chief operating officer Martin Kallen said all 1.05 million tickets for the 31-match tournament in Austria and Switzerland that starts Saturday have been sold, and that anyone buying a ticket from now is doing so illegally.         
	All tickets have been sold, not one single one left  and havent been so for a while, Kallen said Sunday. We are obviously trying to stop tickets from being sold on the black market. But all tickets now being sold are black-market tickets.         
	Euro 2008 organisers said 38 percent of the tickets went to national football federations, 33 percent to the general public, 14 percent to sponsors and TV partners, with the remaining 15 percent being broken up between hospitality, Uefa members and host city and stadium owner factions.         
	A ticket for the June 29 final at Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna will cost between $249 and $855, with all other matches selling from $70 to $171.         
	It goes without saying that the home teams add to the euphoria if they qualify, but in both countries there are lots of immigrant groups who live abroad, Kallen said. There are large groups of Croatians and Germans in Austria and Croatians and Spanish in Switzerland.

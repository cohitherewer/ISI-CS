	Istanbul: Adrian Sutil finished 16th for Force India after teammate Giancarlo Fisichellas campaign ended in the very first corner of the Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday.         
	Sutil, beginning at 19th position on the grid, recorded a timing of 1:27:51.473 to bring home one finish for Force India.         
	Italian Fisichella, who began at 20th, ran into the rear of Nakajimas Williams, causing irreparable suspension damage.         
	Adrian made a good start. However a Toro Rosso shut the door on him through turn five and damaged his front wing, forcing him to pit to change the nosecone.         
	With the safety car deployed to clear the stricken cars from the start line accident, Adrian rejoined at the rear of the field.         
	Sutil said he had troubles during the race but managed to finish the race thanks to good going in the middle.

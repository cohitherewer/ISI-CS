	Dresden: Indian medal hopes in the 32nd chess Olympiad suffered a severe jolt after the men could only manage a 2-2 draw with Slovenia while the women lost 1.5-2.5 to Serbia in the eighth round here.         
	For the men, Grandmaster P. Harikrishna scored over Dusko Pavasovic but on the fourth board GM Sandipan Chanda lost with white against Jure Borisec. The other two boards ended in draws.         
	Among the women, Tania Sachdev and Mary Ann Gomes ran out of steam and that cost the team dearly even as D. Harika struck hard on the top board and defeated Alisa Maric. (PTI)

                                                     Sania can break into top 10: Venus
                  Venus Williams                     
	Bangalore: Sania Mirza has got the potential to break into the top ten, says Venus Williams.         
	In an email interview, the American world No. 8 also said that she would miss the Indian at the $600,000 Bangalore Open starting on Monday.         
	Sania pulled out of the WTA Tier II event, saying she was hurt by the recent controversies surrounding her and that she was not in the right frame of mind to do justice to herself or her abilities.         
	Venus said, Definitely, I believe, a local player always adds to the excitement of the spectators. I recently played Sania in Australia and it is clear that she is talented and has got huge potential.         
	About the Bangalore Open, Venus said, My expectation is always to be the best I work too hard and have too much belief to expect anything less.         
	She believes that sister Serena will be her toughest opponent in Bangalore.         
	Serena knows my game better than anyone  we have practised together since we started playing  and I believe she has more weapons than anyone on the Tour.

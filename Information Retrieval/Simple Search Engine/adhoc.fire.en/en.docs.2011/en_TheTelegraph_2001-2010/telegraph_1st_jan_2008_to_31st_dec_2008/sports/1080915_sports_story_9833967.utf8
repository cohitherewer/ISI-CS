The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ive changed the game: Ronaldo
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ive changed the game: Ronaldo

	Rome: Manchester Uniteds Cristiano Ronaldo believes he changed the game by scoring 31 goals from midfield in the Premier League last season to win the European Golden Boot award.         
	With this Golden Boot I have changed football a little. Usually strikers won it and Im a winger, the Portugal international told an Italian daily after receiving the trophy on Saturday.         
	Ronaldo said he is confident of winning the Ballon dOr and Fifa World Player of the Year prizes after inspiring United to the Champions League-Premier League double last term.         
	The best candidate for the other prizes is Cristiano Ronaldo, the 23-year-old said.         
	To be honest, I think I have been the most consistent and the best. And over time I want to enter the book of the all-time best players.         
	Ronaldo, who has been sidelined since undergoing surgery on his right ankle in July, said he does not fear a hostile reception at Old Trafford after making an unsuccessful request to be sold to Real Madrid in the close season.         
	He also said it was unlikely he would move to Manchester City, after media reports linked him to a big money move to the cross-town rivals.                 (REUTERS)

	Ian Botham: Terrorism is something that we as a world need to stand up against and fight. It is sadly something weve got to live with and we have done so in places like England and India for many years. As far as Englands cricket tour goes, they have to take advice from the people around them but I think it would be a crying shame if they are forced to call things off at the hands of terrorists. We dont succumb to it in England and I do believe that if the team have the assurances of safety and security then why shouldnt they play?         
	NASSER HUSSAIN: If the rumours are true and they are not intending to return, it is imperative they (the ECB officials) make an announcement to that effect as soon as they arrive back. If they have decided to abandon the tour for safety reasons, that shows they are taking their duty of care for the players seriously. This is exactly what the ECB needed to do  take decisive action straightaway so the players werent left stewing in their hotel. They have shown strong leadership but must carry on being strong when they get home.         
	MIKE KASPROWICZ: Its impossible to describe how big cricket in India is to an Australian. They love the game and international cricket cannot afford to leave them out of the game. Its become a very important thing in world cricket and I know as far as players and player associations are concerned its almost naturally part of any tour these days. In England in 2005 we were heading to London the next day after the bombings happened and we sat down and spoke about it and a lot of us said thats it, time to go home.         
	GREG CHAPPELL: It will have a profound effect, I think, on cricket and where and how tournaments are conducted in the future, so its going to be a challenging time for everybody involved. I think that was the largest argument in favour of India, that there was a huge difference. In Pakistan Westerners were being targeted and in India theyre not, but thats changed, and from this day onwards therell always be that thought. A lot of people will be giving some thought about how to progress from here and I would think most players will wait and see.

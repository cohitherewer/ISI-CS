                                                                                                                                                                                           Donadoni to lose out if sacked
                      
	Rome: Italy coach Roberto Donadoni will receive no compensation if speculation that he is about to be sacked and replaced by predecessor Marcello Lippi proves to be true.         
	It had been rumoured that the Italian Soccer Federation (FIGC) would pay six months salary, an estimated $856,822, to terminate the two-year contract extension Donadoni signed prior to Italys unsuccessful Euro 2008 campaign.         
	However, the coach said he asked for the compensation package to be taken out of the deal.         
	I said no to the proposal that the president (of the FIGC Giancarlo Abete) made me on the day of the renewal, Donadoni said on Wednesday.         
	Im not interested in the economic side of things.         
	If Im no longer the coach for him, Ill go without asking for anything.         
	Italian media expect Abete to meet Donadoni over the next few days to discuss terminating his contract after the world champions Euro 2008 quarter final defeat by Spain on penalties.         
	According to reports, the FIGC are expected to announce early next week that 2006 World Cup-winning boss Lippi will return as Italy coach. (REUTERS)

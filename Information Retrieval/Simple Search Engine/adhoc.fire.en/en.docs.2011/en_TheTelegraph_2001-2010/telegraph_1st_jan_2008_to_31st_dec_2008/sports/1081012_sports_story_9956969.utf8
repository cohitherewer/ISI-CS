            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal striker Sunil Chhetri has been linked with a move to English League One side Leeds United.         
	The Yorkshire Post reported on Friday: Leeds United have expressed an interest in bringing one of the biggest names in Indian football, striker Sunil Chhetri, to the English game. India coach Bob Houghton has been instrumental in recommending Chhetris name to a number of Football League scouts, the report added.         
	When contacted, Chhetri, who has 34 international caps, said: Yes, I have read the reports, but nothing concrete has developed so far I have been talking to a lot of agents in London and hopefully something will come out soon.

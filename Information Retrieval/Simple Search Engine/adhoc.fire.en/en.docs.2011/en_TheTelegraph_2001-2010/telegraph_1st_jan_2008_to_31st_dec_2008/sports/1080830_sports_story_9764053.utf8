The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC move sad, says Akram
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ICC move sad, says Akram
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Wasim Akram                           
	New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram is extremely unhappy that the Champions Trophy in his country next month has been called off due to political problems.         
	Its a sad development, I must say, said Akram on Friday. I understand the concern about players safety, but the situation back in Pakistan is not that bad.         
	Akram, who was speaking on the sidelines of a seven-day camp for budding cricketers at the Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA), said he was surprised the way the other cricket-playing countries refused to play in Pakistan.         
	Their refusal to play in the Champions Trophy is a huge setback for the game in Pakistan. I am surprised the way South Africa behaved, Akram said.         
	They first agreed to play and then backed out. I dont know what the reason was. It is also unfortunate that England and Australia raised security concerns and pulled out.         
	Akram also criticised the PCB, saying it was in complete shambles and needed total overhauling.         
	The resignation of PBC chairman Nasim Ashraf has further complicated the problems, Akram commented.         
	Akram said he was disappointed with the performance of Shoaib Mailk as captain. I certainly felt let down. There was a time when I recommended his name for Pakistan captaincy. But he has not lived up to the expectations. He should be leading from the front.

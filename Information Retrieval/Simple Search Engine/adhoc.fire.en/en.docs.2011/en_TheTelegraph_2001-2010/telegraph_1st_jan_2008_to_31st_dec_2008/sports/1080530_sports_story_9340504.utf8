The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag: Difficult to regain momentum
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sehwag: Difficult to regain momentum
                  Virender Sehwag                     
	Mumbai: The onus is on the Delhi DareDevils players to execute the elaborate plans chalked out by the teams think-tank during their IPL semi-final against Rajasthan Royals, captain Virender Sehwag said on Friday.         
	Our planning is complete for the match and now we have to execute those plans. Both sides are equally matched, the flamboyant India opening batsman said a press conference ahead of the tie at the Wankhede Stadium.         
	The Delhi swashbuckler felt that regaining momentum once lost in this format was difficult. Its difficult to regain the momentum if we lose it in this format, he said.         
	About his batsmens prospects in facing the tournaments most successful bowler (21 wickets) Sohail Tanvir, Sehwag said the key was to play each ball on its merit.         
	We will play Tanvir on the merit of the ball (he delivers), he said.         
	Sehwag denied that his middle order was fragile pointing out how wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik (56 not out) and Manoj Tiwary (36 run out) had bailed the team out in their last week IPL tie against Mumbai Indians Sehwag said that his team had enough experience in the ranks to handle the pressure of a knock-out match which, he said, was different to the normal tie.         
	We have experienced international players like McGrath, Fervez Mahroof, Shoaib Malik, myself, Dinesh Karthik and others.         
	They know how to handle the pressure of a semi-final which is different from the pressure which exists in a normal tie, he said.         
	On Younis Khan, who has recently joined the rival ranks, the Delhi captain said that the experienced Pakistan player cannot be dismissed lightly in this format as he was capable of hitting a hundred in twenty overs.         
	Team adviser Dennis Lillee felt that the teams three matches were more or less finals and the experience would stand the squad in good stead.         
	To me its important that we played three finals to get here. If thats not good preparation for us nothing else is, he said referring to some crucial matches the team won after losing four in-a-row that put them under severe pressure.

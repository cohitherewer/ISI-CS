	Madrid: Valencia salvaged some pride from a miserable season by claiming their seventh Kings Cup with a 3-1 win over Getafe at the Calderon on Wednesday.         
	Ronald Koemans side, who have been dragged into the relegation battle after three successive league defeats, went 2-0 up within 12 minutes thanks to goals from Juan Mata and Alexis.         
	Getafe, who lost to Sevilla in last seasons final, pulled a goal back when midfielder Esteban Granero scored from the spot on the stroke of halftime.         
	The goal gave Michael Laudrups team a new lease of life and they put their opponents under severe pressure in the second half but it was Valencia who struck again, substitute Fernando Morientes heading in seven minutes from time.         
	The night ended on a low note for Getafe when midfielder Fabio Celestini was sent off just before the final whistle.         
	Defeat completed a heart-breaking week for Getafe who lost to Bayern Munich on the away goals rule in the Uefa Cup last Thursday.         
	Valencia, however, have put their celebrations on hold until after they have secured their Primera Liga safety, club president Agustin Morera said. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hiddinks Midas touch sees Russia through
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hiddinks Midas touch sees Russia through

	The Midas touch that Gus Hiddink has on international teams took Russia into the quarter finals of a major tournament for the first time on a night when his adopted team announced their capabilities by claiming the win they needed to progress. Now the man who took Holland to the World Cup semi-finals faces his country in a fascinating tie, in Basle, on Saturday (as briefly reported in Thursdays late City edition).         
	Hiddink took South Korea to the last four of the World Cup before reaching the finals and reaching the second stage with Australia, and while Sweden needed only a draw to qualify, it was soon apparent that the Russians were better equipped, with Roman Pavlyuchenko scoring midway through the first half. The outcome was effectively determined when Andrei Arshavin, restored after completing a two-match ban, capped a fluent display with Russias second.         
	Arshavin made a big impact in his first game of the tournament. The Zenit St Petersburg forward missed the defeat by Spain and win over Greece after being sent off in Russias final qualifier in Andorra.         
	Hiddink was concerned that Arshavin was short of match fitness but the prize was too great for the Dutchman not to take a chance and he replaced Dmitry Torbinsky.         
	Similarly, Sweden coach Lars Lagerback fielded the team unlucky to lose 2-1 to Spain on Saturday, and was relieved that Zlatan Ibrahimovic was able to continue, having failed to emerge for the second half against the Spaniards with a knee problem.         
	The Swedish doctors worked around the clock to get the striker ready and he was able to start alongside Henrik Larsson, the veteran making his 98th appearance for Sweden.         
	In the wonderful setting of the Tivoli Neu Stadium, with the sun setting behind the Alps, the atmosphere and colour was magnificent, the fans capturing the importance of the game in style. And it was Russia who threatened first when, in the seventh minute, Arshavin fed Diniyar Bilyaletdinov, whose forward pass fell invitingly for Igor Semshov, only for Konstantin Zyryanov to get in his way as he prepared to shoot.         
	While there was an urgency about the Russians, Ibrahimovic was next to force a chance, the power of his header insufficient to trouble Igor Akinfeev. Back came Russia, Aleksandr Anyukovs cross offering Arshavin a headed chance he planted wide.         
	Then, from the right, another Anyukov delivery was met by Arshavin and the striker, quickly imposing himself on the game, side-footed wide. Another right-footed attempt by the striker served as further warning to the Swedes.         
	They were now facing a constant barrage, wave after wave of red-shirted attacks, and in the 21st minute Arshavin attempted an audacious shot from an acute angle, forcing Swedens Manchester City goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson to arch back and tip over his goal.         
	Such was the pressure, it was no surprise when Russia took the lead, in the 24th minute. Zyryanov cut the ball in from the right, to Anyukov, who just helped it inside, from where Pavlyuchenko beat Isaksson with ease to claim his second goal of Euro 2008.         
	Sweden, though, responded shortly afterwards and were unfortunate not to level, with Larssons header, from Mikael Nilssons cross, dropping onto the crossbar.         
	Such was their swift movement and clever passing, Russia gave the impression of having twice as many men on the pitch and, in the 36th minute, Pavlyuchenko came close to scoring a second. Bilyaletdinov fed the striker and he rattled the crossbar. The ball rebounded to Zyranov, whose effort was brilliantly saved by Isaksson.         
	But, in the 51st minute, Swedish hope turned to fear when Russia scored their second and, quite possibly, one of the best worked, if not spectacular, goals of the tournament so far.         
	A Swedish free kick turned into a Russian counter-attack, producing half a dozen crisp passes from the halfway line to penalty area with Zhirkov seting up Arshavin, whose right-footed finish was sublime.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Austrians pull off last-minute equaliser
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Austrians pull off last-minute equaliser
                      
	Vienna: An injury-time penalty by Ivica Vastic earned co-hosts Austria a dramatic 1-1 draw with Poland at Euro 2008 on Thursday (as reported in Fridays Late City edition).         
	Vastic showed no sign of nerves as he sent goalkeeper Artur Boruc the wrong way after Sebastian Proedl had his shirt pulled by Mariusz Lewandowski in the 93rd minute.         
	The 38-year-old became the oldest man to score in the finals, surpassing the record held by Portugals Nene who was 34 when he netted against Romania in 1984.         
	Earlier, Brazilian-born striker Roger Guerreiro gave Poland a first-half lead. Guerreiro was clearly offside when he scored his first goal from a 30th-minute scramble.         
	The co-hosts paid the price for squandering a host of early opportunities. We had our chances in the first 20, 30 minutes, said Austria coach Josef Hickersberger. Whether their goal was offside or whether (our goal) was a penalty, I couldnt judge from my position.         
	Poland coach Leo Beenhakker said the late penalty was a bitter pill to swallow. It is impossible to accept but Im working on it.

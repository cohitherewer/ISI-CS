The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag set for the No. 2 post
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sehwag set for the No. 2 post
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Nagpur: The in-form Virender Sehwag is set to be the Team India vice-captain in the forthcoming ODIs against England. Eventually, hell be named Mahendra Singh Dhonis deputy in all forms.         
	For over a year, Yuvraj Singh had been the vice-captain in ODIs and Twenty20, but a well-placed source told The Telegraph that a change would be made.         
	Sehwag is in terrific form and is a regular in every format... So, it makes sense to have him as the No. 2... Thats the thinking at this point, the source said on Thursday night.         
	Yuvraj hasnt been figuring in the selectors scheme of things in Tests.         
	A one-time stand-in Test captain, Sehwag had (in Dhonis absence) been Anil Kumbles deputy during the July-August Test series in Sri Lanka. Earlier, hed been vice-captain under Rahul Dravid for quite some time till the disastrous ODI series in South Africa, in late 2006.         
	Usually, the No.2 isnt named for a home series, but thats not cast in stone. For the record, on Wednesday, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Co. didnt appoint anybody as Dhonis deputy for the ODIs against England.

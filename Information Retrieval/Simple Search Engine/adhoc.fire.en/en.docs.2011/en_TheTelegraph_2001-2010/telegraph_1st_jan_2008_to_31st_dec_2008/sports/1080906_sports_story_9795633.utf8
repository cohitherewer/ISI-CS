	New Delhi: Mahindra United on Friday decided to offer midfielder Steven Dias a pay hike but a final decision will only be taken after discussing the matter with the team coach Derrick Pereira.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, the club president Alan Durante said: Dias met me today and we had a discussion. We will give both Dias and (NP) Pradeep a higher salary this season.         
	I told him that I should talk to Derrick first before I take a decision.

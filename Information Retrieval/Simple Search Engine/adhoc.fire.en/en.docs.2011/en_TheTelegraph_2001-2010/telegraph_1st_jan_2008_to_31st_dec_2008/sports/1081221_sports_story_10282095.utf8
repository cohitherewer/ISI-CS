                                                                                                                                                                                                     Visa dismay for Aisam
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan tennis star Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi Saturday dropped plans to take part in the Chennai Open after he failed to get an Indian visa on time.         
	The Indian high commission didnt refuse me a visa but they told me they cant issue it before a month, a disappointed Aisam said.         
	Aisam, who was due to take part in the high profile tennis event from January 6, said the Indian high commission had told him they would have to follow normal procedure while processing his visa application.         
	Indian authorities have revised their policy of issuing visas to Pakistan nationals after the Mumbai terror attacks.         
	The high commission in Islamabad had recently announced that from now on it would require at least a month to process visas so that proper security checks could be carried out.         
	Prior to the thaw in relations brought about by the Mumbai massacre, high profile Pakistan nationals travelling to India were issued urgent visas.         
	Aisam said he was disappointed at not getting the visa as he had been looking forward to the Chennai Open.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must-win tie for Greece
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Must-win tie for Greece
                      
	Klagenfurt: Holders Greece and Russia are expected to ring the changes on Saturday in their bid to avoid a dreaded second defeat in a row in group D at Euro 2008.         
	Tactical changes are mooted for Greece, whose cautious approach failed to pay off in Tuesdays 0-2 loss to Sweden, while coach Guus Hiddink has called for a different mentality among his Russia side after a 1-4 drubbing by Spain.         
	Greece coach Otto Rehhagel is expected to scrap the tactic of a five-man defence and opt for a more attacking 4-3-3 lineup.         
	Fanis Gekas should start as his pace will trouble Russias defence but there is a question mark over whether Angelos Haristeas and Yannis Amanatidis will make the XI.         
	Rehhagel could opt for the experienced Nikos Liberopoulosto replace either of them.         
	He might also deploy attack-minded defender Christos Patsatzoglou to close the gap between the back four and a midfield.         
	Hiddink has said he is unlikely to make any big changes to the team, although he may be forced to if striker Roman Pavlyuchenko does not recover from a thigh problem.         
	His absence would be a blow to Russia, already without suspended forward Andrei Arshavin and injured striker Pavel Pogrebnyak.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Police foil attempt to blackmail Sutil
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Police foil attempt to blackmail Sutil
                      
	Istanbul: Force India Formula One driver Adrian Sutil said on Friday police had foiled an attempt to blackmail him after last months Spanish Grand Prix.         
	When I came back from Barcelona there was a guy who had the hard disk of my old computer because my father had thrown it away about two years ago, the German said at the Turkish Grand Prix.         
	Somebody took this hard disk out of the computer, recognised me and he wanted to have a little benefit out of it, added the 25-year-old.         
	He asked for some money. I was a little bit shocked at the beginning, it was a new situation but finally after four days they caught him and now we have to see what happens.         
	Sutil said there was nothing on the hard drive that would have embarrassed him if made public, other than all my personal details, everything.         
	All my contacts, my friends, my pictures. All my life was on there, added the German.         
	You can imagine how bad it is. It doesnt matter what is on there but its my personal things and thats it.         
	The incident was the last thing Sutil needed after colliding with compatriot Sebastian Vettels Toro Rosso on the first lap and retiring in Spain.         
	That was the third retirement in four races this season for a driver who scored Force India predecessors Spykers sole point last year.         
	Sometimes everything comes together, he said. I need some more luck at the moment.         
	Its hard, the first four races and no real race kilometres. Its very disappointing but you cant really change anything. You always have to attack and try something because if you dont try, you dont give everything.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blatters views lack cohesion
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blatters views lack cohesion
    - The slavery in soccer debate           Andrew Baker            Cristiano Ronaldo has shown himself to be an opportunist                                 
	In the 18th century, slaves were transported in ships so tightly packed that dehydration, dysentery and scurvy led to the death of one in three. Slaves who were thought to not be working hard enough suffered arbitrary punishment; in the worst cases  theft, disloyalty and the like  methods designed to give the maximum pain to the victim were used.         
	The gibbet for a slow and painful death by hanging; flogging to death; the use of the wheel; and hanging, drawing and quartering (where the person being hanged was cut while still alive).         
	Signal the obligatory comment from Herr Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president. Blatter has long been willing to pontificate on all things English, usually to interfere, or warn England that they risk censure for all manner of things. Strangely, he shows no similar regard for other countries; Spain, for example.         
	While worthy European champions, they were lucky to be in the finals following the racist behaviour of their fans towards black players only a few years previously. From Herr Blatter what did we hear on this? Platitudes, but no effective action; talk, talk, talk.         
	When questioned about Cristiano Ronaldos apparent desire to break his contract with Manchester United in order to join Real Madrid, Blatter said: The important thing is we should also protect the player. If the player wants to play somewhere else, then a solution should be found, because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable, then its not good for the player or the club.         
	Im always in favour of protecting the player and if the player, he wants to leave, let him leave. I think in football theres too much modern slavery in transferring players or buying players, and putting them somewhere. We are trying to intervene in such cases.         
	The reaction to the Bosman law is to make long-lasting contracts in order to keep the players and then if he wants to leave, then there is only one solution, he has to pay his contract.         
	Herr Blatter must either have a tenuous grasp of history, or be unforgivably insensitive to use the word slavery in relation to the allegedly unfair treatment of Ronaldo. The fact that Ronaldo has agreed with Blatters words shows what a preening, pampered Portuguese pillock he is. None of the modern-day definitions of slavery apply.         
	I know not whether he is literate, or stupid, but he employs professionals to advise him and cannot be said not to have understood the legal obligations he undertook when his advisers negotiated a lucrative five-year contract with United, presumably with his full knowledge and permission.         
	As a trained lawyer, Blatter obviously has no problem saying the first thing that comes to mind to support his case, even if it appears contrary to what he has said previously. He must think we are all thick and suffer from amnesia.         
	It was only in January this year that Blatter and Fifa reacted angrily to a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on the Andy Webster case.         
	Earlier, on April 4, 2007, the Fifa dispute resolution chamber found Webster guilty of having breached his employment contract without just cause, outside the protected period. Webster wanted to leave his club, Heart of Midlothian, to play for Wigan Athletic. As a consequence, Fifa ordered him to pay Hearts compensation of 625,000.         
	The CAS reduced the payment to 150,000, which was the value of the remaining period of the contract. Thus, there was no punitive element. On this Blatter said: The decision which CAS took on 30 January, 2008, is very damaging for football and a Pyrrhic victory for those players and their agents, who toy with the idea of rescinding contracts before they have been fulfilled.         
	CAS did not properly take into consideration the specificity of sport as required by article 17, paragraph 1 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players.         
	Because of this unfortunate decision, the principle of contractual stability, as agreed in 2001 with the European Commission as part of the new transfer regulations and which restored order to the transfer system, has been deemed less important than the short-term interests of the player involved.         
	Unilateral early termination of a contract between a player and a club without just cause by either party, even if committed after the protected period, still remains an unjustified breach of contract. So which is it Herr Blatter  which of these contradictory points of view do you maintain?         
	Come to think of it, if Ronaldo is being treated like a slave, perhaps Sir Alex Ferguson might like to avail himself of one of the punishments listed above. I wonder which of the cruel and unusual ones he would favour.         
	Meanwhile, Fifa and Herr Blatter remain completely ineffective in combating the issues that weekly bring football into disrepute. Players diving, feigning injury, trying to get others sent off.         
	On these where is the leadership of Blatter? Why is he not investigating the proper use of technology to assist referees in games? I could go on and on.         
	Finally, I havent even started to list the multifarious allegations of a more sinister nature that surround Herr Blatters presidency. These would take a whole supplement, suffice to say serious allegations remain and have not been conclusively refuted by Herr Blatter or Fifa.         
	Should such an important office be held by a person whose grasp of legal decisions appears woefully inept; a person who either does not understand, or does, but does not care, that the use of the word slavery is insulting to the memory of those who suffered, and those who continue to suffer because of that abhorrent system?           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

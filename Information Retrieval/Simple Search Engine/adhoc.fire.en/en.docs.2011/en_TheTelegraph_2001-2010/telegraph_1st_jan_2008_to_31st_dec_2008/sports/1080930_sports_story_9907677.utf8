The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kaushik episode has left a bitter taste 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Kaushik episode has left a bitter taste 
  - Inclusion of Dilip, Ignace among probables is welcome                      Stickwork    Gurbux Singh                    M.K. Kaushik    
	Unfortunately, as I write this, the uncertain times for Indian hockey continue. Although nearly six months have passed since the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) took over the reins of hockey, it hasnt been able to appoint the national coach for the senior team, and the controversy over the appointment of M.K. Kaushik, whether he will be coaching the mens or the womens team, has left a bad taste in the mouth.         
	The bad publicity, along with all the confusion, is only making matters worse.         
	But the ad hoc committees decision last week to look for a foreign coach, I maintain, is a step in the right direction. However, care has to be taken to see that we get a top-class coach.         
	IOA had sent four coaches to the Beijing Olympics. I dont know what reports they have submitted. I only hope that they have made corrective suggestions to the IOA.         
	After the unfortunate departure of Ric Charlesworth, I feel another embarrassment should have been avoided, and care been taken to select coaches for both mens and womens teams, especially as it is now clear that Kaushik has returned to the womens team. It was, after all, the womens team that initially had him released from the SAI and the government.         
	Another thing, which seems strange to me, is that who exactly is calling the shots in the ad hoc committee? Although it must be said that the committee, headed by Ajit Pal Singh, has done a good job in selecting the probables for the national team.         
	Many new faces are present in this list, with a few old faces.         
	The initial omissions, of Dilip and Ignace Tirkey, had come as a surprise, but the committees decision to include them finally shows that they are aiming for a mix of youth and experience in the side. A judicious blend of these two elements always stands a team in good stead.         
	Talking of hockey and the probables, I feel there is a problem when it comes to the deep defenders. There is very little quality in this department.         
	It is true that Dilip (Tirkey) isnt getting any younger, but only a few players on that list can marshal the defence as well as he can.         
	I have to admit I see some very good goalkeepers. The full backs, like I have said, leave a lot to be desired but Dilip Tirkeys presence will be a definite boost.         
	The midfield, too, is an area that needs attention. The forwards, including the likes of Tushar Khandekar and Prabhjot Singh, can get the job done, but need practice and training.         
	I would like to add that the fitness of the players who have been included now is of paramount importance and should not be compromised upon.         
	I would also like to mention two events connected with hockey that have taken place in the recent past the seminar hosted by Bengal Hockey Association president J.B. Roy at Amby Valley, and, immediately after that, the AGM called by K.P.S. Gill in New Delhi.         
	Most of the state officials and former Olympians were present for the former.         
	But talking about the latter, I feel it is much more important that the elections for the Indian Hockey Federation take place at the earliest. The 2010 World Cup and the Commonwealth Games will be held in India and a defunct federation is the last thing we need.         
	Of course, as per the wishes of the FIH, the sooner the Indian mens and womens (the IHF and the IWHF) federations merge, the better.         
	But it is going to be a difficult task as the modalities of a merger have still not been worked out.

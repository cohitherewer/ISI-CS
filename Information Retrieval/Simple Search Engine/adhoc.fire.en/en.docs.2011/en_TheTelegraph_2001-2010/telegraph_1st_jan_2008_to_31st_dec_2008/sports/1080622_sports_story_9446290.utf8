The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | English mirror Aussie stance

  - Hope Champions Trophy decision wont be ours to take, says a senior pro       SIMON BRIGGS                            
	Englands top cricketers are in regular touch with their Australian counterparts as fears grow that the ICC Champions Trophy, a two-week tournament scheduled for Pakistan in September, will be hit by a wave of player boycotts.         
	Messages have been bouncing back and forth between England and the Caribbean  where the Australians are about to start a one-day series against the West Indies  as players discuss their concerns over visiting a country where political violence is commonplace.         
	The Aussies have already come out and expressed their concerns, one senior England player said on Friday.         
	Im not a big fan of going to Pakistan. I just hope it wont be us players who get left to make the decision in the end.         
	Reg Dickason, a security expert who works for both Cricket Australia (CA) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), is going to Pakistan next week to see the arrangements for the Asia Cup  a six-team tournament also involving India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.         
	Dickason will report his findings to the English and Australian boards, raising the possibility of a united stance from the two countries, while New Zealand Cricket may also decide to consult him.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting, speaking in Barbados this week, admitted that there was some apprehension among some of the players.         
	It is less than two months since Australia postponed their Test tour of Pakistan because of security concerns and, as Ponting pointed out, the situation has not changed.         
	Pontings stance was backed by Daniel Vettori, New Zealands captain, who suggested that the Champions Trophy would be a hot topic among his players when Justin Vaughan, the chief executive of New Zealand Cricket, arrives in London next week.         
	If the Australians have got concerns, Im sure a lot of other teams will as well, Vettori added.         
	The International Cricket Council launched the Champions Trophy this week with a lavish ceremony in Lahore. Ray Mali, the outgoing ICC president, went so far as to describe Pakistan as a great host to a great tournament. Yet this latest controversy will only confirm how accident-prone the ICC have become.         
	Not only is the Champions Trophy due to start on September 11  an unfortunate piece of scheduling  but the back-up venue is Sri Lanka, a nation with serious security problems of its own.         
	Vettori was among the New Zealand squad staying at the Pearl Continental Hotel in Karachi in 2002, when a suicide bomber drove his car into a bus carrying European naval engineers. The death toll was 14, and the windows of the hotel were blown inwards, causing minor injuries to one member of the management team.         
	But Vettori did hold out some hope for the troubled tournament. I went back to Pakistan the year after the bombing, he said, and the security then was intense and almost overwhelming. It did feel safe, and if they could promise that level of security it might appease a lot of guys.         
	The third game in the five-match NatWes Series takes place at Bristol on Saturday and the match officials will again be keeping a close eye on the weather forecast.         
	After the embarrassment caused by the rain interruptions at Edgbaston last week, the ICC have given permission for the 45-minute break between innings to be reduced to just 10 minutes in case of bad weather.

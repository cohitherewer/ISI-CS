                                                   A scam in junior cricket

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: A scam in junior cricket sent shock waves through the state fraternity. 
    
	It was Soumen Ghosh who smashed 301 off 126 balls, including 32 sixes and 19 fours, in a CAB junior (110-point) league match on Thursday, but Masrum Sarkar got credited for the feat. 
    
	Masrum was the one listed to play for Kachrapara CCC in their match against Shilpashree Dum Dum CCC. But some unscrupulous  and over-ambitious  official sneaked in Soumen in place of Masrum by changing his picture submitted with the team list. 
    
	The umpires  Goutam Roy and Dhiman Ghosh  should have tallied the picture of each player submitted by the teams with that in the official CAB record, but obviously missed the player-swapping act. 
    
	Its the umpires duty to check the details given by the teams with that of the CAB record They failed to notice the change and cleared both teams, said CAB joint secretary Amitava Banerjee, who is in charge of junior cricket. 
    
	The CAB has a lesson to learn as well, as the other joint secretary Samar Pal conceded. The pictures in the official file will have to be stamped from next year, he said. They werent this time, which helped the Kachrapara team cheat. 
    
	A complaint has been lodged by the Shilpashree Dum Dum CCC, based on which the CAB announced a hearing on January 29 when all the players, officials and umpires have been summoned. 
    
	Theres a possibility that action could be taken against the umpires and the erring officials. For the record, Shilpashree Dum Dum CCC were bundled out for 121 in reply to Kachrapara CCCs 634. 
    
	The result, however, will be pending till the hearing is completed, according to Banerjee.

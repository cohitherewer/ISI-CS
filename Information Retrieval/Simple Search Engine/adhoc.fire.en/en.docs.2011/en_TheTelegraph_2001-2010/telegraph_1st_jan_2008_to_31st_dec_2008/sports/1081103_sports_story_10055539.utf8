  - Brazilian GP Massas win at home not enough to erase seven-point deficit       Kevin Garside              Models pose before the start of the Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix at the Interlagos race track in Sao Paulo   on Sunday. (REUTERS)                                        
	Sao Paulo: Hamilton starts from fourth. Ferrari have gone for broke. Pole is the place to be when victory is the goal. Prepare to see Massa disappear on low fuel, Hamilton to tuck in behind and stay out of trouble. Taking the edge off the day is Hamiltons game. A hero in accountants clothing; nice and steady wins the day. This requires him to suppress the instincts that have brought him to this point. He gets the theory. Fifth will be enough, whatever Massa does. Yeah. Last year we came here and there was so much commotion  so much going on I thought it had to happen here, do or die, this is the last race.         
	Nerves were there, but I dont feel that this year. I feel good. In the last race I think I drove as well as Ive driven for a while and I feel confident I can do that again. The kind of performance, perhaps, to make Massa and Co take notice? Well, if they didnt, they should have done. It was a great achievement. There was all that stuff going on in the background, but I dealt with it. It was easy as pie. Im sure youll use that quote.         
	Afraid so. Impression management, the peacock strut, landing punches, up yours mate. This is the mental mortar that binds campaigns. Hamilton took some hefty stick in Shanghai, personal stuff. The boys were ganging up in the paddock playground. A response was required. Hamilton delivered it between the eyes. Ave it, to borrow from the lexicon of Peter Kay.         
	I didnt read any of the stories that were out. Everyone else knew what was being said. I was kind of aware of it but just laughed it off. I didnt go and say, Im going to make a point this race. I just went out to do the best job I could. If I beat the others, good for me.         
	Word has it that McLaren have brought 30 extra staff to Brazil to cover every eventuality. Lets hope that in their urgency to get everything right, McLarens cooks do not spoil the championship broth. Hamilton has been on the money thus far. He has shown nil appetite for talking up the moment. Romance is another country. I dont look at destiny or anything like that. I could race for years without winning the championship, but as long as I work hard then its possible.         
	I never assume anything. You cant start the season without trying to win the world championship. I entered the season hoping we would have a chance, and fortunately we are still here with the same chance.         
	Interlagos will be rocking, whistles and drums taking doors off hinges from dawn. Football invades Formula One. There is no place like this on the Grand Prix calendar.         
	We are all on edge here. No one is talking about anything but the championship. Back and forth the discussion goes. Hamilton wins it like this, Massa like that. You cannot move for paddock sages dispensing wisdom. Sidestepping the slew of advice is an art in itself for Hamilton and Massa, for whom thinking about the championship is not conducive to winning it.         
	The talking stops on Sunday. The result will serve up Formula Ones 30th champion. For many, Massa is too modest a talent to make hearts beat, despite his emphatic lap Saturday which made him the first to claim three successive poles in Brazil. The stands shook. The crowd convulsed.         
	McLaren are playing the long game, a tactic that surprised strategic gurus of the calibre of Ross Brawn and Mike Gascoyne, who both advocated a low fuel attack from pole for Hamilton.         
	Jarno Trulli, the random traveller starting alongside Massa, complicates matters for all. Ferrari had clearly planned to shut out the front row. Hamilton now has Kimi Raikkonen for company. The numbers suggest a two-stop strategy for Hamilton, three for Massa. History tells us that when the water falls, Massa goes under. Rain is no impediment to Hamilton. If the cars cross the line in the same positions they start, Hamilton is king. Not the worst thought in the world to take to the grid.         
	Hamilton is F1s great opportunity, a face to put an era to, its history man. There is no downside to a youngest world champion spreading an ethnic charter. Hamilton is the F1 word in a way Massa can never be. There are people out there who wont be reading this but who might want to buy a newspaper Monday to board the Hamilton train. Lets hope its steamin and a rollin.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

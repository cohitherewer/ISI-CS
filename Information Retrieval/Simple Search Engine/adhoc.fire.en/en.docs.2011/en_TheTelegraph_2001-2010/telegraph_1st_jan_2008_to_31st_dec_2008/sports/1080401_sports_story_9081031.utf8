The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Force India aim for a double finish 
                                                     Force India aim for a double finish 
                  Giancarlo Fisichella                     
	New Delhi: A buoyant Force India, confident that they have managed to iron out the problems in Adrian Sutils car, will head for the Bahrain Grand Prix eyeing a double finish.         
	The side has shed its back-markers tag with Giancarlo Fisichella impressing in practice sessions and finishing 12th in the Malaysian Grand Prix. Sutil, though, has not made his mark yet, retiring both in Melbourne and Sepang when gremlins crept into his car.         
	Team principal Colin Kolles, however, believes the side can look forward to a double finish in Bahrain on April 6.         
	Our aims for this race have to be to get into second qualifying sessions and achieve a double finish, Kolles said.         
	This is, I believe, a realistic goal as we have new aero parts for this race that should give another improvement and I am confident we have addressed the reliability issues in Adrians car, he added.         
	Chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne also expected a snag-free outing on Sunday.         
	We have analysed the reasons for Giancarlos poor start in Malaysia, which was due to a clutch problem. Hopefully this shouldnt happen again. We are also analysing the reason for Adrians retirement and are confident we will not have a recurrence of the same problem, Gascoyne said.         
	Besides, the cars will have several new aerodynamic parts on the front wing and new brake ducts, which should result in a better performance, he said.         
	Sutil was also confident of finishing the race.                   Adrian Sutil      
	I just need to have the opportunity to finish to show what we can really do. We saw in Melbourne that my first lap was very good and the car is more competitive than last year, for sure. Im looking forward to racing again and getting my first finish of the year, he said.         
	For Fisichella, the target is the same as it was in Malaysia. I want to complete the full distance and improve the race pace if we can, although in Sepang our lap times were already pretty competitive.         
	Chairman and managing director Vijay Mallya echoed their optimism and asserted that Force India were not on the grid just to make up numbers. We have done the math, we have looked at the statistics and have improved by over two seconds from this time last year. This is not a sign of a team just pleased to be here, he said.

	Perth: Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna maintained their unbeaten run to tame Australias Alicia Molik and Peter Luczak in the mixed doubles encounter and pull off their first win in group A of the Hopman Cup on Tuesday. 
    
	After being tied 1-1, the Indian duo fought tooth and nail in the decider to win it 2-6, 6-4, 6-7 (11-13) after a tussle lasting 77 minutes. 
    
	With this victory, the Indian pair, which lost its opening tie to the United States, kept itself afloat in the tournament. 
    
	Earlier, Sania overcame a stiff challenge from Molik and won the womens singles clash 2-6, 6-2, 4-6 to give India a 1-0 lead. 
    
	However, Bopanna lost the mens singles match to Luczak 7-6, 6-3 and allowed the sixth-seeded hosts to level the contest. 
    
	Sania, who had almost lost the final set after being 5-1 up, acknowledged that it was never easy against a tough opponent like Molik. 
    
	I almost lost that one. 15-40, 0-40, it does not matter, she can come up with a big serve at any time, she said. 
    
	India now have one win and one loss record. The top team in each group advances to Fridays final. In their next group engagement, the seventh-seeded India will face third seed Czech Republic. 
    
	The United States head group B with two wins out of two but both India and Australia can still qualify for Fridays final. We are really happy that we are back in the running, Sania said. 
    
	I think we played really well, especially Rohan in the first set and a half, he was all over the place. I think they were a bit surprised by him.

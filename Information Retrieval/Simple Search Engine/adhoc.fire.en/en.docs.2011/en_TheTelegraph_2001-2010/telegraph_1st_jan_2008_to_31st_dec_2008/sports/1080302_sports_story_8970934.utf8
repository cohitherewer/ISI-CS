	Chittagong: South Africa tightened the noose around Bangladesh after posting a huge first innings score on a record-shattering second day of the second Test on Saturday.         
	After declaring their first innings on 583 for seven, the visitors reduced the home team to 60 for three at close.         
	Shahriar Nafees was batting on seven with Abdur Razzaq on eight at stumps.         
	Dale Steyn polished off the cream of the Bangladeshi batting with figures of three for 24 off eight overs to complement the effort of double centurions Graeme Smith (232) and Neil McKenzie (226).         
	The duo created history in the third over of the day when they broke the world record of 413 runs for the best opening stand, which Indias Pankaj Roy and Vinoo Mankad created against New Zealand in Madras in 1956.         
	It was also only the second time that both openers had made double centuries in an innings. Australias Bill Lawry (210) and Bobby Simpson (201) did so against the West Indies in Bridgetown in 1964-65.         
	Steyn first claimed Tamim Iqbal when he was caught in the slips for 14. Junaid Siddique (18) then became Steyns 100th victim in only his 20th Test when he was caught behind by Mark Boucher. Steyn and Boucher also sent back captain Mohammed Ashraful for a first-ball duck.         
	With these two catches, Boucher overtook Adam Gilchrist and took his tally Test wicketkeeping catches to 401.         
	Mohammed Rafique took also completed 100 Test dismissals but in his final match.           (AGENCIES)

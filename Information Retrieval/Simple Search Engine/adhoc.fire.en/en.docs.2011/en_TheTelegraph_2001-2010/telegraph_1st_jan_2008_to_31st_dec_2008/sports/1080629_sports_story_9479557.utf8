The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians cash in on Bangla slip-ups
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Indians cash in on Bangla slip-ups

	Karachi: Team India took a firm step towards making next Sundays Asia Cup final but Bangladesh had their moments at the National Stadium on Saturday evening.         
	The first Super Four match could, indeed, have gone the lower-ranked teams way had catches not been grassed in successive Mashrafe Mortaza overs.         
	Bottomline, however, is that India won by seven wickets (and with a handful of overs to spare). The in-form Suresh Raina, who has authored a remarkable comeback, collected his third MoM award in as many matches.         
	Raina remained unbeaten on 116, taking his tournament tally to 301.         
	The dropped catches, though, were talked about more.         
	Farhad Reza let go Gautam Gambhir on 56 (97 for two) and Mahmudullah dropped Raina on 16 (104 for two). The same fielder let go Raina on 101 too. By then it was all over.         
	Gambhir, who has been consistent with a capital C this year, also made the most, getting 90.         
	On match-eve, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had told The Telegraph that Bangladesh wouldnt be taken lightly, but resting three regulars  Virender Sehwag, Piyush Chawla and Praveen Kumar  did suggest otherwise.         
	Weve played three matches in four days and the players are tired The intensity wasnt there from the start, but thats going to happen if the scheduling is such, Dhoni pointed out.         
	The captain went a step further and said he wasnt happy with the fixtures, with two teams having back-to-back matches (Sri Lanka being the other) and two others not having back-to-back matches.         
	The scheduling has actually been lopsided and the Board shouldve taken it up with the Asian Cricket Council.         
	Bangladesh, in fact, did very well to post 283 for six (best versus India). At one stage, it had even seemed theyd get 300-plus.         
	The gifted Tamim Iqbal (one of the heroes of the stunning win over India in the last World Cup) got 55 at the top of the order. Then, Alok Kapali produced a career-best 115 and featured in a rousing 112-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Mahmudullah.         
	Kapali, to put it simply, was superb with his shot-making.         
	Rudra Pratap Singh and Manpreet Singh Gony, in particular, were taken to the cleaners. Debutant Pragyan Ojha, however, was more than decent with the ball. Additionally, he was tidy on the field.         
	He exploited the conditions well and bowled at the right pace Overall, he was quite good, is how Dhoni lauded the 21-year-old left-arm spinner.         
	Again, Indias catching left much to be desired.         
	Dhoni, though, laughed it off. I think it has something to do with the stadium A lot of catches are being put down, not only by my team         
	With good reason, there was much praise for Raina. Hes returned as a confident batsman Hes playing straight, in the V He started off at No.6 or 7 and those are difficult positions On a good day, you could be 30 not out and on a bad day, get out for 10 Now, hes up the order         
	Raina, incidentally, is one short of equalling Sourav Gangulys world record of four MoM awards in succession  the former captain got them during the memorable 1997 Sahara Cup in Toronto.         
	Footnote: Dhoni maybe tired, but his sense of humour is in place. Asked if the pathetic turnout disappointed him, the captain quipped: The policemen, at least, got to see the match in peace Unke liye to aaraam tha!

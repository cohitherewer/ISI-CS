                                                   Not happy with putting: SSP
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Gurgaon: After a sensational performance in the Indian Masters, Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia disappointed fans for the second time in as many weeks when he missed the cut in the ongoing Johnnie Walker Classic.         
	The Calcutta golfer had earlier bowed out of the SAIL Open at Noida last week.         
	While another Indian, Shiv Kapur had an amazing run in his front nine, Chowrasia had one-over 73 on Day II. The cut was set at two-under 143 after lot of good scores. Since Chowrasias total score was one-over 145, he had to be left out.         
	It certainly wasnt any great performance, Chowrasia said later. I could have done much better than one-over.         
	The Indian Masters champion said he had problems with putting. I wasnt satisfied with my putting. I dont know why... I could have fired a few more birdies but I missed. It is disappointing to be out but I have to put more stress on my putting.         
	Arjun Atwal was also far from his best. Atwal birdied his second hole but threw the point away in the very next hole. He finished at even-par 72 to remain at three-under 141 after two days.         
	Atwal, who is looking to come back after a slump, said he could have done better.         
	I have struggled with my game in the past year and a half Ive basically come back to the golf courses and to the tournaments that Ive played well before, he said.         
	I was struggling with my game and had a disc out in my lower back, he said. By the time I got that right in March 2007, I had the car accident.         
	Rahil Gangjee, who was tied third with four-under 68 on Thursday, finished the day with one-under 71. He now has a respectable score of five-under.         
	Rahil had a dream run in front nine with a bogey free four-under to be at third in the leader-board with eight-under in the beginning. Rahil then had a poor 9th hole to reduce his score to six-under with a rare double bogey, his first bogey of the day.

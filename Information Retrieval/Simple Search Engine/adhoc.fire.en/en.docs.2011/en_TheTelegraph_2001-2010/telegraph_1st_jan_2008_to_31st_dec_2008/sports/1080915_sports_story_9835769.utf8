	Yes, I am disappointed with Lewis. Usain did better than all the other athletes before him and yet he (Lewis) does not manage to believe in him, said Powell.         
	What Usain did does not shock me, because I know how much talent he has and this is the first year he has devoted his training to the 100m, Powell said. (AFP)

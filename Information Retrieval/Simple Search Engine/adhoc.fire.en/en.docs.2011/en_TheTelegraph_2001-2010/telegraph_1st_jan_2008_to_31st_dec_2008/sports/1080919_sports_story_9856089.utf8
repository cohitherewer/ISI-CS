	Tokyo: Beijing Olympic gold medallist Elena Dementieva earned a berth in the lucrative season-ending championships Thursday as Jelena Jankovic took another step towards becoming world No. 1.         
	Dementieva, the third seed who won the Pan Pacific Open here in 2006, overwhelmed Alize Cornet 6-0, 6-3 to book a place in the quarter finals.         
	The Russian took the first 10 games in a row for a runaway victory in just 69 minutes. With the win, she joined Jankovic, Serena Williams, Dinara Safina and Ana Ivanovic in qualifying for the elite $4.45 million Sony Ericsson Championships in Doha, Qatar from November 4-9.         
	Previously, Jankovic held the world No. 1 ranking for just one week. She could get it back this week though and took a step in the right direction by crushing Flavia Pennetta of Italy 6-2, 6-1.         
	In other matches, Agnieszka Radwanska defeated Marion Bartoli 6-2, 6-3, while Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Ayumi Morita 6-1, 6-1. (PTI)

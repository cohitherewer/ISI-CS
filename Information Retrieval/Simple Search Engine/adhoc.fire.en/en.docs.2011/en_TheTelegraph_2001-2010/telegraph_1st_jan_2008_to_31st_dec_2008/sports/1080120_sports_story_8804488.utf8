                                                   Venus tames brave Sania 

           
	Melbourne: Sania Mirza tested eighth-seeded American Venus Williams at the Australian Open on Saturday before bowing out after a one-and-a-half-hour battle. Sania produced a superb performance but Venus eventually wore her down 7-6, 6-4 to reach the last 16 and will next meet Li Na of China or Polish qualifier Marta Domachowska. 
    
	The gutsy Indian, seeded No. 31, matched Venus shot for shot. She broke first and even served for the first set at 5-3, only for Venus break back. The Indian star fended off two set points while serving at 5-6 to force a tie-breaker where Venus was at her best, winning it 7-0. 
    
	Venus had five aces in the second set when she dropped only seven points in five service games. She broke Sania to pull ahead at 4-3, then held serve the rest of the way. The 21-year-old Sania was mainly undone by 28 unforced errors and she had as many as 16 unforced errors in the second set. 
    
	Sania later left reporters in no doubt as to how she was feeling. Im a little disappointed and tomorrow morning Im going to wake up and feel even more like crap about it, she said. 
    
	I felt like I had the first set and should have closed it out at 5-4. But I take a lot of positives out of it. Shes supposed to be one of the biggest hitters of the game, and I was out-hitting her. Thats a very good thing for me. 
    
	Sania had matched the American from the baseline but the former world No.1 had the distinct edge in the serve department. I think we always knew shes one of the best servers in the game and Im really not, Sania said. Im very critical about my game. I think Im one of the worst servers in the game, if you want me to put it very, you know, matter-of-factly. Still, I think I was able to hold my own. I was able to hold my serve. Yes, of course she came up with the aces when she needed (them) and I couldnt. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Williams confident of F1 survival
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Williams confident of F1 survival

	Williams claimed on Monday they were among the best equipped of the teams to handle the current economic crisis.         
	After a weekend in which they were conspicuous by their silence, Williams launched a robust defence of their Formula One credentials. With their sponsors, RBS and Baugur, badly hit by the economic slowdown, speculation has been rife that the team founded by Sir Frank Williams and Patrick Head in 1977 could follow Honda out of a sport still in a state of shock following the Japanese car manufacturers withdrawal last Friday.         
	But although Williams chief executive Adam Parr claimed it was probable that another team would follow Hondas lead, he stressed that it was unlikely to be his.         
	Were among the best equipped to handle the economic crisis, Parr said. Frank epitomises the British spirit and Patrick [Head, engineering director] is a true bulldog.         
	I had expected one or two teams to pull out of Formula One imminently. And I also said that it was not necessarily going to be just independent teams that were involved.         
	I believe that we probably will lose another team before the beginning of next season and there is a very high chance it will be a manufacturer.         
	Whats been remarkable to me is that the last few days at Williams have been the same as they were last year, and the year before that, and the year before that. We always fight to be in Formula One. We have to go out and raise every cent that we need to put together a decent budget and go racing. So this is nothing new for us.         
	Parr may sound confident, but there is no denying that the teams accounts are wince-inducing. RBS and Baugur provided Williams with an estimated $50million (34.3million) of their $160.6million (110.3million) budget in 2008 and are highly unlikely to continue investing at that sort of level. The team made back-to-back after-tax losses of 21.4million and 27.7million in 2006 and 2007 and had only 13,000 cash left in the bank at the end of 2007.         
	Net debt has trebled to 25million after a loan from Barclays, but Williams do still have access to 33.8million of borrowing facilities.         
	Williams would benefit more than most from FIA president Max Mosleys standardised engine proposals.         
	They currently buy their engines from Toyota at an annual cost of 13.7million. Williams also have a good relationship with the proposed standard engine manufacturer, Cosworth, having run their engines in 2006.         
	Either way, Parr stressed that the team would roll with the punches because that was their only option.         
	We believe that our position is pretty much different to all the other teams because every other team in Formula One is primarily dependent on one of its shareholders that is providing either all or a very high proportion of the income for the team, he said.         
	That shareholder is in Formula One primarily for marketing reasons. They can at any time decide that the cost-benefit ratio of leaving Formula One makes sense.         
	The difference with Williams is that we dont have a choice about being in F1; that is what we do.         
	Red Bull Racing have also followed the lead of BMW Sauber, Ferrari, McLaren-Mercedes, Renault and Toyota in pledging to remain in the sport.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

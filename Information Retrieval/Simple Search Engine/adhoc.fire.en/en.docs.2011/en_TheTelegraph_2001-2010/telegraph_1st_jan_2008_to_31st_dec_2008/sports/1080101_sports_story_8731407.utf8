                                                   Odafes four in Churchill victory

           
	Margao: Man of the match Odafe Onyeka Okolie capitalised on the sloppy Salgaocar defence to slam in four goals as Churchill Brothers came from behind to register a 5-1 win in their Round VIII encounter of the ONGC I-league at the Nehru Stadium on Monday. 
    
	Okolie struck in the 42nd, 80th, 85th and 86th minutes while Rowilson Rodrigues found the net in the 79th. Salgaocar had earlier taken the lead through Felix Chimaokwu (40th). 
    
	The win took Churchill to 16 points from eight matches, two behind tabletoppers JCT and Dempo. Salgaocar remained on three points. 
    
	Salgaocars poor form in the league forced them recall Brazilian medio Fabio dos Passos.

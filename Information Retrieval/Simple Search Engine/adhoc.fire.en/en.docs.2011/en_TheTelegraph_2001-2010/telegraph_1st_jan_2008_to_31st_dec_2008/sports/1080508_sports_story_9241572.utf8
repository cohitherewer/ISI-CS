The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I accept there are things I could have done differently: Shoaib
                                                                                                                                                                                                       I accept there are things I could have done differently: Shoaib
    - FLASHBACK 
  -  EXCERPTS FROM ONE-ON-ONES WITH THE TELEGRAPH             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shoaib Akhtar                                 
	The fear of offending either the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) or the head of its appellate tribunal, Justice (retd) Aftab Farrukh, is making Shoaib Akhtar stay away from the media.         
	Hes made only one request  that the media be kept away from him and vice-versa, is what a member of the Kolkata Knight Riders team management had to say.         
	However, as Shoaibs arrival has caused a stir in the city and beyond, The Telegraph is reproducing excerpts from two interviews with him.         
	The exclusive one-on-ones do reveal much about one of the biggest headline-makers cricket has seen in recent memory.         
	Of the two, interview No.1 was in Hobart in January 2000, during the tri-series, and the next in Glasgow in July 2007, on the eve of what shouldve been an Indo-Pak ODI in aid of a trust patronised by Prince Charles. Rain, though, played spoilsport.         
	The following are excerpts from the interview conducted on July 1, 2007:         
	Always making headlines         
	(Laughs) Thats because the media loves me As you can see, Ive lost some hair and my stubble is no longer all black The controversies have affected me Ive had to struggle to beat the odds Ive felt the strain, yes.         
	Having helped script the controversies         
	I dont want to be controversial Things have happened but Im not going to blame others. Believe me, every controversy has made me a better person A stronger character         
	Whether the two-year ban for testing positive, which eventually got lifted, also made him stronger         
	Yeah That (October-November 2006) was the worst period My own countrymen shunned me, with some even refusing to look at me It was a terrible period Everybodys body mechanism isnt the same and certain levels are higher in my body when compared to others My hormone level fluctuates I didnt take drugs to enhance my performance I dont need to I dont know why I was treated so badly The test, after all, didnt show that I was an evil person That I was bad for society Sadly, people dont try to understand me. Ive always been misunderstood Ive never seen myself bigger than the game.         
	Secret behind his mental toughness         
	God never gives more pain than what youre able to tolerate Whatever the controversy, after the initial disappointment and anguish, Ive always steeled myself and fought back The first step is hard, after that its easy As a kid, I would boast about becoming a star I didnt know how, but I never gave the impression of not knowing I stuck to my belief and the doors opened.         
	His debonair image         
	It has been created by the media Yes, Im not married and love partying and so on, but why should that be an issue if I perform on the field? Performance counts, not ones image. Main koi baccha nahin hoon but I accept there are things I could have done differently.         
	Whether he sees cricket as a 9.00am to 5.00pm job         
	Absolutely Just change the timings for the day-night games! I must be judged for what I do in that period. After that, well, I should have the freedom to do what I want. Im not immature to get into things which will affect my career.         
	The time when his action was deemed suspect         
	Yes Even that was a terrible period and it really hurt me The first time (1999-2000) was awful Im always going to be thankful to Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya, the International Cricket Council (ICC) president at that point in time, for his support But, as Ive said, every controversy has made me a better and a stronger person For a while, I may have felt gutted, but the controversies havent killed my josh and the desire to play for Pakistan.         
	Not having a great relationship with Inzamam-ul Haq         
	Ive never had a problem with anybody Others have had problems with me Some have this tendency to get jealous They get insecure Im not jealous about anybody or anything Look, Im most happy when (Mohammed) Asif does well Im happy when a Brett Lee or a Shane Bond turns in a fiery performance Ive never felt insecure Actually, whoever the captain, he has to understand the psyche of a fast bowler.         
	Having had fundamental differences with Bob Woolmer         
	It took me a year to understand Bob It probably took him quite a bit of time to understand me as well It took him time to realise that match-winners are rare and they need to be looked after We did have differences but I didnt misbehave However, I admit to a big argument with him in South Africa (earlier in 2007), when he suspected I was faking a hamstring injury. I exploded, for he had no business doubting my integrity and nationalism The next day, Bob apologised as hed been misinformed about my injury (After a pause) His death left me stunned Whats worse is that his body remained in Kingston for weeks and weeks Such indignity         
	On the difference a coach can make at the highest level         
	Very little The newcomers need a coach, thats it. Collectively, the team needs somebody to liaise with the board. Thats needed as there often are many changes (within the PCB).         
	Whether Shoaib Malik, the new captain, has his support         
	Of course He doesnt speak too much and Im confident hell do well Even the new vice-captain, Salman (Butt), has my support Didnt you see us go out to the City Centre? Im not jealous that X is the captain or Y is the vice-captain Im ambitious, but the ambitions centre around my trade Today, Im working towards bowling in excess of 100mph Obsession or not, Im going to achieve it.         
	Not liking batsmen         
	I dont When I come charging in, the one thought is to **** them I like being aggressive and dont like batsmen who keep improving their average by batting against mediocre attacks on flat wickets Its a pity that there are so few genuinely quick bowlers Batting has definitely become easy and ridiculous rules such as a free hit (in ODIs and Twenty20) after a foot-fault no ball are absurd For Gods sake, dont discourage fast bowlers. Nowadays, the big totals are thanks to a decline in the quality of bowling, not because of an improvement in batsmanship.         
	The newer fast bowlers in Pakistan not exactly being great         
	(Thats) Because they havent had somebody to idolise Theres no Imran Khan or Wasim Akram or Waqar Younis I keep getting pulled down Keep being made a scapegoat Im treated like somebody on whom all the filth can be dumped... Mere upar hi sab ata hai Unless the youngsters find somebody to idolise, be it a batsman or a bowler, cricket in Pakistan may die in five years. Some years ago, we would be mobbed at airports and traffic signals Now, thats not the case. Cricket isnt a craze and, among other things, the system needs to be looked at.         
	Faith having become an issue within the team         
	Nothing must be imposed Faith is a personal thing, its between an individual and Allah Weve got to be true Muslims, yes, but nothing should be thrust on somebody People dont have to be told what to do At the end of the day, Im wholly answerable to Allah, not somebody on earth. Really, the bottomline is that Ive got to be honest, which I am.         
	Whether hes more up for it when the Sachin Tendulkars are in the opposition         
	No The opposition doesnt matter Sachins a good batsman and a humble person At the same time, I havent forgotten he once called me a chucker I had to restrain myself (Virender) Sehwag said the same thing and, today, hes been chucked out of the team!               
	Now, excerpts from the interview conducted on January 20, 2000:         
	Being regarded the fastest on the circuit         
	More than being considered the fastest, that Ive been able to play international cricket is like a dream come true. At times, abhi bhi khwab jaisa lagta hai         
	Whether touching the 100mph mark is an obsession         
	I wouldnt say so Taqdeer ki baat hai Its like this, more than speed, Im concerned about my performance. At the same time, my performance depends on speed Speed has been an attraction I even drive fast Swim fast too.         
	The physical and mental effort         
	Physical effort to aap sab ko dikh jaata hai Adjusting in the mind and getting it to coordinate with the body is very important No two wickets are exactly the same. Equally, no two grounds will be absolutely similar. Fast bowling isnt simply a physical exercise.         
	Pressure being a factor         
	I look at it differently  that I have a responsibility Thats not pressure. In any case, pressure tab hota hai when you keep thinking about it. Like Ive said, I accept theres a responsibility. Thats it.         
	Whether hed expected the ICC (then headed by Dalmiya) to lift his ban         
	Absolutely. I never felt theres anything wrong with my action No umpire has called me         
	Adjusting to Tests and one-dayers         
	Personally, I quite prefer one-day cricket Perhaps, it has something to do with the pace The atmosphere, a guaranteed result Maaza aata hai.         
	On how he unwinds         
	Listening to Kishore Kumar and Kumar Sanu songs They help me relax Lots of sleep as well Im also quite fond of Hindi movies, especially the ones starring Aishwarya Rai (Added laughing) Could you convey to her that Im a fan of hers?         
	Finally, having emerged as crickets latest pin-up hero         
	Im certainly not a playboy Aap kya bol rahen hain? Im a simple person Neither a playboy nor controversial.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I dont think I couldve done anything more: Buchanan
                                                                                                                                                                                                       I dont think I couldve done anything more: Buchanan
  - Ill be leaving having learnt something about the Twenty20 game, says Knight Riders coach       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan                                 
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders coach, John Buchanan, spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday evening, some hours after returning from Mumbai. He leaves for home on Monday night.               
	The following are excerpts from the one-on-one         
	Thoughts almost a week after the end of the Knight Riders campaign in the IPL         
	Looking back is probably easier sometimes when one is totally removed from the scene One has had time to look back, though Some of the obvious things have come to mind That our top-order needed to click That weve got to have the right balance That if some of the players arent available for a period of time, then we need the right back-up Thats a top lesson weve learnt from this year We had to try many opening combinations once (Brendon) McCullum left and (Chris) Gayle got ruled out through injury         
	Whether, as coach, he couldve done something better         
	One can always get better, but I dont think I couldve done anything more which wouldve made a significant difference Nothing which wouldve made a major difference Not making the last-four gave us the time and opportunity to sit back and reflect I couldve left for home straightaway, but didnt.         
	The review, at owner Shah Rukh Khans behest, earlier this week in Mumbai         
	The thrust, really, was that therell be continuity Shah Rukh and (co-owner) Jay Mehta are in it for the long haul The aim is to establish long-term relationships, within the franchise and with the sponsors Im pleased to be part of the process The setting up of the Knight Riders Academy is pretty much at the top of the agenda Going forward, the review has made me more confident.         
	Buzz that Sourav Ganguly (leading scorer for the Knight Riders) may not keep the captaincy         
	At this moment, theres no yes and theres no no either to your question Like the other players, Sourav is also under review I dont know why this keeps coming up, but Sourav and I havent had problems Ill be meeting him before I leave and Ill have a chat about Twenty20 cricket and his role.         
	Whether hell be advising Sourav, who has again been overlooked for ODIs, to focus on Test cricket         
	Its not for me to advise him At the end of the day, the decision has to be taken by Sourav himself Im sure hell be speaking to the right people before making up his mind         
	The uncertainty over Shoaib Akhtar         
	A lot of things need to be clarified With so much to clear, generally, I wouldnt like to talk of individuals.         
	The possibility of a tie-up between the Knight Riders and Queensland Cricket (QC)         
	It hasnt been finalised, but Im looking at arrangements both with QC and the University of Queensland In fact, on the cards is a trip to Queensland by 13-14 players in September-October Besides the younger players contracted to the Knight Riders, Im looking at including some U-19s from outside Bengal and also those wholl be coming out of one-year contracts with the other franchises The ones who could turn out for the Knight Riders next year This process has begun, but will take time.         
	If theres a lesson to learn from the success of teams like the Rajasthan Royals         
	They had a few things going for them A settled opening pair, firepower in the first three or four positions Strike bowlers and at least one allrounder         
	Anything else to be learnt from the IPLs inaugural edition         
	That one good year in the IPL or one bad year in the IPL, individually or collectively, doesnt make for an IPL has-been or an IPL success story.         
	The failure of a power-packed team like the Deccan Chargers         
	The franchise owners definitely have something to learn, but its not for me to comment. On paper, the composition of the Deccan Chargers wasnt much different from that of the Rajasthan Royals or even the Kings XI Punjab... So, obviously, there have been other reasons for failure         
	If theres a perfect combination for Twenty20 cricket         
	Well, what has been seen is that if you have wickets in hand at the end, then almost anything can be achieved in the last three overs or so Of course, you do need specialist bowlers for making inroads Quick bowlers who can make use of the bounce Wrist-spinners too A quality allrounder is also needed.         
	Whether the Knight Riders have sought a clarification from the IPL regarding the trading of players next year         
	Were waiting to hear from the IPL Transfers, releases In looking ahead, we need to be clear about all that         
	His top three players in the IPL         
	Shane Watson (Rajasthan Royals): He hits the ball correctly, long and hard I dont think any bowler felt confident bowling to him He has, at times, steadied the ship and then accelrated Then, hes been very effective with the ball Hes been an impact-bowler.         
	Sohail Tanvir (Rajasthan Royals): Outstanding Has the ability to swing the ball at the top of the innings and at the end Has a good change of pace and can bowl yorkers For me, hes been a revelation.         
	Shaun Marsh (Kings XI Punjab): Consistent and made a difference Its nice that he finally got a hundred the other day (115, against the Rajasthan Royals) Hes a fine fielder too.         
	Finally, what could be his thoughts as he clears immigration on Monday night         
	(Smiles) Theyll certainly be pleasant I came here knowing I was getting into something completely different That there could be a complete lack of success or that I could be successful Ill be leaving having learnt something about the Twenty20 game, having learnt something about Calcutta Having learnt about the franchise Ill be coming back at regular intervals At this point, though, Im not sure whether itll be once a month or once every two months.

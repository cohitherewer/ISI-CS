The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand wins in rapid, stays in lead
                                                   Anand wins in rapid, stays in lead
                                Viswanathan Anand         
	Nice: World champion Viswanathan Anand defeated Shakhriayar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan to register his second straight rapid victory in Round II of the Amber Blindfold and Rapid chess tournament here.         
	Anand continued his superb run with black pieces in this event that has one blindfold and one rapid game in each round.         
	Anand and Levon Aronian of Armenia are on joint top spot. Magnus Carlsen of Norway, Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk are just behind the duo with 1.5 points each.         
	In the combined standings, Anand shares the lead with Aronian and Ivanchuk. All three have three points apiece. Topalov and Carlsen, with 2.5 points each, are not far behind.         
	In the blindfold category, Russias Alexander Morozevich, Ivanchuk and compatriot Sergey Karjakin share the lead with 1.5 points each. Anand is in fourth spot in this section with one point along with Mamedyarov, Aronian, Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, Topalov and Carlsen.         
	Anand didnt have any problem in handling Mamedyarovs unusual opening in the rapid game.         
	The Indian world No.2 won an advanced pawn in the centre. It was only after the 31st move, though, that Anand won a second pawn with marvellous tactical acumen. The rest was easy.         
	The Indian, however, struggled in the blindfold game against Mamedyarov after getting to a fine position in the opening. At one point Mamedyarov took over the initiative and it looked as if Anand was treading on thin ice. The game was eventually drawn after 46 moves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | TN keep Bengal on toes 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       TN keep Bengal on toes 
            JOSEPH HOOVER            Laxmi Ratan Shukla is batting on 43                           
	Bangalore: Tamil Nadu did well to claw their way back into the Ranji Trophy quarter final at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on an eventful Sunday.         
	After conceding a 39-run lead, they snapped up four Bengal wickets for a modest 134 to give themselves an outside chance of making it to the semi-finals.         
	Bengal are 173 runs ahead with six wickets in hand, and with 90 overs to be bowled on the last day, it is anybodys match.         
	If skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who is batting on a gutsy 43, and Ritam Kundu, who survived a chance on four, could play out time and extend the lead to around 300, then Bengal could earn the right to play Uttar Pradesh in the semis.         
	But if Tamil Nadu bowl out their opponents for a second innings score of under 200, they could entertain hopes of winning the coveted title, they had last won in 1987.         
	The teams shared the honours on Day III with Bengal calling the shots in the first session and Tamil Nadu reconstructing their innings in the second.         
	The post-tea session was evenly contested, with Bengal asserting themselves in the last hour of play.         
	Tamil Nadu began disastrously, losing R. Ashwin to a run out in the first over of the morning.         
	Turning in for a third run, he found himself stranded as Kundus return from long on was relayed on to the stumps by Dinda.         
	Though Suresh Kumar (75) and C. Ganapathy (24) batted with aplomb and kept their side in contention for a first innings lead, Tamil Nadu suddenly lost three wickets in a trice at 258, triggered via a dubious decision by umpire Sudhir Asnani.         
	The ball had certainly not taken the inside edge of Suresh Kumars bat en route to Rohan Banerjee at widish first slip, but the umpire deemed it had.         
	To Tamil Nadus chagrin, Ganapathy, stumped by Wriddhiman Saha off Kundu, and Suresh, who was done in by a direct hit by Ashok Dinda, followed Kumar to the pavilion.         
	At this stage (87-run lead), Bengal were cock-a-hoop. But Laxmipathi Balaji (47, 86 balls) and Palani Amarnath (1, 40 balls) sullied their impromptu celebrations, with a stubborn 48-run last wicket partnership, which lasted 78 minutes and consumed as many as 115 deliveries.         
	It took a miscued hit from Balaji to ease Bengal out of their agony, a phase when they seemed to be under more pressure than their opponents.         
	With their regular openers  Arindam Das and Rohan Banerjee  indisposed, Bengal had to make do with makeshift openers in Wriddiman Saha and Avik Chowdhury, who succumbed to a Ganapathy short ball without scoring. Saha (42) and Manoj Tiwary (43) batted with gay abandon, before Balaji produced a beauty to get rid of the former.         
	When Tiwary, who top edged an intended sweep off Ashwin to Suresh Kumar at short fine leg, and Dibyendu Chakrabarty (0) fell in quick succession, Bengal were in trouble at 95 for four  ahead by only 134 runs.         
	But Shukla, who struck some lusty blows off Ashwin, and Kundu stemmed the rot to keep Bengal afloat at close.

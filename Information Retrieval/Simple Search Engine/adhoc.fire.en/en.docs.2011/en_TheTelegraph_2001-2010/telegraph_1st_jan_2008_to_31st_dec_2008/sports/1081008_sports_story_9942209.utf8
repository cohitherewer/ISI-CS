  - Former team india captain speaks to the Telegraph
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  Sourav Ganguly before announcing his decision that he would retire at the end of the ensuing Test series, in Bangalore, on Tuesday. (AP)      
	Calcutta: Its tough to call it a day, more so when one has been a stellar performer for over a decade. Sourav Ganguly, though, sounded reasonably relaxed when The Telegraph got through to him (at the Grand Ashok in Bangalore) some 45 minutes after his stunning decision.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Q For somebody so emotional, you showed little emotion in making such a big announcement. Did the decision to retire at the end of the Australia series actually come easy?         
	A (After a pause) It did, in the sense that Id prepared myself... Its not something that I decided to do this (Tuesday) morning...         
	But why two days before the series?         
	I just wanted it off my back... I can understand the feelings of well-wishers, but I think Ive taken the right decision. At the right time too. (After a pause) I couldnt have carried on playing like this (always being under scrutiny)... I hope youll understand.         
	How did you feel when you left the media conference after going public with your decision?         
	Felt light.         
	When did you first think of quitting?         
	Last month, the day (September 8) I wasnt picked for the Irani Trophy... Leaving cricket was on my mind from that afternoon...         
	Your failure in Chennai (India A versus New Zealand A) played no part in your decision...         
	Oh, no... Even a hundred in a match which precedes a Test doesnt guarantee anything... Chennai had absolutely nothing to do with this decision.         
	When did you tell your family, particularly Dona?         
	Probably a week or so ago... Could be 10 days.         
	Where decisions go, this one has been huge...         
	Its big, yes, but as Ive told you, I took it at the right time.         
	By saying you wanted it off your back, youve indicated that the pressure of having to perform got to you. Do you agree?         
	The pressure bit is always there...         
	But didnt (Test captain) Anil Kumbles strong support last week make you feel comfortable?         
	It did... Im thankful to Anil... He spoke the truth (rubbishing talk of a deal).         
	People may still say a deal was struck between you and the Board...         
	They can say what they like... If I had to strike a deal, I would have done so before the Rest squad for the Irani Trophy was selected. Why after that?         
	What did Kumble tell you when you informed him of your decision?         
	He said it was my call.         
	You also spoke to chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth...         
	He too felt the call was mine.         
	So, is the pressure off now?         
	One kind of pressure is off and Ill now be able to concentrate on the first Test (beginning Thursday) and the rest of the series.         
	What are your plans for the evening?         
	Nothing, really Theres a team dinner (at the hotel itself), thats about it.         
	How do you look back on your career?         
	Happy with the achievements...         
	Regrets?         
	None.         
	Not even what happened during the Kiran More-Greg Chappell era, in 2005-06?         
	I dont wish to waste my time talking about More... As for Chappell, I have nothing to say.         
	How much thought have you given to life after cricket?         
	Today, I wouldnt like to think of anything except the series which isnt many hours away I wouldnt like the focus to get affected.         
	The last one: Given your contribution to Indian cricket, in different roles, are you satisfied with the treatment meted out by the Establishment and sections of the media?         
	(Pauses) Ill answer this once the series and my career is over. For now, Im not saying anything more.

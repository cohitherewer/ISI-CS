                                                                                                                                                                                                     Another Indian lifter tests positive
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indias chances in weightlifting in the Youth Commonwealth Games in Pune suffered a huge setback when top junior lifter Harpreet Singh tested positive for use of banned steroid, according to Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) sources.         
	The 85-kg lifter, who is now training at the Army Sports Institute (ASI) in Pune, has returned positive for steroid nandrolone in the samples collected by the SAI laboratory in the capital.         
	Harpreet, who was tipped to win the gold for India in the Pune Games, became the third lifter from the ASI to be caught on doping charges.         
	Previously two more ASI trained lifters  Damodaran and Edwin Raju  tested positive for using banned substances.         
	Harpreet is the third lifter in the last four months to be banned for doping after Kavita Devi and Paritosh Upadhyay.         
	Sources said Harpreet was training under Dev Dutt Sharma whom the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) announced as coach to accompany lone lifter Monika Devi at the Beijing Olympics after the selection trial in Bangalore on July 15.         
	Under the latest IWF dope policy, Harpreet will be handed an automatic provisional two-year ban though he has the right to ask for his B sample test.         
	 If the B sample also tests positive his two-year ban will be confirmed.

	Opposition move   at CAB  Calcutta: The opposition is trying to garner support from two-thirds of the 121 affiliated units before placing a memorandum to the CAB president ahead of the special general body meeting on Tuesday.   The memorandum will demand that 70 per cent of the Rs 10 crore grant from the BCCI be distributed among the affiliated units and the rest used for infrastructure development. The signature campaign is already on and the opposition is confident of getting support of two-thirds of the clubs.  ldquo;Bengal have been relegated from the Elite group in Ranji Trophy. The CAB hasn rsquo;t bothered to discuss the issue at any meeting while the IPL seems to be of utmost importance. The Eden will not be available for local cricket and the Rajdanga ground is also out of bounds. The CAB should look at acquiring more grounds for the sake of local cricket, rdquo; a club official said.  The SGM has been called to work out an acceptable formula for distribution of IPL tickets. Only 20 per cent of the tickets in each block will be made available to the association.    
	Viv sees merit   in IPL  Calcutta: West Indian great Vivian Richards has said the huge money associated with the Indian Premier League (IPL) would do a world of good to cricket. He felt there was nothing wrong in bringing a lot of money to the game as it would be beneficial for the players. ldquo;If it can be arranged I don rsquo;t think anything would be wrong with that. Others, establishment-wise, see these things sometimes as threatening but I think it must be discussed, rdquo; Richards was quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald.    Clarke priority   Melbourne: Michael Clarke has put time with his ill father ahead of a possible million-dollar pay packet from the new Indian Premier League. Clarke rsquo;s father, Les, has been battling cancer and the star batsman said it was one of the factors in his decision to opt out of the IPL, which made several of his Australian teammates very rich last week.
  ldquo;It brings you back to reality, rdquo; Clarke said of his father rsquo;s situation. ldquo;Cricket is a big part of my life but I know now that things can change quickly. It doesn rsquo;t matter who you are or what you do. Cancer doesn rsquo;t discriminate.     
	Glenn honoured  Melbourne: Retired Australian paceman Glenn McGrath felt honoured when his club Sutherland renamed its ground after him.  McGrath was a member of the Sutherland team after shifting to Sydney from Narromine and though he played only a few games for it because of his international commitments, the club has always been proud to be associated with the speedster. In order to honour him, the club on Saturday rechristened Caringbah Oval as Glenn McGrath Oval.     
	BCCI no to offer   Karachi: Pakistan cricket officials were on Sunday left disappointed by their Indian counterparts, who rejected the proposal to play a short one-day series in March. BCCI president Sharad Pawar personally called up his Pakistani counterpart Nasim Ashraf to convey that the series was not possible because of a tight schedule of the Indian team.

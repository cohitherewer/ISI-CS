The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Boycott, a fighter to the core
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Boycott, a fighter to the core
            Olga Craig            Geoffrey Boycott                           
	One doesnt expect to witness Geoffrey Boycott wince. To see him hold his head in his hands, his expression pained. Geoffrey Boycott? He of the withering one-liner? The waspish put-down? The brusque, abrasive Yorkshireman as renowned for his boorish nature and critical candour as his legendary prowess on cricket pitches worldwide. But he does, and he doesnt care to disguise it.         
	Cancer treatment tough? he asks, in the flat, slow accent that is instantly recognisable to a generation of cricket fans. Ill say its tough. Its horrific. Its the sort of treatment that reduces strong men to tears. And it did me. Many a time. I was so full of morphine I kept falling asleep. And then, when I woke, the relentless pain was still there. But in the end there are just two of you in that match: you and the bloody cancer.         
	I would count my treatments like I once counted my runs. I had to have 35 laser sessions. Just get to 18, Id will myself, then youll be on the home run. You have to be mentally strong to keep the crying and the depression at bay. And all the time, through all this pain and fog, there is this niggling question at the back of your mind. Will it work?         
	But you have to be positive. Never, ever give in.         
	Boycott is easily a legend in his lifetime. He first played for Yorkshire in 1962. Two years later came his first Test match for England, after which he became the first England cricketer to pass 8,000 runs. In an 18-year career he played in 108 Test matches, scored 22 Test centuries and ended with a Test average of 47.73. On Thursday his book The Best XI, in which he picks the best Test teams of all time, comes out.         
	He first picked up a cricket bat at the age of nine when his uncle Algy, a county bowler, powered balls at him between matches. When he wasnt nipping over to the chestnut tree for a quick puff of a fag by the boundary line, Boycott recalls, with a big, gruff belly laugh. He finally put down his cricket bat for good 26 years ago. Twelfth of September 1986, 5.21 pm, he reels off. He hasnt wanted to pick one up since, he says, because you dont play second best.         
	In between the picking up and the putting down  and since  Boycott has led, lets say, a colourful life. With his bluff, no-nonsense image, few among his legions of fans knew anything of his private life. It was the brilliant batsman they revered. But in the background, Boycott was far from the puritan the public assumed.         
	He had never been one for monogamy. He juggled several long-term relationships, but whenever one dared whisper the word commitment, Boycott legged it. I never deceived, he says. Never. If there were misunderstandings then they werent listening.         
	Even when one (Rachel, now his wife) became pregnant with daughter Emma, Boycott had no intention of settling. He famously said of marrying: I would rather drop dead.         
	Today Boycott, who married Rachel five years ago, drops the words my wife into the conversation as though they were Darby and Joan.         
	Whoa, I say. What made you change your mind? I dont know. Bloody hell, how would I know that? he blusters. But hes laughing. Boycott has mellowed, but not with age. Rather with the experience of learning how transitory life is. I used to think cricket was everything, he admits. But staying alive is everything. Surviving cancer changes your perspective on everything. You get a second chance and you dont waste it. I could never, ever have gone through that treatment without Rachel. I couldnt have handled it by myself.         
	I was covered in raw, red burns from my neck to my chest, had to wear burn pads 24 hours a day. I had to be fed by tube for more than four months. I lost 50lb. I needed help with everything. You cant do it alone.         
	It was a difficult lesson for the fiercely independent Boycott. For a man who likes to take control, being divested of it was difficult. Not knowing if you would die  its not like batting, when you run things. I needed Rachel. And I had time to think of things I should have done and didnt. If you dont have regrets then you havent learnt anything from life. It smoothed a lot of my edges.         
	Throughout his life, Boycotts personality has been subjected to cod psychology. Many have conjectured that his love for his mother Jane, who died from cancer in 1978 and with whom he lived until he was 38, contributed to his need for self-sufficiency, to his loner life style. He has never spoken of her before.         
	She had a lump under her arm for ages before she told anybody, he says. Her generation didnt want to go bothering doctors. She only told me after I had made my 100th century at Headingley in the 1977 Test match.         
	She didnt want it to get in the way of that. Hell, I knew you had to get it quick. But it was too late for my mam. Two operations and a year later she was dead.         
	By now the sun is beginning to set and Boycott wants to know when we will talk of his book. Otherwise how will it sell? he asks with his characteristic bluntness. He wrote it because the game of who was the all-time best is one we love to play. He hopes it will engender debate. And if readers disagree? Dont give a toss, its my bloody book, he says, laughing loudly.         
	If someone writes a follow-up in 100 years, will he be in the first 11 of all-time greats? No bloody way, he laughs. Plenty better than me. I wish I was, but I wasnt. Christ, if I had thought I was that good I would have put me in the book.

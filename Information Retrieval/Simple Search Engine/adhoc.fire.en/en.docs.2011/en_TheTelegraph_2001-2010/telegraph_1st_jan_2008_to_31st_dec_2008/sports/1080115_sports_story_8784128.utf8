      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Perth: Its not official, but The Telegraphs sources have indicated that the Indians have called for an end to taking the fielders word for (low) disputed catches. 
    
	Obviously, Anil Kumble and Co. havent recovered from the SCG shock. 
    
	As the pre-series agreement was reached in Match Referee Mike Procters presence, in Melbourne, any announcement will come from him. 
    
	The third Test begins here on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev leaps to tied 7th 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Jeev leaps to tied 7th 
                      
	Ash (England): Jeev Milkha Singh put himself in contention for a top-five finish in the European Open, carding a three-under 69 in the penultimate round to leap to the tied seventh spot in the $4.79 million event.         
	With a three-round total of seven-under 209, the seasoned Indian pro is nine strokes adrift of leader Englishman Ross Fisher, who also turned in a 69.         
	Jeev made the best start of his campaign so far, reeling off a hattrick of birdies from third to fifth hole. But a dropped stroke on the sixth saw him make the turn two-under.         
	On his way back, Jeev picked up birdies on the 10th and 15th against a lone bogey on the 16th to round off a reasonably good day.         
	At the top, Fisher, leading the pack from the start, enjoys a three-stroke cushion going into the final round. Irishman Graeme McDowell (71) continues to be second with 203.

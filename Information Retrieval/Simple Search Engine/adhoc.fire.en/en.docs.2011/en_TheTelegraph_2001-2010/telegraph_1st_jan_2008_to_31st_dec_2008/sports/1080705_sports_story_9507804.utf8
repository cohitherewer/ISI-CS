        Mentor Viv impressed with Symonds  Melbourne: West Indies great Sir Vivian Richards feels flattered that new generation players such as Andrew Symonds look at him as a source of inspiration. The former West Indies captain believes he could still be a mentor to them. ldquo;He rsquo;s (Symonds) definitely one of the players I enjoy watching. I was chuffed when he came and said lsquo;thank you so much for the inspiration rsquo; and said lsquo;you were one of my heroes rsquo;, rdquo; Richards was quoted as saying by a local daily. ldquo;What more can you say when someone in the present game still believes that someone in the past can still be a mentor, because there rsquo;s a lot of folks who think that what went by, is dead, rdquo; he added.  Ricky to return   Calcutta: Cricket Australia (CA) on Friday advised that Australia captain Ricky Ponting will return home from the West Indies on Friday.

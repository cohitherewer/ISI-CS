                                                                                                                                                                                                       We will bounce back: Gambhir
                  Gautam Gambhir                     
	Galle: Still smarting from the humiliating loss against Sri Lanka in Colombo, Team India opener Gautam Gambhir on Monday asserted that the visitors will find a way to tackle the menacing spin duo of Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis in the second Test starting on Thursday.         
	We had a bad match but we are very positive now. We want to come hard at the Sri Lankans. They have a quality spin attack Muralidharan is a legend. It will be a fantastic battle because we have guys who can play good spin, Gambhir said.         
	The Indians lost the match in less than four days but Gambhir insisted that they were not unplayable.

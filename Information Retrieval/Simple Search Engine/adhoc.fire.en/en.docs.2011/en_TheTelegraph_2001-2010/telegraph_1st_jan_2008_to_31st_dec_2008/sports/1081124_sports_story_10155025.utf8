	Mysore: Cases of viral fever have come to light here, as well. In all about 20 horses are learnt to be down with fever, casting a shadow on the entire winter season. As a result, the Mysore Race Club (MRC) stewards have promptly decided to cancel Wednesdays fixture. The MRC officials have been asked to monitor the situation on a war footing, said a source in Bangalore. The stewards decision about the rest of the season will be known by the mid-week, added the source.          
	Mumbai, Delhi and Calcutta have had their share of worries, pertaining to horse-fever cases that had prompted the three turf clubs to postpone their winter seasons which may not see the start for at least another six weeks.          
	Alarm bells are also ringing in Bangalore following 23 cases of fever reported by the Kunigal Stud Farm which is only about 70km from the Bangalore racecourse. One suspected case from a leading stable in Bangalore has already been isolated.

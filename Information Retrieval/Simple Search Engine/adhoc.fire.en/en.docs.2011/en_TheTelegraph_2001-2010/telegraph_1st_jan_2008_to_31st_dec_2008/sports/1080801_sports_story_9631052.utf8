The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Minnows dream of the spotlight
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Minnows dream of the spotlight
                      
	Singapore: Powerhouse nations like China, the US and Russia might grab all the Olympic gold medal attention but the worlds sporting minnows plan to grab at least some of the limelight.         
	While some nations might whinge about winning dozens of medals, others will be glad of just one  and a bronze at that. More than 80 countries competing in Beijing have never before been on the Olympic podium. For a myriad of reasons  political, geographical, financial  their sporting prowess has never matured.         
	Tiny Brunei might be oil rich but when it comes to producing athletes, it is lacking big time. The small monarchy on the island of Borneo will be competing in its fifth summer Olympics but will inevitably go home empty-handed.         
	Bhutan is bigger than Brunei but remains one of the most secluded countries in the world, tucked between Asian heavyweights China and India.         
	Their national sport is archery  competitions are held regularly in villages throughout the monarchy  and they have an outside chance after six games with no joy.         
	Timor-Leste, one of the worlds poorest countries, became the first new nation of the 21st century when it declared independence from Indonesia in 2002, just in time to send a team to Athens. Its key sports are boxing, weightlifting, taekwondo and athletics.         
	But severe shortages of money, facilities and equipment means the nation faces more obstacles than most in achieving its Olympic dream, and only marathon runners Antonio Ramos and Mariana Diaz Ximenez will be in Beijing.         
	Like many Asian nations, Africa has its fair share on non-achievers.         
	While countries like Ethiopia and Kenya have a tradition of churning out world-beating distance runners, the vast majority of Africa nations have never produced the goods.

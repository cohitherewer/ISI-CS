     Sebastian Coe      
	Around this time on Sunday, the world will know London is the next city to host the summer Olympic and Paralympic Games. This magical moment will happen during the closing ceremony of the Beijing Games, when the mayor of Beijing hands the Olympic flag to Boris Johnson, Londons mayor.         
	We will then present our eight-minute show  a youthful, diverse and athletic performance that will act as our invitation to the world to join us in four years time.         
	From then on, the countdown to London hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012 will be under way. And I know the excitement, expectation and value we will bring to the Games will build every day. The atmosphere and anticipation will become infectious.         
	The talk will turn to Wembley and Wimbledon and the impressive new Olympic Park, while the Birds Nest and Water Cube, inevitably, will become part of sporting history.         
	Beijing has been an extraordinary experience, particularly for Team Great Britain, who have surpassed all expectations and excelled, day after day, on the biggest sporting stage in the world.         
	We could not have asked for a better run up to our time in the spotlight than Team GBs performances.         
	In four years time they will have the chance to do it all again, against iconic backdrops and spurred on by passionate, enthusiastic home fans.         
	Our teams great performances at these games is the amalgam of good administration within governing bodies, world-class coaching, elevated levels of funding and hungry and motivated competitors.         
	If you bring those four things together you tend to get people up onto the rostrums. I take my hat off to the work that is being done in the governing bodies, because they have supported some extraordinarily talented competitors.         
	Beijing has given the entire 2012 team an enormous opportunity to see first hand the mechanics of running the biggest event on the planet.         
	It has also been a magnificent celebration of sport for competitors and spectators. Thats what the Olympic Games is all about.         
	Our own celebrations will begin in earnest in Londons Mall on Sunday afternoon with a giant VISA London 2012 party, attended by swimmer Michael Phelps, who won an incredible eight gold medals in Beijing and has already said he intends to compete in London.         
	There will also be a live concert for 40,000 guests, featuring, among others, The Feeling, II Divo, Katherine Jenkins, McFly and Will Young.         
	Its going to be quite a day, both here in China and around the UK, where a network of live screens has been set up in cities across the country to watch both the Olympic Games and the handover moment.         
	Although its too late to get tickets  they were grabbed rather speedily through a free ballot  it will be easy to enjoy the event as it will be broadcast live on BBC One and Radio Two and there are hundreds of complementary events taking place across the country.         
	As part of our handover celebrations more than 400 special flags, with the date and London 2012 emblem, will be raised across the UK including at No. 10 Downing Street and in The Mall. We want the whole country to join in, not just London, in the same way the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games will touch people nationwide.         
	Sundays handover will not be the only major moment in the run up to the London Games.         
	There will be a second, just as important handover, during the closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games in September when well be inviting schools, colleges and local authorities to download a special resource from our website and get involved.         
	So thank you Beijing for being great hosts  now its our turn.

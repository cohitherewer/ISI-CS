	Rome: Russias world and Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva set a world record of 5.03 metres at Romes Golden Gala on Friday.         
	The 26-year-old cleared the bar with ease to surpass the record of 5.01 she set at the 2005 Helsinki World Championships.         
	Her nearest rival on Friday was Polands Monica Pyrek, who vaulted 4.75.         
	Olympic and world champion Jeremy Wariner edged LaShawn Merritt to win the 400m and strike a blow against his American rival ahead of next months Beijing Games.         
	Wariner had a big lead in the final straight but had to hold off a strong late surge from Merritt to win in 44.36, just a hundredth of a second ahead of the 22-year-old.         
	Wariner gained revenge after losing to Merritt at the US Olympic trials last week and at the Berlin Golden League meeting in June although his dominance of the event clearly remains under threat.         
	I got out good, better than at the trials and in Berlin, Wariner told reporters. I knew hed be there at the end. I had to stay relaxed and hang in there. Ive got to work hard and cut out the mistakes from here on in.         
	Jamaican sprinter Asafa Powells Olympic preparations suffered a setback when he pulled up with a groin strain at the end of his 100 metres heat although his manager told reporters that the problem was not serious.         
	Portugals Francis Obikwelu beat Derrick Atkins of the Bahamas on a photo decision in the 100m final after both athletes finished with a time of 10.04.         
	South African double amputee Oscar Pistorius finished seventh in the 400m B race with a time of 46.62 seconds, still short of the Beijing qualifying mark of 45.55.         
	It was his second attempt after being cleared to compete with able-boded athletes by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in May.         
	Kenyan teenager Pamela Jelimo stayed on course for the Golden League jackpot by beating world champion Janeth Jepkosgei in the 800m.         
	Jelimo, 18, clocked 1:55.69 to beat fellow Kenyan Jepkosgei by over three seconds and claim the third of the six series wins needed for a share of the $1 million prize.         
	Croatias Blanka Vlasic is the only other person still in with a chance of the big prize after she won the womens high jump with a leap of two metres.         
	Cuban 110m hurdles world record holder Dayron Robles, who last month ran 12.87 seconds to beat the previous mark set by Chinese Olympic champion Liu Xiang, blew away the field in his event with a 13.08 run.         
	Panamas Irving Saladino, the world long jump champion, leapt 8.3m to top the field in his comeback from a knee injury. Finlands javelin world champion Tero Pitkamaki, who accidentally speared French long jumper Salim Sdiri here last year, triumphed too with a 87.7-m throw.         
	Allyson Felix, the twice 200m world champion, cruised to victory in the womens 400m race with a time of 50.25.           (REUTERS)

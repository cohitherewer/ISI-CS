The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tumour fear for Ballesteros
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tumour fear for Ballesteros

	The golfing world awaits the results of further tests on Seve Ballesteros, which are being carried out at the La Paz Hospital in Madrid. It is feared that the 51-year-old Spaniard, who collapsed at Madrids Barajas Airport eight days ago, is suffering from a brain tumour.         
	The golfers family have stopped taking phone calls and have asked the hospital not to give out any information beyond a statement that will be issued once the extra tests are complete. Everyone is worried that it could be something very bad, said one of Ballesteross oldest friends.         
	Ballesteros released his own statement on Thursday in which he thanked everyone who had expressed concern. I hope you will understand that it is difficult to answer all your messages due to the great number I am receiving, he said.         
	Colin Montgomerie said he was speaking for all his fellow professionals when he wished Ballesteros a speedy recovery. What we are hearing puts everything into perspective in a heartbeat, said the Scot, who played to great effect under Ballesteross captaincy.         
	Seve has this fighting spirit, this never-say-die approach. He has come back from four down with nine to play to defeat both Paul Azinger and Raymond Floyd and he has done much the same against me a couple of times in the Seve Trophy.

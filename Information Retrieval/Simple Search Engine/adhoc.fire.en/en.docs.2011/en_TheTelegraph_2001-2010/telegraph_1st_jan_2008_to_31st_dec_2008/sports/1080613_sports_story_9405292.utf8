The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We put them under pressure right from the start, says Dhoni   Hard work paid off: Gambhir
                                                                                                                                                                                               Hard work paid off: Gambhir
  - We put them under pressure right from the start, says Dhoni             Raqibul Hasan of Bangladesh on way to his 89 during the tri-series match against India in Dhaka on Thursday                           
	Dhaka: Man-of-the-Match Gautam Gambhir, whose unbeaten 107 guided India to a seven-wicket victory over Bangladesh in the tri-series encounter in Dhaka on Thursday, said his hard work has at last paid off.         
	Shortly after his enterprising knock, the left-hander told the media that it was thrilling to play on such a surface.         
	It feels nice to see that all your hard work is paying off Today I was hitting the ball well and I enjoyed batting thoroughly It was thrilling to bat on such a good track like this         
	The Team India opener said he has come of age in the last two years.         
	In the past couple of years I have learnt lot of things and my batting has matured My technique has improved and thats helping me now         
	Gambhir said this was a memorable century for him.         
	This century is quite memorable My job is to keep on scoring and help my team win I am happy that I am doing my job and helping the team I will keep on working hard and maintain the momentum.         
	It is important to hit ball well and I am doing that. I am confident of playing well in the final as well, Gambhir said.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni sounded pleased as punch with his wards. He said they understand their roles and take all the pressure off by completing the tasks assigned to them.         
	Dhoni was speaking after Indias comprehensive win over the hosts in the last league match of the tri-series.         
	It was an easy win. We put them under pressure right from the start. Again it was a good start by (Virender) Sehwag and Gambhir. They understand their roles well and then it becomes easy for the skipper as there is hardly anything to do, Dhoni quipped.         
	India finished on top of the table with 10 points from two wins in as many matches. They now face Pakistan in the final on Saturday.         
	Dhoni allayed fears that the middle-order, which has not really been tested so far, would remain unprepared.         
	Obviously, middle order has not got the chance to bat but thats part and parcel of the game. Lower order has not got the opportunity either. Hopefully, the openers and the top-order should do well in the final but we are confident and prepared, he said.         
	Rival captain Mohammed Ashraful blamed the defeat on the batsmens poor show.         
	Obviously, we were short by 30-40 runs India played good cricket. I and Raqibul (Hasan) put up some 70 runs together but we needed more. It was a very good batting track, he said.         
	Despite the defeat, Ashraful praised Raqibul, who hit a brilliant 89 in Bangladeshs 222, and Mashrafe Mortaza, saying, Raqibul batted well and Mortaza really bowled well.

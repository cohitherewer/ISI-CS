The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wenger is   furious over referee visit
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wenger is   furious over referee visit
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Arsene Wenger                                 
	Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, claimed on Friday evening that the Lancashire referee, Lee Mason, had been influenced into making second-half decisions in Aston Villas favour after John Robertson, Martin Neills No. 2, went to see the official at the interval.         
	I know how it works here, said Wenger, who needed to be separated from Neill during the acrimonious 2-2 draw. The referee gets some stick in the first half and in the second half he gives every decision their way.         
	Wenger was particularly angered by Masons decision to award Villa a second-half penalty when William Gallas brought down Gabby Agbonlahor. It was a penalty, countered Neill.         
	Villas manager confirmed that Robertson had visited Mason during the interval to discuss why a foul had not been given Villas way during the build-up to Arsenals first goal. It was a blatant obstruction, said Neill of the moment Agbonlahor claimed he was blocked by Alex Song. That was upsetting and played on the players minds.         
	I didnt speak to the referee but John Robertson spoke to the referee and asked him to explain the decision on the foul, said Neill. The referee chose not to give an answer.         
	Of his altercation with Wenger, which required Robertson to pull him away, Neill said: It was nothing, much ado about nothing.         
	Villas manager was delighted with the comeback from 2-0 down, saying: Were a match for anybody. It was the least we deserved.         
	He also revealed that his captain, Mark Laursen will be out for up to four weeks with a knee injury sustained against West Ham last week.

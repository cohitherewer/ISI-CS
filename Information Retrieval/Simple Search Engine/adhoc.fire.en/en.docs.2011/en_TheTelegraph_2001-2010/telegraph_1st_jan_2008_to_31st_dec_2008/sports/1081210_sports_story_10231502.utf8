The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Oraon scores a brace
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Oraon scores a brace
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: An inconsequential Federation Cup match between United SC and SBT sprang to life before meandering to a 2-2 draw here at the Barasat Stadium on Tuesday with Uniteds Sankar Oraon scoring a brace, thanks to the all-out strategy of the teams, and some poor defending.         
	None of the teams looked solid and conceded goals at regular intervals. United went ahead in the 17th minute when SBT custodian P.A. Jean Christian failed to stop a cross from the right by United playmaker Snehasish Chakraborty. Sankar Oraon was waiting right behind Christian, hoping for just such a mistake and tapped the ball in with his left foot.         
	In a 2:2 situation, lanky R. Kannan headed the ball inside the box for M.A. Abdul Hakim, who shot home with a right-footer. But United were not to be denied for too long. Basudeb Mondal caught the SBT defence unawares once again in the 26th minute. He lobbed the ball over the head of SBT defenders to find Sankar inside the box.         
	Sankar was spot on with his volley which made it 2-1. One would have expected the Calcutta team to become stronger after regaining the lead but they were perhaps interested only in scoring more goals. They could not do that but conceded another goal. Kannan was the scorer this time.         
	The goal could not have come more easily. All Kannan needed to do was head the Paul Anthony cross. None of the defenders present inside the box tried to intercept the cross. A small spot jump to a precise cross did the trick for SBT.

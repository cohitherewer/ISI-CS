The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai terror puts off Chennai meet
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mumbai terror puts off Chennai meet
                      
	Chennai: The Mumbai terror attacks claimed one more sporting event. The World Squash Doubles Championship, which was to be held in Chennai from December 15, has been postponed due to security concerns expressed by the participating teams.         
	Squash Australia withdrew its team from the event following an advice from their high commission and fearing more such pull outs, the World Squash Federation (WSF) decided to postpone the event.         
	George Mieras, director of the WSF championships committee, discussed the matter with the management committee of WSF before postponing the tournament.         
	I consulted the management committee of WSF who told me to put first and foremost the safety of all players entered.         
	My sad but now inevitable conclusion is to advise you that we must not go ahead at this time in Chennai, Mieras wrote in his letter to WSF president N. Ramachandran.         
	The championships committee will seek in conjunction with SRFI to find a suitable date to reschedule the Doubles during 2009, Mieras added.         
	Meanwhile, Mieras said despite his reassurance, Squash Australia went by the advice from their high commission and decided not to travel to Chennai.         
	Australia therefore withdrew their players last night. It seems quite clear to me that other high commissions are likely to give the same advice and it is not appropriate for me to counter this.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Important to be positive, says Mike Hussey
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Important to be positive, says Mike Hussey
                      
	Melbourne: His teammates may not fancy facing the likes of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh on Indian dust bowls but Australia batsman Mike Hussey wants his colleagues to stay positive when they arrive in India for a four-match Test series starting next month.         
	Hussey has been in consistent form in the ODI series against Bangladesh but the left-hander believes playing India in their backyard would be the toughest test of his career. The key, he says, would be to maintain a positive intent and not get bogged down by the Indian spinners.         
	The team that won in 04, they said that was probably their Everest. I dont think thats changing. India are up there in the top two or three teams in the world and I think its going to be a wonderful series. Its probably the hardest place to win in international cricket, Hussey was quoted as saying.         
	Hussey says he has worked out a plan which, he hopes, would be enough to negate Kumble and Co.         
	...You need to be able to tick it over, need to be able to score and put the pressure back on them a little bit.         
	Its important to be positive, youve got to know where you can get off strike. If theyre just bowling ball after ball at you and youre looking to survive, theyre going to get you out, theres no question.         
	My game is a more conservative game, playing the percentages, so Im probably not going to be looking to do anything outlandish to put the pressure on, but Ill certainly be looking to be positive, said Hussey, whose workload in the middle-order would only increase in case Andrew Symonds, who is pondering his future, misses the tour.         
	Were pretty much up in the air at the moment, Hussey said. Were certainly not settled on anything. Luckily for us, the experienced players that can come back in to the team, such as Ponting, Hayden, Symonds, Lee, they know their games very well.         
	Meanwhile, Symonds may have to miss next months India tour following the fishing saga but the volatile Australian allrounder will still earn as much as any other Cricket Australia (CA) contracted player by just cooling off his heels at home.         
	CA will continue to pay Symonds his retainer regardless of whether he tours India or not, plus match payments for games he wont play. (AGENCIES)

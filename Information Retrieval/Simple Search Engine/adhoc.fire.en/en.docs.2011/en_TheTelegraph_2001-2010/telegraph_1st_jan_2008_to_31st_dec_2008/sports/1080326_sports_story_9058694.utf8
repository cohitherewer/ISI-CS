	The BCCI deserves full praise for standing by its team in the crisis that has enveloped it after Harbhajan Singh was handed out a three-match ban by the Match Referee for a racial slur at Andrew Symonds. The off-spinner has denied having used the word which has caused offence, and in the absence of any audio recording and most crucially with both umpires not having heard it, the charge should have been dropped straightaway for lack of corroborating evidence.         
	By accepting the word of the Australian players and not the Indian players, the Match Referee has exposed himself to the charge of taking a decision based not on facts, but on emotion. Worse still, his decision has incensed millions of Indians. Quite understandably they are asking why his decision shouldnt be considered a racist one considering the charges that were levied on Harbhajan were of racism.         
	Millions of Indians want to know if it was a white man taking the white mans word against that of the brown man. Quite simply if there was no audio evidence nor did the officials hear anything then the charge did not stand.         
	This is what has incensed the millions of Indians who are flabbergasted that the word of one of the greatest players in the history of the game, Sachin Tendulkar, was not accepted.         
	In effect, Tendulkar has been branded a liar by the Match Referee               
	Note: Sunil Gavaskar made these observations soon after the controversial Sydney Test in January

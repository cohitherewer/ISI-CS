	London: South Africa captain Graeme Smith came to his sides rescue on Sunday with a fighting 107 which may help salvage a draw in the first Test against England at Lords.         
	Smith added 204 for the first wicket with Neil McKenzie, who was still at the crease on 102 after South Africa had been asked to follow on Saturday 346 runs in arrears.         
	At the close, South Africa were 242 for one, needing 104 to make England bat again with a days play remaining.         
	Smith, who was out for eight in the first innings, was unable to capitalise on a huge slice of good fortune after reaching his century in the final session.         
	An edge off Kevin Pietersens occasional off-spin, which seemed destined for Paul Collingwood at first slip, went through Tim Ambroses gloves as the wicketkeeper lunged to his left.         
	However, he was out without adding a run when a skied pull shot off James Anderson was taken safely by Pietersen running in from backward point. The England team and a near-capacity crowd gathered on a fine, sunny morning started the day with high hopes that England were about to end a sequence of five successive Test draws at crickets world headquarters.         
	Instead the South African openers, resuming on 13 for no wicket, gradually took command on a pitch offering nothing to the bowlers except for some slow spin for Monty Panesar, who took four for 74 in the first innings.         
	Panesar was introduced into the attack 48 minutes after the start of play and captain Michael Vaughan placed close fielders on both sides of the pitch.         
	The left-arm spinner made the occasional delivery deviate from the bowlers footmarksbut the only semblance of a chance in the opening session was a faint inside edge from Smith which hit the unfortunate Ambroses pads.         
	South Africa, who lunched at 67 without loss, carried on where they had left off after the interval, playing straight and running swiftly between the wickets. Smith reached his 23rd Test fifty in 10 minutes short of three hours and brought up the 100 partnership with a controlled glide for four to third man.         
	McKenzie completed his 15th Test half-century in 234 minutes from 190 balls.         
	Smith, using his height to drive confidently through the off-side, went on after tea to compile his 15th Test century with 11 fours from 186 balls followed shortly by the 200 partnership.         
	It was South Africas 10th opening partnership of 200 or more in Test cricket and Smith, who scored 259 in his only previous Test at Lords, has been involved in seven.         
	McKenzie, who had played an excellent supporting role, reached his fifth Test century with a scampered single just before the close. It was his first hundred against England and came in 307 balls.

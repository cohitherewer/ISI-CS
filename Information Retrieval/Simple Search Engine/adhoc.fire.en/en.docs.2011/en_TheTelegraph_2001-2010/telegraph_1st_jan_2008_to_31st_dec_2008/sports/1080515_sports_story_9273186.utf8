                                                                                                                                                                                           IHF moves court
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The deposed Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill has moved court challenging the decision of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).         
	According to highly placed sources, the Delhi high court on Wednesday has issued a notice to the centre. Justice Rekha Sharma has asked the centre to file its response on the IHF petition by July 9 when the matter would be taken up for further hearing.         
	The IHF, through its counsel D.K. Sharma, contended that the action taken against it was illegal and unauthorised as it was dissolved without being served a show cause notice to respond to the allegations.         
	The IOA president Suresh Kalmadi admitted that a case has been filed. He, however, refused to comment on the issue. Gill could not be reached despite repeated efforts.         
	The IHF was suspended by the IOA on April 28 for undesirable activities and for bringing the sport to disrepute. The decision later was supported by the ministry of sports.         
	The IOA called an emergency meeting of its executive committee after a television news channel showed IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran allegedly accepting bribe for including a player in the senior national team.         
	The IOA has already formed an ad hoc committee, headed by Kalmadi, to look after the affairs of the game in the country.

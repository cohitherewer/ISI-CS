	Sydney: Australia will celebrate the centenary of their greatest sporting legend Donald Bradman on Wednesday by naming the star batsmans sleepy boyhood hometown the worlds spiritual home of cricket.         
	School children, Hollywood stars, cricketers and Australians from all walks of life were expected to mark what would have been the 100th birthday of the famed cricketer on August 27. Bradman died in 2001 aged 92.         
	The accolades were already pouring in Tuesday, with Australias current cricket captain Ricky Ponting praising the man known here simply as the Don as the games untouchable superhero.         
	Its almost like hes separate from the game, Ponting said.         
	His name and what he achieved, its so far out of any players reach, in his time or any player who has played since, its almost like he played a different game to what were playing.         
	He would have been the stand-out player whatever generation he played in.         
	The chairman of the Bradman Foundation, Michael Ball, said excitement was building west of Sydney in Bowral, population 11,500, where Bradman spent his early years and where a cricketing museum bears his name.         
	Ball said that among the celebrations, the Bradman museum would announce that it would be expanded to include an international cricket hall of fame.         
	It would become the worlds spiritual home of cricket  Don being by far the best cricketer of all time, Ball said.         
	It will not only be the Bradman museum but it will be the international cricket hall of fame whose captain will be Don Bradman and the team will be obviously the best, Ball said.         
	The initial team of 12 people will be from all over the world  I dont know exactly who they will be but they will include people like Sachin Tendulkar from India.         
	The first 12 would be chosen by a panel of selectors headed by former Australian captain and long-time commentator Richie Benaud.         
	Among those likely to feature on the list would be West Indian allrounder Garfield Sobers and Britains Leonard Hutton and Wally Hammond, Ball said.           (AFP)

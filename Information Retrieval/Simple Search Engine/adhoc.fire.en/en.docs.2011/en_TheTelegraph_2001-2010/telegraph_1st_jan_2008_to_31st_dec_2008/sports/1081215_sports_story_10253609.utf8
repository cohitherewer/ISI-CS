	Chandigarh: Indian golf pro Jeev Milkha Singh has raised the bar for himself and wants to break into the top 20 by the end of the next year.         
	The year 2008 has been magical for Jeev, yielding four titles on three different tours, besides fetching him the Asian Tour Order of Merit for the second time in his career.         
	The success has only whetted his appetite and the seasoned Indian, currently ranked 36th, is now hoping to shine in majors and eyeing wins in the PGA and European Tours to break into the top 20 in the golf rankings.         
	Im pleased with my form and this was my best year so far. But I hope it would be even better next year, Jeev said.         
	I feel that Im capable of a top 10 finish in major championship and my goal is to be among top 20 by 2009, he said, vowing to do whatever it takes to achieve the feat.         
	I have gained lot of confidence and trust in my swing. Besides, I am more confident under pressure now, he added.         
	Jeev won the Bank of Austria on the European Tour and triumphed at the Singapore Open, besides his twin victories on the Japan Tour, the last of which came in extraordinary circumstances.         
	Recuperating in a Tokyo hospital after delivering a stillborn, his wife Kudrat sent a shattered Jeev back to the course and the Indian went on to win the Nippon series JT cup, undoubtedly his most emotional triumph.         
	It was a tough week, Jeev said.         
	I went into the tournament without having hit a single ball and that too after persuasion from my wife... I dedicate this win to my wife, she was strong enough to send me to the field, Jeev said.         
	Overall, Jeev said, it was a very productive year and the triumph in Singapore was special because of the star-studded field there.         
	I played very well in 2008. However, Singapore open in Sentosa on Asian tour was the best performance as the field was fantastic, he said.           (PTI)

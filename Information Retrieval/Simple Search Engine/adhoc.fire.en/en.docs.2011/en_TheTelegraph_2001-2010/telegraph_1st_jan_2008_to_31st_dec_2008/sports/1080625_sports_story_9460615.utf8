The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Germans seem too strong for Turks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Germans seem too strong for Turks
  - Waiting for Hiddink to do an encore against Spain

	As I sit down to pen my thoughts on the eve of the Euro 2008 semi-finals, my heart goes out to Dutch coach Marco van Basten. I still vividly remember the spectacular goal he scored against the then Soviet Union in the 1988 Euro Cup final, but against Russia last Friday, he seemed truly baffled. Never in his dream did he imagine that Russia would play at such a pace, that, too, during extra time. While there is no denying that midfielder Andrei Arshavin terrorised The Netherlands with his pace and skill but it was Russias coach Guus Hiddink who actually plotted Dutch downfall with astute planning. He knew Arshavin was his trump card and used him adroitly.        
	Naturally, as a coach, I am eagerly waiting for Hiddink to do an encore against Spain in the semi-finals. This time it will be even more difficult as Spain would be ready to counter Russias tactics. In the group league, Spain outclassed the Russians 4-1 but there will be a major difference this time as Arshavin will be there to lead the attack.        
	Arshavin looks to be the most attractive player in this edition by far. He is a clever customer and a shrewd planner of off the ball tactics. He also has terrific speed with the ball, can pass it well and possesses fine dribbling skill. Against Spain, I have a feeling that Hiddink may give Arshavins role a twist to avoid predictability. But in the end, if the Russians have to succeed, they will need this boy. Russias entire mechanism depends on this midfielder.        
	On Thursday, Spains main aim will be to slow down Arshavin. It is not going to be easy as the midfielder is currently enjoying good form and the Spanish backline hasnt shown much of an enterprise in the last four matches. They have committed some silly mistakes and it will be up to Puyol to manage the line there. In the up front, Spain have Fernando Torres and David Villa who are capable of beating any defence in the world.        
	I am aware that there are now two clear-cut favourites in the semi-finals with Germany expected to overcome Turkey and Spain tipped to beat Russia. But since many things in this current Euro Cup have gone against the grain, I would like to believe that there are no underdogs.        
	I do believe that Turkey have the ability to go further but few people are giving them a chance. After all, Turkey would face a tough time as a number of their key players such as skipper Nihat Kahveci, Tuncay Sanli, Arda Turan and Emre Asik will not be there because of injury and suspension. They played important roles in their teams miraculous run in this tournament but the Turks will now have to do without them.         
	Though as a football fan I love to watch upsets, Germans are unlikely to offer any such opportunity to Turkey. Experts frowned upon Germanys defensive organisation at the start but were completely silenced after the quarter final against Portugal.        
	They contained Cristiano Ronaldo, considered the best player in the world, in the most effective manner. Though Turkey have now become famous for erasing a deficit in the dying moments of the game, they will have to work really hard to maintain their reputation as the comeback kids of the Euro 2008.        
	Germanys aim will be to capitalise on the weaknesses of Turkey. Skipper and midfielder Michael Ballack will now be supremely confident after his stupendous strike against Portugal and will look to create havoc in the midfield. There is Bastian Schweinsteiger, the best feeder in the Euro Cup, and if Lukas Podolski can use his amazing left foot to good effect, the Germans can do some serious damage.        
	So far, it has been a feast of football in Euro 2008. Every game has featured sublime skill, great drama and plenty of twists to keep the fans entertained. I hope the last three games also go in the same direction.

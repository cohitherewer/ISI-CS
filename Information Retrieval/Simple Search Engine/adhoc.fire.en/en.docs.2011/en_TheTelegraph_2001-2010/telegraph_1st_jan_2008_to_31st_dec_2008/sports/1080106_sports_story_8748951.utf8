	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan continued their good run with a 1-0 win over Mahindra United in the ninth-round match of the ONGC I-League at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday evening. Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto scored the winner in the 68th minute.         
	Mahindra, who played cautiously in the first half with an accent on counter-attacks, lost the plot after the change of ends. It was clear that the visitors wanted to avoid defeat in the away match, but Barreto  a key player in Mahindras NFL-winning campaign in 2005-06  upset their plans.         
	We were not defensive We wanted to play on counter-attacks, Mahindra coach Derick Pereira said at the post-match conference.         
	Both sides had their moments but failed to force the issue till Barreto decided to make his presence felt. The Brazilian headed home from a James Singh cross from the right.         
	Man-of-the-Match Peter Odafe had a good day in office. The Nigerian combined well with N. S. Manju and Habibur Rehman Mondal, managing to keep a Yusif Yakubu-less forwardline (Sushil Singh and Mohammed Rafi) at bay.         
	Mohun Bagan came close to scoring in the ninth minute, when a Dharamjit Singh left-footer from 35 yards was fisted away by an acrobatic Sandip Nandy. The man under the bar at the other end  Shilton Paul  had to be at his best to keep out a Manjit Singh pile-driver.         
	Douglas da Silva also played his part well, as a defensive screen. But Bhaichung Bhutia was off colour, and that prevented Mohun Bagan from increasing the tally.         
	After the goalless first half, Mohun Bagan upped the tempo. They launched one attack after another, but found it difficult to beat the Mahindra defenders. It was left to the peerless Barreto to do the trick.         
	Carlos Roberto Pereira was satisfied with the result. I just want to win every match, even if the margin is 1-0. You cant expect us to win 10-0 against a team like Mahindra, said the Brazilian coach.         
	Saturdays win took Mohun Bagan to fourth place with 14 points. Mahindra remained on 11 and finished the first phase of the 10-team competition at fifth spot.

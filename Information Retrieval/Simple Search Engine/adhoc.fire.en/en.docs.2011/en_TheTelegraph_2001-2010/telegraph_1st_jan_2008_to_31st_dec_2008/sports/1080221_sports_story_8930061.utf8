The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Trivedi checks North march
                                                   Trivedi checks North march
                      
	Mumbai: North Zone were bowled out for 340, thanks to a brilliant bowling display by pacer Siddharth Trivedi on the second day of the Duleep Trophy final at the Wankhede here on Wednesday.         
	Earlier West Zone were dismissed for 274.         
	Trivedi (six for 67) could not stop North taking a crucial 66-run lead due to some defiant batting by their lower order. At stumps, West Zone were two for no loss in their second innings.         
	Openers Aakash Chopra and Shikhar Dhawan gave North a good start. Both fell to Trivedi for 35 and 30, respectively. Four balls after Chopra was sent back to the pavilion, Trivedi found the edge of Karan Goels bat and later sent captain Mithun Manhas packing for 26.         
	Yashpal Singh (59) and Rajat Bhatia (84) consolidated the innings and added 128 runs for the fifth wicket.         
	Bhatia fell to Trivedi after smacking nine boundaries and a six.         
	Trivedi was well supported by left-arm spinner Rakesh Dhruv who pick up three wickets.         
	However, West Zone could not wrap up the innings after Bhatia fell with the total on 271. Tailenders VRV Singh (33) and A. K. Thakur (33) put on a partnership of 66 for the 10th wicket.

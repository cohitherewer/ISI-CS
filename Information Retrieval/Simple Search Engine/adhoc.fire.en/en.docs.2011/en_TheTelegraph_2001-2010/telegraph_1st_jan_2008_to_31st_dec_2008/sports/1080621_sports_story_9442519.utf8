	Life ban on Slovak shot putter  Bratislava, (Slovakia): Slovak shot putter Mikulas Konopka faces a life ban for a second doping offence. The Slovak athletics federation said Friday that Konopka tested positive for metandienon in an out-of-competition control.   This is his second doping offence after testing positive for the banned steroid stanozolol in 2002, when he was given a two-year ban. IAAF rules call for a life ban after a second doping violation.   The Slovak federation is expected to rule on Konopka rsquo;s case next month.   The 29-year-old Konopka won Slovakia rsquo;s first gold at the European indoor Championships last year.    
	Nadia in final  Eastbourne: Eighth seed Nadia Petrova produced a ldquo;boom-boom ending rdquo; to beat Australian Samantha Stosur 6-3, 6-3 on Friday and reach the final of the Eastbourne International tournament.  The Russian surrendered only two points in the final two games and finished off with a thundering ace to book her place in Saturday rsquo;s final of the grasscourt event against either second seed Marion Bartoli or No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska.  Petrova, a semi-finalist here last year before having to pull out with injury, began making errors at the start of the second set and had to save two break points in the first game. Luckily for her, Stosur, who has won 22 doubles titles but none in singles, was even more error-prone and failed to convert two more break points in the seventh game.
  Ferrer wins    
	Ferrer wins  Den Bosch: Top seed David Ferrer reached his first career final on grass in Den Bosch on Friday by defeating Argentine Juan Martin Del Potro 7-6, 6-1. After a tight first set mdash; in which the French Open quarter finalist saved two break points to take on a tie-break mdash; Del Potro rsquo;s resistance was broken.  ldquo;My first final on grass, it rsquo;s unbelievable, rdquo; Ferrer told reporters, after wrapping up a one-sided second set. ldquo;It rsquo;s important to play well before Wimbledon, for the confidence. rdquo;
  World No. 5 Ferrer, a winner in Valencia and runner-up in Barcelona earlier this year, goes into Saturday rsquo;s final against France rsquo;s Marc Gicquel without dropping a set all week.      
	Bernie threat  London: Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has threatened to switch the British Grand Prix from Silverstone to Donington Park after 2009. quot;We are discussing the possibility of reaching an agreement with Donington to host the British Grand Prix, quot; Ecclestone said on Friday. quot;We are trying to save the British Grand Prix and we want it to be staged at a venue which befits an event of its stature. I've been in negotiations for a long time and whether or not we're going to do a deal with Donington or Silverstone, I don't know. Donington have said they are going to build everything we want. Have they got the money? Only time will tell. But I think there is more chance of Donington having the money than the BRDC, rdquo; added the Briton.

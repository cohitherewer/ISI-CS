                                                                                                                                                                                                     Assam tie still uncertain
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In the wake of the security situation, Bengal may consider not going to Assam for their Ranji Trophy Plate Group tie scheduled to be held from December 5-8. Bengal coach Utpal Chatterjee hinted at such a possibility at the Eden on Friday.         
	There is no such proposal from the CAB till now. But if the authorities think its not safe for us to go there and play, we might decide against going, Utpal said.         
	The India versus England ODI scheduled in Guwahati on Saturday has already been cancelled as the England team decided to return to their country after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.         
	Bengals consultant Mohinder Amarnath supported the decision of the England team to go back. I think its the right thing to do, he said.

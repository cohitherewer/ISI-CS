                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tiwary to stay with Bengal
            A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj Tiwary                           
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary said he has decided to stay on and play for Bengal, who were relegated to the plate division last season, in the upcoming Ranji Trophy, clearing all doubts about his future involvement with the state cricket on Saturday.         
	After a meeting with the newly elected Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya, Tiwary said it was also his responsibility to play for Bengal and get the state back into the elite division.         
	Senior Bengal cricketers Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Ranadeb Bose along with the full team also met Dalmiya on Saturday.         
	Jhulan Goswami and Priyanka Roy, members of the Indian womens cricket team, too, met the CAB president on Saturday evening before leaving for their England tour.         
	During the discussion with Dalmiya, the players also brought up the Kookaburra ball issue. It may be recalled that the Bengal cricketers had to practice with red balls last season, while the tournament was played with the Kookaburra balls.         
	Biswarup Dey, the newly elected joint secretary, claimed that 10 new Kookaburra balls have been discovered from former joint-secretary Amitava Banerjees cupboard on Saturday.         
	It was also decided on Saturday that Bengal will skip the Moin-ud Dowla tournament.         
	Meanwhile, Adrian Le Roux will supervise the fitness camp for the senior Bengal cricketers, to be held from September 11.

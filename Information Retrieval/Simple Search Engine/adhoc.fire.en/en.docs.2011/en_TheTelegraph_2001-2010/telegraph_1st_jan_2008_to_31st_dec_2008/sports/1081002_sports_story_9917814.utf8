The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A different experience: Srikkanth
                                                                                                                                                                                                     A different experience: Srikkanth
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Enjoyable A different experience, is how chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth described his off-the-field debut in Mumbai on Wednesday.         
	The former India captain did so via an SMS to The Telegraph.         
	Srikkanth, however, declined to take questions as the national selectors have been directed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to refrain from communicating with the media.         
	A gag of sorts was already in place, but the new president, Shashank Manohar, gave a reminder during his interaction with Srikkanth and Co. at the Cricket Centre.         
	Srikkanth is heading the first pro selection committee in Indian sport, not just cricket.         
	Manohar, one learns, spoke to the selectors for around 25 minutes and assured them that there would be no interference in the discharge of their duties.         
	Nobody is confirming, given its sensitive nature, but it appears the future of the Fab Five  Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S.Laxman  was discussed.         
	Perhaps, informally, at least.         
	N.Srinivasan, the BCCI secretary, was present during Manohars session with the selectors.

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Cricket Association of Bengal president Prasun Mukherjee does not wish to blame any individual for Bengals disastrous showing in the Ranji Trophy. 
    
	Its a team game and so theres no point blaming any individual for this disappointing show, Mukherjee said on Thursday after returning from Melbourne where he had gone as part of the BCCI delegation for Sourav Gangulys 100th Test. 
    
	Bengal, runners-up for the last two seasons, were relegated to Plate this season. 
    
	You cannot pin point any specific reason. Ups and downs are a part of life he added. 
    
	Mukherjee said no decision had been taken on setting up a committee to look into the reasons behind the debacle.

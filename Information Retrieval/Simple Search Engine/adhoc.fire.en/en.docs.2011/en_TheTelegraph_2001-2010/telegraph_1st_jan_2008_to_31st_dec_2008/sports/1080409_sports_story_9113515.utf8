The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis does not impress me, says Niki Lauda
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lewis does not impress me, says Niki Lauda

	Perspective is an elusive quality in sport. A dose of it is what Lewis Hamilton requires as he repairs in the Alpine air ahead of next weeks test in Barcelona. Elation, disappointment, dismay; Hamilton has experienced all three in successive races. He could not get out of Bahrain quick enough following a rare pointless grand prix.         
	Niki Lauda believes Hamilton is labouring under the weight of expectation. The triple world champion has a point. Hamiltons boyish, insouciant smile of a year ago has gone, replaced by the hardened mask of the pro. Yet he is barely 23 years old, still learning the ropes of adulthood. Technically he is at the top of the driving game. Temperamentally he is at first base.         
	For the first time in his short career Hamilton did not linger to share his thoughts in Bahrain. The emotions of a strained weekend were too raw and he was excused his usual post-race obligations. McLaren were biffed down the pecking order by BMW. Ferrari won without needing top gear. The championship lead has gone. It could get worse before it gets better.         
	This is the story of a sporting life. The moral is you cant win them all. When he stops beating himself up, a glance at the old scoreboard will reveal 14 points on the board, only five adrift of world champion Kimi Raikkonen. Given the shape Ferrari are in, that is a good place, not bad.         
	So Hamilton needs to draw breath, have a beer with the lads in the local canton and return to the car ready to play the long game. Lauda does a fine line in straight talking. Not all share his bleak assessment of Hamilton, but there is some truth in what he says.         
	At the moment he does not impress me, Lauda said. I thought he would become better this year but he has become worse. He is in pretty bad shape. The crash with Alonso, and in practice on Friday, was absolutely needless. He showed nothing in this race. I think that is because of the pressure he is putting himself under.         
	There was some reflection in the Bahrain paddock on the life of the legendary Jim Clark, whose career met its tragic end in the trees at Hockenheim 40 years ago on Monday. Clark and Stirling Moss regularly battle it out with the likes of Fangio and Senna in the imaginations of most grand prix lovers for the accolade of best driver in the world.         
	When his time is done Hamiltons name may well enter the debate. For now there are lessons to learn, challenges to meet. McLaren have a fortnight in the Woking lab and on the test track at Barcelona to address the issues that saw them eclipsed by BMW in race trim in Bahrain. Chief executive Martin Whitmarsh believes both man and machine will be back on the pace in Spain.         
	Lewis is disappointed. If a racing driver of his calibre comes out of a race in 13th place and does not feel that way we have a bit of a worry. Last year he had a dream start followed by a bit of a roller-coaster at the end, Whitmarsh said.         
	We know Lewis very well. We have worked with him for 11 years. Im sure he will go away and see Europe as a fresh start. The championship is wide open with three teams separated by a cluster of points. If we have mal-performed in two of the first three races, we are still in a reasonable position. We have to see that in a positive light.         
	The muse is with Ferrari, and the fast-improving BMW. But if any organisation has the resources and will to counter in Catalunya it is McLaren. The reality is we have to regroup, Whitmarsh said. We have a big upgrade package coming. We know it is a decent step forward. We have underperformed in the past two races, so this offers an opportunity to reflect.         
	The nature of the competition means you have to have a car that is inherently fast, set it up well, adapt across a weekend, make no procedural mistakes and race well. We didnt pull all those things together in the way that we needed to in the past couple of races.         
	There is negligible amount of development you can do in the first three races. All the teams will expect to have decent performance upgrades for Spain. Hopefully ours is better. The championship is tight. Unless you get it right across a whole weekend you are not going to get the result. That is what we need to do in Barcelona.

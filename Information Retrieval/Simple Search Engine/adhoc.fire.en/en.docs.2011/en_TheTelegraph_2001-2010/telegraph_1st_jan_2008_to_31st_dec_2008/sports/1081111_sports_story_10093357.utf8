                                                                                                                                                                                                     Result shows seniors are good enough: Sourav
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                
	Nagpur: Sourav Ganguly addressed the media for one last time as a player, at the end of the fourth Test against Australia here on Monday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Your feelings after the series         
	I feel very happy to win the Test and the series. We played outstandingly. To win the series 2-0 against the best side in the world is very satisfying. After the first Test in Bangalore, I thought we dominated all the three Tests.         
	In the last six matches against Australia, we have won three and drawn three. What does it tell you about Indian cricket?         
	India have always played well against Australia, not only in Perth this year but also in the past. We are the only side, which has competed against them well. It holds good for Indian cricket in future. At the same time, it shows the seniors are good enough. My time is up, but Sachin, Rahul and Laxman are still fantastic.                 
	On your retirement         
	I have had my time. There is a time for everyone to leave. I am happy with the way things have gone. I had a good series, we have beaten the best team in the world. There were lots of doubts after we came back from Sri Lanka. But the way this series has finished, I am ready to sacrifice a year of cricket for that.         
	Any chance there might come a day when you reconsider your retirement?         
	No. No question of reconsideration. Like I said, the way this match finished, its probably one of the best finishes I have seen in terms of a team performance. I am ready to sacrifice 10-12 Test matches for this performance.         
	Did the events of the last Test against Australia here in 2004 come to your mind?         
	I dont want to talk about the past. Things happen in sport, you play well sometimes you dont play well sometimes. Nagpur has been a happy hunting ground for the team. We once again proved that we are a good team.         
	Greg Chappell.         
	(Cuts in) Lets keep the controversy away. Its a happy day for Indian cricket. The Greg Chappell issue has been over and done with. Lets not bring that again, lets respect him. Lets respect whatever has happened.         
	The one thing you would take with you from your career         
	I think toughness. It was more than what many people thought I had. I have had questions asked right through my career. I am happy that I have overcome all of them and am here today because of my ability and toughness.         
	How was it to be asked by Mahendra Singh Dhoni to be the honorary captain for a few overs?         
	Id already switched off... He woke me up and I didnt know what was happening. Luckily, it was already nine down... I did it for three overs and then said to him its his job...         
	What do you think of Dhonis captaincy?         
	He has done well so far. Hes won in T20 World Cup, in Australia in the ODIs and beat Australia here. He has got the ability to take Indian cricket forward. Dhonis got the spark on the field and, like me, isnt much of a drawing-board captain... He also has the luck which captains need.         
	You took your shirt off (after the end of the match) again         
	They (fans) were waving at me, and just I took if off and gave my shirt.         
	Its been a long journey         
	Its been satisfying to get a 100 in my first Test and captain India in 49 Tests, and building a team and players which has helped take Indian cricket forward. If anybody had told me that I would go through all this, I wouldnt have believed him. But God has been kind to me and I have been able to finish off with a win for Indian cricket.         
	Any plans to pen an autobiography?         
	Will see. It takes a lot of time and patience. I dont know if I have the patience.         
	What you think is your legacy?         
	Its not just me since I have always believed a captain is as good as his team. Its the raising of Indian crickets image in the world. The phase from 2000 to 2005 and even now it is continuing, the Indian crickets image has gone up. We were seen as a soft touring side. It has changed considerably. I think we are a formidable side home and away.         
	What about Indias fast bowling?         
	Ishant, Zaheer and Sreesanth  I have a lot of faith in Sreesanth. Hopefully, he gets his head right and gets back into the game. But they will miss Kumble overseas because it is not just about taking wickets but also about controlling the game. Hopefully, Bhajji will take that responsibility.         
	The crowd was really cheering for you         
	It shows your contribution to the game. These people didnt have an agenda... Ill cherish this for life.         
	Did the events of Sydney Test play a role in Indias win?         
	Its a long way behind and to be honest, every game is a new game. When you play such a strong team, you wake up and perform everyday.         
	Which do you consider to be your best win?         
	My best series will be the 2001 and 2003-04 series against Australia. We have won at other places as well, in Pakistan, the West Indies and England, but those two series will be my best.         
	Your opinion about Ishant Sharma         
	He has got an outstanding future. It will depend on selectors and MS, how they handle him. He has to be given breaks and kept fresh.         
	Captaincy, batting or the comeback, which of the three would you like to be known for?         
	All the three. It will be very difficult to separate any one of them. Captaincy, I just did what I believed was right. I was lucky to have Sachin, Rahul, Laxman, Sehwag and Harbhajan probably playing their best cricket at that stage between 2000 and 2005. That definitely helped.         
	Were you disappointed with the last-ball duck?         
	I was more disappointed with the 85 I got. I was so close to getting a hundred.         
	Wasnt it a bit dramatic?         
	I dont know whether one duck made my career dramatic. It was dramatic in any case.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lara: Ricky can go past Sachin 
                            
	The following are excerpts (in alphabetical order):         
	Zaheer Abbas: Sachin is a superb player of any bowling and under any conditions. The way he has kept on scoring runs all these years proves his staying power and quality.         
	Brian Lara: Ricky Ponting (10,239 runs) is the guy who can break Sachins record. He is young enough. I think he is a class player, who may take away the record from Sachin in the future. I feel very proud to be in the same league as Sunil Gavaskar, Allan Border and Sachin Tendulkar. We all have to appreciate what Sachin has done.         
	Hanif Mohammed: I am very happy to see Sachin achieve this record. I have been waiting for it because it is a pleasure watching him bat.         
	Jonty Rhodes: I think his consistency on the field and off the field is great. He is a real character and a man. He is an inspiration for all.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth: It is fantastic to know that an Indian is the highest run-getter in the world. In the past we had Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin has done it again for us. It is a great sense of pride for the Indians.         
	Dilip Vengsarkar: My heartiest congratulations to him. He is a genius. He has been working hard and I feel he should be playing for at least a year or two.         
	Gundappa Viswanath: He always kept a very cool mind throughout, whether he is playing or even otherwise. That shows the greatness of Sachin Tendulkar. (agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan invites WI for Test series
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pakistan invites WI for Test series
                      
	Karachi: Desperate to have some sort of international cricket for its team, the Pakistan Cricket Board has invited West Indies to play to Tests here in November.         
	We have formally asked the West Indies board to send their team to play two Tests in Pakistan immediately after the three match one-day series ends in Abu Dhabi, Shafqat Naghmi, PCB CEO, said on Friday.         
	Naghmi said since Pakistan had little international cricket this year due to the postponement of the Champions Trophy, they were trying to arrange matches to offset financial and cricketing setbacks.         
	We are hopeful the West Indies will respond positively or else this year we just have the one-day series in Abu Dhabi and a Twenty20 four-nation event in Toronto in October, he said.         
	He added that the board was also in talks with New Zealand to arrange something in December. (PTI)

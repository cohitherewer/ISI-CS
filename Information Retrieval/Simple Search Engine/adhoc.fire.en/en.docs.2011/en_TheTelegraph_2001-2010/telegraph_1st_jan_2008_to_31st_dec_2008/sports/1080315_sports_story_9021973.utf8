            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A London-based sports marketing group is planning to bring some English Premier League clubs to India.         
	The company, called ABA, has submitted a proposal to the All India Football Federation (AIFF), saying that some English clubs can be involved in a few exhibition matches in India.         
	Khalid Mahmood  the company chairman who is currently in Delhi  said he was interested in bringing teams like Oldham, Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City and Wigan Athletics to India.         
	At least six players from the first XI of each club can be arranged during their tour of India, Mahmood said.         
	The company, which has a tie-up with Bangladesh Football Federation, is also willing to arrange a tour of India by England C team in June. If the AIFF agrees, the team can play matches against Indian national team, Mahmood said.         
	India has a huge market. We want to sit with the AIFF to spell out our long-term plans. We can take teams from India to Europe and vice versa, he said.         
	AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco admitted meeting the ABA officials. I have asked them to submit a detailed proposal. We will discuss it with out executive committee members before arriving at any decision.

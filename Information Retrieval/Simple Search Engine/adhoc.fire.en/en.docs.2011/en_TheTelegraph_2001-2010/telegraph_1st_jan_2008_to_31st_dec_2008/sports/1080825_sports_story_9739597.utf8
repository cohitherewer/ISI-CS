The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC defers Trophy till October 2009
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ICC defers Trophy till October 2009
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Sunday decided to postpone next months Champions Trophy in Pakistan till October 2009 after failing to remove the reservations of some of the participating countries about the security in Pakistan.         
	The Telegraph had mentioned on Sunday that the ICC may have no choice but to defer the tournament.         
	ICC president David Morgan said that the board unanimously decided to postpone the tournament and Pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament.         
	There was complete support and sympathy for the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the situation it finds itself in, which is not of its making, Morgan said in a statement after a teleconference of the ICC executive board.         
	Pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the ICC board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location, the statement added.         
	South Africa pulled out of the eight-nation tournament scheduled from September 12-28 on Friday despite assurances from an ICC task force that acceptable security arrangements were in place.         
	England, Australia and New Zealand had also expressed their concerns about security after a series of suicide bombings.         
	The ICC executive board will meet again next month to discuss the details of the postponement.         
	The ICC decision came just 19 days before the tournament was to kick-off, which was a very short time for relocating the event to another country.         
	Everyone of our members wishes to ensure the ICC Champions Trophy is a world-class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled, said ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat.         
	The postponement will be a setback for Pakistan, which was keen to host the tournament and had promised to provide a fool-proof security to the teams. We will meet in September and will discuss all the details and we will decide what it looks like in October 2009, Lorgat said.         
	So we were starting to feel uncomfortable that we will not be able to convince all of our member countries and players ... And those concerns would remain and it will not be the right time to stage a world class event, he said.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India welcomed the ICCs decision, saying it agreed with the security concerns raised by other boards.         
	As the decision has been taken by all the members of the ICC, we welcome it. We are not disappointed, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said.         
	We were backing Pakistan but considering the situation we agree with the member boards we, however, continue to support Pakistan, Shah added.

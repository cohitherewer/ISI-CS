                                                   Smith: Hunger is important and you should never be satisfied
  -   South Africas World record holders open up 
        LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                             Graeme Smith      
	Chennai: The record-rewriting Graeme Smith, South Africas highly successful captain, spoke to The Telegraph at the Taj Coromandal on Monday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether hes conscious about rankings         
	I dont aim for a particular ranking, but being ranked (at the top in ODIs, for example) would be seen as an achievement... Often, in South Africa, one ends up worrying so much about the end result... Being No.1, trying to win the World Cup, winning the next series... That one misses the little things in between... Its a cliche, but its about getting the process right... Training well, working on the areas where one needs to improve...         
	His focus         
	On becoming a better cricketer... If I do, then the other things will take care of themselves... Things like rankings, standings... Thats what I believe... Im definitely very proud of what Ive achieved, but remain focused on trying to get better. Id like my team to get better too.         
	Whether hed slept well (in Chittagong) the night he and opening mate Neil McKenzie were just 8 short of equalling the then opening record held by Pankaj Roy-Vinoo Mankad         
	(Laughs) Actually, we didnt know about the 413 record when we came off the field (405 for no loss on the first day of the second Test)... It was later that somebody mentioned it... Thats when I felt some nerves and was quite nervous the next morning! More nervous on 223 than Id ever been in the 90s or the 190s... I mean, if youre so close to a record, then you dont want to miss it...         
	On being the new record-holder         
	Its special for both of us, yes.         
	What if some try to dilute the achievement by saying it came against Bangladesh?         
	No one was sceptical of the earlier record, which came against New Zealand decades ago... Youd probably think it wouldve been nicer had it been against Australia or India or whoever... But the runs came in tough conditions and its not often that so many get scored... Whats more pleasing is that Neil and I have given another world record to South Africa... Mark (Boucher), remember, is the most successful Test keeper... Fantastic, really, for our cricket.         
	Whether theyd set small targets during that incredible 415-run partnership         
	I think, generally, both of us were quite driven... Neil had been out of the game for some time... As for myself, Id been batting well... The thing about batting is that if youre in form, you should make the most... I was focused, I was hungry... We didnt give our wickets away and, in fact, worked together quite well... We come from the same school and, so, are cut from pretty much similar cloth... We help each other out in small little things... Its not so much about individual goals, but where we want to go as a team...         
	When did he and McKenzie actually realise that theyd been collaborating big         
	Well, its not often that you get 405 in a day... I know Ive had some big partnerships with Herschelle Gibbs, but Neil and I chartered new territory... Ive been fortunate in that Ive had good opening partners... Weve complemented each other and thats been an asset for the team... My strength has been their weakness, so to say, and vice-versa... Its important to spend time together (off the field too) and to understand each other.         
	On four scores of 200 or more in Test cricket         
	Getting big ones isnt easy... Opening is one of the toughest roles, more so if youre also the captain... For example, theres just 10 minutes between innings, if youve fielded first, to switch off from the captaincy mode and exclusively get into that of an opener... A lot of things could be going on in your brain in those 10 minutes... Having to face the new ball becomes challenging... Having said that, I quite enjoy taking on the fast bowlers... Of course, if youre out early on a seaming track then, back in the dressing room, youd be wishing you couldve batted in the middle-order that day... Getting through the initial period is crucial, after that its about the game plan you have. (After a pause) Hunger is important and you should never be satisfied with where youve reached.         
	His batting         
	Today, Im more comfortable with everything and allow myself to play with a little more freedom.         
	Finally, the opener he admires         
	Matthew Hayden... He looks to dominate from the first ball and has such an awesome presence... Its great watching such an incredible batter. Its almost as if Hayden bats without fear, but within a very clear game plan. Awesome, as Ive said.

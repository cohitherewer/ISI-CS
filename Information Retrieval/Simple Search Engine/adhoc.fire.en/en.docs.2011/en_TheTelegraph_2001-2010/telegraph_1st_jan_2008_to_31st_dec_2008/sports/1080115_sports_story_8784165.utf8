                                                   Challenger for women

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: The Challenger Trophy returns in February. Though this will be exclusively for women. 
    
	After the huge success of the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy, the BCCI now has planned a similar tournament for the womens cricketers in its bid to boost the womens cricket in India. The move comes especially after the BCCIs merger with the Womens Cricket Association of India (WCAI). 
    
	Induced in 1994-95, the Challenger Trophy is played between three sides made up of 36 top players from the country to showcase the top talent of the country. 
    
	Confirming the initiative, the Boards CAO, Ratnakar Shetty, told The Telegraph: The tournament will be on the same lines that of the mens Challenger Trophy. Well pick top 36 players from the domestic tournaments and will divide them into three teams, though weve not thought about whether the teams would be named as Red, Blue and Green like that of the mens tournament. 
    
	He added that the tournament will be held sometime in February. The details will be finalised in the womens committee meeting in the first week of February. 
    
	The WCAI secretary Shubhangi Kulkarni said: This is one of the best initiative the Board has taken. 
    
	The tournament will be held before Indias campaign in the Asia Cup also involving Sri Lanka, Pakistan and for the first time Bangladesh. India are the three times Asia Cup champions on the trot. 
    
	It was also learnt that the ICC World Twenty20 for women will for the first time be held in England alongside the mens in 2009. The Board is also planning a tour Down Under in November.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin has made the game better: Shoaib
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sachin has made the game better: Shoaib
                      
	Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar said he takes pride in playing against Sachin Tendulkar but does not believe that the champion Indian batsman is hardest to get out.         
	The speedster hailed Tendulkar for eclipsing Brian Laras world record in Test runs but at the same time Shoiab said that the pressure of a million fans scrutinising his every step makes him vulnerable.         
	Congratulations to Sachin for breaking Brian Laras Test record. We are all lucky to have seen him play and some of us even more fortunate to have actually played against him, Shoaib said.         
	I wouldnt say he is the hardest batsman to get out because when he comes to the wicket he carries so much expectation of all the passionate Indian people and is under so much pressure to score runs that he may be nervous early on.         
	When he gets in and is seeing the ball well, then it is the bowler who is in trouble because once set he is extremely tough to remove. Then it becomes probably the greatest challenge you can face as a bowler, he said.         
	Shoaib felt the batting maestro still has enough cricket in him and should continue to serve the game for at least two more years.         
	Sachin has brought charisma and charm into cricket. I cannot say enough of how much of a gentleman he is. We all have to be thankful to him that he is playing this game and making our sport so much better by being there. I believe he will carry on scoring Test runs for at least another two years.         
	He also doubted that Tendulkars record would ever be bettered although he admitted Ricky Pointing had a fair chance.         
	Shoaib also praised Tendulkars other qualities, saying, he is the most humble person and the greatest example of a gentleman in the game. With all the records he has and the talent you would never know because he is always so quiet, modest and humble.         
	Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court Friday reserved its judgement on writ petitions filed by the fast bowler and the Pakistan Cricket Board regarding a ban and fine imposed on him.         
	After both the parties concluded their arguments, the court said it would hold a hearing on November 17 to cross examine the two parties and then deliver its judgement.           (PTI)

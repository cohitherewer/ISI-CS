The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spotlight now shifts to the on-field action
                                                                                                                                                                                           Spotlight now shifts to the on-field action
  - Last Test for Kumble and Sourav in Bangalore 
  -  World record beckons Sachin         INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                            
	Bangalore: There is a whiff of nostalgia in the air. The Australians are trying to inculcate the mind games that have been a part of their strategy in every high profile series. Be it the historic 2001 encounter or the acrimonious duel Down Under earlier this year, off the field showdowns are sure to attract as much attention as on field spats.         
	If mind games are a way of beating the blues, Ricky Ponting didnt wish to waste an opportunity. Facing probably the biggest test of his captaincy with an almost new-look line-up, the Australian captain said that Indias remaining Fab Four would face a pressure of different proportions in this series after Sourav Ganguly made his plans known on Tuesday.         
	What this will probably do is take some of the pressure off Sourav and put it back on some of the other guys in the side, Ponting said on Wednesday.         
	Steve Waugh and Adam Gilchrist had made similar announcements before their home engagements against India. While Australia nearly lost the Test series in 2003-04, they did lose the tri-series in February-March when Gilchrist was given a rousing send off at every venue.         
	Ponting was understandably diplomatic when quizzed if Steves retirement had led to an identical situation. Im not sure if it took our whole focus away when Steve announced that he was going to retire. What it certainly does is creates distractions, was his riposte.         
	Anil Kumble, though, decided to dismiss it with a straight bat. I dont think it is a distraction. It is his (Sourav) personal choice. He has had a fantastic career and I hope that this series would be good for him Not just for him, but Team India as well. That would be the focus because for us the team comes first, and then the individual.         
	In many ways this Border-Gavaskar Trophy has been billed as a battle between the experienced and the relatively inexperienced. If the events over the last few days are any indication, the message to the Fab Four is clear: perform or perish. Sourav may have decided his own fate, but this series is sure to break if not extend a few other careers.         
	Theres no doubt Sourav will be hugely motivated before taking his final bow, and the others will also be eager to put the disappointment of the Sri Lanka tour behind. Dont forget Sachin Tendulkar needs only 76 to equal Brian Laras record of 11953 runs while V. V. S Laxman is four matches away from his 100th Test. For Kumble and Sourav of course, this will be their last Test at Bangalore.         
	For Ponting, its not just the team performance but also his individual form that will attract much attention. His dismal batting record in India notwithstanding, the general feeling is that the Aussies are no more invincible. Not without reason has Ian Chappell opined that this is Indias best chance at humiliating the visitors.         
	If the visitors bowling has the potential to run through a strong Indian line-up twice in a Test will be keenly watched. The fact that none of their spinners have played a Test implies that they will be forced to rely on their pace attack.         
	The Aussies might be prompted to say that pacers won them their last series in India. But that will mean ignoring one vital factor: Shane Warnes intimidating presence at the other end.         
	Ponting is likely to keep faith on finger spinner Jason Krejza ahead of Cameron White. Despite suffering a mauling against Board Presidents XI, Ponting has been impressed with Krejzas attitude and believes hed do a good job if selected for his maiden Test.         
	The wicket at the Chinnaswamy will aid the spinners towards the later stages though its hard look and the overcast conditions are sure to work to the pacers advantage as well.         
	The Indians are planning to keep Amit Mishra and Munaf Patel out of the XIII announced for the match.         
	Pontings assertion that they like in 2004 will again strategically rely heavily on defensive field placings to control the Indians penchant for hitting boundaries may not give them the edge this time. The Indians, as coach Gary Kirsten said, are prepared.         
	I think we obviously have identified that it is something they might look to do. Again we are very aware of what their plans are and we have prepared accordingly, Kirtsen said.         
	We have got a group of very talented batsmen in this team and we are looking for a few of them to get into good form early on in the series and then to run with that. They all have their own game plans and we just throw some ideas in terms of what options they have. As I have said I think the preparations from a batting perspective have been spot on. They are fresh and motivated         
	That the last six decisive Tests between the two countries have been won by the team winning the toss will weigh heavily on the captains minds when they go out on Thursday.

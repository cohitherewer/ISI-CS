	Adelaide: After losing in what was a cordial third Test, Australia would be back to their fiercely competitive and aggressive ways  albeit without crossing the limit  in the fourth and final Test beginning Thursday, opener Phil Jaques has said. 
    
	We would be fiercely competitive and as aggressive as possible. We will approach it as always To play hard. We would be aggressive without crossing the line, he said. 
    
	Jaques, done in by left-arm swing bowler Irfan Pathan in both the innings in Perth, said he wanted to get him in the next match. 
    
	He bowled really tight lines (in Perth). He bowled a couple of good balls. That happens in cricket Hopefully I can get him next time, Jaques said. 
    
	The Australian opener said Matthew Haydens return would make a lot of difference. 
    
	Matt (Hayden) coming back into the side will make a difference to our team and give us a whole lot of confidence. Hes a fine player with a fine record. 
    
	Hes fantastic Has a wealth of knowledge. My mindset did not change too much not having Matt there but having him there will give the side what we need at the top of the order, he said. 
    
	So far, in his short career, Jaques has had a good standing going with Hayden.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coach Roy blames it on complacency
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Coach Roy blames it on complacency
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Srinagar: Two of the leading footballers of the Eighties were dejected men at the Bakshi Stadium on Tuesday. While Bengal coach Krishnendu Roy was clearly unhappy over the performance of his boys against Maharashtra, his Goa counterpart, Mauricio Afonso, was furious.         
	Afonso, a former India captain, found it hard to accept Goas exit from the Santosh Trophy at the quarter final stage. I asked them to be more careful he said.         
	Roy admitted that his boys were complacent. After the Goa-Karnataka match, we knew that even a 0-2 defeat would take us to the semi-finals. It did cost us two points.         
	I told the boys in the dressing room that we should be careful but nothing happened. I hope this result will come as a wake up call to the team.

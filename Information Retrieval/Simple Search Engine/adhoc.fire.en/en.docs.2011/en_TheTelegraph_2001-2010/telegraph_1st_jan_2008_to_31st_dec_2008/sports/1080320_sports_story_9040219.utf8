The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Charlesworth impasse continues
                                                   Charlesworth impasse continues
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The senior officials of the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), who met here on Wednesday, failed to arrive at a consensus about Ric Charlesworths role in the senior national team.         
	According to IHF sources, though most of the members were in favour of handing over the senior teams charge to Charlesworth, federation president K.P.S. Gill remained unconvinced. A meeting will be held on Thursday again.         
	While several members urged that the Australian be made technical director of the senior team, Gill was still rooting for Joaquim Carvalho at least for the time being, sources said.         
	 There was almost a consensus on Charlesworth, but Gill said that the proposal tabled by the Aussie was too expensive, sources revealed.         
	Even some of the ministry officials are apprehensive, since the four-time Olympian would have to be paid a huge salary of Rs 6 lakh per month.         
	Charlesworth was called in for a meeting in the afternoon at Gills residence. The Aussie looked dejected after the three-hour meeting and refused to comment.         
	Charlesworth is believed to have told the IHF officials that there has to be a proper planning in place to improve the game in the country.         
	Nothing is possible without a long-term plan. The national teams performance can be improved within this infrastructure also, he reportedly said at the meeting.         
	When contacted in Mumbai Carvalho said: I know nothing about what is happening there. I will accept any decision that is good for Indian hockey.

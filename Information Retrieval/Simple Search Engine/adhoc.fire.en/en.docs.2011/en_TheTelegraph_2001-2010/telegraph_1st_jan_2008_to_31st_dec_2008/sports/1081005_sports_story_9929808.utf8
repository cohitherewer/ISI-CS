	New Delhi: India found South Korea too hot to handle and went down 2-5 in the first group B match of the Asian under-16 championships at Tashkent on Saturday.         
	India conceded the first goal in the very third minute but did well to keep the former champions at bay for the rest of the first session.         
	In the second half, the Koreans struck four times through Rim Chang Wo, Lee Chang (2) and Son Heung Min. In between, Lalrindika scored twice for the Indians through free-kicks from outside the penalty box.         
	India, who were without their injured striker Malsawmfelea, wasted two chances in the first half.         
	In the 27th minute, forward Abhishek Das managed to beat the Korean goalkeeper but his shot went off the target.         
	Eight minutes later, Lalrindika sent the ball at the goalmouth but Tirthankar Sarkar headed it over the crosspiece.         
	India now play Syria on Monday, followed by the concluding group tie against Indonesia on Wednesday.         
	Two teams qualify from the four-team group.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev takes leaf out of Faldo book
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeev takes leaf out of Faldo book
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Jeev Milkha Singh with the Austrian Open trophy on Sunday. (AFP)                                 
	Vienna: Indias Jeev Milkha Singh took a leaf out of Nick Faldos Open-winning book when 18 pars in the final round at Fontana were enough to earn him the Austrian Open title on Sunday.         
	Faldo ran in 18 successive pars in Muirfield in 1987 to claim his first major (British Open) title and Jeev repeated the feat for a round of 71 and a three-round total of 15-under-par 198, to hold off Englishman Simon Wakefield by a stroke.         
	I had no idea about Nick Faldo and I was trying to make birdies but they just wouldnt go in, the winner said.         
	When you have a lead you dont want to be too aggressive or too defensive, you just play mediocre golf and hit fairways and greens.         
	It was a third European Tour victory, following his 2006 Volvo Masters and Volvo China Open wins, and 170,000 for Jeev.         
	Wakefield, Jeevs nearest challenger overnight, began the final round four off the lead in the tournament reduced to 54 holes because of Thursdays washout.         
	The Englishman exerted pressure on playing-partner Jeev by making birdies on three of the last four holes but came up a stroke shy of forcing a play-off.         
	I feel very fortunate to win with 18 pars, he said. Shooting even par on the last day its tough to win and Simon put up a great fight. I think the golfing gods were looking out for me. They did not want a play-off with the bad weather forecast! Jeev said.         
	Sundays triumph also pushed him up to ninth place on the European Tour Order of Merit with euro731,692.         
	The Indian said he was elated to have ended the title drought.         
	Its great to win, its always a feather in your cap. Ive knocked on the door a few times this season and at last the door has opened for me. Im pretty excited about that, he said.

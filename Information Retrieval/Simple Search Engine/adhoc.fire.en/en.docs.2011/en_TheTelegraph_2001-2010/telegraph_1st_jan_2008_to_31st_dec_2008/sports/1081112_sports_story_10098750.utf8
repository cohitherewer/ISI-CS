                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bengal let MP off the hook
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Madhya Pradesh need 33 more runs to overtake Bengals first innings total of 210 at the end of the second day of their Ranji Trophy plate group match at Gwalior on Tuesday.         
	At the end of days play, Madhya Pradesh reached 178 for the loss of five wickets.         
	According to reports received here, Madhya Pradesh were reeling at the start of their innings.         
	They had lost their first three wickets for only five runs and were even reduced to 63 for five.         
	But Hrishikesh Kanitkar stood firm and played a captains knock to deny Bengal.         
	The former India player was unbeaten on 76 and keeping him company was BR Tomar on 51 when stumps were drawn.         
	Kanitkar and Tomar have already added 115 runs for the sixth wicket.         
	Bengal would need to break the partnership early on Wednesday if they are to harbour any hopes of survival in the match.         
	Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla missed a vital catch, putting down Kanitkar, when he was on six.         
	Ashok Dinda, who was recently part of the India A squad, scalped three wickets while Ranadeb Bose picked up one.         
	Bengal players will need to improve their performance drastically on the third day if they are to harbour hopes of returning to the elite division.

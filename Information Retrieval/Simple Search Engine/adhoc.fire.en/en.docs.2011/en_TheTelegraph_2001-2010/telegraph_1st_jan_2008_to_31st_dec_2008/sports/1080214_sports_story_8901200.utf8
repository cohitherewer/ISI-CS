                                                   Md. Sporting, Peerless tie to be replayed 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The IFA on Wednesday decided to have the Mohammedan Sporting versus Peerless SC clash in the Prodyut Dutta memorial tournament replayed after the original tie on Saturday was suspended following crowd violation and assault on referee Prabir Dhar at the Mohammedan Sporting ground.         
	Mohammedan Sporting officials apologised and pointed out that there was inadequate security at the ground during the match. We have accepted their gesture and the match will now be replayed, IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly said after a meeting with both club officials on Wednesday.         
	The date and venue of the match have not been announced.         
	Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan will miss P.C. Lalawmpuia in their penultimate ONGC I-League match against JCT in Ludhiana on February 22. Although the forward injured himself during practice on Wednesday, some club sources revealed that the player was disciplined for attending the training session in inebriated condition.         
	Mohun Bagan will leave for Ludhiana on Thursday morning also without injured medio Douglas Da Silva (ankle) and N. Mohan Raj (hamstring).

	New Delhi: Koneru Humpy, worlds top-ranking grandmaster behind Judith Polgar in womens category, has decided to give the chess Olympiad a miss to be staged this November in Dresden (Germany), despite being given her maiden opportunity to p3lay for the mens team.         
	The 21-year-old player, who had been spearheading the Indian challenge in womens section, was keen to represent the country in the open section, but when selected to be a part of the mens team this year, she preferred to play in her promised Fide events and earn some Elo rating points.         
	It was a difficult choice but Ill have to skip it. I had already confirmed some competition in Europe  European Club Cup in Greece and Cap de Agde in France  eight months before. Dates of these tournaments have now been postponed to late October and the Olympiad is in November, Humpy said.         
	The youngest woman ever to become a grandmaster by beating Polgars record by 3 months, Humpys rating have been on the rise and she was selected to play in the mens team in Olympiad for being among the top-five GMs of the country.

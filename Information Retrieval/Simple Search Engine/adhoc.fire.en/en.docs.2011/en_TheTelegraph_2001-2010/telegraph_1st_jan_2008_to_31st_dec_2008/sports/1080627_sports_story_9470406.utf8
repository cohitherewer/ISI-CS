The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Turks depart proud losers
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Turks depart proud losers
                      
	Basel: Turkey won many fans at Euro 2008 and showed they can become a major force in world soccer thanks to their determination, skill and grace.         
	Coach Fatih Terim, who said he would probably quit following Wednesdays agonising 2-3 defeat by Germany in the semi-final, deserves huge credit for the way he has handled himself.         
	Injuries and suspensions tore the heart out of his team with goalkeeper Volkan Demirel banned for Wednesday and striker Nihat Kahveci ruled out alongside midfielder Emre Belozoglu.         
	Three more suspensions and a host of other injuries made Terims starting line-up almost pick itself yet the Turks still dominated the Germans for half the game and can count themselves unlucky to lose to a last-minute winner by Philipp Lahm.         
	There were no sour grapes from Terim, though.         
	We are leaving as one of the most colourful teams here. We were almost there but this is football. We respect our opponents. I am very, very proud of my team, he said.         
	Creative midfielder Hamit Altintop plays for Bayern Munich and was well known to the Germans but they still struggled to stop him controlling the game with his neat passing.

	London: Arsenal strode into the New Year with their lead at the top of the Premier League intact after a comfortable 2-0 victory over London rivals West Ham United on Tuesday. 
    
	Early goals from strikers Eduardo and Emmanuel Adebayor did the damage at the Emirates as Arsenal completed the double over a side that beat them home and away last season. 
    
	Manchester United, who lost top spot on Saturday after a surprise 1-2 loss at West Ham, kept close on the tail of the Gunners thanks to a Carlos Tevez goal in an nervy 1-0 defeat of Birmingham City at Old Trafford. 
    
	Arsenal have 50 points from 21 games, two points more than Manchester United, while Chelsea have 44 are after coming from behind to beat Fulham 2-1 in a lunchtime kick-off with goals from Salomon Kalou and Michael Ballack. 
    
	Everton moved up to fifth after a 2-0 victory at Middlesbrough while Portsmouth are sixth following a 2-0 win at Reading, who played virtually the entire match with 10 men after Ibrahima Sonko was sent off in the fourth minute. 
    
	Aston Villa were at home to Tottenham Hotspur later while fourth-placed Liverpool are not in action until Wednesday when they welcome struggling Wigan Athletic at Anfield. 
    
	West Ham have a knack of springing surprise results against title chasing sides and are still the only visiting team to win a Premier League match at the Emirates but on Tuesday they were left with an impossible task. 
    
	Arsenal needed less than two minutes to take the lead when Eduardo pounced with a sharp finish to follow his double in the 4-1 defeat of Everton on Saturday. 
    
	Chelsea overcame the absence of a host of big names to win the west London derby against a Fulham side who were under the charge of new manager Roy Hodgson for the first time. 
    
	Danny Murphy gave second-from-bottom Fulham a 10th-minute lead from the penalty spot after Moritz Volz was tripped by Joe Cole and they were comfortable until the break. (Reuters)

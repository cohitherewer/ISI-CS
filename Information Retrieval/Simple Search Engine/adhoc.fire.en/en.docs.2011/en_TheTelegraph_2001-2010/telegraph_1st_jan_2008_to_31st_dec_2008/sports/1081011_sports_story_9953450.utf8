The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | This hundred is special: Hussey
                                                                                                                                                                                             This hundred is special: Hussey
    - First test indian openers provide a good start             OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mike Hussey celebrates after reaching his century on Day II of the first Test in Bangalore on Friday                                 
	Bangalore: Michael Hussey thinks his ninth Test hundred was very rewarding since India is arguably the toughest place to bat for an Australian. At the press conference he also hoped their bowlers would now be able to utilise the conditions.               
	The following are excerpts:               
	The pitch and the conditions         
	I think at different stages, it was very difficult. The new ball is coming on to the bat so it is little bit easier to score. As the ball gets softer and starts reverse swinging it is a different challenge again.         
	Greg Chappells role         
	Hes been a great help, most definitely. For the batsmen he has been an invaluable resource.         
	Anything specific from Chappell         
	More on the mental approach of the game, just keeping it simple and not trying to clog my mind too much. Just going out there and playing my game, that has been his message.         
	Where he ranks this hundred         
	It is particularly special to get a Test match hundred in India, which is arguably the toughest place for an Australian.         
	On the overflowing emotions (punching the air) on reaching his century         
	I was relieved to start with. It was just pure excitement that was coming out. It was a lot of hard work. It was just a bit of relief         
	His near 70 average in Tests         
	Luck... You need luck along the way. It took me a long time to get into the Australian team, so I just want to take every opportunity that I get and never take it for granted. Like all the guys in the dressing room I wear the baggy green cap with a lot of pride. .         
	His thoughts on Sachin Tendulkar getting past Brian Lara in this series         
	It will be a wonderful achievement. I played in a Test match when Brian Lara broke Allan Borders record so it is not going to be a nice feeling if he gets past against us again.

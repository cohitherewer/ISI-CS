The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jankovic, Kuznetsova shown the door
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jankovic, Kuznetsova shown the door
  - Dubious record marks first day of second week Federer makes short work of Hewitt             Jelena Jankovic after her defeat on Monday                           
	Wimbledon: Second-seeded Jelena Jankovic and No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetsova were ousted in the fourth round on Monday, leaving Wimbledon without any of the top four women in the quarter finals for the first time ever.         
	A hobbled Jankovic fell 3-6, 2-6 to Tamarine Tanasugarn, while 2004 US Open champion Kuznetsova lost 4-6, 6-1, 5-7 to 19-year-old Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland. With top-seeded Ana Ivanovic and No. 3 Maria Sharapova eliminated last week, none of the top four women reached the quarter finals  the first time thats happened at Wimbledon and also the first time at any Grand Slam tournament in the 40-year history of the Open era.         
	The highest seeded player left is No. 5 Elena Dementieva, who cruised to a 6-2, 6-1 win over Shahar Peer.         
	The Williams sisters, meanwhile, moved closer to another Wimbledon final with back-to-back victories on Court 2  nicknamed the Graveyard of Champions for its history of upsets. They questioned why they werent put on Centre Court or Court 1.         
	Defending champion Venus Williams beat Russian teenager Alisa Kleybanova 6-3, 6-4, while two-time winner Serena downed Bethanie Mattek  the only other American left in the mens or womens draw  6-3, 6-3.         
	It wasnt what I would have liked to see, Serena Williams said of the Court 2 scheduling. Initially, I thought, Is this the right schedule? I thought maybe there was a mistake. But I cant dwell on that. I just have to focus on doing the best that I can whether Im on Court 2 or Court 20.         
	In mens play, five-time champion Roger Federer swept Lleyton Hewitt  the last man to win the title before him  7-6 (9-7), 6-2, 6-4 on Centre Court to extend his winning streak on grass to 63 matches and 38 in a row at the All England Club. Federer, who served 21 aces, has now beaten his Australian rival in 12 consecutive matches.         
	Federer will next face the last player to beat him on grass and at Wimbledon  Croatian Mario Ancic, who won in the first round in 2002. Ancic came from two sets down Monday to beat Fernando Verdasco 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 13-11. The final set alone lasted 1 hour, 35 minutes.         
	I completely underestimated him back in 2002, Federer said. I was a little shell-shocked and didnt know what happened to me. What it taught me was not to underestimate any opponent.         
	No. 2-ranked Rafael Nadal, runner-up to Federer the last two years, overcame an injury scare in the second game of the match and beat Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.         
	Nadal slipped on the worn turf behind the baseline on Court 1 while stretching to hit a forehand, with his right leg bending awkwardly. After losing the point, he took a medical timeout, and a trainer wrapped his leg below the knee. The Spaniard lost the next point and the game, but showed no sign of trouble and dominated the rest of the way.         
	I feel something behind the knee, but it seems better, the four-time French Open champion said. Im going to get it checked for a precaution but I hope that Im fine. Playing with her left knee heavily strapped, Jankovic was never in serious contention against the 60th-ranked Tanasugarn.         
	The 31-year-old Thai, playing in her 12th consecutive Wimbledon, also was treated for a lower back problem during changeovers in the second set.         
	After converting on match point to reach the quarter finals of a Grand Slam for the first time, Tanasugarn covered her face with her hands and broke into tears.         
	Venus Williams, a four-time Wimbledon winner, nearly squandered a 5-1 lead in the second set against the 18-year-old Kleybanova. She lost nine points in a row from her third match point in the eighth game and saved three break points at 5-4 before finally closing it with a backhand volley winner.         
	Serena Williams wobbled slightly after going up 3-0 in the second set as Mattek raised her game by playing serve-and-volley.         
	Williams received a warning for an audible obscenity in the fifth game, but that didnt stop her as she won the next five points. She finished the match with a backhand drop volley into the open court.         
	Venus Williams, who will face Tanasugarn in the quarters, was clearly not happy with the court scheduling. Theres not too much Im going to say about that in the press, she said.         
	No. 10-seeded Marcos Baghdatis, a semi-finalist in 2006 and quarter finalist last year, squandered three match points in the fifth set. The Cypriot lost 7-5, 2-6, 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-8 to Feliciano Lopez. The Spaniard, down 0-40 at 4-5, came up with big serves on all three points to avoid defeat.

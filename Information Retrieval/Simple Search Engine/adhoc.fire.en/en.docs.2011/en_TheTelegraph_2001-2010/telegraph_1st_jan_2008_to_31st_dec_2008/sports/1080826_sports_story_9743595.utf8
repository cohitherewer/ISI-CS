                                                                                                                                                                                           Vijai Singh wins title in play-off
                      
	New Jersey: Vijai Singh won The Barclays for a record fourth time by beating Sergio Garcia on the second playoff hole on Sunday.         
	Singh closed with a 1-under 70 to match Garcia (70) and Kevin Sutherland (68) at 8-under 276 on the sun-baked Ridgewood Country Club course, the first-time site after 41 seasons at Westchester Country Club.         
	 Its a great golf course, said Singh, the 1993, 1995 and 2006 winner at Westchester. Westchester was a good golf course. This tops Westchester. Every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course. Singh earned 11,000 points in the U.S. PGA Tour playoff opener to take the lead with 109,500 points.

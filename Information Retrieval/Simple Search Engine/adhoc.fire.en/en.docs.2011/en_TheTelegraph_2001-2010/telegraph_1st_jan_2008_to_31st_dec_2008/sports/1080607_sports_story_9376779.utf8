	Srinagar: Having already booked a place in the semi-finals, chief coach Bob Houghton is likely to rest most of his first team players when India take on Maldives in a group league match of the SAFF Cup in Male on Saturday.         
	According to information received here, Subrata Pal will make way for Subhasis Roy Chowdhury in goal while JCT defender Anwar Ali is likely to come in for stopper Mahesh Gawli. In midfield, Houghton is expected to rest Steven Dias, Climax Lawrence and NP Pradeep, paving the way for Bungo Singh, Sampat Kuttimani and Mehrajuddin Wadoo.         
	Bhaichung Bhutia and Sunil Chettri will also warm the bench.

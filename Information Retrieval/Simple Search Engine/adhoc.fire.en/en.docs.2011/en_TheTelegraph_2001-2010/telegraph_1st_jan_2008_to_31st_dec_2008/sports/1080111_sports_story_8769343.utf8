                                                    Sydney Test was Oval revisited

	For me the Sydney Test between India and Australia was like dj vu. It was the Oval Test of 2006 revisited for me. The same umpiring mistakes and the failure of a Match Referee to act in a timely and sensible manner created another explosive situation. A crisis that has done nothing to improve the image of the sport or relations among cricket-playing nations. 
    
	It is ironic and telling that Mike Procter was also the Match Referee for the Oval Test and I remember how frustrating it was seeing him unable to handle things. I saw a streak of stubbornness in him and the saddest part was that he just allowed things to spiral out of control. What hurts is that nothing has changed since then and again we have a crisis with the Sydney Test. 
    
	I think Match Referees and umpires do need to understand that when a team is done in by some apparently glaring umpiring mistakes they need to be shown some sympathy. 
    
	In Sydney I think what really upset the Indians was that after suffering from some poor decisions, Procter decided to slap the serious charge of racism on Harbhajan Singh. 
    
	We have played a lot against Harbhajan and he is quite a friendly guy. Apart from the expected aggression on the field, he mingled well with our players. I dont consider him racist by any stretch of imagination and I dont think what he said in the heat of the moment would have had any real meaning to it. 
    
	And one has to see the incident in the context of the strained on-field relationship the Indians and Australians have been having for some time now. Any sensible Match Referee would have done that. 
    
	The bottomline is that Procter took a holier than thou stance while punishing Harbhajan, but what about the umpires? Why were they not made accountable? Why shouldnt umpires be replaced during a match if they dont perform up to expectations? Players are penalised or suspended almost immediately for any offence. Why not umpires and referees?

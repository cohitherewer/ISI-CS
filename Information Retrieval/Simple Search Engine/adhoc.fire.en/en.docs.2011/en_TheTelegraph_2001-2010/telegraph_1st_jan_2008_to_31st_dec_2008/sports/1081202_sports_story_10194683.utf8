                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chennai, Mohali to host Tests
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Monday announced a revised itinerary for Englands tour of India, with Chennai and Mohali as the two Test venues.         
	While the BCCI is hoping that England will return for the Test series, the ECB has not taken a decision yet.         
	The ECB will be sending their security consultant Reg Dickason for an on the spot assessment before a final clearance is given for the tour.         
	The Telegraph it may be recalled had reported on Monday that England had very strong reservations about playing the first Test in Ahmedabad and the three-day match in Vadodara.         
	The BCCI, in a bid to salvage the tour, agreed to their demands. As per the revised schedule, Chennai will host the first Test from December 11 to 15 while the second Test will be played in Mohali from December 19 to 23. The three-day tour match has been scrapped.         
	The revised itinerary might go some way towards calming Englands fears.         
	The original venue for the first Test was Ahmedabad, which was ruled out both because of its proximity to Mumbai, and because it was the scene of serial bomb blasts three months ago.         
	BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan said in a media release: ECB has informed BCCI that England are agreeable to tour India and play two Tests, the first in Chennai from December 11-15 and the second in Mohali from December 19 to 23.         
	ECB will be sending their security consultant for discussions with the authorities in India before final clearance is given for the tour.         
	Kevin Pietersen and Co. returned home late on Saturday after the last two ODIs of the seven-match series was called off following the terror strikes in Mumbai. Mahendra Singh Dhonis side won the truncated series 5-0.         
	Both Chennai and Mohali would thus be hosting their second Test matches in a calendar year following the rescheduling of the matches against England.         
	The ECB has maintained that it was for the players to decide whether they want to return to India but they would be briefed in detail about the security scenario and the arrangements that would be in place for the tour.

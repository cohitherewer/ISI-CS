The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jaipur fined for spending less 
                                                   Jaipur fined for spending less 
                      
	New Delhi: The Jaipur franchise has been penalised for spending less amount than the mandatory sum set by the Indian Premier League organisers at the players auction in Mumbai.         
	The Jaipur team was required to spend $3.3 million (Rs 13.17 crore approx.) but they ended up shelling out only $2.9 million (Rs 11.8 crore approx.) for eight players.         
	The Jaipur team has been penalised for spending less than the mandatory amount in yesterdays players auction, IPL chairman Lalit Modi said.         
	In penalty, they will have to pay the difference to the organisers, he said.         
	Five of the eight franchises, however, spent more than the maximum limit of $5 million. As per the IPL rules, if a player is expected to be either completely unavailable or only available for less than four of the matches in 2008, 25 per cent of the fee bid for that player in the auction will count against the $5 million purse.         
	Jaipur have bought Mohammad Kaif (Rs 2.7 crore), Graeme Smith (Rs 1.9 crore), Yousuf Pathan (Rs 1.9 crore), Shane Warne (Rs 1.7 crore), Munaf Patel (Rs 1.1 crore), Younis Khan (Rs 90 lakh), Kamran Akmal (Rs 60 lakh) and Justin Langer (Rs 80 lakh).

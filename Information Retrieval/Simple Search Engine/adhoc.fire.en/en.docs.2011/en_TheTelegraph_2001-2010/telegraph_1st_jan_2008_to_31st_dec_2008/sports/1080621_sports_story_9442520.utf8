The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev tied 31st 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev tied 31st 
                      
	Munich: Jeev Milkha Singh survived a wretched four-hole stretch in his wobbly back nine to bring home a card of two-under 70 that had the highest ranked Indian golfer tied 31st after the opening round of the BMW International Open here.         
	Compatriots Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur turned in identical cards of one-under 71 to share the 48th place.         
	On a high after his Bank Austria triumph in Vienna earlier this month, Jeev began in the right earnest and was in fact three-under when he ran into a bumpy stretch.         
	Bogeys on the 13th, 14th and 16th holes undid all the good work but Jeev showed tremendous resilience and signed off with an impeccable birdie-birdie finish to salvage his card.         
	Randhawa, too, looked in trouble and was one-over after 14 holes before the lanky pro birdied the 15th and picked up one more shot on the final hole to return a sub-par card.         
	Shiv Kapur, meanwhile, had a decent start and playing his back nine first, the Delhi pro kept it bogey free, while sinking birdies on the 14th and 18th. In his eventful front nine, Shiv dropped three bogeys against two birdies to settle for a card of 71. At the top, Asian Tour regular Mardan Mamat of Singapore blasted six-under 66 to join Argentine Rafa Echenique (PTI)

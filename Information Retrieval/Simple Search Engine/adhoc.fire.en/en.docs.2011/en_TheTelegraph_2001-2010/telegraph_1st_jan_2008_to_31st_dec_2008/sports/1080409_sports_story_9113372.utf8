The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin didnt call up IOA, says Anjali
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sachin didnt call up IOA, says Anjali
  - Olympic Torch Relay 
  -  Kalmadi gets it all wrong         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Calcutta: Its the Suresh Kalmadi-headed Indian Olympic Association (IOA) which approached the talismanic Sachin Tendulkar to carry the Olympic torch, which is at the centre of a raging controversy, not the other way round.         
	Its around three weeks ago that the IOA sent a letter to Sachin, asking if hed be available to carry the torch in New Delhi on April 17. Sachin was then in Chennai, preparing for the first Test (against South Africa)         
	Sachin thought about it on coming back to Mumbai and it was last Friday, I think, that his secretary (Florence) called up Mr Kalmadis office and conveyed that hed be available At no time did Sachin either volunteer or personally telephone anybody, wife Anjali told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Sachin was undergoing treatment for a groin strain (which has already kept him off cricket for well over a week) when one got through to his Bandra residence.         
	While Anjali didnt exactly say that Sachins upset, somebody else quite close to Indias No.1 sports superstar indicated as much.         
	The IOA has made it appear that Sachins desperate to carry the torch Thats just not done and the IOA hasnt at all been fair to him, the person pointed out.         
	Kalmadi had, on Monday, said: Its a matter of great pride that the torch would pass through India. There is a big rush among the sportspersons to be part of it (the torch relay). Sachin Tendulkar called up this morning and asked if we would like him to carry the torch         
	Clearly, Kalmadi got it all very wrong and Sachin isnt amused.         
	Indias soccer captain Bhaichung Bhutia, it may be recalled, has (for personal reasons) declined to carry the torch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettori speaks out against tie-breakers
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Vettori speaks out against tie-breakers
                      
	Hamilton: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori wants tie-breakers banished from Twenty20 cricket after his side were belted into submission by the West Indies in their opening limited-over international.         
	Whats wrong with a tie, I have no issues with it, Vettori said Saturday, on the eve of the second and final Twenty20 match between New Zealand and the West Indies in Hamilton.         
	When the first match in Auckland Friday ended in a tie at 155-all the teams were forced to play a one-over eliminator involving three batsmen and one bowler to decide the winner.         
	West Indies captain Chris Gayle belted Vettori for 25, including three sixes, in his over while New Zealand were out for 15 after four balls.         
	The only previous Twenty20 clash between the two teams in 2006 also ended in a tie and was won by New Zealand after a bowl-out where bowlers needed to hit unguarded stumps. But, Vettori did not believe it was necessary to break a deadlock in an international.         
	I think a ties a tie, he said. I understand the appeal of it (an eliminator). I suppose if youre sitting on the other side of a win you might enjoy it. (But) The games called Twenty20, its not called One1. We dont want to dilute it too much.         
	Gayle, who quipped after the first match that it was a good one-over game, again threatens to be the central figure in the second encounter. (AFP)

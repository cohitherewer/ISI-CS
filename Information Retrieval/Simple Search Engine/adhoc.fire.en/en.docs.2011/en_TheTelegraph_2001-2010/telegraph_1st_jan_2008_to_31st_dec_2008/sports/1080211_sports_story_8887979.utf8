                                                  Success will inspire those with big dreams, feels Kapil Dev
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kapil Dev                           
	Calcutta: The unassuming Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia, not yet 30, collected his biggest cheque ($416,660) on Sunday.         
	However, according to Kapil Dev, inarguably Indias most high profile cricketer-turned-golfer, Chowrasia left the Delhi Golf Club (DGC) with something even richer  oodles of confidence.         
	Its a fantastic achievement Chowrasia needed a bit of confidence to move up and the Indian Masters win should do wonders as he prepares for bigger challenges. Generally, our golfers have never lacked ability, but needed more confidence, is how Kapil saluted the Calcuttans mind-blowing triumph.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from Mumbai, Kapil added: Usually, caddies who turn pros are shy and do take time to settle down on the circuit In fact, Chowrasia once lost out because he didnt sign his card All that will change now         
	Ive admired Chowrasias determination and his success should serve as an example for those with big dreams Ive practised with him a few times and have liked the manner in which he keeps a low profile         
	Asked if he was surprised that world No. 4 Ernie Els did no better than finish joint sixth, Kapil replied: Not really Id, of course, expected big things from Jyoti Randhawa (joint 22nd) He had a seven-under one day and, I think, eight-over the next In the big tournaments its all about holding nerve and that comes with confidence.         
	Kapil pointed out that the DGC course is unique and that the wind wouldve made it very challenging.         
	Believe me, no matter what some may say, it couldnt have been easy after the wind picked up So, because of the conditions, more credit to Chowrasia His win has gladdened us         
	Victories at the MCG and in the Davis Cup Plus Chowrasias stunning performance Sunday couldnt have got better.

  - Rains threaten to play spoilsport in first Test       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                            
	Chennai: As England began preparations for the start of the series at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Tuesday, Alastair Cook admitted the disrupted warm-up programme could bond the team together.         
	The Essex left-hander famously scored an unbeaten century on his Test debut in Nagpur, having been flown out from the A tour in West Indies two years ago following an injury to then captain Michael Vaughan.         
	His success in similarly disrupted circumstances has given England hope they can defy expectations and compete against an India side who beat Australia only last month.         
	What has happened recently has been taken out of our control but this side has got behind each other and made some tough decisions, he continued.         
	Were here as a unit now and we have to play some cricket. The preparation isnt ideal but I came here two years ago, flying half way around the world and had one training session and then played so it can be done  you dont just suddenly lose your technique overnight.         
	I remember turning up for my first Test match and jet lag doesnt really affect you when youve got adrenaline kicking through your body.         
	You can use any excuse about the preparation but I turned up last time having travelled all the way around the world and luckily I performed well on that day. It proves if youre mentally switched on you can achieve things and thats what we need to do as a side now.         
	As England practised at the stadium, the ever-present security was evident with the Rapid Action Force guarding the outfield at all times.         
	But when the steady rain that ruined Indias session earlier in the day finally ceased, England were able to return to playing cricket again with Ian Bell and Andrew Strauss the first in the nets to begin Englands Test preparations.         
	First and foremost we are cricketers and we just want to play cricket, said Cook. It will be great to get back to something we know and something we know more about rather than talking about stuff we dont really know about.         
	Abu Dhabi was brilliant in terms of training but we still had that overlying thought of what the security report would say.         
	Now it has come back and said it is safe were very excited about playing cricket and not worrying about other stuff we dont really know about.         
	The meteorological office, meanwhile, said that one or two spells of rain was supposed to lash the city in the next 48 hours.         
	For the next 48 hours, there would be one or two spells of rain and cloudy weather conditions would prevail due to activity of the North East monsoon over Tamil Nadu, a spokesman said.         
	There is no alert of low pressure or depression in the Bay of Bengal. This is only a normal monsoon activity. Gradual reduction of rainfall was expected from Thursday, the day the first Test begins.         
	The city has been experiencing intermittent rain forcing the Indian team to abandon their practice session, which was delayed from morning to the afternoon.         
	The Indians, who were scheduled to have their practice from 10.00 am rescheduled their plan to 12.30 pm this afternoon. That, however, didnt help them.         
	Refusing to restrict themselves to the confines of their hotel rooms despite threats, the Indian team went out for a movie at a city theatre in the evening.         
	Almost the entire team went out to watch the Abhishek Bachchan-John Abraham starrer romantic comedy Dostana.         
	All the team members wanted to go. Security was provided to them with pilot cars and commandos, joint commissioner of police P. Balasubramanium said.         
	Both the Indian and England cricket teams have been given a tight security in view of the Mumbai terror strikes. The Englishmen, who abandoned the last two matches of the one-day series after the Mumbai mayhem, have been advised to stay indoors.

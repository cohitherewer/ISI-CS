	London: New Zealand stole a dramatic win through an overthrow off the final ball in the fourth one-day International against England at The Oval on Wednesday to take an unbeatable 2-1 lead in the five-match series.         
	With two runs needed off the final ball, Mark Gillespie took a single and the match was won when the return missed the stumps. England had appeared to have won after Grant Elliott was run out for 24 after colliding with Ryan Sidebottom.

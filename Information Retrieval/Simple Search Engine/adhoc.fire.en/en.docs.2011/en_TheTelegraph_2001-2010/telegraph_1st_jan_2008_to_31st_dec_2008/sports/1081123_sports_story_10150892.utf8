	Panaji: Sporting Clube de Goa would be aiming to consolidate their position at the top when they meet Air India Sunday at the Nehru stadium in Margao.         
	Sporting head the table with 19 points from 9 matches and Air India are close behind on 16 points from as many matches.         
	Sporting coach Vishwas Gaonkar is confident of a victory.         
	A win tomorrow (Sunday) will help Sporting to maintain the top spot before they play JCT in the eleventh round to finish the first leg engagement on a happy note, he said.         
	Medios Wilton Gomes and Joseph Pereira are back in the side from injury, it will strengthen the midfield which needs to play the dominant role to arrest the rival set piece moves from the flanks, he said.         
	On the other hand, Air India, who are three points behind Sporting, will be looking to exploit the shaky defence with swift counter moves. A win Sunday will help them pull level with Sporting Clube de Goa at the top.         
	Sundays game is important and a win will give us a good chance to finish at the top of the table, Air India coach Bimal Ghosh said. (PTI)

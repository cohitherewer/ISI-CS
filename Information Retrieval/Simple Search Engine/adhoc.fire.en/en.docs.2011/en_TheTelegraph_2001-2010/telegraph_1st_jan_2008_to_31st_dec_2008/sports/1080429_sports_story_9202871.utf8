The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji saved by Anil in Kanpur
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bhajji saved by Anil in Kanpur
            LOKENDRAPRATAP SAHI            Ashwell Prince                           
	Calcutta: The exact language couldnt be confirmed, but Harbhajan Singh said something very offensive to South Africas vice-captain, Ashwell Prince, during the series-equalling third and final Test in Kanpur earlier this month.         
	The South Africans, though, didnt lodge a complaint following a request from regular Team India Test captain Anil Kumble.         
	Kumble, mind you, didnt play that match and Mahendra Singh Dhoni made his debut as a (stand-in) Test captain.         
	We couldve had a repeat of the Harbhajan-Andrew Symonds controversy, but the South Africans respected Kumbles request and that incident didnt snowball into something big, somebody very senior in the Board of Control for Cricket in India told The Telegraph on Monday evening.         
	The incident was confirmed by a member of the touring party.         
	Yes, Prince found Harbhajans conduct to be very offensive, but the team management decided not to pursue the matter However, Im not sure of what happened behind closed doors, the gentleman said from South Africa.         
	Its unclear whether Harbhajan, Man-of-the-Series then, is aware of the good deed done by Kumble.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke wants to win it for Adam
                                                Clarke wants to win it for Adam
                      
	Adelaide: Australia would do everything to win the final Test against India on Monday as a tribute to its retiring hero Adam Gilchrist, said centurion Michael Clarke.         
	I think its an ammunition for Gilly to go out with a win. Hes been an amazing part of the Australian team and we would like to win this last Test for him, said Clarke.         
	Clarkes comments on Gilchrist were indicative of the respect in which the retiring wicketkeeper-batsman is held within the team.         
	Obviously its a huge loss. The standing ovation which the crowd gave Gilly showed how much he is loved. How much he has helped change the game of cricket... He is a fantastic player and deserves all the respect he is getting now, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC meets today
                                                                                                                                                                                             ICC meets today
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Pakistans fate as the venue of the Champions Trophy may be decided on Sunday when top cricket officials of participating nations meet in Dubai to discuss the security situation in the country.         
	The ICC has called a meeting to brief all participating nations on security matters.         
	Even though the ICC isnt saying anything, speculation is rife that the high-profile tournament may be moved out of Pakistan.         
	Prior to the meeting, the ICC will not indulge in speculation and at this stage the tournament will proceed in Pakistan as scheduled, the ICC said in a statement.         
	Sri Lanka was first announced as a standby venue, but one learns South Africa and England have also been sounded out.         
	Many players from countries like England, Australia and South Africa have expressed reservations about playing there.         
	The timing of the briefing was agreed upon during the ICCs annual conference week in early July to allow the ICCs security consultants to provide a comprehensive report of arrangements at the Asia Cup.         
	This was not possible previously as that tournament was still ongoing.         
	Representatives of the ICCs broadcast partner ESPN-Star Sports and the Federation of International Cricketers Associations (Fica) have also been invited to attend the briefing.         
	Pakistan as a venue has been under scanner after blasts in Islamabad killed several people on the day of the Asia Cup final in Karachi. The very next day there were blasts in Karachi as well.

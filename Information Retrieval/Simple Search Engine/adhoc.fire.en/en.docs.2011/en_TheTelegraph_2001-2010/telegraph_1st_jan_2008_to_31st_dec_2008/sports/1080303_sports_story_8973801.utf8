                                                   Sachin: Critics dont worry me
            A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Sydney: Sachin Tendulkar on Sunday said he doesnt bother about critics who dont have anything better to do than comment without any credibility. After scoring an unbeaten 117 to guide India home in the first of the best-of-three finals, the maestro said he had to stick around despite a niggle in the groin because the team needed him.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Hitting a century after being slammed by critics         
	I dont worry too much about criticism because people say a lot of things. Sometimes they talk because theyve not been able to do certain things themselves. I look at the credibility of the person who is writing and Ive got people who actually guide me. I listen to those people... those who really matter to me would always pick up the phone and tell me.         
	The victory         
	Australia are the No.1 team. It was extremely important to play well in the second half of the tour.         
	His contribution         
	I think the youngsters are extremely talented and have a terrific future. Being the senior-most player it is my responsibility to guide them and give them direction but its up to them to take it or not. The youngsters also tell me a lot of things.         
	Holding Sir Dons bat         
	It was an experience to hold it The one that he actually played with. It was a special moment. I would always remember the moment. It was one of those afternoons when I saw a lot of things in the museum and it was absolutely fantastic. Its nice to follow that up with a hundred.         
	Carrying on despite the pain         
	Theres a bit of a niggle in my groin. It has not been allowing me to move as freely as I want to. Sometimes when it aggravates, you probably dont make the playing XI. But when you score a hundred and the team wins, you forget everything.         
	The beamer from Brett Lee         
	I know Brett very well and I can tell you that it was not intentional at all. All I told him was that when he comes to play the IPL in India, hell have to deal with my son whos a big fan of his. I am extremely sure that it slipped out of his hand         
	Sydney Cricket Ground         
	Away from India, SCG is surely my favourite ground. The century is also special as it has come in the first final.         
	On Rohit Sharma         
	I played a few times with him but this was the first time we had a long partnership. He was terrific Extremely calm and composed, which are his strengths.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni as captain         
	Dhoni has done a terrific job as a captain. We all have really enjoyed playing under him. The atmosphere in the dressing room is very relaxed Im not suggesting it wasnt so under Anil (Kumble).         
	Importance of a century         
	To score a 100 in Australia was something I always wanted to do and to get that at a special occasion makes you feel nice. To be honest, I did want that hundred.

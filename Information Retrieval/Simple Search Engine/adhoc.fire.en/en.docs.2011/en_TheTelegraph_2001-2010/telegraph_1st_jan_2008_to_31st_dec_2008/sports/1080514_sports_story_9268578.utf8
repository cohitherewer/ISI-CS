                                                                                                                                                                                                     CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Pak to host India in early 2009   
	Karachi: Pakistan will host three top teams in the first quarter of 2009 with India touring in January-February to play three Tests, five ODIs and two Twenty20 matches. The chairman of the PCB, Dr Nasim Ashraf, said after a governing body meeting in Islamabad that all the tours had been confirmed by the concerned cricket boards.  
	He said after Indias tour, Pakistan will host Sri Lanka for a one-day series in early April and then Australia for five ODIs from April 23 before the ICC World Twenty20 in England in June. Ashraf said with tours by India, Sri Lanka and Australia, the board expected to improve its financial position from sale of media rights this year.         
	Laxman out         
	New Delhi: In a setback to the beleaguered Deccan Chargers, their captain V.V.S. Laxman, sustaining an injury on his right wrist, has been ruled out of the remaining matches of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Laxman told reporters here that his injured right wrist will take two weeks to heal completely, which virtually gives him no chance to play in the remaining matches as his team plays their last league tie on May 27.         
	IPL final venue         
	Mumbai: An emergency meeting of the Mumbai Cricket Associations (MCA) managing committee has been convened here Wednesday following opposition to the move to shift the final of the IPL from the Wankhede Stadium to the D Y Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.         
	IPL authorities have cited absence of a proper place for having a TV control room for live telecast of the June 1 event.         
	Ryan feted         
	 London: Ryan Sidebottoms journey from county cricket stalwart to international star was confirmed Monday when he was named Englands Player of the Year. Sidebottom is now his countrys leading strike bowler and an integral part of the team set to open its three-Test series against New Zealand at Lords on Thursday. This time last year I was just training for Notts and playing regular county cricket, Sidebottom said. Its a huge turnaround but not one I want to get carried away with.         
	Test rankings         
	 Calcutta: England can move to second place in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship table if it beats New Zealand 3-0 in the upcoming series that gets underway at Lords on Thursday, says A Staff Reporter.         
	TEST RANKINGS         
	1. Australia (141); 2. India (111); 3. South Africa (109); 4. England (108); 5. Sri Lanka (106); 6. Pakistan (94); 7. New Zealand (91); 8. West Indies (77); 9. Bangladesh (1).         
	Dav suggestion         
	 Dharamsala: Dharamsala should be considered for hosting ODIs, NCA coach Dav Whatmore said Tuesday. The field and the wicket of the Dharamsala Cricket Stadium is very good. It must be considered for ODIs, Whatmore, who is holding a camp for North Zone here, said.         
	This is the reason we are a holding camp here, he added. Built in 2003, Dharamsala has so far hosted Duleep and Ranji Trophy matches besides a few unofficial matches featuring Pakistan and Australia in the past.

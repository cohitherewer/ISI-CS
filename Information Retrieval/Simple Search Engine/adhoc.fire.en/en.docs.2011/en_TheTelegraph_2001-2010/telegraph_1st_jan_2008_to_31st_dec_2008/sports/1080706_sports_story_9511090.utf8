The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I threw 83 final, says Jaegar
                                                                                                                                                                                             I threw 83 final, says Jaegar
                  Martina Navratilova was Andrea Jaegers opponent in the 1983 Big W final                     
	Wimbledon: Andrea Jaeger said in an interview with a British newspaper that she purposely lost the 1983 Wimbledon final to Martina Navratilova.         
	Jaeger turned professional at 14 and retired five years later after blowing out her shoulder in 1985 . She became a nun in 2006, and said she threw away the 1983 final at the All England Club in an interview published on Saturday.         
	During the match I missed balls on purpose. I hit right to Martina and when I was getting whipped in the first set 6-0, I tried to look upset about it, said Jaeger, who lost 6-0, 6-3. I glanced at my dad. He knew something was wrong because I never got nervous and always started great.         
	The American was just 18 in 1983 but insists she could see her path to a clean conscience with startling clarity  which was to lose to the woman who would end up with nine Wimbledon titles.         
	Jaeger said: Id beaten Martina on grass at Eastbourne just before the tournament, but the afternoon before the final, my dad saw an empty crisp packet in my room, which I wasnt supposed to have.         
	He also asked me about something he heard that happened in the locker-room. I refused to answer. If Id told him some of the things I encountered on the tennis circuit, hed have hurt people and pulled me out of that final. Over the years, I took a few beatings from my father to protect players and staff.         
	Dad was so angry that I would choose to protect them and not answer his question that I thought he was going to get his belt. I said I was sorry, grabbed my bra and my wallet and ran outside, aware dad wouldnt hit me in public.         
	I wanted to order a cab, so I went to the flat next door where Martina was staying. I was upset and kept pounding on the door and ringing the bell until Martinas trainer, Nancy Lieberman, opened the door and took me to the kitchen.         
	Martina was sitting in the living room. She glanced round at me briefly with a look on her face to say that Id interrupted her preparation for the final. She stayed seated and didnt look at me again. I couldnt have done that in her position, but all I thought at the time was: Ive changed her routine and affected her. I cant go out and try in the final now, Jaeger added.         
	Martina missed her chance to help her neighbour who was suffering in order to fulfill her desire, so I had to make it right. I gave up my desire to give someone their help.         
	I went on court in complete peace knowing that giving the match away was the right thing to do. I had to look myself in the mirror for the rest of my life. It meant more to Martina anyway, she further said.         
	 Jaeger explained how she deceived the spectators and the media during and after the match.         
	I needed to make the second set closer and I did, but not close enough to worry Martina. At changes of ends, I didnt want to look at the crowd. I felt bad that I wasnt giving them the best match as the fans were so good to me over the years, but I also felt that if they knew what had happened they would understand, she hoped.         
	God knows the truth. I knew the truth. I emailed Martina three years ago to say it doesnt take away from her win, but she never replied, the nun said.           (AGENCIES)

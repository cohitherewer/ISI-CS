                                                   Bail for Barton

           
	London: Newcastle United and England midfielder Joey Barton was granted bail on Thursday but with strict conditions and ordered to reappear in court on January 16. The decision by Liverpools Crown Court came hours after a lower court had refused the player bail, saying he was likely to commit offences if he were released from prison. 
    
	Barton, 25, was arrested along with his 19-year brother and a 27-year-old woman in the early hours of December 27 following an incident outside a restaurant in Liverpool.

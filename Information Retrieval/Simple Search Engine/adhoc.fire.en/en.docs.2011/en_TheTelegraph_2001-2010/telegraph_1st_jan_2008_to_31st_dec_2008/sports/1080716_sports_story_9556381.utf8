The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Thanou makes the cut
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Thanou makes the cut
                      
	Athens: Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou, who was banned for two years after a doping scandal on the eve of the Athens 2004 Olympics, has made the team for next months Games and could travel to Beijing, officials said on Tuesday.         
	The Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) included Thanou in the Greece squad after she finished fifth in a 100 metres race on the island of Crete late on Monday with a time of 11.39 seconds. She has made the B time for the team so she is on it, Greeces chef de mission Isidoros Kouvelos said during the preliminary squad presentation.         
	The B time is the lower qualification mark that if beaten by another Greek athlete in the same discipline would force Thanou out of the team, although that is highly unlikely. Thanou and fellow sprinter Costas Kenteris were at the heart of the biggest Olympic doping scandal in years when they missed a drugs test before the Athens opening ceremony.

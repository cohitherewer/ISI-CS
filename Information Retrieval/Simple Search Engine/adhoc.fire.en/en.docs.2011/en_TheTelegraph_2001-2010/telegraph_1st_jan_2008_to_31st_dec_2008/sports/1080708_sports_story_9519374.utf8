The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Probably my best: Nadal
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Probably my best: Nadal
                  Rafael Nadal                     
	London: Wimbledon champion Rafael Nadal said his victory over defending champion Roger Federer in Sundays final was the most emotional and probably the best of his career.         
	The 22-year-old also said he had never wavered in his quest for victory even though five-time winner Federer came back from two sets down in a final twice interrupted by rain that finished in near darkness.         
	It was the most emotional match I have played in my life Probably the best, Nadal, also the French Open champion, said after arguably one of the greatest Grand Slam finals of all time that lasted nearly five hours.         
	To win here on grass is very special. To win Wimbledon for us Spaniards is hard to imagine, he said of a victory he called a childhood dream.         
	I love to play on this surface Because you have options.         
	You cant play very defensively, but you can go to the net, it is an interesting game.         
	I think you have to understand this surface if you want good results here, Nadal, who has worked hard to adapt from his more familiar clay courts, said.         
	Winning here will stay with me for the rest of my life. Of the four Grand Slams it is the most traditional, said Nadal, who was reduced to tears on court after his victory.         
	When I won my first at Roland Garros I also cried, Nadal added.         
	He said he was congratulated afterwards by the only other Spaniard to win at Wimbledon, 1966 champion Manuel Santana.         
	He was overcome with emotion just like me. I thanked him for his support during the whole week, Nadal said.         
	Asked whether the rain delays had affected his concentration and resolve, he said: No. After losing the two previous finals (to Federer), my motivation was up in the clouds.         
	He suggested, however, that the delays may have been more beneficial to Federer.         
	The players who serve best are those that dont need so much match rhythm Although the delays are for both.         
	Federer saved many situations with his service.         
	Nadal paid tribute to his great rival, saying: Well, it is disappointing for me I am in the same time as the best player in history, Roger Federer.         
	I just congratulate Roger, because he always fights unbelievably, he said. (AGENCIES)

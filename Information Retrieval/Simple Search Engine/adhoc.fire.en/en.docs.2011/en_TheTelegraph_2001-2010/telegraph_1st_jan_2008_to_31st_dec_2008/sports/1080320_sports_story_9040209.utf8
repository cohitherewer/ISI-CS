The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichungs date with Kahn hits AIFF hurdle
                                                   Bhaichungs date with Kahn hits AIFF hurdle
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Thanks to the crossfire between the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and the Indian Football Association (IFA), national captain Bhaichung Bhutia may lose the chance of a lifetime to showcase his skill against Oliver Kahn and Co. in the high profile exhibition match at the Salt Lake Stadium on May 27.         
	The AIFF, clearly upset with Bengal Peerless and the IFA for going ahead with the preparations for hosting the Bayern Munich-Mohun Bagan match without taking the parent body into confidence, has made it clear that no national team star would be allowed to don the green and maroon jersey in Kahns farewell tie.         
	The AIFF is yet to grant a formal permission to the IFA to host the match, giving an impression that it is acting like a stumbling block.         
	In a letter to the IFA and Mohun Bagan on Tuesday, the AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, said that under no circumstances would the federation release the Mohun Bagan players who would be busy at the national camp for the SAFF meet.         
	The Indians leave for the Maldives on May 31. Four Mohun Bagan players  Mohan Raj, Deepak Mondal, N.S. Manju and Bhaichung  have been called for the national camp.         
	While the organisers said that they had gone through the proper channels and had no intention of undermining the AIFF, the parent body said it was disappointed with the way things were conducted.         
	We have nothing against Bengal Peerless or the IFA, said Colaco. We do appreciate their attempt to play their part in promoting the game but they should have taken us into confidednce before finalising the deal.         
	The AIFF was kept in the dark when the match was announced, Colaco added. Thats not the way things are done... Anyone who desires to host such a match will have to fulfil a few criteria. When the IFA asked for permission, all we did was to raise a few questions.         
	According to sources, the federation has asked the IFA to specify the financial terms of Bengal Peerless with Bayern Munich; the benefits that the IFA will derive from marketing and sale of tickets and who would pay the levies that the AIFF, AFC and Fifa are entitled to from the match.         
	In a strongly worded letter to the IFA, the federation has also asked them not to hold any news conference regarding the match. However, Bengal Peerless on Wednesday interacted with the media, stating that Bayern Munich will land in Calcutta on May 25 and leave three days later.         
	Fearing repercussions, the officials of Bengal Peerless and the IFA are now not ready to go on record.         
	IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly said: I admit that it was a bit careless on the part of Bengal Peerless not to have taken the AIFF into confidence before talking to Bayern. But once they returned from Munich, they had informed the AIFF immediately.         
	But the federation alleged that the Calcutta-based company wanted to build up pressure on national and state federations so that they ultimately succumb to their pressure.

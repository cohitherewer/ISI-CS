The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith, Amla hit centuries
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Smith, Amla hit centuries
                      
	Bloemfontein: Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla hit unbeaten centuries as South Africa punished Bangladeshs bowling attack on the first day of the first Test on Wednesday.         
	South Africa ended the day, cut short by nine overs by nearly an hour of rain and bad light, on 299 for one with Smith on 138 and Amla on 103.         
	Smith, who struck his 17th Test century, and Amla combined for an unbeaten second-wicket stand of 197 as South Africa took a grip on the match after Bangladesh had bowled tightly for the first hour after winning the toss.         
	Smith struck 14 fours and a six and broke Jacques Kalliss South African record of 1288 runs in a calendar year, made in 2004. South Africas captain ended the day on 1317 runs.         
	Bangladesh took their first wicket after nearly three hours of play, Neil McKenzies square-drive off Shahadat Hossain slicing to Mehrab Hossain at backward point. The catch ended an opening stand of 102 between Smith and McKenzie, who scored 42.

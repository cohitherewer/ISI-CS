The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Carlos Moya all for technology
                                                Carlos Moya all for technology
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: He believes Life is the most beautiful game and has done his bit to make the world a little better. Apart from being involved in countless charity efforts in hometown Mallorca, the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year in 2005 donated his entire 2005 Chennai Open prize money to Tsunami relief efforts.         
	But ask the former world No.1 about his humanitarian efforts and watch him recoil in sheer unease.         
	Carlos Moya is one of a rare breed. And that becomes evident as soon as one starts to talk to him. Please I dont want to say about anything about my charity-related efforts. In fact, I was quite keen not to make it public when I donated the money but it was something beyond my control Id rather not speak about it.         
	The former French Open champion, in his rather heavy Spanish accent, then went on to say how he thinks technology has changed the game for the better. You know 2-5 down and facing a matchpoint, when you are chucked out of the semi-finals of an ATP meet owing to the error of a linesman, you find it hard to digest.         
	I am all for technology, if it is for the betterment of the game Be it tennis, football or any other sport, said Moya. And if it means employing less people and relying more on machines, so be it.         
	At 31, when most of his ilk have already hung or are thinking about hanging up their boots, Moya seems refreshingly different. Not only does he trace the lineage of the game down from John McEnroe through Pete Sampras and now Roger Federer, Moya thinks the 20-somethings of today are more complete players.         
	Look at them. They are so organised even at 20. They are so hardened pros. When I was 20 I didnt play like that. Everybody is more prepared these days More compact and knowledgeable about their and others game.         
	The former French Open champions has no regrets and is more or less sure to hang around for a couple more years. When asked about his retirement plans, Oh I havent thought about it Moya said with a shrug.

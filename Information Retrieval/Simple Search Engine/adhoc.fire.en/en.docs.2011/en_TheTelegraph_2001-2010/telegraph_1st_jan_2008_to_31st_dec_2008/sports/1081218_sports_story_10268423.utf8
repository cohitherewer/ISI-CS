The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia fight back on Day I
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Australia fight back on Day I
                      
	Australia fought back from a dreadful start on the first day of their series against South Africa, turning a scoreline of 15 for three into 341 for nine at close.         
	The tourists got away to a flier when they knocked over Australias three most feared batsmen inside the first six overs, according to cricinfo.         
	The game was not 20 minutes old when Makhaya Ntini dismissed Matthew Hayden and Ponting in successive balls.         
	The third wicket came a few moments later when Mike Hussey was brilliantly taken by AB de Villiers in the slips.         
	Simon Katich (83) and Michael Clarke (62) shared a 149-run stand to stem the fall of wickets.         
	Andrew Symonds (57) and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (46) put on 93 for the sixth wicket.         
	Ntini picked up three for 66 while Steyn, Morkel and Harris picked up two wickets each.         
	At the end of an even, day neither team would feel unhappy with their position but equally each side missed chances to finish with a handy edge.

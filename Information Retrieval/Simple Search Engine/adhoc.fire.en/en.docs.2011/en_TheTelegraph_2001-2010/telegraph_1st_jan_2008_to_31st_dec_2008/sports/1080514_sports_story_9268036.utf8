The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Twenty20 too fast for sledging: David 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Twenty20 too fast for sledging: David 
            A STAFF REPORTER            David Hussey                           
	Calcutta: From being an unknown figure to one of the most sought after players in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), life has sprung a surprise on David Hussey.         
	Younger brother of Australias celebrated middle-order batsman Michael, David is still coming to terms with the adulation and fanfare that he has suddenly been subjected to after becoming one of captain Sourav Gangulys trusted lieutenants in the Kolkata Knight Riders squad.         
	Looking relaxed in a pair of sandals and tracksuit at the team hotel on Tuesday, a few hours before his teams clash against the visiting Delhi DareDevils, Hussey said the standard of cricket in this Twenty20 league has been unbelievable.         
	The standard of cricket in the Indian Premier League (IPL) is unbelievable. Its a great opportunity for me to rub shoulders with the worlds best in business  the likes of Sourav Ganguly and Shoaib Akhtar, said Hussey, who fetched an astronomical sum in the IPL players auction, more than even his brother Michael or Australia captain Ricky Ponting.         
	Hussey has been absolutely bowled over by Souravs captaincy and the charm of owner Shah Rukh Khan.         
	Not only is Sourav a great batsman but is also a great leader. I have been watching him from very close quarters and I am very impressed with his acumen.         
	As for Shah Rukh, he is such a down to earth bloke with no airs about him He is always there for us.         
	Hussey appeared quite nonplussed about questions on Martin Samuels  the West Indies batsman who was on Tuesday banned for two years on charges of breaking rules intended to prevent players from betting on matches.         
	I believe match fixing has no place in cricket Its such an interesting game in itself The topic has not even come up for discussion in our dressing room, said the Knight Riders batsman.         
	Being an Australian, it was perhaps inevitable that the swashbuckling batsman would have to field questions on sledging. But Hussey played it with a straight bat.         
	Look, Twenty20 is such a fast game that one has to remain focused all the time. We dont even have enough time for sledging, he quipped.         
	But he firmly believes that the IPL has served to bring Australians and Indians closer after their acrimonious series Down Under.         
	IPL has been fantastic in building bridges. In fact, in our dressing room, Ponting got on famously with the Souravs and the Ishants It has made a world of difference.         
	Asked to pick his favourite team in the IPL, Hussey said it was the Shane Warne-led Rajasthan Royals.         
	They have done marvellously, havent they? I mean the way they have been performing But we are getting there We are slowly building up a nice rhythm, he said.         
	Hussey, who hopes to catch the attention of Australian national selectors with his performance in the league, picked Irfan Pathan as his favourite cricketer.         
	Among bowlers, it has to be Dale Steyn and my teammate Murali Kartik My favourite batsmen are Sourav and Shaun Marsh of Kings XI Punjab         
	When it comes to his favourite captain though, Hussey answered even before one could complete the question.         
	Sourav, who else?         
	No surprises there.

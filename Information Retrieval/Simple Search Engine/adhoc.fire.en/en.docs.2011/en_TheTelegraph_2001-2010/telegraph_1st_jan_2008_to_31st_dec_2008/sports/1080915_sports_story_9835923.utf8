The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav omission baffles Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                           Sourav omission baffles Ponting
                      
	New Delhi: Sourav Gangulys omission from the Rest of India squad for the Irani Trophy has baffled Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who believes it would be interesting to face an Indian team sans the belligerent left-hander, if he is left out of the Indian Test squad.         
	Although the Indian Fab Four of Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and V. V. S. Laxman came a cropper in the Test series in Sri Lanka, Ponting did not read too much into it.         
	Every series is different. You can go through one series not doing very well but in the start of the next series, you can start off and make a big score and suddenly you are back on track again. That is what cricket is all about. Things can change so quickly in the game, Ponting told a TV channel in Dubai.         
	But the one thing I have noticed is that Sourav hasnt been named in the initial squad (the Rest of India squad), and that I think is going to be interesting for me during the tour, said the Australian, recovering from a wrist surgery.         
	Ponting, meanwhile, predicted that it would be a re-building phase for the Indian team over the next 12 months.           (PTI)

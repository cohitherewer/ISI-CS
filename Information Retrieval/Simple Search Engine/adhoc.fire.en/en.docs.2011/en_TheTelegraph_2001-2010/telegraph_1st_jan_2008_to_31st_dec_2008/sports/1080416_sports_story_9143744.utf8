The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Leander Paes looks to dilute tension
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Leander Paes looks to dilute tension
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes                           
	New Delhi: Leander Paes is trying his best to dilute the tension that cropped up between him and Mahesh Bhupathi during the Davis Cup tie against Japan.         
	Fresh controversy erupted on the opening day of the tie last Friday when Paes was quoted in an interview saying that he regretted sacrificing his singles career for Bhupathi.         
	The Indian captain vehemently denied saying that agreeing to play with Bhupathi had been the worst decision of his career, insisting he had been misquoted.         
	On Tuesday, however, Paes had nothing but good things to say about his former doubles partner. He said he was looking forward to pairing up with Bhupathi to win his second Olympic medal.         
	The Olympics is very near and dear to my heart, Paes said. I am excited by the prospect of playing in Beijing. I am sure I and Bhupathi stand a good chance of winning there.         
	Paes, however, ruled out any possibility of teaming up with Bhupathi before the Olympics. Both of us have different partners in the (ATP) circuit. So there is no chance of playing with Bhupathi. But then, we will remain sharp in match practice and should not face any problems at Beijing, he said.         
	On Bhupathis reportedly saying that quite a few things should be resolved before the Olympics, Paes said the decision was in the All India Tennis Associations hands.         
	The AITA, it seems, is in no hurry to sort out the problems and though it is determined to keep Paes as the captain till the end of the year, it hasnt yet made it official.         
	Towards the end of February, Davis Cup players Prakash Amritraj and Rohan Bopanna, supported by Bhupathi and Karan Rastogi, wrote to the AITA refusing to play the tie against Japan if Paes continued as captain.         
	The AITA, according to sources, is confident that all the players will fall in line before the World Group play-off tie in September.         
	The victory over Japan, meanwhile, moved India to No. 24 in the ITFs Davis Cup rankings.         
	One of the eight seeded teams  Australia, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Israel, South Korea, Romania and Slovakia  will be India s opponents in the World Group play-offs to be held from September 19-21.         
	The other unseeded nations in the play-offs are Brazil, Chile, Britain, The Netherlands, Switzerland and Peru.         
	India will know who their opponents are on Wednesday when the draw is announced at the ITF office in London.

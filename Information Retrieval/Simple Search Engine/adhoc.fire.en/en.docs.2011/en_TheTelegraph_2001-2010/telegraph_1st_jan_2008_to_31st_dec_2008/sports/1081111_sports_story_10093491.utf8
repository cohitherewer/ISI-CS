            A STAFF REPORTER     
	Calcutta: India have moved into second place in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship table after the 2-0 series win over Australia that helped them regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.         
	The home team wrapped up a 172-run victory on the final day in Nagpur and in the process gained seven ratings points to draw level with South Africa on 116, according to an ICC release.         
	Graeme Smiths team, however, slipped just below India to third position by a fraction of a rating point.         
	All is not lost for the Proteas though. If they win both Tests in the two-match series against Bangladesh, they will be back to second position.         
	India can also strengthen their position if they win the series against England.         
	This is the first time since a rain-affected tour to Sri Lanka in 1999 that Australia have lost a series without winning a single match.         
	As a result of the 0-2 defeat, Australia have lost nine ratings points to fall below 130 for the first time since April 2006.         
	It is also the first time since 2001 that Australia have played an entire series without winning a match.         
	RANKINGS         
	1. Australia (129 pts); 2. India (116); 3. South Africa (116); 4. Sri Lanka (108); 5. England (104); 6. Pakistan (100); 7. New Zealand (82); 8. West Indies (81); 9. Bangladesh (1).

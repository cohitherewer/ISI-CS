The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinda, three others are in the picture
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dinda, three others are in the picture
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ashok Dinda                           
	Calcutta: Bengals Ashok Dinda could make it to the India squad for the last two ODIs of the ongoing series, in Guwahati and Delhi, if captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten choose to have a look at him.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the national selectors may rest spearheads Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma, unless Dhoni and Kirsten want them around till the end of the series.         
	If both get rested, then the door could open for somebody like Dinda, who has been among the wickets this season (11 in two Ranji matches).         
	Three other medium-pacers are also being talked about. They are Punjabs Manpreet Singh Gony, who has played ODIs, and two rookies  Mumbais Dhawal Kulkarni and Gujarats Siddharth Trivedi.         
	Its not confirmed, but it wont surprise if off-spinner Harbhajan Singh is given a break.         
	The selectors (Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) will be meeting in Bhubaneshwar on Thursday morning.         
	Also on their agenda is picking the Board Presidents XI for the match against England, in Vadodara.         
	Incidentally, as the series has been won, theres a chance that the selectors may go unrepresented in the last two ODIs, with all five watching the Ranji Trophy.

                                                   Vijai vows to swing back 

           
	Kapalua (Hawaii): Vijai Singh, armed with a revamped swing and a new fitness trainer, is eager to return to winning ways in his title defence at this weeks Mercedes-Benz Championship. 
    
	The former world No. 1 has not tasted victory on the PGA Tour in nine months and is determined to erase memories of a largely frustrating 2007 campaign. Last year I was very disappointed in the way I played, Singh said in the build-up to the 2008 PGA Tours opening event. 
    
	Although I had two wins, I was really very discouraged by the way I played in the mid-season and during the majors. The two wins came early in the season, in the first three months, and the rest of the season was pretty cold for me. 
    
	I did not perform like I thought I would. I had my chances but just never closed the deal. It was very disappointing. 
    
	Singh clinched the Mercedes-Benz Championship by two shots in Kapalua last January before winning his 31st PGA Tour title two months later at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. 
    
	Despite close calls at the Wachovia Championship in May and the Canadian Open in July, he failed to add to his trophy cabinet. 
    
	I know guys go through their whole career not winning one event, the 44-year-old Fijian said. My expectations are pretty high. I dont like playing six months and not winning a tournament. I felt like I let myself down there.

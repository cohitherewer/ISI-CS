The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal tops Simpson in sudden death play-off
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Atwal tops Simpson in sudden death play-off
  - It was a big grind for me, says Indian             Atwal                           
	Chattanooga (USA): Arjun Atwal will return to the PGA Tour next season after regaining his card with a sudden death play-off win at the Nationwide Tours Chattanooga Classic, his maiden title triumph in the United States.         
	The Orlando-based golfer, who earned a whopping $90,000 cheque for his triumph, rose to 15th from 34th in the Nationwide money list with total earnings of $2,48,000.         
	The top 25 in the money list make the cut for PGA Tour at the end of the season. With this, the Indian now has cards on four Tours  Asian, European, PGA and Nationwide.         
	And with just two tournaments to go in the Nationwide Tour, the 34-year-old, who lost his PGA card after a disastrous 2007 season, is unlikely to drop out of the top-25 after this massive win.         
	Atwal (72) and overnight second and local favourite Webb Simpson (69) finished regulation play at Black Creek at 24-under 264, two strokes shy of the tournament record.                   
	After a front-nine that was studded with a birdie and an eagle against a lone bogey, Atwal had a two-shot lead on the 16th tee but drove into a fairway bunker and had to chip out. The Indian hit a poor third shot into a greenside bunker resulting in a double-bogey. Simpson made par on that hole leaving the duo tied.         
	Both players then two-putted the par-five 18th for birdies before heading back to the tee for the playoff.         
	While Atwal kept his cool, nerves got the better of the 23-year-old Simpson, whose second shot found the greenside bunker after both had driven in to the fairway.         
	Atwal hit a hybrid club to 25 feet before comfortably two-putting for a birdie.         
	Either one of us could have won in that playoff, and it just happened so that he missed that putt. But hes a great player, hes going to win a lot of tournaments, and it was for me as far as Im concerned, it was a big grind today, said Atwal.

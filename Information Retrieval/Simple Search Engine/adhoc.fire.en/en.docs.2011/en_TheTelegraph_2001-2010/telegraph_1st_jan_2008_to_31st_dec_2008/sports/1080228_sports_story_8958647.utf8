The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI plays down issue
                                                   BCCI plays down issue
                      
	Sydney: The BCCI and the team management on Wednesday refused to comment on Cricket Australias (CA) decision to let off Matthew Hayden with a reprimand for his obnoxious weed comment on Harbhajan Singh, saying it was CAs internal matter.         
	We have nothing to do with what CA is doing (on Hayden). We are here to play cricket and not get involved in what he says, team manager Dr Vimal Soni said in his first reaction after Hayden was let off with just a reprimand.         
	He (Hayden) has done that off the field and that is not the prerogative of the Indian team. But I want to make it clear that none of the players are feeling the pinch or any nervousness.         
	Nobody is bothered about what Hayden has said and what CA has done to him. We are focusing on cricket only, to play the finals in Sydney and Brisbane, Dr Soni said.         
	The BCCI also did not prefer to comment on CAs decision.         
	Hayden made the comments off the field and we have nothing to comment on CAs decision. That is their internal matter, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said in Mumbai.

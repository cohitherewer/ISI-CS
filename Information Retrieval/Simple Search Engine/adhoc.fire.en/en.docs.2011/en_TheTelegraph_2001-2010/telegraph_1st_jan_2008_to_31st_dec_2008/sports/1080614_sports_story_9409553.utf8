The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sweden lock horns with familiar foes 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sweden lock horns with familiar foes 
                      
	Innsbruck: Familiar foes Sweden and Spain meet at Euro 2008 on Saturday with nothing but mutual respect after locking horns in qualifying. Sweden are a very difficult side to play against, Spain coach Luis Aragones said. They are definitely a team to worry about.         
	Opposite number Lars Lagerback expressed similar sentiments. They like to keep the ball and are very dangerous in attack. We will have to be patient and play our own game.         
	Spain finished two points ahead of Sweden in qualification although honours were even in head-to-head meetings, the Scandinavians winning 2-0 in Solna in October 2006, but then going down 0-3 in November last year.         
	Spain have no significant injury problems and Aragones is likely to stick with the same side that beat Russia. Striker David Villa suffered a hairline fracture to his right index finger after getting it caught in Fernando Torress shirt during celebrations for his opening goal but will be available.         
	Zlatan Ibrahimovic has a swollen knee but should be fit enough to start again alongside Henrik Larsson up front.           (REUTERS)

	Calcutta: Shane Warne does not believe Australia have lost the edge after losing the Perth Test. 
    
	I can hear all the experts saying the reign is over and the decline is upon us. I dont believe that for a second. India just played well and did not allow Australia to dominate  they were up for the contest, Warne wrote in his column for Australias The Daily Telegraph. 
    
	Unfortunately, it looked from a distance that the wicket was pretty poor and not conducive to strokeplay. In cricketing terms, you were never in as a batsman, hence not one batsman from either side made a century Australia fought all the way, he wrote. 
    
	Congratulations to Anil Kumble and India on their victory and stopping Australia on their march to an amazing 17 victories in a row. It was an impressive performance. 
    
	The legendary leg-spinner did not wish to compare Steve Waughs side with Ricky Pontings men. Comparisons in cricket will always be there, its just the nature of the beast. Ive been asked which is the better side  Pontings, that won 16 Tests in a row, or Steves. 
    
	Both were excellent teams. Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Brett Lee have improved to be the best in the world right now. Mike Hussey, Michael Clarke, Stuart Clark and Andrew Symonds are all at the top of their games, too. 
    
	But its still probably a bit too early to start comparing them with the Waugh brothers, the Boons and McGraths just yet, he felt. 
    
	After the fiasco of the Sydney Test, it was good to see cricket had not suffered and the skill level and intensity were still very high. There have been some suggestions Australia lost their edge and were too concerned about their image going into Perth. 
    
	Sport is about passion and attitude and knowing yourself. Australia play best when they get in the face of the opposition and are very aggressive. Maybe they were not as aggressive in their body language in Perth as they normally are, but I think that was the nature of this Test, in which they were behind for most of the game. 
    
	Warne was all praise for Anil Kumble. Congratulations to Kumble on joining the 600 wickets club. He is one of the most competitive opposition players I have ever played against, a true champion and a credit to the game and his family. 
    
	He is very strong mentally. There were times when everyone wrote him off, but to his credit he stayed true to himself and stuck to his style. Well done, mate.

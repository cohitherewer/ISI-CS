The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knight Riders morale   gets a lift
                                                                                                                                                                                           Knight Riders morale   gets a lift
            GAJINDER SINGH                            
	Chandigarh: Saturday night the strain on his face was evident. Five losses on the trot seemed to have left him exhausted. The post-match captains press conference was over before it could actually begin. Not so on Sunday.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders left Chandigarh feeling a lot better than they were barely 12 hours ago after they lost a close match to Kings XI Punjab. Reason: The stay of the ban on Shoaib Akhtar by the appellate tribunal of the Pakistan Cricket Board for a month, enabling him to play for the Knight Riders in the IPL.         
	I cannot address the media. Not now, said Sourav Ganguly, as he left for the airport late in the afternoon.         
	Coach John Buchanan was delighted when the news broke on various television channels. But he, too, played safe. I have just heard about Shoaibs ban being lifted and his availability in the IPL. But I cannot say much at the moment.         
	When asked whether the Pakistani pacers inclusion would change the dynamics in the team and make it stronger, Buchanan simply smiled.         
	I am yet to get the details on Shoaib. The team is improving, he said.         
	Murali Kartik, who had gone out of the hotel for a while, stood for a moment before the television in the lobby when he came back, before entering the elevator. No comments here too. Just a smile.         
	The news on Shoaib seems to have lifted the morale of the team that has been down in the dumps after a brilliant start in the tournament.

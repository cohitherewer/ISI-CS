The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India were defensive: Clarke
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India were defensive: Clarke
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Australian vice-captain Michael Clarke on Saturday called India a defensive side and said his team would go for a victory on the final day of the third Test match.         
	We have seen this evening India sending a nightwatchman, they are pretty defensive, Clarke said at the end of the days play. I know Australia will certainly be the one team out there tomorrow (Sunday) trying to win.         
	Well try and take a couple of early wickets, well be attacking, he said. India wont set us any target tomorrow. There is some spin on this track and hopefully our spinners will be able to make best use of it.         
	Clarke, who scored his eighth Test century, admitted he was lucky to get it at the Kotla on Saturday.         
	I was definitely lucky, he said. I could have been out before 40 and a couple of times in the 90s. It was the one, I wasnt happy with, he said. But it is personally very rewarding to make another century in India.         
	After the second Test, we had a really good chat about the senior players standing up in this Test match. I think weve done that so far.         
	Asked about Kumble, Clarke said: He was fantastic. He is a chap who wants to do everything he can. He took wickets today and has got into the Test match. He is a great player.

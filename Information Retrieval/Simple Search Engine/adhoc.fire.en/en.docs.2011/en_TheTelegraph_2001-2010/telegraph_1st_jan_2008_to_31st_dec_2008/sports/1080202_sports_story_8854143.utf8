                                                    Indian trio slip under windy conditions

	Dubai: The Indian trio of Jyoti Randhawa, Jeev Milkha Singh and Shiv Kapur struggled at the Emirates Golf Club and failed to return sub-par cards to tumble down the leaderboard after the second round of the Dubai Desert Classic here on Friday. The desert winds made putting tough. 
    
	Kapur was the lone Indian to avoid an over-par card as he turned in a 72 after striking in two birdies and an eagle against four bogeys to take his total to four-under 140 and settle for a share of the 13th spot with  among others  South African Ernie Els. 
    
	However, it turned out to be nightmarish day for overnight tied second, Jeev and Randhawa. While Jeev stumbled to eight bogeys  including a hattrick  in his round of 76, Randhawa was hardly any better with his five dropped shots in a card of 74. 
    
	Jeev is now perched at the tied 36th position with a total of one-under 143. Randhawa, on the other hand, occupies the tied 20th spot with a total of three-under 141. 
    
	At the top, Tiger Woods continued to lead the pack after a one-under 71 took his total to eight-under 136. The world No. 1 holds a one-stroke lead over Irishman Damien McGrane, who carded a three-under 69. 
    
	Woods birdied the last hole to earn a one-shot lead but it was Irish journeyman McGrane who grabbed the spotlight. 
    
	The 36-year-old McGrane, ranked 319th in the world, ignored gusts of 25mph which whipped up a desert sandstorm to shoot a three-under-par 69 for a seven-under total of 137 and second place behind Woods (71). 
    
	Stenson (70) of Sweden shared third position on 138 with Frenchman Thomas Levet (71). 
    
	Spains Sergio Garcia was among a group one stroke further adrift while three-time champion Els and Order of Merit leader Lee Westwood were back on 140. 
    
	Its nice to see my name near the top of the leaderboard, said McGrane, who has never finished higher than third in a European Tour event. Golf is a tough game and its been a long road for me. 
    
	I have to make the most of what I do. No matter who I am playing with, whether its yourself or Tiger, I have to try and do the same thing, play my own game, sink a few putts and hopefully the numbers add up at the end, he said.

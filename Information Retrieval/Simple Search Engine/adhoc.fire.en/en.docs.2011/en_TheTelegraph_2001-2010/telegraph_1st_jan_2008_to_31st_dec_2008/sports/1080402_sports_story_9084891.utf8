                                                     Liverpool destiny at Torres feet
            MARK OGDEN            Fernando Torres                           
	Considering the whirlwind impact he has made in his debut campaign in English football, El Nino is an appropriate nickname for Fernando Torres, the man who has Liverpools destiny this season at his goal-scoring feet.         
	Having taken his goals tally for Liverpool this season to 28 in 38 games with his match-winner against Everton on Sunday, Torres is perfectly primed to take his devastating talents back on to the Champions League stage when the Merseysiders commence their epic trilogy against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Very few foreign forwards have enjoyed such a successful start to life in the Premiership as Torres and, where Liverpool were once ridiculed as a one-man team reliant on the talents of Steven Gerrard, the Spaniard is now proving himself to be, perhaps, of greater value to his team than his captain.         
	Sundays goal against Everton enabled Torres to join a select band of Liverpool forwards that have scored in six successive home league games. Fred Pagnam (1919), Roger Hunt (1964), Ian Rush (1983) and Michael Owen (1999) may yet be eclipsed if Torres makes it a magnificent seven against Blackburn on April 13.         
	Torres said: I always feel confident that I can score at Anfield. Ive scored 19 Premier League goals there now which is fantastic for me and I seem to score most in front of the Kop (the terrace for fans at Anfield). I dont know why that is, but Im always scoring at that end.         
	It was special to score in the derby. In Spain, I only scored once in a derby and was never on the winning team, so its very good to get a first derby win.         
	With local pride secured, Liverpool must now reaffirm their European credentials against Arsenal. While they toil away in search of a first domestic title since 1990, the Champions League has been a faithful friend with two final appearances in the last three seasons.         
	Chelsea have twice been defeated in two-legged ties on the way to those Finals, but Torres admits that there was little satisfaction within the dressing-room at being paired with an English rival.         
	He said: We didnt want an English team, but weve got Arsenal. They arent playing as well as they have been, but they got a crucial victory on Saturday.         
	The first game at the Emirates is going to be difficult. It will be important for us to score because it will make it better in the second leg.         
	Rafael Benitezs tactic of deploying Gerrard in an advanced role just behind Torres has helped spark the Spain internationals recent goal glut and Gerrard is likely to be handed similar instructions against Arsenal.         
	The England midfielder was a driving force as Liverpool lifted the European Cup in 2005 and progressed to the final last season and he believes that the clubs European pedigree now gives them a crucial edge.         
	Gerrard said: Were a good side in Europe and were always confident, no matter who we come up against, that well qualify. We have nothing to fear. The Champions League games against Arsenal are going to be different to the league game on Saturday. We found the Champions League games we had against Chelsea were different to the Premier League games, but we know we are in for two very tough games.         
	Before the draw was made, we were looking to get a team from Europe rather than the Premier League. But you get what you are given and, to win the European Cup, you have to beat the best sides.         
	Our aim is to consolidate fourth position in the Premier League and go all the way to Moscow. Thats our focus.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

                                                                                                                                                                                           Raring to go: Gary
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Team India coach Gary Kirsten is not taking the ensuing triangular series in Bangladesh lightly and is confident that his boys will deliver.         
	The 40-year old South African, who reached the city on Friday night, was quite optimistic about Indias performance in the tri-series also involving Pakistan and the hosts. India will play Pakistan in their opening match on Tuesday.         
	I am confident of a good outing in Bangladesh But I am not taking it lightly. Even in my playing days I never took any team lightly, Kirsten said.         
	The players are in good rhythm after the Indian Premier League (IPL) They are raring to go And after a good show in the IPL, they must be looking forward to playing for India, he said.         
	Kirsten, who was roped in as Indias coach in December 2007 for two years, will be on his first assignment in Bangladesh as a full-fledged coach.         
	With scores going beyond the 200 mark in the recently concluded Twenty20 tournament, will the 50-over format see teams notching above 400? Fifty overs a side match is certainly different A 50-over game is a 50-over game Here the batsman will get more time to settle down and a good score is expected.         
	Hailing the IPL as a stepping stone for the talented youngsters in the country, Kirsten said: Its a good platform for young players. Lot of young talent have emerged and showed their potential  They are the fitter lot.         
	He however, does not think that Pakistan will be weaker after Mohammed Asif was ruled out of the series. Pakistan is a balanced side They are not solely dependent on Asif There are other good bowlers in the side and they can at any time be good, Kirsten said.         
	Meanwhile, Team India mental-conditioning coach Paddy Upton, who accompanied Kirsten to the city on Friday night, said: My first job is to understand their mentality and then to build a good understanding between them.

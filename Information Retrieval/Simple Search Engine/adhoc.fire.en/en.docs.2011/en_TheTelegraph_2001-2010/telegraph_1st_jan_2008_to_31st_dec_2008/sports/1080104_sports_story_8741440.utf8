	Sydney: The Man of the Day, V.V.S. Laxman, spoke to the media after stumps on Day II of the second Test. Later, he had a brief one-on-one with The Telegraph at the Radisson Plaza. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
    
	On remaining an unsung hero of sorts 
    
	The way I look at it is that its great getting opportunities to play for the country and Ive got the opportunity in 88 Tests... Instead of thinking of other things, whats important is to accept responsibility and give off your best. 
    
	On having a superb average against Australia  52.70 
    
	Its satisfying for any cricketer to do well against the best team in the world... Im pleased that Ive consistently done so against Australia, particularly in tough situations. 
    
	On whether his hundred (109, with two chances) on Thursday is the best of his three at the SCG 
    
	Wouldnt say so as all three hundreds are close to each other (in terms of being special)... Im just very happy that I could do the job today... Pleased that I could play my shots... 
    
	On taking guard at a ground which has been special 
    
	The earlier performances give a boost... You know the ambience, know how the wicket behaves... It gives confidence. 
    
	On having got out soon after the dismissal of Rahul Dravid, with whom he had a jumbo partnership 
    
	Its disappointing... Id have loved to remain unbeaten and resume on the third day. 
    
	On his departure soon after Dravids confirming that outstanding partnerships actually end in twos 
    
	(Grins) Somehow, it keeps happening... However, I wouldnt say that the partner who is not out becomes conscious that a big partnership has been broken. 
    
	On his 175-run partnership with Dravid 
    
	We played our game and didnt interfere with each other, so to say... Its important to get partnerships and not look at individual contributions... We wouldve been under much pressure had one of us gone soon after Wasim Jaffers dismissal (8 for 1)... I was very pleased for Rahul when he got his 50. 
    
	On whether both he and Dravid suffered a loss in concentration after reaching landmarks 
    
	I wouldnt say a lapse in concentration, rather an error in judgement... One misjudges the line or the length. 
    
	On Dravid having congratulated him emotionally once he got his hundred 
    
	He was very happy for me... I cant recall what he said. 
    
	On whether hed made a conscious effort to counter attack early in the afternoon 
    
	No... I played on the merit of the ball. 
    
	On whether he expects this innings of his to bring him back in the one-day scheme of things 
    
	(Laughs) Am not thinking about it... This Test isnt over and Ill now be concentrating on the second innings... Wont be thinking about the ODIs. 
    
	On the wicket 
    
	Good to bat on... One can play through the line and get value for shots. 
    
	On whether the umpiring howlers put him under more pressure 
    
	You dont think about the things you cant control... You go out and play your best, play the ball on merit. 
    
	On referrals to the third (TV) umpire 
    
	Depends on what the ICC wants... Its good going to the third umpire when theres a doubt. 
    
	On whether batting at No. 3 allows him the freedom to bat in his style instead of worrying about the tail when hes slotted at No. 6 
    
	Sometimes yes... At No. 3, youre setting up the game... At No. 6, youve got to play according to the situation... Theres a huge difference, yes. 
    
	On Dravids innings of 53 
    
	Even though he wasnt timing the ball well at the start, Rahul played a fighting innings and it showed a lot about his character... They bowled well to him, bowled in good areas, but he kept fighting. 
    
	On the game plan after the batsmen failed in both innings at the MCG 
    
	That was a different wicket, the ball wasnt coming on to the bat and shot-making was difficult... At the SCG, one has been able to play ones natural game... At the MCG, we didnt capitalise on the starts... One talked about doing so here. If youve noticed, the Australians field setting has been different... Obviously, theyve got different game plans for different batsmen and in different conditions... Watching the Australians play is a learning experience. 
    
	On his expectations from Sachin Tendulkar, who has a phenomenal average at the SCG 
    
	Hes batting brilliantly, as is Sourav (Ganguly), and if they have a big partnership then we can post a big first innings total and put Australia under pressure. Im sure Sachin will get a double hundred tomorrow. 
    
	On the state of the second Test 
    
	Its balanced well... Its important for Sachin and Sourav to start off on a high tomorrow... 
    
	On whether the poor umpiring could impact negatively on the outcome 
    
	Look, wed like to think positively... 
    
	On which Australian started the sledging 
    
	(Laughs) Nobody did. 
    
	On whether his family (wife Sailaja and toddler-son Sarvajit) were at the SCG 
    
	No... They saw a part of my innings at the hotel and then went sightseeing. 
    
	Finally, on how he intends celebrating 
    
	Quietly, at a friends place.

  - A Telegraph Special 
  -   Riders coach remains unruffled         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            John Buchanan and Shahrukh Khan    
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders coach, John Buchanan, has quite a job on his hands. However, if others in the franchise are tense, after four defeats on the trot, hes quite unruffled. But, then, that has been a Buchanan characteristic.         
	The demand on the coachs time is heavy, but Buchanan managed to speak to The Telegraph in the lead-up to Thursdays Indian Premier League (IPL) face-off against the Bangalore Royal Challengers.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Having been pushed into an unusual corner         
	(Grins) I lost 5 ODIs in succession as the Australia coach... That was in my last season, before the 2007 World Cup! There were probably as many losses on the trot during my time at Middlesex... Could even have been more... Its not a place Id like to reside... Its not something you want to go through but, at the same time, Ive always believed theres a silver lining to every black cloud... In this case, its getting to know the people in the franchise better... When youre not getting the results, it does test everybody and gives a picture of how strong you are. At the moment, Im pleased with the way everybody has responded... One would always like to win, but thats not possible... Getting back to your question, its not an usual feeling.         
	Getting over this unusual feeling         
	Well... Ive got to deal with it myself... Ive got to look at what Im actually trying to achieve... Am I actually trying to achieve things too quickly? Or not too quickly? Ive got to get the balance right... Am I communicating well enough with the players and the (support) staff? Am I giving them the right directions? Are we working hard enough? I guess you go through everything... The technical aspects... You look at the people around you... Indeed, you look at your own emotions... Your expectations... In looking back, whats encouraging is the 104-run sixth-wicket partnership between David Hussey and Wriddhiman Saha in Mohali... It showed what could be achieved by the Knight Riders... And by one of the local players... I cant believe that this franchise wont be successful... The point, of course, is it may not be this year. Were desperately trying to make the semi-finals... Whether we do or not, who knows... At this stage, all I can say is that weve moved from frontrunners to rank outsiders. Eight matches remain... (After a pause) Weve had this discussion before... How do you usually measure success? By results. Having said that, success is also measured by the right process, by having the right people... By striking the right balance between results and the process... I remain immensely confident about this franchise.         
	The difference being made by principal owner Shah Rukh Khan         
	Its because we have somebody as passionate as Shah Rukh that I just cant believe this franchise wont work... Starting from the top, with Shah Rukh, weve got a fantastic mix of people... Shah Rukh is always flooding us with text messages... Winning or losing, he wants us to know that hes there with us... Its not just Shah Rukh, (co-owners) Juhi and Jay Mehta have been as fantastic. The whole entourage, in fact.         
	Having divided his assignment into stages         
	The first stage, in the first year, entails exploration... The players, the staff, the city of Calcutta, the community... Its about exploring everything... Then, comes development in the second year... Obviously, one learns a lot from the first stage and develops from there... The third year is the implementation stage... I expect the franchise to be profitable and the team would by then be playing exceptionally well... Beyond that is what I call capitalisation. Were aiming to be in the front but, at the moment, thats not the reality.         
	If theres a formula to regain momentum         
	Before the IPL began, Id reckoned that round 6 or 7 would give one a clear picture for, by then, the ones who had to leave (like Ricky Ponting) wouldve left and the replacements (Brad Hodge, for example) wouldve settled down... Weve got a handle on the fact that were just outside the top 4... The other night (in Mohali), there were misfields... That showed tension and not trying to do the wrong things as opposed to backing yourself to doing the right things... For the momentum to be regained, each individual has to prepare himself in the best way possible... After that, its about going out and trying to play with the freedom that will allow their skills to come through. Its much easier when youre winning, not so when you arent. The emphasis is on the individuals trying to get back to their (normal) game... Were putting a bit of structure into our game and having stability in the line-up... If it doesnt work, then theres probably little else that can be done in the first year.         
	Whether the Knight Riders strategy at the first auction shouldve been different         
	But all teams have gone through the same thing... Some players leaving after a few matches and others joining the squad... It wouldve been nice if Ponting and Brendon McCullum didnt have to leave... It wouldve been nice if Chris Gayle didnt get injured... But, then, youve got to build a team... Build a franchise... Its important for the players who we see as being a part of the future also being a part of the present...         
	The way forward for the Sourav Gangulys         
	When the going isnt good, theres a tendency to retreat within ones self... Within ones game... In my view, though, thats the time to go out... One shouldnt be retreating... Just staying in the areas that we know hasnt been working... We need to actually expand ourselves a little bit... That needs courage... Leadership... Its not the time to head for safe areas and be isolated... Thats what Ive been trying to emphasise... The players have been responding, but we havent been giving ourselves a chance on the field.         
	Whether theres an appreciable difference when it comes to preparing for Twenty20 cricket         
	Not really... The basics are the same... The players need to know their game and combat situations with not just technical, but mental skills. As Shane Warne put it very well, bowlers construct an over. The batsmen, clearly, need to do likewise.         
	Finally, how much of a role can a coach actually play         
	If people begin to comment on my methodology or style when the going isnt good, then that makes me more determined to get the style and methodology working... Makes me work harder... There are very good people in the franchise and I certainly wont be letting them down. I cant, as Ian Chappell once pointed out, take the catches or score runs on the field... My job is to make sure that the environment is one that the players make good use of... Ive been working very closely with (captain) Sourav and making sure that were on the same track. Also, that when he gets on to the field, everything is as good as it can be... Part of the coachs job is to make sure everyone feels like a member of one big family... One where we applaud each others success and cry for each others lack of success.

	New Delhi: Karan Rastogis campaign in the $15,000 ITF event in Kuwait came to an end on Friday as he conceded his semi-final tie due to a back problem.         
	Fifth-seeded Rastogi was up against sixth seed Australian Miles Armstrong but failed to take the court as his injury flared up again.         
	Rastogi also withdrew from the two $50,000 challenger tournaments, held in the capital last month, again of injury. He would return to the country on Sunday and play ITF future tournament in Iran from June 16.

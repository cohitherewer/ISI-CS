The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Meet shifted to Mumbai 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Meet shifted to Mumbai 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In a move that is sure to disappoint the citys tennis enthusiasts, the fourth edition of the WTA Sunfeast Open  to be held from October 6-12  has been shifted to Mumbai, according to sources.         
	Jaidip Mukerjea, who was the tournament director when the meet was held in the city for the last three years, is yet to be officially informed about the development by organisers Globosport, but for the former Davis Cup captain it hasnt come as a surprise.         
	There were a lot of reasons really why the tournament was shifted, Mukerjea said on Thursday.         
	The WTA had been unhappy with the unavailability of separate practice courts In fact, they had raised objections during the last two years about players practising on the same courts where matches were played         
	Moreover, the fact that the last edition of the WTA Tier III meet was held in a near empty stadium has also contributed a lot towards the move, said the Arjuna award recipient.         
	Globosport was unhappy with the crowd response last year. They also felt that the state association did precious little to whip up enthusiasm for the citys lone glamour tennis event, said Mukerjea.         
	The fact that the tournament dates clash with Durga Puja was the proverbial last straw, he said.         
	We also became the victim of an unfortunate circumstance This being the Olympic year, there will be a two-week gap in the WTA calendar. Subsequently, all the tournaments after the Beijing Olympics have been pushed back by a couple of weeks         
	As it happens, the Sunfeast Open dates have clashed with Durga Puja and the organisers felt it would be very tough to get police clearance during the meet, Mukerjea said.         
	Globosport chief Mahesh Bhupathi has still not got in touch with him, Mukerjea said.

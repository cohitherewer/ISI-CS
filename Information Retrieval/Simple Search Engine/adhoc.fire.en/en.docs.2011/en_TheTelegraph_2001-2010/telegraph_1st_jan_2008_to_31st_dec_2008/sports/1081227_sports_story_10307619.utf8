The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rahil hits 69 to wrest lead
                                                                                                                                                                                             Rahil hits 69 to wrest lead
                  Rahil Gangjee                     
	Greater Noida: Rahil Gangjee brought home a three-under 69 to grab the early second round lead just in time before fading light left Jeev Milkha Singh and 57 other golfers with unfinished business at the midway stage of the BILT Open here on Friday.         
	Overnight leader Anirban Lahiri was three-under for the day with eight more holes to go and Jeev, who had carded 67 on Thursday, was three-under and would return on Saturday to complete his back nine.         
	Mandeo Singh Pathania (140) occupied the second spot after carding 69, one stroke ahead of Harendra Gupta who returned a level-par card on Friday.         
	Once play got off after a delayed start owing to the morning fog, Gangjee made the most of conditions and sank as many as four birdies against a lone bogey to take his tally to nine-under 135 and set up a five-stroke lead over 60 golfers who completed the round.         
	Things could have been better for the 10th tee starter but Gangjee missed quite a few birdie opportunities and had to settle for pars in the first four holes.         
	To make it worse, his tee shot landed in a bunker, eventually costing him a bogey. Gangjee then made amends and sank a birdie in the 18th hole to take the turn at level-par.         
	On resumption, the Calcutta pro raised his game and picked up three more birdies at the second, fifth and seventh hole to finish a satisfying round.         
	I started off normally and it was in expected lines. The wind was in the opposite direction and I was finding it difficult while playing my back nine, although fog was not a problem.         
	There are no major hazards here. If one stays away from the fairway bunkers, it would not be very difficult to hit a low score on this course, he said.         
	In contrast, Jeev had a brilliant birdie-birdie start and the Chandigarh golfer picked up another shot on the fourth hole before stumbling on the sixth.         
	The Asian tour number one hit the bunkers a couple of times but made good come backs, except on the sixth hole where he dropped a bogey  the lone blemish in his otherwise clean slate.         
	Jeev, however, ended the day on a high, picking up another shot at the eighth hole and parred the ninth before bad light stopped play.         
	Anirban Lahiri also looked in nick as the Bangalore pro birdied the 12th, 15th, 16th and the first hole against a bogey in the 13th hole.         
	Shamim Khan and Jyoti Randhawa, who scored 67 and 68 on Thursday respectively, were one-under after completion of eight holes in their back nine.         
	Meanwhile, after a brilliant 68 in the first round, Mohd Siddikur Rahman of Bangladesh had a disappointing outing, turning in a one-over 73 in the second round.

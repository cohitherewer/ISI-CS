                                                   Jitender in quarters
                      
	New Delhi: Jitender Kumar stunned former world championship bronze medallist Nauman Karim of Pakistan to advance to the quarter finals of the light-flyweight category at the second Asian Olympic boxing qualifiers in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Tuesday.         
	The Haryana boxer beat Karim, who won the bronze in 2003, on points in a bout marred by a computer failure that necessitated manual scoring. Jitender trailed 4-6 in the first round before fighting back to 17-9 by the end of the third round. He was declared the winner but the jury did not announce the final score.         
	The rest of the Indians in the fray also got first-round byes. They are: Manoj Kumar (64kg), Dilbag Singh (69kg), Vijender (75kg), Dinesh Kumar (81kg) and Praveen Kumar (+91kg).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | World body conspired against India
                                                   World body conspired against India

	It was a painful homecoming for the team and I feel sorry for the boys. The teams failure to qualify for the Olympics evoked strong reactions in the country and it is now very important to support the players.         
	The last few days have given me time to ponder about what went wrong in Santiago and I feel that we could have still made it to Beijing if the umpiring was not biased.         
	We were not allowed to play our natural game in the final match against Britain by the umpires and the tournament director. There was a discreet conspiracy by the Fih and Britain.         
	In our league match against Britain, we received two yellow cards without reason. But the British got away scot free.         
	Tushar Khandekar was hooked in the penalty area and floored. No stroke was given, which we deserved. Vikram Khan getting a yellow card was justified. But the British player, who was also involved in the incident, was given a warning.         
	Shivendra Singh was given a yellow card when he slipped. The British player had hooked Shivendra and no penalty was awarded or a card given to him. The incident was viewed on the video after the match and the umpires blunder was accepted by the tournament director. But then, India paid a heavy price for these lapses.

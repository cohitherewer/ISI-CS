            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: East Bengals efforts to secure the release of Ghanaian striker Yusuf Yakubu from Salgaocar Sports Club did not bear fruit for the second day running on Wednesday.         
	While the East Bengal official, who is currently camping in Goa, requested his Salgaocar counterparts to settle for a negotiable amount, the Goan club remained adamant on getting an additional Rs 10 lakh for clearing the African goalscorer.         
	East Bengal have already offered to return the amount of Rs 10 lakhs that Yakubu accepted from Salgaocar as an advance at the start of the season.         
	The Goan club official, however, said the Calcutta club should pay another Rs 10 lakh as compensation.         
	The officials of the two teams are likely to meet again on Thursday for another round of talks.

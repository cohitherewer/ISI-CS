The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rafa has mental edge: Borg
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rafa has mental edge: Borg
            Mark Hodgkinson in Paris            Bjorn Borg                           
	Bjorn Borg, the Swede with red dirt on his socks and blue ice in his veins, was the Viking God of Clay in the Seventies and early Eighties. He won six French Open titles, including a record four in a row. Everybody says that when Borg went on court, no one thought he was going to lose, the Spaniard Rafael Nadal noted.         
	The Ice Borg has not been seen at Roland Garros in years, but next week he is scheduled to return to Paris, intrigued to discover whether Nadal can emulate him and become only the second man in history to win the Coupe des Mousquetaires four years in succession. Many in tennis still believe Borg is the greatest clay-court player of modern times, perhaps of all time, but now a debate has begun over whether he has been biffed aside by the Nadal biceps. Borg is travelling to the French capital to see for himself at close quarters what this Nadal is all about on the terre battue.         
	On a soggy, irritating day at Roland Garros, where a pair of galoshes would have been more useful than clay court training shoes, it was after 7.30 pm on Tuesday night when Nadal, in a neon green muscle-vest, began his opening-round match against Brazils Thomaz Bellucci, and they completed just two games before being chased off by the rain. A week from Sunday, Borg wants to settle into his seat on the Philippe Chatrier Court and watch Nadal play Roger Federer for the cup. If Nadal wins the title again, and equals my record, then I will be the first to congratulate him. Records are there to be equalled and broken, so I would be happy for Rafa to do it, Borg told The Daily Telegraph.         
	I havent been to Roland Garros for many years, and cant even remember when I was last there, but I thought that it was time for me to come back to the place where I have such happy memories. Roland Garros has a special place in my heart. Im looking forward to being at Roland Garros as a spectator, and I would very much like to see Roger and Rafa play in the final, said Borg, who won back-to-back titles in 1974 and 1975, and then his unbroken four, from 1978 to 1981.         
	This has become a recent trend, Borg travelling to grand slams with the prospect of a record run being equalled. At Wimbledon last summer, he sat in the Royal Box on Centre Court and watched as Federer matched his mark of five golden trophies in a row. Borg, though, believes that Federer will do extremely well to dump Nadal on to the baseline dust.         
	I know that Roger wants to win the French Open so badly, Borg said. But he probably has two or three good chances left to win. I think that Roger has a chance to win the French Open this year, and I would be very happy if he wins, too, but he would have to play the match of his life if he is going to beat Rafa over five sets in the final.         
	I believe Rafa is getting stronger and stronger on clay, as he is becoming more and more experienced, and he is moving so well on the court, and playing such great groundstrokes. He is playing with a lot of confidence. I dont think Ive ever seen Rafa play a bad match on a clay court. He is so consistent. Beating him over five sets on clay is so tough.         
	Borg applauded Nadals mental edge. Rafa knows that he doesnt play bad matches on clay. Paris is the toughest grand slam tournament to win, mentally and physically, and Rafa walks out on court with the feeling that he already has a mental advantage over his opponent. His record is a negative thought for his opponents, though, as they realise that they are going to have play the best tennis of their life to have any chance of beating him. Rafa is definitely the strong favourite to win again, you have to say that. But Roger and Novak Djokovic still have a chance against him. If Rafa doesnt win this year, he is going to go on to win many more French Open titles, as he is only young, and has a lot of time left.         
	And what were Borgs thoughts on who is the greatest clay-court player in history?         
	I know that if Rafa wins people are going to want to compare him to me, and talk about who was the greatest player on clay. But I think thats difficult to say, as its difficult to compare two players from different eras. I am very happy with what I achieved at Roland Garros, and I think Rafa is a great champion, an unbelievable clay court player.

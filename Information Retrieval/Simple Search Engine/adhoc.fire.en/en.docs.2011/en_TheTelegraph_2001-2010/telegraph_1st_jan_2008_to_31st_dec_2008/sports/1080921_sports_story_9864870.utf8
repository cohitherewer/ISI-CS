The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Penalise Aussies: Inzamam
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Penalise Aussies: Inzamam
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq lashed out at the International Cricket Council (ICC) for being a mute spectator to Australias double standards on security.         
	Inzamam felt Australia should be penalised for refusing to tour Pakistan on security grounds while agreeing to play in India despite serial blasts.         
	Australia has been the only country which has refused to tour Pakistan steadfastly. And I dont think this is going to change unless other cricket boards and the ICC do something about it, Inzamam said.         
	The burly right-hander, who is currently with the rebel Indian Cricket League, said the ICCs inaction is the only reason why Aussies have brazenly violated tour commitments in Pakistan.         
	I would think the ICC must take the blame for not being strong enough in reigning in sides that continue to pick and choose their tours, Inzamam said.         
	What message have Australia sent out to us or the rest of the cricketing world by agreeing to play in India although they have also had terrorist bomb blasts there in cities where the Australians play Test matches? he asked.

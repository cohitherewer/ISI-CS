	ECB willing to proceed with League  London: Durham and Kent may be able to participate in the Champions League in October despite fielding players from the ldquo;rebel rdquo; Indian Cricket League (ICL) on Saturday. The ECB, driving a reworked model, believes that a compromise can be reached, says a report in The Times. The halfway house, which has been glaringly obvious all along, would allow counties to compete in the lucrative event but without their ICL players mdash; Dale Benkenstein, of Durham, and the Kent pair of Justin Kemp and Azhar Mahmood. The ECB is still keen to have India on board for the inaugural Champions League because the event would be devalued without its best teams. But the ECB is clear that Lalit Modi, the IPL commissioner, cannot be allowed to dictate terms over issues such as ICL involvement.    
	 Clarification  Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Friday dismissed reports of delaying in recommending Team India ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni for Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award and said the application was sent well before the deadline. ldquo;The BCCI had sent the following completed applications for the government awards by speed post from the Mumbai office on 27th May 2008, rdquo; BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said in a statement, says A Staff Reporter.     
	 BCCI angry  New Delhi: The BCCI has reacted angrily to ICC general manager Dave Richardson rsquo;s remarks that the IPL poses a serious corruption threat and has shot off a letter to CEO Haroon Lorgat to protest for ldquo;unnecessarily raking up the issue rdquo;. Soon after Richardson rsquo;s statement that the ldquo;ICC was concerned rdquo; about the risk of corruption that the IPL poses because of the huge money on offer to the players, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah shot off an email to Lorgat pointing out the comprehensive anti-corruption measures put in place by the IPL.    
	 Johnson move  Sydney: Australian paceman Mitchell Johnson will leave Queensland to play for Western Australia in next season rsquo;s Sheffield Shield and one-day competitions, the Western Australian Cricket Association said on Friday.

	 Steyn out  Calcutta: South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn will miss the third Test with a broken left thumb, and is doubtful for the fourth Test against England, according to a CSA release on Friday.

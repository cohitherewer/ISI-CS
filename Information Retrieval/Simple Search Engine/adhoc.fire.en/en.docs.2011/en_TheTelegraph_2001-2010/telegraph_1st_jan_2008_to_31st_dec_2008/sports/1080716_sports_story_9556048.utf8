The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No surprises in US athletics squad
                                                                                                                                                                                                       No surprises in US athletics squad

	New York: An experienced athletics team featuring seven current world champions and a host of medals favourites will represent the United States in next months Beijing Olympics, USA Track amp; Field announced on Monday.         
	The 126-member squad includes Athens 2004 Olympic gold medallists Jeremy Wariner (400m) and Shawn Crawford (200m), double world champions Tyson Gay and Bernard Lagat and individual world winners Wariner, Allyson Felix (womens 200m), Brad Walker (pole vault), Reese Hoffa (shot put) and Kerron Clement (400m hurdles).         
	Collectively, the team has 15 Olympic medallists, 31 world championships medallist and 10 US record holders.         
	The latter includes javelin thrower Breaux Greer who was added to the team under a USATF rule that allows the selection of an injured athlete who competed in the US Olympic Trials but did not reach the final and has the qualifying standard. Greer, who has a shoulder injury, finished 17th in qualifying.         
	USATF president Bill Roe called the squad one of the United States best.         
	The United States won 25 athletics medals at the 2004 Athens Games, eight of them gold. It had a championships-high 26 medals at the 2007 worlds, including 14 golds.         
	Greer hurt his shoulder while winning a bronze medal at last years world championships and hadnt thrown in competition until July 4 at the Olympic trials. The mens javelin competition in Beijing begins August 20. Will he be ready for the games? I dont know. His agent and his doctor seem to think so, said John Chaplin, the chair of US mens track and field.         
	Chaplin said Greers agent submitted an injury appeal. Only two other male javelin throwers from the United States, Leigh Smith and Mike Hazle, had met the Olympic A qualifying standard. If Greer had not been added to the roster, the U.S. would have been using only two of its allotted three places. Only Greer could have taken the third spot.         
	Since hes the only 300-foot thrower weve got, and theyre saying that its repaired, and hell be ready, I figured its a very good gamble, quot; Chaplin said. (Agencies)

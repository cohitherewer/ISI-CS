The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis urges India to tour Pakistan
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Younis urges India to tour Pakistan
                      
	Karachi: Senior batsman Younis Khan on Monday urged India to put aside security apprehensions and go ahead with their tour of Pakistan scheduled early next year.         
	Younis said most countries are grappling with security issues and India needed to support Pakistan cricket by going ahead with the tour, featuring three Tests, five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 game.         
	The security situation globally is a problem but life goes on and I would urge India to tour Pakistan, Younis said. As a player I would love to play India in my country and I would definitely like the series to go ahead on schedule.         
	India have still not confirmed the tour, starting from January 4, as they are awaiting clearance from their government, which is reviewing the security situation in Pakistan.         
	Younis said he was confident that the series would take place and fans in the sub-continent would get to see a good contest featuring the traditional rivals. Younis, in fact, went on to say that though India were in scintillating form, Pakistan would prove equally tough when they lock horns.         
	India might be doing well against other teams but I know as a player, when they play Pakistan, it is different, and our players also rise above themselves to do well. England beat Australia in 2005 but when they came to Pakistan they lost the Test and one-day series, he said.         
	Meanwhile, the senior batsman backed the formation of a players association for Pakistan cricket. There is a need to have a registered players association in Pakistan as this would go a long way in resolving problems faced by players, Younis said.         
	Recently, Pakistan vice-captain Misbah-ul Haq sent a paper to the constitution committee of the sports ministry, asking them to include clauses in the constitution which allow and recognise a players association.

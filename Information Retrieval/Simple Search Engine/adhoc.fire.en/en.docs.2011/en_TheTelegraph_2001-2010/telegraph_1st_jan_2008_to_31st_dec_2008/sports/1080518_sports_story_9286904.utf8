The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kings XI Punjab clinch rain-marred tie
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kings XI Punjab clinch rain-marred tie
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: First it rained fours and sixes from Virender Sehwags blade. Then elements took over to drop temporary curtains on the proceedings for nearly two hours to reduce the tie to a truncated 11 over-a-side affair.         
	In the end, the crucial encounter between Delhi DareDevils and Punjab Kings XI that was marred by rain, chaos and confusion was decided by the Duckworth-Lewis method with the visitors winning by six runs to take their points tally to 14 from 10 matches. They stay in second spot.Delhi DareDevils, placed fifth have 10 from 11 games.         
	The match, which had several interruptions because of consistent rain, was first stopped at 9pm when Delhi were 94 for 1 in 8.1 overs. As the capacity crowd at the Kotla sat through patiently, the match could only be resumed at 11pm and the two umpires AV Jayaprakash and Rudy Koertzen were forced to make it a 11-over affair.         
	After Delhi notched up 118 for four, Punjab couldnt take their reply beyond 94 for 3 in eight overs as rain stopped play again.         
	Thankfully for Kings XI, the Duckworth-Lewis method ruled in favour of the visiting side, who were found six runs ahead of the hosts at that stage. It took quite some time for the organisers to announce the result of the tie.         
	Punjab must thank two of their middle order batsmen  Luke Pomersbach and Mahela Jaywardene  who steered the team to victory after they were reduced to 31 for three in 3.3 overs. While the Australian remained unbeaten on 25 off just 12 deliveries, the Sri Lankan hit three sixes to score 36 in 17 balls.         
	Rain played spoilsport at the most inappropriate time when Sehwag was at his entertaining best with the bat.         
	After initial hesitations, when he was giving more strike to his left handed partner Gautam Gambhir, Sehwag (51 not out) launched into a lethal attack that had Punjab bowlers running for cover. The Delhi opener hit five towering sixes and looked unstoppable when steady rain stopped play after 8.1 overs.         
	If there was a sense of dejection in the DareDevils dressing room when rain intervened, that was clearly justified. With the opening partnership of Gambhir (40) and Sehwag yielding 75 runs in seven overs and the latter going great guns on 47 from 19 deliveries.         
	Kings XI Punjab on the other hand, were certainly a relieved lot. They paid heavily for two dropped catches in the third over and didnt know how to stop Sehwag.

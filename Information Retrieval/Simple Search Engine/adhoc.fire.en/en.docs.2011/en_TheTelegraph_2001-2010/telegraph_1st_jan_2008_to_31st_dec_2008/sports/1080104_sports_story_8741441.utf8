      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Sydney: The touring Indian cricketers have expressed disappointment that some of the umpiring decisions could have an impact on the outcome of the second Test. 
    
	This was conveyed to the media late on Thursday. 
    
	No protest is being lodged but, as reported by The Telegraph on Thursday, the multiple goof-ups will be commented upon in captain Anil Kumbles report to the International Cricket Council. 
    
	Meanwhile, injured spearhead Zaheer Khan leaves for home on Friday. His replacement, Vikram Rajvir Singh, is expected on Saturday. 
    
	Zaheer requires rest for between four to six weeks.

	Stuttgart: Lewis Hamilton celebrated his 23rd birthday on Monday by showing off the car that McLaren hope will take him to the Formula One title as the youngest champion this season. 
    
	The Briton, runner-up last year in an astonishing rookie season in which he lost out by a single point to Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen in the final race, said he was more determined and hungrier than ever. 
    
	I honestly feel stronger, he told reporters after the MP4-23 car had been rolled out at the Mercedes museum in Stuttgart, with Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone taking a front row seat. 
    
	I feel great right now. Ive done a lot of really good preparation already, way before the first test even, and I just believe that its a fresh start for us all, turning over a new leaf, added Hamilton. 
    
	With the experience of last year I feel even stronger than I was. I cant wait to get back into the car and Im extremely excited about the first race. 
    
	Hamiltons debut proved the highlight of a traumatic year for McLaren, who were fined $100 million and stripped of all their constructors points for a spying controversy over leaked Ferrari data. 
    
	The Briton reeled off nine podium finishes in succession at the beginning of the year, unprecedented for a rookie, and took four wins from his 17 starts. 
    
	Now cast as team leader on the track after the departure of Spains unhappy double world champion Fernando Alonso back to Renault, Hamilton said he would take the same approach to his racing as last year. 
    
	Fingers crossed, but with the same sort of mentality and determination I think we can do well, he said. 
    
	I thoroughly enjoyed last year, just the whole year. It was just the best year of my life but I know it can be better. 
    
	Hamilton has a new team mate, Heikki Kovalainen, the Finn whose place at Renault was taken by Alonso and who joins McLaren with an assurance of equal treatment. 
    
	I would not have come to the team if I did not think I had an equal chance to fight, he told reporters. 
    
	I have exactly the same opportunity as Lewis has and then its up to me. 
    
	The launch was low on fanfare, a marked contrast to the circus and fireworks that followed last years floodlit street racing extravaganza in Valencia, and represented a return to fundamentals. 
    
	Stuttgart, home of the teams 40 percent stakeholders and engine partners Mercedes, was chosen as launch venue for the first time in what some saw as a sign of the changing balance of power within the team. 
    
	McLaren are at a clear advantage this year because they built the electronic system which all Formula One teams must now use, Ferrari chief executive Jean Todt said on Monday. 
    
	The SECU (Standard Electronic Control Unit) produced by McLaren Electronic Systems is a major development for the new season, which starts on March 16 in Melbourne. 
    
	We would have preferred that the single control unit for all Formula One teams was built by another company. We must accept the fact that McLaren with Microsoft put forward the most economic proposal, Todt told reporters in Milan. 
    
	It is clear it is a situation to monitor. But it is obvious that, at least at the start, McLaren will have an advantage in the championship, added the Frenchman, who has handed the reins of the racing team to Stefano Domenicali while he remains boss of the company. 
    
	The new Ferrari F2008 car was given its first run out by Kimi Raikkonen at the teams Maranello base on Monday with the Finn managing 20 odd laps without any problems. 
    
	The track was slightly damp and provided an early challenge for Raikkonen given Formula One cars have no traction control this season.

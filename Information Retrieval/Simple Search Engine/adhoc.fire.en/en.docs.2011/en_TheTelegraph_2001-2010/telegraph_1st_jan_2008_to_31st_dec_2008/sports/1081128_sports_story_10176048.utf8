	Calcutta/Mumbai: Bhaichung Bhutia had a narrow escape on Wednesday. He was staying at the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, one of the scenes of terrorist activities, and checked out around 3 pm.         
	I was in Mumbai in connection with the Tata Tea Arsenal football tournament and was staying at the Taj. I came back long before it all started, said Bhutia on Thursday.         
	The firing and hostage crisis started around 10 pm on Wednesday. Amid the tragic events in Mumbai, there is some good news Bhutia had left the Taj a few hours before it all started, Sourav Ganguly said during a felicitation at Bhowanipore club.         
	The JCT football team, however, had an eerie experience when they were stranded on the road for 15-20 minutes in south Mumbai during the time of the attacks.         
	The JCT players, who were in Mumbai for an I-League match, were staying at Hotel Celest in Colaba, a few hundred yards away from the Taj.         
	The players had gone to a nearby restaurant for dinner, and were on their way back to the hotel when they heard gunshots. The players became a bit anxious as they saw commotion on the streets. But the situation lasted only for a brief period before they returned to the safety of their hotel rooms.

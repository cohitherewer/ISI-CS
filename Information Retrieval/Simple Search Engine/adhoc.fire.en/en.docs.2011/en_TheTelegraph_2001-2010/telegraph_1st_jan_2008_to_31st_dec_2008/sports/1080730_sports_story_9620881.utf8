            STAR RACER                                      
	Calcutta: Trainer Daniel Davids prized horse Star Team is fancied to lift the 1,400m Supernova Cup, the main attraction in Wednesdays seven-event card. The last winters 2,000 Guineas winner is up against a strong western India contingent but the horse, by Alnasr Alwasheek-Pleasures, has been judiciously prepared to tackle the four intruders who may be targeting the glamourous events which may follow later in the season. Jockey A. Imran Khan partners Star Team.          
	The 1,400m La Gitana Cup may see trainer Vijay Singhs sparingly raced colt Silver Fox in the winners enclosure. The Elusive Pimpernel-Silver Reflet son had reeled off three wins in as many outings last winter. His morning workouts indicate the horse may do the trick again in the hands of jockey C. Alford.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

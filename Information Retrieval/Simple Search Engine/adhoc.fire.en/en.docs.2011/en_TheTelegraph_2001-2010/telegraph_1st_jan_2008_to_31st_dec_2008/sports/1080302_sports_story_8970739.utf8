            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengals supporters came down heavily on the players, forcing them to leave the Barasat stadium under police protection on Saturday.         
	Soon after the loss to Mahindra United, the supporters attempted to gatecrash into the dressing room. When the police intervened, they expressed their frustration by shattering the glass panes at the main gate.         
	They also pelted the two team buses before the police took control of the situation.         
	There was just a days gap between our Super Cup clash against Dempo and this match. We barely had any time to rest, said East Bengal goalkeeper Subrata Paul.         
	Interim coach Aloke Mukherjee cursed ill luck for the defeat. We started brilliantly had we converted some of those chances, things could have been different, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Churchil Brothers all but ensured themselves of a last-four berth after being held to a goalless draw by Mohammedan Sporting of Dhaka at the Howrah stadium.

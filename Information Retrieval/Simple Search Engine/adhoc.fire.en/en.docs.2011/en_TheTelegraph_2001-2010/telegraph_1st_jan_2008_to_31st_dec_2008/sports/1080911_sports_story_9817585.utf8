The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer adds emotion to flavour 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Federer adds emotion to flavour 
    - Five-time US Open winner brightens up the game by becoming less predictable           Mark Hodgkinson            Roger Federer                                 
	New York: So many of Roger Federers 13 Grand Slam trophies had been presented as the smooth work of a genius, as if there were nothing simpler in the world for the Swiss than easing through a draw-sheet.         
	However, his latest triumph was not quite like that. While Federer winning a fifth consecutive US Open title could never be seen as a shock result, he felt as though this Slam title had a different flavour. And New York clearly savoured that different flavour here was something new in the Federer narrative.         
	Perhaps the tennis public had previously started to take Federer a bit for granted, believing that his Slam victories had become almost too easy. His tennis at the start of this year was complicated by a bout of glandular fever, he lost in the semi finals at the Australian Open to Novak Djokovic, and then finished as the runner-up to Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. The top ranking switched to the Majorcan over the summer.         
	Arriving in New York, nothing had been easy, and there is nothing they like more in the Big Apple than some drama, some emotion, a good story. Federers story was certainly that. It had lost its predictability, which is always the last thing that a good story needs.         
	 At the start of the season, it had looked as though Federer was poised to break that record in 2008. The public never grew bored with Federers dominance, as they were by Michael Schumacher behind a steering wheel, but his pursuit of Sampras was seen as a fait accompli. Federers struggles this season have shown that he cannot always have everything his own way, and that has reinvigorated tennis. The sport is no longer about Federer and then the rest.         
	If Federer had lost to Murray, his season would have looked very different. I would have been disappointed losing to Andy as that would have been losing three finals and one semi-final in the slams, Federer said.         
	Its all about the wins, and thats why this is huge. This is massive. Im very happy about this grand slam obviously. It has a different type of flavour, this one to me.         
	This was about more than Federer becoming the first man since American Bill Tilden in 1924 to win a fifth consecutive US Open title, or the first in history to win two different Slams five times in succession; this was about Federer getting his career back on course.

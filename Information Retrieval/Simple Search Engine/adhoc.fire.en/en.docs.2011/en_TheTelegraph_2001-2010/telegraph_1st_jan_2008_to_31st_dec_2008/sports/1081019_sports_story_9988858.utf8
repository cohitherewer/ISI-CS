The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea win big at Boro
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chelsea win big at Boro
                      
	London: Chelsea romped to a 5-0 victory at Middlesbrough on Saturday while Liverpool and Arsenal produced stirring fightbacks to claim home wins over Wigan Athletic and Everton.         
	Arsenal moved to third on 16 points after netting three second-half goals to record a 3-1 victory against Everton.         
	Aston Villa are fourth on 14 after drawing 0-0 at home to Portsmouth.         
	Chelsea travelled to Middlesbrough shorn of several injured regulars but went ahead through Salomon Kalou after 14 minutes.         
	Their dominance bore fruit with four goals in 16 minutes early in the second half, starting with another stunning 30-metre shot by Brazilian Juliano Belletti. A second for Kalou and goals by Frank Lampard and Florent Malouda secured Chelseas best away win in the league for five years.         
	Egyptian striker Amr Zaki scored twice, including a superb scissor kick, as Wigan outplayed Liverpool in the first half to lead 2-1 after Dirk Kuyt had replied for the hosts.         
	Wigan received a big blow when Antonio Valencia was sent off 15 minutes from time and Liverpool piled on the pressure, culminating in Albert Rieras equaliser and Kuyts miss-hit winner with five minutes left.         
	Arsenal fell behind against Everton following an early Leon Osman goal.         
	But the second-half introduction of England winger Theo Walcott changed the game and goals from Samir Nasri, Robin van Persie and Walcott turned things round.           (REUTERS)

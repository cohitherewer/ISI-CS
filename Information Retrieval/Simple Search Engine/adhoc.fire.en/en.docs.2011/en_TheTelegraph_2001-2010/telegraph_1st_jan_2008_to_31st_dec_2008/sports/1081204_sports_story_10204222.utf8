The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Daunting task for Hyderabad 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Daunting task for Hyderabad 
                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai amassed a mammoth first innings total of 602 for six declared and then took two early Hyderabad wickets before the visitors recovered poise on the second day of the four-day Ranji Trophy Elite Division Group A match here Wednesday.         
	At stumps, Hyderabad were 82 for two, still 520 runs behind Mumbai.         
	At the crease with a stand of 76 in 19.5 overs were opener T. Suman (40 in 90 balls with two sixes and three fours) and left-hander Anoop Pai, who quickly got into the groove to be unbeaten on 35 in 59 balls with eight fours.         
	The Mumbai total, their third highest against Hyderabad in the national championship, was built around skipper Wasim Jaffers marathon innings of 256 and his record 335-run stand for the second wicket with one-down Ajinkya Rahane (137).         
	Hyderabad snapped up five Mumbai wickets as the hosts slumped from the overnight 366 for one to 486 for six, before Ajit Agarkar used the long handle to clout five sixes and two fours in a whirlwind, unbeaten knock of 77 off 112 balls.         
	Agarkar and Sairaj Bahutule, unbeaten on 40, took the Mumbai total past the 600 mark with an unfinished seventh-wicket stand of 116 runs in 33.5 overs before Jaffer declared the Mumbai innings closed 22 minutes before tea.         
	For Hyderabad medium pacer M.P. Arjun stole the bowling honours. He grabbed 4 wickets for 99 runs, taking three wickets for 32 runs in two spells lasting nine overs in all.         
	The visitors started their reply by losing opener D. Ravi Teja for a duck and one-down Rushi Raj (2) with only six runs on the board before Suman and Pai who played attractive shots, steadied ship.         
	Hyderabads hopes soared in the morning when Ashwin Yadav had Rahane caught behind off the first ball he faced. He did not add to his overnight score and the home teams total had advanced by only seven runs.         
	Arjun got rid off Amol Muzumdar (15), caught at square leg, to reduce the home team to 398 for three before Jaffer and Rohit Sharma stemmed the rot.         
	BRIEF SCORES:         
	Mumbai: 602/6 decl. (W. Jaffer 256, A. Rahane 137; M.P. Arjun 4/99) vs Hyderabad 82/2 (T. Suman 40 batting). Match to continue.           (PTI)

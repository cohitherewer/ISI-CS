The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shane wants intense battle sans scandal
                                                                                                                                                                                             Shane wants intense battle sans scandal
                  Shane Watson                     
	Jaipur: The Sydney fiasco might be still afresh in the minds of the cricketing fraternity, but all-rounder Shane Watson on Thursday said he would look forward to a contest like that in the upcoming four-match Test series against India beginning October 9, not for the monkey-gate incident but for the closely-fought affair.         
	The rivalry between India and Australia has become so intense in recent years. It has become the biggest challenge for Australian cricketers to play and win a series against India. It was amazing for a Test match to be decided in the last 20 minutes of the fifth day, he said referring to the Sydney Test earlier this year though without mentioning it by name.         
	Indian lower order batsmen had failed to negotiate Australian bowlers in the last 30 minutes of the second Test that was remembered more for the monkey-gate scandal than for the on-field intensity.         
	I hope this series will have intense competitions like that which go down the wire, he said.         
	Asked why the Australians, known for playing mind games before important series, have been quite and calm in the build up to the India tour, Watson said it was not a conscious strategy.         
	Not sure. The calm atmosphere is a part of the team strategy. We are focused and looking forward to the series, strategising and formulating our game plan. For every one of us it is the biggest test to play and win a series in India physically, mentally and technically, Watson said after his teams three-hour practice session at the Rajasthan Cricket Associations Future Cricket Academy grounds here.         
	Watson would not pass judgement whether their rivalry with India has surpassed the Ashes, saying the two competitions are played on totally different conditions. The rivalry with India has become really big but both this and the Ashes are different challenges.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachins fitness worries Indians
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sachins fitness worries Indians
                      
	Mumbai: After the mauling they received from Kolkata Knight Riders in the opening match of the Indian Premier League, Bangalores Royal Challengers would be eager to set things right when they take on hosts Mumbai Indians in their second clash at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.         
	Bangalore captain Rahul Dravid, after a 140-run loss Friday, must ensure not to allow a repeat of the carnage at the hands of Sri Lankan marauder Sanath Jayasuriya, who is bound to open the innings with captain Sachin Tendulkar if the Mumbai batsman regains full fitness from his groin injury.         
	New Zealand wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum had taken away the game by carting around the inexperienced Praveen Kumar, the rusty Zaheer Khan back in action after being laid low by his ankle injury for more than three months and young Aussie Ashley Noffke during his pulverising 158 not out.         
	If bowling appeared to be the weak link in the visiting teams armour, their batting too was under question in the 223-run chase despite the presence of Dravid, and South Africans Jacques Kallis and Mark Boucher.         
	As far as the Reliance Industries-owned Mumbai team is concerned, their biggest worry is the fitness of Tendulkar.         
	There are still a day to go and a decision will be taken whether I will play or not will be taken just before the match, Tendulkar said when the 27-strong team was launched at a function here on Thursday.         
	In case, Tendulkar fails to pass the fitness test, off-spinner and vice-captain Harbhajan Singh will take over the reins. He would be expected to bring the aggressiveness he displays on the field to the captaincy stakes too.         
	Even as Tendulkars fitness remains an issue, the team, with as many as 27 playing members on its rolls, has been going about its task of gearing up with confidence.         
	They have three wicketkeepers, including Luke Ronchi of Western Australia  a hard-hitting bastman yet to play for his country in any form.         
	Going by the practice sessions, he seems to be the first choice ahead of two other younger Indians  Pinal Shah and Yogesh Takawale  both of whom can hit the ball powerfully.         
	Among the key players in the team are Harbhajan and former South African captain Shaun Pollock. Pollock has just retired from international cricket and can be miserly with the ball and extremely handy lower down with the bat.         
	The same holds good for Harbhajan who would be a very crucial bowling arm of the team in the middle of the innings with his ability to check runs as well as take wickets.

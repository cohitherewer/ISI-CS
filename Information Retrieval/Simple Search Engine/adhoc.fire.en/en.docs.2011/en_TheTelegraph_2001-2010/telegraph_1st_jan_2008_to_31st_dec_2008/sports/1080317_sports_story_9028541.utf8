The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ecclestone absence raises questions
                                                   Ecclestone absence raises questions
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Melbourne: Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestones non-appearance at the season opening Australian Grand Prix has raised quite a few eyebrows. Many feel he has made a quiet statement through his absence.         
	Ecclestone has threatened to cancel the race from the schedule in 2010 unless organisers agree to stage it under lights to suit European TV needs.         
	In a bid to save the event and lure more viewers around the world, the Melbourne Grand Prix could be run at twilight from next year.         
	The 5pm start time is being seen as a compromise between the current afternoon start and the night event sought by Ecclestone. Sunday saw a shift from 2 to 3.30pm to bolster viewers. An operating loss of up to $40 million is forecast for this years race.         
	Australian Grand Prix Corporation chairman Ron Walker has said that if international television audience figures showed that the change was successful in attracting more viewers, the race start time would be moved even later for 2009.         
	The Victoria state government says it has ruled out a night race, and a floodlit F1 was unsuitable for Albert Park. The Australian Grand Prix moved from Adelaide to Melbourne in 1995.         
	The inaugural Singapore event this September will become F1s first night-time race.

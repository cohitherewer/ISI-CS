                                                ICC to analyse Marlon action
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The ICC on Wednesday announced that West Indies Marlon Samuels will undergo an independent analysis of his bowling action at the National Cricket Academy at Loughborough University in England on Monday.         
	The analysis will be performed by Dr Mark King, member of the ICC Panel of Human Movement Specialists.         
	Samuels was reported for suspected illegal bowling action by on-field umpires Simon Taufel and Aleem Dar and third umpire Brian Jerling after the third Test between South Africa and the West Indies in Durban from January 10-12.         
	Within 14 days of the independent analysis, the appointed specialist will supply the ICC with a written report advising the outcome of the bio-mechanical assessment. This will confirm whether the action used was legal or illegal.         
	Although only his fast deliveries have been reported as suspect, the ICC process requires his action generally, including the fast deliveries, to be analysed.

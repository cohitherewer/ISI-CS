                                                  Hayden: Theres no free lunch in Tests 
  - Sachins quite far ahead... I will take the hundreds one at a time       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Matthew Hayden                                 
	Adelaide: The difference that Matthew Hayden makes to the Australian line-up was evident once more, on Saturday, when he celebrated his comeback (after being forced to miss the Perth Test owing to a hamstring injury) with a hundred  103. He spoke to the media in general and, later, briefly to The Telegraph separately.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On Adam Gilchrist deciding to quit         
	Its massive news and its surprising news... From my point of view, I feel incredibly privileged to have played with Adam for as long as I have... Hes been a remarkable Australian and has held the Baggy Green in his hands with great pride and passion... Great discipline, great work ethic... A fantastic leader and a cricketer with the ability to change a game... Hes been one of the greatest to have played cricket and theres a side of Adam which makes him so special  he builds relationships and enjoys, to the fullest, those relationships. Hell be deeply, deeply missed... Greatness is what we aspire for in the Australian team and he fulfilled everything that was asked of him by his captains...         
	On when did the team get to know of Gilchrists decision         
	Adam informed everyone individually in the morning... There was a lot of emotion... What he wants out of this is to be able to celebrate this Test... To be able to do exactly what we want and thats to grind out a first innings total... Adam will talk about his own emotions at the end of this Test.         
	On whether Gilchrist indicated why he was quitting         
	No... There was surprise last summer too when Justin (Langer), Damien (Martyn), Glenn (McGrath) and (Shane Warne) Warney decided to retire... We can only look at what Adams done throughout his career and all of those things have been incredibly positive... The way that weve enjoyed his success, the way he has inspired people... His flamboyant nature equals that of the greats... (Sir) Vivian Richards and some of the other calypso characters... Adams had stellar performances over such a long period... Longevity is the ultimate pat on the back when it comes to a professional sportsman. Hes played with remarkable skill and entertained not just himself but everyone globally... And hes done so in a statesman-like way. He changed cricketers throughout the world by the very nature of the way he played.         
	On Gilchrist getting the stick from the Australian media each time he missed a dismissal         
	(Grins) We get used to the melodramatic nature of what we do... The highs and lows... They come and go... Longevity is what speaks volumes in terms of the professional attitude and the discipline that an individual carries throughout a long career... Adams been remarkable... Hes worn off the critics... Hes actually relished the critics, as all of us have, becoming better cricketers and better persons. Theres no free lunch in Test cricket or any other top form of the game and its difficult to play for a long time without going through bumps along the way... We look at each other in a positive manner and it helps that Australia has had such a successful era.         
	On, like Gilchrist, being 36         
	Yes... Im enjoying my cricket and, like Adam, Ill know when its my time to retire... Its not now.         
	On getting to 30 Test hundreds, one more than Sir Donald Bradman         
	Ive never looked at my career in terms of stats and numbers, but Ive looked at what Ive done for the team... Today (Saturday) was one of those days when we needed to have a really good platform to establish any chance of being in the hunt... When I look back at my career, I relish the partnerships Ive enjoyed and today was another one (with Phil Jaques)... Phil has been a wonderful replacement for Justin... My game plan was to be at the wicket for as long as possible... For me, occupation of the crease is as simple as watching the ball... Theres no mystery, but as soon as you take your eyes off the ball, it becomes a very difficult game. So, I try and keep it simple.         
	On having got a hundred in each of the three Tests hes played in the series         
	Todays hundred was important in that I had to help put a platform in place... It wasnt, by any means, a match-winning performance... At this stage, Sachin has that honour (for his 153)... As the conditions will deteriorate, todays innings was a beauty... The wicket is hard and abrasive... Absolutely baked...         
	On whether hes chasing topper Sachin Tendulkar, who has 39 hundreds         
	Hes quite far ahead... I dont look at specific numbers... Obviously, Im happy to have reached 30, but will take the hundreds one at a time.         
	On whether Australia Day inspired him         
	(Laughs) Absolutely... My first hundred (125 against the West Indies, in 1997) had also been on Australia Day... Usually, the ODI series is played at this time of the year, which is a shame because its great to be playing Test cricket at the Adelaide Oval on Australia Day.         
	On whether it was Australias game plan to be extra watchful on Day III         
	No, it was purely a response to the way India decided to bowl... Unless I was to take four stumps outside the off and bat out there, I dont think I had much chance of reaching most of the deliveries... The Indians resorted to bowling very wide and we didnt feel particularly threatened... They delayed the second new ball as all they wanted was to stop us from scoring.         
	On Virender Sehwags contention that the Australians were scared of losing         
	My comment is that the way the Indians bowled was perfect for us not to lose the game! Were 2-1 up in the series and definitely want that to stay.         
	Finally, whether he had his favourite daal-rice on the night before his hundred         
	(Grins) Not this time.

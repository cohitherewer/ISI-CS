The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No trading in 2009: Bindra
                                                                                                                                                                                                       No trading in 2009: Bindra
  - Owner(s) and icon need to get used to living with each other, says IPL governing council member       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Inderjit Singh Bindra                                 
	Calcutta: Describing the Indian Premier League (IPL) as bigger than the World Cup, governing council member Inderjit Singh Bindra has clarified that while barter would be allowed before the second edition, next year, there would be no trading till 2010.         
	Players can be exchanged between the eight franchises, but there wont be any monetary transaction in 2009 That, at least, is the position till today Its one way of encouraging city-specific loyalties, Bindra told The Telegraph on Monday morning, some 12 hours after the IPLs inaugural edition ended with a dream-like final.         
	Bindra, by the way, is a former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and is the International Cricket Councils principal adviser-designate.         
	Barter could be in the form of one team exchanging say a wicketkeeper for a specialist batsman or bowler The actual trading, though, will only be in the third year, Bindra added.         
	Bindra, however, was quick to point out that the situation could change if it became absolutely necessary.                     
	Asked if any of the five icons (Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh) were free to part ways with their owners before 2010, Bindra replied: No That three-year lock-in period cant be altered If theres a problem, then the owner(s) and the icon need to get used to living with each other The sooner, the better         
	Of late, theres been speculation that the Bangalore Royal Challengers captain, Dravid, and owner Vijay Mallya could bring their association to an end.         
	Meanwhile, Bindras personal opinion is that the cap on fielding no more than four overseas players in the XI should remain.         
	After all, wed like more Indian youngsters to get opportunities That so many of them did so well this year makes the case stronger, Bindra signed off.         
	The IPL rules stipulate that no franchise can have more than eight players from overseas on its rolls.

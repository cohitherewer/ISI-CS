	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Stanley Rozario, like the clubs innumerable supporters, was a happy man on Thursday evening after his boys managed to return to winning ways beating their much weaker opponents New Delhi Heroes 2-0 in the group C match of the 30th Federation Cup.         
	Sunil Chetri and substitute Alvito DCunha scored in the 46th and 83rd minute respectively as the defending champions bagged three crucial points from their opening tie of the encounter.         
	Initially East Bengal were kept well under control by the Delhi outfit, thanks to some brilliant saves by custodian Rajat Guha.         
	Yusif Yakubu made his way through the Heroes defence before unleashing a square pass for Sunil.         
	The latter raced past a couple of defenders, who dropped their guard suspecting him of being off side, and with a clinical left-footer found the far corner. It was a minute into the second half.

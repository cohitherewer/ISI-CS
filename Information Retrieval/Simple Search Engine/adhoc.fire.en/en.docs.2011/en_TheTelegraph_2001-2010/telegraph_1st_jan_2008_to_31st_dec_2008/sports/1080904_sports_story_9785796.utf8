The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dias threatens AIFF
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dias threatens AIFF
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Steven Dias                           
	New Delhi: Ace midfielder Steven Dias said on Wednesday that he would not play football this season if he was forced by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to continue with Mahindra United.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from Goa, Dias said: Worst comes to worst, I will not play football for a year and sit at home.         
	I will not don the India colours also, Dias said. Nobody can force me to play for Mahindra or East Bengal. I am going to meet the Mahindra president in Mumbai on Saturday. If they dont increase my salary considerably this season, I am not going to play for them.         
	Dias said he had nothing against any individual. People in the football circle felt I had some problems with the coach (Derrick Pereira). Thats rubbish. My relationship with the coach is absolutely fine, Dias added.         
	Mahindra coach Derrick Pereira said he was looking forward to getting both Dias and NP Pradeep back in the team.         
	The former India player, who has been coaching Mahindra for three seasons now, said: I am happy to know that the confusion has finally been cleared. Both Pradeep and Dias will be our players after September 5.         
	Pereira said he has nothing against the two players for trying to switch over to East Bengal, a move which was shot down by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) after Mahindra lodged a protest.         
	I was surprised when some people suggested that they were leaving because of me, Pereira said.

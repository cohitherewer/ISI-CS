	Durban: Gary Kirstens first official assignment as Team India coach happened to be against the team he was once part of and the former South Africa opener admitted that there were moments before the drawn Test series when he was uncertain about his loyalties.         
	Whatever I may have said previously, Id be lying if I said I never had any doubts about my loyalties if the result of the series was delicately balanced, Kirsten was quoted as saying by a local newspaper here.         
	India rallied to draw the series 1-1 after winning the third and final Test in Kanpur in three days on a turning track.         
	And Kirsten said despite the pre-series dilemmas, he had become very clear as to which team he wanted to support by the time India wrapped up the series.         
	Im happy to be able to say I wanted India to win the last Test, he said.         
	Former opener Kirsten was a part of the South African team till 2004 before retiring from international cricket. (PTI)

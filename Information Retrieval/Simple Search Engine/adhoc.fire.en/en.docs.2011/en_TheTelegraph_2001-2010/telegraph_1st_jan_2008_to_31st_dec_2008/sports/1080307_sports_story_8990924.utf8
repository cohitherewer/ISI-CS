The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Torres hattrick in Liverpool win
                                                   Torres hattrick in Liverpool win
                      
	London: Fernando Torres scored his second Anfield hattrick in less than two weeks as Liverpool thrashed West Ham United 4-0 to go fourth in the Premier League on Wednesday.         
	The Spanish striker got all three in the 3-2 win over Middlesbrough on February 23.         
	Liverpool faced a test of will against a West Ham side who beat them 1-0 at Upton Park in January.         
	However, they were rewarded with the opening goal by Torres after eight minutes when he turned in a low cross from Dirk Kuyt. The same duo combined for the second after 61 minutes, this time Torres heading home the Dutchmans cross. Torres completed the treble in the 81st minute.         
	Gerrard rounded off a great night for Liverpool two minutes later. (Reuters)

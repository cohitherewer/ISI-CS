The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Greece out to show win was no fluke
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Greece out to show win was no fluke
                      
	Salzburg: Greece will be eager to prove their surprise 2004 triumph was no fluke when they launch their European Championship title defence against Sweden on Tuesday.         
	The Greeks, who sailed through qualification, are targeting at least a place in the last eight with tricky group D games against Russia and Spain to follow.         
	Coach Otto Rehhagel may decide to drop his tried and tested 4-4-2 system in favour of a three-pronged attack featuring Angelos Haristeas, Fanis Gekas and Yannis Amanatidis.         
	Greece hit 25 goals in 12 qualifiers, more than double the total they scored ahead of the 2004 tournament.         
	I want to score but what is important is to win this game, to win our first match, Haristeas told reporters. Both teams are similar. They are physical, quick and rely heavily on tactics.         
	Every player in the squad is fit to play including midfielder Giorgios Karagounis, who is over with the knee injury that has been nagging him for two weeks, defender Paraskevas Antzas and goalkeeper Antonis Nikopolidis.         
	Henrik Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are expected to start up front for Sweden although the latter is unlikely to last the 90 minutes due to a swollen knee.         
	Sweden coach Lars Lagerback sees a lot of similarities between the teams.         
	Greece are a very good side, he said. They are a lot like us in the way they play. They do the basics very well and are well-disciplined.

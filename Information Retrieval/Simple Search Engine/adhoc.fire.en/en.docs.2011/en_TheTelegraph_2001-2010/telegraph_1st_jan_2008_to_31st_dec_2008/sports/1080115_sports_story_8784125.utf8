                                                   Ponting pledges to correct mistakes

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Ricky Ponting, taken aback by the vehemence of protests from all corners regarding Australias on-field conduct in Sydney, has said his team will try to identify and address the areas where they went wrong during the controversial second Test. 
    
	In his column published on Monday in The Australian, Ponting said he had conducted a meeting among his teammates and other officials where the spirit of cricket was discussed at length and a pledge taken of adhering to it. 
    
	I have been surprised by the reaction of some in the broader community who believe we did not play that amazing Sydney Test in the spirit of the game. 
    
	We take the spirit of cricket very seriously and are determined to ensure we are not only remembered as a good team but one that is respected throughout the cricket world for the way we play. 
    
	That is why I led a meeting this afternoon of our team and other cricket officials, where we revisited our spirit of cricket pledge. We looked back at last weeks game and discussed little areas where we believed we could improve things, the Australian captain wrote. 
    
	He admitted that there were a couple of areas where they could have acted differently. 
    
	I know when I was given out in the first innings in Sydney that I should have left straightaway instead of hanging around for a few seconds, and I know I should not have lobbed my bat into the dressing room. 
    
	Clarke also knows that he should have gone straightaway too. He knows he did the wrong thing but at the time he was just shocked at how he had got out first ball. 
    
	No-one is beyond criticism or bigger than the game. 
    
	The sharp reaction from the media, Ponting said, had disturbed him initially but he felt better when Cricket Australia threw its full weight behind the players.

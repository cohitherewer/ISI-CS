                                                                                                                                                                                                       Stanley: Need a good start
            A STAFF REPORTER            Stanley Rozario                           
	Calcutta: East Bengals newly recruited coach Stanley Rozario said his biggest challenge was to instil belief in his very talented players and make them forget the past and focus on the upcoming I-League.         
	The red-and-gold brigade finished a disappointing third in the recently concluded Calcutta Football League (CFL) behind archrivals Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting.         
	Rozario said he has made a few adjustments to the side, as immediate changes were not possible in the short time he had at his disposal.         
	Its not been a week since I have taken charge. I have not seen them play. The boys are very talented. I want them to believe in themselves Rozario said.         
	Rozario, the assistant to national coach Bob Houghton, also said he was happy with the five-day conditioning camp, which ended on Saturday, before the start of the I-League.         
	I have tried to make them forget what has happened in the past and focus more on the I-League, he told The Telegraph.         
	We need a good start If we get a good start it will make the boys forget the past. The winning attitude is very important.         
	The coach declined to comment on the third and final foreigner in his side, but according to sources he has asked for the resume of Calcutta Port Trusts Nigerian defender Ayeni Bidemi Daniel.         
	Incidentally Edmilson Marquez, Suley Musah and Yakubu (yet to finish his signing) are the three foreigners already training with the side.         
	East Bengal are scheduled to practise at the Barasat stadium on Monday, where they play city rivals United SC in their I-League opener on Friday.         
	Mohammedan Sporting holding their conditioning camp at Khardah, are meanwhile hoping that their mainstay in attack Theodore Sunday gets fit before the start of the league.         
	Sunday, CFLs topscorer has been advised physiotherapy and is not part of the squads conditioning camp.         
	Coach Shabbir Ali said his first aim was to save relegation in the I-League and is stressing on consistency.         
	We will try our best with the limited resources There are no national players in my side. So, my first aim is to save relegation and try and aim higher from there, the coach of the CFL runners-up said.         
	I am hoping high. But the players have to deliver.         
	The black-and-white brigade begin their I-League campaign against Air India on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Close win for Jyoti
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Close win for Jyoti
                  Randhawa                     
	Greater Noida: Jyoti Randhawa blasted a sensational eight-under 64 in the final round to clinch the Rs 80 lakh BILT Open title here on Sunday.         
	The Delhi golfer made a dramatic comeback on the edge-of-the-seat final day to break clear off the pack and total 19-under 269 to pip Jeev Milkha Singh (67) and overnight leader Anirban Lahiri (71) by one stroke.         
	Riding on good approach shots and accurate putting, Randhawa clocked a flurry of birdies, starting with a hattrick from the second to fourth holes before picking up more shots on the seventh and eighth to take the turn at five-under.         
	While the front nine was a smooth sail, his back nine was not too bad either. He was off the block with birdies on the 10th and 12th before he stumbled on the 13th, dropping a bogey there.         
	However, Randhawa fired an eagle on the 15th to total 19-under and maintained the lead as he parred the rest.         
	It was the 20-footer 15th hole eagle which was the turning point of the day, Randhawa said later.         
	Randhawa had some anxious moment at the last hole when his tee shot landed on the edge of the hedges but the experienced campaigner chipped it away and then took an accurate approach shot before sinking a 12-footer to par the last hole.         
	I am very happy. It was a great win. Since yesterday things started coming together for me. It was since last two days that I gave myself a chance and decided to go for it, Randhawa added.         
	I putted like a demon and the holes looked like buckets to me today, he said while explaining his days performance.         
	I feel Indian conditions suit me and I am happy to win here but to tell the truth the feeling has not yet registered in my mind, said Randhawa, who won his fifth PGTI event with this tournament.         
	Jeev also had a good day in the greens despite missing some close birdie chances just by inches. The Asian number one played some immaculate drives and bunker play to close in the gap with Lahiri.         
	Playing his front nine first, Jeev reeled off a birdie hattrick from third to fifth holes before dropping a bogey on the sixth to take the turn at two-under.         
	On resumption, he gained a shot each on the 10th, 15th and 16th holes to turn 18-under and had it not been for his seven-foot birdie putt miss in the final hole, he could well have forced a playoff.         
	I was confident of putting the seven-foot birdie in the 18th hole. I took my time but could not manage at the end, said Jeev, who participated in a PGTI event for the first time.         
	I played rock solid this week. Right from the tee to the greens, I have been playing really well all through the week. I had some number in the mind for the final round but I felt short of that. But over all I am happy with my performance, he added.           (AGENCIES)

	Beijing: Marathon runners, like fine wines, usually improve with age and Romanias new Olympic champion Constantina Tomescu proved the point on Sunday.         
	The 38-year-old became the oldest Olympic womens marathon winner by eight years and believes her age worked to her advantage. The experience of age helped me, she told reporters.I have raced a lot before, I know a lot about running.         
	Her age may also have also lulled the field into thinking she was not a serious contender and the pack let the Colorado-based runner go when she jumped ahead midway through the race and built a decisive 90-second lead.         
	I said (to myself,) what happened, why are they not coming? Tomescu said. Kenyan silver medallist Catherine Ndereba and Chinas bronze medallist Chunxiu Zhou never stood a chance of catching her and could only battle for the minor places.         
	Tomescu finished third in the 2005 world championships but she dropped out of the 2003 world championship marathon and at the 2004 Olympics she faded to finish 20th after a strong start.

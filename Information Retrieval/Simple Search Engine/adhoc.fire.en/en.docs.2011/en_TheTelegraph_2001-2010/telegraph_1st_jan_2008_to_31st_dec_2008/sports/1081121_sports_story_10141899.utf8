The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We were always in control
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We were always in control
                      
	Kanpur: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said his side were the deserving winners in the third one-dayer here on Thursday though England gave them the closest fight in the series so far.         
	It was a tough match and it was the closest so far but we were ahead at every stage, he said.         
	In the morning when I went out for the toss I knew that D-L method could be applied as we know light fades away very fast at this venue after 4pm. So we were prepared, I had a chit of D-L calculations. Once we knew D-L method would be applied we decided to preserve wickets as we knew we were ahead and runs could be scored from the power play (to be taken by batting side), he said after the match.         
	Dhoni said the pitch was a difficult one to bat on but his batsmen were up to the task by taking ones and twos and ensured that no wickets were lost once the D-L method came into picture.         
	Man of the Match Harbhajan Singh said bowling slower in the air than the earlier two matches did the trick. In the earlier two matches the grounds were smaller and I had to attack the wickets. But here I slowed down in the air and it worked. Otherwise there was no change in my bowling.           (PTI)

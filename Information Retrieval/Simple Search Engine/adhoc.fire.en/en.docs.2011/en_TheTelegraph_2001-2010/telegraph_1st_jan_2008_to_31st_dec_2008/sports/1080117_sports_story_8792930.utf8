                                                   Steve: Were still suffering from Sydney blues

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Steve Waugh feels Australia appeared a confused bunch on the field in Perth on Day I  confused whether or not to appeal  a clear indication that they are still suffering from Sydney blues. 
    
	The iconic former captain, in his column for the Courier Mail, felt he saw it during Adam Gilchrists predicament at the Waca. 
    
	It is not too often you see a look of anguish and uncertainty on Gilchrists face but I saw it on Wednesday. 
    
	It came after the first major appeal of the day, when Stuart Clark struck Wasim Jaffer on the top of his arm guard and the ball deflected down the leg side to be taken by Gilchrist. 
    
	What followed was a fascinating snapshot of Life After Sydney for the Australian players. 
    
	They were appealing with great gusto and then suddenly they werent. 
    
	In fact, they were not quite sure what to do or how to appeal, an obvious postscript to the scrutiny of the sides behaviour in the Sydney Test. 
    
	Waugh thought Gilchrist had an anguished look on his face. 
    
	Gilly had an anguished look that probably came from the fact that from behind the wicket there is no way he would have known whether the ball had hit bat or arm guard  yet he was quite entitled to ask the question. 
    
	You could see the concern on Gillys face as the episode was played out. 
    
	The former Australia captain felt Virender Sehwags strength is actually his weakness and is a hard man to plan for. 
    
	Sehwag is an interesting performer and a hard man to plan for because his strength is his weakness. 
    
	His offside shots are the pistons that keep him pumping yet at times he looks vulnerable trying to play them. 
    
	You get the impression he wants the bowlers to think he is suspect outside off stump and to challenge him there. 
    
	He played and missed a handful of times and spanked some fine boundaries before Australia got their man. 
    
	Steve felt its time India drop Wasim Jaffer.

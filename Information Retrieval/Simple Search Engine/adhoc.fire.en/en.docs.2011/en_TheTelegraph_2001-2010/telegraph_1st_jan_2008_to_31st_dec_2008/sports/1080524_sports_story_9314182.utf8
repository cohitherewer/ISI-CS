The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer faces big Querrey in opener
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Federer faces big Querrey in opener
                      
	Paris: Roger Federers bid to win a first French Open will face a testing start after he was drawn to face big American Sam Querrey in the first round.         
	But the Swiss world No. 1 has the comfort of avoiding Novak Djokovic, the best player in the world this year, until a possible final clash.         
	Instead the Serb world No. 3, who took Federers Australian Open title in January, was placed in the same half of the draw as triple champion Rafael Nadal who is bidding to become the first player since Bjorn Borg in 1981 to win four titles in a row here.         
	Nadal begins his campaign against a qualifier with a possible tricky quarter final against David Nalbandian.         
	Nadal has lost both his meetings with the Argentine.         
	Djokovic, meanwhile, begins his campaign against Germanys Denis Gremelmayr.         
	Federer will still have a tough road to a possible final.         
	Federer, bidding to complete a career Grand Slam after losing to Nadal in the last two years, will face the 20-year-old Querrey who is riding high after capturing his maiden career title in Las Vegas this year. Querrey also showed that he is no fool on clay when he reached the quarter finals at the Monte Carlo Masters in April knocking out former French Open winner Carlos Moya on the way.         
	Womens top seed Maria Sharapova, bidding to win a first French Open and complete a career Grand Slam, begins her campaign against fellow Russian Evgeniya Rodina, the world No. 104.         
	Second seed Ana Ivanovic of Serbia, the runner-up to Justine Henin in 2007, faces Swedens Sofia Andersson while 2002 champion Serena Williams of the US starts against fellow-American Ashley Harkelroad.         
	Sebastien Grosjean and Daniela Hantuchova, meanwhile, have withdrawn from the tournament on Friday because of injuries. (Agencies)

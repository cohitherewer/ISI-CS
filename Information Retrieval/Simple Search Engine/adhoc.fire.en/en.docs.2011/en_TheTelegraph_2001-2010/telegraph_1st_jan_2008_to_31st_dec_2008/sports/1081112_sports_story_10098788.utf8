	Shanghai: Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles lost to top seeds Mike and Bob Bryan at the Masters Cup on Tuesday.
                                                                                                                                                          The third seeds went down 5-7, 6-3, 4-10 (super tie-break) in the second of their round robin clashes in the Red group.
    The fiercely contested first set saw the Bryan brothers taking the lead as they converted a crucial breakpoint even as Bhupathi and Knowles missed theirs.
    The Indo-Czech pair drew parity by winning the second set by breaking their rivals twice and saving as many breakpoints on their serve.
    However, in the super tie-break the Bryan brothers prevailed to record their second successive win.
    In the other red group match, Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay and Luis Horna of Peru beat South Africans Jeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie 6-2, 6-7 (2), 11-9 (super tie-break).
  Serb world No. 3 Novak Djokovic survived a second-set implosion to beat Russian Nikolay Davydenko 7-6, 0-6, 7-5 on Tuesday and become the first player into the semi-finals.
    The 21-year-old, who lost all three of his matches on his Masters Cup debut last year but won his opener against Juan Martin del Potro on Sunday, is guaranteed to top the Gold group after prevailing in a two-hour, 18-minute encounter.
    Argentine Del Potro beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6, 7-6 in the other group match to keep alive his hopes of reaching the knockout stage and end those of the Frenchman.
  Davydenko, who beat Tsonga in his Sunday opener, will now have to beat Del Potro on Thursday to reach the Masters Cup semi-finals for a second time.
    The 27-year-old Russian was at his dogged best at the start of Tuesday rsquo;s match and broke the second-seeded Australian Open champion on his first service game.
  Djokovic held his nerve, however, broke back when the world No. 5 was serving for the set and raced to a 4-0 lead in the tie-break that followed.
    A couple of aces gave him set point, which the Russian fourth seed conceded with a double fault.
    The young Serb fell apart in the second set, smashing his racket about and clearly seething when a line call and subsequent challenge went against him.
    Davydenko, a seasoned campaigner playing in his fourth Masters Cup, seized his chance to even up the match and grabbed two break points in Djokovic rsquo;s first service game of the deciding set.
    Djokovic, though, regained his composure and battled back to save his serve. The match looked destined for another tie-break when he broke for 6-5 and served out for victory.
    Seventh seed Del Potro broke Tsonga rsquo;s first service game and, although the Frenchman broke back, always looked the more likely to win a tight contest.
    ldquo;I know his game, rdquo; said the 20-year-old Del Potro. ldquo;I know what can I do against this player, and that rsquo;s what I did today. I played very good. rdquo;
    Sixth seed Tsonga served up 17 aces and rattled home 42 winners but that good work was undone by 38 unforced errors, the last of which came when he put the ball in the net to end the second tie-break.
    ldquo;I know he played better than me in the tie-break, rdquo; Tsonga said. ldquo;I miss some easy balls, and that rsquo;s it. rdquo;
    The 20-year-old Del Potro, plagued by a sore toe since the US Open, is the youngest player in the field. 
    He said he was trying to win while also trying to save some energy for Argentina rsquo;s Davis Cup final against Spain on Nov. 21-23.
    ldquo;For all tennis players, it rsquo;s like a dream to be here, rdquo; Del Potro said. ldquo;But also next week it will be another dream. rdquo;
    Roger Federer and Andy Roddick, who lost their first matches in the Red group, play each other on Wednesday, while Andy Murray and Gilles Simon also play.    (AGENCIES)

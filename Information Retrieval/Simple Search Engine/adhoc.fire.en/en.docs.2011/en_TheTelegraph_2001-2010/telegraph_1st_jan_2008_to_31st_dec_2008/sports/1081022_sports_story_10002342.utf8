The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo go down 1-4 to Safa 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dempo go down 1-4 to Safa 
                      
	Hyderabad: Poor defending dashed Dempos hopes of becoming the first Indian club to reach the final of the AFC Cup after they were demolished 1-4 by Lebanons Safa FC in the return leg semi-final tie to go down 1-5 on aggregate, here on Tuesday.         
	Needing to win by at least a 2-0 margin to break the monopoly of West Asian countries in this tournament after the Goa club lost 0-1 in the first leg in Beirut, Armando Colacos boys were staring down the barrel as early as the ninth minute when Mohammad Kassas headed home from a free-kick.         
	Even before they could regroup, Dempo conceded the second goal when Kassas knocked in his second from close in the 19th minute. And, down by two goals in the first half, it was an uphill task for Dempo.         
	Conceding an early goal was a real setback for us, admitted Dempos stand-in coach Mauricio Afonso at the post-match press conference.         
	Dempo tried hard to get things back on track and Mboyo Iyomi managed to reduce the deficit when he stabbed home in the 60th minute.         
	With the score reading 2-1 (3-1 overall), Dempo needed three more goals in the next half hour to progress to the title round but were undone by two quick goals towards the end of the match.         
	Hussein Tahan, who replaced Rony Azar, scored a brace to take the Lebanese side to the final in their debut AFC Cup campaign.         
	Afonso claimed they were undone by some poor defending. I accept defeat. I am not blaming anybody but I am not happy with the defending, said the clubs assistant coach, who was standing in for Armando Colaco, who was down with fever.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Royals, Punjab in clash of titans
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Royals, Punjab in clash of titans
                      
	Mohali: Having already ensured semi-final berths, Indian Premier Leagues top teams in the table  Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab  would face each other to gain psychological advantage in their last league match at PCA stadium on Wednesday.         
	Although the outcome of the match is inconsequential, the teams would be locked in a keen tussle, as they would like to go with their morale up in the semi-finals.         
	Besides, the Kings XI Punjab, who had lost to Shane Warnes young team in their previous meeting, would be rather eager to settle scores.         
	But the Rajasthan Royals are in terrific form, leading the points table having won 11 of their 13 matches, and their latest last-ball win against Mumbai Indians should act as a further moral booster for them.         
	The Punjab team, too, have been in good form, winning nine of their 13 matches and came back strongly after losing their first two games.         
	However, the defeat at the hands of Kolkata Knight Riders who registered an incredible win after it looked improbable at one stage in the previous match should give Punjab reason to work over weak areas.         
	Skipper Yuvraj has already pointed out that there is scope of further improvement in the fielding department.         
	On the other hand, the Warne-led team showed on Monday in a match against Mumbai Indians at Jaipur that they would like to maintain winning momentum. The team have not been dependent on any one or two individual performances and all have contributed at one stage or the other.

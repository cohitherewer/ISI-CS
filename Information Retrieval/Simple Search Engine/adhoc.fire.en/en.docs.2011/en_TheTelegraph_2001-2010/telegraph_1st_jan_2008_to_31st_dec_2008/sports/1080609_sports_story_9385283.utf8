                                                                                                                                                                                                     Empty stands, more police
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Srinagar: Going to the Bakshi Stadium on Sunday was a completely different experience.         
	On Saturday, thousands of spectators clashed with policemen to turn the Bakshi Stadium into a battlefield. Twenty-four hours later, the same venue looked a deserted place as there were less than hundred people in the general stands to watch two of Indias strongest teams  Bengal and Goa  in action in the Santosh Trophy.         
	In the morning, hosts Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab played out the remaining 22 minutes of the match that could not be completed on Saturday. The stands were deserted as Punjab held on to their 1-0 lead to put Jammu and Kashmir out of the tournament.         
	In the evening, there were more security men than spectators. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), who took over the charge, were extremely cautious in their approach. Even the media persons were asked to sign the register, kept at the VIP gate, before entering the field.         
	Though none in the organising committee was ready to come on record, they were upset with the way the policemen handled the situation during the crowd violence on Saturday.         
	There was trouble in the stands from the very beginning of the match between Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab, said a senior member of the local association. We pointed it out to the security people but they never bothered to put a proper check on it. In the end, when things went out of control, they went for a lathi charge. It helped no one, he said.         
	The organisers are worried that attendance in the stands may drop heavily in the next few days in the final stages of the tournament. Saturdays incident has hampered the goodwill of the tournament badly, an official said. All our good work has gone to waste.               
	Mondays matches: Services vs Jammu amp; Kashmir (2.15 pm); Kerala vs Punjab (4.15 pm).

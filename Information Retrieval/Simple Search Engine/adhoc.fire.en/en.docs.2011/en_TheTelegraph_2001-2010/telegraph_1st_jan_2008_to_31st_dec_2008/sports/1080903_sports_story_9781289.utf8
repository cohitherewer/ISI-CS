                                                                                                                                                                                           Sumo wrestlers test positive
                      
	Tokyo: Two Russian sumo wrestlers have tested positive for marijuana, two weeks after another Russian was banned for life after being arrested on suspicion of possessing the drug.         
	Roho and Hakurozan, who are brothers, tested positive after urine tests carried out on a total of 69 wrestlers. Shohei Onishi, an official on the Japan Sumo Associations (JSA) anti-doping panel, announced the results here on Tuesday.         
	The tests were carried out after Russian wrestler Wakanoho was banned for life by the association and arrested by police for marijuana possession. Wakanohos dismissal, the first expulsion of an active wrestler, was announced after an emergency meeting of the JSA executive board.         
	The association did not immediately announce whether Roho and Hakurozan would be punished. The two were also being questioned by Tokyo Police, according to a police official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case was under investigation.

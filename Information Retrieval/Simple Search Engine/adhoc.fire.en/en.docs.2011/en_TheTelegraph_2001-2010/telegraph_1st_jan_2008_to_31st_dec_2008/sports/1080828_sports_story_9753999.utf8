	Colombo: A spirited India on Wednesday recorded their first-ever bilateral ODI series triumph in Sri Lanka, beating the hosts by 46 runs in the fourth one-day International to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series.         
	Chasing a target of 259, the hosts were dismissed for 212 in 46.3 overs.         
	Indian bowlers were impressive once again with Munaf Patel (2/48) dealing two early blows.         
	Malinda Warnapura (0) went without bothering the scorers.         
	He was adjudged leg-before but TV replays suggested the ball could have gone over the stumps.         
	Kumar Sangakkara (6), demoted to No.3 following his woeful run in the tournament, failed once more as he played on a Munaf delivery.                   
	However, Indias nemesis Sanath Jayasuriya (60 of 52 balls) was at his explosive best and with skipper Mahela Jayawardene (16), put up a 74-run stand for the fourth wicket to steady the Lankan innings.         
	It took an inspiring bowling change from Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the 17th over to stop the Matara Marauder.         
	Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh (3/40), who replaced Praveen Kumar, picked up the crucial wicket after Jayasuriya edged a turner and Suresh Raina made no mistake in the first slip.         
	Sri Lanka was dealt another blow when Jayawardene was caught short off his crease by Kohli following a terrible mix up with Chamara Kapugedera (30), leaving the hosts at 106 for four in 24.3 overs.         
	Next to go was Tillekeratne Dilshan (12), who was wrapped on the pads by Harbhajan in his seventh over which brought an end to his 25-run stand with Kapugedera.         
	Four overs later, Kapugedera followed suit after he was caught in front by Yuvraj Singh (2/53).         
	The Indian vice-captain made up for his batting failure as Vaas became his second victim.         
	Earlier, Dhoni (71), Suresh Raina (76) and Virat Kohli (54) struck half centuries to post a competitive 258 despite a late collapse.         
	For the hosts, Thushara took five wickets for 47 as India lost their last seven wickets for just 34 runs.         
	Raina and Dhoni were at their aggressive best as India raced to the 150 mark in 185 balls.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                                                                                                     CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Yousuf, Gul in line for ICL  
	Karachi: Having missed the IPL bus, Pakistan run-machine Mohammed Yousuf may eventually return to the rebel fold, according to sources. Yousuf is reportedly unhappy at missing IPL despite assurances by the PCB, which had earlier prompted him to back out of the deal he had with the rebel ICL.  
	According to sources, Yousuf and some leading Pakistan players who are uncertain about their future with the Pakistan team and unhappy with the prevailing cricket condition in the country had shown interest in joining ICL next season. The source claimed pacer Umar Gul and Yasir Hameed could also be among the next batch of players from Pakistan, besides Yousuf, to join the ICL.    
	PCB unhappy  
	Karachi: The PCB is unhappy with the appointments of Mike Procter and Steve Bucknor as officials in the one-day series against Bangaldesh starting Tuesday. PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said the board will talk to the ICC on this matter. I will have our director (cricket operations) speak to his counterpart in the ICC on this issue, Ashraf said. Bangladesh arrived in Pakistan on Sunday for five ODIs, beginning April 8, and a Twenty20 match. Shoaib Akhtar has not played for Pakistan in the last two three series, but still they are a good bowling side and we have to play at our best to beat them, Bangladesh captain Mohammed Ashraful said.    
	ODI rankings  
	Calcutta: Pakistan will aim to narrow the gap with fourth-placed India in the ICC ODI Championship table when they take on Bangladesh in the five-match series starting in Lahore from Tuesday, stated an ICC release. Pakistan are currently lying fifth on 109 rating points, four behind India and two ahead of Sri Lanka. If Shoaib Maliks side sweeps the series 5-0, it will earn one rating points which will put it on 110 ratings points - three behind India and three ahead of Sri Lanka.    
	Asif comeback  
	Karachi: Fast bowler Mohammed Asif makes a comeback to competitive cricket on Monday after a six-month lay-off due to a elbow injury that required surgery in Australia. Asif will appear for his domestic team National Bank in the national one-day championship semi-finals here. I have been bowling in the nets and my elbow is much better now. But obviously the real Test will come when I play the match and bowl 10 overs, Asif said.    
	IPL tickets  
	Calcutta: The online booking of Indian Premier League (IPL) tickets for Kolkata Knight Riderss matches at the Eden got underway on Sunday. About 239 members  197 life, 27 annual and 15 associated members booked their tickets on Sunday.

	The ticket sales for the general public are likely to start from April 16.

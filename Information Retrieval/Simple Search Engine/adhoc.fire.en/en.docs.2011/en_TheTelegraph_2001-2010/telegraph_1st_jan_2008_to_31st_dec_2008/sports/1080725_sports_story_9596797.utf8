	London: World motorsport chief Max Mosley welcomed his victory in his legal action against a British daily on Thursday which alleged he took part in a Nazi-style orgy, saying it nailed the Nazi lie.         
	In a statement issued shortly after a high court judge ruled in his favour in a privacy suit against the News of the World tabloid, he said he hoped the verdict would stop such invasive and salacious journalism in future.

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	New Delhi: Twenty four hours before leaving for Calcutta, Dempos interim coach Mauricio Afonso said that Sundays match against East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium could be decisive vis--vis the Goa teams push to scale the I-League summit. 
    
	East Bengal may be struggling to avoid relegation but our match against them will be extremely crucial for the title race We have a tough battle ahead, Afonso said from Goa. 
    
	The I-League is interestingly poised. With six rounds remaining, Dempo have a two-point advantage over JCT and are four points ahead of Churchill Brothers. 
    
	Afonso said if Dempo manage to come unscathed from their Calcutta assignments  they will face Mohun Bagan on February 10  it will be difficult for JCT and Churchill Brothers to catch up. 
    
	Our matches in Calcutta hold the key. Salt Lake is never an easy place to play, but weve shown in the past that we are not overawed by the conditions. The former India captain also made it clear that he would practise what Armando Colaco preached during training rather than try out anything different. 
    
	Coaching philosophy remains the same, said Afonso, who took charge of the team two days ago after Armando Colaco had an accident. Colaco has been advised rest for two months. 
    
	Dempo have left out injured Valerian Rebello and Peter Carvalho for the East Bengal match, but Beto has fully recovered from viral fever and Climax Lawrence has overcome a niggling ankle injury

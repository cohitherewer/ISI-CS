                                                     Liverpool late show breaks down 10-man Inter Milan

(Reuters)                                       
	Embarrassed by Barnsley, castigated in all quarters and kept at bay for so long by the vaunted champions of Italy, Liverpool dug deep to conjure up a magnificent display here, scoring twice late on through Dirk Kuyt and Steve Gerrard.         
	And to think that Fabio Capello harbours doubts about Gerrard. In front of the England coach, Liverpools captain drove his team forward again and again, showing the determination to stay in the Champions League.         
	Even before Materazzis excessive hounding of Torres brought deserved expulsion, everyone at Anfield had known this was a night for strong men withstanding everything Inter threw up at them. Fabio Capello, the England coach formerly of AC Milan, endured a stream of derogatory comments from visiting tifosi as he entered Anfield, even chants of youve sold your soul.         
	Soon it was the turn of Inters players to display their spikier side, testing Liverpools resolve with a series of late challenges. Torres, the spearhead of Liverpools 4-2-3-1 approach, was the main target of the clattering classes from San Siro. Dejan Stankovic was first to pole axe Liverpools pacey striker.         
	Then came that tall assassin called Materazzi, a noted defensive bulwark but too prone to the dark arts to elicit any admiration. Ask Zinedine Zidane, wound up to breaking point in the World Cup final. Ask Torres, twice caught early on by the former Evertonian. Inter seemed determined to leave Torres as black-and-blue as their famous shirts.         
	The Spaniard picked himself up each time, nodded when the Belgian referee, Frank de Bleeckere, cautioned Materazzi for one early catching of his heels and got on with his attacking work. For all their recent prominence, Inter certainly appeared rattled in the early stages and Materazzis fuse was clearly burning.         
	Stirred up by the support rolling down from the Kop, driven by a desire to read some positive headlines, Liverpool tore into Mancinis men. Benitezs tactics relied on Javier Mascherano and Lucas patrolling deep midfield. Mascherano, again outstanding, swiftly confirmed his class with some crucial interceptions, notably an immaculate dispossession of Zlatan Ibrahimovic after 20 minutes. Another tackle, on fellow Argentinian Javier Zanetti, had Liverpool fans on their feet, saluting a master at work.         
	Apart from one eye-catching break from Mascherano, Liverpools forward momentum flowed through Gerrard, driving through the middle, and particularly Ryan Babel, a vibrant force down the left. If not quite John Barnes of 1987-88 vintage, Babel certainly carried a quick threat, testing the considerable full-back talents of Maicon to the limit.         
	The first half was dominated by Babel, Mascherano and company. During a hugely promising opening, Liverpool screamed for a penalty when Ivan Cordoba appeared to handle. Jamie Carragher almost went hoarse in beseeching De Bleeckhere. Then Gerrard curled over a corner which Sami Hyypia, having escaped Materazzi, headed goalwards. Julio Cesar palmed the danger over, almost apologetically.         
	Still, Italian cynicism continued to stain the game. Stankovics studs attempted some tattoo work on Gerrards ankle. Then Materazzi, having lost Torres, stretched out his left hand to tug back the Spaniard. Torres carried on for a stride or two and then fell. Down, too, went Materazzis hopes of influencing the game any further.         
	Benitez, enraged, leapt to his feet, waggling two fingers. De Bleeckhere did not need the Spaniards grasp of maths. Out came a second yellow, eventually the red, and Materazzi departed slowly from the field, his every step followed by a chorus of abuse.         
	Advantage Liverpool. With Inters most commanding defender gone, the situation cried out for Peter Crouch. John Aldridge, who knows a thing or two about posing an attacking threat at Anfield, kept shouting into his Radio City microphone that Benitez must introduce Crouch.         
	Such sentiments were widespread. As the Kop chanted attack, attack, attack, Inter seemed there for the taking. Gerrard charged forward, and squared a ball into the six-yard box. Sadly, neither Torres not particularly Kuyt read their captains intentions.         
	With Anfield craving an extra dimension, the first change actually came from Mancini, who hooked Julio Cruz, threw on Patrick Vieira and tried to batten the hatches in 4-4-1 formation. Still Liverpool hammered against the Italian back-door. Still Inter held firm.         
	A ricochet off Kuyt sent the ball fortuitously through for Torres. He raced clear, outstripping Inters defence, and then that right boot came down, powering into the ball, sending it angling across Julio Cesar. The keeper superbly stretched out a hand and brilliantly deflected the ball to safety.         
	Still Liverpool pushed hard. Kuyt crossed and Hyypia headed over. The Kop sighed in frustration. Moments later, on the hour-mark, Liverpool supporters were seething with rage. Gerrard turned Vieira in the Inter area, cleverly lifting the ball over the former Arsenal enforcer. Vieira flung up both hands and clearly stopped the ball from progressing.         
	Liverpool awaited the inevitable award of a penalty but to mass bemusement, De Bleeckhere signalled only a corner. As incensed as the fans, Benitez decided to ring the changes. First came Crouch. Then Jermaine Pennant. Serie As finest continued to defend with impressive resilience. But the dam had to break. When the excellent Steve Finnan combined with Pennant on the right, the cross from the English winger carried through to Kuyt. The Dutchman, hitherto so ordinary, responded magnificently, driving the ball down and past Julio Cesar.         
	And there was more, gloriously so. As the clock ticked towards full-time, Gerrard collected a pass from Pennant 20 yards out, nudged the ball forward twice and then sent it flying into Inters net.

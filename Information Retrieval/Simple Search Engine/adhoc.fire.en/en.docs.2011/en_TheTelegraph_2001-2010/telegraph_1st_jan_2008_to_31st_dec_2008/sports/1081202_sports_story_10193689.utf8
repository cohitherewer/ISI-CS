            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Sheikh Ishmail Addo tries to get past a Churchill defender at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: East Bengals dreadful run in the -League continued as Churchill Brothers outsmarted them 2-1 in their round XI match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday.         
	East Bengal went into the lead in only the second minute when a casual Churchill Brothers custodian Arindam Bhattacharya missed a Chandam Singh back pass that went into the net. Arindam took his eyes off the ball while trying to receive it.         
	The Goa-team found the equaliser in the 31st minute through Man of the Match Kalu Ogba Nnanna. Churchill took the lead, which eventually turned out to be the winner, in the 60th minute through a Mehrajuddin Wadoo own goal.         
	The win helped Churchill close in on second-placed Mohun Bagan, who reached 21 points after the end of their first leg. The Goa team are now placed third with 20 points, while East Bengal are placed seventh with 12 points.         
	Churchill started playing aggressively after conceding the goal while Stanley Rozarios boys surprisingly went into a defensive shell.         
	Churchills equaliser came when Kalu Ogba took advantage of an out-of-position Subrata Paul under the East Bengal bar to send his header home.         
	After the change of ends, the hosts started on a positive note, but they were denied by a brilliant Arindam under the Churchill bars.         
	Yusif Yakubu and Sunil Chhetri combined to make some good moves but East Bengals new recruit Sheikh Ishmail Addo will need more time to settle down.         
	In the 52nd minute, Addo almost scored but a sparkling Arindam stretched himself full-length to his left to make a save.         
	Gourmangi Singhs shot hit Mehrajuddin before rolling into the net.         
	Arindam made another unbelievable save in the 78th minute when he palmed out Yakubus side volley.

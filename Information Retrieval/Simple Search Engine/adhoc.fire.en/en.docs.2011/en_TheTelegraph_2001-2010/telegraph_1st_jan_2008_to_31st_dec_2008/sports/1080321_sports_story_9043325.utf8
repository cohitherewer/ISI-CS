                                                     Award for young Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly                           
	Calcutta: The debate over the youth-versus-experience may still continue but an award on Thursday  one of many that Sourav Ganguly has received in his illustrious career  completely bowled over the young former India captain.         
	At a time when Indias ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is basking in the success of his youth policy, an award containing the young tag has come to Sourav as a pleasant surprise.         
	The Young Leaders Forum of the Indian Chamber of Commerce on Thursday conferred the Outstanding Achiever for the Year award on the 36-year-old Sourav, in recognition of his aggressive leadership and undying zeal to excel.         
	Sourav, in his acceptance speech after receiving the award, could not hide his astonishment.         
	I thank the Indian Chamber of Commerce for putting the word young before the award. I will probably wake up feeling better tomorrow, at a time when there is a debate in the country between youth and experience, he said in a lighter vein.         
	When a serious poser about Dhonis statement was thrown at him, Sourav ducked it with ease, letting it fly with a simple no comment glare.         
	He, however, did say that his mind was firmly focused on the upcoming series against South Africa.         
	It will be a very good series and Im looking forward to it. They have a good bowling attack but we have played against them earlier. So we are confident, he said.         
	Will he use the Indian Premier League platform for a return to the ODI side? All I know is that I need to keep performing in whatever format of the game Im involved in, he replied.         
	About his rigorous fitness regime of late, Sourav said: Its a long season and I have to remain fit. This fitness programme will help me stay away from injuries. Sourav has taken help of ladders and parachutes during his daily sessions either at the Eden or at a ground near his Behala residence.         
	Actor Koel Mullick also presented Sourav with a citation, which described him as legend and a cricketer unparalleled. Being recognised in any aspect of life is a huge inspiration. This is not only a recognition for my past performance but will motivate and push me to do well in the future, Sourav said.         
	Sourav joined telecom honcho Sunil Bharti Mittal, fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, industrialist Sanjiv Goenka and film-maker Karan Johar on the list of winners.

                                                   Visitors fined
                      
	South Africa have been fined for a slow over rate during their first Test victory over Bangladesh on Monday. Captain Graeme Smith was fined 30 per cent of his match fee while each of his players received 15 per cent fines, an International Cricket Council (ICC) statement said following South Africas five-wicket win.         
	ICC match referee Ranjan Madugalle imposed the fines after South Africa were ruled to be three overs short of target when time allowances were taken into consideration, the statement added.

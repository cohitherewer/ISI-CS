The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McLaren expect Ferrari fightback
                                                   McLaren expect Ferrari fightback
                      
	Melbourne: McLaren are bracing for a Ferrari fightback in Malaysia next weekend after the Formula One champions endured their worst start to a season in 16 years.         
	Its not their true pace and were under no illusions, McLaren boss Ron Dennis said after Sundays incident-packed Australian race left his teams Italian rivals with just one point to their credit.         
	Theyre a very competitive team, theyre well run. We know theyre going to be a very strong team in all the remaining races and weve got to be stronger than them, he told reporters. All we can do is try and stay focused on our own efforts and that is what we will do.         
	While McLarens 23-year-old phenomenon Lewis Hamilton chalked up a pole-to-flag victory on an afternoon of searing heat and general mayhem, neither Ferrari made it to the chequered flag in Melbourne.         
	In a race with only seven cars still running at the finish, Ferraris world champion Kimi Raikkonen picked up the single point after Hondas Brazilian Rubens Barrichello was disqualified from sixth place for a pit lane infringement.         
	Brazilian Felipe Massa, who spun into a wall on the opening lap and was later involved in a collision with Red Bulls David Coulthard while trying to pass on the inside, retired long before.         
	New Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali promised a root-and-branch inquest into what went wrong. There is not much to say about a disastrous start to the season, said the Italian in a team review of the afternoon. We did not work well on any level and this is the consequence of that.         
	We know how important is reliability and we were severely lacking on this front. It is absolutely ages since we have seen two engine failures in a race. We have to look at every detail of this weekend to understand what went wrong and how we can improve, he added.         
	Malaysia is next on Sunday, allowing little time for recovery, and McLaren will be confident of further success after a one-two finish in the race last year with now departed Spaniard Fernando Alonso leading Hamilton across the line.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff ought to have opened

                    GUEST COLUMN    Geoffrey Boycott                                              Kevin Pietersen rsquo;s inexperience showed		    
	People keep asking me whether England have lost the plot in India. I reply that they never found it. Sunday nights match was a typical example of muddled thinking: how can you go out to bat for 22 overs, with the required run-rate hovering around nine runs per over, and leave your two most destructive players sitting on their backsides in the pavilion?         
	Ian Bell and Ravi Bopara are both good batsmen, pretty to watch, full of classy touches and nice timing. But are they the kind of players who can slog the ball out of the ground? Absolutely not. They have trained themselves to play correct cricket shots, not to heave across the line. We saw when Andrew Flintoff got going just what could be achieved with a more muscular approach, but his cameo came too late. If you get off to a bad start in a 22-over match, you will always be playing catch-up cricket.         
	I would like to know who is making the decisions in this England team. I suspect it is Kevin Pietersen, as he usually likes to run things his way. But if so, he is showing his inexperience as a leader, as well as a lack of flexibility. Whoever worked out the batting order for Sunday nights game needs their head testing.         
	Even in a 50-over game, like the one at Kanpur last week, I would not go in with Bell and Bopara as openers. I would get Flintoff out there straight away: he is the man with the power to put the Indian bowlers on the defensive.         
	If you look at the great one-day opening partnerships, there is always an element of contrast between the two players. Just think of Sanath Jayasuriya (lovely timing) and Romesh Kaluwitharana (wild-eyed slogger). Adam Gilchrist (wallops you square) and Matthew Hayden (drives you down the ground). Sachin Tendulkar (classic strokemaker) and Sourav Ganguly (mercurial and unpredictable).         
	So when England send out a couple of regulation right-handers to open their innings  and Matt Prior fits into this category as well, by the way  they are simply missing the boat. Again and again in this series, they have got off to sluggish starts. Pietersen needs to learn from the Indians, who go hard at the ball right from the word go. When I say that Flintoff should open, I am not recommending that as a universal solution. Certainly you wouldnt want to throw him away against the new ball in England, where it nips about early on. But that is not so much of a problem in India.         
	The first few overs are the best time to bat. The ball skids on nicely, the fielders are inside the circle, and you have plenty of time ahead of you to pace your innings. Best of all, as far as Flintoff is concerned, you can get your eye in before the spinners come on.         
	I was glad to see Pietersen go up to No.3 in Kanpur  a move I have been recommending for a while. But even then, there was still a lack of clear thinking about the way he played. Facing Harbhajan Singh, he looked to go airborne too early: the result was that he went six and out.         
	Owais Shah is better off in the middle-order in a 50-over game, despite the six-hitting skills he showed on Sunday. He tends not to bat through and get a hundred, which is what you need your top order to do.         
	The worst sin is to get in and then get out in the 40s or 50s, as both Bell and Bopara did in Kanpur. I rate that as even worse than getting out to a good ball early on.         
	If I was coaching England, I would tell Flintoff and Pietersen, I want you two to bat for as many overs as possible. Just play normally, be positive but dont do anything silly, and you will find that runs come at a healthy rate anyway.         
	Now that England have lost the series, they might as well experiment: send Flintoff in early and see what happens. The frustrating thing is that England do not have bad players. They are just going about their business the wrong way.

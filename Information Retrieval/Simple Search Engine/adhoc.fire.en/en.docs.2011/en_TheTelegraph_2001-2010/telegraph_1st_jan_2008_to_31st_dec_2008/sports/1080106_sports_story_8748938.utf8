                                                SA need 185 for victory
                      
	Cape Town: Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul breathed life into West Indies hopes of victory in the second Test against South Africa on Saturday.         
	West Indies were dismissed for 262 in their second innings with what became the last ball before tea on the fourth day, leaving South Africa to score 185 on a deteriorating pitch to win. Gayle, who batted with a broken thumb and with a runner because of a hamstring strain, was last out for 38.         
	Chanderpaul was at the crease for five hours and faced 168 balls for his unbeaten 70.         
	Gayle and Chanderpaul shared 70, the biggest stand of the innings and West Indies biggest 10th wicket partnership against South Africa. Ridley Jacobs and Merv Dillon held the record previously with the 64 they put on in Cape Town in 1998-99.         
	Gayle retired hurt on one when he was hit on the thumb off pacer Andre Nel.           (REUTERS)

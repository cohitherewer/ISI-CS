The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev shares second spot
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev shares second spot
                      
	Shanghai: Australian journeyman Peter Malley fired a first-round 67 to take a one-stroke lead over a clutch of players at the BMW Asian Open on Thursday.         
	The 42-year-old carded six birdies to overhaul morning leaders Henrik Stenson of Sweden, Finlands Mikko Ilonen, Briton Oliver Wilson and Jeev Milkha Singh of India, in sunny conditions.         
	Among other Indians, Delhi lad Shiv Kapur carded 71 to be tied 14th, while Indian Masters winner S.S.P. Chowrasias level-par round of 72 had him at tied 35th. Calcutta pro Rahil Gangjee was tied 51st after returning 73, one shot ahead of Gaurav Ghei and Digvijay Singh.         
	However, Indias top ranked golfer Jyoti Randhawas campaign got off to a disastrous start and his opening round of three-over 75 had him tied 98th, while Amandeep Johl was way down the leaderboard after stuttering to 78 in the $ 2.3 million event sanctioned by the Asian Tour, European Tour and China Golf Association.         
	After picking up four birdies and a bogey in his first nine holes, Malley took the lead in style, sinking a 45-foot putt on the par-four sixth, his 15th hole, giving him every chance of clinching his first European Tour win in seven years.         
	World No. 13 Stenson got off to a flying start with four birdies in his first seven holes, finishing strongly with a birdie on his last after two mid-round bogeys. The Swede will be keen to make amends after losing to Spains Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano in a play-off here two years ago.         
	Fresh from his 25th place finish in the Masters, Jeev struggled to find the mark with his ball striking after taking last week off but made up with an outstanding putting display.         
	Australias Scott Hend, who in the morning charged into first place with an eagle on the par-five second, now trails the leaders by two after a disappointing double bogey towards the end of the round to card a three-under 69.         
	Michael Campbell of New Zealand and Australias Greg Norman are among a clutch of players four strokes off the pace after posting one-under 71s.         
	Twice US Open champion Retief Goosen overcame a horror start to finish five off the pace on even par, holing four birdies to cancel out four bogies in his first seven holes.

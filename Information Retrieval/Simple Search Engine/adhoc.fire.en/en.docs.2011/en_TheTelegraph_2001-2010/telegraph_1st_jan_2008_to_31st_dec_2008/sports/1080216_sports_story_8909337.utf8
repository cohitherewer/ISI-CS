The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Deepak ready to return 
                                                     Deepak ready to return

	Calcutta: Deepak Mondal says his return from injury is just a matter of time.         
	The India and Mohun Bagan defender has been recuperating from a knee injury he had suffered during the Nehru Cup in New Delhi in August. He was operated on by Dr Anant Joshi in September.         
	Im feeling absolutely fine now and what I need more is match practice. I must say that my return to the field can take place anytime, Deepak told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	The defender went to the Mohun Bagan tent and had a brief session at the gym on Friday for the first time since he tore a muscle on his left knee while playing against Bangladesh.         
	Ill sit with the coach (Carlos Roberto Pereira) once the team returns from Ludhiana. Im even keen to play in the IFA Shield but that depends on whether the coach is satisfied with my recover, Deepak said.         
	Mohun Bagan will face JCT in their penultimate match in the I-League in Ludhiana on Saturday.         
	Deepak hasnt yet talked to national coach Bob Houghton, but said he would like to inform the All India Football Federation of his recovery after his meeting with Pereira. He, however, thanked the federation for providing financial assistance for his treatment.         
	Its been a long painful journey. I have been following a fitness regime prescribed by Dr Joshi. Ill have my progress evaluated by him when he comes to Calcutta next month, he said.         
	Deepak had, in 2005, undergone a surgery on his right knee under Dr Joshis supervision.         
	The player, however, lamented Mohun Bagans slide from the title-contenders to also-rans. Pereiras side are placed fourth in the 10-team table with 28 points and the fight for the title is now virtually limited to Dempo and Churchill Brothers (both on 32 points). Deepaks former club, East Bengal, on the other hand, are fighting relegation.         
	According to him, a team needs to persist with a pool of players at least for three to four years to succeed.         
	You can take Dempos example. Apart from Mahesh Gawli and Chidi Edeh, the rest of the squad has remained the same for the past three years. Playing together generates a sense of bonding which is an important factor for success, said Deepak.

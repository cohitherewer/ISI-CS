The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inter regain 4-point lead 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Inter regain 4-point lead 
                  Patrick Vieira celebrates his goal for Inter on Sunday                     
	Rome: Inter Milan restored their four-point lead in Serie A after goals from Patrick Vieira and Mario Balotelli secured a 2-0 win at Atalanta on Sunday.         
	Second-placed AS Romas 3-2 win over Genoa on Saturday had cut the gap to a point but champions Inter returned to form with a clinical display after three league games without a win. Vieiras 21st-minute header was controversial however, after he climbed all over Atalanta defender Maximilano Pellegrino to convert Balotellis corner.         
	With six games remaining, Inter have 72 points and Roma are on 68. Juventus, with a game in hand, are 10 points adrift of Roma in third after losing 2-3 at Palermo in a thrilling late game.         
	In Spain, Barcelona and Villarreal failed to put the pressure on leaders Real Madrid as they dropped points in the Primera Liga on Sunday.         
	Real Mallorca had held the champions to a 1-1 draw on Saturday but Frank Rijkaards Barcelona side drew 0-0 at home to Uefa Cup quarter-finalists Getafe, while Villarreals nine-game unbeaten run ended with a 0-2 defeat away to Sevilla.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Colts to miss key striker today
                                                                                                                                                                                             Colts to miss key striker today
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Colin Toal                           
	New Delhi: Indias quest for a berth in the junior World Cup will begin on Saturday when they take on the mighty South Koreans in the under-16 Asian Football Championships final round, group B match in Tashkent.         
	Having done well in the qualifiers in Saudi Arabia last year, the Indians, trained by British coach Colin Toal, are now hoping to finish among the top three and book a berth in the under-17 World Cup in Nigeria for the first time.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from Tashkent, Toal said it was not an impossible target. But at the same time, it is not right to put pressure on the young boys. I want the boys to remain in a positive frame of mind and enjoy the game, he said.         
	India will miss their key striker Malsawmfelea on Saturday. He is still nursing an injury and I think Abhishek Das will take his place, said Toal.         
	Toals confidence is understandable. In the qualifiers, India scored 18 goals and conceded only two (in the 2-2 draw against fancied Iraq). In Tashkent, South Korea, Syria and Indonesia are in Indias group. Two teams will qualify for the quarter finals.         
	The match against South Korea is likely to be the toughest in the group. The Koreans topped their qualifying group after plundering 28 goals in four games and will look to follow up their 2002 triumph in the competition.         
	Toal admitted that India face a tough test against a Korean side who are reaping the benefits of their impressive youth development programme.         
	As far as youth development goes, Korea have been doing it right for a long time, Toal said. They consistently produce players who have made the national team successful over the last 15 to 20 years.         
	In 2002 they finished fourth in the World Cup. We are up against a team who do the job properly and that is what we want to emulate.

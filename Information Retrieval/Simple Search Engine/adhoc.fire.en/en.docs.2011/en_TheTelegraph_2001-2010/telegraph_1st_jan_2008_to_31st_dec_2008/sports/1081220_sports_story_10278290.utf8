The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Missed a couple of chances:   Moores
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Missed a couple of chances:   Moores
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mohali: England coach Peter Moores said his team would go all out on Saturday morning to get some early success.         
	Speaking to reporters after India ended Day I at 179 for one, Moores said the plan would be to capture as many Indian wickets as possible in the morning session.         
	Well come back tomorrow (Saturday) and the morning session would be crucial, Moores said. We saw the new ball doing a bit in the first 7-8 overs and there was some bounce as well. All three seamers hit the right areas but we missed a couple of chances, he added.         
	Moores felt that England were unfortunate not to pick up at least three wickets despite bowling well throughout the day.         
	Getting (Virender) Sehwag early was a great success and I think our bowlers bowled pretty well throughout the day. Three down would have been the right thing but they (India) played really well, said Moores.         
	The England coach also spoke very highly about Rahul Dravids innings saying he was sure that the Indian batsman would return to form.         
	He is a fantastic player. We have seen him playing very well in England, both internationally and in domestic cricket. A good batsman does not become a bad batsman overnight. We did attack him and could have got him out. Stuart Broad attacked him around the off-stump. The longer he stays, the more settled he gets.         
	On Monty Panesar, Moores said the left-arm spinner brought balance to the England attack. We decided to go into the match with a balanced attack and hence felt having two spinners was important.         
	Monty had little preparation before the Test series and it showed in the Chennai Test. He had plans to prepare in Sri Lanka but because of security issues, things didnt materialise. Anyway, we needed two spinners to put pressure on them, Moores added.

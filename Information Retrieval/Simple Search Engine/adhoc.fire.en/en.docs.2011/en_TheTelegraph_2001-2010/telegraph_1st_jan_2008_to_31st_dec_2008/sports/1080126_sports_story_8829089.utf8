	Calcutta: Owing to inclement weather rendering the underfoot condition unfit for racing, the RCTC stewards have decided to cancel the Calcutta races scheduled for Saturday, according to a notification. 
     
	The stewards also decided not to conduct inter-venue betting operation (ISBO) on the day. However, the ISBO on Sundays Hyderabad races will be conducted as scheduled.

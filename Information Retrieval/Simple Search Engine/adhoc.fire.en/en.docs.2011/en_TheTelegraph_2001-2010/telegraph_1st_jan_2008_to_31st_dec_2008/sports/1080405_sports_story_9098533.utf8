                                                   Hamilton crashes at practice
                      
	Manama: McLarens Formula One leader Lewis Hamilton crashed out of Bahrain Grand Prix free practice on Friday while Ferraris Felipe Massa set the pace.         
	Renaults Fernando Alonso, a winner at Sakhir in 2005 and 2006, collided with Force Indias Adrian Sutil in the days closing seconds.         
	Hamilton lost control of the car on the exit to turn seven in the middle sector of the slippery desert circuit and, with no grip, careered broadside into the tyre barriers with nine minutes of the second session remaining.         
	The 23-year-old Briton, who leads Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen by three points in the standings after two races, stepped out of the heavily damaged car unscathed.         
	Hamilton still set the fourth best time of the afternoon at Sakhir, behind third-placed Finnish team mate Heikki Kovalainen and the two Ferrari drivers who repeated their morning one-two.         
	Massa could be content with his days work after lapping fastest in both sessions.         
	Winner from pole position in Bahrain last year, but still without a point after retiring in Australia and Malaysia, he lapped in one minute 32.233 seconds in the morning and 1:31.420 in the second stint.

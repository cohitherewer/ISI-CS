                                                                                                                                                                                           Stanley upset
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Stanley Rozario is hurt at the way he was shown the door by East Bengal. He said on Friday that he had expected a little more respect.         
	I got the news of my sacking from the media but not from the club management. No club official talked to me before the decision was taken. I came with a lot of respect and expected a little while leaving, Rozario lamented while talking to reporters at the club on Friday.

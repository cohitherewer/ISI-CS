                                                   This will be at the top with the best, says Sachin

  - It will always be special because of the history of the Waca: Sourav 
     LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
              
	Perth: Less than a year after Ricky Ponting mocked Team Indias rather disappointing record overseas, Anil Kumble and Co. left his own team stunned at the Waca. 
    
	That was late on Saturday afternoon and, shortly after the visitors made it 1-2 in the four-Test series, The Telegraph spoke to four senior pros. 
    
	The following (seniority-wise) are excerpts: 
    
	SACHIN TENDULKAR: All Test wins are special, I suppose this will be at the top with the best... The turning point, in my view, was when we got the first wicket (Ricky Pontings) this morning... No, I wasnt worried during the Mitchell Johnson-Stuart Clark partnership. 
    
	SOURAV GANGULY: Its a great win... Probably in the top three overseas, alongside Headingley (2002) and the Wanderers (2006)... It will always be special because of the history of the Waca... Having been part of the XI is a matter of pride. 
    
	VIRENDER SEHWAG: Maine aisi koi tip nahin di (to Kumble)... What happened is that Ishant (Sharma) felt tired after seven overs in the morning, but I told him that he had to back himself for a longer spell... I told the captain that as well... Ishant continued to bowl and straightaway got Ponting. 
    
	MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI: Ive been a member of the XI in some memorable wins overseas... In the West Indies, South Africa, England... But, yes, I suppose this was a special Test... The ninth-wicket partnership didnt worry me as we had enough runs in the balance... Its nice to know that my five dismissals in the first innings is a record against Australia.

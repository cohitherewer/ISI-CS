	Bangalore: Spinner Sunil Joshi did the star turn bagging six wickets as Karnataka scored an emphatic 10-wicket victory over Baroda in their Elite group B Ranji Trophy match on Wednesday.         
	Karnataka, who skittled out Baroda for 169 in their first innings, restricted them to 285 in the second and knocked off the 60 runs required for outright win without losing any wicket.         
	Joshi bagged six wickets for 48 runs off 32.2 overs. R Vinay Kumar took two wickets.         
	Karnataka scored the required runs in 6.2 overs with openers K.B. Pawan (15) and skipper Robin Uthappa (44) completing the task in just 33 minutes in the second innings.         
	Karnataka scored 395 in the first innings.         
	This is the second win for Karnataka this season after they defeated Andhra. Karnataka collected six points, including a bonus and took their tally to 13 from four outings. Baroda remained at two points.         
	Meanwhile in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh bagged five points after outplaying Maharstahra by eight wickets on the fourth and final day of another Ranji Trophy group B match.         
	The hosts had no trouble in overhauling the target of 137 runs after skittling out Maharashtra for 230 in their second innings at Green Park stadium.         
	Maharashtra could add just 31 runs to their overnight total of 199 for seven with Praveen Gupta (3/55) and Piyush Chawla (3/42) polishing off the tail.         
	UPs first innings hero Shivakant Shukla (6) was the early casualty for the hosts as he was removed by pacer Samad Fallah.         
	Tanmay Srivastava (65 not out) and Parvindar Singh (60) then steered UP towards victory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo success a lesson for East Bengal, Mohun Bagan
                                                                                                                   Dempo success a lesson for East Bengal, Mohun Bagan

	The inaugural I-League has proved one thing beyond doubt and that is it is time we stopped living in the past. Both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are the oldest clubs in the country and we are proud of their heritage, but only just.         
	The failure of the two city clubs in the I-League did not surprise me. Among the 10 teams in the fray, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal remained staunchly amateur in a fully professional tournament, without a proven top level management to run the teams successfully.        
	The triumph of Dempo, their second in succession, was on expected lines primarily because they were able to retain the core group of their squad for the past couple of years. In a football team, nothing is more important than a sense of togetherness. This policy has paid dividends for Dempo.        
	It reminds me of the 70s when I used to play my cards in the same manner as Dempo coach Armando Colaco. After I took over East Bengal in 1972, only two of the first team players  Prabir Majumdar and Mohan Singh  left the club next season.         
	Like Armando, I used to be extremely careful in recruiting new players. Subhas Bhowmick and Surojit Sengupta were the only two prominent players I recruited during that period.        
	There are at least half a dozen players in Dempo who played a role on all three occasions when the Goans won the titles. Players like Clifford Miranda, Ranty Martins, Riston Rodrigues, Samir Naik, Valeriano Rebello and Melvyn Rodrigues can make a precise pass with their eyes closed.        
	Not that the Calcutta teams are unaware of this crucial factor in football. When Mohun Bagan kept faith withplayers like Barreto and Debjit Ghosh for years together, they won the NFL three times.        
	This time around, I was saddened by the manner in which the players and the coaches were needlessly sacked. The clubs paid the price for their lack of consistency, impatience and unprofessional attitude. In modern day football, clubs need paid executives to run the show. The days are over when small-time businessmen and politicians could manage the clubs on a part-time basis        
	The I-League this time was won and lost on the combined strength of foreign players and local talent. We in Calcutta failed miserably on both fronts. Neither could we recruit good foreigners, nor did we tap the right talent. Dempo and Churchill beat us hollow with their planning.        
	Goalkeeper Subrata Paul was perhaps the only home-grown talent in Calcutta to leave a lasting impression. I was also impressed by JCTs Karanjit Singh under the bar. The youngster, I was told, was recruited by Sukhwinder Singh from a school level tournament in Mahilpur. The boy has both technique and temperament to play at the highest level for many years.        
	It is good to know that Mahesh Gawli, Climax Lawrence and Bhaichung Bhutia are up for various best player awards once again. They are the backbone of the national team, after all. Apart from these proven stars, some other footballers also impressed me to a great extent.        
	Like Karanjit in goal, I found Air Indias Sanju Pradhan a highly talented player in the midfield. He is a tireless worker and has a perfect sense of timing when releasing and receiving the ball.         
	In the striking zone, my vote goes to Dempos Anthony Pereira, though he was mostly forced to play as a withdrawn forward because of Ranty Martins and Chidi. I wont be surprised if Pereira makes his way into the national side sooner or later.         
	I also have the satisfaction of picking at least one player from Calcutta on my list  Mohun Bagan defender Mohanraj. He has the right technique though he needs to be more consistent.        
	In the end, I have no option but to select Churchill Brothers Odafe Onyeka Okolie as the best player of the I-League though I am not too convinced by his allround technical ability. He tends to go on the right with an outside dodge every time he takes the ball.         
	That makes him a little predictable. But, then, he ended the campaign with an amazing tally of 22 goals. It automatically makes him the champion of champions.        
	The I-league had some great moments and I congratulate Dempo for their wonderful effort, not to forget the vastly improved Churchill Brothers, who ensured the final day remained alive.         
	There were lessons for Mohun Bagan and East Bengal to learn and I am sure they will strive to improve next season.

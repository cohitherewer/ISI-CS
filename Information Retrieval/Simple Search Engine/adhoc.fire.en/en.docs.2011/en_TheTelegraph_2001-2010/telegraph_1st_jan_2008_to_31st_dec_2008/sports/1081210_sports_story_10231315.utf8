The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Thank God, I dont have to bowl to Tendulkar: Ishant
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Thank God, I dont have to bowl to Tendulkar: Ishant

	New Delhi: India paceman Ishant Sharma said he thanks his stars for not having Sachin Tendulkar as an opponent.         
	Sachin Tendulkar is one batsman who is not easy to bowl to. Be it at nets or in the middle, he always bats as if he is playing a match.         
	I am thankful to god that I play in his team. His experience is equal to my age, Ishant said.         
	Other than Sachin and Ponting, my favourite batsmen are Matthew Hayden and Rahul Dravid, he said.         
	Ishant said he was trying to bowl fast consistently but also focusing on maintaining the right line and length to trap the batsmen.         
	I am trying to bowl at 100mph but what is more important is which areas I hit.         
	If you get that speed but the delivery is short- or over-pitched and ball goes across the boundary then there is no use in it.         
	Instead, if I bowl at 140-145kph and swing it, batsmen could be in trouble, he told a TV news channel.         
	I know my limitations and try to be within them, he added.         
	The 20-year-old fast bowler also said he did not believe in experimenting in a match and relies on whatever he practised at nets.         
	You should try in a match only what you have practised in the nets. You should not try new things straightaway while playing for the country.         
	I was not a swing bowler but the one who would hit the deck and even today I try only that, but it is my good luck if ball gets movement, he said.         
	Ishant said he could not credit his success to any one person as Zaheer Khan, Venkatesh Prasad and coach Gary Kirsten have all helped him on various occasions but singled out the South African for his mature approach.         
	Kirsten is a very nice coach. He understands the strength of each and every member of the team, Ishant said.         
	Recently in Delhi, I had dropped Michael Clarke and also could not bat as the night-watchman but Kirsten said in the last one year this is your first mistake. It was your bad day. Tomorrow will be a new day.         
	If your coach helps you come out of a bad phase, he is a good coach, he added.         
	On the England tour, Ishant said: I will try to repeat my performance against the Australians when I had picked wickets as required.         
	We will use the reverse swing weapon against England too.         
	Wed used that against the Aussies. You should know how to reverse swing if you are playing in the subcontinent, he said.         
	In the subcontinent it is easy to bowl if you know reverse swing, you should know how to adapt to the conditions, he added.                 (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | South Africa pull out of Champions Trophy
                                                                                                                                                                                             South Africa pull out of Champions Trophy
            A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES    
	Calcutta/Durban: South Africa withdrew on Friday from the ICC Champions Trophy, scheduled to be staged in Pakistan next month, because of safety and security concerns. England, Australia and New Zealand are expected to join South Africa.         
	A Cricket South Africa (CSA) statement said the decision followed a presentation from an International Cricket Council (ICC) task force headed by the world governing bodys chief executive Haroon Lorgat.         
	The decision was taken after assessment of the presentation as well as the information available from a number of other security reports, including one from the South African government, the statement said.         
	South African Cricketers Association chief executive officer Tony Irish said: This was a difficult decision, but it was the right one. There is nothing more important than the safety of our national team.         
	We appreciate all the efforts of the ICC task team, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the Pakistan authorities and the security consultants.         
	The players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of Pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in September.         
	The ICC chose to remain silent. We know of Cricket South Africas decision and we will not be making any further comment until the board has discussed Champions Trophy related issues on Sunday, the ICC said.         
	The ICC task team held a teleconference on Friday to discuss the feedback received from meetings with stakeholders from Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa.         
	That feedback was discussed and will now be considered by the ICC board, which is scheduled to have its own teleconference on Sunday.         
	The PCB has expressed disappointment at CSAs hasty decision. It is very disappointing. Four countries have now decided against coming to Pakistan. I probably shouldnt bracket the other three (England, Australia and New Zealand) with South Africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what we are hearing they will probably do the same, said Shafqat Naghmi, PCBs chief operating officer.         
	We think the South Africans acted hastily, worse they came out with an announcement at the wrong time.         
	(But) we are still hopeful of hosting the event on schedule and we will make every effort on Sunday to get the other teams with us, he said.         
	CSA president Norman Arendse added that he hoped the ICC would be able to reschedule the tournament.         
	After extensive discussions and frank exchange of views, the board resolved not to send our team at this time to Pakistan.         
	We respect the right of the PCB to stage the tournament and we would urge the ICC to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible.         
	Pakistan opener Salman Butt slammed the teams who have reservations over playing here, saying that the security bogey has been a norm for these sides whenever a tour to Pakistan comes up. Reservations by these teams are a norm whenever a tour to Pakistan approaches, fumed Butt.

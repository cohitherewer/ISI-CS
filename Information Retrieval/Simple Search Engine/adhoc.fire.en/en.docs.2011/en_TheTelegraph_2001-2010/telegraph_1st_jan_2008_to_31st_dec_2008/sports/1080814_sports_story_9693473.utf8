Finally a gold for Yang Wei | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Finally a gold for Yang Wei
                      
	BEIJING, Aug 14 (AP): Yang Wei clapped as he walked past the vault judges, pumped his fists at the crowd and flashed a thumbs-up for the cameras. He even exchanged high-fives with the competition.         
	Denied in Sydney and disappointed in Athens, he is finally an Olympic champion after winning the mens all-around Thursday. It wasnt close, either. Yang finished with 94.575 points, nearly three points ahead of Kohei Uchimura of Japan. Benoit Caranobe of France won the bronze.         
	With each day bringing another gold medal, gymnastics is fast becoming Chinas domain at the Beijing Olympics. And no one is a bigger star than Yang.         
	After eight years of waiting, hes certainly earned it.         
	Today was perfect, quot; he said. quot;I felt tired before the competition, but after it I feel relaxed. quot;         
	He didnt even bother waiting for his marks on high bar, his final event, before taking a curtain call, leaping onto the podium and thrusting his fists in the air while the crowd went crazy. His coach gave him a Chinese flag, and he held it out with pride. Judges took what seemed like forever to post his marks, but that only gave Yang more time to soak it all in.         
	I thought a month ago if I would get this medal, I would be every emotional, quot; Yang said. quot;But Im really not because we won the team gold medal. quot;         
	As the adoring crowd chanted quot;Yang Wei! Yang Wei! quot; he pounded his chest with his fist. When his final mark finally did go up, the crowd went wild and Yang wanted more, cupping his hands to his ears and asking for them to pump up the volume. They did, of course, cheering lustily for the two-time world champion, who just might join Yao Ming and Liu Xiang as Chinas biggest names in these games.         
	The only difference? Yangs already got two gold medals. The other two are still waiting.         
	 quot;We have been working hard for eight years for this medal, quot; China coach Huang Yubin said. quot;Its worth is just below the teams gold medal. quot; There could be more to come, too, for Yang, who qualified for the pommel horse and still rings event finals. Yang was very uneasy going into his third Olympics, quot; said Chen Yibing, Yangs teammate on the China squad that won the team gold two days ago. quot;But he handled it like a champion and I respect him very much.         
	The Americans couldnt add to their bronze medal from the team competition. Jonathan Horton finished ninth and Sasha Artemev was 12th.         
	I never look at the scoreboard and think, Thats it, quot; said Horton, who made a nice climb after finishing the first rotation in last place. quot;Im not a quitter. quot;         
	Yang appeared moved during the medals ceremony, looking down often at the piece of gold he cradled in his hands, but he hammed it up afterward. With the medal now in his hands, he held it up to one group of Chinese fans and pretended he was going to throw it at them.         
	He didnt, of course, laughing and walking over to show it off to another cheering crowd.         
	 quot;The Chinese team is responsible for a lot of peoples dreams, quot; Yang said. quot;This year has not been very good for China. Theres been a lot of disasters, so these Olympic Games, theres a lot of pressure. Its impossible not to be nervous, and its how to cope with the nerves is our job. And right now, I feel very excited. quot;         
	It is Chinas second mens all-around gold. Li Xiaoshuang won in 1996.

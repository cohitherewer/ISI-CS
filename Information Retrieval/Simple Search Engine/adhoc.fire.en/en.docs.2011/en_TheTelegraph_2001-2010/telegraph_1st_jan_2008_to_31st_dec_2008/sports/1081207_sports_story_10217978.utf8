The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hoya flexes money muscle 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Hoya flexes money muscle 
            KEVIN GARSIDE            Oscar de la Hoya                           
	So, boxing in America lies prone on the canvas beneath the raised hand and boot of Ultimate Fighting Championship. The case is made by Paulie Malignaggi, the dancing New Yorker whose lights were doused by Ricky Hatton last week.         
	Two days before their bout in Las Vegas and still no coverage in the New York press, he complained. Maybe that said more about Malignaggi than the game he is in.         
	Meanwhile, the muscled mixed martial artists cast neon stares from hoardings across Times Square. The counter argument is put by Oscar de la Hoya and Manny Pacquiao in the early hours of Sunday. Their welterweight bout in Las Vegas sold out in quarter of an hour and is projected to be the second-richest fight in boxing history.         
	The biggest generated somewhere between $140 million (85.8 million) and $165 million (101.2 million), depending on estimates  figures are never officially disclosed  with $120 million (73.6 million) raised by more than two million pay-per-view buys.         
	De la Hoyas bank balance was $45 million (27.6 million) sweeter. Floyd Mayweather Jnr, who won the bout in May last year, banked $20 million ( 12.2 million).         
	Twelve months ago Mayweather Jnr retired with another multi-million dollar bounty after bouncing Ricky Hatton out of Vegas.         
	The reconstituted Hitman, his pockets loaded with dollar bills to share, awaits the winner of Sundays contest, with Wembley the favoured site.         
	Taxi for boxing? Hardly. A championship contest in UFC has yet to gross $1 million (613,000). Wherein then lies the threat?         
	Barry McGuigan, whose featherweight title fight against Eusebio Pedroza at Loftus Road in 1985 attracted a live television audience of 19 million-plus in Britain, likens UFC to that Saturday night staple, the cab-rank brawl.         
	There is, he says, none of the inherent drama of boxing. The dynamic plays out in bloody balls of interlocking arms and legs.         
	McGuigan acknowledges the fitness and dedication of the athletes, but does not accept that they pose a threat to boxing. Despite appearances, there is little that connects the disciplines.

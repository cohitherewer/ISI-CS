            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) annual general meeting will be held on July 29, it was decided at the CAB working committee meeting on Tuesday.         
	The last date for the submission of nomination for the elections, which will be held on the same day, would be July 21. However, no decision could be reached regarding the groundstaff fiasco.         
	The malis, who are responsible for looking after the grounds including Eden Gardens, have threatened to commit suicide in a letter addressed to the working committee, if their financial demands are not met at the earliest.         
	The letter, sent on Monday and signed by 20 groundstaff, alleged that they have not received payment for five months and hence the only way out for them is to take some extreme step like committing suicide         
	The issue was discussed at the meeting and the CAB president Prasun Mukherjee has said he would look into the matter, a source informed.         
	It was also decided that the annual financial accounts have to be cleared at the trustee board meeting, which has to be reconvened, as soon as possible. Incidentally, the trustee board meeting, scheduled on Monday, didnt take place due to the absence of members.         
	The working committee also nominated Ashok Kumar Dasgupta as the recipient of the CAB lifetime achievement award. Dasgupta is the only living survivor of the Bengal Ranji team that played the final against Holkar in 1952-53.

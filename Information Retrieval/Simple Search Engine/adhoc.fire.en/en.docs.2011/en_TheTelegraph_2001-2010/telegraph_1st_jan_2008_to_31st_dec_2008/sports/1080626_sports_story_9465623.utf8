                                                                                                                                                                                                       Indias 83 win made us hungry: Ramiz
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Ramiz Raja                           
	Karachi: Indias 1983 World Cup win, exactly 25 years ago, made Pakistan hungry.         
	We definitely didnt look at India as role models in one-day cricket, but the 1983 win was significant in quite a few ways For example, it made us hungry We wanted to be the next world champions, former captain Ramiz Raja told The Telegraph.         
	Pakistan tripped in the last-four stage in 1987, but won the edition after that, in Australia-New Zealand (1992).         
	Ramiz, who is also a former chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, was a member of both teams.         
	My own view is that we had the best one-day team in 1987 The balance had been just right After such high expectations, our loss to Australia in the semi-finals (at the Gaddafi) left the country devastated, Ramiz recalled.         
	He added: We did win in 1992, but that was more because of Imran Khans leadership Hed been brilliant in that edition.         
	For Imran, after tasting failure in 1983 and 1987, it was third time lucky as captain.

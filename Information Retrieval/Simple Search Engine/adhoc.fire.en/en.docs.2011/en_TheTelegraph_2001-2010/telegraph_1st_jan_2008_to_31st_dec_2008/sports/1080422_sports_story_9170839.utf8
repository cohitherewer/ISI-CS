The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anfield ready for blues   Benitez, Grant in fight for future 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anfield ready for blues 
  Benitez, Grant in fight for future                   Liverpool players warm up during a practice session at their Melwood training complex on Monday, ahead of the Champions League semi final first leg match against Chelsea at the Anfield. (AP)                           
	Liverpool: The stakes are huge for Rafa Benitez and Avram Grant.         
	A spot in the Champions League final is the prize for the victor of the Liverpool-Chelsea doubleheader. For the loser, theres the real chance of being out of a job.         
	Despite both managers being under pressure from their owners to win the European title, they have praised each other ahead of Tuesdays first semi-final leg at Liverpool.         
	When you analyse Chelseas season you must agree that Avram Grant has done a good job, said Benitez, who won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005. They were in the final of the Carling Cup, they are in the race for the (league) title still and in the Champions League semi-final, so he must be doing a good job.         
	He has good players and he is doing his job really well. I understand why he is under pressure, but that is nothing unusual for a top side. Everybody wants you to win every game and every trophy. That is not easy, but the statistics show he is doing a good job.                     
	Grant is hoping to succeed against Liverpool where his predecessor Jose Mourinho, still idolised by Chelsea fans, failed in the 2005 and 2007 semi-finals.         
	The difference this time is that Chelsea have home advantage in the second leg and visit the intimidating Anfield first.         
	Without the Portugueses famed mind games, the ties will lack the animosity of the previous meetings, but Grant knows he faces a tough tactical battle against Benitez, the master of European play.         
	I think results show it. He beat Chelsea twice when he was 20 points behind (in the Premier League) and in the semi-final of the FA Cup (in 2006), Grant said. I know he knows how to play against big teams and I like him as a person and a manager, but we will give him a battle this time.         
	Both managers have to answer to formidable owners. Benitez is caught in the crossfire of the Anfield civil war between American co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr., while Grants paymaster is Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who wants Chelsea to contest the final in Moscow.         
	For me Roman Abramovich has always been the key for Chelsea, Benitez said. At the end of the day the key players can be a massive difference in games like Tuesdays game but also the whole team have to work very hard.         
	Grant has pinpointed captain Steven Gerrard as Liverpools biggest threat.         
	Gerrard is a great player and a great person, the Israeli said. He is the player of the year in England, and maybe in Europe, because of the influence he has on the team ... If you can bring him to me, I will be happy.         
	Gerrard and his England teammate Frank Lampard should return to their respective midfield roles.         
	Lampard will rejoin Chelsea after missing the last two matches against Wigan Athletic and Everton because his mother was taken ill.         
	Gerrard is also expected to return to the Liverpool team after missing Saturdays Premier League match at Fulham with a neck injury.                     
	The neck is always dangerous so you need to wait, Benitez said. The other day, he wanted to play but he was only able to look to the right, so I told him he could play as a left winger, Benitez joked. Well see if he can turn his head round and look the other way now.         
	Gerrard trained with Liverpool on Monday morning.         
	Liverpools Premier League ambitions ended long ago and Benitez was able to rest star striker Fernando Torres on Saturday.         
	Grant is fighting on two fronts and still forecasts domestic glory. That would realistically require beating league leaders Manchester United on Saturday to draw level on points with two games remaining. The Red Devils have a far superior goal difference.         
	Chelsea also hope that striker Didier Drogba and midfielder Michael Ballack will be available after being sidelined with knee and hamstring injuries.         
	Drogba has also missed Chelseas last two matches while Ballack missed the game at Everton last Thursday.           (AGENCIES)

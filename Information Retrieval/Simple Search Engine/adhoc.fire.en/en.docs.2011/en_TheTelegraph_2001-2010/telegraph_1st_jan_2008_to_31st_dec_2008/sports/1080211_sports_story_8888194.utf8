The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | If Beckhams fit, he plays: Capello
                                                If Beckhams fit, he plays: Capello
                      
	London: England manager Fabio Capello assured David Beckham on Sunday that he would win his coveted 100th cap if he got fit playing for Los Angeles Galaxy.         
	The former England skipper was left out of Capellos first squad for the friendly international against Switzerland last week on the grounds that he was not match fit, having not been involved in a competitive game since November.         
	The 32-year-old has returned to pre-season training with the Galaxy but the Major League Soccer season does not kick off until March 29, three days after Englands friendly against France in Paris.         
	However, Capello insists the five pre-season friendlies that the Galaxy have lined up may be enough for Beckham to feature at the Stade de France.         
	Surely he would have played friendly matches and those would be important. If he is fit and ready to play then he will be part of my team, said Capello.         
	Meanwhile, Capello said he wanted the England team to develop the same sort of fighting attitude as Wayne Rooney.         
	Capello said, I have watched three or four of Manchester Uniteds matches recently and he was always like that. (AFP)

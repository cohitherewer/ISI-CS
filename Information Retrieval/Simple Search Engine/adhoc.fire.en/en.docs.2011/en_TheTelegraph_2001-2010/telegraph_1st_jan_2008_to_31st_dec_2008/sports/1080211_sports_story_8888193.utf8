The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal woes not over yet 
                                                  East Bengal woes not over yet 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Iyomi Mboyo (left) and Okolie Odafe at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Churchill Brothers moved up to second spot in the ONGC I-League beating a 10-man East Bengal 1-0 in their Round XVI match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	Mboyo Iyomi scored the all important goal in the 76th minute, helping his team breath down leaders Dempos neck and sending East Bengals fight against relegation back into a tailspin.         
	Churchill are now on equal footing with Dempo with 32 points but the latter still top the 10-team table by dint of a better goal difference. East Bengal remained rooted in the eighth place with 15 points, ahead of Viva Kerala (12) and Salgaocar (10). Two teams will be relegated.         
	East Bengals hopes in the match were seriously dented inside the first half-an-hour when midfielder Jayanta Sen received the marching orders from referee A. Arjunan for a dangerous tackle on Naoba Singh in the 28th minute. With a man short, Manoranjan Bhattacharjees side first had to readjust themselves to the changed scenario, then struggled to win the midfield battle and, eventually, found wanting in containing the opponents on the break.         
	That East Bengal goalkeeper Subrata Paul was adjudged the Man of the Match spoke volumes of the pressure the home teams defence had to withstand during the match.         
	It all began on a positive note for East Bengal. There were no Edmilson Marques and Asim Biswas in the attacking line-up, but Manoranjan made his teams intention clear with a series of attacks in the beginning. Syed Rahim Nabi was back in the strikers role and threatened to test the rivals with support from behind.         
	The Churchill defence, however, held firm, and after Jayantas exit, had a relatively peaceful job. Churchill, like a team on an away challenge, relied on counter-attacks. Mboyo Iyomi and Okolie Odafe started exploring the East Bengal backline as the home team retreated, swapping their intention for a win with the draw.         
	Soon after the break, Odafes right-footed attempt went over and he failed to capitalise on a Mboyo pass from the right.         
	Making the situation graver for East Bengal, Alvito DCunha left the field having suffered a hand injury. He was replaced by Chandan Das.         
	East Bengals worst fear came true 14 minutes from the time when Mboyo headed a centre from Naoba into the goal.         
	The hosts had a chance to equalise after three minutes, but Chandans back-volley missed the target.

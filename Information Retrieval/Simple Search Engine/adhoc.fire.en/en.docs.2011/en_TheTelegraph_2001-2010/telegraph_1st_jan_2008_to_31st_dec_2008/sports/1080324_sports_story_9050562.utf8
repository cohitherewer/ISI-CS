The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jacques Kallis: I dont play cricket to make headlines 
                                                     Jacques Kallis: I dont play cricket to make headlines 
  - If the bowlers have a good tour, were in with a big shout, says SAs senior-most pro       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kallis                                 
	Chennai: South Africas senior-most pro Jacques Kallis interacted with the media in general at the Chepauk on Sunday. Later, separately, he briefly spoke to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Having had somewhat of a quiet tour of Bangladesh, South Africas last engagement before coming to India         
	Didnt get too much of a chance to bat there, the guys hogged it all upfront! But I performed well with the ball... There were different issues, not that I was out of form... Ive come here confident of doing well in the (three-Test) series.         
	On taking to the series without a practice match         
	Ideally, we wouldve preferred more time at home and then a warm-up game, but we didnt get that opportunity... Given the circumstances that we had, this is the ideal way... To have come straight from Bangladesh (the last ODI was on March 14), and made it one tour... I dont think the guys would then have been as focused and as keen as theyre now... Even if you go home for a couple of days, it allows you to recharge batteries... Bangladesh arent the toughest opposition in the world, but the tour was a warm-up for India...         
	The intensity to be expected from South Africa         
	Weve got big challenges this year... This tour, followed by the one to England and, then, Australia... The guys are a lot more motivated and geared up than they were in Bangladesh... This series is one of the big three and were working towards doing well in each one of them.         
	Quota system-driven controversy over the squads selection         
	Its been frustrating over the past year or so... The most frustrating part, for us players, is that the people getting involved are the people who shouldnt be getting involved in the selection process... There are selectors to select sides and, if it stays that way, then the players will be happy. As for the team (playing XI) thats chosen, we dont have a say in that... Weve got to get on with the job.         
	Whether South Africas attack is better suited for Indian conditions this time than during the last Test series (2004-05) in India         
	Our attack has performed well in the past year, with some of the less experienced guys gaining in experience... Weve got an attack that can take 20 wickets, something thats needed to win Test matches... For the first time in a long while, the strength lies in our bowling and if the bowlers have a good tour, were in with a big shout.         
	On whether, for the batsmen, the adjustment in India is more mental or skills-related         
	Bit of both... The skills got tested in Bangladesh on spinning wickets where the balls kept low... So, from a technical point, the batsmen are well prepared... On the mental side, obviously, youve got to bat time... Its a tough ask, because of the hot and humid conditions... At the moment, it could be more of a mental adjustment.         
	Whether India is the hardest country to tour         
	The hardest is Australia, because of the conditions being different... Then, its India and England... The three most toughest places to tour... But weve gone away victorious (Test series in 1999-00) and if we put in the hard work, then the results will be there.         
	Team Indias performance on the recent tour of Australia         
	It was surprising the way India played... In the past, India would be good at home, but not so good when away... You need experience and youth and India, I think, got the combination right (in Australia)... Theyve got some good bowlers coming through and there arent too many weaknesses in the side.         
	The Chepauk wicket         
	Looks like its going to be a spinners paradise.         
	Impact made by certain players         
	Look, one or two players dont win you a series... Teams do.         
	Dearth of quality allrounders         
	Sadly, if we carry on playing the amount of cricket weve been playing, then therell be an even bigger decline in numbers... Theres too much of a workload... There has to be a plan, otherwise allrounders will either have to become Test players or one-day players, not both... Somebody like Irfan Pathan has improved a lot, though hes more a bowling-allrounder... He has a bright future ahead of him... Personally, Ive always tried to help produce a decent result for my country... I havent, of course, been playing for accolades.         
	[According to the International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings, Kallis is the No.1 allrounder in Tests.]         
	Having worked with Paddy Upton, who is now with Team India         
	More than the cricketing stuff, its about getting life organised... Hed come up with good ideas for preparing for a game... Im sure hell be good for the Indians... He has a different way of thinking...         
	Whether, with the advent of the Indian Premier League (IPL), money could become the No.1 attraction         
	Its tough to turn down good money... Somewhere along the line therell have to be sacrifices... Where that is, well, its up to the individuals as players... Where Im concerned, Ive still got a few years left in me... Maybe, the ICC has to integrate the IPL into the international calendar... Who and how I dont know, but maybe a formula can be arrived at. Somebody could (first) work out the ideal number of Tests and ODIs every year.         
	Finally, on not getting the recognition he should be getting from all quarters         
	(Laughs) Ive never been bothered... Thats never ever been my concern... I dont play cricket to make headlines... I play because Im passionate about the game... Im also not driven by records... I know Ive got 29 Test hundreds, but thats it.

                                                Kanpur to host Test vs SA
                      
	Mumbai: Kanpurs Green Park stadium, which has not hosted a Test match in more than three years, will be venue of one of Indias three Tests against South Africa in the home series scheduled from March 16, the BCCI announced Wednesday.         
	The other two matches during the March-April series will be held in Ahmedabad and Chennai, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said after the tours programmes and fixtures committee meeting chaired by president-elect Shashank Manohar.         
	The last Test at Green Park was in November, 2004 when it hosted Australia. But the venue did not host another because of a dispute with the state government.         
	Matters got resolved and the half-a-century-old Test venue hosted a ODI during the last visit by Pakistan on November 11. It will now play host to a Test match against South Africa again.         
	The committee also decided that Bangalore, Nagpur, Delhi and Mohali will be the venues for the four-Test series against Australia to be held in October-November.         
	The exact schedule of the two series will be finalised later. (PTI)

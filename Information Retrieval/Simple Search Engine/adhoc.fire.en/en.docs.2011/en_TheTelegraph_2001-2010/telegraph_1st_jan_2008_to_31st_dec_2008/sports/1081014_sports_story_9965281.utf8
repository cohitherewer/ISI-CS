	Melbourne: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan has urged international teams to stop cancelling their tours to his strife-torn country on security grounds, saying the terrorists would never target cricketers for fear of losing support among masses.         
	I can understand (the tour cancellation), but having said that I also know that cricketers would never be under any threat from terrorists, the cricketer-turned-politician was quoted saying by an Australian newspaper.         
	Terrorists rely on support from the masses because thats where they get their recruits, and cricket is a game which is loved and theres passion in Pakistan.         
	The terrorists know that if a cricket match is bombed, theyve had it. The public will just turn against them, he added.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Board has been grappling with one cancellation after another due to international teams security fears.         
	The Australian team postponed its March-April tour before the Champions Trophy was also re-scheduled for next year due to security fears. Later the West Indies womens team also refused to play there.           (PTI)

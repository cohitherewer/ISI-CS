The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Still happy with my boys: Shabbir
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Still happy with my boys: Shabbir
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagans Jose Ramirez Barreto scores from the penalty spot against East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans title win on Friday after drawing against East Bengal renders Saturdays clash between Mohammedan Sporting and United SC, virtually a dead rubber. At least for Mohammedan Sporting. Shabbir Alis men are assured of second place in the league table after East Bengal finished their campaign at third on 25 points from their 14 games.         
	Shabbir Ali speaking after the completion of the days derby said, I have nothing to say I had earlier said that after the 1-1 draw against Mohun Bagan (in the return leg match), for us the league title was a remote idea. Had we won that day the story could have been different.         
	Their (Mohun Bagans) late equaliser was contentious, Shabbir said.         
	Asked whether motivation might be a problem for his side when they take on United SC on Saturday at the Salt Lake Stadium, Shabbir said, It wont be a problem, my boys have performed admirably all season and I am proud of them I am still happy with their performance.         
	Earlier in the evening Bhaichung Bhutia had expressed worries about IFAs scheduling of the local league which left Mohammedan Sporting to play on the final day, knowing the result of the Mohun Bagan-East Bengal tie. Bhaichung said: Its important that all matches end together in a league. Talking from a players perspective I feel motivation might be a factor for Mohammedan Sporting tomorrow Its very unfair for the Mohammedan Sporting players who have done so well all season.         
	Both Shabbir Ali and Karim Bencharifa agreed that the return leg tie between their sides was the turning point in their respective league fates.

	Vadodara: Sitanshu Kotaks half-century failed to save Sauarashtra from losing to Uttar Pradesh by 48 runs and move into the final of Ranji Trophy Super League on Monday. 
    
	Chasing 162 to win, Saurashtra were all out for 113 in the first hour of Day III play. 
    
	Requiring only 69 runs to wrap up the issue on the day, Saurashtra managed adding just 20 runs to overnight total of 93 losing their last three batsmen. 
    
	The overnight batsmen Kotak (52) and Kamlesh Makwana (13) had added just 10 more runs to their the eighth-wicket partnership when Pravin Kumar broke the pair by claiming Makwana. 
    
	Pravin (4/39) then castled S. Jobanputra (0) and Kotak perished to Sudeep Tyagi (4/42) sealing the fate of Sauarashtra. 
    
	Kotak added 11 runs to his overnight total to get his half-century, which included four hits to the fence. 
    
	The 40-run stand between Kotak and Makwana helped Saurashtra take their second innings total to three figures. 
    
	UP will now meet the winners of the other semi-final match between Delhi and Baroda in the final to be held in Mumbai from January 16. 
    
	Meanwhile, splendid batting by Rakesh Solanki (96) and an swashbuckling unbeaten 86 by Yusuf Pathan helped Baroda score 281 for six in their second innings against Delhi on Day III at Indore. 
    
	They now have an overall lead of 209 with four wickets left. Delhi had a first innings advantage of 72 after they compiled 271 in reply to Barodas total of 199.

	Resuming at the overnight score of 140 for two, Gujarat lost wickets at steady intervals. They lost nightwatchman Mohnish Parmar with the addition of only eight runs before Modi (overnight 66) and Niraj Patel (14) stitched together a stand of 45 runs for the fourth wicket. 
    
	Modi, who batted for more than seven hours in his 317-ball innings hitting 18 fours in the process, and Jay Desai fell in quick succession to make Gujarat 219 for six.

	Railways, in their second innings started on a poor note, with opener Siddharth Joshi flopping for the second time in the match, before ending the day at 14 for one. Bangar (0 off 25 balls) and night watchman Murali Kartik (9), the team captain, were the unbeaten batsmen at stumps.

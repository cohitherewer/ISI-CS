	Calcutta: The ruling group in the Cricket Association of Bengal will not enjoy Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees backing in the July 29 annual general meeting.         
	Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Monday he had spoken to Bhattacharjee regarding the CAB elections and was under the impression that the chief minister is not throwing his weight behind any candidate this time.         
	He is neither concentrating on the CAB elections nor is he projecting anybody. The CM wants to keep a safe distance from the controversies, Chakraborty said.           (PTI)

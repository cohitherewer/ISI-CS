Phelps ties Spitz with 0.01 to spare | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Phelps ties Spitz with 0.01 to spare
            KAREN CROUSE                      THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN            1. 400m  individual  medley  on  Aug. 10, 4:03.84  (WR)             2. 4x  100m  freestyle  relay  on  Aug. 11, 3:08.24  (WR)            3. 200m  freestyle  on  Aug. 12, 1:42.96  (WR)            4. 200m  butterfly  on  Aug.13, 1:52.03  (WR)            5. 4x  200m  freestyle  relay  on  Aug. 13, 6:58.56  (WR)            6. 200m  individual  medley  on  Aug. 15, 1:54.23  (WR)            7. 100m  butterfly  on  Aug. 16, 50.58  (OR)          
	Beijing: After 3,200 meters and 16 races, Michael Phelpss pursuit of Mark Spitz came down to a single stroke. With five meters to go in the 100-meter butterfly final on Saturday, Phelps realised he had misjudged the finish.         
	He had two choices: glide to the wall, kicking like crazy, or take an extra, awkward half-stroke. To his left, Milorad Cavic was having the race of his life. Phelps, who was seventh at the turn, had no room for error.         
	Most swimmers would have impulsively chosen to glide, but Phelps proved by the slimmest of margins what sets him apart. Following his instincts, he took an alligator-arm stroke and touched the wall. Cavic, a California-born Serb, hit the timing pad in full glide.         
	Both swimmers spun around and stared at the video screen. In the moment it took the scoreboard to unscramble the results, the tension inside the National Aquatics Center was palpable.         
	Phelps was timed in 50.58, a personal best and an Olympic record. Cavic, a California-Berkeley graduate, was one-hundredth of a second behind (50.59). Phelps had caught Spitz by a whisker. It was his seventh gold medal, tying Spitzs record haul from the 1972 Munich Games and earning him a $1 million bonus from Speedo, one of his sponsors.         
	Im really at a loss for words, Phelps said. Im excited. I just dont know what to say.         
	Serbian swimming officials had plenty to say, protesting the result. Officials from FINA, the sports international governing body, broke down the video to the 10-thousandth of a second, then upheld Phelpss victory. Its very clear that the Serbian swimmer touched second after Michael Phelps, FINA referee Ben Ekumbo said.         
	The race awakened echoes of the mens 100 butterfly final in 1988 when another Berkeley product, Matt Biondi, lost a late lead and the gold, by the same wafer-thin margin, to Anthony Nesty of Suriname.         
	Cavic, 24, described it as the most devastating loss you can have at the Olympics. He added: People will be bringing this up for years. Theyll say, You won this race.         
	He was just getting warmed up. If we got to do this again, he said, I would win it.         
	Cavic will never be confused with a shrinking violet. Before this week, his claim to fame was getting himself barred from the European championships for wearing a T-shirt on the medal stand that read, Kosovo is Serbia.         
	On Friday, after posting the fastest time in the semi-finals, a 50.92, Cavic said it would be good for the sport if Phelps was thwarted in his bid for eight gold medals. Phelpss coach, Bob Bowman, read Cavics quote Saturday morning and debated whether to share the comment with Phelps.         
	He had a flashback to the Athens Games in 2004, when Phelpss margin of victory over Ian Crocker had been four-hundredths of a second.         
	 This race also figured to be tight, as only 35-hundredths of a second separated the top four qualifiers. Bowman decided to play the quote card.         
	When Bob told me, I was like, okay, Phelps said. When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything.         
	Phelps has won every which way this week  by large margins in the 400m individual medley, 200 freestyle and the 200 individual medley and by standing on the deck in the 4x100 and 4x200 freestyle relays. He even won the 200 butterfly with his goggles filled with water.         
	It boggled Phelpss mind to think he had won back-to-back Olympic golds in the 100 butterfly by a total margin of five-hundredths of a second.         
	I guess my two finishes over the last four years have been pretty good, he said.         
	For the first time in these Games, Phelps failed to set a world record in a final, falling 18-hundredths of a second shy of the three-year-old mark held by Crocker, who was fourth in 51.13.         
	 On this day, touching out Cavic and drawing even with Spitz was plenty good enough.         
	It seems like every day Im in a dream world, Phelps said. Sometimes you have to pinch yourself to see if its real.         
	In a joint interview on NBC, Spitz told Phelps, What you did tonight was epic, adding later, I never thought for one moment you were out of that race.         
	During Phelpss news conference after the race, a reporter said to him: Obviously you are the king. Im sure youre going to have eight medals. Whats your next dream?         
	The woman was speaking accented English, but the 23-year-old Phelps looked as if something had been lost in translation.         
	 He never counts his victories before they are won, not even when his eighth gold is riding on Sundays 4x100 medley relay, which the Americans have never lost at a non-boycotted Olympics.         
	Its not over yet, said Phelps, who will swim third in the relay, on the butterfly leg. I really think the Australian team looks great for the relay. Its going to be a great race.         
	Phelps loves the chase. If he passes Spitz, he will not rest long. There is always another goal to go after.           NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

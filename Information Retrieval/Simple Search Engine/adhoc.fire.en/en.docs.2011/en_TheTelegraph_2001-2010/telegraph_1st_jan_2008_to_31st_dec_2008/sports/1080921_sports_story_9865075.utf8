  - Defending champions will be nine points behind Chelsea if they slip up today       HENRY WINTER             Cristiano Ronaldo                                 
	No one does defiance better than Sir Alex Ferguson. In spikily upbeat mood on the eve of Sundays visit to Chelsea, Manchester Uniteds manager argued that the only team who could possibly rival his double-winners for creativity were Melchester Rovers and even Roy Races luminaries lack the awesome foursome of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Dimitar Berbatov and Carlos Tevez.         
	As for the Stamford Bridge groundsman who rucked with Uniteds players as they warmed down on the pitch last season, Ferguson predicted Patrice Evra and company would be met with a combine harvester this time. Adversity brings out the mischievous and the determined in this remarkable Scot.         
	He talked of the cynicism in John Terrys foul on Manchester Citys Jo last weekend, of how managers must stand up to meddling owners who want to use them as mere fitness coaches. Ferguson even claimed that his Berbatov-enhanced squad was stronger than the group who conquered England and Europe in May.         
	These are hardly the darkest days for United, not with Berbatov, Rooney and Ronaldo ready to storm west London, but even Ferguson accepted that this seasons start has not been the smoothest. Following last weekends defeat at Liverpool, United will be nine points behind Chelsea if they slip up Sunday.         
	We cant afford to lose, declared Ferguson, sitting in his Carrington lair on Saturday. We want to get a really good win and get this show on the road again. Weve a collection of talents. Theres no doubt about the character of my team.         
	What they have to do, like all Manchester United teams, is recover from a bad defeat. Its not what you would call a daunting task for United to go there (Stamford Bridge), with the ability we have in our team. Chelsea respect that. They know fine well that United can go there and win.         
	Asked whether any other team could have been so creative, Ferguson eventually suggested: Melchester Rovers? We do make chances. Thats credit to us. We will hit form and we will hit goals. Ronaldo should guarantee that. The moment the Footballer of the Year stepped on to the pitch, Villarreals defence dropped deeper. It was quite marked, that, Ferguson reflected. When Ronaldos really, really buzzing and he wants the ball and attacks people with speed, theyre forced to go back. He was on fire, the boy. He was really revved up to perform really well. Hes bursting to play, nibbling in my ear all the time.         
	Slightly cagily, Ferguson admitted he could accommodate all his four main attackers, although he stressed the team would be sacrificing a bit. Unless he began with two holding midfielders and then unleashed Rooney, Tevez and Ronaldo behind Berbatov in a 4-2-3-1 formation, Ferguson envisaged disappointing one leading light.         
	The name of the game is to win. If Ive got a stronger squad than last season  and hopefully I have, having brought in Berbatov  then that (omitting one star) is the right thing to do. Improvement is what were looking for  and Berbatov was signed for that reason.         
	His knee problem eased, the Bulgarian should start while Ronaldos pace could trouble full-backs ordered to push up by Luiz Felipe Scolari. We have done our homework, Ferguson observed. But the only difference I can see to Chelsea under Scolari is Deco, whos a different type of midfield player to what theyve had.         
	Theyve relied on the power and athleticism of (Michael) Essien in that role. But now they have a different type of player  diminutive, clever, a nice footballer. We looked at Deco when he was at Porto and he went to Barcelona for a large sum of money. Was it 24 million? (Deco eventually went for 21 million euros). We werent going to get involved in that kind of value. But having players like (Paul) Scholes may have been the reason.         
	Ferguson, who enjoyed a glass of wine with Scolari at a Uefa coaches gathering last week, was keen to clear up one misunderstanding over a pre-season view he expressed about Deco, Michael Ballack, Frank Lampard and their mature ilk. I didnt say they were an old team. I said they were an experienced team. I said  and its true  that when players go into their thirties, you dont get a lot of improvement out of 30-year-olds.         
	Disciplinary matters briefly entered Fergusons thoughts, notably the decision to rescind Terrys red card for hauling down Jo. By the letter of the law it wasnt a goalscoring opportunity, so thats how the FA have decided it. What people were surprised with was the cynicism of the foul more than anything else.         
	More fireworks may go off Sunday, keeping the FA disciplinary department busy. The dispute between the Chelsea groundsman and Evra is being heard by the FA on Oct 2. Obviously weve got a fair case, Ferguson said. Patrice was disappointed at events and it will be interesting to see what they have on the pitch after the game. Theyll have a combine harvester on this time! But we just have to make sure we dont get involved in that.         
	Always supportive of his players, this strong union man is similarly supportive of fellow managers, particularly those under pressure from interfering owners. Attending a League Managers Association fund-raiser at Wembley on Thursday, Ferguson voiced his fear that we have owners that will (make managers) become project managers, or basically just fitness coaches who will determine who out of the 16 are the fittest on the day.         
	Ferguson added: We need strong, capable managers who can stand up against those that try to change the principles of the game. Ferguson has never been afraid to stand up and be counted, particularly in adversity. Uniteds players will need their managers defiance at the Bridge.

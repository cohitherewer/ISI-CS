	Taunton: Timid batting and fickle weather put paid to Indias hope of staying afloat in the five-match series as England women thumped them by eight wickets via Duckworth-Lewis method to take an unassailable 3-0 lead here. India made 126 for two.         
	Chasing a revised target of 99 from 21 overs, England lost just two wickets before romping home to ensure the series win. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers to bank on Gilchrist
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chargers to bank on Gilchrist

	Hyderabad: Buoyant after registering their first win of the tournament, the Deccan Chargers (Hyderabad) will take on Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League (IPL) with both the sides depleted owing to the exit of their Australian imports.         
	Captain V.V.S. Laxman would be under considerable pressure as the fans in his native city expect some fireworks from him.         
	His highest score in the series so far has been 37.         
	The team will be at a disadvantage as Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds has left to join a training camp ahead of Australias tour of the West Indies.         
	South African opener Herschelle Gibbs is likely to replace him.         
	In the absence of Symonds, retired Australian star Adam Gilchrist, Laxman, Pakistans swashbuckler Shahid Afridi and Gibbs will shoulder the responsibility.         
	Gilchrist hit a scintillating century in the match against Mumbai Indians and Chargers bank heavily on him.         
	The Kings XI Punjab, meanwhile, has won two of the four matches they have played so far and look strong with Kumar Sangakkara, Yuvraj Singh, Simon Katich and James Hopes doing well with the bat.

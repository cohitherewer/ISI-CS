The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kaiser warns England
                                                   Kaiser warns England
            GARETH A DAVIES                       
	St Petersburg: Franz Beckenbauer believes there are merits in the Premier Leagues proposal for a 39th League match abroad, but cautioned the British football authorities that it would be unwise to go against Fifas wishes.         
	But he suggested a different tack  such as exporting the FA Cup from Wembley to different cities around the world  such as China. Its a good idea to play such important games such as the FA Cup final in Beijing or in Shanghai or wherever instead of at Wembley, said the former German World Cup-winner, who also speaks from the authority of being a Fifa executive committee member.         
	However, he warned in no uncertain terms that Englands attempts to bid for the 2018 World Cup will founder unless there is absolute co-operation with Fifas feelings on matters of expansion.         
	Beckenbauer, speaking in St Petersburg at the Laureus sports awards, said: If Fifa is against the idea to put Premier League games outside the country, I wouldnt do it. The decision on who gets the World Cup 2018 will happen very soon and England are one of the favourites. At this time I wouldnt be so cocky to go against Fifa. In this period, if you want to be the World Cup host you have to get hand-in-hand with Fifa  otherwise you dont get the chance.         
	He (Fifa president Sepp Blatter) realises these games disturb the market but it is great promotion for important games in the Premier League being played outside the country. The idea is not bad. But I dont know if it works. Manchester United and Arsenal have a lot of fans but how do they get to Sydney? Its a good idea to export your football but practically I dont know.         
	Beckenbauer also believes imposing quotas of foreign players could be a solution to what he sees as a general malaise in European leagues. England is suffering because of the situation, and in Germany its the same. In all the major leagues in Europe they have the same problem and the youngsters have problems getting through because most of the teams prefer to buy foreigners.

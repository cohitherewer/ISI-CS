                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gony to join squad on Monday
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Manpreet Singh Gony                           
	Calcutta: Punjab seamer Manpreet Singh Gony was Saturday included in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Bangladesh after Sreesanth was ruled out due to a side strain.         
	Due to non availability of Sreesanth, it was decided by the selection committee to send Manpreet Gony for Bangladesh tri-series, Niranjan Shah, BCCI secretary, said in a media release.         
	Sreesanth was yesterday assessed by Dr Kinja at Bangalore. He has got a left-sided external oblique strain. He would require about 2 weeks for recovering from the current situation and getting back to his normal bowling routine, the press release added.         
	Gonys departure will, however be delayed because of a visa problem. He didnt join the rest of the players on Saturday and will be flying out of New Delhi on Monday.         
	Sreesanth will now undergo a two-week rehabilitation programme and will be available for the Asia Cup in Pakistan.         
	He will be available for Asia Cup 2008 to be played in Pakistan. Sreesanth rehabilitation will be organised at NCA in Bangalore, the press release said.         
	Gony said a successful IPL stint has made him a better bowler and he was looking forward to give his best in his first assignment.         
	IPL has given me great exposure. You rarely get a chance to bowl to so many world class batsmen and this experience has made me a better bowler. (Chennai Super Kings) coach Kepler Wessels made a slight adjustment to my action, helped me hit the deck harder and bowl in the right areas.         
	But I will look to have a fresh start when I bowl in the tri-series, where I will also get the opportunity to bowl a longer spell which should help me show my abilities, Gony said. It is like a dream come true. It was always my dream to play for my country. .

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Trouble over Games Village project
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Trouble over Games Village project
                      
	New Delhi: New Delhi could lose the right to host the 2010 Commonwealth Games if organisers are forced to shift the athletes village from its present location, a senior Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) official said on Tuesday.         
	The Games village being built on the banks of the Yamuna is the subject of a legal case after a petition raised environmental concerns over the project.         
	The Delhi high court last week asked an expert to submit a report on whether the village, to house around 8,500 athletes and officials, should be allowed at the spot.         
	The CGF coordination commission held a meeting to review the preparations and chairman Austin Sealy said the village would be the best built for a Commonwealth Games. However, the Federation is aware of an issue affecting the village is presently before the courts and therefore considers it inappropriate to comment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal lays siege to No. 1
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nadal lays siege to No. 1
            MARK HODGKINSON            Nadal                           
	Probably the only person in Majorca who does not want Rafael Nadal to win another tennis title is his dentist. One of Nadals quirks is that he likes to bite into the trophies he wins, and he was at it again over the weekend as he crunched his teeth into the glass prize he received at the Toronto Masters.         
	Nadal has been leaving bite marks across the tennis world as, by winning on the Canadian cement, he became the third youngest man in history, behind Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors, to collect 30 singles titles.         
	While Borg and Connors both held the world No. 1 ranking, Nadal has not yet. But that could soon be about to change, as the 22-year-old could earn the points at the Cincinnati Masters this week to move past Roger Federer into pole position         
	Nadal has to win at Ohio if he is to earn alpha male status, and Federer, who has topped the rankings for almost four-and-a-half years, would have to go out early. But, if Nadal does not overtake Federer in Cincinnati, there will be further opportunities at the Beijing Olympics and the US Open in New York.         
	The top ranking matters. Federer has not enjoyed suggestions that Nadal is already the unofficial world No. 1. . Right now, there is hardly the width of an Ohio breakfast pancake between the pair, who both have opening-round byes in Cincinnati.         
	Every player wants to be No. 1, no? said Nadal, the Wimbledon champion. I would love to be No. 1, but I am No. 2 right now. Im very happy to be No. 2, because with my titles, with my points, in a normal situation I, well, would have been No. 1 before. So I think I have to be happy, very happy anyway, if I am No. 1 or No. 2, as if I am No. 2 its because in front of me there is an amazing player like Roger.         
	Federer, 26, has won 55 career singles titles, but he has added only two to that tally this season, with tournament victories on the clay of Estoril and on the grass of Halle. Nadal, though, has won seven trophies so far, with four clay-court titles at Monte Carlo, Barcelona, Hamburg and the French Open, a pair of grass court wins at Queens Club and Wimbledon, and then one on a hard court in Toronto, demonstrating once more that he can win on any surface.         
	Nadal has not been beaten on any surface since he lost his opening match at the Rome Masters to Juan Carlos Ferrero in early May, but that match should perhaps have an asterisk by it as it was played at a time when he was in such discomfort from blisters that even treading on the floor of his hotel room made him wince.         
	By defeating Germanys Nicolas Kiefer in straight sets in the Toronto final, Nadal extended his unbeaten run to 29 matches, and he has 61 wins this season to Federers 43. There now seems to be an inevitability about the Majorcan bumping Federer down into second place.         
	 Federer, who lost his opening match in Toronto to Frenchman Gilles Simon, said that he is trying not to go crazy over the ranking.         
	What Rafa has been doing is terrific, said the Swiss. Theres always pressure, but I expect to win my matches and tournaments. Ive had that for four or five years. Its nothing new. Its only that the No. 1 ranking is in more danger now than in the past.         
	I focus on the big picture, prepare well and try not to go crazy over the ranking. I know that theres a lot of talk about it now, and Rafa does deserve the credit.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi will play doubles together for the first time after the Doha Asian Games when India take on Japan in the Asia-Oceania Group I Davis Cup tie here from April 11.         
	The AITA, which on Wednesday announced the squad, expectedly retained Leander Paes as the captain. In the last tie against Uzbekistan, Paes was injured and was the non-playing captain.         
	With Paes back on court, the AITA has reduced the squad to four. Somdev Dev Varman, who made his debut against Uzbekistan, has been dropped. Prakash Amritraj and Rohan Bopanna are the others.         
	Eiji Takeuchi will lead the Japan side, the other members being Kei Nishikori, Go Soeda, Takao Suzuki and Satoshi Iwabuchi.         
	Both teams are expected to be in the capital by Sunday.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Air India produced a flawless performance to expose the chinks in Mumbai FCs armour for a 2-0 win in the sixth round of the I-League football tournament at the Cooperage here on Saturday.         
	The hard-workingSoccor Velho put Air India ahead in the 20th minute with a strong header off a free kick from Nepoleon Singh before Subhash Singh extended the lead with a powerful right-footer 12 minutes later.         
	We had planned something and it worked out well, a happy Air India coach Bimal Ghosh said.         
	We played well against Mohun Bagan and East Bengal (in the earlier rounds) also but in terms of planning, this was our best match.         
	Velho and Surojit Roy once again displayed their abundant energy levels with their manning of the midfield and creating the chances by running down the flank, Subhash Singh and Kailash Patil made a perfect combination up front to trouble the Mumbai FC defence.         
	So much so that Air India hardly missed their inspirational captain Emmanuel Ovieghara who had to sit out with a double booking.         
	Air India now move to second position in the league table with 11 points.         
	Agencies add: In another I-League match in Margao, Edeh Chidi and Sushil Kumar Singh helped Mahindra United beat Vasco 2-0.

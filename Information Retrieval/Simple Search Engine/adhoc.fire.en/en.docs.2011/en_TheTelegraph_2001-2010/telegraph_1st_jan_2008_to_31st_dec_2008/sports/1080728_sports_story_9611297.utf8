	Double may hurt Bolt, feels coach   
	London: Usain Bolts coach is worried that going for the sprint double in the Beijing Olympics could hurt the 100m world record holders chances of winning his preferred 200m event. The Jamaican sprinter has said he wants to compete in both, but is leaving the final decision to coach Glen Mills. You have to ensure that you are not going into it just because there is a chance of glory, you have to go there knowing that your chance is solid, Mills said after Bolts 200m victory at the London Grand Prix. I think he will get a medal in both, its a question of winning.  
	Narangs hope         
	 New Delhi: Last time his rifle went off at the Beijing Shooting Range Hall, it fetched him a bronze. I have been to the Beijing Shooting Range Hall in April and its huge, breathtaking. I have good memories of the place and hope it remains the same, Gagan Narang said before leaving for Malaysia.         
	Amirs choice         
	 London: British star Amir Khan has chosen as his new trainer the man who once looked after the Cuban boxer who beat him for the gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Khan believes Jorge Rubio is the right man to help him in the next phase of his career.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Our character is now on test: Sourav Ganguly
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Our character is now on test: Sourav Ganguly
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -   World of sport throws up challenges such as the one now faced by us: Captain         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            Sourav Ganguly    
	Calcutta: Two superb back-to-back performances from captain Sourav Ganguly helped arrest the Kolkata Knight Riders slide earlier in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Two defeats in a row, though, have put all the pressure back on the team. And, of course, on Sourav himself.         
	With the heat well and truly on, Sourav wasnt inclined to have a full-fledged one-on-one in the lead-up to Tuesdays clash with the Shane Warne-captained Rajasthan Royals. He did, however, take a few questions from The Telegraph  continuing from where hed left off in Mumbai last week.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The Knight Riders being in an unenviable situation         
	Yes, were in a corner We need to win all the remaining matches Its a tough position to be in but teams do end up in such situations Our character is now on test The world of sport throws up challenges such as the one now faced by the Knight Riders.         
	On moving up and down the standings         
	One likes consistency but this is bound to happen in a competition of this nature.         
	Experience of captaining in a Twenty20 tournament         
	It has been quite an experience, really, with the competitiveness and the want to win Plus, the team has had highs and lows The ultimate, of course, is captaining your country when youve got to try and win session after session.         
	Time it took to settle down as captain         
	I must confess I was nervous in the first couple of matches Remember, my only real previous exposure to Twenty20, and limited at that, was during my short County stints in 2005 (Glamorgan) and 2006 (Northants) I had to learn, get used to setting the appropriate fields Took me two-three matches Id thought I was through with captaincy in 2005 (when Rahul Dravid replaced him at the helm of Team India) Thought I was done and dusted with the captaincy In the IPL, Ive had to start all over again Was back to doing things, as captain, on my own         
	Captaining in Twenty20 as opposed to other forms         
	Youve got to think one step ahead all the time The pace is such that you cant take even a breather Field positioning is critical as is the approach while batting. (After a pause) In some ways, Twenty20 has advantages For example, bowlers remain fresh and the batsmen can give it their all because its such a condensed game The momentum has to be maintained for a short span only.         
	The supremely passionate manner in which he led during the home match against the Delhi DareDevils, also Shoaib Akhtars comeback game         
	One is always passionate Always involved That was a do-or-die match in the sense that victory wouldve placed us strongly in the push for a last-four berth It was Shoaibs decision to bowl that third over, when he got two wickets to tally an amazing four Id wanted to hold him back, but hed been very keen.         
	Having been the one to pitch the strongest for Shoaib at the February 20 auction         
	(Grins) Yes There was some resistance from some in the franchise, quite natural because of what had been going on between him and the Pakistan Cricket Board, but I knew most teams would find it very tough to handle his four overs I mean, even if he heads straight to the ground after waking up, he can still bowl at 90 mph Thats a telling speed Having played for well over a decade at the highest level I know that genuine pace makes a difference.         
	His first interaction, as captain, with Shoaib         
	Told him that I had faith in him That it was an important competition for him as the world would be watching him         
	Handling players of different nationalities         
	Theyve been professionals Havent had a problem.         
	Relationship with coach John Buchanan         
	It has been enjoyable Ive begun to understand him and he has begun to understand me We listen to each other and do whats best for the team Each coach has his way of functioning Johns probably more patient Is certainly quieter.         
	Many seeing the IPL as a good platform to get noticed         
	Its a platform, yes, but the skills required even for a 50-over game are very different Its altogether more different in Test cricket Its good when players get noticed, but the (India) selection for Tests and ODIs should be on the basis of ones performance in those two forms only. Things shouldnt be confused.         
	On owner Shah Rukh Khan         
	(Smiles) Hes the bigger star Hes been great (Co-owners) Jay and Juhi Mehta too I understand Juhi goes to the Kali temple before every match and, so, Im not the only one to visit temples!         
	Whether hes learnt something from Shah Rukh         
	Cant say Ive learnt, but I envy his lifestyle Envy the way he manages his time.         
	Finally, whether Warnes presence will add needle to Tuesdays face-off against the Royals         
	No comments.

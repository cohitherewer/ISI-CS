            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Beijing: It was a nightmare for Anju Bobby George as she crashed out of the Olympic long jump event with three foul jumps at the National Stadium here on Tuesday.         
	Anju injured her ankle during the trials and was unable to post a single leap in the qualifying round here and finished with a NM (no mark) tag against her name. With the automatic qualification for the final set at 6.75m, Anju needed a performance way above what she has been achieving in recent months to make the grade. She has not moved beyond the 6.55m mark this year.         
	Once I injured the ankle in trials, I knew what lay in store. After all, this is the Olympics and I have put in a lot of effort just for this occasion, the Keralite said.         
	In wrestling, Yogeshwar Dutt failed to hold on to a lead, losing 1-2 in the third and final round of the quarter final tie in the 60kg free style category against Kenichi Yumoto of Japan.

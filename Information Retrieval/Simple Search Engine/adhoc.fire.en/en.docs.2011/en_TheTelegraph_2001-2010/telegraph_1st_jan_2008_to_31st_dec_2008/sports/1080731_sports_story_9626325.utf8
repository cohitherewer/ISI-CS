	ANECDOTE         
	Perec flees         
	Just a few days before the womens 400m, which would pitch double Olympic champion Marie-Jos Prec against Aussie favourite Cathy Freeman, the Frenchwoman quit Sydney and the Games claiming to have been hounded by fans and press alike. Freeman went on to win gold in the event while Perec has only recently emerged from self-imposed isolation.               
	EXPLOIT         
	American sprint queen Marion Jones made it into the Sydney Olympics record books with an astounding haul of five medals, three of which were gold, but some would say Joness performance in Australia fell short of what might have been expected of her.               
	SUMMARY         
	Marion Jones set herself the target of winning five titles at Sydney 2000 and fell only marginally short of that goal by plundering three gold and two bronze medals. She was magnificent in both the 100m and 200m and also lifted gold in the 4x400m relay. But in the long jump and the 4x100m she had to settle for third, which was hardly a disappointment.         
	Another great fell short of the mark hed set himself, Australian swim sensation Ian Thorpe with his size 17 flipper-feet. Thorpedo as he became known, was unexpectedly blasted out of the water by Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband, who won the 100m and 200m freestyle golds.         
	Thorpes only individual gold came in his favoured 400m freestyle event but he also left with two team golds.         
	There were many other great Olympians in action, too. American speed king Maurice Greene fullfiled his promise by winning the 100m.         
	Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie was once more crowned 10000m king, and the Czech Republics Jan Zelezny won his third javelin gold.

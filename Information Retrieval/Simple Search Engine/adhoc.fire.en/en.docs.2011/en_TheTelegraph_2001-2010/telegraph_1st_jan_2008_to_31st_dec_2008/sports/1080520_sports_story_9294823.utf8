	New Delhi: Sports minister M.S. Gill on Monday warned the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) of stern action if steps were not taken to clean up the doping mess that has become part and parcel of the sport these days.         
	According to sources, the minister, who met IWF president Harbhajan Singh, said that it was not only about weightlifting but his ministry would come hard on drug offence in any discipline.         
	Gill, who was upset after two lifters tested positive for drug use in the last few days, also told the IWF president that he would review the entire process after two months.         
	The minister pulled up the IWF for not furnishing statement of accounts in time. Harbhajan Singh promised to furnish all audited accounts in the shortest possible time.

                                                   Southee is Player of Tournament

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: New Zealand bowler Tim Southee was named Player of the Tournament for his overall performance in the ICC Under-19 World Cup. 
    
	According to an ICC release, Southee finished on 11 points, two ahead of his nearest rival despite having played one game fewer than some of his rivals. 
    
	The points were allocated by the umpires at the end of each match with three points for the Man of the Match, second choice getting two points and the third receiving one. 
    
	Southee saw stiff competition from Sri Lankas talented batsman Sachith Pathirana, who ended with nine points. Another point back was Nepals inspirational captain Paras Khadka and Virat Kohli of India . 
    
	Had Virat Kohli won the Man of the Match award in the final, he would have snatched the Player of the Tournament award from Southee although they would have ended on the same number of points. 
    
	Kohli would have been declared the winner on account of more Man of the Match awards during the tournament.

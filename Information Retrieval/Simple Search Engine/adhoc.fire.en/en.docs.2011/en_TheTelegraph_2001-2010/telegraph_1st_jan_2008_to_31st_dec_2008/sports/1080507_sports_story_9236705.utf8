The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Should have left Chelsea last season: Mourinho
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Should have left Chelsea last season: Mourinho
            JEREMY WILSON                      
	Jose Mourinho has revealed his regret at turning down the chance to leave Chelsea at the end of last season and manage what he described one of the greatest clubs in Europe.         
	In an interview with a Russian newspaper, Mourinho also said he rejected a very tempting offer with England following the departure last year of Steve McClaren.         
	I made a mistake not to leave Chelsea at the end of last season, he said. I had an offer from one of the greatest clubs in Europe but I preferred to stay in London because I promised the fans that I wont leave on my own initiative, and four months later I was fired. Now I understand that I probably shouldnt have missed such an opportunity.         
	After leaving Chelsea, Mourinho emerged as the peoples choice to manage England but ruled himself out. I had a very tempting offer but I rejected it, he said.         
	Asked whether the team he mentioned was England, Mourinho said: Yes. Working with a national team isnt interesting for me. I like training on a daily basis, games every week or even better three times a week. Im not 60. Im only 45. So it wasnt the point that it was team England. Working for any national team would mean rejecting something much more interesting.         
	The Football Association has admitted holding talks with advisers of others candidates but stressed that Fabio Capello was the No. 1 choice and the only candidate they interviewed.         
	Mourinho is now adamant that he wants a club job in either Spain or Italy, but says that he will be supporting Chelsea in the Champions League final against Manchester United.         
	He added that he did not feel any envy at Chelseas progress in reaching the Champions League final. I do not accept such feelings, he said. In my opinion only weak people, losers, have such feelings. So what if Chelsea win the Champions League? I won it too. So what if they win the Premier League or the cup? I won that too.         
	Since I left the club I have never said a word about why. There are no problems between me and Roman Abramovich and our relations are completely clear. We keep in touch and we do not forget the time we worked together.

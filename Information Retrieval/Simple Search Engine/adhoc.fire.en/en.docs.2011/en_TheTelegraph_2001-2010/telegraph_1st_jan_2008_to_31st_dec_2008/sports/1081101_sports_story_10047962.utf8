The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav too in line of fire
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sourav too in line of fire
    - Its time somebody asked Gilchrist to shut up, says Harbhajan           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                                  
	Calcutta: Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson were expected to turn the heat on Team India, but that job is actually being done by retired gloveman Adam Gilchrist.         
	Marketing strategy or whatever, but Gilchrists comments on Sachin Tendulkar and the Monkeygate affair (January this year) in his just-released autobiography, True Colours, caused a furore and the icon was himself forced to react.         
	Usually, Sachin lets his bat do the talking.         
	Of course, Gilchrist had to issue a clarification, a damage control exercise really, but hed achieved what Ricky Ponting and his men couldnt in the first two Tests of the current series: Get under Sachins skin, partly at least.         
	While the Sachin-specific stuff was leaked before the books release, at an impressive function in Sydney this week, an agency has now quoted extracts relating to the controversial Nagpur Test (2004-05 season) which question the-then captain Sourav Gangulys commitment.         
	Harbhajan Singh too has been targeted by Gilchrist, whod been standing-in for an injured Ponting.         
	When I got to the middle, Ganguly was not there. (Rahul) Dravid was in the blazer, ready for the toss... Wheres Sourav? I said. Rahul couldnt answer definitively. Between the lines I perceived that Sourav might have pulled out from fear of losing a home series.         
	Harbhajan was out of the Nagpur Test with a flu, which he seems to have contracted when he saw the grassy wicket... I still dont know to this day what was wrong with Ganguly and Harbhajan...         
	There was speculation that Ganguly was quarrelling with the head of cricket in Nagpur and a rumour that a spicy pitch might be prepared out of spite or revenge against the captain...                   Adam Gilchrist       
	Sourav, who was contacted in New Delhi on Friday evening, declined to react till hed read the bit about him. Harbhajan, though, almost exploded when The Telegraph got through to him in Jalandhar.         
	Gilchrist shouldnt be using fellow cricketers to sell his book... Im sure there are other ways of doing that Its time somebody asked him to shut up... I suppose Gilchrist needs to get his head examined, Harbhajan, who had to miss the ongoing Kotla Test owing to a left toe injury, said during the one-on-one.         
	Harbhajan, incidentally, is at home and not with Team India in New Delhi owing to his nanas demise.         
	While Souravs withdrawal from that Nagpur Test did raise eyebrows then (despite an injury in the right groin-thigh region), eyebrows had also been raised at the conduct of the hosts, the Shashank Manohar-headed Vidarbha Cricket Association.         
	Manohar, who is now the Board of Control for Cricket in India president, had been smarting from leader Sharad Pawars defeat (in the Board elections) at the hands of Jagmohan Dalmiyas casting vote.         
	Pawar triumphed at his second attempt, some 14 months later, in November 2005.         
	The buzz was that Manohar wanted to get even with Dalmiya through Sourav, at that time seen as his blue-eyed boy. And, so, a wicket to suit the Glenn McGraths was prepared.         
	Belatedly, an effort had been made by some to take the sting out of the wicket, but Manohar didnt budge.         
	 Nobody can order us to remove any grass, hed insisted.         
	Clearly, it was intra-Board feuding at its worst  one which hit national interest for a six  and its no surprise that the Australians made the most of home-like conditions and thrashed Team India by 342 runs.         
	That win, in fact, gave Australia the series.         
	Much water has gone down the Nag, Swan and Hooghly rivers since, but its probably pertinent to recall that Sourav had missed the next Test (Mumbai) of that series too.         
	Four years on, the fourth and final Test of this series will be in Nagpur, from November 6.         
	Given the spicy stuff in his autobiography, Gilchrist wont only be unwelcome in the vicinity of the Indian dressing room, but in Manohars fiefdom as well.

	Beijing: Chinese police need to improve their methods to make sure that security checks for next months Olympics are civilised and convenient, the countrys top security official was quoted on Monday as saying.         
	Citing security as the single most important factor in hosting a successful Games, authorities have instituted a raft of measures, including putting a 100,000-strong anti-terrorism force in place and setting up checkpoints on roads into Beijing.         
	But many travellers have complained about being subjected to repeated checks, which security tsar Zhou Yongkang said police needed to cut out.         
	During the Olympics security work, we should not only stick to strictness and details, but also ensure civilised and convenient inspections for people, the official news agency quoted Zhou as telling policemen at a checkpoint.         
	Police should improve their methods and processes to avoid repeated checking and shorten the checking duration, ensuring convenience for people, he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting pleased with progress in transition

	Bridgetown: Australia captain Ricky Ponting, pleased with 2-0 series victory over the West Indies secured with victory in the third Test on Monday, said they remained a team that knows how to win.         
	The retirements of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Justin Langer and Adam Gilchrist, who had helped Australia dominate world cricket for more than a decade, led some to question whether Pontings side would be able to stay at the top of the sport.         
	Im really happy. Everyones been talking about this transition phase that our teams been going through, Ponting told reporters.         
	Its right, we are going through that sort of transition, weve lost six or seven players in the last 12 months. But...were still beating teams. Were still winning Test matches and winning series. Were probably not demolishing sides like we might have two years ago, but were grinding teams down and winning Test matches, and were doing it well.         
	Thats a really pleasing thing for me and the rest of the guys going forward.         
	Ponting said Australias domestic competition ensured players reached the Test side with the right mentality.         
	I think its pretty good in our state system. I think a lot of the guys come into international cricket knowing a certain way to play their cricket. You couldnt ask for a better start for (wicketkeeper) Brad Haddin and (new spinner) Beau Casson and even Simon Katich coming back in the side. Im really happy with where were at, at the moment.         
	The Tasmanian singled out Katich, who scored centuries in the second and third Test, pace bowler Stuart Clark, who bowled consistently and took crucial wickets, as well as allrounder Andrew Symonds had all shown improvement in this series.         
	Meanwhile, Gayle will be rested for Fridays Twenty20 International against Australia.         
	Gayle has been sidelined to allow the nagging groin injury that has affected him over the last two months more time to heal.         
	The big left-handed opener however, has been named in the 14-member squad for the ODI series which starts next Tuesday.

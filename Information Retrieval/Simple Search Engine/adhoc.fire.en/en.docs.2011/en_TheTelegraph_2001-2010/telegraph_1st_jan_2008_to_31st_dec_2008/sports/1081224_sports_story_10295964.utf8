The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nothing to do with fashion: Beckham
                                                                                                                                                                                             Nothing to do with fashion: Beckham
            Jim White               David Beckham                           
	Fashion, insisted David Beckham over the weekend, had absolutely nothing to do with his decision to decamp to Milan. His arrival in the worlds couture capital at the start of a brief loan spell from Los Angeles Galaxy was, he was anxious to make known, entirely a footballing issue. It was a nice sound bite. A shame his wife wasnt listening. As he was speaking, Mrs Beckham was photographed around the city in three different frocks in the space of 15 hours. And by some extraordinary coincidence, all of them feature prominently in the latest collection of her designer label.         
	As English sports most celebrated export was revealed to Milans supporters on Sunday, there was such a yawning distance between sport and marketing that the only surprise was that the stadium announcer did not warn the San Siro patrons to mind the gap. Perhaps the chap was otherwise distracted attempting to generate a bit of noise.         
	As the Englishman strode on to the pitch, flanked by squads of children wearing Milan shirts with his name and squad number on the back, barely a ripple of applause disturbed the atmosphere. But then the fans in the stand were unlikely to be much exercised by the arrival of a 33-year-old midfielder who has spent the last 18 months plying his trade in a backwater.         
	The previous day, things had gone somewhat more satisfactorily for those who organised this strange little loan deal. Beckham was revealed to members of the Italian press who were treated to a slide show of him in his new Milan kit.         
	As always, he looked terribly smart, possibly the only player in the modern game to enter the field of play (or at least the photographers studio) with his shorts not just pressed, but starched.         
	It was the sight of him immaculate in red and black which gave a clue to what is going on here. The event was organised by Adidas, for whom Beckham remains a potent marketing vehicle.         
	Whatever the clubs president Adriano Galliano might say, the odds are that Saturdays fashion show is the only time he will be seen at any length in red and black.         
	The team manager Carlo Ancelotti has not been exactly effusive about his new signing. The most optimistic analysis of Beckhams immediate prospects might place him sixth in a pecking order that currently reads Kaka, Gennaro Gattuso, Andrea Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf, Mathieu Flamini, Emerson and Massimo Ambrosini.         
	No-one involved can really expect us to believe this is anything other than the most cynical of commercial transactions. Except, perhaps, Beckham. A good run here, he hinted, would force Fabio Capellos hand as the 2010 World Cup appears on the horizon. Besides, he said, a long-term move to Milan would suit the party who really matters in all this.         
	Shes always loved the city since she started coming here for fashion weeks. he said of the decision-making in the Beckham household         
	Just remember, though. Its nothing to do with fashion.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

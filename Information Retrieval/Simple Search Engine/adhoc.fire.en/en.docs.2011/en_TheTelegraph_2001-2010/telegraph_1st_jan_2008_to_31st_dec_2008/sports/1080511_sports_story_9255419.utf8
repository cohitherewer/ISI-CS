  -  REVIEW OF IPLS WEEK NO. 3
                              
	 The 104 -run partnership between Kolkata Knight Riders David Hussey and Wriddiman Saha was the best ever for the sixth wicket in Twenty20 cricket. In fact the pair became the first to be involved in a three-figure stand for this wicket in Twenty20 history. The pair bettered the previous best record of unbroken 98 between Robert Key and Matt Walker for Kent against Middlesex at Beckenham in July 2006. The pair also went past the previous best stand for this wicket in Indian Twenty20  81 between Ali Murtaza and Rahat Elahi for Uttar Pradesh against Madhya Pradesh in Jaipur, April 2007.         Rajasthan Royals Sohail Tanvirs 6/14 against Chennai Super Kings in Jaipur now represents the best ever bowling figures in Twenty20 history. He thus became only the fifth bowler to take six wickets in a Twenty20 game. The previous best was 6/15 by Sanjeewa Abeywardene for Panadura Sports Club against Sri Lanka Air Force Sports Club in Colombo in October 2005. The best figures by an Indian in Twenty20 was the 5/10 by Iqbal Abdulla for Mumbai against Haryana in Ahmedabad last season.  
	 The five ducks in Bangalore Royal Challengers innings against Kings XI Punjab in Bangalore was the second worst by any team in Twenty20. Only Kenya (73) managed more ducks (6) against New Zealand in Durban during the World Twenty20 meet in September 2007. For the record, the only other domestic team to register five ducks in the same innings were Burgher against Chilaw in Colombo in the Sri Lankan domestic Twenty 20 competition in March last year.         
	 Chennai Super Kings last ball win against Delhi Daredevils was the 23rd such win by any team in Twenty20 cricket. Incidentally it was the only fourth such victory by any Indian team in Twenty20. Last season Services beat Jammu amp; Kashmir in Delhi, Rajasthan beat Vidarbha in Jaipur and Tamil Nadu beat Kerala in Visakhapatnam via the last ball.         
	 Kolkata Knight Riders David Hussey has tied with South African Martin van Jaarsveld of being the most capped player in the history to Twenty20 cricket. Both have appeared in 52 matches for various domestic teams.         
	 Kolkata Knight Riders Brad Hodge, who is one of the three players with over fifty Twenty20 matches, became the first batsman to appear in over 50 matches without registering a duck. Hodge has so far batted in 47 innings.         
	 Bangalore Royal Challengers Cameron White and Deccan Chargers Scott Styris have both managed to hit exactly fifty Twenty20 career sixes. They join Kolkata Knight Riders David Hussey (58 sixes) to become the only third batsmen in its history to hit fifty or more sixes during their Twenty20 career.

	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar and Roger Federer will soon be seen together in an advertisement to promote social causes. 
    
	Not just Sachin, the Switzerland government and the National Basketball Association (NBA) of the US have sought the BCCIs help for using some other cricketers for the same purpose. 
    
	The Swiss government approached us and wanted Sachin to do an ad with Federer for a social cause. Sachin was thrilled and agreed immediately, said Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, the BCCIs CAO. The NBA has also approached us and want to utilise our players for furthering social causes.

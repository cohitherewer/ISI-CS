The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cant take them lightly: Hussey
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cant take them lightly: Hussey
  - Australian cautious about Knight Riders chances against Deccan Chargers today       A CORRESPONDENT            Shoaib Akhtar and Murali Kartik at a city hotel prior to their departure for Hyderabad on Saturday. Picture by Gautam Bose                                 
	Hyderabad: David Hussey feels Thursdays victory against Bangalore Royal Challengers has restored the confidence in the teams ranks after four successive defeats in the Indian Premier League.         
	I think we now have a genuine chance of reaching the semi-finals. The win has given back the confidence we lost. Were now confident of a better show, Hussey said at a news conference.         
	The allrounder, the most consistent performer in the Kolkata Knight Riders ranks, said they were not taking Deccan Chargers lightly.         
	One cant take the Chargers lightly despite their poor run so far. They have Adam Gilchrist, Herschelle Gibbs, Shahid Afridi and Scott Styris. Any one of them can win a match singlehandedly.         
	Hussey said that the team had enough talent to make up for the loss of Brad Hodge. Hodge is a fine player. His loss is big for any team. But I think Salman Butt can replace him efficiently enough, Hussey said.         
	The Australian said he has been impressed by Shah Rukh Khan. Before every match, he comes and says make your best effort and dont bother about the result. Hes very down to earth. Hes like a friend to all of us. I dont regret the attention he attracts. On the contrary, it takes a lot of pressure of the cricketers, Hussey said.         
	It is now more or less certain that Shoaib Akhtar will have to sit out for another match. On the eve of their match against Deccan Chargers, the Knight Riders team management refused to commit on Shoaib Akhtars availability.         
	The Pakistan pacer did participate in the fielding drills and physical conditioning, but did not bowl at nets on Saturday.         
	Shoaib is obviously in the 14. The final XI will be chosen tomorrow. When a team wins, the team for the next match is chosen according to the need of the situation. So well take a call on him tomorrow. Well have to wait to see him in action, said Laxmi Ratan Shukla.         
	Asked if Shoaib was fit enough to play, Shukla said: Yeah, he practised with us today. There is no problem with his fitness.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | RP could be released for Ranji tie
                                                                                                                                                                                                       RP could be released for Ranji tie
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            R.P. Singh                           
	Chandigarh: A request from the team management not to change a combination (playing XI and the reserves bench) on the verge of a superb win, made the selectors retain the squad for the last two Tests, on Monday.         
	The Tests will be played in New Delhi, from October 29, and in Nagpur from November 6.         
	However, one learns that Rudra Pratap Singh could still be released for the UP versus Andhra Ranji match in Kanpur from November 3.         
	Its possible that RP will be released on the third day of the third Test, well before UPs first match, a source told The Telegraph.         
	Apparently, the selectors were also looking at releasing a second player, possibly Subramaniam Badrinath (for the Tamil Nadu-Maharashtra match in Nasik), but coach Gary Kirsten said no.         
	Kirsten, it seems, argued that the team would have to do with kids if more than a couple of substitutes were needed on the field. Badrinath, in particular, is a fine fielder too.         
	The strength of the India squad is 15.

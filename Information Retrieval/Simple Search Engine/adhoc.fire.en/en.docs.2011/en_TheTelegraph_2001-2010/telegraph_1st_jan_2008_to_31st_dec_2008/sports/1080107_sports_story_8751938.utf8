                                                   Sack duo, say ex-players

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Steve Bucknor and Mark Bensons horrendous umpiring resulted in a chorus of protest back home as well. 
    
	The following are excerpts from what some city-based former India players told The Telegraph (alphabetically): 
    
	Devang Gandhi: India really played well, dominating the entire match especially in adverse conditions. But very little you can do when playing against a 13-man side. The umpiring was abysmal  the worst ever Ive seen in my entire career. My only question is that why was the third umpire not consulted? Why was technology not used in Sourav and Dravids cases. Ricky Ponting amp; Co. also did not play in the right spirit. 
    
	Ashok Malhotra: This has been one of the most disgraceful umpiring since neutral umpires have come into play. This is not biased umpiring, I would say this is pure incompetence. One has past his prime while the other one does not deserve to be in the Elite Panel of Umpires. You can see from the body language and from the face that Mark Benson does not deserve to officiate in a Test match. He does not have the temperament How on earth would you justify his decision to ask a captain (Ricky Ponting) whether the player is out or not when you have leg umpire and third umpire. And about Steve Bucknor, his official age is 61. God knows, hes 61 or 65 or 70. And for India, if Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid were given not outs we could have drawn the match. I think the ICC would do a great job if they sack both Bucknor and Benson right away. 
    
	Pranab Roy: This is very sad. Atrocious decisions. I can understand if there were a couple of bad decisions. But we could have still saved the match. Few things went in favour of India like the rain interruptions and secondly, the declaration. Ricky Pontings side batted one hour extra, giving India more time. We could have batted well especially after doing so well in the first innings. About umpires, the ICC should sack the duo. Steve Bucknor has passed his best. Its high time that he should retire. Hes 60-plus which is not a good age for umpiring. Ive done umpiring and I know how difficult it is. Now the ICC should say Bucknor Thank you very much.

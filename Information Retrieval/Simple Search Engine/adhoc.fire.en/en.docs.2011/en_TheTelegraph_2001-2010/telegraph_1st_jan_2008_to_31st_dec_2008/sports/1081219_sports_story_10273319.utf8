The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dravid tipped to drop down order 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dravid tipped to drop down order 
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Mohali: The string of poor scores may finally take its toll. Rahul Dravid may have to do away with his No. 3 slot in the second Test against England beginning at the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) Stadium on Friday.         
	The former India captain has scores of 51, 5, 39, 11, 11, 0, 3, 3, and 4 since the home series against Australia. He, however, enjoys the full backing of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Gary Kirsten.         
	The thinktank believes his experience does come in handy and this slump is just a passing phase.         
	Dhoni, however, indicated on Thursday that Dravid might come down the order. As of now its not confirmed... But then, shifting Rahul to No. 5 and asking VVS (Laxman) to bat at No. 3 seems okay at times. VVS has scored runs at No. 3 and it would be easy for Rahul too, the captain said.         
	Dhoni, however, was quick to add he was yet to take a final decision on the issue. It can also boomerang, he said.         
	If VVS gets a good ball and gets out There is already pressure on Rahul Once you lose three wickets, the pressure is always on No. 5 batsman. Its really tough to tackle that. At least, batting at No. 3 gives you the freedom to play your natural game.         
	Dravids poor form aside, India seem to be bubbling with confidence and are hoping to sweep the two-Test series after the win in Chennai. The team looked relaxed at nets and went through their paces in a cheerful mood.         
	There is no doubt that India would be depending on their strong batting line-up to vanquish the Englishmen as they did in Chennai, which was dominated by the visitors for the first three and half days.         
	While Dhoni said his team was doing everything right at the moment, Kevin Pietersen admitted that dismissing the Indian batsmen was extremely difficult.         
	While India are expected to retain their winning combination, the England captain said he would name his final eleven on Friday.         
	The visitors are still undecided on whether to include batsman Owais Shah. They disappointing performance of Monty Panesar, which according to Pietersen was because of lack of match practice, is proving to be a big worry.         
	With fast bowler Stuart Broad fit after missing the Chennai Test, the visitors may choose between Graeme Swann and Panesar, or drop Steve Harmison or James Anderson.         
	It is pretty much the full works, Pietersen said. Obviously you have got guys who have come on the trip who are ready to go.         
	We just need to make a decision on which is the best team to try and win a Test match, play positive and win, he added.         
	But then, all said and done, the turnout in the final Test could once again be low as not many ticket seekers could be spotted in and around the stadium on Thursday.         
	The last time India played at Mohali was against Australia and the poor attendance in the stands prompted the ICC chief executive to rue the future of the longer version of the game.

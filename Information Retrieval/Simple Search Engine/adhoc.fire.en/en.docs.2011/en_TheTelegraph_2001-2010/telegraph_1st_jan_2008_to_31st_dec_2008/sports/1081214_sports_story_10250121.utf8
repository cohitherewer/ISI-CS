The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Weve got to make the advantage count: Paul

        OUR CORRESPONDENT            Indian players celebrate the fall of an England wicket at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday. (AFP)                                 
	Chennai: Paul Collingwood is hoping that England will be able to build on the advantage they gained at the end of the third day of the opening Test.         
	So far weve done pretty well But in India Test cricket seems to start very slowly and then days four and five are the really important ones, he said.         
	Weve got ourselves into a good position but this is when weve got to make it really count tomorrow and the next day.         
	Collingwood said he was not unduly worried when he joined Andrew Strauss at 43 for three. We had lost three quick wickets and the game was on a bit of a knife-edge so it was important that we got a partnership going.         
	We managed to get in, and you need a bit of luck to get in over here We hung in and built a partnership which is hopefully going to be a crucial one.         
	Today I felt great. I went in with a bit more positive intent and got a couple of boundaries early and felt comfortable at the crease.         
	I felt that I let the ball come on a bit better in this innings and after getting a bit of bad luck in the first innings I wanted to make it count today.         
	Collingwood said he was satisfied with his batting.         
	Its very satisfying, you know, to play this kind of innings. Pressure innings are the ones thats the most satisfying. As a player you do realise the situations, realise when you got to make a contribution and make it count.         
	Today was one of those situations. I had a bit of luck early in the innings.         
	 It takes only one slight mistake against the spinners when you first come in and you can be out before you know.         
	Batting with Strauss also helped, said the former England ODI captain.         
	Hes played pretty much everything off the back foot, he has let the ball come on, Hes really a great example for the rest of us.         
	Collingwood said the pitch was showing signs of decay.         
	It is starting to play a few tricks. Its breaking up a little bit Certainly a lead of around 350 would be good.

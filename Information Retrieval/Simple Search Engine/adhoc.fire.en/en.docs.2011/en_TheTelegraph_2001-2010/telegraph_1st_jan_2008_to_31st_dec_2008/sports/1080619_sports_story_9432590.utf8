The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | French frailties laid bare by Italians
                                                                                                                                                                                                     French frailties laid bare by Italians
  - World Cup runners-up let down by Domenechs decisions       HENRY WINTER in ZURICH                                         Italy players jubilate after their 2-0 win over France in a group C match on Tuesday		    
	As the final whistle sounded the final post for the French, Italys huge banks of support seemed to be voicing sympathy for their devastated foe by chanting allez Les Bleus. The lyrics swiftly turned into a la maison. Brutal.         
	Just as Italy deserve to head off to a quarter final with Spain, France deserve to go home. They were badly let down by their coach, Raymond Domenech, whose decisions here at Letzigrund were riddled with insanity. In contrast, Italy merited their survival with Holland from the Group of Death because they remained more committed to attack, as briefly reported in Wednesdays Late City edition.         
	Andrea Pirlo swept in their first, a neat penalty after Eric Abidal hauled down Luca Toni and was dismissed. Daniele de Rossi, who showed all the midfield drive France lacked, set the scene for the world champions second when he drilled in a free-kick that clipped Thierry Henry on its way in.         
	So all those Italian fears of a biscotto (fix) between Holland and Romania proved unfounded. It was Domenechs tactics that really took the biscuit Tuesday night.         
	An opening half of pure horror had engulfed the French. They lost a key player, Franck Ribery, to injury. They lost Abidal to a red card as he conceded a penalty. They fell behind to Pirlos ensuing spot-kick and could have been three goals adrift by the break as Domenechs tactics shredded sound managerial practice.         
	When Thierry Henrys left foot deflected in De Rossis free-kick midway through the second period, the French nightmare intensified. Domenechs substitutions continued to confound onlookers as France bade a meek adieu to Euro 2008. Italy march on, deservedly so.         
	The mood of Donadonis men had been more determined from the start. Even during the anthems, the Italians defiant demeanour contrasted with the nervy nature of the French. And even before Abidals moment of misery, the Barcelona defender had been caught out, failing to deal with a routine through ball, losing possession to Luca Toni, who dragged his shot just wide.         
	 Italy clearly targeted Abidal, a good full-back asked by Domenech to move across because Lilian Thuram was not deemed ready for such a strenuous confrontation. Domenech could have whistled up more experienced centre-halves from the stands, where Marcel Desailly and Franck Leboeuf cast their concerned eye over proceedings.                 
	If the redeployment of Abidal appeared ill-conceived and costly, Domenechs decision to field two midfield sentries, Claude Makelele and Jeremy Toulalan, appeared over-cautious. Frances coach gambled in the wrong positions. France offered the polo formation  nothing in the middle. Domenech, in fairness, was unfortunate to be deprived of his one shining light as the darkness gathered. Challenged fairly by Gianluca Zambrotta, Ribery fell awkwardly and stayed down, clearly in pain.         
	The stricken attacker immediately signalled to the French bench that he was hors de combat, and the body-buggy soon arrived to cart poor Ribery away. As Frances No. 22 departed, Domenech sent on Samir Nasri, whose appearance was so brief it bordered on a humiliation.         
	When Toni elegantly plucked a long ball out of the air, Frances untried defence dissolved. Abidal panicked, pushing Toni from behind, sending the Bayern striker crashing to the ground.

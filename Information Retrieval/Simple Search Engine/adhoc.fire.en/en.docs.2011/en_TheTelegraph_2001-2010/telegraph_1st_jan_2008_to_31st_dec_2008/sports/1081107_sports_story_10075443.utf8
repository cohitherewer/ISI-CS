The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Giggs uses head to rescue United
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Giggs uses head to rescue United
            RODDY FORSYTH            Manchester Uniteds Ryan Giggs celebrates scoring the equaliser against Celtic at Celtic Park in Glasgow on Wednesday. (AFP)                           
	Sir Alex Fergusons porridge regained its flavour late in an absorbing contest at Parkhead in which his much-altered Manchester United came perilously close to a defeat that would have left them with a fair degree of work still to accomplish to secure progress to the last 16 of the Champions League.         
	Celtic had edged to within six minutes of inflicting a second home defeat on United in two years  Scott McDonalds accomplished first-half strike broke their duck in the tournament  but when Artur Boruc could not hold a blistering Cristiano Ronaldo shot, Ryan Giggs met the rebound with a header that salvaged a precious point.         
	Ferguson had remarked on the eve of the game that defeat here in 2006 had deprived his favourite breakfast food of its flavour  Giggss intervention guaranteed it would not stick in his throat again Thursday morning.         
	Celtic had the notional benefit of continuity, as Gordon Strachan fielded the same team that won against Hearts at Tynecastle on Saturday, but that was a virtue forced on the manager because of a calf injury suffered by Aiden McGeady that ruled the Republic of Ireland midfield player out of contention.         
	Uniteds six changes from Saturday caused some comment among the broadcast pundits, some of whom speculated that Ferguson was treating Celtic as though they were lower division opposition in the Carling Cup. Missing from the starting line-up were Edwin van der Sar, Gary Neville, Patrice Evra, Anderson, Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney.         
	In came Ben Foster, Giggs, Rafael, John Shea, Darren Fletcher and Carlos Tevez, who swiftly discovered that the evening would not follow the pattern of events at Old Trafford two weeks previously.         
	This was not a Celtic side inhibited by their hoodoo on the road in this tournament, but a tigerish outfit snarling into challenges and also capable of bounding forward with purpose when the occasion allowed. A tremendous gladiatorial tussle between Scott Brown and Tevez, shortly before half-time, characterised the intensity of Celtics approach. The Argentine pinched the ball from Browns toe, but the Celtic midfielder won possession back and went to ground under Tevezs second challenge.         
	However, he prodded the ball out for a throw-in, then had a sly kick at his opponent, who responded in kind. Tom Henning Ovrebo, the Swedish referee, did not miss the exchange but was sensibly content to urge sense on both players, an attitude that served to keep play flowing in pleasing fashion.         
	As for Celtics ability to remedy the defect that had cost them dear in Manchester  and, indeed, throughout their group campaign prior to this game  it was remedied by McDonald after 13 minutes. Celtics first corner kick, delivered by Paul Hartley from the left, was only half cleared by United and when the ball dropped beyond the box, a succession of headers - first by Brown, then Shaun Maloney and finally Gary Caldwell  shuttled it back into the path of McDonald, drifting unmarked on the left of the penalty area.         
	The Australian glanced up, saw that Foster had come off his line, and coolly lifted the ball over the advancing goalkeeper for Celtics first score in the tournament. The setback needled United into more vigorous movement in midfield  one spectacular pirouette by Ronaldo left Barry Robson bemused and stranded  but it was possession without penetration, the flaw that saw United lose at the same venue two years ago.         
	Arsenal in prospect or not, Ferguson was never likely to allow this state of affairs to continue without intervention, which took the form of sending on Berbatov for Nani at the restart.         
	The substitution almost paid instantly when United won a corner kick that was nodded by Nemanja Vidic down into the six-yard box. This had been Berbatovs killing ground in the first meeting of the sides, when he netted his two offside goals, and he came within a fraction of inflicting further damage when he got a flick that took the ball away from Boruc, but Maloney, of all people, was stationed on the line and cleared from below his own crossbar.         
	That established the pattern of the second half, with Celtic hanging on by their fingernails until Giggs delivered another of his crucial interventions.

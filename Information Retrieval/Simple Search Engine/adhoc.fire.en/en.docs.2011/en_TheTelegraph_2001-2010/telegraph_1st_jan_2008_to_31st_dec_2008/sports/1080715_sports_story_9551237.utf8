            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee seemed a satisfied man after his teams comprehensive win against Calcutta Port Trust.         
	I think it was alright, considering it was our first match of the league. The weather was heavy and the ground was muddy. It was a decent performance for us, Manoranjan said. The red-and-gold coach also defended Ashim Biswas, who missed several chances .         
	He is just back from an injury. Its true that he missed a lot of chances, but whats important is he was reaching the right positions on most occasions, Bhattacharjee said.

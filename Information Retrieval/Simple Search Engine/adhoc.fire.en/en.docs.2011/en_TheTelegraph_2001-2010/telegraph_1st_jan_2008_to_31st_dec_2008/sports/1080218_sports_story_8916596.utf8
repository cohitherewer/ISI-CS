                                                   Win comes as a big relief, says Manoranjan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: East Bengals 3-1 victory over Viva Kerala in their I-League match on Sunday came as a big relief for coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee.         
	The triumph not only helped the Calcutta giants avoid relegation but also elevated them to sixth spot. Both East Bengal and Sporting Clube de Goa have 18 points but Manoranjans side are ahead on goal difference.         
	I am relieved after earning three points here, said Manoranjan from Kozikhode. We have been under a lot of pressure since the past few weeks. The win came as a big relief.         
	The East Bengal coach said he was particularly happy because the situation was depressing when he took charge midway through the I-League.         
	We had only eight points from 11 matches when I was asked to take over. The threat of relegation was looming large. We somehow wriggled out of the difficult period.         
	Manoranjan didnt want to credit anyone in particular for avoiding relegation. Every one contributed to it. I am quite grateful to the players They followed my instructions in the right spirit.         
	When I took over I believed the team had it in them to survive. It was only a question of motivating them and hitting form. The players also realised the importance of surviving the battle. Full credit to them.         
	Syed Rahim Nabi, who opened the scoring for the Calcutta side, was adjudged the Man of the Match. Alvito DCunha also played commendably.         
	We were determined to settle things here. We rallied around each other and rose to the occasion. The coach also helped us stay focused during this time, said Nabi.         
	Much has been talked about the players revolt against Manoranjans predecessor, Subrata Bhattacharya. Nabi refused to dwell on the past, saying its time to look ahead.         
	We have just crossed a big hurdle. Its time to focus on the IFA Shield and the AFC meet now, Nabi maintained.         
	Viva Kerala, who have 12 points, have now been relegated along with Salgaocar.

	Gurgaon: New Zealands Mark Brown continued his dream run in India when he clinched a three-shot victory in the $2.5 million Johnnie Walker Classic on Sunday.         
	Brown, who played a wonderful final round of five-under 67 to notch up a glorious triumph at the DLF Golf and Country Club, also bagged his maiden international title here last week when he won the SAIL Open at the Jaypee Greens in Greater Noida.         
	I have a very good caddie and I like the climate here, nice and dry. Its really nice coming to Delhi, said a smiling Brown at the end of the day. You can be sure I am going to be back here, added Brown, who turned 33 on Saturday.         
	On Sunday, the New Zealander had an amazing run at the start of the back nine where he birdied four consecutive holes from 12th to 15th to hit the lead which he never gave up. He also birdied the final hole for an aggregate of 18-under par 270.         
	Among the Indians, Shiv Kapur (14-under) did the best to finish tied fifth. Jyoti Randhawa, a strong contender for the title till Saturday, struck a double bogey on fifth to end his campaign in the eighth position. This was his third successive top 10 finish in as many weeks.         
	While Jeev Milkha Singh finished tied 11th at 11-under 277, Arjun Atwal at nine-under 279 was tied 17th.         
	Among other Indians, Rahil Gangjee was tied 30th with seven-under, Mukesh Kumar was 44th at four-under 284, Arjun Singh was 53rd at one-under, Gaganjeet Bhullar 58th at even par, Digvijay Singh 63rd at three-over 291 and Rahul Ganapathy 64th at five-over 293.         
	Triple major winner Vijai Singh closed with 69 for nine-under-par 279 as his late charge failed to materialise. World No. 5 Adam Scott, the pre-tournament favourite, finished well back with seven-under-par 281 despite ending with a flourish with an eagle at the last.

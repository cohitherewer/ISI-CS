            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) sided with Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) and refused to blame K.P.S. Gill and company for Indias shocking defeat in the Olympic qualifiers.         
	Randhir Singh, IOA secretary, held the government responsible for the appalling state of affairs in Indian sports.         
	Addressing a stormy press conference on Friday, Randhir Singh said he was against asking the IHF officials to relinquish their office.

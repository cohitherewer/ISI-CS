The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 2011 Cup not to shift: ICC 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     2011 Cup not to shift: ICC 
                      
	New Delhi: Crickets global governing body has dismissed reports that the subcontinent could lose the 2011 World Cup due to safety fears following last weeks militant attacks in Mumbai.         
	It is media speculation, no basis for those comments, an International Cricket Council (ICC) spokesman said on Wednesday.         
	The one-day World Cup is due to be jointly hosted by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in early 2011.         
	Senior cricket officials in Pakistan, India and New Zealand had also made it clear such reports were premature, the spokesman added.         
	It is two-and-a half years before the tournament, he said from ICCs Dubai headquarters.         
	It is not an issue at this point in time and we look forward to a fantastic event.         
	Obviously safety and security is paramount and that is the case for all our members, said the ICC spokesman.         
	(But) we also recognise the fact that cricket has the ability to build bridges.         
	When India toured Pakistan in 2004 after (almost) 15 years, look at the positive impact it had.           (REUTERS)

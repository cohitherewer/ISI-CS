The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Virender Sehwag is the toughest, says Mendis
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Virender Sehwag is the toughest, says Mendis
  - Series against india was a confidence booster, says Sri Lankan spinner               Virender Sehwag and Ajantha Mendis during the recently-concluded series                           
	New Delhi: Virender Sehwags technique or the lack of it often invites criticism but Sri Lankan mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis says the swashbuckling right-hander is the only Indian batsman he found difficult to bowl to in the recently-concluded Test and ODI series.         
	There was not much of a difference in bowling to most of the Indian batsmen. Their style was similar. But Virender Sehwag was the toughest to bowl to without doubt, Mendis revealed.         
	The Lankans won the Test series 2-1 but lost the ODI series 2-3, but Mendis said he found no difference in the batting style of the two Indian sides.         
	It was more or less the same for me. My problem in one-dayers was that there were only 10 overs to bowl and it is very difficult to take wickets in that limited time, he said.         
	Mendis, however, admitted that gradually the Indians and other international teams would learn to read him and he is prepared to cope with that.         
	As time has passed since I first bowled to them, this team, which is one of the best in the world, is beginning to understand me. Other teams too must be trying to understand my bowling.         
	But I know that as long as I do the correct thing I will take wickets. If I cant then I will change my style, he said.         
	Mendis believes he has grown in confidence after the series against India during which he got prized scalps of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid.         
	I feel very happy to be bowling to the best batsmen in the world. After bowling to Tendulkar, (Sourav) Ganguly, Dravid, (V.V.S) Laxman and (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni how can I not be confident? If I can take their wickets, I can take anyones wicket in the world, he said.         
	On how he planned Tendulkars dismissal, Mendis said, I had been learning about the batting styles of the Indian batsmen for some time. I understood Tendulkars batting style and understood his weakness. Thats how I took his wicket.         
	Asked whether Dhoni was the other tough customer after Sehwag, Mendis said, I think he batted very well against me. When I put the ball in the right area he defended me.         
	But the moment I put the ball outside that area he punished me, he added.           (PTI)

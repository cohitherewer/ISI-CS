	Sydney: Australian swimmer Nick DArcy has been dropped from the team for the Beijing Olympics, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) said on Friday. DArcys place in the squad had been under scrutiny after he was charged by police on March 31 following an incident in a Sydney night club in which he was accused of punching former Commonwealth swimming champion Simon Cowley.    
	DArcy, who qualified for the Olympics in the 100 and 200 metres butterfly, withdrew from the Australian team for the World Short Course Championships in Manchester and was not invited to a training camp in Canberra this weekend.        
	Tokyo: The survival of Formula One strugglers Super Aguri looks likely to rest on the goodwill of backers Honda after the collapse of a planned rescue deal. Potential buyers Magma Group pulled the plug on their take over bid earlier this week and the cash-strapped Japanese team are now in danger of missing next weeks Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona.    
	Its possible, Super Aguri co-owner Fumio Akita said on Friday. We were banking on Magmas buyout but they turned it down. It feels like being jilted by a lover. Even if we have the money to go to Spain we might not be able to carry on after that. Its impossible to predict what will happen but it could now depend on Honda.

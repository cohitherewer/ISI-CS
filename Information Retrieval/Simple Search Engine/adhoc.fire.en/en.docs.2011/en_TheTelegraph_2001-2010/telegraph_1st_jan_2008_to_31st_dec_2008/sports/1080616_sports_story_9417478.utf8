	London: Kevin Pietersens inventive 110 not out, which included two unorthodox left-handed sixes, helped steer England to a 114-run win over New Zealand in the first ODI in Durham on Sunday.         
	England took the lead in the five-match series after the Kiwis, replying to Englands 307 for five, failed to threaten their target and were all out for 193. Brendon McCullum top-scored with 36 while Paul Collingwood took four for 15.         
	New Zealand were unable to halt their losing streak after they were beaten 2-0 in the Test series and went down by nine wickets in Fridays Twenty20 international.         
	New Zealands task was made all the more difficult after a fourth-wicket partnership of 136 between Pietersen and skipper Collingwood, who struck a run-a-ball 64. Owais Shah added a skilful 49 from just 25 balls, including three sixes.         
	Englands top-ranked batsman Pietersen faced 112 balls and struck eight fours and three sixes in compiling his sixth one-day International century and first since the World Cup last April.         
	The sixes he struck off mediumpacer Scott Styris created the greatest talking point.           (REUTERS)

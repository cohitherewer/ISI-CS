The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alonso refuels desire to win
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Alonso refuels desire to win
            Kevin Garside            Fernando Alonso                           
	A straw poll in the Hockenheim paddock delivered a forgotten conclusion: that Fernando Alonso is the best driver in Formula One. Memories were jogged, perhaps, by his scintillating lap in qualifying in a car struggling to hang on to its status as a constituent of Formula Ones second tier.         
	Of those canvassed, Alonsos was the name that rang out above the claims of F1 supernova Lewis Hamilton and world champion Kimi Raikkonen. We should point out that the midfield does not bear the same scrutiny as the leading pack. Mistakes are buried in anonymity. Put a wheel off line when chasing victory and the wrath of experts explodes like a cluster bomb.               
	That point at which his car stood still after the lollypop had gone up to signal the start of his final qualifying run is frozen in F1 lore. Behind him sat a simmering Hamilton, denied a last flying lap by Alonsos brake as a punishment for bolting the pits out of sequence at the start of that final qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix.         
	The ensuing press conference with Alonso and Hamilton sat in the centre of the McLaren palazzo, the Spaniard wringing the neck of a pear, his team-mate a coiled spring of defiance, was molten with tension. Emotional lava spewed, laying waste to Alonsos relationship with the team.         
	Questions about his McLaren experience are not permitted by Renault. One suspects he would not mind being behind the wheel of a McLaren next weekend instead of delivering shopping to all points of the Hungaroring in his Renault-sponsored Tesco van. The book, when it comes, will doubtless reveal all.         
	Chief among the proclaimers are Honda, who are engaged in a low-voltage campaign to persuade Alonso that they and not Ferrari are better placed to fulfil his ambitions in the immediate future. And those ambitions are growing with every uncontested grand prix.         
	Absence from the podium has rekindled Alonsos desire, forced a reversal in his thinking. Three world titles would see him out the F1 door, he once said. Not any more. Alonso wants a crack at the Schumacher legend.         
	I still love this sport. There are ups and downs. The good moments are hard to forget. I cant get those feelings from anything else in life.         
	It is true that two or three years ago I was thinking I would not stay that long in F1 like Michael did. I started at 19 with Minardi. Back then I was thinking that 19 or 20 years in F1 would be too many. F1 can sap your energy so I was thinking I did not want to lose my life to F1.         
	Now my opinion has changed. Im 26 and thinking, why not another ten or 11 years?         
	 I want more success and Im ready to spend the time needed to get that success back.         
	Alonso admits to frustration pitching up at events that cannot be won. He has come too far, achieved too much, to be engaged in a project without yield. The next decision must be right. Renault was always a safe haven, a homecoming of sorts after the collapse of his marriage to McLaren.

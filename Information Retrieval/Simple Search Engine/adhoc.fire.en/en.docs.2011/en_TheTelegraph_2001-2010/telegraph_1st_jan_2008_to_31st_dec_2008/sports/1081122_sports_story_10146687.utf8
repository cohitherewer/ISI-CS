                  Jyoti Randhawa                     
	Shenzhen: Struggling to find form ahead of next weeks Omega Mission Hills Golf World Cup, Jyoti Randhawa says he would just focus on making pars and leave the rest on teammate Jeev Milkha Singhs winning touch when the duo take the course for India at the mega-event.         
	I just need to keep making pars and hell do the rest, Randhawa said of his first-time partner in the event starting November 27.         
	Its a good team and we hope to do well. It is different playing in the World Cup as there is more pressure as youre playing for the country and there is a lot riding on it. Its a great event and Im looking forward to it, he added.         
	The Delhi-pro, who has struggled this season with poor form and fitness, is good friends with Jeev as they grew up playing professional golf during the 1990s, which Randhawa believes will carry the team to a good showing in Mission Hills.         
	Were comfortable being around each other, we are regularly having meals together on Tour. Hes a funny guy as well and I hope we dont take it onto the golf course! We will certainly focus on our game and Im looking forward to partnering him, he said.         
	While Randhawa featured in the team that ended ninth in 2005 for Indias best ever finish, Jeev will be making his long-awaited debut and is excited at the opportunity to fly his countrys flag in China.         
	We are very excited, we are very strong as a team, said Jeev, the Asian Tours number one in 2006 and virtually assured of this seasons Order of Merit title after securing victory at last weeks Barclays Singapore Open.

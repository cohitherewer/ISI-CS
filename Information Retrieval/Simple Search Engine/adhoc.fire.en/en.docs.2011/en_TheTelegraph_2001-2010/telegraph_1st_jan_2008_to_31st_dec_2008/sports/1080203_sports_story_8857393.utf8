	Hobart/Colombo: A fresh controversy broke out in Australia after unruly fans threw eggs on Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharans face in Hobart on Friday night. 
    
	Eggs were thrown at Muralidharan and those struck him, a top Sri Lankan Cricket (SLC) official said in Colombo adding that the authorities were looking into the incident. 
    
	The incident, which marks a new low in Aussie fans turbulent relations with Muralidharan, has prompted cricket authorities in Sri Lanka to ask for heightened security for the players. 
    
	We have drawn the attention of Cricket Australia to this incident. They have already given the team security. But we have asked the authorities whether this can be beefed up further, SLC secretary K. Mathivanan said. 
    
	A newspaper reported that the Sri Lankan cricketers were jeered and attacked by some local residents in Hobart when they were returning to their hotel after dinner. 
    
	The Sri Lankan team management then safely guided the players back to their hotel and the police arrived at the scene, the newspaper said. 
    
	Muralidharan, who holds the world record with 723 Test wickets, has had a history of hostility with the Australian spectators, who have jeered him on previous tours, forcing him to stop going Down Under for some time. 
    
	The off-spinner was no-balled by Aussie umpires and the bowler had to undergo laboratory tests to prove the legality of his bowling action. 
    
	Former SLC chief Thilanga Sumathipala lambasted the ICC and said with an Australian (Malcolm Speed) as its chief executive, the governing body had turned a blind eye even though Asian players continue to be harassed Down Under. 
    
	We have to see the bigger picture. For some reasons, you always have an Australian as the CEO there. Every time an Asian player is treated like this, there is no step from the ICC. We need to get rid of that and only then we can move forward, said a furious Sumathipala. 
    
	He, however, hoped that the incident would leave the Sri Lankan team a close-knit unit. 
    
	As of now, Arjuna (Ranatunga) is heading the board and it should be dealt at the board-to-board level. I just hope the players stand together, get stronger and be united. And I think they would do well after this incident, he said. 
    
	This is a fresh jolt for Australias already tattered image, with its team coming under attack for their unsporting behaviour and a racism row that marred their just-concluded Test series against India.

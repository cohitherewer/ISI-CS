                                                   Sehwag: If they sledge, we wont keep quiet

           
	Canberra: Opener Virender Sehwag reckons that his blistering 78-ball 113 in the drawn warm-up tie against ACT XI would be enough to earn him a third Test berth. 
    
	Hopefully, I have won back my place. It doesnt matter if I bat as an opener or in the middle order, I just want to be back, a relaxed Sehwag said. 
    
	The right-hander played a swashbuckling knock of 113 off 78 balls with 18 fours and two sixes and promises to carry on the good work in Perth which has the reputation of a fiery track. 
    
	Perth may have a reputation to help fast bowlers but it is also good for batsmen. You can play your shots and I had got some runs in the two one-day Internationals there, he said. 
    
	Asked to comment on sledging issue, Sehwag said: If the Australians do it, then we wont keep quiet. 
    
	The opener also made the point that Harbhajan was innocent and that Andrew Symonds had, in a TV interview, admitted that he had started the row (in Sydney). 
    
	The Delhi batsman, the only triple centurion in Indian cricket annals, is determined to carry the attack to the Australians. 
    
	I would like to attack (the Australian fast bowlers), go there with a positive mindset and play my shots. 
    
	In many ways, his century against the ACT XI could play a vital role in Sehwags revival as the right-hander admitted he approached the innings with a different mindset. 
    
	I tried to be positive in the middle. In the first innings I was trying to leave the ball but on Saturday I decided to stick to my game, he added. 
    
	In the recent past, I had a negative mindset. I wanted to spend time in the middle, not playing too many shots. Today I decided to play as I normally do, Sehwag said. 
    
	I didnt worry about spending time in the middle, the wicket was slow, the ball wasnt coming on to the bat and I decided to play like I used to in the past, he said. 
    
	Sehwag admitted the past few months have been a real test on his nerves when he lost his berth. 
    
	Yes, it was disappointing sitting out. Both Yuvraj and (Wasim) Jaffer were playing well and it was really challenging sitting out. 
    
	But I am happy that there is competition in the team and now I am waiting for my chance, he said 
    
	The stocky right-hander is happy to be making a comeback in Tests rather than a one-dayer. 
    
	I am happy playing Test rather than ODIs. In Tests, you have plenty of time to spend to get your form back. In one-dayers, you are worrying about overs, fielding restrictions and other th- ings. 
    
	I always had self-belief that I can do well in australia. The last tour was good for me. (Anil) Kumble had also backed me. I thank him and the selectors for posing faith in me and picking me for the tour, Sehwag said. 
    
	Sehwag, who was not part of the team in the Sydney Test, said thought of defeat never crossed the Indians mind. 
    
	We never thought we will lose the match even when wickets fell in quick succession. We knew Kumble and Harbjahan can bat down the order. 
    
	We were sure that RP (Singh) and Ishant (Sharma) can also bat a few overs if needed, but it just did not happen. The team was angry that we could have at least drawn the Test but lost due to some bad decisions against us, he said. 
    
	It is bad for cricket that Sydney Test will be remembered for all controversies despite some good performances like that of Hayden, Kumble and Harbhajan, he said.

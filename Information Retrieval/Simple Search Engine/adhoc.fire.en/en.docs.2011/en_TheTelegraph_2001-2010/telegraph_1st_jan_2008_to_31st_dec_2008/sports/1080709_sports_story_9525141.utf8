                                                      Chappell lashes out at ICC   Melbourne: Former Australian skipper Ian Chappell has lashed out at the ICC for adding yet another ldquo;ignominious rdquo; chapter in its ldquo;chequered history rdquo; by allowing Zimbabwe to stay on board and bending rules to placate Pakistan.  In a bitter outburst, Chappell said the Zimbabwe issue has become a ldquo;raging bushfire rdquo; because of the ICC rsquo;s inaction and the same holds true for the Oval Test, the result of which was changed from a forfeit win for England to a draw in the ICC executive meeting last week.  Zimbabwe was allowed to keep its full membership on the ICC board in lieu of opting out of the Twenty20 World Championship in England.  The decision means that the strife-torn Zimbabwe board will continue to get the ICC rsquo;s financial aid despite audit reports giving damning evidence of bunglings in Zimbabwe cricket rsquo;s accounts.

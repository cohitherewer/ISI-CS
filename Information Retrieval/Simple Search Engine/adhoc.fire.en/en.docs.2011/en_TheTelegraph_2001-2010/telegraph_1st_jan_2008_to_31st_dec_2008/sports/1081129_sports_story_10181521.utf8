The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chepauk it is, not the Eden
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chepauk it is, not the Eden
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Friday chose Chennai as the venue for the second Test, promptly responding to England and Wales Cricket Boards (ECB) request to shift the match from terror-hit Mumbai.         
	England will return home from Bangalore after abandoning the Guwahati and New Delhi one-dayers in the wake of the Mumbai terror strikes.         
	The change in the venue for the second Test was communicated to the media via a release.         
	Indias Test series against England will be played as per schedule. Chennai will host the second Test from December 19 to 23, instead of Mumbai, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan said.         
	The first Test will be played in Ahmedabad from December 11 to 15 as originally scheduled. Baroda will host the three-day game between the visitors and the Board Presidents XI from December 5 to 7 as scheduled, the release added.         
	Strangely, Chennai will be hosting its second Test within eight months when Calcutta has not hosted a Test for almost a year.         
	In fact, even Bangalore has hosted two Tests in the past year and Ahmedabad ( which became a test centre not more than 25 years ago) will be hosting its second Test in seven months.         
	The BCCI is supposed to be following a rotation policy in allotting Test matches to the different venues, but this discrimination makes no sense at all.         
	CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya said he didnt want to comment till he had gone through the rotation roster.         
	He also couldnt confirm whether the previous regime, headed by Prasun Mukherjee, had declined to host a Test after the Indian Premier League on the grounds that the Eden would be renovated.         
	However, it would also have been prudent for the BCCI to have sought the CABs views in the circumstances, especially since there has been a change of guard at its helm.

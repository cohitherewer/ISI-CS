The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pawar thanks ICC 
                                                Pawar thanks ICC 
                      
	New Delhi: BCCI president Sharad Pawar on Tuesday thanked the ICC for removing Steve Bucknor from the third Test. He was also happy that Harbhajan Singh was now free to play in Perth against Australia.         
	We had appealed to the ICC to review the performance of the umpires in the last two matches and take appropriate action. Im grateful that the ICC has taken this decision and removed him. The Indian board is quite happy about that, Pawar told reporters.         
	Let me make it clear that it is the prerogative of the ICC whether a or b should be appointed or should continue or discontinue as an umpire. So it is solely an ICC decision.         
	Meanwhile, former India captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi also welcomed the decision. ICC has done a pretty good job. I dont think Bucknor will ever get an opportunity to stand in Tests. There is a process and he will be demoted, Pataudi said.           (PTI)

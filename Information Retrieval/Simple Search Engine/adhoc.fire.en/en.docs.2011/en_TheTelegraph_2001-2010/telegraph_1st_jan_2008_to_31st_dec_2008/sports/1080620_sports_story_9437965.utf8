	Marriage my goal: Domenech  
	Paris: Frances football coach is facing calls to quit after proposing to his girlfriend on television minutes after his teams exit from the European championships.  
	Instead of offering a heartfelt Mea Culpa for what the French press dubbed a shipwreck after his side were beaten 2-0 by Italy, Raymond Domenech launched into a tortured declaration of love for Estelle Denis.         
	I have only one project: to marry Estelle, which is what Im asking her today. I know its difficult, but its at moments like this that you need everyone and I need her, he said with tears in his eyes. Le Parisien described the outburst as unreal, while LEquipe, the sports daily, was furious at his error of taste.         
	Ribery surgery         
	Basel: France winger Franck Ribery will have an operation Thursday in Munich to repair a tear in the ligament of his left ankle and will be out of action for up to eight weeks, his club Bayern Munich said. Ribery fell awkwardly in Frances 0-2 loss to Italy on Tuesday that eliminated the French from the European Championship. He was examined Wednesday at the hotel of the German team in Basel by team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt, who is also Bayerns medical chief. Germany is playing Portugal in the quarterfinals Thursday.         
	Kovac to retire         
	Bad Tatzmannsdorf: Croatia captain Niko Kovac will end his international career after the European Championship, where he expects his country to go beyond the quarter finals. The match against Turkey on Friday is the peak of my career, the 36-year-old midfielder said Thursday. It could be my last for Croatia, but lets hope it isnt as I have a feeling we can do much more here than just the quarter finals. The German-born Kovac has made 78 appearances for his country, scoring 13 goals.         
	Ronaldo suit         
	London: Cristiano Ronaldo won libel damages Thursday from a British tabloid over claims he was fined by Manchester United for using a cell phone during a training session. Attorney Simon Smith told Londons High Court that tabloids report suggested wholly unprofessional and arrogant behaviour by the Portugal winger in using his phone four times on Uniteds training pitches in a single day. Ronaldo accepted undisclosed damages from the tabloid, which falsely said he had been ordered to pay a fine of 8,000. I felt it necessary to bring this action in order to protect my reputation as a professional footballer, said Ronaldo, who has donated his payout to a charity in Portugal.         
	Dutch tragedy         
	Lausanne: The Netherlands defender Khalid Boulahrouz has lost his prematurely born daughter Anissa, leaving the family and his teammates distraught, the team said Thursday.         
	Players and staff of the Dutch team are upset by the death of Anissa, the daughter of Khalid Boulahrouz and his wife Sabia, who was born prematurely, the Dutch soccer federation said in a statement. The defender was taken away from training Wednesday after his wife was hospitalised with pregnancy complications. She had followed the championships with the other players partners and girlfriends.

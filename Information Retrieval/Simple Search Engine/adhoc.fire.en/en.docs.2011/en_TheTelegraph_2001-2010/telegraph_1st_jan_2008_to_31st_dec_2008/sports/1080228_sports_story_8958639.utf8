The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brett Lee calls for voice of reason
                                                   Brett Lee calls for voice of reason
                      
	Melbourne: Disappointed at the continuing bad blood between Australian and Indian cricketers, speedster Brett Lee on Wednesday said the teams should put the controversies behind and concentrate on cricket.         
	Its a bit of a shame that a few things have happened on the cricket field People know where the line in the sand is and if you cross that line well you know you will get dealt with, Lee said after winning the Allan Border Medal for the best Australian player of 2007.         
	The thing we have to acknowledge too is that once you do walk on to the cricket field and go over that line it doesnt matter who made friendships, its very important we go out there and play the hardest, toughest, fairest cricket we possibly can, he said.         
	After Indias young paceman Ishant Sharma was fined following a war of words with Andrew Symonds in the last encounter, the Indians made an official complaint about the provocative behaviour.         
	In another incident, Australian opener Matthew Hayden called Harbhajan Singh an obnoxious weed on radio.         
	Lee, who has an increased work load after the retirement of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, said the initial relaxed phase of his career had made him more determined for success.         
	It made me very hungry and it made me appreciate the chance to wear the Baggy Green once it was taken away, and to never become complacent, he said.         
	To appreciate the good times youve got to go through the bad I think. Everyones been through it, people have had time on the sidelines, he said. (PTI)

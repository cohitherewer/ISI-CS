The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CA plans to open IPL window
                                                   CA plans to open IPL window
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia (CA) is planning to open the Indian Premier League window by forcing Test and one-day cricket to take a back seat on the international calendar.         
	According to a report published in the Sydney Morning Herald, it has been revealed that Australia are willing to renegotiate tours already scheduled over the next four years to fit around the Twenty20 tournament.         
	While CA remains embroiled in a dispute with the IPLs lawyers over players contractual obligations, it gave its strongest indication yet on Wednesday that it will bow to Indian pressure, with chief executive James Sutherland open to the idea of shifting matches on the International Cricket Councils Future Tours Program, which has been outlined until 2012.         
	The Federation of International Cricketers Association has also pushed for an annual window to allow international stars to compete in the competition.         
	Also sending a strong signal to CA, the IPLs agent Neil Maxwell has warned that players may take premature retirement or simply walk away if they are not allowed to take part in the meet.         
	Maxwell, who manages Brett Lee and Mike Hussey, said if the conflicting issues were not resolved, the lure of money might persuade players to opt for the IPL instead of their national teams, the Courier Mail reported.         
	The cricket world is going to have to respond to the IPL, given the magnitude of it, Maxwell said. IPL chairman Lalit Modi has already said that global protection for CAs sponsors would not be given and has set a Sunday deadline for the players to sign the contracts.         
	Sutherlands stance on the FTP indicates that CA sees its players taking part in the IPL over the coming years, although a spokesman for the organisation would not rule out penalties for players who signed contracts without permission.

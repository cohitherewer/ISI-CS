The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A first for Jared Tallent
                                                                                                                                                                                           A first for Jared Tallent
            Beijing 2008                
	 Australian Jared Tallent won the first athletics event at Chinas new Birds Nest National Stadium on Friday when he claimed victory in the IAAF 20km race walk.         
	The 23-year-old Commonwealth bronze medallist received a huge roar from the 3,000 spectators rattling around in the 91,000-seater showpiece venue for this years Beijing Olympics when he crossed the line after one hour, 20 minutes and 11 seconds.         
	Fantastic, Tallent told reporters. Its very special to be the first winner in the Birds Nest, I couldnt be happier. This is my first big international win and Im hoping to do it again in August.                 
	New coach for Idowu  
	British world indoor triple jump champion Phillips Idowu has taken the unusual step of changing coaches just months before the Games.   
	 I am at the point where I want to try new things as I dedicate everything to winning Olympic gold in Beijing, Idowu said.         
	Idowu, who has worked with John Herbert for the past 10 years, will now be coached by Aston Moore, UK Athletics senior performance manager for field events.                 
	Marathon trials  
	Olympic bronze medallist Deena Kastor is the odds-on favourite to win the US womens marathon trials on Sunday in Boston. Among those running will be 50-year-old Joan Benoit Samuelson, the winner of the first Olympic womens marathon in 1984.

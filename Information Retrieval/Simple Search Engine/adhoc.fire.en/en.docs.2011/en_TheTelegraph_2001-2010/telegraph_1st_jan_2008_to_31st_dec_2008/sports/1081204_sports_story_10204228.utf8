The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke: Wont let terrorists dictate
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Clarke: Wont let terrorists dictate
                      
	London: England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Giles Clarke has indicated that Kevin Pietersen and his men will be back in India for next weeks Test series, insisting he would not let terrorists dictate cricket.         
	Under no circumstances will we allow our cricket to be dictated to by terrorists. India is an enormous country and there are large parts of it that have never seen terrorist activity. In 2005 the Aussies were sensible and we are doing the same here, Clarke was quoted as saying by the Press Association.         
	Traumatised by the mayhem in Mumbai, top players like Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison are unwilling to return to India after abandoning the last two one-dayers last month.         
	The EBC has sent security expert Reg Dickason to take stock of the arrangements for the two-match Test series to be held in Chennai and Mohali. Dickason has okayed Chennai and will soon visit Mohali before submitting a report to ECB.         
	Clarke said he was happy with the BCCIs efforts at tightening the security.         
	A lot of progress has been made and some extremely good and constructive meetings have taken place, Clarke said.           (PTI)

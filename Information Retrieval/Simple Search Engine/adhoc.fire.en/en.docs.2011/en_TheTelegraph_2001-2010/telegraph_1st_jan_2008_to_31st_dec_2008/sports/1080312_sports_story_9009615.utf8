                                                     Federer keeps his cool to scald Sampras 
  - Losses motivate me more than anything, says Swiss world No. 1             Roger Federer and Pete Sampras after their exhibition match at New Yorks Madison Square Garden on Monday. Federer won 6-3, 6-7, 7-6. (Reuters)                           
	New York: World No. 1 Roger Federer overcame a stiff challenge from Pete Sampras in an dynamic exhibition match between two of the greatest male tennis players of all time.         
	The 26-year-old Swiss was tested hard by his 36-year-old American foe before prevailing 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (8-6) before a crowd of 19,000 at Madison Square Garden, including world No. 1 golfer Tiger Woods, Federers friend.         
	I thought I had him there for a split second, Sampras said. Thats why hes the greatest player.         
	Sampras, who retired from competitive tennis in September 2002 after winning his 14th Grand Slam title at the US Open, ran into trouble early, dropping his serve in the opening game on Monday.         
	Federer displayed brilliant court stewardship. He broke Sampras more time in the ninth game to run away with the first set in 29 minutes.         
	In the second set, Sampras levelled with some solid serving.         
	Federer grabbed the momentum. The seven-time Wimbledon champion fell 0-2 in the ensuing set but staged a remarkable comeback, reeling off five-straight games to go up 5-2 and 30-all. But Federer regrouped and snatched the victory in the tie-breaker when a Sampras backhand sailed wide.         
	Federer edged Sampras twice in a three-city Asian exhibition tour last November with the American veteran coming on top in their last meeting in Macau.         
	Federer had earlier dismissed suggestions that his career was in decline and said he would use recent defeats as motivation after recovering from a virus.         
	The Swiss player lost in the first round in Dubai last week by Briton Andy Murray, his first match since defeat by eventual champion Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open semi-finals in January.         
	In Switzerland there is a little too much speculation my career is over, Federer told a news conference before the match against Sampras.         
	People just need to know Im healthy and happy and not miserable and down and out.         
	Federer competes at the Pacific Life Open at Indian Wells later this week. He was told he was suffering from glandular fever after the Australian Open.         
	Honestly, losses motivate me more than anything, said Federer. Trying to come back, trying to prove Im still the one to beat. I just want to show I can do it over and over again.         
	The back-to-back defeats dented Federers aura of invincibility and fed the confidence of those younger rivals who have seen him reign as No. 1 for a record 215 consecutive weeks.         
	Within two Grand Slam titles of Samprass record, Federer said his affection for tennis was greater than ever.         
	I love competing on centre courts all over the world. So many people are happy when I get there. It touches me. I love to practice more and more now, he said.         
	What I enjoy most are the matches, the pressure, the fans, centre court. I hope thats going to stay with me as long as possible.         
	Federer may have made his worst start to a season in eight years but Sampras was confident the Swiss would soon be winning again.         
	In a lot of ways Roger has created this sort of monster of being unbeatable, he said. If you lose a match here, lose a match there, people have the assumption he has lost his edge, lost his dominance. I dont look at it like that at all.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib hearing adjourned
                                                                                                                                                                                                     CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	 Shoaib hearing adjourned  
	Karachi: The Lahore high court on Tuesday adjourned till Friday the hearing into Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtars petition seeking a stay on the 18-month ban imposed on him.  
	The beleaguered bowler was originally banned for five years by the Pakistan Cricket Boards (PCBs) disciplinary committee.         
	The ban was later reduced to 18 months by an appellate tribunal, which also fined him Rs 7 million.         
	Describing the reduced ban as illegal and unjustified, Akhtar appealed against it in the Lahore high court on Monday.         
	Traicos advice         
	 Dubai: Urging the International Cricket Council (ICC) to keep cricket and politics separate, former Zimbabwe player John Traicos has asked the governing body to ignore the aggressive push for the African Nations expulsion being spearheaded by England and South Africa.         
	If the principal reason for the moves towards banning Zimbabwe cricket is the political situation in the country, then I do not believe that a ban is justified, Traicos wrote in a website.         
	Cricket and politics should be kept separate as far as possible, unless politics interferes to such an extent that the cricketing body is not a good ICC cricket citizen.         
	Traicos said if the cricket boards of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, where there is political interference in the running of the game, can be allowed to remain on board, there was nothing wrong in backing Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC).         
	PCB refusal         
	 Karachi: Pakistani Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday refused permission to pacer Sohail Tanvir to play for Hampshire for a short stint in the English County Championship.         
	I asked the board for clearance but they said it would be better if I remains with the national team and prepare for the upcoming commitments of the national team including the Champions Trophy, said Tanvir, who had been offered the contract through Shane Warne.         
	Tanvir has been one of the Pakistans fastest improving players taking five wickets in Pakistans last Asia Cup tie against Sri Lanka. He also finished as the highest wicket-taker in the Indian Premier League for the Rajasthan Royals captained by Warne.         
	The offer came because of Warne who felt a stint with Hampshire would help me polish my skills, he added.         
	The PCB has imposed a restriction on allowing its pace bowlers to play in the County Championship because of the growing fitness.         
	It had also stopped Rao Iftikhar, Mohammed Asif and Umar Gul from signing contracts with other counties.         
	T20 tourney         
	 Chandigarh: Deaf cricketers from India and Pakistan will play three Twenty20 matches for the Dosti Cup tournament, kicking off on Wednesday with first clash at Amritsar.         
	The second match will be played on Friday at Jalandhar and the final at Ludhiana on Sunday.

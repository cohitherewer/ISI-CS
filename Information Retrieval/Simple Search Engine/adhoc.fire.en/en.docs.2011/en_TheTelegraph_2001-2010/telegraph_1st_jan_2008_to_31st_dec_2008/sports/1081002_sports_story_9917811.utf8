The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Badrinath ready to bat at any position
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Badrinath ready to bat at any position
                      
	Hyderabad: Right on the cusp of realising his Test cricket dreams, promising batsman S. Badrinath says he is ready to bat anywhere in the batting order and would also show his fielding skills against Australia.         
	Any position, any number, Badrinath said, when asked what would be his preferred position if he gets picked in the playing XI. It has been a dream for me and if I make my Test debut against Australia, worlds number one team, it just could not get better, a beaming Badrinath said after the net session here on the eve of Board President XIs warm-up match against Australia.         
	Badrinath said the practice match would help him get a fair idea about the Australian side.         
	The match now becomes even more important for me, because it allows me to play against the same Australian players whom I might face again in the Test series, he said.         
	Assessing the Aussies, Badrinath said it would be a challenge to face the Australian attack. They have a great pace bowling attack but I think the spin department is a little weak and inexperienced, he observed.         
	Runs have flowed from Badrinaths blade in domestic cricket and the 28-year-old, three-ODI veteran is also one of the most athletic fielders around.         
	I enjoy fielding and I hope to contribute to the teams cause with both my batting and fielding, said the Tamil Nadu batsman.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib needs care: Younis
                                                                                                                                                                                           Shoaib needs care: Younis
                      
	Karachi: Projected as a spoilt brat by the media, Shoaib Akhtar is actually a child in a mans body, says senior Pakistan batsman Younis Khan. He feels the maverick pacer is in desperate need of some privacy to get his career back on track.         
	Shoaib is a match winner and I have spent a lot of time with him ... He is like a kid who needs attention all the time... He is in need of extra care, Younis said.         
	Shoaib is battling to save his chequered career after being handed a five-year ban by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for disciplinary violations.         
	Fast bowlers are shouqeen (fun loving) and passionate people... More passionate than the normal players. But it would be better if the media gave them some room and they should not be given the coverage they get ... They need to be supported and encouraged, Younis observed.

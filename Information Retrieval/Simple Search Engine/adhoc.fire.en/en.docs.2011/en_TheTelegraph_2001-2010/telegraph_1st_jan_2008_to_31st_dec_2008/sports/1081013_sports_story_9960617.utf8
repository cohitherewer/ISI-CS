                                                                                                                                                                                                       Liang clinches Indian Open
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Liang Wen-Chong at the Delhi Golf Club on Sunday                           
	New Delhi: Chinas Liang Wen-Chong came up with a sensational performance in the last two holes to win the $1m Hero Honda Indian Open at the Delhi Golf Club (DGC) on Sunday.         
	Hotly chased by Australias Darren Beck on the final day, Liang produced nerve-wrecking birdies to sign off at 16-under 272, just a shot ahead of Beck, who clinched the second place at 15-under 273.         
	Australias Adam Blyth finished third with a final score of 13 under 275.         
	Indias Jeev Milkha Singh, who defied medical advice to come out on the final day, dished out an excellent show to end his round at three-under 69 for an overall 12-under 276 but it could only earn him the fourth place.         
	Nevertheless, I am pretty pleased with my performance here, said Jeev later. I had a sprained right neck that was hurting since last night. First I thought of pulling out but then decided against it. I had my neck taped by the physio and then only I could play.         
	Yet, the Chandigarh pro came up with his best-ever performance in the Indian Open. He started by hitting back to back birdies on the first and the second and was three-under at the turn after picking up another birdie-brace against a fifth hole bogey.         
	Defending champion Jyoti Randhawa continued to have a poor run for the fourth consecutive day turning in a 74 that left him tied 57th with an overall two-over total. Among the other Indians, Mukesh Kumar (70) and Ashok Kumar (72) were tied sixth with a total of six-under. Sanjay Kumar recorded a creditable tied 10th finish after returning a 70 that put his final tally at seven-under.         
	India-born Swedish star Daniel Chopra had a miserable outing and could finish only 49th. He posted his worst card of the tournament  79  on the final day with a total of one-over.         
	Coming back to Liang, the Chinese, who led for the past three days, surrendered the lead for sometime on the final day when he double bogeyed on the 15th hole.         
	With Beck threatening to pip him to the post, Liang played superb golf in the final two holes to bag the title much to the delight of the huge crowd that gathered around the course. I selected a wrong club for the 15th that created the problem, he said.         
	This is a very important win for me. This is my second Asian Tour title and it proved that my skills are improving, Liang added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina is now in   top 10
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Saina is now in   top 10
                            
	New Delhi: High on confidence after breaking into the top-10 of the badminton rankings, ace Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal has already set her eyes on making the top-five by the end of next year.         
	The Hyderabad ace said she is in no mood to stop and will do whatever it takes to grab a place in the top-five.         
	My next target is to break into the top five next year. I know it wont be easy because from here on I will have to play the quarters and semis, if not the finals, in all the tournaments against top players. But I know I can do it, Saina said.         
	The Beijing Olympics quarter finalist, who officially gained the 10th spot Thursday, said she was pretty confident of securing the 10th spot.         
	I knew it when I was playing in the Hong Kong Open. I knew if I could make the quarter finals then I will break into the top-10. The girl who was 10th had already lost the match, so I had an idea, the 18-year-old shuttler said.         
	But after it was officially announced, my father called up to give me the news and Gopi sir (national coach Pulella Gopichand) congratulated me next. However, the national champion says she will have to wait for the celebrations.         
	Today I am going to Vijaywada, from there, I will go to Kochi, and then on Sunday I will be back in Hyderabad and hopefully if everything goes well we might have dinner at the academy.

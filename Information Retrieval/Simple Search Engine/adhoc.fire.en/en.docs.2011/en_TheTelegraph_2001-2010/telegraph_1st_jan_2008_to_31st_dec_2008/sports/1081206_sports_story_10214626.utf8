  Awaiting the legend with bated breath

	Calcutta: A few hours before Diego Maradona alights from a helicopter to lay the foundation stone of the sports complex at Maheshtala, the local municipality was praying that the hour-long function would help them acquire a partner to build the stadium.         
	We are trying to build one of the biggest sports complex in the state, said Kali Bhandari, chairman of the Maheshtala municipality. Naturally, we do not have so much money. With Maradonas arrival on Friday, we should be able find a sponsor in the next few months.         
	Knowing that it is almost a god sent opportunity to get the prince of football to inaugurate the sports complex on the outskirts of Calcutta, the local authorities are working overtime to make the occasion a hit.         
	A total of 22 acres has been earmarked for the sports complex to be named after Maradona. Work is yet to begin on the project and even the foundation laying ceremony would be done on the stage for security reasons.         
	The securitymen are not ready to allow Maradona to come down from the stage and walk down to the ground to inaugurate the academy, an official said. We have decided to get it done on the stage itself.         
	The chairman of the municipality hoped that the sports complex would soon emerge as one of the biggest in the state. Our plan is to build a 20,000 capacity stadium and an indoor stadium next to it, he said. The indoor stadium would be completed in the next two years. Now the time is to raise enough money to build the stadium.         
	Bhandari said that the local municipality had got nothing to do with the Indian Football School (IFS), which will be housed in the stadium.         
	The IFS is a separate body. It is trying to build a residential sports academy, the official said.         
	The security agencies are not taking any risk and have told the local organisers that no one, except a chosen few, would be allowed to come anywhere near the stage. The Argentine will arrive in Batanagar in a helicopter and then drive down the last couple of kilometers to attend his first public function of the two-day visit.         
	The distance between the first row of dignitaries and Maradona should be at least 45 feet, police have told the organisers. Only a few hundred invitation cards have been issued. The rest would be stopped at least 200 metres away from the function.

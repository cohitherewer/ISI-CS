The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Milkha at tied 47th
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev Milkha at tied 47th

	Houston: Jeev Milkha Singh emerged unscathed from a rollercoaster back nine to card two-under 70 and make the halfway cut in the Houston Open here.         
	After a poor opening round of 73, Jeev needed a solid round to hang around for weekend action and the Indian managed a card decent enough to place him at tied 47th.         
	The sedate front nine  with birdies on the first and eighth holes and the bogey on the fifth  did not provide any inkling about his eventful back nine.         
	It was an intriguing nine-hole stretch where Jeev soared and slumped and dealt only in birdies or bogeys.         
	He picked up a shot on the 10th only to bogey the next before reeling off four birdies in a row to be five-under for the day, with just three holes to go. But what followed was a hattrick of bogeys that halted him in his stride, stretching his two-day total to one-under 143.         
	Overnight leader Johnson Wagner (132) carded 69 to retain the pole position with a three-shot lead over Mathew Goggin (64) and Charley Hoffman (70). (PTI)

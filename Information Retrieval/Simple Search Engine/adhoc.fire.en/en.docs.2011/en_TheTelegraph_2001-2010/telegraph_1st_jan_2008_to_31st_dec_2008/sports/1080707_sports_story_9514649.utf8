The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sniper Mendis mows down Team India
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sniper Mendis mows down Team India
  - Massive 100-run victory for Sri Lankans in Asia Cup       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Karachi: It was a race between the President of Pakistan, a former Army chief, and a Sri Lankan soldier. Pervez Musharraf won, but only just.         
	Indeed, had Musharraf reached the National Stadium a little later, 23-year-old Ajantha Mendis wouldve completed his stunning demolition job in the Asia Cup final.         
	The match promised much, but saw Team India being thrashed by 100 runs, their second defeat in a final within weeks. And, so, Lankas hold on the continents premier competition got extended.         
	Musharraf, who gave away the trophy, didnt forget to take a dig at his own team (hes the Patron-in-Chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board). I must say the Pakistan team also showed a lot of hospitality in allowing two visiting teams to play the final!         
	The Board chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf, neednt lose sleep as Musharraf praised him. Shoaib Malik, however, is bound to feel more uneasy.         
	Not everybody was convinced that Lankas total of 273 (after losing the toss) was a winning one but, then, cricket does throw up unexpected results.         
	The Indians, quite simply, were outwitted by Mendis who largely bowls with the action of an off-spinner.         
	Mendis was brilliant and it was his day... Our batsmen couldnt pick him... We made a lethal mistake, confessed captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Weve got plans for Mendis... Yes, weve studied some tapes, had been coach Gary Kirstens boast on Saturday evening. Fact is the Indians never gave the impression that any homework had been done.         
	It was embarrassing and its to be seen whether the selectors back home are now going to review their policy of ignoring the Sourav Gangulys in ODIs.         
	You do need more experience at the top, former Pakistan captain Aamer Sohail told The Telegraph.         
	Team Indias tour of Sri Lanka begins within a fortnight and the Mahela Jayawardenes have been given a huge psychological advantage for the engagements ahead.         
	At a time when mind-games are in vogue, thats not done.         
	While Mendis is in the Army, hes kept out of the operational areas, idea being he can focus on cricket.         
	Well, even if Mendis isnt in combat gear, hes winning battles with no resistance. The Indians, for example, capitulated quicker than a minnow would against a hot favourite.         
	Adjudged both the MoS and the MoM, Mendis returned amazing figures of 8-1-13-6 to finish the Asia Cup with 17 wickets.         
	Jayawardene took Mendis off after only four overs (4-0-8-4) in his first spell, or else the final wouldve finished much faster than it did.         
	Mendis was as effective in his second spell, getting two wickets in those four overs.         
	Clearly, the Lankans had looked at the bigger picture in resting Mendis for the Super Four match against India last Thursday. They wanted to unleash him as a shock weapon and couldnt have bargained for a better result.         
	Ironically, the Indians got whipped despite fielding an extra batsman  Robin Uthappa for Praveen Kumar. At best, it was a strange selection because one wouldve expected five specialist bowlers on the flattest wicket in the world.         
	Rudra Pratap Singh and Irfan Pathan did pick up wickets, but again conceded plenty of runs. Rudra Prataps first over of his second spell cost as many as 26, all the runs going to Sanath Jayasuriya. Then, Pathans opening over went for 15.         
	Thanks to that Jayasuriya assault, the Lankans scored exactly 50 between the 15th and the 20th overs. It was a critical period and the pressure was off.         
	The veteran eventually got out for 125, proving yet again that age has nothing to do with delivering at the highest level.         
	The difference was the way Sanath batted, is how a delighted Jayawardene saluted the former captain.         
	For Team India, Virender Sehwag (60) and Dhoni (49) were the ones to make some contribution.         
	Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha, by the way, will return home with much to show. A rookie at the start of the tournament, he made the most of opportunities and was superb in the final.

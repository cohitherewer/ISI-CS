The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahela: We were 10-20 runs short
                                                   Mahela: We were 10-20 runs short
            A CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Adelaide: Mahela Jayawardene was all praise for Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhonis innings on Tuesday. The Sri Lankan captain said at the post-match press conference that the Indian duo adapted well to the situation and that made the difference in the end.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On the outcome         
	It was touch and go towards the end, mainly because we picked up a few wickets in the end and made it interesting. But I thought we were probably ten to 20 runs short The way we fielded today we gave away another 15 extra runs. It was a bit disappointing.         
	Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhonis innings         
	I thought both played two different innings in two different situations. When they lost wickets upfront, Yuvi came and got the momentum going while Dhoni finished off the game. It is difficult to say who was better but both batted really well in two different situations.         
	Kumar Sangakkaras innings         
	The role that Kumar and I have is to bat the majority of the overs if we dont get a great start. Kumar has been hitting the ball pretty well but didnt get enough support in the last few games. Today, I knew that I had to step in and both of us batted well. Kumar batted extremely well One of the best I have seen him play for quite some time.         
	What went wrong         
	When we picked up wickets, we knew that we had the opportunity to put some pressure. We lacked the effort when Yuvi came in and started taking a few chances and hitting a few balls here and there We were not consistent with our line and length. I thought we bowled a bit short and wide and at the same time, our fielding wasnt good..

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Board is practising apartheid, says Kapil
                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Board is practising apartheid, says Kapil
    - ICL chairman salutes Lanka cricket boss Arjuna Ranatunga             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Calcutta: Kapil Dev, the Indian Cricket League (ICL) chairman, has accused the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) of following apartheid on the lines of what was once practised (and abhorred) in South Africa.         
	Its nothing but a form of apartheid when the Board dictates that you can play with X but not with Y The South Africans did that when the Whites couldnt play with the non-Whites and vice-versa, a distinctly peeved Kapil told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Indias only World Cup-winning captain said so during the course of a telephonic chat which began with his saluting the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chairman, Arjuna Ranatunga, for allowing players with ICL links to turn out in domestic cricket.         
	Kapil added: Ive always admired Ranatunga Hed fight for his team Fight for his players Today, my admiration for him has gone up a few notches He has respected the right of a cricketer to earn his livelihood and, in the process, improve the quality of his life         
	Our own people, however, refuse to see reason Why should somebody who is with the ICL not be given the chance to showcase his talent in the tournaments run by the BCCI? Why call them rebels? Is it a crime to try and improve your standard of living?         
	Kapil confirmed (yes, a letter has gone) that the International Cricket Council had been requested to review the ban on those turning out in the ICL.         
	Even the Indian Premier League (IPL) is run privately If theres no problem with players going there, why this discrimination where the ICL is concerned? I see cricket as a form of education and nobody should have the right to stop somebody from learning.         
	Kapil continued: The IPL (which, to put it mildly, has the BCCIs blessings), Im told, has made millions Thats good, but Id like to know how much of that money has been put back into the game? Is there an improvement at the grassroots level? Are there more opportunities at the grassroots level?         
	Theres no point flexing ones muscles through money In fact, its deplorable that the BCCI has been threatening to blacklist sponsors who wish to be associated with the ICL Thats just not the way to promote cricket         
	Kapil expressed deep disappointment at the Bangladesh Cricket Boards decision to ban those who have joined the ICL.         
	Only one player from Bangladesh (Bangalore Royal Challengers Abdur Razzak) played in the IPL, that too in one match When nobody else was considered, why should the Habibul Bashars be penalised for joining the ICL? Surely, players from Bangladesh also have the right to a better life Why treat them as outcasts? The ones whove played for their country deserve to be respected right through         
	Edition No.2 of the ICL starts on October 10 and Kapil is mighty pleased about that, at least.         
	Im aware that a lot of people had said there would be nothing beyond the first year Well, here we are Weve even added a team (Dhaka Warriors) and I must compliment Mr Subhas Chandra for having the courage and faith to promote the ICL         
	Kapil signed off saying: Wish us luck.         
	Footnote: The BCCI hasnt been amused by Ranatungas decision and it could well actively encourage those in SLC who arent very fond of their straight-talking chairman. The Lalit Modis, though, should have seen it coming. Upul Chandana (who has joined the ICL), for example, had been on the podium during the post-match presentation after the Galle Test last month.

	Calcutta: Self-belief is the number one ingredient for success. Followed by hard work. So believes Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly. Surya was crowned the national champion in Chennai recently, his fifth title on the trot.         
	Back in the city on Saturday, Surya said that while claiming the title for the fifth time certainly gave him a lot of pleasure, it wasnt actually such a big deal.         
	It may sound arrogant but after all, it is the national championship, Surya told The Telegraph. My aim is higher, the perspective much broader.         
	After I became the GM in November 2002, I had targeted gaining the 2600 elo rating (the super GM) within the next two years. But it took me much longer for a number of reasons. I trained with Alexei Shirov in July last year, with (Viswanathan) Anand in November and now finally I have reached the 2600 mark, which will be made official in the Fide list to be released in April.         
	Now its target 2700 for me  and Im in a hurry to get there, said Surya who will turn 25 on Sunday.         
	Surya trains with Anand and Shirov whenever the two can make time for him. Back home, Sandipan Banerjee is his practice partner, once again when both of them can manage to be in the city at the same time.         
	While Surya, Sandipan and Neelotpal Das are in the forefront of the game in Bengal, the GM feels that Bitan Banerjee and Mary Ann Gomes are the two most promising players.         
	Surya, who enjoys doubling as a magician, loves chess from the bottom of his heart and respects it too. He signs off by saying that this is a must if one wishes to have a enduring partnership with the game.

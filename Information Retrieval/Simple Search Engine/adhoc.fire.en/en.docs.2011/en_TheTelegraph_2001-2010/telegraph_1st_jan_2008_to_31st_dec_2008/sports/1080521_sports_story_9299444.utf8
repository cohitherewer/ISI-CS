The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chennai on guard 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chennai on guard 
                      
	Chennai: Mahendra Singh Dhoni will lead the Chennai Super Kings but Parthiv Patel would don the keepers gloves when they host Bangalore Royal Challengers in an Indian Premier League match here on Wednesday.         
	Chennai coach Kepler Wessels said Dhoni, nursing a finger injury, has been cleared to play but the management is against taking any risk.         
	Dhoni will play against the Bangalore Royal Challengers. He has been ruled fit but he wont keep, Wessels said.         
	We are keeping options open and will assess his condition on Wednesday, Wessels said. Dhoni had injured his finger during the previous game against the Kolkata Knight Riders and Patel had to substitute him behind the wickets.         
	Though the Royal Challengers are expected to be easy meat for the hosts, Wessels said: They are still a dangerous side and we will not take them lightly.         
	They have nothing to lose So that will make them more determined.         
	 Though the hosts seem to be on their way for a semi-final berth, Wessels said winning the remaining three games were very important. In contrast, Royal Challengers look a slipshod combination struggling throughout the tournament.

  - CFL PREMIER DIVISION       A STAFF REPORTER            Maduaro Francis at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The East Bengal fans who came to the Salt Lake Stadium to see their favourite players in action against George Telegraph in the Sahara CFL Premier Division match on Thursday, were an unhappy lot at the end of the match.         
	While East Bengal coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee was found wanting when it came to strategies, his wards were listless against Raghu Nandys boys. The 1-1 result is something the red-and-gold brigade can feel lucky about as George were the dominant lot throughout the match.         
	The frailties in the East Bengal defence were exposed by their rivals and that is ominous for Bhattacharjees team before Sundays big match against Mohammedan Sporting. East Bengal took the lead in the sixth minute of second-half with Alvito D Cunha tapping in a Goutam Kujur lob.         
	Twelve minutes later, George were paid for their hard work. Several forays into the East Bengal defence saw them restore parity through Man-of-the-Match Maduaro Francis. Grabbing a through-pass from Suvo Kumar, Francis made his way past Nirmal Chhetri and Khelemba Singh, before unleashing a left-footer to score the equaliser.         
	While Nirmal Chhetri and Khelemba were caught gasping in the defence, midfielders  Mehtab Hossain, Sanju Pradhan and Jayanta Sen  never looked threatening. Alvito, who was pushed to the forward line in the second half, did not find any support from Ashim Biswas.Even the replacements could not make any difference.         
	However, only a minute after conceding the equaliser, East Bengal surged into the opponent box, almost finding their way. Alvito ran into the George box from the left. But custodian Swarup Das fist sent the ball out of the ground. East Bengal now have four points from two outings, while George have five from three matches.

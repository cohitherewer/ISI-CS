                                                     Whos Hayden, asks Harbhajan
  - You only need to speak to international cricketers to know in what opinion they hold him       A STAFF REPORTER amp; AGENCIES            Harbhajan Singh                                 
	Sydney/Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh reckons that Matthew Haydens stinging verbal attack at him stems from the frustration of realising that the Australians were no longer the undisputed champions and that India were the only team capable of giving them a run for their money.         
	Maybe they realise that they no longer are the undisputed world champions. Maybe they feel the crown is slipping. Otherwise, why would a cricket veteran ask a 19-year-old (Ishant Sharma) to join him in a boxing ring? he said in reaction to the latest provocation by Hayden.         
	Hayden called Harbhajan an obnoxious little weed and invited Ishant into a ring in an interview to Brisbane Radio on Tuesday.         
	Asked by reporters at the Hobart airport for his reaction to Haydens comments, Harbhajan asked: Whos Hayden?         
	He went on to say: I dont want to be involved in a slanging match. He said that he didnt want to open a Pandoras Box for a lot that the Australians have said this summer would then come tumbling out.         
	You only need to speak to international cricketers and teams to know in what opinion they hold Hayden.         
	Harbhajan was also surprised at the Australian openers statement which said that Indians were complaining because they are losing every game they are playing.         
	Really, you think so? I would have thought we are the only ones who have got the Australians on the run this summer, he said.         
	Apart from Hayden getting embroiled with Harbhajan and Ishant, there was another specific incident when Ricky Ponting had a go at Harbhajan during the game between the two teams in Adelaide on February 17.         
	Apparently, Ponting kept having a go at Harbhajan, asking him to show what he had got in the middle.         
	Harbhajan, on his part, had then cheekily remarked: Mate, whatever I have shown in the middle has been better than yours in the series so far.         
	It appeared to have stung the Australian captain who asked Harbhajan to F*** off after the latter was dismissed. A departing Harbhajan, on hearing so, stopped and turned round only to see Ponting disappear among celebrating Aussies.         
	They do it so well, Harbhajan said grudgingly they keep the back to you when they have something nasty to say to the opponent.                 (PTI)

	Berlin: Dinara Safina of Russia fought back from a set down for the third time in the tournament to win the German Open on Sunday with a 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 victory over seventh-seeded compatriot Elena Dementieva.         
	The 22-year-old came from behind to beat world No.1 Justine Henin and eight-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams en route to the final, where she captured her sixth career singles title.         
	The 13th seed was erratic in the first set but came back strongly in the second with some lusty hitting and won it with an ace down the middle.         
	She then broke twice in the deciding set and sealed victory when Dementieva netted a backhand return on the first match point after just over two hours of play on the clay at the Steffi Graf Stadium.         
	Dementieva will climb to seventh in the world from ninth when the rankings are updated on Monday. A former top-10 player, Safina is projected to rise to No. 14 from 17.         
	Safina won euro127,000 (US$197,000) for the win on Sunday, which is Mothers Day.         
	My mother can buy anything she wants, said Safina. She can walk into any store and I will pay for it.         
	The 22-year-old Safina, the sister Marat Safin, has now beaten top-10 players 11 times.           (AGENCIES)

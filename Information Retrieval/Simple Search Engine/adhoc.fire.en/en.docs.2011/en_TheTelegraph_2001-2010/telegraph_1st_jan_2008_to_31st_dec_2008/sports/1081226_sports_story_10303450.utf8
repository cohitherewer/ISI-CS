The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villas chance to astonish further 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Villas chance to astonish further 
                  Nicolas Anelka                     
	London: Aston Villa have what could be their best chance to crash the Premier League title race over Christmas with the opportunity to put one of their rivals out of the running and close the gap on the leaders.         
	While most teams  including top-side Liverpool and second-place Chelsea, have to play twice in three days over the traditionally hectic holiday period  Villa host Arsenal on Friday and visit Hull on Tuesday in a game rearranged for the TV schedules.         
	The extra rest could prove crucial as Villa try to force their way into a title race that no team has been able to dominate.         
	Liverpool, who are set to play Bolton and Newcastle, still lead despite having drawn four of their last five matches. Chelsea have won just one of five games and fourth-place Manchester United, who return to their title defence after becoming world club champions in Japan, have dropped points in three of their last six.         
	So, a second win over Arsenal in six weeks could effectively eliminate the inconsistent Gunners from a race they have rarely appeared capable of entering and even give Villa a chance to improve upon their current third place if Chelsea were to drop points in their matches against West Bromwich Albion and Fulham.         
	Last months 2-0 win at Emirates Stadium showed Villa can compete with the so-called Big Four despite their smaller squad and resources, but manager Martin Neill is downplaying his teams chances.         
	I wouldnt want to start thinking that we are better than we are, Neill said. We are doing fine and it has been a great effort by the team.         
	With defender Martin Laursen a doubt for the game because of a knee injury, Villa will be glad that Arsenal will be without captain Cesc Fabregas because of a knee injury. The Gunners have laboured even with the Spain midfielder, but his likely four-month absence could end up leaving them even lower than the fifth place they currently occupy.         
	If Manchester City or Tottenham, both of which are flirting with relegation, had lived up to their preseason billing as possible contenders for fifth place, Arsenal could have even been struggling to qualify for the Uefa Cup.         
	As it is, another good performance by striker Gabriel Agbonlahor, who scored in Villas 2-0 win at Emirates Stadium, could hit Arsenals chances of making the Champions League next season.         
	Agbonlahor could again lead the attack on his own in the absence of injured striker John Carew.         
	Gabbys development has been surprising, Villa captain Gareth Barry said. His overall game has come together quicker than I would have thought. His pace and directness is frightening for defenders but he is picking up bits and pieces along the way and scoring lots of goals.         
	Agbonlahor has hit nine league goals this season, lesser only than Chelseas Nicolas Anelka.         
	Anelka could be joined upfront by Didier Drogba as Chelsea try to return to their free-scoring form of early season. The Blues have drawn with Newcastle, West Ham and Everton in their last five matches, apart from losing to Arsenal.         
	Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari is without captain John Terry for the visit of West Brom after he was sent off against Everton, leaving Alex and Branislav Ivanovic as his likely central defensive partnership.         
	Ricardo Carvalho has not played since October 29 because of a knee injury and is not ready to return, although there is a slight possibility he could play at Fulham on Sunday.         
	Any slip up by the Blues could also give United, who are at Stoke on Friday, the chance to haul themselves closer to the top.         
	Also Friday, Bolton are at Liverpool, Hull at Manchester City, Everton at Middlesbrough, West Ham at Portsmouth, Blackburn at Sunderland, Fulham at Tottenham, and Newcastle at Wigan.         
	Sundays fixture list reads: Arsenal vs. Portsmouth, Blackburn vs. Manchester City, Bolton vs. Wigan, Everton vs. Sunderland, Fulham vs. Chelsea, Newcastle vs. Liverpool, West Brom vs. Tottenham, West Ham vs. Stoke.

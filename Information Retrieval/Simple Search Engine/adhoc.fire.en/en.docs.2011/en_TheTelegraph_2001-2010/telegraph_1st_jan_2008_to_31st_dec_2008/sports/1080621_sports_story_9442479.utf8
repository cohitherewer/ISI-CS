                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ronaldo not for sale, insist United
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Cristiano Ronaldo                           
	Manchester United have insisted Cristiano Ronaldo is not for sale despite comments from the player that he wants to join Real Madrid.         
	Ronaldo was part of the Portugal team beaten 2-3 by Germany in the Euro 2008 quarter final on Thursday, after which he spoke of his future plans. Asked about a move to Madrid, Ronaldo said: The possibilities to go are great, but as I have always said it doesnt always depend on me.         
	In the next few days, we will see if we can arrive at an agreement. I have many desires and in the next few days they will become clear. I will make an announcement on my future in two or three days.         
	United, however, have acted swiftly to Ronaldos comments and a statement on the clubs website on Friday reads: Further to Fridays press speculation about where Cristiano Ronaldos future lies, the club has moved to reiterate its stance on the matter United are not listening to offers.         
	The club reaffirmed to a website on Friday morning that the 23-year-old United star is not for sale.         
	United have complained to Fifa about Madrids pursuit of their star player, although footballs world governing body found the Spanish club had not contravened any of its regulations.         
	As such, Madrid may still launch a 50 million bid for the 23-year-old, whose Old Trafford contract runs until 2012.         
	However, the Spanish champions have said they will only do so when Ronaldo publicly declares his desire to leave United.         
	Real said: Were waiting for Cristiano to make a statement. Whenever he says he wants to play for Real Madrid, there would be conversations between the two clubs.         
	We would be delighted to reach an agreement with Manchester if the possibility exists, that is, if they want to sell and the price were reasonable.

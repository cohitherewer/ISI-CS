The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gautam Gambhir ban upheld
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gautam Gambhir ban upheld
    - Rattled BCCI doesnt accept Justice Sachs decision           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Nagpur: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has been caught off guard by Appeals Commissioner Justice Albie Sachs decision to uphold the one-Test ban on in-terrific-form opener Gautam Gambhir.         
	That surfaced through a confusion-creating media release from secretary N. Srinivasans office, which stated Mr Vijay of Tamil Nadu had been included in the squad for the final Test against Australia, to be played at the new facility here from Thursday.         
	The correction came half-an-hour later. M. Vijay of Tamil Nadu has been included...         
	Such confusion isnt expected, no matter how trying the circumstances. But, then, an allowance perhaps has to be made for South African Justice Sachs blow, as somebody put it.         
	The BCCI hasnt accepted the Appeals Commissioners decision, but where the International Cricket Council (ICC) is concerned, the matter is closed. The Appeals Commissioners decision is final and binding, a spokesman told The Telegraph from Dubai.         
	Significantly, Gambhir (punished by Match Referee Chris Broad for elbowing allrounder Shane Watson in the Kotla Test last week), is still with the India squad at the Pride Hotel.         
	Weve only been informed that Vijay is coming tomorrow (Wednesday) morning, nothing more... There are no instructions for Gambhir to go home (New Delhi), a member of the support staff said late on Tuesday.         
	Does the BCCI then intend to defy the ICC?         
	Frankly, I have no idea... Dont know what the plans are... Wait for the morning... Weve just been told that Justice Sachs has upheld the ban, maintained a member of the team management.         
	The BCCIs strong letter (sent by Srinivasan) to ICC president David Morgan notwithstanding, its not clear what options it has.         
	Srinivasans letter includes the following:         
	I have to state that the said order of the Appeals Commissioner seems to be pre-decided as the same has been passed without affording the player an opportunity of a personal hearing...         
	I submit that the decision/order of the Appeals Commissioner is void ab initio and non est as it contravenes mandatory provisions relating to hearing of appeals and also as being in violation of principles of natural justice... The BCCI does not accept the said decision of the Appeals Commissioner and objects to the same.         
	Justice Sachs, who as arbiter in July 2005 had reduced (the-then captain) Sourav Gangulys punishment by one-third, has accepted that Gambhir had been provoked.         
	[Broad, incidentally, had been the Match Referee then as well. Obviously, hes quite fond of Indian cricketers.]         
	At the same time, though, Justice Sachs has contended that cricket is not a contact sport and that deliberate collision can never be condoned, however grave the provocation.         
	Till late at night, no BCCI official, not even city-based president Shashank Manohar, was available for an update.         
	Footnote: According to one of the selectors, 24-year-old Vijay (actually, Murali Vijay Krishna in the records) will open with Virender Sehwag, unless there are dramatic developments. Vijay has been among the runs, but hes also from the same state as chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth and the BCCI secretary.  
	Fact File  The following is the fact file of Murali Vijay Krishna who has been added to the India squad for the fourth and final Test in Nagpur:   Name: Murali Vijay Krishna
  Age: 24
  Batting style: Right-hand opener

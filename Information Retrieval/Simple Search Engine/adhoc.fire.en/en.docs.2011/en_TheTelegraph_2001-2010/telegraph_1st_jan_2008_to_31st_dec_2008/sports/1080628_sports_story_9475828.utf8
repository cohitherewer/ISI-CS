  - Serena packs off Mauresmo             Roger Federer in action on Friday                           
	Wimbledon: Top-seeded Ana Ivanovic was knocked out in the third round of Wimbledon on Friday by 133rd-ranked Zheng Jie of China, extending a spate of stunning upsets at the All England Club.         
	Roger Federer continued his march toward a sixth straight Wimbledon title by beating Marc Gicquel in straight sets, setting up a fourth-round matchup with the last man to win the championship before him.         
	Ivanovic went out a day after 2004 champion and third-seeded Maria Sharapova was ousted by 154th-ranked Alla Kudryavtseva and two-time mens runner-up Andy Roddick was bounced by Janko Tipsarevic. A day earlier, Australian Open champion and No. 3-ranked Novak Djokovic fell to Marat Safin.         
	Ivanovic could now lose the No. 1 ranking depending on how far No. 2 Jelena Jankovic and No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetsova advance in the tournament.         
	Other title favourites fared better Friday.         
	Two-time womens champion Serena Williams dispatched 2006 winner Amelie Mauresmo 7-6 (7-5), 6-1, extending her supremacy over the Frenchwoman to a career record of 10-2.         
	After the first rain delay of the tournament, Federer overwhelmed the 53rd-ranked Frenchman 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 on Centre Court for his 62nd consecutive win on grass and 37th straight at the All England Club.         
	His next opponent will be Lleyton Hewitt, who won Wimbledon in 2002  the year before the Swiss star began his run of five straight titles.         
	Federer surprisingly dropped serve in the opening game. But he immediately broke back and was in control the rest of the way as he sailed to victory in 1 hour, 21 minutes. The rain delay before the match lasted longer  1 hour, 41 minutes  the first rain of the tournament.         
	Hewitt, who has been troubled by a chronic hip injury and is seeded No. 20, served 14 aces and beat Italys Simone Bolelli 6-1, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).         
	Federer leads Hewitt 13-7 in career meetings and has won 11 straight going back to the Australian Open in 2004. They have played twice before at Wimbledon, with Federer winning in the quarter finals in 2004 and semi-finals in 2005.         
	In other womens play, advancing in third-round matches were No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetsova, No. 8 Anna Chakvetadze, No. 14 Agnieszka Radwanska, No. 15 Agnes Szavay and No. 18 Nicole Vaidisova.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Srinagar: A glancing header by stopper back Gourmangi Singh in the 14th minute steered India to a 1-0 victory over hosts Maldives in the concluding group league SAFF Cup match at Male on Saturday.         
	India, however, suffered a major blow in the second half when Samir Naik was given the marching order in the 63rd minute for a second yellow card offence. Naiks suspension will complicate Indias calculations in the semi-finals and is a major setback for them as another defender  NS Manju  is already out of the tournament because of a hamstring injury.         
	India, who have won all their three matches, have topped the group with nine points. In the semi-finals to be played at the same venue, India are likely to play either Sri Lanka or Bangladesh.         
	According to information received here, India rested seven of their frontline players in the match yet surged ahead in the 14th minute when Gourmangi headed in perfectly off a cross from stand-in skipper Rennedy Singh from the left.

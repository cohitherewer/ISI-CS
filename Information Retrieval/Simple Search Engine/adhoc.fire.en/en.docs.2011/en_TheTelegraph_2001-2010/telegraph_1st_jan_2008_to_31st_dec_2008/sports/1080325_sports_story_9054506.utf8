The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Adam retirement a loss: Boucher
                                                   Adam retirement a loss: Boucher
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                Mark Boucher      
	Chennai: Test crickets No.1 wicketkeeper (425 dismissals), South Africas 31-year-old Mark Boucher, briefly spoke to The Telegraph on Monday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether hes relieved that Adam Gilchrist, whod briefly got past him as the most successful in Tests, has retired         
	Not relieved, well... I dont think you should judge only on the number of dismissals... It doesnt necessarily hold that the most number of dismissals will make you the best keeper... Im happy that Gilchrist wont be around when we tour Australia later this year, but his retirement is a loss for the game... If you talk of the best wicketkeeper-batsman of all time, Gilchrist would be the one right at the top...         
	On being No.1 in Tests         
	Its a nice feeling, thats for sure... Of course, Ive been fortunate in that keepers get opportunities to bring off a good number of catches in South African conditions and Ive tried to make the most.         
	Whether he agrees with Ian Healy, the elder statesman among keepers, that the ones wearing the big gloves shouldnt be full-time captains         
	(Grins) Absolutely, and I say this from experience... Its best that a keeper is allowed to focus on just the next ball, instead of worrying about field placements and bowling changes... The demand on concentration is very high and, clearly, somebody else could do the captaining.         
	Finally, his thoughts on Mahendra Singh Dhoni         
	His keeping has improved... It seems he has been working hard on wicketkeeping... But, yes, if you concentrate only on the keeping then your batting could see a slump... It happened to me... So, youve got to strike a balance and Im sure Dhoni can do that.         
	Earlier, after the days training at the Chepauk, Boucher had a session with the media in general.         
	The following are excerpts         
	It feels good to be in India... One has had a mental break (after the Test series in Bangladesh) and Im looking forward to the first day of the series...         
	Its been hot and humid, but nothing that we havent faced before... I think the guys will lose weight on this tour!         
	Sledging... All the players are mature enough to know... Sledging will always be there when you have two very competitive sides... As long as its above board, I wouldnt want it taken away from the game... (Adds laughing) If you do something, you should do it a clever way and both teams will be looking for that clever way.         
	Harbhajan (Singh) and I will put on the boxing gloves after the series... No, weve never over-stepped the line...         
	I dont worry too much about the conditions, nor about the opposition... As a batsman, Id like to try and get that mix of aggression and defense... But, to be aggressive, you need to get into a position where you can be so.         
	As regards Gary Kirsten and Paddy Upton... Im sure theyll share some information (with Team India) but, eventually, the game is played with bat and ball...

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo stays with United
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ronaldo stays with United
                      
	Manchester: Portugal striker Cristiano Ronaldo ended the close seasons most drawn out transfer saga on Thursday, deciding to stick with European champion Manchester United for next season at least and spurning Real Madrids efforts to sign him.         
	Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, keenly aware the gifted goal scorer could face a hostile reception from home fans, issued a passionate defence of Ronaldo, who apologised for sparking the rift between the clubs.         
	Despite affirming his loyalty to the European and English champion for the upcoming season at least, the Portugal star still dreams of playing in Spain, saying he thought the world record-breaking transfer fee offered by Real Madrid and rejected by United would have been fair compensation for his departure.         
	Im not going to be a hypocrite and say the opposite of what I think, like some others do, Ronaldo was quoted as telling Thursdays edition of a Portuguese newspaper.         
	I said exactly what I thought. I have a dream of playing at Real and I thought it was time to move on.         
	Throughout the drawn-out transfer saga, which Ronaldo admits to stoking up, Ferguson reserved his anger for Madrid and shielded his prized asset.         
	Ferguson reacted sympathetically to Ronaldos announcement that he intends to stay, urging fans to recognise why Ronaldo would have been tempted to move to Madrid and thus boost his weekly pay to 120,000.         
	The 23-year-old will only return to action in October after recovering from ankle surgery.         
	The fans have got to understand that a young boy can be tempted by all this money, Ferguson said. Ronaldo said he was seeking a new challenge.         
	After wed won the Champions League, I felt that in five years I had helped win everything there was to win, Ronaldo said.         
	I never hid the fact that I wanted to play at Real Madrid in particular, and I thought this could be the right moment. (AP)

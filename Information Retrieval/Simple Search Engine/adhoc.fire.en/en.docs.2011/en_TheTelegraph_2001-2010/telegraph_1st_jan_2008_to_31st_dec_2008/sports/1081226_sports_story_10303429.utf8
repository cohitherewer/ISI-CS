The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smiths elbow on mend
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Smiths elbow on mend
                      
	Melbourne: South African captain Graeme Smith is prepared to do anything including injection of his own blood into his injured elbow in a bid to lead his side to a historic first-ever series win in Australia.         
	South Africa won the first Test in Perth by six wickets and if they win the second of the three-match series starting Friday at the MCG they would become the first team in the world since 1992-93 to defeat Australia on home soil.         
	Smith, who set up the sensational victory in Perth with a brilliant century, has been battling a painful tennis elbow, which he suffered while playing for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League earlier this year, and played the first Test with cortisone injections.         
	But the painkilling injections has left his elbow badly bruised and Smith has been unable to train fully, although he will be fit to play for the Boxing Day Test.         
	Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Greg Hoy has suggested Smith could even have his own blood injected into his elbow to try to stimulate blood flow and fast-track healing process.         
	Cortisone was one that never worked, there is other suggestions of injections of blood into it and stuff like that which sounds a bit gory. If it doesnt work I might end up having to have surgery, Smith said.         
	The opening batsman admitted the right elbow problem restricts his range of shots, particularly his drives which require a strong top-hand force.         
	There are certain aspects of my game where it does hurt more but it has been going on for so long now that I think mentally its just dealing with it as best I can. Ive been fortunate that Ive batted well through the injury and Ive been able to adapt my game to it a bit, he was quoted as saying.         
	Smith indicated he may have to miss the one-day series against Australia in January just after the three Tests in a bid to get fully fit for Australias Test tour of South Africa in February-March.         
	There is an important tour to South Africa after the Tests and one-dayers next year so we need to make decisions that are in the best interests going forward, he said. (PTI)

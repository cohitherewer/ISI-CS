The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Middlesbrough hold United to 2-2 draw
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Middlesbrough hold United to 2-2 draw

	London: Manchester United ended the weekend three points clear of Chelsea with five Premier League games remaining after being held to a 2-2 draw at relegation-threatened Middlesbrough on Sunday.         
	United led through Cristiano Ronaldo but after two well-taken goals by Boros record signing Afonso Alves either side of halftime, the champions needed an equaliser from Wayne Rooney 16 minutes from time.         
	United lead the way with 77 points to the 74 of Chelsea, who won 2-0 at Manchester City on Saturday. Arsenal are third on 71 after drawing 1-1 with fourth-placed Liverpool. United, who have a far superior goal difference to the two other contenders, host Arsenal next weekend and still have to visit Chelsea.         
	Middlesbrough are now four places and nine points clear of the relegation zone and should begin to relax.         
	In Sundays other league game Everton moved back to within three points of fourth-placed Liverpool with a 1-0 home win over relegated Derby County. Midfielder Leon Osman got the goal after 56 minutes to take Everton to 60 points but, with an inferior goal difference and tough games against Chelsea and Arsenal to come, the Champions League place probably looks out of reach for the Toffees.                     
	United started well and deserved their early lead, secured when Ronaldo tucked in his 27th league goal of the season from a low Michael Carrick cross.         
	Boro levelled in the 35th minute when Brazil striker Alves, signed from Heerenveen on the last day of the transfer window in January, scored his first goal for the club when he ran on to a long ball to finish with confidence.         
	Alves, who scored 34 goals in 31 Dutch league games last season, then showed why Boro paid 12m for him, neatly finishing after another long ball caused problems for United, who sorely missed the injured Nemanja Vidic and lost his centre-back partner Rio Ferdinand during Sundays game.         
	United, though, also looked dangerous and levelled when Park Ji-sung crossed from the right for Rooney to snatch a point.         
	It was a fair result, United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports. There was a period in the second half when I had to re-arrange the back four and we could have lost two or three goals. But its in the nature of our club to never give in, its a marvellous quality and they proved it again today.         
	Weve got a point today, I looked upon this as a difficult fixture. They dont get big crowds here normally but when Manchester United and other big teams come it lifts them.         
	Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate was delighted to see a return from his investment in Alves.         
	Weve been waiting for lift-off really, he said of the Brazilian. I knew it would take time for him to settle in but hes given people a glimpse of what he can do.

	Hyderabad: Australia captain Ricky Ponting scored an unbeaten half century Sunday, leading his team to a draw in the warm-up match against the Board Presidents XI.         
	Chasing an improbable victory target of 434 after a late declaration by Board Presidents XI captain Yuvraj Singh on the last day of the four-day game, Australia were 127 for two when stumps were drawn with Ponting on 58 and vice-captain Michael Clarke on 36.         
	Ponting struck two sixes and seven boundaries in 97 deliveries as he put on 75 with Clarke, whose 70-ball innings contained five fours.         
	Resuming the day on 110-2, the Board Presidents XI made 292 for four with Yuvraj hitting an attacking 113 and opener Wasim Jaffer posting 93 to press their claims for recall to the Indian Test squad.

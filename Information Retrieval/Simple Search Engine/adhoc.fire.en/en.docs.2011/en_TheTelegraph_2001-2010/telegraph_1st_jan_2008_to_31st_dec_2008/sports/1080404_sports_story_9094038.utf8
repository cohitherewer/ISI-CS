                                                   Absence to affect ticket sales
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The BCCIs decision to not allow Shoaib Akhtar to participate in the Indian Premier League is sure to reflect on the ticket sales during Kolkata Knight Riders matches at the Eden.         
	CAB president Prasun Mukherjee did not wish to say anything on the decision. I am not in a position to say anything But theres no doubt Shoaib is an attraction, he said.         
	A spokesman for the Shah Rukh Khan owned franchise also admitted Shoaibs absence would be of consequence when the tickets are up for sale early next week.         
	The ticket rates for matches at the Eden will go up by nine per cent (approximately) after Knight Riders Sport Pvt Ltd, a newly-formed subsidiary of Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd, decided to levy an additional service charge and service tax. This, however, will not be applicable to members of the CAB  life, annual, associate and honorary.         
	Mukherjee said that: An eight per cent service charge would be levied on the price of tickets and an additional 12 per cent service tax on the eight per cent.         
	This follows a series of meeting between the CAB, Knight Riders Sport Pvt Ltd and Ticket Pro Pvt Ltd, the ticket-selling arm for the Calcutta leg matches.         
	The representatives will meet the Calcutta Police on Friday before announcing the date and venues for the sale of tickets. The daily ticket rates had earlier been fixed at Rs 200, 300 and 600. The seasonal tickets were fixed at Rs 1050, 1750 and 3500.

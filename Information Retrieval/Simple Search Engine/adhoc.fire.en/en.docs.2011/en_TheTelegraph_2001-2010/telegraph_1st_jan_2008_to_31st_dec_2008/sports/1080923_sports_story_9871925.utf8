The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaibs career in danger
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shoaibs career in danger
                      
	Karachi: Uncertainty looms large over Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtars career after his lawyer failed to show up in Lahore High court on Monday, prompting the Court to adjourn the proceedings until October 3.         
	The High Court issued notice to the pacers lawyer to make a mandatory appearance in the court at the next date so as to start the proceedings on the Pakistan Cricket Boards application to get directives if Shoaib can play domestic or international cricket without paying a Rs 7 million fine.         
	The PCB has now asked the court to give a clear cut order if Shoaib can play in the national Twenty20 championship legally, starting from October 4 and on his selection in the national team in case if he does not pay the fine first. The fine was imposed on Shoaib by an appellate tribunal of the PCB in June while reducing a five-year ban on to 18 months.         
	Shoaib, later, filed a writ petition with the Lahore High Court bench challenging the ban and fine. While the court has suspended the ban in an interim order, it didnt issue orders on payment of the fine.         
	In pure legal terms, Shoaib cant play in the domestic T20 championship or be considered for Pakistan until the fine issue is cleared, legal counsel for the PCB, Tafazzul Rizvi, said.         
	The PCB has said it wants Shoaib to play the T20 championship as the fine was a legal issue and would be resolved in time.         
	However, Rizvi made it clear that the Board had its point of view from a cricketing aspect, but legally the matter was now sub judice and the fast bowler had to pay the fine to play in Pakistan or for consideration in the national team.         
	I wouldnt like to comment further on this issue as it is with the court now and we are waiting for a clear directive from the court to assist us, he added.         
	Interestingly, doubts have now also been raised by unnamed selectors over Shoaibs fitness and form, after he failed to make an impact with the English county side Surrey in two first-class matches. Shoaib was given permission by the PCB to play for Surrey in a bid to assess his form and fitness, but reports say the selectors are not satisfied with the pacers performance.         
	The selectors face a dicey situation as does the Board, because of the legal implications of the fine issue. (PTI)

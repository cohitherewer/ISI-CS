 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 ICICI Securities managing director S. Mukherji flanked by Global Penson Services vice-president Warren Bunting (left) and Retail ICICI Securities head Anil Kaul in Mumbai on Monday. (Fotocorp)																								Mumbai, Oct. 8: Want to buy shares of Google, Yahoo or GE? You can scoop up shares in the worlds biggest companies from your desktop PC sitting here in India.																								ICICIdirect.com today launched an overseas trading service that will allow resident Indians to buy and sell equities, exchange traded funds and transact in stock and index options across US stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.																								ICICIdirect.com is the first online trading portal in India to offer this service.																								Indian residents can remit up to $200,000 in a single financial year under the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) liberalised remittance scheme to buy assets abroad.																								The online broking arm of ICICI Securities has teamed up with Penson Financial Services Inc, which is the fourth largest clearing and broker-dealer firm in the US. Penson handles about 10 lakh settlements daily and has over $6.8 billion in assets.																								To access the service, individuals will first have to pay a one-time nominal fee of Rs 999. However, payments to purchase stocks, including American depository receipts (ADRs), cannot be made in rupees. Customers will have to fund their overseas trading account with dollars.																								To do this, customers will have to go through a remittance process by visiting any ICICI Bank branch. The bank will debit the account at the prevailing foreign exchange rate and remit the funds by doing a wire transfer. While these funds are transferred within 72 hours of the request, it will take five working days to activate the overseas trading account.																								After purchasing securities, they will be kept in a street name (Penson) though the individual will be the beneficiary holder for those particular securities.																								Despite the time difference, individuals can put in overnight orders. They will have to pay a brokerage of 75 basis points of the traded value. The investor will, however, have to bear the currency risk.																								S. Mukherji, managing director and CEO of ICICI Securities, said the US equities markets were the most liquid and deepest in the world. Therefore, investors will be able to spread country and sectoral risks more effectively. Customers can not only invest in Fortune 500 companies, but also buy ADRs of companies from China and other countries.

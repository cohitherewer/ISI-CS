				 FM watch on capital inflow
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Chidambaram: Confident																								New Delhi, Oct. 26: The Congress-led government today said it wanted to moderate capital inflows without hurting growth and investment.																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram said, We want to moderate inflows. I have said one of the concerns is very sharp increase in capital flows. 																								He said the government would monitor the impact of the moves taken by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on participatory notes (P-notes). 																								However, he refused to be drawn into any discussion on possible steps to curb foreign exchange inflows. 																								Sebi yesterday announced measures to phase out participatory notes in derivatives trading. 																								We will have to see how they have worked. The idea was to moderate capital flows without hurting growth, Chidambaram said.																								P-note restrictions will ensure greater transparency in share trading, Chidambaram said.																								Sebi had also imposed curbs on P-notes in spot markets. It made registration of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and their sub-accounts permanent. 																								This means the FIIs will not have to renew their registration after every three years as is the case now. 																								The market regulator also allowed unregulated pension funds and education funds to register as FIIs.																								Politicians and bankers have warned that P-notes could be used to launder money, more so because overseas investors are not required to reveal their identity.																								Top finance ministry officials said policy-makers were unlikely to take any further steps immediately to curb inflows.																								Instead, we may bring in measures to encourage more foreign buyouts, using dollars held by Indian banks, the officials said.																								The economy is awash with cash following the huge inflow of dollars, pulling up the rupee to a record nine-year high against the greenback.																								The rupee has strengthened to the level of Rs 40 to the dollar after having touched almost Rs 50 last year.																								A bull run on the stock market has attracted huge investments from FIIs, while the booming economy is expected to attract up to $30 billion in foreign direct investment this year.

				 Reliance Money plans big 
 ARUNDHATI BAKSHI-DIGHE																								Mumbai, Nov. 28: You dont need a sackful of cash to get a personal wealth manager.																								Reliance Money, the financial services arm of Reliance Capital, is planning to lower the threshold in portfolio management by offering the service to anyone who can stump up Rs 5 lakh.																								In a professional portfolio management service (PMS), the portfolio manager offers to create a basket of stocks, bonds or even mutual funds that will fit your personal investment goals and risk preferences. Although the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the capital market regulator, has lowered the PMS threshold to Rs 5 lakh, most players tend to offer their services only to those who can come up with at least Rs 25 lakh.																								We want to move PMS from a high net worth individuals play to almost anyone and everyone who has Rs 5 lakh but doesnt have the time or the technical knowledge to play the markets, said Sudip Bandyopadhyay, director and CEO of Reliance Money. The company is looking to attract young professionals from metros and the Tier I and II cities. We are doing a soft launch in December and after that we will go to the rest of the country, he said.																								Reliance Moneys 3,000 outlets all over the country will serve as the channel for distribution. Bandyopadhyay said Reliance Money would not take a fee unless the portfolio earned a return higher than 8 per cent. If the client earns a return of 8 to 20 per cent, the fee charged will be 10 per cent of the absolute returns and if the client earns more than 20 per cent, the fee will be 20 per cent. 																								Even here most players charge a fee irrespective of whether they can eke out the promised returns. We plan to offer three schemes  a large-cap investment portfolio, where the stocks invested in will be those of large-cap companies, blue chip portfolio and an infrastructure portfolio, said Bandyopadhyay.

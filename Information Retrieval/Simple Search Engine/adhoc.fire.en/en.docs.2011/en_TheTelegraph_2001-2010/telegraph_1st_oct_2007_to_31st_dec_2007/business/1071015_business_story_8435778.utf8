				 Jindals jump iron ore wall 
 SAMBIT SAHA 				 	 Green signal																								Calcutta, Oct. 14: Sajjan Jindals JSW Steel has obtained exploration rights to an iron ore reserve in Jharkhand. This relates to its proposed 10-million-tonne plant in the state.																								The company has received the prospecting licence for 1,388.5 hectares, or 14 square kilometres, of land at Ankua, which is close to the Steel Authority of India Limiteds Chiria mines.																								The development comes at a time when companies are vying for mining leases in the country.																								Domestic firms, such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Essar and Ispat Industries, and foreign players, such as ArcelorMittal, Posco and Sinosteel, have applied for leases in many states.																								However, none of them has met with success. There are a number of applicants for the Ankua area itself.																								The Centre cleared JSWs licence last month, though the company didnt confirm the development. We do not comment on market speculation, said Seshagiri Rao, director of JSW Steel.																								If it finds good ore, the companys Jharkhand plant will be its first large-scale unit to have a captive mine.																								JSW partly meets the ore requirement for its Vijaynagar plant in Karnataka from captive sources.																								The proposals for steel plants in states such as Jharkhand, Orissa and Chattisgarh are linked to iron and coal mines, to be provided by the state governments.																								The allocation of mining leases is a long-drawn process that is delaying big-ticket investments in these states.																								However, in Bengal, companies are not depending on captive iron ore in new projects. Following the Chinese model, Jai Balaji will make steel using iron-ore fines.																								JSW has been seeking from Jharkhand a lease for 500 million tonnes (mt) of iron ore over a period of 30 years.																								The company has committed itself to make an investment of Rs 35,000 crore in the Jharkhand project, which is in Saraikela district. The project also involves a 900-mega-watt power plant.																								JSWs Vijaynagar unit has a capacity of 3.8mt. The company plans to increase it to 10mt in phases.																								The companys Bengal plant will also have a 10mt capacity, to be built in three phases.																								If both the projects take off, JSW will get a stronger foothold in the domestic market.																								JSW is among the 51 companies to have received either a mining lease or a prospecting licence during this fiscal.																								The mining leases and the prospecting licences have been given mostly to smaller companies. 																								The Centre has given 13 concessions in Andhra Pradesh, 10 in Chattisgarh, six in Karnataka, five in Jharkhand, four in Madhya Pradesh, three each in Rajasthan and Goa, two in Orissa and one in Assam.

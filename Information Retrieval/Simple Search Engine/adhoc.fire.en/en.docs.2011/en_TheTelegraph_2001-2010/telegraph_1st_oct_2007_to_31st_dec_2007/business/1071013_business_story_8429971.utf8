 OUR BUREAU				 	 Chidambaram: Pessimistic																								Delhi/Mumbai, Oct. 12: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today talked down the ebullient sensex after he blamed speculators for stoking the recent surge in the stock markets.																								I hope things will cool down soon, the finance minister said in the capital  a comment that sent the bellwether index skidding over 500 points after it hit an intra-day high of 18844.62. The index closed at 18419.04, a fall of 395 points over its previous close of 18814.																								The steep rise in the sensex sometimes surprises me, sometimes worries me. I do not think the fundamentals change so rapidly day-to-day. Our assessment tells us the sensex is driven by copious inflow of funds, Chidambaram told invitees to a business summit in New Delhi.																								Market mavens interpreted the finance ministers comment as an indication that the government could come up with measures to rein in foreign portfolio investments.																								Observers said disappointment over Reliance Industries not announcing a bonus or a stock split at its annual general meeting also contributed to the fall. Reliance, the sensex scrip with the most weight, saw its shares slipping Rs 62.80 to Rs 2,566.85. 																								Banking and IT stocks also suffered, while there was profit-booking in heavyweights such as Larsen and Toubro, which was in the limelight yesterday. Analysts have been warning of a major correction as funds pause to take stock of gains. They said Chidambarams comments just gave them an opportunity to sell. 																								Rupee fall																								Another comment by the finance minister at the summit about the rupee not being in the comfort zone had an effect on the currency. 																								Ruling at nine-year highs, the rupee ended at 39.36 to the dollar, weaker than the earlier close of 39.31.

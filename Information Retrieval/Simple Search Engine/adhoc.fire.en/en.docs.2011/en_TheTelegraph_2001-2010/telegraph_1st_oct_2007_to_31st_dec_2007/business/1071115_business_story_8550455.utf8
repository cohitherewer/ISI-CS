				 DLF rules out foreign buyouts
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 14: Real estate company DLF Limited is not interested in overseas acquisitions. The company is planning to expand in the domestic hospitality segment. 																								There is nothing to comment  we dont know from where these reports have emanated nor the source. At present, we are not looking at overseas acquisitions, Rajeev Talwar, group executive director of DLF, told The Telegraph. Talwar was responding to reports of DLF taking over Amanresorts, the Singapore-based luxury hotels and spa chain, for $250 million.																								Big companies (such as Amanresorts) may be on the lookout (for funds) ... but there has been no official communication from either side on this issue, Talwar added. 																								A newspaper report today said the deal between DLF and Amanresorts was being finalised at extremely conservative valuation. In addition to paying $250 million, DLF would assume a debt of around $220 million as part of the deal. We are tying up with international hotel chains to get investments into India, but are not buying properties outside, Talwar said. 																								DLF is the countrys largest realty firm with a market capitalisation of Rs 1,48,527 crore.

				 Mutuals reach asset milestone
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Surging numbers																								Mumbai, Nov. 7: The assets under management of mutual funds have crossed the Rs 500,000-crore mark.																								Assets in October stood at Rs 560,000 crore compared with Rs 480,000 crore in September, an increase of 17 per cent.																								On a year-on-year basis assets rose by 80.64 per cent from Rs 310,000 crore in October 2006.																								According to a Crisil report, all 32 fund houses have recorded a surge in their assets during the month. This could primarily be attributed to the rise in the equity market, large corpus raised by new fund offerings, lower redemptions and availability of liquidity in the banking industry that witnessed short term fund flows into liquid schemes, said Krishnan Sitaraman, head of fund services and fixed income research at Crisil. 																								He said investors who withdrew from equity schemes, fearing a correction when the benchmark indices scaled new highs, reinvested the money into liquid and liquid-plus plans. 																								Reliance Mutual Fund continued to be the largest fund house with its assets swelling to almost Rs 80,000 crore in October. This was followed by ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund and UTI Mutual Fund with assets of Rs 56,300 and Rs 51,800 crore, respectively. A new entrant into the top-five list was Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, with assets of Rs 33,700 crore, piping Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund which had assets of Rs 32,300 crore. 																								In percentage terms, AIG Global Investment Group Mutual Fund saw maximum growth in assets of about 81 per cent at Rs 4,140 crore. In Canara Robeco Mutual Fund, assets grew 51 per cent to Rs 3,346 crore. 																								In October, the regulator offered relief to the industry. There was a hike in the investment limit in share issues and relaxation on the duration of short-term investments in bank deposits to 182 days from 91.

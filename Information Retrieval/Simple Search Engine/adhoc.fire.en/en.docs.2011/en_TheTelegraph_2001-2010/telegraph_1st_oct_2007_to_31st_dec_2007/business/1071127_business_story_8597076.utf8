				 Philips set to buy Genlyte
				 	 GROWTH POTION																								Amsterdam, Nov. 26 (Reuters): Philips Electronics is set to acquire US lighting maker Genlyte for $2.7 billion (1.8 billion euros), making it the top lighting company in North America.																								Philips, the worlds biggest lighting maker, a top hospital equipment maker and Europes biggest consumer electronics producer, said on Monday it had reached a deal with Genlyte for the all-cash offer.																								It will launch a tender offer of $95.50 per Genlyte share within five business days. The board of directors at Genlyte is backing the bid.																								Philips shares were up 1.7 per cent to 28.91 euros in early morning trade outperforming a 1.2 per cent rise in Amsterdams blue-chip index .																								Genlyte makes a perfect strategic fit for Philips, allowing the Dutch company to push into the energy-saving lightings market in the US, said Rabo Securities analyst Frits de Vries.																								Philips is paying a full price. The 2007 enterprise value to sales multiple is 1.7, the 2007 enterprise value/EBITDA is 9.9. We believe this price can be justified given Genlytes higher margins, he said.																								Genlyte had an earnings before interest, tax and amortisation margin of 14.9 per cent in the 12-month period to September 2007.																								Philips said the acquisition would broaden its client base. This deal deepens our contacts to end users ... helping us speed up the market rollout of more energy-efficient lighting and the introduction of new lighting technologies, like solid state lighting, Theo van Deursen, chief executive of Philips Lighting, said in a statement.																								Louisville, Kentucky-based Genlyte makes lighting and lighting accessory products, with just under 90 per cent of its 2006 sales related to commercial and industrial applications. It had a turnover of about $1.6 billion over the 12 months period to September 2007.

				 Tata rolls out dream retirement option

London, Dec. 30 (PTI): Head of the Tata group Ratan Tata feels that after the Rs 1-lakh car is successfully launched, it will be an ideal time for him to retire from active business life, a media report said here.
																								In an ideal world, after the small car has been launched and is successful, that would be a nice time for me to exit, Tata told the Financial Times, which has named him among the three entrepreneurs making their presence felt around the world.
																								Tata Motors, the automotive arm of the Tata group, is scheduled to unveil the vehicle, touted as the worlds cheapest mass-produced car, on January 10 at an auto expo in New Delhi. 
																								Rival car makers are, however, not convinced about safety and emission standards of the car.
																								Reacting to this, Tata told the British newspaper that the car would be no more polluting than a motorcycle.
																								As we are not going to produce millions and millions of them, inundating the country, we will not be adding to the carbon footprint on a per-passenger basis, he added.
																								The report said there was a big gap between the cost of an average two-wheeler and entry-level cars such as the Maruti 800, which retails for about Rs 1.9 lakh, and Tata plans to fill it.
																								The only reason we did not make the Rs 1-lakh car a hybrid, for example, is that it could not have been priced at Rs 1 lakh, said Tata, who celebrated his 70th birthday on December 28. The newspaper said Tata would be one of the most visible faces of India in 2008.
																								When asked whether he has the fire in his belly for a further five years, Tata said, Not really. The other two named in the list of faces of enterprises include Marc Simoncini and Elon Musk.
																								Simoncini, 44, has founded, invested in and managed a succession of software and Internet companies during his colourful business career and runs Meetic, Europes largest online dating agency, it said.
																								The Internet cupid has sparked something of a sexual revolution across the continent. It has brought together thousands of lovelorn souls (resulting in an estimated 60,000 babies) and provided inspiration for Frances budding capitalists, it noted.
																								Musk is CEO, majority owner and head rocket designer at Spacex, an aerospace start-up in El Segundo, California, that by 2011 plans to be hauling astronauts to and from the international space station, Financial Times said. 
																								Global growth
																								The Tata group, which completed the Corus deal earlier this year, is set to make more multi-billion-dollar bets for expanding its global presence, a media report in New York said.
																								Early in the New Year, the conglomerates auto-making arm, Tata Motors, is likely to win its bid for Ford Motors premium Jaguar and Land Rover brands at a cost of more than $2 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported.
																								However, as the Tatas go ahead with the multi-billion dollar bets to become one of the first globally recognised Indian brands, the growing economic concerns worldwide are also increasing the risks for Indias most prolific purchaser of international companies, the report said.
																								The daily noted that the Tatas big bets are being made at risky times and there was increasing concern that a major slump could occur in developed markets that are the key markets for the Jaguar and the Land Rover.
																								About Tata Motors upcoming low-cost car, the report said that little was known about it, other than that it will have four seats, good gas mileage and a modern look.
																								The report quoted Tata Sons director and Indian Hotels vice-chairman R.K. Krishna Kumar as saying that, Companies involved in branded businesses cannot remain restricted to India. The only survivors will be those that have a dominant brand they have built or acquired.

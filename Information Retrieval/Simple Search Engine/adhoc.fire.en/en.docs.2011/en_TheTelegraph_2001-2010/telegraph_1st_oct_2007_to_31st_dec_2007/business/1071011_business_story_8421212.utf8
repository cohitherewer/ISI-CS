				 Bulls have a field day
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 10: Bulls continued to gorge on shares today and pushed the sensex within 300 points of the 19000-mark.																								Led by Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) and Infosys, the benchmark index closed 378 points higher at 18658, with foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and domestic funds going on a buying spree.																								In two days of frenzied trades, the index has zoomed a mind-boggling 1167 points. 																								The market is betting on second quarter results of corporate biggies such as Reliance and Infosys to be better than market expectations.																								FIIs have been infusing $800 million daily, on an average, in the past few sessions. They have bought over $3 billion worth of Indian shares so far this month and their net purchases for the year have surpassed $15 billion.																								Besides the political developments, analysts believe, market movements will be heavily influenced by the Infosys second-quarter results on Thursday and the Reliance Industries annual general meeting on Friday.																								The perception is that Infosys will not only announce better-than-expected results but also revise upwards its guidance for the rest of the year. 																								Reliance shares have also flared up in the past few sessions on expectations of a major announcement at the annual general meeting.																								IT stocks gained ahead of Infosys quarterly results. Infosys itself rose by Rs 76.55 to Rs 2,124.55, while TCS moved up by Rs 28.55 to Rs 1,124.95 and Wipro by Rs 13.85 to Rs 503.15. 																								But the star of the day was L amp;T. Shares of the engineering company rose by Rs 208.80, or 6.6 per cent, to close at Rs 3,372. The sensex opened at 18473.43, shot up to an intra-day high of 18703.67 before ending at 18658.25, a gain of 378.01 points. 																								Bharti Airtel, too, was in fine nick following a Reserve Bank notification allowing FIIs, NRIs and persons of Indian origin to purchase equity shares of the company under the portfolio investment scheme from the secondary market.																								The Bharti Airtel share ended at Rs 1,071.95, up 3 per cent, pitchforking promoter Sunil Mittal to the rupee-trillionaire club. Mittal joins Ambani brothers and DLFs K.P. Singh on this elite list.

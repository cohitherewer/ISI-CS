 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Identity crisis																								Mumbai, Oct. 2: Is a stock exchange an infrastructure company or a not-for-profit organisation? 																								The question lies at the root of a public interest litigation that Bombay High Court threw out recently with the question largely left unanswered. 																								The seemingly capricious question was raised by Krishnaraj Goswami, an advocate, through a PIL filed in June that named the Reserve Bank of India, the Union government, market regulator Sebi and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd as respondents. 																								Goswami had challenged a circular issued by the RBI in December 2006, which permitted foreign investment in infrastructure companies in the securities markets, namely, stock exchanges, depositories and clearing corporations. 																								Goswami contended that the RBI circular was unconstitutional, without jurisdiction and ultra vires of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act. He argued that the RBI had no powers under the act to issue such a circular. But more importantly, he raised the issue that the stock exchange is not an infrastructure company but a regulatory body and it cannot be allowed to function for profit. 																								One of the interesting aspects of the case was the legal quibble over the expression infrastructure companies and whether its meaning could be extended to cover stock exchanges. 																								The argument stemmed from the headline of the RBI circular that read: Foreign investment in infrastructure companies in securities markets  amendment to the foreign direct investment scheme. 																								Bombay High Courts Chief Justice Swatanter Kumar and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, who heard the case, said,We are unable to accept the contention raised on behalf of the petitioner that the expression infrastructure companies will have to be distinctly read from the expressions appearing immediately thereafter and that would result in its non-application to respondent No. 4 (NSE). 																								The court responded that Sebis circular clearly indicated that the government had decided to allow foreign investments in infrastructure companies in the securities companies, namely stock exchanges, depositories and clearing corporations. 																								It is clear that there could be no restriction in the application of the circular to the NSE, the court said. 																								But it still left the basic question  whether a bourse was an infrastructure company or a not-for-profit organisation  open-ended. 																								Caps and riders 																								The RBI circular, which flowed from an executive decision taken by the government in December last year, set a 49 per cent cap on foreign investment in the bourses and depositories with sub-caps of 26 per cent for foreign direct investment (FDI) and 23 per cent for foreign institutional investment. 																								There were two riders: FDI would be allowed with specific prior approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and foreign portfolio investment would be permitted through purchases in the secondary market. 																								The circular was issued under sections 10(4) and 11(1) of FEMA. 																								While formulating its policy on allowing foreign investment in stock exchanges and depositories, the government had tacked on two more conditions. First, the FIIs would not get representation on the board of directors of these institutions and, second, no foreign investor would hold more than 5 per cent of the equity in these companies. 																								Crank or front? 																								It might be tempting to dismiss Goswami as some sort of a crank except that the PIL was filed after the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the Delhi Stock Exchange have started bringing foreign investors on board after completing a process of demutualisation. 																								The bourses have been transformed from a closed club of stockbrokers into corporate entities with a well-defined shareholding structure. 																								In January, soon after the RBI circular was issued, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and three other institutional investors  General Atlantic, SAIF Partners (a subsidiary of Japans Softbank) and Goldman Sachs  picked up 5 per cent each in the NSE. NYSE had paid $115 million for the stake while the others paid slightly more. 																								The spokesperson for BSE said, According to the demutualisation guidelines, the maximum permissible foreign equity stake in BSE is 26 per cent. Deutsche Boerse and the Singapore Stock Exchange own 5 per cent of stake each. 																								Four other international investors have a 4 per cent stake each. We have, thus, reached the maximum permissible limit for foreign investment. 																								However, the foreign stake can go all the way up to 49 per cent once the bourses list on the exchanges and secondary market purchases begin. There are no indications yet that any of the bourses will do so.

				 SBI chief favours golden share
				 	 Bhatt: Growth tips																								New Delhi, Oct. 7 (PTI): The government should consider having a golden share to retain control over public sector banks, while allowing them to raise capital, according to the chairman of the State Bank of India, .P. Bhatt.																								A golden share is a nominal share that outvotes all other shares. It is often held by a government in a public sector entiy that is undergoing privatisation.																								Public sector banks can lose out to foreign or private banks in meeting fast-growing capital needs of companies  particularly for mergers and acquisitions  unless nationalised banks are equipped to augment their capital, Bhatt said.																								If banks have to raise capital through an equity issue in situations where the government shareholding cannot fall below 51 per cent, an option is for the government to participate in the issue to keep its stake constant.																								So either they (government) do that, or if they cannot, then there can be some concept of golden shares or non-voting shares or some other capital structure plan where they will have ownership control, Bhatt said.																								On the SBIs capital requirement and the mode through which the bank proposes to raise it, Bhatt said, It is difficult to say anything at this time ... It could be at least Rs 10,000 crore or Rs 20,000 crore if we can get it.																								On whether the bank would go for equity expansion or preferential shares to raise the capital and what the time frame would be, Bhatt said the government was considering the issue of the mode of raising capital and a decision would be taken soon. 																								I know that the government is applying itself to this issue for sometime. I have a feeling that it will decide very soon, he said.																								Asked whether the dilution of equity to the extent where the government holding is above 51 per cent will be enough, Bhatt said even a per cent or two will mean a lot of capital for the bank as our market capitalisation is well above Rs 100,000 crore. The question is how much and how soon, so there is no fear.																								The bank could also leverage from the increased capital, Bhatt said, adding that further funds could be raised from the Tier II capital (debt market).

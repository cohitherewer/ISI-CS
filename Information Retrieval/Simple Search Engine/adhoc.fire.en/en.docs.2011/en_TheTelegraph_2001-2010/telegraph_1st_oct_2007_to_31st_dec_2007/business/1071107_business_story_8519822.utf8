				 Rail-NTPC pact for Bihar power plant
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Charged up																								New Delhi, Nov. 6: Indian Railways has joined hands with the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) to set up a 1,000MW captive power plant at Nabinagar in Bihar. The joint venture, to be set up with an investment of Rs 1,605 crore, will be called Bharatiya Rail Bijlee Company Ltd.																								The agreement was signed in the presence of railway minister Lalu Prasad and power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde at the Rail Bhawan today. NTPC will have a 74 per cent stake in the venture, while the railways will hold the rest. 																								Once the investment is approved, which is likely by December, work will begin on the plant, which is expected to be operational within two-and-a-half years. 																								This venture can help the railways save Rs 400-600 crore annually on power purchase from state electricity boards.																								Most of the electricity generated at the Nabinagar plant will be used for the 164 traction substations in the east and the west.																								Power generated from this plant will cost Rs 2.13 per mega watt compared with the usual Rs 4.28, Shinde said. 																								Lalu Prasad said the railways was spending about Rs 5,700 crore per year to buy more than 13,000 million units of electricity for traction and non-traction use. He said nearly 18,000km of the 63,000km rail network have electricity connection.																								In view of the high tariff charged by state electricity boards, the Union cabinet had approved Indian Railways proposal to directly tap central generating agencies for supply from the 15 per cent unallocated central share of power.																								The electricity generated in this plant will be used to run trains in Bihar, Jharkhand, Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. 																								The railways will use 90 per cent of the generated power. Lalu Prasad said the company would provide the remaining 10 per cent power to Bihar.

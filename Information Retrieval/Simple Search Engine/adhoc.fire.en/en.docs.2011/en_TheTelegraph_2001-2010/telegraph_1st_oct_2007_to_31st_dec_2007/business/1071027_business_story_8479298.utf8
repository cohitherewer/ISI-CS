				 Sebi message lifts market sentiment
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 26: The sensex roared again  and scaled a new high at 19276.45 points as the markets fears of a large-scale selloff by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) disappeared after Sebis clarity on participatory notes (P-Notes).																								The barometer of the markets sentiment dipped slightly at the close to 19243.17, reflecting a gain of 472.28 points.																								A highlight of the days trading was the spike in L amp;T which now has the third largest weightage in the sensex after Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank.																								L amp;T shares surged 12 per cent, or by Rs 420.40, to close at an all-time high of Rs 3,876.80 after it reported a 73 per cent increase in second quarter profits at Rs 348 crore. Its revenues rose 47 per cent, bolstered by a strong order book.																								Brokers said the market welcomed Sebis decision to foster greater transparency on fund flows into the country. The move to allow sub-accounts of FIIs to register was also seen as a good sign.																								Some FIIs, however, have expressed the apprehension that near-term flows into the domestic stock markets could recede on account of Sebis move to put fetters on issuers of P-notes. 																								Citigroup said in a report today that the measures could be negative for near-term flows, though it admitted that Sebis action would be beneficial for the equity markets in the long run.																								The stock markets have largely liked Sebis decisions. It is now focussing on fundamentals. Though there could be a correction, the overall sentiment is positive, said an analyst.																								Market observers said the sensex began on a cautious note and dipped in early morning trades as investors turned circumspect as they waited for the market to digest Sebis measures. After opening at 18823.66 and touching a days low of 18629.53, the benchmark index bounced back and then maintained the momentum. 																								Heavyweights such as Reliance Industries also saw brisk activity. Brokers added that bank shares were also active on the hope that the Reserve Bank of India would not raise key policy rates at its monetary policy review on Tuesday. Both the State Bank of India and ICICI Bank hit new highs.																								Meanwhile, the rupee overcame some early pangs to end stronger at 39.45 per dollar.																								The local currency fluctuated in a range of 39.43 and 39.63 during the day after opening weak at 39.62 per dollar. Analysts are bullish in their outlook for the Indian currency, pointing out that it will continue to rise against the dollar as greenbacks pour into the financial system.

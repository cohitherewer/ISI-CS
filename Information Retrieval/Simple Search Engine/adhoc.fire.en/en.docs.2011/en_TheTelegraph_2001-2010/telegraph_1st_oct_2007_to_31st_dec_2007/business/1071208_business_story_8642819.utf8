																								Calcutta, Dec. 7: Representatives of Lockheed Martin Corporations 55 business units will meet in Washington DC next week to discuss their Indian operations.
																								The US-based company is also hopeful that the first-ever Indo-US defence deal, valued at $1 billion, will be sealed by the end of this fiscal. The governments of the US and India are expected to sign a contract by March 2008 for six C130J Hercules transport cargo aircraft for the Indian Air Force. There will be an option to buy six more such planes.
																								We expect the deal to close by the end of this fiscal. We are basically a defence company, but will also look at non-weapon areas to expand in India, said Royce L. Caplinger, managing director of Lockheed Martin India. He was speaking on the sidelines of the second phase of the Lockheed Martin India Innovation Growth Programme in the city.
																								Caplinger said that besides the C130J deal, Lockheed Martin would also submit a proposal to the Indian Air Forces tender for 126 fighter jets by March 2008. It has positioned F-16 as one of the top contenders for the $10-billion offer.
																								The company is competing with Russian, Swedish and French firms to win the order. 
																								According to reports, however, the Pentagon is divided over sharing advanced radar know-how with India.
																								The detailed technical offer will be submitted to the ministry by March 3.
																								The company said it was open to providing all kinds of support to the Indian Air Force, including setting up maintenance hubs, if they got the order.

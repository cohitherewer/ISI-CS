 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jeh Wadia, MD of GoAir, with Miranda Mills, vice-president (sales) of Airbus India, in New Delhi on Thursday. Picture by Prem Singh																								New Delhi, Oct. 4: GoAir is planning to sell a 26 per cent stake to private financial investors.																								GoAir managing director Jeh Wadia said, The airline is in negotiations with some shortlisted investors and expects to close the deal in a few months.																								The extent of divestment will depend on the quality of the offers, he said. 																								The offers on the table are difficult to ignore, though the airline will look for partners who bring in more than just cash, said Wadia.																								Earlier, there were media reports about South-based Paramount Airways interest in acquiring GoAir. But this was later denied.																								The low-cost airline also plans to enter the capital markets with an initial public offering by March 2009. 																								Wadia said, We want to grow slowly and not become aggressive.																								He added, Only when the policy, infrastructure and taxes improve in another one to three years, will our returns be better. Till then we want to be conservative in our expansion plans.																								The airline hopes to break even by the end of 2007-08.																								GoAir will add two new aircraft in October and November. They are part of a Rs 4,800-crore order placed with Airbus for 20 aircraft. 																								The airline will also focus on consolidating its network.

				 Bank scrips fuel rally
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 30: A rally in the Asian markets, sparked by hopes of an US Fed rate cut, coupled with strong gains in key stocks today saw the sensex rise almost 360 points. 																								Bank shares were leaders today as data on the countrys GDP figures led to hopes that interest rates could be headed downwards in the months to come. 																								Brokers said apart from positive cues from other bourses, there was buying interest as today was the first day after the rollover of derivatives contracts.																								In Asia, barring Shanghai composite, which ended 2.63 per cent lower, other indices such as Hang Seng, Nikkei, Strait Times and Taiwan ended with strong gains.																								Unlike recent sessions, strong gains recorded early in the morning did not fizzle out towards the second half. The markets were strong throughout the day, an analyst said. 																								However, analysts believe that stock markets could face volatility in the days ahead. A major concern continues to be the behaviour of foreign institutional investors who have been net sellers for the past few sessions.																								ICICI Bank gained 1.93 per cent to Rs 1,184.65. The State Bank of India (SBI) also ended firm at Rs 2,300.30, a rise of 1.34 per cent or Rs 30.50 over its last close. 																								The BSE sensex opened at 19,136.12 and hit a high of 19,424.99 before it closed at 19,363.19, a rise of 359.93 points over the last finish.

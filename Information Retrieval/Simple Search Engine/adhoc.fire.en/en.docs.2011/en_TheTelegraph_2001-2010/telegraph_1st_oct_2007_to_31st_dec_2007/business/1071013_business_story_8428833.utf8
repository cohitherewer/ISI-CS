				 Healthy rise in Exide net

Ramanathan, managing director and CEO of Exide Industries. 																								The cost of raw material consumption in the quarter increased to Rs 497.96 crore compared with Rs 289.68 crore. Ramanathan said a long-term solution to high costs was to depend less on imported lead.

The total income of the group was Rs 211.49 crore in the quarter, against Rs 198.92 crore for the same quarter in the previous fiscal.

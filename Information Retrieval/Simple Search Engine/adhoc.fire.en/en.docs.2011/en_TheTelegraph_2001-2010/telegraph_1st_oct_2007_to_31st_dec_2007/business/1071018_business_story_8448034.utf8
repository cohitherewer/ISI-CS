				 Rupee mimics stock trend
 OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES				 	 CHAIN REACTION																								Mumbai, Oct. 17: Mirroring stock trends, the rupee today tumbled against the dollar in early trades before recovering to end at 39.55, a loss of 20 paise from yesterday.																								Apprehensions over a pull-out by foreign institutional investors influenced sentiments. In volatile trade, the rupee moved in the range of 39.98 and 39.54, after the initial plunge to 39.98.																								Analysts said the rupee could be under pressure in the immediate term on account of worries over FIIs limiting their exposure to the country.																								If there is a further fall, the rupee could come under pressure. Though it will not hit the Rs 40-mark immediately, breaching that level is not improbable, an analyst said.																								The Indian currency has appreciated 12.5 per cent against the dollar this year, hitting a high of 39.27 on October 11. The rupee also fell vis-a-vis the pound, euro and yen today.																								Crude sizzles																								Oil marched to a new peak of $89 a barrel on Wednesday as investors fretted over possible military action in northern Iraq and a potential supply crunch this winter.																								US crude entered a seventh day of gains, soaring $1.39 to trade at $89 before pulling back to $88.22 by 1551 GMT  a 61 cent rise. London Brent crude rose 25 cents to $83.80.																								The surge has taken prices near their $90.46 inflation-adjusted peak of 1980.																								The impact of the geopolitical risk was magnified by concerns that Opecs 500,000 barrels per day output rise may be too little too late to maintain healthy supplies through the winter.

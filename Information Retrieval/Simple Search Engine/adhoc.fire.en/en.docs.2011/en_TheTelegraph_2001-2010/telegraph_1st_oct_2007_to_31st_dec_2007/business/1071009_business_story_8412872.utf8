				 DoT disconnects spectrum trade
 JAYATI GHOSE				 	 Strict rules																								New Delhi, Oct. 8: The department of telecom (DoT) will not allow spectrum trading. The move will disappoint those planning to make a fast buck by selling radiowaves.																								DoT officials said, The spectrum policy, which is under consideration, will not allow trading of radio waves. Allocation will be through the auction route or based upon eligibility and release of spectrum by the defence forces.																								Some telecom experts have said the government should allow spectrum trading  phone companies with spare spectrum should be allowed to sell their surplus to those who are hard-pressed to service their customer base  as a means to get around spectrum crunch.																								Spectrum trading can be implemented in conjunction with any of these primary assignment mechanisms  such as auction or first come, first served basis  to increase the economic efficiency of the assignment, feel analysts at Analysys, a UK-based telecom consultancy firm.																								Countries such as New Zealand, the US, Australia and Singapore allow spectrum trading. 																								In 2004, Sydney found its communication network under tremendous pressure due to the increased number of people and heightened telecom activity during the Olympic games. The city was able to meet the sudden spike in traffic through spectrum trading. 																								In the US, a telecom operator is believed to have launched his services solely on the basis of spectrum bought in the secondary market from other operators.																								However, Prashant Singal, telecom analyst with Ernst and Young, feels such a model is not applicable in a developing nation such as India.																								If telecom operators are permitted to trade in radiowaves, they might shift from providing telecom services to only dealing in spectrum, creating greater shortage of the scarce resource, said Singal. Such a situation would also lead to hoarding and artificial pricing of the resource, making it more expensive, he added.																								Some experts feel the recent scramble for telecom licences is aimed at making a quick buck by selling the same to overseas players at a hefty premium.																								However, Trai chairman Nripendra Misra said that kind of speculative trading would not be allowed.																								Trai has make it clear that if an operator gets a new licence, it will have to fulfil rollout obligations and firms cannot acquire or merge with another firm in the next three to four years of acquiring a telecom licence, said Misra.

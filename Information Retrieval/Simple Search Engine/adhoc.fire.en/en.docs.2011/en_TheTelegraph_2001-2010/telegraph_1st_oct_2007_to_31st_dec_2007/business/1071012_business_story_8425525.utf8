				 Cash hunt takes DLF abroad
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 11: Real estate developer DLF Ltd plans to borrow $1.5 billion overseas to fund new projects and acquisitions. It plans to raise the money in the next 30 days.																								Half of the money raised will be spent on buying shares in DLF Offices Trust, a Singapore-based entity. 																								The remaining $750 million will be spent on buying land and properties in India and abroad. DLF is on an expansion spree and is involved in some 170 projects.																								To further the business plan of DLF, including investment in the forthcoming IPO of DLF Offices Trust, the board has given us an approval to raise a loan of up to $1.5 billion through an overseas subsidiary, senior vice-president Saurabh Chawla said.																								The maiden offer of DLF Offices Trust will be launched in Singapore in January next year and will be open to the public.																								Stocks of DLF Offices Trust will be traded on the Singapore Stock Exchange. DLF will participate in the IPO and invest up to $750 million.																								DLF Assets is being converted into DLF Offices. This firm is owned by K.P. Singhs family, but is not a part of DLF Ltd. 																								A DLF spokesperson said, The capital being raised will be mainly used to fund overseas transactions, acquisitions as well as development projects. If the overseas company has an Indian arm, the capital can be brought to India.																								On why Singapore was chosen for the IPO, the spokesperson said, We did a study and found that the Singapore market best suited our sort of listing. 																								Singapore has a good legal structure and is a preferred choice for many foreign institutional funds. It has a friendly regulatory environment for foreigners. We thought an IPO in Singapore will be better for DLF Assets.																								According to banking sources, Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers have been appointed as advisers to the issue.

				 Free trade pact with Europe awaits big push
				 	 EU president Jose Socrates (left) and European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso (right) with China Premier Wen Jiabao in Beijing on Wednesday. (AFP)																								Brussels, Nov. 28 (AFP): EU and Indian leaders will seek to push forward plans for a free trade zone, at a summit in New Delhi on Friday, and further boost a burgeoning relationship between the regional powers.																								Also high on the agenda when European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, who is also EU president, meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other Indian leaders will be the problems in neighbouring Pakistan and Afghanistan.																								The 8th EU-India summit comes at a symbolic time according to an EU spokesman in Brussels, referring to 60 years of Indias Independence, 50 years since the EUs founding Rome treaty and 45 years since the start of bilateral diplomatic relations.																								EU-India trade has come a long way since those political landmarks.																								European Commission delegation chief Daniele Smadja told a news conference in New Delhi on Monday that it was seeking fast agreement on the free trade deal.																								We are negotiating a free trade agreement and talks are progressing very well. We hope during this summit to bring impetus to these negotiations, added Portuguese ambassador Luis Filipe Castro Mendes.																								EU foreign ministers gave the green light in April for the talks to start with India. But neither side was predicting when an agreement would be struck.																								An official at Indias Brussels embassy echoed that bilateral relations were strong but have not reached their full potential.																								Wed like a trade deal at this summit, or the next one, as soon as it is possible, he said.																								The EU is already Indias largest trading partner, and a major source of investment. Last year the 27 EU nations invested 1.6 billion euros in India.																								India, with its 1.1 billion people and fast-growing middle class, represents a huge market for EU companies.																								The European Union is increasingly looking towards the massive growth potential of Asian markets.																								European leaders will use meetings this week in Beijing, including an EU-China summit today, to pile fresh pressure on Chinese authorities over the Asian economic giants booming exports and state-controlled exchange rate.																								At the Delhi summit the EU and Indian leaders will also discuss climate change and environmental issues.

				 Coal mine energiser for CESC ready
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 23: CESC is close to getting a long-awaited captive coal mine for its power plants in Haldia and Jharkhand.																								Sources said the company would be allotted a coal block at Mahuagiri in Jharkhand. The block will cater to both the Haldia and Jharkhand units.																								CESC has been lobbying for the captive block for almost two years.																								It is eyeing coal reserves of 700 million tonnes for its various projects. 																								The flagship company of Calcutta-based RPG Enterprises plans to set up a 2,000MW plant in Jharkhand. It has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Jharkhand government for the project.																								CESC has acquired around 300 acres for the first phase of the Haldia project. It has sounded out suppliers for the plant. It was waiting for the captive coal block before going ahead with the project.																								According to industry thumbrule, a coal reserve of 140MT is required to run a 1,000MW power plant for 30 years  the period for which mining leases are generally offered.																								CESC officials, however, declined to comment. We are yet to hear anything from the Centre, he said. 																								The combined capacity of the Haldia and Jharkhand plants is 1,600MW. The two projects will involve an investment of Rs 6,000 crore in the initial phase.																								Last week, the company decided to raise $150 million, or Rs 600 crore, through a share sale to finance the projects.																								At present, it sources 50 per cent of its coal requirements from captive blocks at Ranigunj. The rest is secured through established coal linkages.																								CESCs requirement will rise further with the proposed 250MW unit in Budge Budge.																								The company which supplies power in Calcutta and Howrah  is banking on the Haldia project to meet the rising demand in the two cities.																								However, the Haldia plant will have to depend on Jharkhand for coal as there are no open cast mines in Bengal. 																								Underground mining increases the cost of operation, making a power plant unviable.																								It takes 3 to 4 years to set up a plant once mining operations start. 																								CESC has to set up the necessary infrastructure to carry the coal from the pithead to Haldia. The company has also signed an MoU with the Orissa government for a 1,000 MW plant.

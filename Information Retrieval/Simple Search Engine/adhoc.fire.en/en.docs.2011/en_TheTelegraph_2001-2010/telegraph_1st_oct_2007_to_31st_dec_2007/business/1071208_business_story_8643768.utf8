				 Max bets big on insurance

 OUR CORRESPONDENT, 
																								Mumbai, Dec. 7: Max India will infuse over Rs 1,950 crore in its insurance joint venture, Max New York Life, over the next three years to strengthen its office network and distribution strength.
																								The higher level of capitalisation will see Max New York Life adding around 90-100 offices every year going forward and increasing its distribution strength to over 200,000 agents in the next four to five years, Max India chairman Analjit Singh said.
																								Max New York Life Insurance Company is a joint venture between Max India and US insurer New York Life, with the indian firm holding a 74 per cent stake.
																								The total investment into Max New York Life by both the shareholders would be in excess of Rs 2,600 crore by 2010-11. Max India will contribute close to Rs 1,950 crore. Of this, it has already infused around Rs 600 crore.
																								Encouraged by impressive performance of the life insurance business, the shareholders have decided to substantially increase the peak capital commitment for the venture, Singh added.
																								The enhanced capital commitment would allow the venture to support its continuing rapid growth, Singh added. 
																								Max India recently raised Rs 1,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement issue, which would largely get invested into the insurance subsidiary.
																								The insurance firm has 175 offices in 122 locations and more than 28,500 agent advisers, 17 bancassurance relationships, 14 corporate agents and around 450 people direct sales team. 
																								The life insurer recorded a total premium income of about Rs 1,500 crore during 2006-07, which was nearly double compared with a year ago. 
																								The company deployed a capital of about Rs 557 crore during the year ended March 2006.

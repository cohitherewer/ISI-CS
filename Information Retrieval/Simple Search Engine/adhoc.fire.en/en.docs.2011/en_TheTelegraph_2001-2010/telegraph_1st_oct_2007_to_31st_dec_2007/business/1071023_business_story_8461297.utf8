 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA																								Calcutta, Oct. 22: Hyundai Motor India Ltd will launch its compact car i10, code named Pa, in the country on November 1.																								The car will be available in 10 colours. It will have a sun roof, the first for a compact car. The i10 is expected to be priced between Rs 3.7 lakh and Rs 3.9 lakh.																								India is set to be the global manufacturing hub for the compact car.																								The Korean auto firm plans to more than double its export volumes from India in the next two years.																								Hyundai aims to export one lakh units this fiscal and expects to increase this to 2.5 lakh units in the next two years.																								Hyundai cars comprise about 70 per cent of Indias auto exports.																								Apart from the Santro, plans are afoot to bring models such as the Getz and the Accent under the export fold as the manufacturing capacity increases.																								The companys new plant in Chennai with a capacity of three lakh units is expected to go on stream by October this year. 																								This will take Hyundais total capacity to six lakh units.																								It is also being speculated that a Santro variant may be in the offing. The company had launched the Santro Xing in 2003. 																								Company officials said it had already slashed prices of the Santro. However, industry sources said a variant with fewer features and a price cut of Rs 70,000 or above might be on the cards.																								Hyundai sells around 18,000 units per month with Santro accounting for 13,000 to 14,000 units.																								The eastern region contributes 9 per cent to the auto majors sales in the country. This is expected to rise to 15 per cent in the next three years.

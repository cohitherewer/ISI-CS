				 Vishal Retail in cash chase
 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: Vishal Retail is planning to raise around Rs 200-500 crore through a qualified institutional buyer (QIB) issue or a follow-on offer.																								Ritesh Rathi, chief operating officer of Vishal Retail, told The Telegraph, We have to decide between a QIB issue and a follow-on offer to raise the money for our expansion programme.																								Vishal has 70 retail outlets in 49 cities and plans to open 40 to 45 more outlets in smaller cities and towns by next year.																								Vishal, which started as a one-store enterprise in 1986 in Calcutta, sells apparel (for both men and women), home furnishings, kitchenware, appliances, consumer durables, crockeries, toys and games. The company posted a sales turnover of Rs 603 crore last year. 																								We are planning to clock a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore this year, Rathi said. He said Vishal would increase its retail space in 2008 by a million square feet.																								The proposed fund-raising plan comes on top of the initial public offering of 47,82,609 shares made earlier this year. 																								The debt-equity ratio of the company is 2:1 and analysts said a new equity offer would help reduce this.																								At present, 60 per cent of Vishals revenue comes from apparel sales, 20 per cent from FMCG and 20 per cent from general merchandise. To increase its sales from existing outlets, Vishal wants to start selling liquor, pharmaceuticals, consumer durables and jewellery.																								We are planning to go to smaller cities and towns very soon. We are exploring real estate options for that, Rathi added.																								Vishal is planning to set up specialty as well as convenience stores along with its hyper and super markets. The specialty stores will have appliances as well as apparel and the convenience stores will have groceries. 																								However, Rathi said Vishal had no plans to tie up with any foreign brands for its growth. Rathi said, The middle income segment is very big and we intend to cash in on it. At a later date, when we move to the premium segment we will still be sourcing most products locally.

				 Input cost squeezes Lever profit
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 31: The net profit of Hindustan Unilever fell 21.6 per cent in the third quarter to Rs 408.06 crore from Rs 520.74 crore a year ago.																								High raw material prices and the lock-out at its Assam unit have hit profit. Besides, profits were higher in the previous year because of a stake sale in Tata Chemicals that was recorded as exceptional income in Hindustan Unilevers books. 																								Total sales, however, grew 9.7 per cent on the back of a good show by the FMCG division which grew 10.8 per cent.																								In the home and personal care business, the company reported a growth of 9.5 per cent, with soaps and detergents growing 13 per cent.																								Sales in the personal products segment, particularly in skin and toothpaste categories, were hit by the seven-week shutdown of the Assam plant, which is now open.																								D. Sundaram, director  finance, Hindustan Unilever, said at the operating level the company fared well, though net profits fell because of the exceptional income.																								He said urban and rural markets displayed good growth and the company was optimistic of its prospects in villages because of the good monsoon. Higher input costs, Sundaram said, were a result of rising vegetable oil and crude oil prices. The surge in crude prices had raised costs of many inputs.																								Hindustan Unilever chairman Harish Manwani said, We have broadly sustained our market shares across categories. The one-off impact arising from closure of the Assam factory is behind us, and we expect personal products to regain its growth momentum. Material cost inflation remains a concern and we manage this through aggressive cost effectiveness and judicious price increases.																								The board of the company declared a platinum jubilee dividend of Rs 3 per share today. However, the shares of the company crashed by over 5 per cent to Rs 207.60 because of the drop in net profit.																								R-Com show																								Reliance Communications (R-Com) today posted an 86 per cent increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs 1,304.5 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2007. 																								The companys total income during the quarter grew 29.87 per cent and stood at Rs 4,578.5 crore, R-Com said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.																								It also reported a 73.75 per cent jump in its standalone profit after tax at Rs 801 crore, while the total income grew to Rs 3,329.2 crore.

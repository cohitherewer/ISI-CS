				 Nokia initiative for SHGs
 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA 																								Calcutta, Oct. 14: Nokia is churning out cellular entrepreneurs in rural regions with its Village Phone Direct plan.																								Phone kits are offered to members of self-help groups (SHGs) who earn money by charging villagers for calls.																								Devinder Kishore, marketing director of Nokia India, said, We are piloting this model in Andhra Pradesh and Haryana. The handsets have special features and come with booster antenna for areas that are over 20 kilometres or more from the nearest coverage tower.																								Launched in Bangladesh with Grameen Foundation, the initiative is also being piloted in Pakistan, Angola in South Africa and Haiti in Central America. 																								Besides Bangladesh, the plan is operational in the African countries of Rwanda and Uganda. The kit is made up of a Nokia handset, a SIM card loaded with prepaid airtime, an external antenna set (including a booster antenna, a coupler, and a cable) and marketing materials. 																								Self-help group members can even take a loan, to be repaid with proceeds from the business. 																								In Uganda and Rwanda, the interest on the loan is not more than 4 per cent, with the duration being nine months. Usually the loans are paid in six months.																								Rural connectivity took a big leap with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited bagging the bulk (80 per cent) of the Department of Telecoms Rs 2,500-crore rural mobile telephony project.

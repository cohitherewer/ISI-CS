				 Rs 100-cr subsidy to enliven tea
 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA				 	 Ramesh: Cash plan																								Guwahati, Nov. 22: The Union commerce ministry has announced a Rs 100-crore subsidy to raise orthodox tea production to 140 million kg in the next 5-7 years from 80 million kg at present.																								Union minister of state for commerce and industry Jairam Ramesh announced the package at the India International Tea Convention in Guwahati today.																								As traditional CTC markets such as Russia and West Asia are shifting towards orthodox production, it is imperative that we export what other countries want and not what we produce, said Ramesh. 																								The Indian tea industry has been lackadaisical in promoting its wares. Now is the right time to reorient with the market and pick up where we had left in orthodox tea production, he added.																								Around 500 delegates from India and across the world are attending the convention.																								The presence of representatives from China, Kenya and Sri Lanka  they are major producing countries along with India  has provided an opportunity to set up a global body of producers.																								Five such conventions in 30 years cut a sorry figure for the Indian tea industry. I hope this will become an event of prime importance in the international tea calendar every two years, Ramesh said.																								Discussions will be held on technology, research and maximum residue levels in pesticides. A common platform exists only in the inter governmental group under the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, said Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee.																								Ramesh, who met the chairman of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan, said he hoped that in the next five years exports to Pakistan would rise to 30 million kg from 10 million kg now as the route through the Wagah border for transporting tea seemed a possibility.																								The Indian tea industry represents a turnover of some Rs 6,500 crore at the farm level. The industry has a direct employment base of 1.25 million and another 1.2 million are dependents. However, the Plantation Labour Act enacted in 1951 needs to be reviewed in the present context, said Aditya Khaitan, chairman of the Consultative Committee of Plantation Associations.																								The Centre is also setting up a Rs 16-crore tea engineering centre at IIT Kharagpur.

				 Flat panel TVs set to take over prime time
 GARIMA SINGH NEOGY																								New Delhi, Nov. 11: Flat panel televisions, comprising plasma and LCD variants, are edging their way to the top of the colour TV market.																								While television manufacturers such as LG and Sony expect LCD and plasma models to take over colour televisions by 2010, Korean major Samsung said it would take another five years for this revolution to happen. 																								In two to three years, we may witness a sales war between the conventional colour and flat panel televisions. In a few years, history will repeat itself  like the time when colour televisions took over their black and white counterparts, said Amitabh Tiwari, business group head (consumer electronics), LG Electronics India. 																								Analysts said they expected prices of flat panel TVs to be down by 30-40 per cent over the next few years. 																								Colour TV sales stand at 10 million units per annum. About 4 lakh units of flat panel displays are expected to be sold this year against two lakh units in 2006.																								In the flat panel segment, LCD television contributes 80 per cent to overall sales while the plasma model makes up for the rest. 																								Both plasma and LCD panels have flat screens. However, there is a difference. Plasma screens use a matrix of tiny gas plasma cells charged by electrical voltages to create a picture. 																								An LCD or liquid crystal display screen is made up of liquid crystals sandwiched between two glass plates. 																								Masaru Tamagawa, managing director of Sony India, said the company was focusing on LCD televisions, which are cheaper compared with plasma, to push its sales during the festival season. Speaking at a recent conference, he said colour television sales have dipped, while the LCD market is soaring.																								While the LCD market continues to grow at a rapid pace, colour TV sales are moving at a slower rate. With larger screen sizes and competitive pricing adding to the growth, LCD prices on an average have witnessed a decrease by 20-30 per cent. Colour TVs, however, reported a decline of 5-10 per cent, said Yoshiki Yamanokuchi, division head (display) of Sony India.																								Pradeep Tognatta, director (consumer electronics) at Samsung India, said, The current gap between colour TV and flat panel display is sizeable. It will take another four to five years for the gap to narrow.																								Samsung India, which enjoys a 43 per cent share in the flat panel segment, plans to grab 50 per cent of the market by the end of December, said Tognatta.																								LG, too, is targeting a market share of 40 per cent by 2010 in the LCD segment, said Tiwari. LG sells 6,300 units of LCD sets every month and 6,000 units of plasma annually.

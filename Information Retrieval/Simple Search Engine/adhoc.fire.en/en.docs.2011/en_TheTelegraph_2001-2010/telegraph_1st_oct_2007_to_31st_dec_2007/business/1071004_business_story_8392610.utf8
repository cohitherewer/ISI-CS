 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 Flight plan: Jeffery Smisek (left), president of Continental Airlines, with Laurent Recoura (centre), senior director (India), and Jim Summer Ford, vice-president of Europe and West Asia operations, in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Oct. 3: New York-based Continental Airlines has started non-stop flights between Mumbai and New York from October 2. 																								Delta Airlines and Air India already fly from Mumbai to New Yorks John F Kennedy Airport. But Continental is the only airline to connect Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai to Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. 																								Continental had started the Delhi-New York non-stop service in 2005. 																								Mumbai is the 30th city in Continentals trans-Atlantic network.																								Jeffery Smisek, president of Continental Airlines, said: We are proud to expand our network to Indias business capital. We were the first airline to launch a scheduled non-stop service between Delhi and New York in 2005.																								The company said a 285-seat Boeing-777 aircraft would operate the flights, carrying 235 passengers in economy class, with a minimum fare of Rs 36,000 plus taxes. 																								According to a leading travel agent, the minimum fare for a return flight will be around Rs 49,000 (including all applicable taxes) for a Mumbai-New York non-stop flight by Continental. 																								Continentals minimum fare is slightly higher than Deltas Rs 47,960. State-owned Air Indias fare is the highest, at Rs 51,700. 																								The flights will initially take off four times a week (Monday, Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday) at 11:45 pm from Mumbai. 																								There will be daily services from October 28. 																								Jet Airways also flies from Mumbai to New York via Brussels, with a minimum economy fare of Rs. 48,000. 																								The industry will witness a huge fare war in the coming days with Vijay Mallyas Kingfisher Airlines planning to start India-US flights from next year.

				 LIC turns health freak
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Singh: Upbeat																								Mumbai, Oct. 5: The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) will launch its first health insurance product next month. 																								The product will be a hospital cash product where a lump sum is paid to the insured on detection of a critical illness or during hospitalisation. In most health insurance products, the costs incurred by the insured are reimbursed later based on hospital bills. 																								The LICs health plan is a family floater scheme covering four members of a family with a single sum assured.																								The LIC will be filing details of the product with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority by the end of this month. 																								It plans to launch the product any time next month after receiving an approval from the regulator, executive director D.D. Singh said. 																								The product will provide a long-term cover, spread over 10 years and above, and will be priced on an annualised basis. Premium for the product will increase with the age of the insured.																								The LIC has set up a separate company in Hyderabad, comprising 30 people, to manage its health insurance business.																								Singh said the insurance plan would also cover pre-existing diseases with some strings attached.																								Part of the premium paid will be routed to a savings account as in unit-linked insurance products. The accumulated premium in this savings account will be returned to the policyholder as cash benefit on maturity of the plan.																								The company has tied up with eight third party administrators to process claims, he said.																								Besides, it has tied up with Syndicate Bank, Axis Bank and Bank of America for claims payout, Singh added.																								The corporation has selected Munich Re as the reinsurer for health products. The German company will decide the structure of LICs health products and premium and assess the risk parameters that will come with the insurance cover.																								The corporation will market the health plan through banks and its 10 lakh agents.

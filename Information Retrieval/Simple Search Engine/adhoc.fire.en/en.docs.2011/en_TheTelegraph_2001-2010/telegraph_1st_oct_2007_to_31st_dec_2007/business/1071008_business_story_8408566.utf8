 ANIRUDH LASKAR				 	 HOPE FOR THE BEST																								Mumbai, Oct. 7: Private life insurers are chomping on the bit and pressing the regulator to relax investment conditions that will enable them to crank up returns for policyholders.																								Current regulations are stacked against private insurers: they are allowed to invest only up to 35 per cent of the corpus under their traditional policies such as endowment and annuity plans and that too in the equity of listed companies.																								State-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) doesnt face the same investment restrictions because it was formed under a different statute.																								For starters, the private insurers want the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to let them invest in the equity of unlisted companies. 																								They reckon this will give them the opportunity to buy into little-known companies that could emerge as the stars of tomorrow when they list on the market.																								If picked judiciously, these investments could offer blowout returns and enable the insurers to offer higher bonuses to their policyholders. 																								We are not allowed to invest in the equity of unlisted companies, says Pankaj Desai, executive director (sales and distribution) at Kotak Life Insurance. This could offer an important investment avenue for us if the Indian market continues to grow the way it has.																								The sensex  the bellwether index of Indian stock markets  is offering returns of around 40 per cent this year after it crossed 17000.																								Its always good to have options. Investment in private equity will help us diversify our wealth. They will provide higher returns in the long run, said Puneet Nanda, chief investment officer at ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.																								IRDA chairman C.S. Rao is, however, more circumspect. Before allowing insurers to invest in the equity of unlisted companies, we need to thoroughly analyse their track record and solvency margins. Although such investments could fetch higher returns in the long run, it could also lead to erosion of policyholders wealth, he said.																								It will take a little more time for the private insurance companies in India to handle the risks attached to such investments. But we will definitely take up this issue at our committee meeting to gauge the risk appetite of the private players. Before permitting such investments, we will have to consider various parameters such as solvency margins, asset-liability mismatches and track record, said S.V. Mony, secretary general of the Life Insurance Council.																								Even the LIC baulks at making these risky bets. It has invested only 0.1 per cent of its total assets of Rs 613,000 crore in private equity.																								Investing in private equity may prove to be beneficial in the long run. However, we should remember that we are not a developed economy like the West. The private equity industry in India is still at a nascent stage. The market will have to mature before it can hope to see significant sums invested in essentially risky ventures, said a senior LIC official.																								Over the past five to seven years, private equity investment has grabbed some attention with the emergence of a few successful small and medium scale enterprises, especially in the area of IT and IT-enabled services.

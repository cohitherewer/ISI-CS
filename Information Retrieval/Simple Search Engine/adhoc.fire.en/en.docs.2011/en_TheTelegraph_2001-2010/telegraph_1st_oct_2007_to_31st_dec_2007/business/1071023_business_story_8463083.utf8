				 Banks in salary account rush
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 More on offer																								Mumbai, Oct. 22: After the mad scramble to attract retail customers, banks have started battling each other to lure the salaried individual.																								Two banks  Kotak Mahindra Bank and Union Bank of India (UBI)  today launched schemes for salary accounts, peppered with features that they hope will draw customers away from competing banks offering plain vanilla schemes. Kotak Mahindra Bank calls its product Salary 2 Wealth account. The private sector bank claims that the product is a comprehensive suite to cater to the financial needs of professionals. 																								Public sector Union Bank launched its Union Super Salary Account (USSA), which will offer multiple benefits.																								HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and the State Bank group are the big players in the salary account business. In most of the cases, the individual does not have to maintain any minimum balance. However, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Union Bank have moved a step further. The principal advantage to a bank is that it gets a readymade customer base from such accounts. This base can be later used to hawk other products in the banks portfolio.																								K.V.S. Manian, group head of retail liabilities and branch banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank, said the scheme would offer conventional banking services and top it with features such as a demat account, portfolio management services, office banking and the facility to invest a minimum amount of Rs 500 per month. All these will come bundled with its product.																								Manian said the bank would not come out with a one-scheme-that-fits-all approach as other banks had done in their portfolios. Kotak Mahindra Bank has divided the customer profile into three segments  top, middle and entry-level management. 																								Not to be left out in the race, Union Bank also has launched its USSA. Its chairman and managing director, M.V. Nair told newspersons that while this account could be opened with a zero balance, the customer on opening the account is provided with a kit containing cards, access codes and multi-city cheque book within 48 hours.																								An additional feature is that USSA will provide an overdraft facility to the extent of the 90 per cent of the net salary credited in the previous month.

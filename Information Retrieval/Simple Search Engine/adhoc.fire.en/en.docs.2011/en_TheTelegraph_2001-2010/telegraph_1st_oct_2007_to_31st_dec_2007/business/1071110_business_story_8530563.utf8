				 Construction, mining boom benefits Ural
 AMIT CHAKRABORTY				 	 Riding on success																								Calcutta, Nov. 9: Ural India, the Haldia-based heavy-duty- truck maker, has sold 150 vehicles in the last one year to transport operators who lease them out to contractors in mining, infrastructure and construction.																								Ural has benefited from the surge in mining and construction activities in the eastern region at a time when orders from the defence have dried up. 																								The Indo-Russian joint venture depended heavily on the defence for business, but has not received any orders since the company rolled out its first 240HP 49-tonner vehicles in November 2006. 																								Defence orders need a lot of formalities, said Anirudh Kanoi, director of Ural India.																								The company, however, has received orders for spare parts of vehicles from the defence, which owns about 3000 Uralz vehicles (original Russian name). Most of these vehicles are 15 to 20 years old, he added.																								These trucks are used by the defence as field artillery vehicles, high mobility trucks, recovery vehicles, bullet and mine proof vans, troop carriers, rocket launchers and other highly specialised applications.																								Over the past year, Ural India has localised about 50 per cent of the component in value term. Only the engine and gear box in completely-knocked-down condition are being imported now, Kanoi noted. The company hopes to roll out 500 trucks by March 2008, Kanoi said.																								With a base price tag of Rs 27 lakh, the 6x6 wheeled heavy- duty truck has caught on with transport companies operating in coal and iron ore mining for use as dump trucks and tippers. These vehicles are also being used in dam construction, concrete mixer movement in large housing and infrastructure projects, Kanoi said.																								The police and fire services departments are likely to place orders for four vehicles for troop movement and fire fighting.																								Kanoi added that the company has been negotiating with the authorities in Bangladesh, Nepal and some African countries for export of Ural trucks from Haldia.																								Ural India has so far invested about Rs 100 crore out of the total projected outlay of Rs 500 crore. The balance will be invested as and when production picks up, Kanoi said.																								The company plans to set up an automobile ancillary park near the plant at Dighsipun in Haldia town. Acquisition of land alongside the existing 100-acre factory land would be made as and when the ancillary park project takes off.

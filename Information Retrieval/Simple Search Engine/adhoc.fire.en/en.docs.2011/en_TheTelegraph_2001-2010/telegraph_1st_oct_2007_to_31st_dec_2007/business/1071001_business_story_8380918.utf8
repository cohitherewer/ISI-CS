 Car loans now come with a floating rate option. But is it such a great idea, asks Srikumar Bondyopadhyay 																								ICICI Bank, the countrys largest private sector bank, introduced floating rate repayment for car loans a few days back. Some public sector banks did it a few months ago. However, there is a debate if the floating rate option really makes sense for a car loan as no one offers such loans for more than seven years.																								The State Bank of India, its subsidiaries and the Bank of Baroda are offering loans for new vehicles on a floating rate basis from April this year. 																								Punjab National Bank offers both fixed and floating options, but it has included a clause from April to reset the rate in the fixed repayment option every year. Therefore, the banks fixed rate in car loans has virtually turned into a floating one. 																								Risk factor																								In fixed rate loans, borrowers are insulated from future fluctuations in interest rates. The bank shoulders the interest rate risk and hence it charges a higher rate compared with the floating rate. 																								The floating rate comes at a discount, which is perhaps the prime attraction of this repayment option. The borrower is liable to pay a higher or lower rate as and when the general interest rate goes up or down in the future. 																								Fixed tenure																								In home loans, a borrower has the benefit of readjusting the loan repayment period subject to a maximum tenure without changing the equated monthly instalment (EMI). 																								In car loans, the tenure cannot be readjusted simply because the repayment period is short. 																								In other words, in a floating rate car loan, the borrower will have to pay a higher or lower EMI whenever the interest rate goes up or down. 																								Difference counts																								A floating rate option in a car loan is only useful if the interest rate discount (the difference between the fixed and floating rate) is high enough. 																								ICICI Bank charges 13.5 per cent interest under the floating rate option for car loans, which is only a 0.50 percentage point discount to its fixed rate of 14 per cent. 																								By choosing the floating rate option, you could save Rs 28 per month for every lakh of rupees taken as loan or Rs 2,352 over the entire loan tenure of 7 years. 																								You will have to weigh this saving against the interest rate risk that you would take by opting for the floating option. 																								Interest rates on car loans are generally high and repayment periods are short. So, unless the interest rate discount is high, you wont be able to save much by opting for the floating rate.																								Prepayment penalty																								Moreover, prepayment of a car loan attracts stiff penalty, unlike a housing loan where you can prepay up to 25 per cent of the outstanding principal without any penalty. So, you should opt for the floating rate option if and only if you believe that the general interest rate will come down in the near future. 																								Do you win?																								Fixed rates are more transparent in the sense the interest rate wont change during the loan repayment period. 																								Floating rates are linked with the banks benchmark prime or retail lending rate. The effective lending rate works out as the benchmark rate plus or minus a mark-up. Banks change their lending rates (floating) for borrowers by changing either the benchmark rate or the mark-up or both.																								When banks lowered their rates between 2001 and 2003, the interest rate (floating) for existing borrowers was lowered only when they reduced their benchmark rates in keeping with the signals from the Reserve Bank of India. 																								Meanwhile, banks offered its new customers a lower rate than its existing borrowers simply by reducing their mark-ups. So, if you go for a floating rate option today, your interest rate may not be reviewed every time the bank reduces its lending rate  it could be done for new borrowers only. 																								But when interest rates rose between 2004 and 2007, banks were quick to raise their benchmark rates and the lending rates for their existing borrowers. 																								New borrowers paid as high an interest rate as existing borrowers.																								Shop cheap																								But what options do you have when all banks are shifting towards the floating rate regime? If you have to take a car loan on a floating rate basis, shop for the cheapest rate and weigh the other associated cost and charges such as processing fees and prepayment penalty charges.

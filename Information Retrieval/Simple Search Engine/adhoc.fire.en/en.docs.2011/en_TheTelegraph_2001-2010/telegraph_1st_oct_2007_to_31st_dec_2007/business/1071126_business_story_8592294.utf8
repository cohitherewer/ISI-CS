 Q amp;A				 MF horizon
																																																																																													 I have invested Rs 25,000 in an equity scheme of a mutual fund in October this year. I want to withdraw my money after five years. Will my investment continue to earn dividend every year? Depending upon the current trend in markets, what returns should I expect after five years?																																																																													R.P. Mukherjee, Khidderpur
																																																																																													Equity schemes come with two options  dividend and growth. If you had opted for the dividend option, you will get dividend as and when the mutual fund announces a payout under the scheme. Dividends are announced for one financial year only. In other words, if a mutual fund declares a dividend, the payout will be only for the financial year in which the announcement has been made and not for following years. As regards to returns, it is entirely dependent on the market condition and the performance of the particular scheme. Nobody can predict the markets. Particularly, overseas cues largely prompt movements in domestic markets. However, considering an 8 per cent GDP growth coupled with an inflation rate of 3 to 4 per cent, you can assume a 12 to 15 per cent annual growth in profitability of companies. 																																					Bonus shares																																																																																															 I was an employee with BHEL. The company allotted me 100 shares in 1994 under its employee stock option scheme. In June this year, I got 100 bonus shares. Do I have to pay capital gains tax if I sell the shares now? 																																																																													Ashim Kumar Sen, Chandannagar
																																																																																													You will have to pay short term capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent on the 100 bonus shares if you sell it now. But you dont have to pay any such tax on the initial 100 shares allotted to you.																																					Grievance redressal																																																																																															 I invested Rs 10,000 in two tax saving bonds with ICICI Bank to get income tax rebate. The redemption date of those bonds was June 15 this year. But in spite of writing several letters to the bank and to its registrar, 3i Infotech Ltd, Mumbai, I havent received the redemption proceeds till date. 																																																																													Ranjan Chakraborty, Hooghly
																																																																																													 Send a copy of the complaint letter written to ICICI Bank, send it to the banking ombudsman at the RBI office in Calcutta explaining the situation. You can mark a copy to the income tax department. But first take it up with the grievance redressal officer of ICICI Bank.

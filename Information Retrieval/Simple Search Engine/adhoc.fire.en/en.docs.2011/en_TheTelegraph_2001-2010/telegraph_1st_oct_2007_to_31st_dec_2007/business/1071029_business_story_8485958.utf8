				 A free market route to eradicate poverty
 SEETHA																								New Delhi, Oct. 28: If what you are going to do with the land industrially puts it to a higher value use than the person who owns it now, you should be able to buy it. You should not need the government coming in. The principle of eminent domain should be used very selectively. 																								Words that should warm the cockles of all those who feel market-oriented policies are to blame for Singur, Nandigram, Kalinganagar and much more. Surprise. These are the words of Peruvian free market guru, Hernando de Soto, president of the Lima-based Institute for Liberty and Democracy and author of The Other Path: The Economic Answer to Terrorism and The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else. 																								De Soto may not be familiar with Indias hot button economic policy issues but the focus of his work is on those very subjects  land rights and economic exclusion. 																								If capitalism is perceived as a system that provides opportunity not for everybody but only for a few, it will eventually collapse, he warns. If the system only benefits a few, that means it is clogged up with the rules favouring the elite and excluding the poor. Its important, he says, to study the history of the poor trying to get into business and see where the blockages are. Once that is identified empirically, both the Left and the Right will support you; they will have to be crazy not to. 																								Poor people are at the heart of de Sotos philosophy of market economy. There is enough evidence, he insists, that the poor are not the problem but the solution. The market economy is essentially about scale. How can you get scale if you dont bring in the poor? Theyre the consuming mass and are conglomerated, which is needed for the division of labour. 																								Property rights for the poor is, he says, the key to help them move ahead. Property is not necessarily land but the right to give an asset  tangible or intangible  a series of functions, like creating credit or capital, somewhat akin to a Swiss army knife. 																								That item has to be fungible. Otherwise, property will be like a single blade knife, with limited uses. Its also important to provide security. If people feel the government is going to expropriate them without any form of compensation, they will simply stop any movement towards change, he warns. Without this right, their chances of making it in a capitalistic world are zilch. 																								And that could breed a helplessness, which is at the root of terrorism. 																								Terrorism is usually born where there is helplessness, when you dont see a future. But, he observes, terrorists provide services  protection of the businesses and the assets of the poor. If the government gives the poor a property right that is efficient and protects it, terrorists will lose their constituency. 																								What of the danger of this right being used to prevent the clearing of encroachment on public land, the problem that most city administrators face when dealing with slum clusters? 																								Removing 100,000 people who have encroached on government land is not realistic; its not going to happen. 																								What the state must do is empower them and find a way to make sure that when it does, it is not going to set an example for more encroachments. Everybody would prefer to earn their land through legal measures than illegal measures. Illegal measures are not costless. People will always choose the law provided its cheaper than the illegal part.

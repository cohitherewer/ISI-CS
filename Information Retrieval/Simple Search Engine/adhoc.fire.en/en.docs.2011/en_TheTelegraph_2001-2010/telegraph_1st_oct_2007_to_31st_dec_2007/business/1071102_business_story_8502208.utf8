				 Nifty hits a sixer
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 1: Nifty, the 50-share index of the National Stock Exchange, today scaled another milestone when it breached the 6000-mark in intra-day trading. 																								The index rose 111.30 points to touch an intra-day high of 6011.95 points in early trading because of heavy buying by foreign funds after the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points. 																								However, it could not sustain the gains as profit booking saw it ending lower by 34.20 points to close at 5866.45 against yesterdays 5900.65. 																								Nifty made the journey from 5000 to 6000 in 24 trading sessions. It crossed the 5000-mark for the first time on September 27.																								The sensex today ended 114 points down on sustained volatility. Stocks beat a hasty retreat after an initial surge because of a late selloff by operators and foreign institutional investors. 																								Almost all the major benchmark indices were in the red. Auto, FMCG and realty shares fell 2.10 per cent, 4.16 per cent and 2.96 per cent, respectively. 																								L amp;T shares jumped 4.30 per cent, while Reliance Industries today fell 4 per cent to Rs 2671.60. Reliance Energy dropped Rs 99 and Bharti Airtel slumped Rs 64 to Rs 942.95.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 30: Jet Airways plans to fly to Brussels, its European hub, from five more cities  Calcutta, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Amrtisar and Bangalore.																								Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal said, Under the existing agreement, we operate 28 flights from Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai to Brussels in a week. Once the bilateral aviation treaty between Belgium and India is reviewed, we can double the number to 56 and include more cities.																								Jet has launched flights to Toronto and New York via Brussels. In the US, there are also direct flights to Newark, which is in New Jersey, from Mumbai. 																								Goyal said Jet planned to fly to three more US cities from February. 																								The flights are to San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington DC. 																								The airline recently announced flights to Shanghai from Mumbai. 																								It is the only private carrier in India that has got permission to fly to the Gulf. 																								Jet has also applied for permission to fly to Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. 																								We expect our revenues to double to $3 billion from $1.4 billion over the next three years, Goyal said. 																								International expansion will help domestic operations make money. Every year, we will increase our domestic revenue by 15 per cent, he added.																								Goyal, who was speaking on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum, said half of this topline growth would come from overseas operations.

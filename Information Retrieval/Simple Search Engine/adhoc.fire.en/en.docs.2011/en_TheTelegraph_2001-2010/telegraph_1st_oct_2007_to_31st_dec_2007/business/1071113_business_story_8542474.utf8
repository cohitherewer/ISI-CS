				 Industry growth slips in Sept
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, Nov. 12: The countrys industrial growth slowed down to just 6.4 per cent in September, the lowest this year. 																								The dismal show comes after a spectacular 10.7 per cent industry growth in August, as a lending squeeze effected by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the stronger rupee, which is hurting exports, started biting industry.																								The index of industrial production (IIP) for September last year was 12 per cent. For the first half of the current fiscal (April-September 2007), too, the IIP slipped to 9.2 per cent against 11.1 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago, an official release said today. 																								However, the government dismissed speculation that this reflected a slowdown that could substantially take the sheen off the India growth story. Analysts, including the governments own think tank  The Institute of Economic Growth  had predicted a slowdown but not to this extent. The IEG had forecast an 8.2 per cent growth.																								Speaking at the Economic Editors conference, finance minister P. Chidambaram said, I would be loath to draw any conclusion based on one months data ... we feel both industry and service sector which make up about 83 per cent of the economy, will grow by 9-10 per cent.																								Manufacturing output rose 6.6 per cent in September from a year earlier compared with the revised annual growth of 10.5 per cent in August.																								The Indian economy grew by 9.4 per cent during the last financial year and is expected to grow between 8 per cent and 9 per cent this fiscal. 																								Chidambaram said between April and September this year industrial production grew by 9.2 per cent, while manufacturing was up 9.7 per cent and capital goods, considered a key indicator of the economys health, grew 19.6 per cent. 																								Amit Banerjee, an economic analyst with a leading state-run bank, agreed. A single months figures cannot be considered to be a trend. The monetary policy has been tightened and this has impacted growth, thats for sure.																								Growth in bank lending has come down from 29 per cent a year ago to 23 per cent because of higher interest costs. 																								But the growth momentum is there, lending is still quite high and we expect industrial growth to continue, Banerjee said. 																								A government report released here today said capital goods would maintain its current high growth rate but there was a need to revive the demand for consumer durables, to restore industrial output growth to double digits.																								Banks have already started cutting consumer loan rates to push demand for homes, cars and white goods.

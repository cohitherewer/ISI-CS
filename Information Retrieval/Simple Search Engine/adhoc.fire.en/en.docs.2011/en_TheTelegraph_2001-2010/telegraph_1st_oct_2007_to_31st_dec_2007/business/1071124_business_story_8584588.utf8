				 Kenya frets over low tea prices
 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA																								Guwahati, Nov. 23: Kenya, Indias biggest rival in tea exports, is getting lower unit prices while the cost of production is on the rise.																								The Kenyan crop by the end of this year is projected to be 20 million kg higher than the 310 million kg produced last year when the country experienced a drought.																								Sicily K. Kariuki, managing director of the Tea Board of Kenya, said, Our tea fetched over $2 per kg last year while this year we are getting $1.5-1.7 per kg. We had improved crop conditions in the first half of the year, but in the second half the rains are delayed, the temperature is high and hailstorms are frequent. We do not expect to add more than 20 million kg this year over last years figure.																								Kariuki and the chairman of the Tea Board of Kenya are attending the India International Tea Convention in Guwahati. 																								Indian exports till September were lower by 17 million kg but, unlike Kenya, the price per kg had been higher by Rs 6 to Rs 7 per kg. 																								But cost of production is also high. In Kenya, the cost of production has been steadily rising over the last five years. About five years ago, the cost was $1.2 per kg. Now it has gone up to $1.5 per kg. The rise will affect exports in the long run, especially if our tea fetches the kind of prices it is doing now, said Kariuki. 																								Pakistan sources between 80 and 87 million kg of Kenyan tea annually. India is trying to increase exports to Pakistan from 10 million kg to 30 million in the next five years. 																								Kenya will chair the first International Tea Producers Forum, which will address the concerns of tea producing nations. 																								Closed gardens																								A committee on closed tea gardens has recommended that Section 16 (E) of the Tea Act of 1953 be invoked at two closed gardens in Bengal  Raipur and Chinchulla  and five gardens in Kerala.																								The section empowers the Centre to take over the management of gardens without investigation. 																								In phase two, the section may be introduced in six more gardens in Bengal  Bamon Danga, Tondo, Sikarpur, Bhandarpur, Bharnobari, Theklapara  and another three in Kerala, Tea Board sources said. 																								Kenya also heads the inter-governmental group on tea under the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.																								The constitution, rules and the individual agreement of the 25 tea producing nations have been drafted and discussed on the sidelines of the ongoing convention in Guwahati.																								The drafts of these instruments would be sent to each of the producing nations for approval. The initiative, which started in Nairobi in November 2006, was followed up in Colombo this year and formalised in India, will hold its fourth meeting in China in May 2008 where China will take over as chairman of the forum, said Dunstan M. Ngumo, chairman of the Tea Board of Kenya.																								In an age of rising input costs such a forum is essential to help producers collectively bargain with traders.																								Closed gardens																								A committee on closed tea gardens has recommended that Section 16 (E) of the Tea Act of 1953 be invoked in two closed gardens in Bengal  Raipur and Chinchulla  and five gardens in Kerala.																								The section empowers the Centre to take over the management of gardens without investigation. In phase two, the section may be introduced in six more gardens in Bengal  Bamon Danga, Tondo, Sikarpur, Bhandarpur, Bharnobari, Theklapara  and another three in Kerala, tea board sources said. 																								These gardens have been given some time to complete their talks with prospective buyers and if the talks fail, only then the section will be invoked.																								Egypt is the second largest buyer of Kenyan tea. India has been trying to open a tea marketing centre in Egypt along with an Indian tea restaurant for the last 16 months but has been unsuccessful.

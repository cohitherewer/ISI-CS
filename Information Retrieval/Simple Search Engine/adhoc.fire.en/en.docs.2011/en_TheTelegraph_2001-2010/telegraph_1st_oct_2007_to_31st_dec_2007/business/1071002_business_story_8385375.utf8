				 Indica gears up for UK rerun
				 	 The english way																								London, Oct. 1 (PTI): The Tata group will relaunch the Indica in the UK at an attractive price.																								Known to Europeans as the City Rover, the Indica was rolled out in November 2003 but failed to lure consumers. 																								It appears that the pricing was the reason (for the failure), said S.A. Hasan, managing director of Tata Ltd, the wholly owned subsidiary of the Tata group in the UK. The car was launched at a price band of 6,500-8,500.																								We are working on the modalities and everything will be decided later, Hasan told reporters when asked about the details of the re-entry.																								The Tatas introduced the Indica in the UK through MG Rover. This time it will handle the rollout on its own.																								The City Rover pretty much fulfilled peoples expectations. It had big benefits in handling and comfort. Elderly people were loving it  which is a factor missing in the UK, he said.																								On whether the relaunch would depend on the buyout of Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford, Hasan said a decision would be taken after something concrete emerged. We are serious about our bid for Jaguar and Land Rover, he added.																								Ford, which acquired Jaguar in 1989 and Land Rover from BMW in 2000, had said in June that it planned to sell the two companies to focus on its North American operations. 																								On whether they had completed a due diligence for the British cars, Hasan said, There are lots of serious bidders and it will take its own time.																								The Tatas are not new to acquisitions. In January, Tata Steel acquired Anglo-Dutch firm Corus for $12.1 billion. In 2000, Tata Tea bought the UKs Tetley tea brand for over $400 million.																								Hasan said there was a lot of scope to expand in the automotive business in the UK. 																								The group has a wholly owned subsidiary, Tata Motors European Technology Centre, in the UK to assist Tata Motors.																								The centre was established in 2005. We also have a sales office of Tata Motors, which sells brands such as the Safari and the pick-up models. This augurs well when we re-launch the Indica, he said.																								The technology centre has 75 employees, while the Tata Motors centre has 26.

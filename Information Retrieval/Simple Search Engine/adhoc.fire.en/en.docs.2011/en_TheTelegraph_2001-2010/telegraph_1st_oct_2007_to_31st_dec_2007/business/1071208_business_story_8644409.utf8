				 High capital inflow still a headache

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								New Delhi, Dec. 7: The biggest challenge before the government is to manage high capital inflow without affecting economic growth.
																								Ringing the alarm bell in the mid-term economic review, finance minister P. Chidambaram has warned that inflow of foreign funds was more than what the economy could absorb, leading to the appreciation of the rupee. This could endanger growth and price stability.
																								Increased capital inflows can impact macroeconomic aggregates through the exchange rate, trade and monetary variables. This was particularly manifested in the first half of the current financial year and thus the management of capital inflows has been and is likely to remain an important issue, the finance minister said.
																								During the first half of the current fiscal, the economy grew at 9.1 per cent with agriculture showing signs of acceleration. Farm growth rose to 3.7 per cent from 2.8 per cent in the corresponding period last year, the Mid-Year Review 2007-08, tabled in Parliament, said.
																								Even as the economy had been expanding at 9 per cent and above, the government admitted that growth needed to become more inclusive so that benefits of upswing could be shared by all sections of the society.
																								While the impetus to growth would continue to be provided by industry and services, growth in agriculture and absorption of labour in productive areas would need focused attention, it said.
																								According to the review, managing capital inflows is a complex problem as it is linked to inflation, trade policy, capital market development and issues relating to production, investment and growth.
																								The fiscal cost of sterilisation envisaged at Rs 3,700 crore in the budget estimates of 2007-08 is now being supplemented with Rs 4,500 crore, it said.
																								Admitting that rupee appreciation could lead to job losses, the review said medium and long-term solutions lie in making exports more competitive.
																								Referring to infrastructure bottlenecks, the review said high cost of power alone was affecting the competitiveness of domestic industry. 
																								Inflation drops
																								The rate of inflation declined to 3.01 per cent for the week ended November 24, as food items, particularly vegetables, turned cheaper.
																								The wholesale price index-based inflation was 3.21 per cent in the previous week and 5.55 per cent in the same period last year.

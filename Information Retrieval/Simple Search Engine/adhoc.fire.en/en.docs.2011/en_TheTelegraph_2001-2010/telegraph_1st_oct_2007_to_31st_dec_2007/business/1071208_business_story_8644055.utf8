				 Eicher Motors plans a ride with Volvo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
				 	 New Partnership
																								Mumbai, Dec. 7: Eicher Motors is weighing a strategic partnership with Volvo for its commercial vehicle and allied business.
																								The Eicher board will meet on December 10 to discuss a proposal for strategic partnership, the company said.
																								Although the Delhi-based company did not disclose any names, Swedish truck giant Volvo is understood to be the frontrunner.
																								Eicher Motors, which makes trucks, buses and chassis, now has a 33 per cent market share in the 7-to-11-tonne segment. 
																								It has a manufacturing facility located at Pithampur in Madhya Pradesh. It also entered into the heavy commercial vehicle segment with the Eicher 20.16, which it says, has been designed and developed indigenously.
																								In 1986, Eicher entered into a technical and financial collaboration with Mitsubishi Motor Corporation of Japan to manufacture the Canter range of vehicles. However, the agreement with Mitsubishi ended in March 1994 after achieving total indigenisation.
																								Reports of Eicher inducting a strategic partner for its commercial vehicle business has been doing the rounds for some time now. Analysts say global companies are keen on Indias commercial vehicle market, which is the fifth largest in the world. 
																								With the economy growing at around 9 per cent, the potential for the sector is big. Various regulations have also helped the industry. For instance, commercial vehicle sales grew after the Supreme Court banned overloading of trucks.
																								The interest shown by global companies can be seen from the agreement signed recently between Ashok Leyland and Nissan Motor Company. The two companies have decided to form three joint ventures supporting the light commercial vehicle (LCV) business. 
																								There were reports earlier that Daimler, the worlds largest truck maker, was close to striking a partnership with Eicher. However, the German giant is now likely to team up with the Hero group.
																								Volvo is among the top five truck makers in the world and it has a plant in Bangalore. 
																								On the NSE today, the Eicher share gained 7.30 per cent over its previous close.

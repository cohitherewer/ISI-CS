				 BSE first choice for online debt trading 
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, Nov. 6: The government wants the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) to set up an online debt trading system with common clearing and settlement infrastructure.																								But first it will set up a broad-based corporate bond development body with representatives from the finance ministry, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the Reserve Bank of India.																								This committee will oversee the setting up of the new debt market and its future development. Sebi will regulate the debt market.																								Government officials as well as the high-level committee that had formulated a road map for a corporate bond market last year feel the BSE is best equipped to float the terminal. It doesnt make sense to set up a separate exchange for corporate bonds right now ... that can come after it grows to a certain size.																								The BSE is also the preferred option as the NSE is owned by financial institutions and banks, which will be the main players in the corporate debt market. 																								The government has long felt the need for setting up a robust domestic corporate debt market to stem the rush for foreign debt. 																								It believes that the reinvigorated corporate debt market can garner the funds India Inc will need in the years ahead to continue growing at a fast pace. 																								Development of a corporate debt market will reduce the flow of external debt into India. It will also help companies access funds at reasonable costs ... floating stocks is not such a cheap option as servicing equity can be quite costly, especially as Indian investors expect not only high dividend pay-outs but also bonus issues, officials said. 																								Analysts said Indian companies had turned to foreign lenders because corporate debt had few takers in India. 																								But dollar debts being serviced by the rupee could prove risky if the rupee starts depreciating again. 																								Much of the corporate bond market is for debt papers meant to finance long gestation infrastructure projects, officials said. 																								Officials said the corporate debt market had the potential to raise resources for infrastructure and housing projects and even for corporate brownfield expansion. 																								We need to develop various market segments, including mortgage-backed securities and bond insurance institutions.																								Many of the recommendations of the high- level committee on corporate bond market has already been worked upon and the necessary conditions created. Others are being done now, the officials said.																								The committee had sought simplification of listing and disclosure norms, rationalisation of stamp duty and withholding tax, consolidation of debt, improved trading systems through introduction of an electronic order matching system, besides efficient clearing and settlement systems.

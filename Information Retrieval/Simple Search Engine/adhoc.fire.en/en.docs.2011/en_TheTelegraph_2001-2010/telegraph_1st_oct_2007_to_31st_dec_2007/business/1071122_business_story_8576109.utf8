				 Tulsi Extrusions to raise Rs 50 cr
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 21: Tulsi Extrusions, a Jalgaon-based PVC and HDP pipe and fittings manufacturer, is planning to tap the capital market with a public issue of 57 lakh shares, comprising 45.62 per cent of the companys post-issue equity. 																								The company, which has filed its issue prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India and is awaiting approval, aims to raise Rs 50 crore through the public issue to part-finance its Rs 68-crore expansion project.																								We are planning to install five extruder machines and injection moulding lines at our existing plant in Jalgaon at an investment of Rs 68 crore, said Pradip Mundhra, managing director of Tulsi Extrusions. 																								At present, we have a manufacturing capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) and after the expansion it will go up to 17,000tpa, he added.																								The promoters of the company will chip in with Rs 8 crore, while the remaining Rs 10 crore of the project cost will come from internal accruals and borrowings from banks and financial institutions.																								Mundhra added that the initial public offering would be a fresh issue of equity and there would be no offer for sale (of equity) from promoters. 																								The Sebi approval is expected in another 20 days and we are planning to hit the market sometime in January next year, Mundhra said. 																								The company is looking at an issue price of between Rs 85 and Rs 100 a share. Tulsi Extrusions reported a turnover of Rs 32 crore for the six months ended September this year compared with Rs 64 crore for fiscal 2006-07. We are targeting a revenue of Rs 72 crore by March 2008, Mundhra said.

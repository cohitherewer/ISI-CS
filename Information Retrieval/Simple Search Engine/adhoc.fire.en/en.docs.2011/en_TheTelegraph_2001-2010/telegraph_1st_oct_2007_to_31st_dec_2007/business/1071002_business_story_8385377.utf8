				 Tax-refund succour for exporters
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Nath: Helping hand																								New Delhi, Oct. 1: The government today ruled out regulating the rupee but would help exporters with a higher refund of both state and central taxes.																								Commerce minister Kamal Nath said, We do not calibrate the rupee, but our government will meet different export promotion councils in the next two to three days and see how we can refund taxes.																								Nath said the proposal to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in some industries would be ready by the end of this month. Some of the beneficiaries include airport ground handling, sports goods, petroleum and gas.																								Large capital inflows through the FDI route and stock markets have led to the rupee appreciating by over 7 per cent in the first half of this fiscal. The rupee today, however, lost ground to close at 39.85 against the dollar, following suspected intervention by the Reserve Bank of India and some dollar buying by importers.																								Exporters have taken the brunt of the appreciation in the rupee. In August, the export growth rate dropped to 18.91 per cent ($12.69 billion) from 41.14 per cent a year ago.																								The decline was much sharper in rupee terms, with the growth rate decelerating to 4.31 per cent from a huge 50.57 per cent in the same month last year. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations today said eight million would lose their jobs if the government failed to check the rupee surge.																								While assuring exporters on refunds at a meet of the Chemical and Allied Products Export Promotion Council, Nath said they must change their strategies to meet future challenges such as currency appreciation and free trade pacts.																								Except some items, free trade pacts are aimed at eliminating duties. 																								There are such agreements with Singapore and Thailand, while negotiations are on with Japan, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union.																								India has to enter into trade agreements because it needs to integrate with the rest of the world ... India cannot be isolated, Nath said.

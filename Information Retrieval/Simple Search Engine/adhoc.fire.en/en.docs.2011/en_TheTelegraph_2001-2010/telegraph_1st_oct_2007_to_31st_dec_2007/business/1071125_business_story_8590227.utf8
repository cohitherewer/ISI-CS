				 Spectrum meet minus PSU duo 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 24: State-run telecom companies  Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam  have been excluded from the panel to review spectrum allocation norms recommended by the Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC).																								The panel, headed by DoT additional secretary R. Bandhopadhyay, comprises representatives from GSM and CDMA operators. It will meet on November 26 and November 30.																								The TEC had given its report on spectrum allocation norms earlier this month, suggesting manifold increase in subscribers for the allocation of additional radio waves.																								Communication minister A. Raja had accepted the report in principle, but in view of strong protests from GSM operators  Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular  the government constituted a panel to revisit the norms.																								The committee has to give a report by the end of this month.																								The department of telecom had said the committee would come out with new allocation norms that are scientific and practicable. 																								It had hoped that after the committee was set up, GSM players would withdraw their petition and enter into negotiations to find a solution to the spectrum allocation stalemate.																								Some of the private operators said discussions might not serve a purpose if BSNL and MTNL are left out. 																								Public service enterprises have to face many constraints in their operations, not the least being aggressive lobbying by competitors to stymie their expansion, Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce, had said recently in a letter to Bharti boss Sunil Mittal on a matter related to spectrum allocation.																								According to telecom experts, public sector units have done far better in meeting social obligations compared with private players. BSNL, in particular, has fulfilled the social role much more effectively than all private companies put together.																								BSNL sources said it was very logical for the two PSUs to be part of the panel that was going to take a decision on spectrum allocation norms, a crucial component for growth in the telecom sector. 																								The PSUs have played a significant role especially in the rural areas but they are always taken for granted, a source said.

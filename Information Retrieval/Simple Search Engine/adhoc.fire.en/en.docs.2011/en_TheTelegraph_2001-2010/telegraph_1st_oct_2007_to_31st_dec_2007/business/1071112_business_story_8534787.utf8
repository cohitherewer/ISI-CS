				 Uco Bank warms up to follow-on offer
 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY			Cash counterCalcutta, Nov. 11: Uco Bank will appoint a minimum of four investment bankers for its second public offering scheduled for February next year.																								Investment bankers who made their presentations to the city-based public sector bank are IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd, JP Morgan, Kotak Securities, ICICI Securities, Enam Financial and AK Capital.																								We will appoint at least four investment bankers to manage the issue because each of them has a different area of specialisation, said S.K. Goel, chairman and managing director of Uco Bank. 																								The bank is yet to receive the final approval of the Union cabinet for its capital restructuring plan. Till then, it cannot appoint the investment bankers. 																								We expect to receive the final approval this month. Meanwhile, we are completing other ground works for the public issue, Goel said.																								After the cabinet nod, it would take the bank at least two months to get the Sebis approval for the flotation. 																								We need to raise capital before the end of the current financial year. We are targeting a date in February next year for the second public offering, Goel said.																								Uco Bank had proposed to reduce its equity capital base, which at the end of September this year stood at Rs 799.36 crore, by converting Rs 300 crore equity of the government into preference shares. 																								The governments shareholding stands at 74.98 per cent. The bank proposed a fixed dividend of 7.5 per cent per annum on the preference shares and the finance ministry accepted the proposal in principle. 																								After the conversion, the banks total paid-up equity capital will come down to Rs 499.36 crore and the governments shareholding to 59.9 per cent. 																								Without reducing the governments share below 51 per cent, Uco Bank can raise up to Rs 90 crore through the second public issue. 																								Going by the current market conditions, we expect the issue to fetch a premium of Rs 35 per share (having a face value of Rs 10 each), Goel said. The State Bank of India is also expected to tap the capital market at around the same time to raise Rs 5,000 crore.																								Uco Bank reported a 50.06 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 243 crore for the first six months of the current financial year.

 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta (centre) with Abhijit Bandyopadhyay (right), chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and Sunil Talati, president of the institute, in Calcutta on Friday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Nov. 22: The Bengal government today sought the assistance of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to strengthen its internal audit system. 																								Speaking at an audit conference organised by the ICAI here today, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta said, We are probably the first state in the country to institute a division within the finance ministry nine years ago to carry out internal audit.																								We now seek your help in improving and strengthening the internal audit processes, he told the chartered accountants present at the meeting.																								At present, the internal audit cell of the state finance ministry is looked after by officials on deputation from the Comptroller and Auditor Generals office. But the performance of the cell had been less than satisfactory and the state had returned some of the central governments development funds simply because it could not utilise it.																								The finance minister has sought our help in improving the internal audit system in the finance ministry to start with. Later on all government departments will be subjected to internal audit, said ICAI council member and chairman of internal audit committee Abhijit Bandyopadhyay.																								Dasgupta has also sought the help of practising ICAI members to stop false reporting of VAT (value-added tax) returns. Some of the dealers often claim tax credit for inputs, which they have never used. On verification, it is found that these dealers do not exist at all. I, therefore, would request ICAI members to look into this problem and plug the gaps, Dasgupta said. 																								Speaking about the ICAI efforts on internal audit, Bandyopadhyay said the institute would introduce standards specific to the subject.By the year-end, the ICAI will come out with 10 standards. Already three standards are in place and the rest are under various stages of approval, he said.																								The standards on internal audit, which have already been approved, are basic principles of audit, planning and documentation.

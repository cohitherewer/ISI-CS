				 China airline eyes expansion
 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA																								Kunming (China), Nov. 11: After Delhi and Calcutta, China Eastern Airlines is keen on direct flights from more Indian cities.																								The airline has a daily flight from New Delhi to Shanghai, its main hub, and has recently launched a four-times-a-week service between Calcutta and Kunming, which is in the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan and the airlines second hub. 																								Flights from Calcutta comes at a time when China is gearing up to open a consulate office in the city.																								Yang Xu, general manager and head of China Eastern Airlines, Kunming branch, said, We had many choices to start our second direct flight, from Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi. However we chose Calcutta which is the gateway to the East. He said prospects for the Calcutta flight were very promising. 																								Depending on international regulations and agreements between India and China, we would be happy to look at other destinations to operate direct flights.																								Earlier, tourism minister Ambika Soni had said there were plans for 50 weekly flights between the two countries. China Eastern initially had three flights from Calcutta, raised to four because of the good response.																								The company is also exploring the possibility of upgrading to a Boeing 737 from the 50-seater Canadian Royal Jet. It also expects Kunming to become a transit point for passengers from India, especially those from eastern India.																								Xu suggested an Indian consulate in Kunming or in any other city in Yunnan that would increase the flow of tourists from China. As many as 450,000 travelled between India and China last year. 																								Initially there would be more business or government officials availing of the flights which would gradually extend to tourists as more flights are added and awareness increases, Xu said. 																								He said as bilateral trade increases more passengers would travel to and from India and China. 																								The bilateral trade reached $25 billion last year and is set to surpass the target of $40 billion by 2010. 																								Since 1997-98, Indo-China trade has registered a growth of 260 per cent, an average yearly growth of around 33 per cent.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 16: German firms are likely to participate in the proposed auto component park in Bengal.																								The park will be set up by the state government in partnership with Bengal Shrishti Infrastructure Development Ltd. Covering 500 acres, the park will require an investment of around Rs 1,165 crore. 																								We have identified land near Guptamani, Kharagpur. The developer will directly purchase the land. We have requested the German engineering federation to inform its members about this project, said Nirupam Sen, state minister for commerce and industry.																								Sen was speaking at an interactive session with a 16-member German delegation that visited the city today.																								Shrishti Developer might also consider applying for SEZ status.																								We have been informed about the project. We will pass on the details to our members and I am sure that the park will witness a lot of German participation, said U. Ackermann, managing director of the engineering federations foreign trade division and head of the delegation.																								Kharagpur is also the site for the upcoming Tata Construction Equipment Company Ltd, a 60:40 joint venture between Tata Motors and Japans Hitachi Construction Machinery Co.

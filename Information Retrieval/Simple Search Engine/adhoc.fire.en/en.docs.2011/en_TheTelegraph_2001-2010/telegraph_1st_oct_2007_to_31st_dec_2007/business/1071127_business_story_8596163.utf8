				 Banks get high marks in McKinsey test
 							 - Local entities outperform most global indices with highest return to shareholders OUR CORRESPONDENT 	Mumbai, Nov. 26: Leading Indian banks, including seven public sector entities, are among the worlds best banks in terms of increasing shareholder value, allocating capital effectively and contributing to GDP growth, says a McKinsey report that was prepared for a two-day bankers conference that opened here today.																								According to the McKinsey report, at least 14 leading banks have performed remarkably well to contribute over 5 per cent to the GDP and improved capital allocation resulting in lower levels of non-performing assets. 																								Given the current growth trend, officials said banks alone would provide over 3.5 million jobs over the next three years. 																								The Indian banking sector is at a watershed. Its overall performance is imperative to track and measure progress so that it continues to meet its objectives  contribute to the nations GDP, provide increased value to shareholders, foster financial inclusion, effectively manage intermediation costs and allocate capital to maintain stability, said H.N. Sinor, chief executive of the Indian Banks Association. 																								The report said Indian banks had outperformed most of the banking indices with the highest total returns to their shareholders. 																								During January 2000 and October 2007, the Indian banks posted a return of 36.76 per cent, which was almost double the returns by Chinese banks at about 17.57 per cent, and almost four times higher than the 9.34 per cent return reported by British banks. 																								The report, which was based on a survey of seven public sector banks, four private sector banks and three foreign banks, said the Indian banks had witnessed loan growth at over 30 per cent and deposit growth at about 18 per cent over the past three years. 																								While the overall profitability of newer banks and legacy banks are on par at 15 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, the latter earn 33 per cent return on equity (RoE) on their retail businesses compared with an average of 16 per cent by the former. 																								However, the legacy banks were earning 9 per cent RoE on their remaining businesses compared with 15 per cent by newer banks. 																								Considering the average lending rate at about 13 per cent and deposit rate at about 8 per cent, the Indian banks witnessed high intermediation costs of about 5.1 per cent during the financial year 2007. 																								This was particularly driven by low overall efficiency, low operating efficiency and the regulatory cost for cash reserve ratio, statutory liquidity requirement of 25 per cent and priority sector lending at 40 per cent. 																								The report found that the gross NPA for the banks came down to about 3 per cent in 2007 from 9 per cent in 2003. 																								However, the report suggested that the banks needed to strengthen their overall funding and liquidity practices to meet global standards. 																								Because of geographical fragmentation, the banks are able to tap only about 47 per cent of the total Indian household savings, suggesting that a large part of the countrys population still remains untapped.																								As on March 2006, Indian urban centres accounted for almost 60 per cent of total savings deposits, despite only 27 per cent of the population residing in 4,000 urban locations across the country.

				 Ghose exits, Sobti is IndusInd CEO

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Mumbai, Dec. 7: Ramesh Sobti is taking over as managing director and CEO of IndusInd Bank.
																								Sobtis appointment was announced today after the sudden resignation of Bhaskar Ghose. Over the past few days, rumour mills here had been speculating about Ghoses exit.
																								Sobti is the executive vice-president and country representative at ABN Amro Bank
																								In a late evening announcement to stock exchanges, IndusInd Bank said Ghose had submitted his resignation to the board of directors of the bank and that he had agreed to continue in office till the new incumbent took over.
																								The board also okayed Sobtis appointment which will have to be cleared by the Reserve Bank of India. IndusInd Bank did not say why Ghose was leaving. Ghose could not be reached for comment.
																								Ghose had been credited with transforming the bank and beefing up its retail operations. 
																								Apart from joining hands with Religare to offer portfolio management services, the bank has been on an expansion spree. Earlier, it had come out with a GDR issue after which its net worth rose to Rs 1056 crore as on March 31.
																								The bank has a network of over 170 branches, spread over 141 geographical locations in 27 states and Union territories in the country. It also has representative offices in Dubai and London. Since the merger of Ashok Leyland Finance in June 2004, the bank has expanded its retail portfolio.
																								IndusInd Bank has also been planning to raise capital by inducting a foreign bank as a strategic partner. Interestingly, ABN Amro, the foreign bank from where Sobti comes, was at one point of time rumoured to be picking up less than 5 per cent in the new generation private sector bank.

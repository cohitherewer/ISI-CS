				 Blackstone registers $113m loss
																								New York, Nov.12 (Reuters): Blackstone Group LP on Monday reported a third-quarter loss on non-cash charges related to compensation to employees.																								Blackstone reported a net loss of $113.2 million, compared with a net income of $372.5 million a year earlier.																								The loss includes the impact of $802.6 million of non-cash charges associated with compensation arising from IPO unit awards and the amortisation of intangibles, Blackstone said.																								Revenue rose to $526.7 million from $461.5 million.																								Last week, Blackstone had invested $65 million for a stake in Indian engineering firm MTAR Technologies.

The funding is a mix of primary and secondary equity. 																								We are very enthusiastic about this investment as we foresee a huge growth opportunity for MTAR both in domestic and global markets, said Akhil Gupta, chairman of Blackstone Advisors India.

				 Govt approves 8.5% rate on PF deposits
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 20: Over four crore subscribers of the employees provident fund (EPF) will earn an 8.5 per cent interest on their deposits for 2006-07. The Centre today approved the rate recommended by the EPF board.																								Central provident fund commissioner A. Viswanathan said, The government has notified the rate of interest for the year 2006-07 at 8.5 per cent.																								Labour and employment minister Oscar Fernandes has asked regional provident fund commissioners to issue the annual statement of accounts for 2006-07 immediately. 																								The Central Board of Trustees of the EPF had recommended an 8.5 per cent rate in July despite opposition from trade unions. 																								The unions were seeking higher returns. 																								They said bank fixed deposits were paying attractive interest rates.																								Commercial banks are offering up to 9.5 per cent returns on fixed deposits depending on tenure. 																								However, banks are beginning to reduce rates, as they are flush with funds and credit offtake is slow.																								The 8.5 per cent rate will lead to the disbursal of Rs 7,550 crore in the accounts of provident fund subscribers but will not result in any deficit for 2006-07. The rate of interest payable for employees provident fund deposits was 8.5 per cent in 2005-06 also. 																								To pay the rate to its nearly four crore subscribers, the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had to meet a deficit liability of Rs 365.89 crore from its own resources.																								The EPFO had paid Rs 6,889.04 crore as interest to its subscribers last year. 																								However, its projected interest income was Rs 6,523.15 crore during the period.																								Officials said it is difficult to increase the payout of EPF as the returns on investments, entirely in low-paying gilt bonds, do not allow them to do so. 																								The over Rs 1,40,000-crore EPFO fund invests about 80 per cent of its corpus in the Union governments special deposit scheme. 																								The remaining 20 per cent is invested by the State Bank of India treasury in other government and state-run corporation bonds and instruments, which fetch a slightly higher rate of interest. 																								The current average yield from EPF investments is estimated to be at around 8.15 per cent, with public sector securities yielding the highest return.

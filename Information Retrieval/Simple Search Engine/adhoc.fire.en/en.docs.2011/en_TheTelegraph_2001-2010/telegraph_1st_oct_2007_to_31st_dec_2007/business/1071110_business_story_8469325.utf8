				 Realty takes big strides in Tier II cities
 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE				 	 Building dreams																								New Delhi, Nov. 9: Property buyers are eyeing Tier II cities as real estate prices in the metros have hit the roof.																								Kunal Banerji, president, marketing and corporate communications, Ansal API said, Around 60 per cent of the total of 7,000 acres of land that we are developing in North India is mostly in Tier II cities.																								An improvement in infrastructure in the smaller cities has also encouraged the buyers. Issues such as higher interest rates and fears of a real estate bubble have not affected their decisions.																								Analysts, however, said that in these cities the demand for housing was growing at a faster rate than the demand for retail and commercial space.																								Banerji said: Of the total space we are developing in Tier II cities, 80 per cent of it is housing space and the rest is retail and commercial combined. Ansal is developing properties in Lucknow, Jodhpur, Panipat and Karnal.																								DLF, however, is experiencing a surge in the growth of commercial space. 																								It is developing 25 million square feet of commercial space in Tier II cities and has a land bank of 65 million square feet for this purpose.																								S. Roy, advisor, DLF Limited, said, We are developing 35 million square feet of land for homes and a similar amount of land for office and retail space combined in Tier II cities. 																								He said many IT and ITeS companies were shifting to cities such as Chandigarh and Ahmedabad because of lower operating costs, availability of skilled manpower and quality infrastructure.																								Ansals Banerji projects 20 per cent growth in retail space in Tier II cities on a year- on-year basis. 																								He said, Hotels and SEZs are also poised to grow here at the rate of 15 to 20 per cent in the next couple of years.																								DLF said it was growing by 40 per cent in cities such as Ahmedabad and Chandigarh. DLF is developing more than 10 IT parks and IT SEZs in the country.

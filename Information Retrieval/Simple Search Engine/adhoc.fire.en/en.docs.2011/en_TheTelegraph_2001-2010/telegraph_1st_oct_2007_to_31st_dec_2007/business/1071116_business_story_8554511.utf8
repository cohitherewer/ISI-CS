				 Iraq threatens oil ban on RIL
 OUR CORRESPONDENT			TROUBLE BREWSMumbai, Nov. 15: The Iraqi government has threatened to blacklist Reliance Industries (RIL) just over a week after the Mukesh Ambani-run oil giant signed a deal with the Kurdish regional government to hunt for oil in two blocks without Baghdads approval.																								Iraqi oil minister Hussain al-Shahristani said RIL and 14 other foreign players that had signed deals with the Kurdistan government ran the risk of being barred from bidding for future oil contracts in the worlds second largest oil-producing nation.																								Our position is very clear. Any company that signs contracts with the Kurdish regional government without the approval of the federal government will compromise their chances of getting future opportunities in Iraq, Hussain said.																								RIL had signed the contract for the Rovi and Sarta blocks in northern Iraq with the autonomous Kurdish regional government (KRG). The blocks, measuring 517 and 607 sq km respectively, have an almost 80 per cent oil bearing structure. 																								While paying a signing amount of $15.5-17.5 million for the blocks, RIL said that it was confident of making a discovery soon. 																								Reliance officials were scrambling to play down the significance of the statement after being sucked into the controversy.																								This is just an outcome of the hostile political environment in Iraq. KRG has signed block deals with 15 companies in the region, including Reliance. Any action taken by the government will affect the other 14 companies as well, sources close to the development told The Telegraph. 																								The two exploration blocks in northern Iraq in the Kurdistan region for which we have signed the agreements are within the legal framework. Reliance has always maintained highest cordial relationship with the government of Iraq and all other stakeholders in countries where we operate. We will continue to do so in the future, the company said in an official statement. 																								The semi-autonomous KRG has struck 14 production sharing agreements (PSAs) this year despite objections from Baghdad. Iraqs oil minister has said the oil deals that the KRG had signed since February were illegal.																								Hussain said, Iraq will not allow its oil to be exported without the federal governments approval. We have informed and warned the companies of the consequences. They will not be able to take oil out of the country. 																								The Kurdish region is located in land-locked northern Iraq and has no port facilities, which makes sale of gas without Baghdads approval virtually impossible.

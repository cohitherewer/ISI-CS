				 Tatas rule out hostile bid for Orient-Express 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Kumar: Plainspeak																								Mumbai, Oct. 29: The Tata group has no plans to launch a hostile takeover bid for Orient-Express Hotels.																								Indian Hotels Company of the Tatas has bought a 10 per cent stake in Orient Express and expressed interest for a partnership with the New York Stock Exchange-listed entity. 																								R.K. Krishna Kumar, vice- chairman of Indian Hotels, said, At 10 per cent, we are still the single largest shareholder in the company. We have no plans of a hostile takeover. We have had talks with the management recently. We can be a good partner for them.																								He was speaking to reporters at the sidelines of the Infrastructure Investment Conference. 																								However, Dubai Holding, the investment arm of the Dubai government, has made an open offer for Orient-Express. 																								A hotel analyst said Indian Hotels should seek growth opportunities from within rather than make an acquisition. IHCL (Indian Hotels) should look more at synergies with Orient-Express like cross -selling. 																								Indian Hotels, through its wholly owned subsidiary Samsara Properties, had bought the stake in Orient-Express Hotels for $211 million. 																								Orient-Express oversees 49 hotels in 25 countries and operates luxury trains and cruises. 																								Indian Hotels manages, owns and operates 83 hotels worldwide, of which 66 are in India. 																								The company has plans for 127 hotels by 2010 and will raise about Rs 1,924 crore through a rights issue to finance its expansion plans.																								It has recently acquired luxury hotels in Boston and San Francisco. 																								Orient-Express owns and manages the renowned Hotel Cipriani in Venice, the Villa San Michele in Florence, the Mount Nelson in Cape Town, the 21 Club in New York and the Observatory Hotel in Sydney.

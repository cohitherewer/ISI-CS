				 Tea exports take a beating
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 17: Tea exports were down by 5 million kg in September. The unit price per kg, however, had increased compared with last year.																								Domestic auction prices are also set to rise as the crop production dropped to 113.1 million kg in September from 124.4 million kg last year, according to figures released by J Thomas amp; Co Ltd.																								For the week ended November 9, there was no sale of CTC tea in Calcutta or Siliguri. The market in Guwahati, however, witnessed a good demand. For the week ended November 16, the CTC variety fetched a good price. Major blenders, packers and buyers from western India operated strongly with good support from other internal markets, said Amit Chaudhuri, chairman and managing director of J Thomas amp; Co Ltd.																								Between January and September, exports were down to 118.7 million kg from 155.8 million kg last year. The value of tea rose to Rs 98.6 per kg against Rs 91.56 per kg last year.																								The prices are expected to remain robust as there are no surplus stocks this year to be carried over to the next year. Last year, despite an excess stock of 23 million kg, tea prices rose by Rs 5-7 per kg.																								McLeod Russel India Ltd is looking to repeat the record tea price of 1999-2000, its highest-ever in recent times.

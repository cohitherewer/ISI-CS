				 Power bidders in race for Jharkhand project
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Many suitors																								New Delhi, Nov. 9: Reliance, Tata Power, NTPC and Larsen amp; Toubro are expected to bid for the Rs 16,000-crore power project at Tilaiya, Jharkhand, the first such project in eastern India.																								The bids will close on Monday, amidst concerns of an inadequate response from international bidders. Domestic majors are more keen on these huge projects  nine of which have been planned for the country as a whole, officials said. 																								Global bidders may shy away from the project because of the security threat posed by the Maoists. 																								The project is in a forested, Naxalite-infested area with substantial presence of tribals, who may oppose a land acquisition.																								Other likely bidders from India are Sterlite Industries, the National Thermal Power Corporation, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, DS Construction Pvt Ltd and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd.																								Sources said the bidding would get a boost if American energy company AES Corp, Chinas largest power equipment manufacturer Dongfang Electric Corp, Japans Sumitomo Corporation and other international players, who had initially evinced interest, finally participate.																								The Krishnapatnam project in Andhra Pradesh, in which Reliance Power has placed the lowest bid, saw only three companies in the fray.

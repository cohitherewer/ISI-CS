				 Tilaiya power project attracts most bids
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT			Energy BoostersNew Delhi, Nov. 12: The 4,000MW Tilaiya power project in Jharkhand has received bids from around 13 firms, including new players. 																								This is the highest number of bids received by any mega power project. 																								The Krishnapatnam unit in Andhra Pradesh managed to draw bids from three firms, Sasan received nine final bids, while six firms showed interest in the Mundra project																								Larsen amp; Toubro, Lanco Infratech, Reliance Power, Sterlite, Tata Power, AES, Dian Wijaya (Malaysia), Essar, NTPC and Jindal Steel and Power were among those which submitted their request for qualification to the Power Finance Corporation, the nodal agency for implementing mega power projects.																								Officials said the evaluation committee would examine the bids in 15 days, after which the request for proposals or price bids would be invited. The companies will have 50 days to submit the final price bids after the date of issue of the request for proposal.																								This will be the fourth power project with a capacity of 4,000MW to be put up for bidding by the government.																								Lanco Infratech is back in the race after it lost its bid for the Sasan power project in Madhya Pradesh. Lanco Infratech had placed the lowest bid of Rs 1.19 per KWh, but was ruled out after it changed partners midway.																								Reliance Power, which bagged the Sasan project, is the lowest bidder for the Krishnapatnam project. 																								Tata Power has been awarded the Mundra project in Gujarat.																								Officials had expected a mild response to the Tilaiya project because of the region being prone to naxal attacks. 																								There are also many tribal groups living in the region, posing land acquisition and displacement problems.																								The pit-head project will be built on a super-critical technology. It will supply power to New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand.																								The power ministry has set a target of adding 78,577MW of generation capacity during the 11th Plan (2007-12). At present, the installed power generation base is 136,000 MW.

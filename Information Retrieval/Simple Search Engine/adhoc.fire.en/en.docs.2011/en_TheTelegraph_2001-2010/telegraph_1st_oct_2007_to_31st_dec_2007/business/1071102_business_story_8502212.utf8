				 Panel to write drug policy prescription
 GARIMA SINGH NEOGY				 	 BOOSTER DOSE																								New Delhi, Nov. 1: A group of ministers is expected to meet tomorrow to take up the national pharmaceuticals policy that aims to bring more drugs under price control. 																								Sources said the GoM, chaired by agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, would discuss the controversial policy, which seeks to extend price control to 428 drugs compared with 74 at present.																								In January, Union chemicals and fertilisers minister Ram Vilas Paswan had prepared a cabinet note on the new drug policy, which was later referred to the GoM. 																								For the 74 drugs that are now under control, the note had proposed that the maximum retail price should not be more that 100 per cent of the manufacturing cost.																								For another 354 drugs, the note recommended that the price ceiling could be 200 per cent of the maximum manufacturing expenses. 																								Pharmaceutical companies often charge up to 1,000 per cent of the production cost.																								However, the government believes that a 200 per cent margin will let them make a profit while curbing profiteering. 																								Drug companies are not happy with the move and have been lobbying against it.																								In its meeting with the GoM in September, the Confederation of Indian Industry, represented by Ranbaxys Malvinder Mohan Singh, had argued that the new price controls could directly and indirectly cover 60 per cent of the market. The ministry, however, had maintained that the policy would only cover 32 per cent of the market. 																								The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) argued that the cost-based system relies on normative costs, which ignores product quality, manufacturing standards, R amp;D investment and export market development expenditures. 																								Though the price control move is appealing to consumers, the IPA has warned, the benefits may not be lasting as manufacturers will tend to cut back production of un-remunerative items.

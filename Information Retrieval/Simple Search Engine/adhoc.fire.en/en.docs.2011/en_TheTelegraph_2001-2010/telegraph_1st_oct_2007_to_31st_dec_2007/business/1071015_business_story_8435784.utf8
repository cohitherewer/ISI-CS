				 Loans against property pick up
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Oct. 14: Commercial banks are seeing a huge business opportunity in collateralised loans against property at a time when the Reserve Bank of India has tweaked its risk weights on real estate loans. 																								State-owned, private sector and foreign banks are now pushing loans against property, or LAP schemes, where an individual or a business can take a loan against residential or commercial property and use it for a variety of purposes. 																								These loans are usually given up to 60 per cent of the market value of the property. 																								While the interest rates on loans are now between 12 and 14 per cent, an LAP is usually given for a period of 10 to 15 years. Several banks have been offering LAP for more than two years, but it is only now that these loans have started to really catch on. 																								Bankers say there are two reasons for this trend. First, customers are finding that they can get loans at lower rates of interest than other competing products such as personal loans. Second, banks are comfortable about LAP because it is collateralised against property. 																								Banks now want to take the product to new geographies. Centurion Bank of Punjab (CBoP) started offering LAP since late 2004. These loans are now growing in excess of 40 per cent. 																								Vivek Vig, country head (retail) at CBoP, told The Telegraph that the bank now wants to take LAP to Tier I and II cities from the metros. 																								The bank, which has a presence in over 183 cities, is targeting 60 to 70 new cities as part of this expansion programme. Although Vig did not come out with his banks LAP disbursal figures, he said one of the reasons for the sharp growth in credit offtake has been the different approach it has taken from competing banks. 																								In LAP, the private sector bank has been focusing on self-employed individuals, both professional and non-professional categories such as traders, importers, store-owners, and suppliers. 																								Banks do not disburse LAPs above Rs 80 lakh and some stipulate a minimum property value. Vig, however, indicated that in CBoPs case, the loan amount could even go up to Rs 5 crore. This depends on the market value of the property and the individuals repayment capacity. 																								Most banks have one policy for the whole market, but we tailor our offering to the requirements of the borrower, he said. 																								Vig added that CBoP offered borrowers flexibility with both EMI-based loans and an overdraft facility in LAP. 																								Other banks that are aggressively offering LAPs include ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Citibank, the State Bank of India, the Union Bank of India, and the Bank of Baroda.

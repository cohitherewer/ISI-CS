				 Oil diplomacy in full swing
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Singh: African safari																								New Delhi, Oct. 10: India is embarking on a round of oil diplomacy with Nigeria.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is off to the African country on a three-day visit starting Sunday, accompanied by a team of businessmen that includes representatives from Indias state-run and private oil companies.																								One of the objectives of the visit is to clinch oil blocks and ensure greater energy security for India.																								In exchange for three blocks, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and the LN Mittal group have jointly drawn up plans to invest up to $6 billion in the former British colony. 																								The duo will invest in a refinery, a power plant, roads and railway lines. They are waiting for the final approval from the Nigerian government before committing themselves to the project. ONGC expects to produce about 600,000 barrels of oil from the blocks.																								Essar Global, which has interests in energy, steel and telecommunications, also plans to invest $60 million in prospecting for oil in the African country.																								Nigeria, last year, accounted for 11 per cent of Indias petroleum import. Bilateral trade stood at $7.9 billion, with the balance tilted in favour of Nigeria.																								Turkmenistan gas																								Petroleum ministry officials said India planned to join the US-backed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India-gas-pipeline project next month.																								The deal is likely to be sealed at a meeting next month in Islamabad.																								This comes after India stayed away from a meeting in Teheran on a pipeline for Iran gas through Pakistan.																								By dilly-dallying on the Iran deal, India is making concessions to the US which is opposed to the pipeline, analysts said.																								As an alternative, the US is promoting the Turkmenistan pipeline. 																								Turkmenistan has estimated gas reserves of 159 trillion cubic feet (tcf), of which 34.26 tcf is for the pipeline project. 																								Sources said the pipeline would be built by a consortium of national oil companies from Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India by 2011-12. 																								The draft agreement provides for India paying transit fees to Afghanistan and Pakistan for the passage of gas through their territories.

				 Be a good manager
 Organising your finances and assets into an estate plan can give you peace of mind, says Rishi Nathany																								Manoj Mitra, 45, is a consultant with a multinational firm. He likes his work, he is earning well, and saving up too. He has bought a flat in South Calcutta and a weekend home in Shantiniketan. 																								His father passed away in 2002 leaving him a house in his ancestral village along with various bank and post office accounts. Manoj is a disciplined man and has systematically saved money, invested in mutual funds, stocks and bought himself and his family life covers. But these days, Manoj often worries that his assets are not as well organised as he would like them to be. Often at night he wonders how his wife will handle all this property and money if something happens to him. 																								What Manoj needs is an estate plan. With the estate plan he can create, earmark and even separately manage his wealth or estate so that it can be passed on to his family. 																								An estate plan makes ones wishes clear and helps avoid family disputes and litigation. 																								Various tools such as investments, insurance, wills, power of attorney and trusts are used to create an estate plan.																								Investment planning: A proper investment plan will help Manoj preserve and enhance the assets he has built himself or inherited from his family. Moreover, it helps to channelise investments into tax efficient avenues, thereby reducing the taxes payable on the assets being built. 																								Manoj should invest most of the money inherited from his father in tax efficient investment vehicles such as equities or equity mutual funds, the dividends and long-term capital gains from which are free of tax. In India, there is no inheritance tax, so the main focus should be on making the investments that are part of the estate tax efficient, so that Manoj does not have to pay much tax while liquidating these investments or when his daughter inherits them. Insurance: As an estate planning tool, insurance will provide income protection to Manojs family in case of his untimely demise. The best way to do so would be to take a pure risk term insurance policy to cover the present value of his earnings till retirement. Since this amount of cover would be large, a term policy, which is the cheapest form of life insurance, will provide Manoj with the same at the lowest premium. 																								If Manoj passes away suddenly, his family will get a lump sum to ensure that they can maintain the same standard of living. Within a policy, Manoj can earmark how much of the risk cover should go to his wife and daughter.																								Wills: A will is a confidential legal document executed by people during their lifetime, which ensures that their assets are distributed according to their wishes after their death. A will can be made and signed by any competent major and can be on plain paper. It must be attested by two witnesses and should name the executor for the will. It can be revoked or modified any number of times within ones lifetime. If Manoj dies without having made a will, he is said to have died intestate and his assets will be passed on to his natural heirs. 																								However, through a will, he can mention to whom, when and in what proportion his assets will be passed on after his demise. Manoj may want to disinherit some family member who has fallen out of favour or include some friend, servant or charity as a beneficiary, which helps avoid litigation and family disputes. 																								The presence of a valid will helps appoint an executor to ensure that the directions in the will are properly carried out. One can appoint a guardian for ones minor children also in the will. However, the will should be kept with a neutral party such as a solicitor, who would open it upon ones death. While dealing with joint assets in a will, remember that you can only will your share of joint assets. 																								Power of Attorney (PoA): It is a legal authority given by one person (donor) to another (donee) to act on his behalf. A PoA can be general, which enables the donee to carry out all deals on behalf of the donor, while a specific PoA is given for a particular purpose. A PoA can be revocable or irrevocable. A useful tool to consider here would be a reciprocal PoA, which a married couple could give one another. 																								However, a PoA can be misused if given to an unsuitable person. Moreover, it is not a substitute for a will as it ceases to be valid immediately on the donors demise.																								Trusts: These are vehicles used to transfer funds/assets into a separate corpus for charity or for the benefit of some deity, relative or dependent. 																								The person who creates the trust is the grantor, the person managing the trust is the trustee, and the person/s for whose benefit the trust has been formed are the beneficiaries. Private beneficiary trusts are created to specifically earmark funds intended for minor children, elderly parents, disabled dependents and other beneficiaries. 																								Another reason for creating trusts can be to deny beneficiaries direct access to funds which they might squander away, while ensuring adequate income flows from it for their maintenance. A trust can be also formed according to instructions in a will, known as a testamentary trust.

				 Easier FDI, labour laws in 11th Plan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, Nov. 7: The government is likely to clear the Eleventh Plan tomorrow after almost a year of its inception.																								The plan promises to relax foreign direct investment and labour law norms, dereserve the production of textile items that are in the small-scale sector, reduce import and production duties and encourage contract and co-operative farming to realise the governments aim of faster and more inclusive growth.																								The plan hopes to achieve a growth rate of 9 per cent against the target of 10 per cent set by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last year. 																								Singh and his key ministers will meet members of the plan panel tomorrow to finalise the document. 																								The plan will try to bridge the divide between the rich and the poor by pushing farming and labour intensive industry growth.																								The plan hopes to bring basic civic amenities, jobs, skills and education to the minorities, backward castes, scheduled castes and tribes.																								The approach paper also seeks to create some 70 million jobs, mostly in manufacturing and services, and reduce educated unemployment to below 5 per cent. 																								However, the plan admits that inflation is likely to remain at 4 per cent for the entire period and oil-led inflation pressures can stay. 																								The plan says the government must target a 20 per cent rise in real wage rate of unskilled workers and work to reduce the headcount ratio of consumption poverty by 10 percentage points. 																								The government will work on a large number of programmes for skill training so that shortages can be addressed. It will also try to reduce the dropout rates of children from elementary schools to 20 per cent by 2011-12, which is the last year of the plan, from 52.2 per cent in 2003-04. 																								The government will also focus on a minimum standard of education in elementary schools; increase the literacy rate to 80 per cent by 2011-12 and lower the gender gap in literacy to 10 percentage points by 2011-12.																								The Eleventh Plan also wants to take forward the process of dereserving the small-scale sector, a move both the Left and the domestic small industry lobby could protest. Nearly 600 product lines are still reserved for the small-scale sector, including some textile items.																								The plan also favours changes in the Contract Labour Act.

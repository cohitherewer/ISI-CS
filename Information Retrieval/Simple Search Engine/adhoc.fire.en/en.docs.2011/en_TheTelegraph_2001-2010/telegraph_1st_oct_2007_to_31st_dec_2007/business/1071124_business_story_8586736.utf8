				 Hint of price policy pill
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Finance minister P. Chidambaram and his Iceland counterpart Arni Mathiesen (second from right) look on as Malana Power CEO Awadh B. Giri and Glitnir executive director Bala Kamallakharan exchange documents in New Delhi on Friday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha																								New Delhi, Nov. 23: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said there was a need for new policies that take into account the impact of the spiralling global crude prices on domestic inflation.																								It is important to factor in the price increase and adjust our policies so that inflation doesnt get out of hand, Chidambaram said.																								He said inflation had become a global concern as world crude prices threaten to break the $100-per-barrel barrier.																								Inflation fell to 3.01 per cent for the week ended November 10 compared with 3.11 per cent the week before. However, the government has not passed on the latest round of crude price increases to consumers; instead state-owned oil marketing companies have been forced to bear the crude assault and are selling fuels at prices below costs.																								Addressing a business delegation from Iceland, Chidambaram said Indias highest priority was infrastructure, with investments of $475 billion lined up for the sector during the Eleventh Plan (2007-12). 																								Our infrastructure is good enough to support a growth rate of 5-6 per cent, but not adequate to support 8-9 per cent growth. 																								Though the bulk of the amount will be raised from Indian markets, there will be a shortfall of $120-130 billion that needs to be raised abroad.																								Chidambaram said he was confident that policy-makers would master the nuances of global markets and suggest suitable prescriptions.																								On Thursday, Rakesh Mohan, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said the central bank would use all instruments available to it to manage liquidity in the system and maintain price. 																								These instruments include market intervention bonds, liquidity adjustment facility and cash reserve ratio.																								Chidambaram said India remained largely insulated from the subprime crisis in the US.																								We cannot afford shocks and major turbulence in our markets, so we are cautious and calibrated in opening up the capital and financial markets. But we have set the course to open up our markets, he added. 																								However, he expected some moderation in the demand for exports because of the subprime crash.																								Exporters are already reeling from the surge in the value of the rupee that has appreciated by over 10 per cent this year against the dollar.

				 Bourse for small firms
 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY																								Calcutta, Nov. 9: The competition for setting up a stock exchange exclusively for small companies is hotting up. 																								After a board meeting on October 25, Sebi chairman M. Damodaran had announced that the market regulator was planning to invite expressions of interest (EoI) for setting up an exchange exclusively for small companies on the lines of Alternate Investment Markets of the London Stock Exchange. 																								Following Sebis announcement, the National Stock Exchange in partnership with Sidbi (earlier Small Industrial Development Bank of India) filed its EoI. The BSE has recently submitted its proposal jointly with the State Bank of India (SBI). The countrys largest commodity exchange, the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX), is also in the race, sources said. 																								We have partnered with the SBI as it has the biggest portfolio of small and medium enterprises among all banks, said T.V. Rangaswamy, chief general manager of Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd. However, he didnt comment if the Calcutta Stock Exchange, in which it has recently picked up a 5 per cent stake, would be developed as a bourse for small companies in the future. 																								Smaller companies often find it difficult to compete with bigger companies in raising money from the capital markets and get themselves listed on the premier bourses. It would be easier for them to tap the market and get listed if we have a stock exchange exclusively for small companies, Damodaran had said during a press conference after the Sebi board meeting on October 25.

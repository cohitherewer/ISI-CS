				 Mobile licence call for lucky duo
 JAYATI GHOSE				 	 New entry																								New Delhi, Nov. 30: ByCell of Switzerland and Swan Telecom, in which Reliance Communications has some equity exposure, are likely to get new telecom licences to offer GSM services. These licences will come bundled with 4.4MHz of 2G spectrum.																								The department of telecom, which has been grappling with more than 500 applications for a unified access service licence, may grant new telecom licences to a maximum of two players on a first come, first served basis in the first round.																								However, theres a hitch in ByCells case. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) today deferred its proposal to increase its investment in the domestic telecom sector.																								In case ByCell fails to win FIPBs approval, Cheetah Communications, where also R-Com holds minority equity, may get the licence. 																								S Tel and Parsvnath Developers are the other two players of the five wait-listed telecom companies.																								While over 46 players slug it out for fresh spectrum in various telecom circles, it seems at least one of the two Anil Ambani-linked companies are more or less assured of getting a licence.																								ByCell had applied for a pan-India licence in September this year, while Swan and Cheetah sought 16 licences in March.																								ByCell, which is a Switzerland-registered company owned by Russian investors, had obtained FIPBs permission a year back to invest up to 74 per cent in a telecom joint venture in India. 																								The company then put in a fresh application with the FIPB to hike the quantum of investment. The company had earlier planned to invest $100 million over the next three-five years in 13 states across five telecom circles. But in September, it applied for telecom licences in all the remaining circles, thus requiring higher investments.																								However, with the home ministry seeking more time to go through the details of the firm and its ownership, ByCells proposal has been deferred.																								The proposal had come under the scanner after the Prime Ministers Office received certain complaints that the identity of ByCells owners was not known. 																								Additional details on directors of the company (including Indian directors), nationality and information on global operations of the company are currently being looked into, said sources.																								Shyam Telelink																								The FIPB has allowed Russian telecom player Sistema to hike its stake in Shyam Telelink to 74 per cent from 10 per cent at present. 																								In September, Sistema had picked up a 10 per cent stake in Rajiv Mehrotra-promoted Shyam Telelink for $11.4 million. 																								Shyam Telelink, which offers basic telephony services only in Rajasthan, has applied for new licences to offer unified access telecom services in 22 other states.

				 Mukesh, buddy put SEZs on fast track 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Cash course																								Mumbai, Nov. 19: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and Jai Corr  the firm promoted by Ambanis close friend Anand Jain  have invested $1 billion so far in two SEZ projects near Mumbai and the Revas port that they plan to develop.																								Jain told reporters on the sidelines of a real estate seminar here today that they had acquired 5,000 acres for the Maha Mumbai SEZ, 10,000 acres for the Navi Mumbai SEZ and another 500 acres for the port project. They expect to spend approximately $9 billion on the two controversy-ridden SEZs in the next few years.																								In August, the government granted an in-principle approval to RILs Maha Mumbai SEZ but asked the promoters to cut the size of the zone to 5,000 hectares in line with the new rules. 																								The commerce ministry had also asked RIL to ensure that the land was acquired with the consent of the owners and that it should not look for the state governments help to persuade people to sell the land.																								According to the earlier in-principle clearance, which expired in August 2007, the SEZ was expected to be set up on 10,000 hectares. 																								However, the government amended the rules in April to reduce the size of SEZs after widespread protests against forced land acquisition in the country. 																								The two SEZs are expected to attract investments from sectors such as banking, finance, pharmaceutical, automobile, gems and jewellery and other non-polluting industries.																								The Mumbai and the Navi Mumbai SEZs are being set up adjacent to each other.

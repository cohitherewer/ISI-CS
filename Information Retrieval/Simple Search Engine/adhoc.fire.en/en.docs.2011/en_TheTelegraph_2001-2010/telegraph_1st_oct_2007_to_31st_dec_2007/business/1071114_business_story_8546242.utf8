				 Tatas in supercomputing A-league
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, Nov. 13: Kimi Raikkonen just squeezed ahead of rookie-turned-star Lewis Hamilton to win the world title in the Formula One racing circuit in 2007 by just one point.																								Hamilton, who blew a 12-point lead going into the penultimate race at Shanghai, could be gasping in the slipstream of Raikkonens Ferrari next year.																								Reason: Raikkonens hot-rod is likely to be engineered after a blizzard of crash endurance tests whose results are analysed on the Eka  the worlds fourth fastest supercomputer and the quickest in Asia  that has been developed by Computational Research Laboratories (CRL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons.																								Built at an investment of around $30 million and at a crackling pace of just six weeks, Eka (Sanskrit for one) has a speed of 120 Teraflops (trillions of transactions per second), or the calculating ability of 20,000 personal computers. The ranking came from the the International Conference for High Performance Computing at Reno, Nevada, in the US.																								Now that weve proven ourselves, well showcase this technology to all our automotive clients, including Ferrari, said a TCS spokesman. The company provides engineering solutions to Scuderia Ferrari for the development of Formula One racing cars.																								Tata group chairman Ratan Tata said: I am sure this supercomputer and its successor systems will make a major contribution to Indias ongoing scientific and technological intiatives.																								Were planning to make the supercomputer available on a time-sharing basis on remote access too, said S. Ramadorai, chairman of CRL and CEO and managing director of Tata Consultancy Services.																								While refusing to divulge names, Tata group officials said several back-end operators working for oil and gas exploration companies have shown interest in using the supercomputer to crunch masses of data.																								Incidentally, Param, the supercomputer built by India in 1990 had the speed of one Gigaflop, or the ability of 500 personal computers. Built by India after the US refused to clear the import of a Cray supercomputer despite two years of negotiations, the Param was used for weather prediction and rocket stimulation for loading satellites. 																								Blue Gene  jointly developed by IBM and the department of energy at Livermore, California  claimed the pole position in the supercomp stakes, bettering its earlier performance of 280.6 Teraflops, to achieve 478.2 Teraflops.																								The second position was bagged by a newer version of another IBM system  a Blue Gene in Germany. 																								Eka, the Hewlett-Packard designed supercomputer, which was developed in six weeks in Pune, can also be used for drug discovery, weather and tsunami prediction, nanoscience and aerodynamic analysis, including aircraft modelling. 																								This machine will reduce animal tests as it can stimulate the way a drug affects human organs or the system without actually conducting trials or even manufacturing the drugs, said Seetha Ram, project head at CRL. 																								The supercomputer has also drawn the attention of noted drug researcher Rashmi Barbhaiya, who heads Advinus Therapeutics, the drug discovery company promoted by the Tata group in Pune. Im not very familiar with Eka. Once I return, I can look into this, said Barbhaiya in an email from California.

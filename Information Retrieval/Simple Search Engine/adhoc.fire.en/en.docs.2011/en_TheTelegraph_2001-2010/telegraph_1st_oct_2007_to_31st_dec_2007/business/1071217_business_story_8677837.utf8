 Q amp;A
				 Tax calculation

																																																																																													 My wife has some interest income from bank and post office deposits. She is 66 years old. Is she eligible for the basic exemption limit on income allowed to senior citizens for income tax purposes?
																																																																													S. Nandi, Bhadrakali

																																																																																													 Under section 64 of the Income Tax Act, total income of any individual will include all such income as arises directly or indirectly to the spouse of such individual from assets transferred directly or indirectly by such individual subject to certain conditions. In other words, if your spouse has always been housewife, her interest income from bank and post office fixed deposits will be clubbed with you for income tax purposes. 
																																					Tax on NSC
																																																																																															 I had deposited Rs 8,000 on July 6, 1990 and another Rs 2,000 on February 2, 1992 in National Savings Certificate with a post office. Since then I have not withdrawn anything from there. If I want to close the account will there be any tax deduction at source?
																																																																													Rabindra Misra, Salt Lake

																																																																																													Tax will not be deducted at source on the withdrawal from NSC, but the interest income under the scheme is taxable and it is the responsibility of the depositor to pay the tax on the interest income.
																																					Medical reimbursement
																																																																																															 In reply to one question you mentioned medical reimbursement is tax exempted up to a maximum of Rs 15,000. Is this exemption given under section 80D or any other section?
																																																																													A.K. Mukhopadhyay, Calcutta

																																																																																													 If an employee receives reimbursements for medical treatment of his own or any member of his family and dependant relatives, a sum up to Rs 15,000 per year is not treated as a taxable perquisite under Clause (b) of Section 17 (2) of the Income Tax Act. This exemption is enjoyed by the employee only if the expenditure is actually incurred. It may be noted here that there is no condition that the medical treatment should be at any of the approved hospitals. It could be at any place and from any system of medicine such as allopathic, ayurvedic, unani or naturopathy. However, if an employee gets a medical allowance, it is fully taxable.

 Q amp;A				 PAN card
																																																																																													 I am a housewife. I want to open a bank account. But the banks are insisting on a PAN card for opening an account. Can I get a PAN? I have no taxable income. After I am allotted a PAN, will it be compulsory to file income tax returns?																																																																													Aruna Sain, Salt Lake
																																																																																													 Anyone can get a permanent account number with the income tax department, irrespective of whether one has taxable or non-taxable income. It is also not mandatory to file returns if one doesnt have taxable income. 																																					Correct timing																																																																																															 I have started investing in mutual funds. I have invested Rs 30,000 in an equity scheme of a mutual fund. When should I redeem it  after three years or five years? What are the advantages and disadvantages of redemption after three years and five years? 																																																																													Shankar Chatterjee, Calcutta
																																																																																													The time limit of ones investment should take into account factors such as future financial liabilities like childrens education or marriage, the flow of income other than investments and the expected return from the investments. At times, the three-year return of a scheme may be higher than a five-year return. Again, a five-year return may also be higher than a three-year return. It all depends on the stock market. But an investor should have a target rate of return from the investments in mind. When this rate is achieved, the investor should partially book profits.																																					Withdrawal limit																																																																																															 What is the minimum lock-in period for an investment under the Varishta Bima Yojana of the Life Insurance Corporation of India  three years or five years? What percentage of PPF balance that has been renewed twice in blocks of five years can be withdrawn in emergency?																																																																													B.K. Singh, Patuli
																																																																																													The Varishta Pension Bima Yojana, which was launched in 2003 for senior citizens, has been withdrawn. The lock-in period for the plan was 15 years. Public provident fund subscribers, who continue with their account after 15 years, can withdraw every year subject to the condition that the total withdrawals during the five-year block period does not exceed 60 per cent of the balance to their credit at the commencement of the extended period.

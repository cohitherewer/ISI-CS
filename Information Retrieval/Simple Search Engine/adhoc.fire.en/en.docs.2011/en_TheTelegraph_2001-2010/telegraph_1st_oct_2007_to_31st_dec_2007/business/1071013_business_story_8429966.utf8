				 RIL to invest $13bn in petrochem, oil amp; gas
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mukesh Ambani in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Oct. 12: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is planning to invest $13 billion in its frontline businesses  petrochemicals and oil and gas exploration  over the next three to four years.																								Chairman Mukesh Ambani today told shareholders that $8-9 billion would be spent on its giant petrochemicals and refining complex in Jamnagar. 																								This facility would emerge as a super site, housing two refineries and a new 6-million-tonne-a-year coke gasification complex that would be the biggest of its kind in the world.																								The coke facility will gasify all the petroleum coke produced in the refineries. RIL also plans to invest another $4 billion in its oil and gas exploration business. 																								Ambani said Reliance would also be looking at acquisitions to spur growth. 																								Reliance is actively pursuing an acquisition mode of growth, Ambani said and added that it was moving away from its earlier strategy of building businesses from scratch as it faced intense competition, limited market opportunity and rapid changes in technology. 																								There are five fundamental strategic shifts taking place in Reliance. The first shift is from organic to both organic and inorganic growth, Ambani told shareholders at the 33rd annual general meeting held here today.																								The Reliance group intends to pursue inorganic growth opportunities in Asia for textiles and in Europe and North America for polyethylene terephthalate, an intermediate product used in bottles for colas.																								The second shift is from full ownership to both partnership and full ownership. This means the company will no longer look to hold 100 per cent in all its businesses.																								Reliance envisages an ecosystem of partnerships with global companies that can be hugely value accretive, he said and held out the example of Chevron which has picked up a 5 per cent stake in group company Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL). 																								Other changes are a shift from industry and services to agriculture and rural sectors, investment in innovation and a focus on sustainable global growth. 																								Reliance is expanding its paraxylene capacity to 4.5 million tonnes from 1.9 million tonnes, as a result of which it will account for 15 per cent of global capacity.																								Ambani said the new refinery of RPL would be completed ahead of schedule at nearly half the capital cost of similar plants being established elsewhere. 																								The new refinery will start production in December 2008.

Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Oct. 2: Maytas Infra Ltd wants the Andhra Pradesh government to pay more for the power from its Gautami Power Project.																								P. Chakrapani, senior vice-president (business development), Maytas Infra, said there would be cost escalations of Rs 250 crore, necessitating the higher tariff.																								Higher costs are because of the delay in the availability of natural gas, the feedstock for the project. The gas will be available only from December 2008. The construction of Gautami was over in September last year, but the project could not be completed because of the absence of gas.																								The 464-mega-watt project is at Peddapuram and involves an investment of Rs 1,300 crore from the promoters  IJM of Malaysia, Nagarjuna Construction Company and Maytas. AP Transco is the buyer of the electricity.																								Maytas has proposed two more options: a longer tenure of the power purchase agreement and permission to sell to other entities.																								A consortium of Maytas, Nagarjuna Construction, SREI Infrastructure Finance and Sarat Chatterjee amp; Co has won the Rs 1,255-crore Machilipatnam deep water port project, to be developed on a build, operate and transfer basis.

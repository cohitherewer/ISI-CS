				 Small towns to sell Tata car

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Calcutta, Dec. 8: Tata Motors small car will make its way even into smaller towns where the company does not have showrooms.
																								We are upgrading our offices in smaller towns where we sell only commercial vehicles to accommodate the small car. In some of these places we will sell Tata Ace and Magic, Lexus Motors director Binod Agarwal said on the sidelines of a meeting to mark the rollout of the one millionth car by Tata Motors in the city.
																								We will upgrade or open dealerships in Diamond Harbour, Baruipur, Uluberia, Krishnanagar, Habra, Chinsura and Barasat, he said.
																								The showrooms, to be branded Tata Motors, will for the first time display Tata Motors passenger cars starting with the Rs 1-lakh car. 
																								The showrooms will have an additional space of 800-1000 sq ft.
																								In Bengal, Tata Motors dealership for cars was, so far, restricted to metros and big towns.
																								Agarwal said most of these small towns would have a user profile of commercial vehicles coupled as also two-wheelers.
																								Tata Motors plans to launch four to five models next year, which will take its portfolio to 10 cars. 
																								We will introduce many models next year, but I cannot comment on the nature of the launch. It can be compact, sedan or an MUV, said S. Krishnan, vice-president (commercial), passenger car business unit of Tata Motors.
																								When asked if the small car launch was on track, Krishnan refused to comment.
																								Tata Motors may start the new year with the launch of a multi-utility vehicle, followed by a compact car and a sedan and some models in collaboration with Fiat, an industry source said.
																								The prices are expected to range between Rs 3.5 lakh and Rs 9 lakh.
																								Tata Motors has a market share of 21 per cent in passenger cars in Bengal. 
																								Around 8,500 passenger cars are sold in the state.

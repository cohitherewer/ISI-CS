				 UN index gives a jolt
 SEETHA																								New Delhi, Oct. 26: India is more vulnerable to oil price shocks than Iran, China and even Bhutan, but its better off than Thailand and Indonesia.																								India ranks fifth among 24 Asia Pacific countries in a new Oil Price Vulnerability Index (OPVI, where 1 is the least vulnerable), constructed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 																								The report  Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific  points that while oil prices (now touching $92 to the barrel) may not have dampened economic growth, the poor in Asia are bearing the brunt.																								Hafiz Pasha, UNDP regional director for Asia and Pacific, says the region has had to pay an additional bill of almost $400 billion for imports between 2003 and 2007. This is 20 times the annual aid flow to the region.																								The OVPI ranks countries on their economic strength and the extent to which growth depends upon imported oil. It is based on 18 indicators that track the level of dependence on oil imports and vulnerability to price fluctuations. The index, according to the UNDP, could help countries keep an eye on critical factors that can signal problems when prices jump.																								Whats helped India are access to other sources of energy, such as coal, a stronger economy and larger reserves.																								However, the growing economies of India and China can see annual increases of 3 per cent in oil consumption.																								What is working in Indias favour is its use of more energy-efficient technologies. These include both alternative fuels and a shift to sectors that are less energy intensive such as information technology and services.																								Reducing the oil intensity of development is no longer a matter of choice; it is the only course, the report advises.																								According to the UNDP the effects of the price rise have been mitigated by the global economic boom. Countries have also managed to stave off adverse consequences by cushioning consumers through subsidies. 																								However, the poor is being pushed further into poverty, the report notes. Between 2002 and 2005, interviews with poor households in China, India, Indonesia and Laos showed they paid 74 per cent more for their energy needs.

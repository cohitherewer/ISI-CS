				 Wake-up call for India Inc
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 8: India Inc is expected to report dismal results in the second quarter which kicks off on Thursday when Infosys announces its numbers.																								Leading brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities today predicted a profit growth of just 11.6 per cent in the second quarter after an analysis of 144 companies  and termed it the worst in the last seven quarters. Sales growth is projected at 10.5 per cent which, the report said, would be the worst in 10 quarters. A major factor impacting earnings is the surge in the rupee which has appreciated almost 3 per cent against the dollar during the June-September period compared with the year-ago period.																								The poor corporate results could trip up the sensex which has surged almost 39 per cent since January. In the past few quarters, profits have tended to be 4 to 5 per cent higher than estimates  and that has triggered the inflow of overseas funds into the Indian bourses.																								Going forward, this trend (of better than expected profits) may not be sustained Already, sales in the last two quarters have been lower than estimated. A stronger rupee, rising domestic and global competition, and high employee costs may make it increasingly difficult for companies to surpass expectations on a sustained basis, the report said.																								According to the brokerage, oil and gas, petrochemicals, automobiles, metals and pharmaceuticals were likely to be the sectors that could act as a drag on topline growth. 																								Retail is projected to be the fastest growing sector with a rise of over 65 per cent. Telecom is expected to report a revenue growth of 44 per cent. Oil and gas companies could suffer on account of higher under-recoveries and weakness in refining margins. The rupee surge will undermine the performance of pharmaceutical companies.																								While Infosys will kickstart the earnings season on Thursday, its the guidance of the Bangalore-based firm that is most awaited. Motilal Oswal said the operating margins of IT companies could be hit to the extent of 20 to 25 basis points due to the rupees appreciation. 																								Bombay Rayon is expected to see the highest sales growth of 114.3 per cent. Zee Entertainment could see net profits surge by 335.7 per cent. 																								The report said Dr Reddys Labs (-38.2 per cent) would be the worst performer in terms of sales and Raymonds (minus 76.4 per cent) would see the sharpest fall in net profits.

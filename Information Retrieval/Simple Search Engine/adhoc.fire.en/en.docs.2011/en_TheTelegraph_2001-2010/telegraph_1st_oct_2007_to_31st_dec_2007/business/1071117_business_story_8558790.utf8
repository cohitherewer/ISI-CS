				 Inflation inches up to 3.11%
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 16: The inflation rate has touched a five-week high of 3.11 per cent for the week ended November 3, on the back of higher prices of aviation turbine fuel, furnace oil and manufactured goods. 																								Inflation in the corresponding period of the previous year stood at 5.45 per cent, while it was 2.97 per cent a week ago.																								Analysts said the data was not a reflection of reality. The rate is artificially suppressed as the government has not passed on the global crude oil rise to consumers. 																								They said a rise in fuel prices was unlikely before the elections in Gujarat, which is due in December.																								While prices of food items such as fish-marine, eggs, moong and bajra increased, fruits amp; vegetables and poultry chicken cost less.																								Prices of aviation turbine fuel flared up by 5 per cent.																								In manufactured items, prices of imported edible oil, sunflower oil and ghee rose. However, prices of groundnut oil and sugar declined.

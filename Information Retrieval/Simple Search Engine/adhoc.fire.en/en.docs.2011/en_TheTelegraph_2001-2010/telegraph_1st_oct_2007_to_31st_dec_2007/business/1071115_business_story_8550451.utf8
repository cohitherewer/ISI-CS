				 Ministry proposes debt float to buy State Bank shares
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURYNew Delhi, Nov. 14: The finance ministry will place before the Union cabinet a proposal to allow the State Bank of India (SBI) to float a rights issue to raise Rs 16,700 crore.																								The government, which has a 59.73 per cent stake in the countrys largest commercial bank, plans to float government securities to raise Rs 10,000 crore, which will be used to subscribe to the SBI rights issue.																								Top finance ministry officials said the cabinet was expected to clear the proposal for the issue, which included a funding option through government securities bearing an interest rate of 8 per cent.																								This means we would annually pay Rs 800 crore as the cost of subscribing to this rights issue in one of the most profitable banks in the country. The income stream from the shares we would be subscribing to and the asset appreciation expected from this investment far outweighs the outgo and that is why the finance ministry wants this proposal to come through, said officials. 																								The infusion of capital into the SBI has become necessary to meet the new, stringent capital adequacy norms under Basel II. At the end of the exercise, the government will continue to hold the same stake in the bank.																								In the past, the SBI had said it was exploring three to four options to raise funds, including a rights issue, a public offer and a preferential share sale. In October, bank officials had also said an equity issue could dilute the governments stake by 2.5 to 3 per cent.																								SBI officials held a meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram today but they said the proposal had been cleared some days back. 																								Chidambaram told reporters after the meeting, I have heard the State Bank of Indias request for capital and I said yes. The government will find a way to provide further capital. 																								Officials said the SBI board would decide on the rights share ratio and price.																								Banking sources said it was possible the issue would be in the ratio of one rights share for every two shares held. They also said it was expected to be at a discount to the average of three months market price for SBI shares. The SBI stock closed at Rs 2,346.15 on the BSE today.																								Officials said after the rights issue, the government could look at plans to merge the SBI with its four unlisted subsidiaries  the State Bank of Hyderabad, the State Bank of Indore, the State Bank of Patiala and the State Bank of Saurashtra. The government may merge these banks into the SBI, allowing the listed subsidiaries  the State Bank of Bikaner amp; Jaipur, the State Bank of Travancore and the State Bank of Mysore  to remain as stand-alone banks.																								The government has long been looking at the possibility of either merging the SBIs subsidiaries with it or creating an SBI-II by merging the seven subsidiaries into a separate mega-bank.

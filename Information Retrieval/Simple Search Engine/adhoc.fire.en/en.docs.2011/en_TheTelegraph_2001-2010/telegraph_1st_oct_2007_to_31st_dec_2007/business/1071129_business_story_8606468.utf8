				 Court to hear DCM case today
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: HB Stockholdings today moved Delhi High Court against the Company Law Boards decision on the DCM Shriram warrant case.																								The board had refused to stay the plans of the promoters of DCM Shriram Industries Limited to issue preferential warrants to themselves.																								The court has listed the matter for hearing tomorrow.																								Delhi-based HB Stockholdings, promoted by Harish Bhasin, had opposed the issue before the board on the grounds of the issue being detrimental to the interests of minority shareholders of DCM Shriram.																								HB Stockholdings holds 14.54 per cent in DCM Shriram and has made an open offer for another 22.88 per cent of the sugar maker at Rs 70 per share.																								The promoters hold 32.54 per cent in DCM Shriram.																								Shareholders of the company are voting via a postal ballot on whether they will allow the promoters to issue warrants.																								The board will meet on Friday to decide on the warrants based on shareholder votes.																								In October, the DCM Shriram board had passed a resolution allowing the promoters to allot 7 lakh warrants to themselves under which each warrant will be converted into three shares at different points of time over the next 18 months.

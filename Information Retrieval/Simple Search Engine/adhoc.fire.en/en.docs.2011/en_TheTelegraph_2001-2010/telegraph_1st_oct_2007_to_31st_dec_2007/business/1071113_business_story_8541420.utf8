				 US subsidy policy on steel draws flak
																								New York, Nov. 12 (PTI): A group representing international steel exporters, importers and consumers has accused the US steelmakers of deriving unfair benefits from subsidies.																								The US steel industry has gained about $17 billion in various subsidies over the past seven years and continues to win favourable trade decisions restricting imports, even though demand outpaces domestic supply, a report by the American Institute for International Steel said.																								In recent decisions, the US International Trade Commission has agreed to renew duties on steel from India, China, Japan and Brazil.																								Last month, the trade commission denied a request by six countries to end duties on import of hot-rolled steel.																								The study, the Wall Street journal said, marks a ratcheting up in the war of words between the US steelmakers and their rivals.																								The decisions come as several duties and tariffs on imported steel were put up for review, five years after they were imposed in the wake of a wave of bankruptcy filings among the US steelmakers from 2000 through 2003, the journal said.																								Those reviews, it noted, so far were generally favouring the US producers. 																								Since 2004, the commission has eliminated duties on steel imported from 20 smaller producers such as Sweden, Romania and Kazakhstan. But it has kept the duties in place for 17 larger steel-producing countries. 																								The US steelmakers argue that dumping by the biggest steel-producing countries will resume if the duties are lifted.

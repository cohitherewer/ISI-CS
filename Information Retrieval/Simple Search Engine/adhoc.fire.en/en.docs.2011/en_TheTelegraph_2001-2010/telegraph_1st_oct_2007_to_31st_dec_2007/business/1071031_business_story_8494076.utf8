				 War of words over economic policy
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 				 Paulson and Chidambaram: Dialogue with differences 																								New Delhi, Oct. 30: India and the US are developing closer ties, but neither country likes to be advised by the other on economic policy.																								Speaking at a business conclave organised by the Fortune magazine, finance minister P. Chidambaram said today, I came to the conclusion that perhaps one of the reasons why the sub-prime mortgage crisis hit the US economy was because regulations fell behind innovation.																								We dont want (our) regulations to fall behind innovations. 																								US secretary for treasury Henry Paulson yesterday spoke of the need to lift restrictions on capital flows stating they lead to distortions. 																								Paulsons comments were seen as a direct criticism of recent RBI moves to curb anonymous foreign investors from participating in the stock market. 																								Global investors fears about the US economy made them shovel cash into the Indian and other developing stock markets, propelling them to record highs, which have led to fears of a bubble. 																								India has seen foreign institutional investments surge to $17 billion this year. 																								In October alone, FIIs have pumped in nearly $8 billion. 																								The inflows soared after the US Federal Reserve cut a key rate on September 18.																								In 1990, India had disregarded the Wests advice on making the rupee fully convertible. 																								A currency crisis in East Asia in 1997, however, saw analysts in the West and central bank chiefs praising Indias more cautious currency control policies. 																								If India is ignoring the US advice on capital flows, Paulson also seemed to reject Indias advice on the need to regulate innovation in capital markets.																								He said innovation was desirable and a contributor to growth in the US economy, though it was behind the sub-prime crisis.																								However, Indian officials support Paulsons views on greater foreign investments in banking, insurance and pension segments. 																								North Block officials said, We have been and we will walk down the path of reforms ... but we have to chose our own timing for opening up and that will depend not only on the economic situation but also on domestic real politics.																								The Left opposition to greater voting rights for foreign entities in banks and higher overseas investment in insurance is expected to delay reform in these sectors.

				 Three options on crude comfort
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Oils well																								New Delhi, Nov. 2: The Union government is likely to come out with a solution next week to mitigate the woes of oil marketing companies charred by the flare-up in global crude prices.																								There are three options before the government: raise petrol and diesel prices, reduce taxes and issue fresh bonds to state-owned oil marketing companies.																								It is also open to a mix of these options.																								As the price of US crude touched an all-time high of $96.24 on Thursday, petroleum minister Murli Deora met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the second day today. Deora also held consultations with Congress president Sonia Gandhi.																								We hope to find a solution next week, Deora told reporters after his meeting with the Prime Minister. We will do all that is possible to protect the interests of our PSUs.																								Any move to protect the health of the marketing companies without raising prices will hit the governments deficit management plans.																								On the other hand, if the government raises prices, there are fears of an electoral backlash, especially with the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly polls round the corner.																								Deoras meeting with Sonia points to the governments unwillingness to take any decision in haste because of the polls. The two leaders were believed to have discussed the fallout of a marginal hike in the prices of petrol and diesel, which have not been revised for eight months.																								A decision may take two-three days. I cannot say that prices will not be increased, Deora said.																								The oil marketing companies are reporting a loss of Rs 240 crore daily on their revenues from the sale of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene at prices that are lower than costs. They are losing Rs 3.90 a litre on petrol, Rs 6.22 on diesel, Rs 15.99 on kerosene and Rs 174.17 on every 14.2-kg of LPG cylinder.																								Comparative picture																								Among South Asian countries, the prices of cooking fuel  kerosene and LPG  are the lowest in India.																								PDS kerosene price in ration shops of Rs 9.09 a litre in Delhi is lower than Rs 30.89 per litre charged for the cooking fuel in Nepal and Rs 22.91 a litre in Bangladesh, according to latest data.																								Pakistan sells kerosene to its masses at Rs 22.81 a litre and Sri Lanka, Rs 24.10 per litre.																								LPG is sold at artificially lower rates of Rs 294.75 per cylinder in Delhi compared with Rs 663.68 per cylinder in Nepal and Rs 390.39 in Bangladesh.																								However, petrol and diesel are priced at rates that are the second highest in the region.

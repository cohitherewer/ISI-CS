				 Daimler set to shift truck gear
 GARIMA SINGH NEOGY				 	 Lots On offer																								New Delhi, Oct. 2: DaimlerChrysler India is working on a strategy to enter the medium commercial vehicle segment.																								We have a portfolio of products in our global stable for medium commercial vehicles. The company may in the future exercise these options. It will be a natural extension for us considering that India is a growing market, company sources said.

The sources said the company was exploring the possibility of introducing a model of Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation. 																								Mitsubishi Fuso sells the Fuso Fighter, a medium commercial vehicle. Mitsubishi Fuso is now controlled by DaimlerChrysler.																								We are keen to have a greater engagement in the commercial vehicle segment. We are talking to different players to understand the market and form synergies, said Wilfried Aulbur, managing director and CEO of DaimlerChrysler India.																								The company will start manufacturing Mercedez Benz luxury buses from next year. 																								The first bus will be an inter-city coach that will compete with Volvo. 																								A new line has been installed at the Chikhali plant where the buses will be assembled. 																								The bus bodies will be built at Sutlej Motors in Jalandhar.																								DaimlerChrysler reported a 22 per cent rise in sales in India at 1,681 units between January and August this year.

The investment in this facility will be around Rs 250 crore and it is expected to go on stream by 2009.																								The plant will produce 5,000 passenger cars annually against 4,000 units at its existing facility.

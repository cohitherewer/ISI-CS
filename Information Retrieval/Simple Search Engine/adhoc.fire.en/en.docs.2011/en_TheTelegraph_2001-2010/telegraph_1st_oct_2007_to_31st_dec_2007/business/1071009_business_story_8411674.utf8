				 Reliance seeks 3-year drilling holiday
																								New Delhi, Oct. 8 (PTI): Reliance Industries Ltd has sought a three-year drilling holiday from exploring nine deep-sea blocks it had won in Nelp auctions, saying it has been hit by the acute paucity in the supply of drilling rigs all over the world.																								Global scarcity (of deepwater drilling rigs) has had a significant impact on RILs drilling operations, RIL chief executive (petroleum) P.M.S. Prasad wrote to the oil secretary last month.																								Prasad said oil regulator DGHs policy of merging exploration phases to tide over shortage of drilling rigs was inadequate.																								Merging of exploration phases proposes only a short term solution as it amasses the work commitment into the second and fourth phase and does not provide respite to the contractor over the long term, he said.																								RIL has committed to drill 73 wells in the three Nelp-I blocks, five Nelp-III blocks and one pre-Nelp block, requiring more than 12 dig years to accomplish the programme. Against this, it has two deep water rigs  C Kirk Rhine and Deep Water Frontier.																								It had contracted three more rigs  Expedition, D534 and Neptune for mobilisation by June 2006, August 2006 and January 2007 respectively, with an additional rig Blackford Dolphin slated to join the fleet in October 2007.																								Unfortunately, despite having executed the required contracts, which are always subject to availability, the rigs are still not being made available to RIL, Prasad said.																								While D534 is expected to reach RIL in November, expedition would not be there before October 2008 and Neptune and Blackford Dolphin would not come before May 2008. 																								The planned rig hiring/deployment schedule is constantly under deferment because of delays in bringing the contracted rigs to India, because the rig operators are fulfilling their spillover commitments in previous deployment campaigns, Prasad said. The delays have made it extremely difficult for RIL to complete the work on time, he added.																								He cited the example of pre-Nelp block GK-OSJ-3, where RIL faced inordinate delays.

				 Safety rules for mobile banking to be in place
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 19: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today proposed to come out with a regulatory and oversight framework for mobile banking. 																								With transactions through mobile phones set to rise in the near future, the Reserve Bank is concerned about the safety of such a system.																								The draft of the central banks Financial Sector Technology Vision 2008-10 said, Efforts would be channelised to provide for standards for such systems.																								The document, on which the RBI has invited public comments within a month, added that large-scale spread of mobile telephony has opened up new vistas.																								Adequate steps to ensure safety and security in a mobile based computing/communicating environment have to be, however, made, it added.																								Bank licence																								A technical paper released today by the RBI suggested that differentiated bank licensing, a practice followed in developed countries, should not be introduced immediately. 																								Differentiated bank licence is a system in which licences are given on the basis of a banks core activity. 																								For instance, a bank may opt for wholesale banking licence to focus entirely on the corporate sector. Such banks will, therefore, not have to go through the rigours of accepting retail deposits, providing no frills facility to the economically disadvantaged or meeting priority sector norms.																								The technical paper said that the central bank should continue with the existing system and in the interest of financial inclusion, it was necessary that all banks should offer certain minimum services to all customers.

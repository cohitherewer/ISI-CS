																								Mumbai, Dec. 28: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today announced guidelines for real estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate investment companies. These rules are expected to benefit investors who want to cash in on the real estate boom in the country.
																								According to Sebi, only those applicants will be permitted to form such trusts which have a net worth of at least Rs 5 crore. Applicants with a net worth of Rs 3 crore will also be allowed to apply but they will have to increase it to Rs 5 crore within three years from the registration date.
																								REITs are companies that buy, sell, manage and develop real estate assets. Like mutual funds, such trusts raise money from investors and institutions and invest them in real estate projects. 
																								Anyone interested in the real estate market can just buy units or shares offered by such a trust. This entitles persons to a share of the income generated by the REIT from its property investments.
																								Small investors who find it difficult to buy property could find such trusts attractive. 
																								Trustees or entities that can form REITs are scheduled banks engaged in commercial activity or a trust company which is a subsidiary of such a bank, a public financial institution, an insurance company and a corporate body.
																								Schemes can only be launched by a trust after getting rated by a credit agency. 
																								REIT schemes will be permitted to provide only an indicative return based on market conditions and the trusts expertise. No scheme will be open for subscription for more than 90 days.
																								The market regulator has also asked such trusts to specify the minimum and the maximum subscription amount they seek to raise under the scheme in offer documents and issue transferable unit certificates to applicants within six weeks. 
																								REIT schemes will be allowed to invest only in those real estate assets which are generating income at present.
																								Also, trustees, directors and key personnel of real estate investment trusts will have to conform to criteria laid down in the Sebi (criteria for fit and proper person) regulations. 
																								The trust will be required to file a copy of the offer document with Sebi along with the prescribed fee before launching any scheme.

 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 S.C. Gupta in Calcutta on Thursday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Nov. 22: Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL) is planning a separate company for exploration and prospecting activities.																								The company is present in all categories of copper business  from mining to beneficiation, smelting, refining and the casting of refined copper metal into downstream products.																								HCL chairman S.C. Gupta said, We have applied for exploration and prospecting licences along with others for 5-6 blocks. If we get a licence, we would like to take up the business through a joint venture. 																								He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a mining seminar organised by the Australian Trade Commission here today.																								According to Gupta, HCL is looking for mining opportunities in other metals such as gold. We dont have enough expertise in mineral exploration and prospecting. But we can partner someone else who has got the expertise. 																								The company is weighing the possibility of developing its unexplored copper mine at Chapri Sideswar, Jharkhand, through a joint venture at an investment of Rs 600 crore. 																								Chapri has reserves of 80 million tonnes, and the company has applied for a lease to mine the copper.

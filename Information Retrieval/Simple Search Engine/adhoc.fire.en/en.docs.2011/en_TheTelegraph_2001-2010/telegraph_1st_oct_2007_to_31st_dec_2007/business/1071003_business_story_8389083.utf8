				 Foreigners eye Tata plantation stake
																								London, Oct. 2 (PTI): A number of foreign investors are in talks to pick up a significant stake in the Tata groups tea plantation business, a senior group official said here.																								According to a tentative restructuring proposal, which is subject to the approval of Calcutta High Court, Tata Tea would retain a 20 per cent stake in its north Indian plantation operations. Another 20 per cent would go to other investors such as IL amp;FS and IFCI, said L. Krishna Kumar, who is group CFO of Tetley, the UK-based unit of Tata Tea.																								Around 10 per cent stake can be sold to non-resident companies or investors and Tata Investment will own about 10 per cent. Around 15-20 per cent can be given to workers at the operations, Kumar said.																								Tata Tea had acquired Tetley in 2000, which has since become the worlds second largest tea bag brand.																								Talks are on with a number of overseas investors for the 20 per cent stake, but they are at an early stage, he said, but declined to reveal the identities of the parties concerned.																								In August, at a Tata Tea AGM in Mumbai, group chief Ratan Tata had said about 37,000 employees of the Tata-held tea gardens in Bengal and Assam would be moving over to the new entity, Amalgamated Plantations Pvt Ltd. It was being created in accordance with Tata Teas restructuring plans to come out of the plantation business. 																								Kumar said plantation was not a key business for either Tata Tea or Tetley. We are also working on a model where we can use the land for both tea plantation and other crops, he added.

				 Japanese trio line up sports bikes
 GARIMA SINGH NEOGY				 	 Wheels of fire																								New Delhi, Sept. 30: The fast and the furious in motorcycles are ready to burn the rubber.																								Yamaha, Suzuki and Honda of Japan are planning to launch high-end bikes in the country.																								Yamaha Motor India, facing the heat from domestic competitors such as Hero Honda, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motors, is attempting a turnaround by launching its sports bikes  the 1,000cc MT01 and 1,600cc YZF R1  by November this year. 																								They are likely to be priced at Rs 8-10 lakh, considering the 113 per cent import duty on completely built motorbikes. 																								We look forward to selling around 50 units in the first few months of the launch, Yamaha Motor India managing director Tomotaka Ishikawa told The Telegraph. 																								Yamahas nearest competitor is Royal Enfield, which has revamped the 500cc Bullet Machismo. 																								The Machismo costs a little over Rs 1 lakh, but does not match Yamahas product in technology, auto analysts said.																								There is, however, a considerable demand for the Royal Enfield bike. The waiting period is about a month.																								We have been selling about 100 units a month but we can sell much more  the demand is almost double, said a company official.																								According to Ishikawa, Yamaha plans to launch more such bikes. However, the success of the models will depend on the extent to which they win converts from other models, cost structure and the regulatory environment.																								Companies are now more serious about their plans for big bikes after India recently allowed imports under the Euro III standards. Imports were not permitted in the absence of regulations for engines more powerful than 500cc. 																								Suzuki Motor India Ltd is also planning to import Hayabusa and its GSX range of superbikes. 																								It aims to import the GSX-1000 sometime next year. 																								Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India (HMSI) is looking at importing its cult models, the CBR 1000 and the GLX 1800. 																								HMSIs president and CEO Shinji Aayoma had earlier said, It is little difficult to sell high-end bikes in India given the countrys duty structure. The retail price will be at least three times the base price. But in the near future, we hope to see some change.																								Domestic players are not too far behind in the race of big bikes. Bajaj Auto recently said it was close to finalising its partnership with its long-time technical partner Kawasaki to enter the 500cc segment.

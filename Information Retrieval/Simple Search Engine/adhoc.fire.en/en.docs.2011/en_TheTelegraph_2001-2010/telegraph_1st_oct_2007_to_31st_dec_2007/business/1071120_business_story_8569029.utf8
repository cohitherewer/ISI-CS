				 ICICI boss draws a rising rupee curve
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Kamath: Looking ahead																								Mumbai, Nov. 19: Industry will have to brace for a harder rupee  and more jobs could be at stake.																								ICICI CEO and managing director K.V. Kamath reckons the Indian currency will appreciate at least one rupee to the dollar every year from here on.																								On Monday, the rupee closed at 39.35 to the dollar against Fridays close of 39.32, on expectations of higher capital inflows into the booming stock markets.																								The dollar has been weakening against almost all currencies, including the rupee, for quite some time now, said Kamath. It will be appropriate for the dollar-sensitive companies to plan for a strong rupee.																								Addressing the sixth manufacturing summit of the Confederation of Indian Industry here today, Kamath said companies with large export revenues would have to improve their treasury operations as this would play a crucial role in making businesses more viable in the long run.																								Sources said almost 29,000 exporters in India had shed jobs on account of the rising rupee. According to industry estimates, another 2 lakh jobs in India will be on the line if the rupee continues to harden.																								We have visited more than 82 locations in India that have been hurt by the appreciating rupee. Garments, marine and handicraft are the worst hit sectors. We will see a huge job loss if the rupee continues to harden, said commerce secretary G.K. Pillai. 																								China is likely to cut interest rates. Therefore, we can expect a rise in capital inflows in December. This will help keep inflation at moderate levels and allow more cushioning on the rising oil prices. But most importantly, the rising rupee will lead to a further cut in interest rates by at least 25 basis points in January, said Amitabh Chakraborty, president (equity), Religare Enterprises. 																								The partially convertible rupee touched its 9-year high at 39.32 per dollar on November 1.

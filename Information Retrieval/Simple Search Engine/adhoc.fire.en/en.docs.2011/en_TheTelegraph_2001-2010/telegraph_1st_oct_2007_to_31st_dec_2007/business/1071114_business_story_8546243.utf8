				 SAIL seeks entire Chiria ore for itself
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY			LION rsquo;S SHARE		New Delhi, Nov. 13: Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) will not cede control over the Chiria mines.																								The steel ministry has written to the Prime Ministers Office to communicate SAILs position to the Jharkhand government.																								Many steel companies, including ArcelorMittal, are keen on acquiring a slice of Chiria. Analysts say Chiria, with reserves of 2 billion tonnes, has Asias largest deposit of good-quality iron ore. 																								In the letter to the PMO, the ministry stated that it was not possible for SAIL to give up some of its rights on Chiria because the company needed the ore from the mines for its expansion plans, according to top steel ministry officials.																								SAIL is planning to ramp up capacity at its Bokaro plant and IISCO Steel Plant in Burnpur. It is also setting up a 12-million-tonne greenfield plant at Manoharpur, Jharkhand.																								A total of over 32.5mt of steel-making capacity will come up at these three locations, requiring SAIL to ramp up iron ore production at Chiria alone to 25mt. 																								The Jharkhand government had earlier asked SAIL to keep with it only so much of Chiria as was necessary for IISCO and its steel plants in the state. 																								SAIL had earlier thought of taking ore mining capacity at Chiria to 7.5mt at a cost of Rs 1,800 crore or so. It has now indicated to take the mining capacity to 15mt in the first phase and then to 25mt in the second phase, officials said. 																								The officials said the Jharkhand government, too, seemed to have accepted SAILs claim on Chiria and had refrained from trying to award any part of the mines to private players. 																								Jharkhand has granted mining rights to rival steel makers such as Jindal, Essar and Bhushan Steel without disturbing the lease areas of Chiria.

				 Technology emerges winner
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 17: Technology stocks bucked the rout on the markets today on the back of the depreciation of the rupee.																								TCS gained 3.7 per cent to Rs 1,108, Satyam Computer Services 1.2 per cent to Rs 455.10 and Infosys 1.16 per cent to Rs 1,889.90. The sectoral index was up 0.3 per cent.																								Sumeet Budhiraja of First Global Securities said, As the rupee continues to weaken, the technology firms will perform better. 																								According to analysts, a one per cent rise in the value of the rupee reduces the operating margins of software companies by 30 to 50 basis points.																								Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president of Karvy Stock Broking, said: Most investors were light on the IT sector. So when the market fell, they did not immediately sell the stocks. Moreover, the move on P-notes made sure that the dollar flow was muted, which led to the depreciation of the rupee. This gave the tech sector the boost.

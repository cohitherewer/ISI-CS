 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Deora: Strong move																								New Delhi, Oct. 11: The government will issue oil bonds worth Rs 23,457 crore to keep petrol and diesel prices in control. 																								This decision was taken at a Union cabinet meeting today. 																								The bonds will be issued to public sector oil marketing companies as compensation for selling petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG at a loss. 																								Oil minister Murli Deora said, We have kept our promise of not raising prices of sensitive petroleum products. 																								Officials said unless the global crude market was badly hit in the winter, the government was unlikely to raise prices.																								The bonds will enable the oil companies to bridge about 43 per cent of their deficit from selling the four petroleum products at a loss.																								The cabinet also decided that subsidies on LPG and kerosene would continue till March 31, 2010. In 2002, the government had decided to phase out the subsidies by 2005. The deadline was later extended to March 31, 2007. 																								Petroleum secretary M. S. Srinivasan said the first lot of oil bonds, worth Rs 12,000 crore, would be issued by next week. This relief is for the losses suffered by the companies  the Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation  in the first half of this fiscal.																								Revenue losses to the companies for selling the petroleum products below cost price are about Rs 55,000 crore.																								Bharat Yantra																								The government will wind up Allahabad-based Bharat Yantra Nigam, a sick PSU engineering company, on the recommendation of the BIFR.																								The employees who want to opt for an early separation before the closure of the company would be offered a voluntary retirement scheme, said information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.

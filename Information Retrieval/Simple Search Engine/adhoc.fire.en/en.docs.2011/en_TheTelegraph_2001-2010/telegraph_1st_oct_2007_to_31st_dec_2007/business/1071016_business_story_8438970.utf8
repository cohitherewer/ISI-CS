				 Uco Bank gears up for Rs 50cr float
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 S.K. Goel in Calcutta on Monday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, Oct. 15: Uco Bank may come out with a public issue of Rs 50 crore in February next year. The bank expects to rake in around Rs 200-250 crore by selling the shares at a premium.																								The premium will be determined by the market condition at the time of the offering, which will be some time in February next year. We are confident that we will be able to raise Rs 200-250 crore from the issue, said S.K. Goel, chairman of the Calcutta-based public sector bank. 																								The government is also likely to approve the banks capital restructuring proposal. I had a discussion with the finance ministry on this. The ministry has given its in-principle nod and the proposal is now awaiting the approvals of the finance minister and the Union cabinet, Goel said, adding that a formal go-ahead was expected in a month. 																								The restructuring will bring down the governments equity holding in the bank to 59.9 per cent. 																								After this, the bank plans to tap the capital market with fresh equity issues in phases. 																								Any premium to the share price in the public issue will accrue to the banks reserves and surpluses, forming a part of its Tier I capital requirement. At the end of June this year, the banks equity capital was Rs 799.36 crore, in which the governments share was 74.98 per cent. 																								Net profit																								The bank today announced a 50.06 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 243 crore for the first six months of the current financial year. 																								For the quarter ended September 30, 2007, the bank posted a net profit of Rs 111 crore against Rs 101 crore in the year-ago period. 																								The total business in the first half of the current fiscal grew to Rs 11,7994 crore from Rs 11,2331 crore on March 31, 2007.

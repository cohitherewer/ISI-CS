				 Tata Teleservices to offer GSM
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Fresh call																								New Delhi, Oct. 22: CDMA operator Tata Teleservices also wants to join the GSM bandwagon. 																								The government has allowed telecom firms to provide services under both technologies  code division multiple access (CDMA) and global system for mobile (GSM) communications  and Tata Teleservices is the second CDMA company after Reliance Communications to propose to offer GSM services.																								The company today sought permission from the department of telecom (DoT) to offer GSM-based mobile services across the country under its unified access services licence.																								A Tata Teleservices spokesperson said, We look forward to a level-playing field in the industry and await clarity on all aspects of this new announcement from the authorities. 																								Tata Teleservices has applied for GSM spectrum under new DoT guidelines, which allow existing licensees to use spectrum and offer services in both CDMA and GSM technologies. Anil Ambanis R-Com has already received the governments approval for its GSM plans. Single-circle CDMA operators Shyam Telelink and HFCL have been allowed to offer GSM services in Rajasthan and Punjab, respectively. GSM-based mobile connections have been growing at a faster pace compared with CDMA.																								COAI protest																								The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) will approach Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) tomorrow to protest the governments new telecom policy, which they say, has twisted rules to benefit one operator.																								The petition is ready, a Coai official said, adding: We shall be waiting for TDSAT to open tomorrow to file our petition opposing new rules in the telecom sector  allowing CDMA players to start GSM mobile services and increasing subscriber limit for additional spectrum.

				 Air India loan rejig to cut cost
 ANIRUDH LASKAR 																								Mumbai, Nov. 28: Air India is planning to trim its interest costs on the loans it has raised to pay for the planes it has ordered to replace its ageing fleet.																								The state-owned airline, which has refinanced its loans, is mulling the option of switching from a floating rate to a fixed rate of interest. 																								However, that will happen only when the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (Libor)  a key rate-setting benchmark for international loans  eases to a level between 4.25 and 4.5 per cent. At present, the six-month Libor is ruling at 4.86 per cent.																								The airline, which has just reported a loss of Rs 447.93 crore for the year ended March 2007, has placed orders for 68 Boeings over the next 17 years. Fifteen planes have already been delivered. 																								The planes that have been ordered include 18 Boeing 737s for Air India Express, eight Boeing 777-200 LR, 15 Boeing 777-300 ER for non-stop long-haul operations and 27 Boeing 787 Dreamliners for which deliveries start next year.																								The company has estimated the total acquisition cost at Rs 35,000 crore.																								The company has so far paid about Rs 7,100 crore to Boeing towards acquisition of B-777, B-737-800, and as pre-delivery payment for 787 aircraft acquisition programme. 																								Part of the funds have been refinanced through US Exim loan  85 per cent of which has been raised at sub-Libor rates and the remaining 15 per cent at spreads above Libor. The airline is seriously contemplating converting a portion of its exposure from floating rates to fixed rates when the Libor drops, an Air India official said.																								Much will depend on the US Federal Reserves meeting on December 11 when Ben Bernanke and his coven mull ways to head off a looming threat of recession in the US. If the Fed cuts rates, Air India may just get the chance to hedge its interest costs.																								Interest costs  which rose to Rs 239 crore in the last fiscal  had badly dented profitability of the airline which was already struggling under the burden of rising aviation fuel costs.																								The airline will be able to save Rs 90 crore to Rs 120 crore or 0.3 to 0.5 per cent on the overall interest if the Libor comes down to 4.5 per cent. This means that the company will then have to pay an interest of 5.5 to 6 per cent in rupee terms, said an aviation analyst at BNP Paribas.

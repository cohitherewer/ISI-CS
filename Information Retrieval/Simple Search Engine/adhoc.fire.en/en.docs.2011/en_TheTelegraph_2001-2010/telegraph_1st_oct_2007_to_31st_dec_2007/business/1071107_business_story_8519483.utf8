				 Sumitomo, Stone in deal
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 6: Stone India Ltd has inked a technical collaboration agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries of Japan to manufacture air springs for rail coaches.																								Air springs enable the use of pneumatic suspension in coaches instead of mechanical suspension. This will lead to greater passenger comfort in trains running at high speed. 																								Indian Railways, which adds more than 2,800 coaches every year, will use this technology for future production and selectively upgrade its rolling stock of about 25,000 coaches.																								Sumitomo Electrical Industries is a leading supplier of coaches to Shinaksen, the Japanese bullet train, as well as other world markets. 																								Stone India is a GP Goenka group firm. The company expects to increase its turnover to Rs 300 crore from Rs 130 crore in the next two to three years. 																								The company, which now has two plants  one at Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and another near Calcutta  is planning another unit in Hyderabad at an investment of Rs 50 crore. The plant will manufacture electronic components of power products. 																								Once this plant goes on stream, the Baddi unit will supply exclusively to Indian Railways, while the Calcutta plant will be for exports. The Hyderabad facility will manufacture electronic products, Goenka said.																								Stone India manufactures train lighting alternators, collection systems and pantographs for electric locomotives and electrical multiple units and air and vaccum brake systems for passenger coaches, among others. 																								Goenka said the rails decision of retrofitting air dryers for diesel and electric locomotives and manufacturing high-speed coaches would generate good business opportunities for the company. The aim is to become a complete railway solutions company which manufactures every component, he added.																								In the next two years, Stone India is expected to garner Rs 30 crore from exports.

				 Maruti to unveil concept car
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 INNOVATIONS																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: Maruti Suzuki will showcase the A-Star, a concept car built on the Swift and SX4 platform, at the Delhi Auto Expo in January. 																								While compact cars are normally simple and elegant in design, the Concept A-Star will also be sporty, sources said. The car will have a predominant European character but there will be subtle cues from Indian tradition in its outlines, the official added.																								A concept car or show car is a prototype made to showcase a new concept, which may or may not reach production platforms. 																								However, sources said, Suzukis A-Star  developed jointly by Maruti Suzuki and Suzuki Motor Corporation  will culminate in a production model.																								The Concept A-Star is the precursor to Maruti Suzukis global compact car that will be launched soon, company officials said. The global compact car, which will be manufactured at Maruti Suzukis plant in Manesar for export to Europe, will also be sold in India.																								In this calendar year, compact car sales have grown by nearly 20 per cent, while overall sales have witnessed a 15 per cent increase.																								To meet increased production demands, capacity is being raised at Marutis Manesar manufacturing unit, which will make 300,000 units by 2010. More than 80,000-100,000 units of the new car will be exported to Suzuki Europe and 50,000 units will be supplied to Nissan under a contract manufacturing agreement.																								Maruti Suzuki India also has plans to invest $1.8 billion in the next four to five years to set up a research and development unit at Manesar and enhance marketing and production capabilities.

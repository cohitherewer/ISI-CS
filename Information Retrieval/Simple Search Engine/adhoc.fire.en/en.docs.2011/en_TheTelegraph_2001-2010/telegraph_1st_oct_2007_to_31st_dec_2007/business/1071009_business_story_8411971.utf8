Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Oct. 8: Multi-commodity trading firm MMTC Ltd plans to diversify into retail and special economic zones (SEZs).																								The PSU major will form separate companies for these businesses. It is already searching for private partners.																								The company has floated expressions of interest to select a joint venture partner for its retail foray, and three companies are keen to join hands. MMTC will have a 26 per cent stake in the entity.																								MMTC officials didnt give the details, but it is learnt that Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Retail is in the fray.																								MMTC is the largest importer of gold. It imports 150 tonnes of the national demand for 700 tonnes .																								We are already into jewellery retailing through two self-owned shops and franchisees. But this will be a new venture and a brand. We plan to have 50-60 outlets in the next three years, Asheesh Majumdar, chief general manager of MMTC, said here today.																								Tatas Tanishque and Gitanjali Gems are two of the leading jewellery retailers in India but the space is getting bigger with new entrants such as Reliance and Future Group wanting to cash in on the huge demand for gold and diamond.																								MMTC also wants to set up a gold refinery.																								The company has shortlisted two foreign entities who will partner MMTC in this venture. The refining unit will also make medallions to cater to the growing trend of investing in physical gold.																								The board is meeting later this month. It may take a decision then, a company official informed. The refinery and medallion unit will involve an investment of Rs 100 crore.																								In search of land																								MMTC is looking for 75-100 acres to set up a jewellery SEZ. It has held discussions with the Bengal and Karnataka government.																								The land has to be close to the airport to minimise the risk of carrying the metal by road. 																								Wherever it comes up, the state government will be a partner in the project, apart from other parties, an official said.																								The company has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to search for a location. PwC will submit its report by the end of November.																								Mining 																								The trading PSU is planning a tieup with state-owned National Mineral Development Corporation Ltd to hunt for gold and diamond mines abroad. It is eyeing countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in the Commonwealth of Independent States for gold and African countries such as Angola and Botswana for diamond.																								MMTC has posted a 42 per cent growth in turnover at Rs 23,302 crore in 2006-07 It reported a net profit of Rs 127 crore.

				 PCO charm offensive to break mobile spell
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Gearing up																								Mumbai, Nov. 26: Battered by the onslaught of the mobile phone, the humble PCO is beginning to fight back.																								Come 2008 and your neighbourhood PCO (public call office) will offer multiple services such as banking, payment of utility bills and insurance premia, and digital mobile recharge through their own servers.																								We want to convert the PCO operator into a multiple system operator who will offer banking and courier services, accept insurance premium and offer a payment window for telephone and electricity bills. This is in line with the RBIs directive to banks to appoint banking correspondents  a role that the PCOs are well equipped to play, said Sharad Agarwal, chief technology officer of Atom Technologies, a subsidiary of Financial Technologies. 																								Atom is providing technical support to Indian PCO Teleservices Ltd (IPTL), the corporate entity formed by the Indian Payphone Welfare Association for the venture.																								IPTL has already tied up with BSNL for digital prepaid recharge. It is now in talks with HDFC Bank and Corporation Bank to offer a range of banking services that will roll out in January 2008, said officials.																								Talks are also on for a tie-up with Tata Indicom for digital recharge.																								Out of the four million PCOs in the country, about 3.5 million have turned into small kiosks selling other products as revenues have tumbled because of the mobile revolution and the slump in phone call rates. This leaves about five lakh stand-alone PCOs, many of which are on verge of closure. We plan to start with these and link them to our network, said Rajneesh Ranjan, director of IPTL. 																								While opening a bank account, the customer will pay money to the PCO operator along with his details and relevant documents. In return, the operator will issue a smartcard along with a money receipt for the transaction. He will punch a landline number and the server will transfer the money into the new account. The operator will send the depositors details and documents to the bank for certification. 																								For the illiterate, there will also be a voice intimation over the phone informing them about the balance in their bank account.																								While effecting a money transfer to another account in a PCO in another state, the PCO operator will take a picture of the depositor and feed the code of the receiver PCO into the server. The receiving PCO will also take a picture of the receiver person to keep a record. 																								It is not possible for banks to open ATMs or branches everywhere. The idea is to make the PCO function as a human ATM. For this purpose, the PCO will have a collateral of Rs 10,000 with the bank concerned, said Yogesh Kochhar of Tata Indicom, who is an adviser to the project. 																								Its a welcome development. It was getting very difficult to sustain stand-alone PCOs. Hopefully, corporatisation will breathe new life into these outfits, said N.K. Gupta, chairman of STD Booth Owners Association in Calcutta. 																								ITPL is also in talks with Tata AIG for the insurance tie -up and several state electricity bodies for bill collection.

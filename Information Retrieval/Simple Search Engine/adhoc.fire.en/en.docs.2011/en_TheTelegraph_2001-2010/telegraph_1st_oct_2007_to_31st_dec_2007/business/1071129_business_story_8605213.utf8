				 Panel okays dual GST model
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dasgupta: New regime																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: The empowered committee of state finance ministers today approved the introduction of a combined goods and services tax (GST) both at the federal and state levels.																								The empowered committee has accepted the report on GST submitted by the joint working group. The committee will recommend the adoption of dual GST to the central government, said Asim Dasgupta, chairman of the empowered committee and finance minister of Bengal. 																								Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh has decided to switch to the value-added tax (VAT) regime  a move that will complete the countrys biggest tax-reform exercise aimed at doing away with multiple levies in states and Union territories. 																								The Uttar Pradesh government has taken a decision to introduce VAT. They have already sent their draft legislation for presidential assent through the Union finance ministry, said Dasgupta. 																								Uttar Pradesh had not implemented VAT, citing lack of clarity. Under the dual GST model, to be effective from April 2010, there could be more than four rates of taxes on goods and services. For example, there will be one or more tax on goods, but one rate for services at the central level. Similarly, there will be one or more tax on goods, but one rate on services at the state level. 																								The GST by central and state governments will be on the entire chain of production. The Centre and the states will give tax credit to companies on the input tax levied by them separately.																								The working group on GST, constituted in May this year, included central government and state government officials. In 2004, finance minister P. Chidambaram proposed a national GST by merging all levies on goods and services from 2010. 																								Another round of discussion will be held on December 20 after state finance ministers submit their views in writing. We will finalise the GST report on December 20, and send it to the central government by December-end, Dasgupta said.																								It will be ensured that there is no double taxation after the GST implementation from April 1, 2010, Dasgupta added.

				 Banks tweak deposit rates
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 CHAIN REACTION																								Mumbai, Nov. 1: The State Bank of India (SBI) today increased fixed deposit rates on select maturities, while the Centurion Bank of Punjab (CBoP) lowered deposit rates by 25-50 basis points. 																								Only two days back, the Reserve Bank had increased the cash reserve ratio (CRR)  the proportion of deposits that banks have to keep in reserve  by 50 basis points to 7.5 per cent. The decision was expected to absorb Rs 16,000 crore from the banking system.																								Over the next few days, more banks could bring down their deposit rates. 																								After the mid-term credit policy review, banks had said they had no plans to increase interest rates on loans. However, deposit rates will be lowered to take care of the margins that will be under pressure because of the hike in CRR.																								The State Bank has left interest rates on most of its maturities unchanged. 																								However, fixed deposits of one year to 550 days will attract interest at 8.75 per cent against 8 per cent earlier.																								For senior citizens, fixed deposits of the above tenure will be paid interest at 9.25 per cent, an increase of 75 basis points. The new rate will come into effect from November 7.																								This is the highest interest rate offered by the SBI across all tenures in normal term deposit schemes.																								CBoP has revised deposit rates in two maturities with effect from November 5. The interest rate on deposits for a term of one year and above to two years has been reduced from 8.50 per cent to 8 per cent. For a term of 13 months and 15 days, the rate has been reduced from 9.25 per cent to 9 per cent. The revision was in line with the trends in the market, the bank said. 																								The Bank of Baroda, on the other hand, has cut interest rates on automobile loans by 100 basis points.

				 Pre-emptive steps rein in inflation
 OUR BUREAU				 	 In control																								Mumbai, Oct. 29: A day ahead of its monetary policy review, the Reserve Bank today said pre-emptive monetary and fiscal measures had helped in containing inflation, indicating that there might not be any hike in interest rates.																								In its macroeconomic review, the RBI said pre-emptive monetary measures since mid-2004 accompanied by fiscal and supply side measures have helped in containing inflation.																								RBIs review is in line with observations of bankers and economists on inflation.																								They say that with moderating inflation, the apex bank should take a call on lowering interest rates, which have peaked and are now impeding high growth momentum. 																								The RBI, however, felt that consumer price inflation remained firm during the second quarter of 2007-08 because of higher food prices. Only the wholesale price inflation is under control.																								Assessment of key macroeconomic indicators in select emerging market economies shows that consumer price inflation was in the range of 1.4-9.5 per cent in August-September. The RBI said India ranked in this list.																								Inflation in the country eased below 4 per cent from mid-August to 3.1 per cent by October 6, partly because of base effects and the negative contribution from fuel prices, it said.																								The RBI said its endeavour to contain inflation at close to 5 per cent in 2007-08 and to the range of 4-4.5 per cent over the medium term would be conducive for maintaining self-accelerating growth over the medium term.																								According to the RBI, a sustained performance by manufacturing and services fuelled the strong growth momentum.																								Agriculture witnessed a recovery with a percentage point increase over the corresponding quarter.																								The Central Statistical Organisation in August 2007 estimated the GDP growth during the first quarter at 9.3 per cent compared with 9.6 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year.

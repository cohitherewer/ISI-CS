				 Pullback pacifies jittery nerves
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 23: The sensex began its clawback today with an 879-point gain  its biggest single-day surge  as fears of a pullout by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) eased.																								On Monday, Sebi chairman M. Damodaran had said the regulator would allow registration of proprietary sub-accounts of FIIs and streamline the process. 																								The announcement cleared the air of uncertainty that hung over the market after the sudden clampdown on partcipatory notes (P-notes) last Tuesday. The FIIs turned net sellers in the markets with reported sales of around $1 billion in the last two sessions alone, which tipped the sensex over the abyss.																								Todays rally was led by capital goods, banking and heavyweights such as Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). Market observers said short-covering by operators ahead of the monthly expiry of the futures contract on Thursday also provided the ballast to stocks.																								Brokers said Damodarans video conference call with representatives of nine FIIs yesterday had removed the apprehensions in the minds of players. 																								Sebis plan to allow registration of proprietary sub-accounts belonging to FIIs and create new categories of registered investors removed some of the anxieties. This sparked the optimism that FII funds will continue to flow into the domestic stock markets, said an analyst with a brokerage.																								He added that though the markets would be awaiting the outcome of the Sebi board meeting on October 25, there would be other issues which would play an important role in the coming days. The market will be looking for global cues, quarterly results of companies, crude oil prices and political developments, the analyst said.																								The BSE sensex opened with an upside gap and consolidated its gains as the day progressed. After opening at 17910.30 over the previous close of 17613.99, it hit a high of 18542.41. It closed at 18492.84, a gain of 4.99 per cent, or 878.85 points.																								All the sectoral indices ended in the green. Capital goods, banking and realty were star performers. RIL gained 7.83 per cent, or Rs 1,880.80, to Rs 2,601.55 while L amp;T gained Rs 233.30 to Rs 3,331.00. 																								The rally in the stock markets came as a huge relief for the rupee, which staged a smart recovery against the dollar. The currency ended 28 paise stronger at Rs 39.59/60 against the greenback. Observers said this was the largest gain by the rupee since October 3. The currency moved in a range of Rs 39.58 and Rs 39.82 during the day.

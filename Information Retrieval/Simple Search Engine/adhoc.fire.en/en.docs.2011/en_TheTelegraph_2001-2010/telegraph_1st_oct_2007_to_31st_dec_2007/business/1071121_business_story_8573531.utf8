				 Big queue for top NTPC post
 R. SURYAMURTHY																								New Delhi, Nov. 20: The government has started the search for the next chairman of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). The term of the present incumbent, T. Sankaralingam, will expire in April.																								Sources said the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) had prepared a shortlist of 13. Those in the fray include K. Ramachandran Pillai, A.K. Chaudhari and H.K. Sharma. 																								While Pillai is chairman of the National Textile Corporation, Chaudhari heads National Buildings Construction and Sharma is the boss of Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam.																								The selection board will recommend two names to the Cabinet Committee of Appointments.																								The board has fixed December 6 as the date for interviewing the candidates.																								Sankaralingam turns 60 in April and will relinquish charge after being at the helm of the countrys largest power generating company for only two years.																								Appointment rules for top jobs in public sector units make resignations mandatory after a person turns 60 or if the person is in the post for 5 years, whichever is earlier.																								Sources said the board could opt for a power veteran who, unlike Sankaralingam, would be in the job for five years to enable NTPC to meet its objectives for the Eleventh Plan (2007-12).																								According to officials, the search for senior positions in public sector units generally starts six months prior to the end of the tenure of an incumbent. During the search, the responsibilities of the incumbent are reduced to prevent irregularities.																								The challenges before the next chief of the NTPC are immense as the government has set a capacity addition target of 78,577 mega watt (MW) during the Eleventh Plan which will require investments worth Rs 1,00,000 crore.																								In the Tenth Plan (2002-07), the government had set a target of 41,000MW, but managed to add just 21,000MW to capacity. In the next five years, the plan is to set up 95 thermal projects, having 155 generation units and adding 58,644MW to the capacity.																								The target for hydel power is 53 projects and 180 generation units that will add 16,553MW to the capacity. 																								In nuclear, the plan is for four projects and seven units to produce 3,380MW.																								Weak start																								The government has informed the Rajya Sabha that the power capacity addition target for 2007-08, the first year of the Eleventh Plan, will not be met. The shortfall will be 26 per cent.																								In a written reply to the Upper House, power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said, During 2007-08, the proposed capacity addition target is 16,335MW. However, on present assessment, the expected capacity addition is likely to be 12,039MW.																								He said the commissioned capacity till November 12 was 2,645MW.

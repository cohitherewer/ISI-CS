				 Debt energiser for Anil firm
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 3: Reliance Power, the primary vehicle of Anil D. Ambani in power generation, will raise nearly Rs 76,473 crore via debt to fund its 12 projects under development, which involve an estimated cost of Rs 95,591 crore.																								The company, 50 per cent each owned by Reliance Energy (REL) and AAA Projects, a group holding firm, filed its draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India today. Reliance Power plans to sell 10.1 per cent to the public through the IPO.																								In its filing with Sebi, Reliance Power explained that proceeds from the proposed IPO will be used to partly fund five subsidiaries that are developing six projects. 																								Although Reliance Power said it planned to utilise Rs 6148.3 crore from the IPO proceeds to part-finance these identified projects, merchant bankers said the total size of the issue could be larger than this amount.																								These six projects are the 600MW Rosa Phase I, 600MW Rosa Phase II, 300MW Butibori, 3,960MW Sasan, 1,200MW Shahapur and 400MW Urthing Sobla project.																								The proceeds from the IPO will not flow into the much-awaited Dadri project.																								Reliance Power has mandated Macquarie India Advisory Services Pvt Ltd, ABN AMRO Bank NV and Deutsche Bank AG to arrange for syndicated loans of $6 billion or Rs 25,431 crore to part-finance the six identified projects.																								While $2 billion each will be arranged by these three entities, it will be the largest fund-raising exercise through this route done by any company this year. The estimated cost of the six projects is put at Rs 31,789 crore and this is part of the companys plan to fund projects using a mix of 80 per cent in debt and the rest through equity.																								Group chairman Anil D. Ambani holds 5,000 shares in Reliance Power jointly with AAA Projects and after the issue, the shareholding of REL and AAA Projects will come down to 45 per cent each.																								In its prospectus, Reliance Power said demand for power was expected to grow at an average annual rate of 9 per cent during the Eleventh Plan period (2007-12) and at an average annual rate of 7 per cent during the Twelfth Plan period. 																								In addition to the 24,200MW of power projects that it is currently developing, it could develop additional power projects to help meet this demand. This may include nuclear power projects if and when permitted by Indian law.

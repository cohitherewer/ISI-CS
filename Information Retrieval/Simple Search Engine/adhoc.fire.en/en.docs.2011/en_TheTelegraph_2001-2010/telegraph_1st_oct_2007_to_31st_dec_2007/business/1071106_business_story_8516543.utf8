				 L amp;T inks pact with Mitsubishi
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 5: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) today signed a joint venture deal with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd to manufacture super-critical steam turbines and generators for thermal power plants in India.																								The two companies will invest around Rs 880 crore in the venture that will cater to power plants with capacities ranging between 500MW and 1,000MW. 																								L amp;T has a joint venture with Mitsubishi to manufacture super-critical boilers. 																								This deal is expected to meet the demand-supply gap for power plant equipment as envisaged in the countrys plan for a major expansion in power generation capacity using super-critical technology, L amp;T sources said. 																								They said that while L amp;T had been looking for a global partner with advanced technology, Mitsubishi was seeking a foothold in power generation and equipment. 																								A super-critical turbine is an integral component of energy-efficient, thermal power plants. 																								Production is expected to start in the second half of 2008-09. 																								Mitsubishi has delivered around 70 units of super-critical turbines in Japan and abroad.

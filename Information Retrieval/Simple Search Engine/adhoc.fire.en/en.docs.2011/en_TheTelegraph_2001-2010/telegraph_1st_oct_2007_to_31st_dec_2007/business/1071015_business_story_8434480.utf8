				 Kotak Life gears up to expand reach
 ANIRUDH LASKAR 				 	 FUNDS FROLIC																								Mumbai, Oct. 14: Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Ltd will invest Rs 650 crore in expansion over the next three years.																								The company, which has invested about Rs 75 crore this year, said it would invest another Rs 75 crore by the year-end and Rs 250 crore each in the next two years, to enhance its distribution channels across the country. 																								Pankaj Desai, an executive director of the company, said, Considering the tremendous growth of the insurance industry today, we feel that we need to invest Rs 250 crore every year to reinforce our position in the market. We might have to invest even more if the market demands so.																								He said the funds would be used to expand to new cities, introduce more products and strengthen the bancassurance model, to ensure greater penetration.																								Kotak Life has 88 offices in 57 countries, and the plan is for 160 offices in 120 cities by year-end. The insurer, which has collected new business premia of about Rs 550 crore in 2006-07, has estimated a 100 per cent growth at about Rs 1,000 crore in this fiscal. 																								It said about 90 per cent of the premia was generated from selling unit-linked insurance products. 																								Desai said the company invested about 80 per cent of its capital in equities, unlike its rivals who invested around 35 per cent. This practice helped us generate compounded returns at about 30 per cent consistently over the last three years, Desai said.																								Investors tend to go for Kotaks balanced plans, where they are allowed a 50-55 per cent exposure in equities, he said. 																								Desai sought greater freedom in investments from the government. The insurers should be allowed to invest in other market instruments to maximise their returns. We are happy that the regulator has considered derivatives as one of the best investment tools, but we think that a little more leeway is required. 																								Kotak Life, which has assets of about Rs 2,100 crore, provides life cover to about 10 lakh policyholders in India. 																								The company expects a rise in its assets to about Rs 8,000 crore by 2010, a growth of 90 per cent. The number of policyholders is expected to go up 90 per cent during this period.

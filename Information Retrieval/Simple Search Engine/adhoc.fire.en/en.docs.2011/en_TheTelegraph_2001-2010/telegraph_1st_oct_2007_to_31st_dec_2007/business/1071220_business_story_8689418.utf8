																								Calcutta, Dec. 19: India will negotiate an economic pact with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which comprises Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. 
																								Addressing a seminar organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce here today, Dominique Dreyer, Swiss ambassador to India, said, The joint study group set up to look into more liberalised co-operation between EFTA member countries and India has submitted its report in November. Based on that report, negotiations on further liberalisation of trade barriers in areas such as exports of goods and services, investments and intellectual property rights will start from January next year.
																								Dreyer said Switzerland would benefit the most from the pact as the volume of its bilateral trade was the highest among the EFTA countries. In 2006, India and Switzerland had bilateral trade worth 2.5 billion Swiss francs.

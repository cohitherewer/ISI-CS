				 Guessing game on FII stance 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Investors watch the sensex rally in Mumbai on Monday. (AFP)																								Mumbai, Oct. 29: After the sensex hit the 20000-mark, all eyes are now on foreign institutional investors (FIIs).																								It is widely believed that they will continue to show an active interest in India, though a section of them could book profit in the short run.																								Any exit will be the consequence of the moves by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to curb participatory notes, analysts said.																								According to Amar Ambani, vice-president, research, Indiainfoline, there is a fair chance of unregulated hedge funds opting out over the next few months. They could bring down their exposure, which could lead to some correction in the markets. But over the long term, liquidity flows from FIIs to India will continue, he said.																								Some analysts said valuations were looking stretched given the ferocity of the bull run. However, Ambani feels that though valuations are not cheap, they are not expensive when one takes other emerging markets into consideration. China is trading 40 times their fiscal 2009 earnings, while we are only trading at 19 times, he said.																								In coming days, the spotlight will be on Reserve Bank governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy and his US counterpart Ben Bernanke.																								The market has discounted a 25 basis-point cut in rates by Bernankes Federal Reserve, and there is a small section who believe Reddy will bring down short-term rates in his monetary policy tomorrow. If this happens, there could be yet another major rally, an analyst said.																								FIIs have sold small quantities in the past two trading sessions, but analysts say it is not an indicator of the shape of things to come. 																								Dhiraj Sachdev, vice-president and fund manager at HSBC Asset Management, feels FIIs may not go long on US markets because of the subprime issue. It is likely that they will focus on Asia.																								PM happy																								Terming the signals from stock markets as positive, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the India story looks so good and promised to carry forward reforms to make the economy more efficient.																								Be it FDI flows, investments in our stock markets or investments in knowledge economy, the signals are all positive. We will work to keep these positive, he said at a meet of global investors and bankers here today.																								His comment coincided with the crossing of 20000 by the sensex. Singh said he was satisfied with current growth rates of the economy. The high growth rates have influenced the flow of foreign funds into Indian markets.																								For this, Singh gave credit to finance minister P. Chidambaram and deputy chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia.																								I know very well that investment is an act of faith. It is shaped by perceptions, by expectations and by all uncertainties of life. I invite you to have faith in India, he said.

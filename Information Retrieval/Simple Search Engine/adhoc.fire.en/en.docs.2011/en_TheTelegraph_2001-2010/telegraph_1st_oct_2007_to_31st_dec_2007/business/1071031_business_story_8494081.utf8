				 Banks to spare home loan borrowers
 OUR BUREAU				 	 SOME RELIEF																								Oct. 30: The CRR hike has dashed any hopes of a cut in home loan rates, but bankers said they were unlikely to pass on the burden of the hike to borrowers.																								Senior honchos of the State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank said they were unlikely to raise rates. 																								SBIs chairman and managing director .P. Bhatt said his bank had no plans to change rates, while ICICI Banks joint managing director Chanda Kochar said it was possible for the bank to absorb the hike.																								HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said lending rates could soften. He said HDFC would arrive at a decision only after observing trends in the home loan market in the next few days.																								A senior executive of a nationalised bank said the CRR hike would impact margins of banks, who would now have to look at their deposit rates. 																								They are at high levels and need to be brought down. There could be some action on this front, he said. 																								Since the RBI began its monetary tightening measures, interest rates on home loans have risen by more than 300 basis points and sometimes by even 400 basis points.																								Borrowers, however, can expect some procedural relief. Reddy called for a review of the practice of raising interest rates during the repayment period. 																								Such revisions, though permitted by the contract with the borrower, happen even in fixed-rate loans.																								It is not appropriate for a bank, which is a trusted institution to use technical provisions with the customer to enhance monthly instalments unreasonably, Reddy told journalists.																								The RBI may even have to create certain rights for the borrower, if banks continue with such contracts.																								According to Reddy, banks are not only obliged to explain the revision, but also ensure a rollback if there is a cut in rates.																								The regulator will also come out with a circular to do away with charges on account closures.																								Closing of account does not require a big effort ... You can just close it, whats the problem? Reddy said.																								He said the proposed circular would ensure that there were no charges even if the existing contract provided for one.

				 DoT signals spectrum truce
 JAYATI GHOSE				 	 FRESH EFFORTS																								New Delhi, Nov. 20: The department of telecommunications (DoT) is willing to reduce subscriber requirements for extra spectrum provided GSM operators withdraw their cases before the telecom tribunal.																								At the meeting with five top private telecom operators tomorrow, DoT secretary D.S. Mathur is likely to propose a rise in subscriber numbers by 2-3 times which is much less than the stipulation of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).																								For instance, to get 10MHz of spectrum in the Calcutta circle, Trai had stipulated 20 lakh subscribers for an operator. 																								The DoT is likely to reduce this to 12 lakh users.																								GSM operators  Bharti, Vodafone and Idea  said they would look into the DoT proposals in detail before taking a decision on withdrawing their petitions at the tribunal.																								The operators also have their own demands that include lowering of spectrum charges and the DoT not taking back the spectrum allocated to an operator.																								The DoT is also open to meeting the spectrum demands of existing players prior to allocating the scarce resource to new players.																								Officials said the DoT was in a position to distribute 60-65 MHz of spectrum.																								Communications minister A. Raja in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had stated that there is enough scope for allotment of spectrum to a few new operators even after meeting the requirements of existing operators and licensees.																								Stiff opposition from GSM operators has forced the DoT to set up a committee to review the recommendations of its technical panel, the Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC).																								The TEC had endorsed Trais proposals on subscriber requirements and even made the norms more stringent.																								By setting up the committee, which has representatives of GSM firms, the DoT has opened up the possibility of relaxation in the TECs norms.

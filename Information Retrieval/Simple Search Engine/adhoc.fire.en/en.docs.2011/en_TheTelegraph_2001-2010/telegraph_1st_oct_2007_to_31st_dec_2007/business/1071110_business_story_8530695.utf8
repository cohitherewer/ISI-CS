				 Tea prices set to gain strength
 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA				 	 Not so green																								Calcutta, Nov. 9: Lower domestic CTC production and a shortage of the orthodox variety in the global market are likely to give producers higher return in the local market and abroad.																								Indications from tea growing areas show that production of orthodox tea in north India, which is primarily absorbed by the export market, is higher by 7 million kg till the end of August, said Amit Chaudhuri, chairman and managing director of J Thomas amp; Co Ltd, the oldest auction house in Asia. But there is a net shortfall of CTC tea for the domestic market, he added.																								Tea Boards figures for August reveal that the production of north Indian crops, comprising CTCs and orthodox, are down by 5.6 million kg to 100.6 million kg from 106.2 million kg last year. The figures also show a deficit of 5 million kg from the Assam valley. 																								The CTC shortfall in Assam is expected to be around 12 million kg.																								But with production in the Dooars, the Terai and Cachar up 3.5 million kg, the overall north Indian CTC deficit at the end of August is around 9 million kg. Crop intake reports from Assam in September and early October have been disappointing and a further decline is expected, Chaudhury added.																								Indians consume around 823 million kg of tea annually, with consumption growth pegged at 3 to 4 per cent.																								The global shortage in orthodox tea is because of lower production in Sri Lanka, which fell by 17 million kg. 																								In 2006, labour troubles sparked off a decline in the Sri Lankan production.																								However, east African nations, including Kenya, seem to have recovered from the devastating drought of 2005 and 2006. A record crop of 350 million kg is expected from this region.																								Kenya produced a bumper crop till June up 48 per cent from last year. Indian tea exports, like many other sectors, have been under the shadow of rupee appreciation.																								Producers forum																								Efforts to form a tea producers forum at the international level will soon become a reality. The modalities of setting up an international tea producers forum are expected to be finalised during the India International Tea Convention-2007, beginning at Guwahati from November 22.																								The bylaws of the forum will also be given a final shape at the three-day convention, according to the United Planters Association of South India.

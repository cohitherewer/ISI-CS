 LOOSE CHANGE
																								 UTI Mutual Fund has expanded the investment mandate for its UTI GSF Petro Fund and renamed it UTI Energy Fund from October 5. The fund will now have a broader investment horizon that will include companies associated with the energy sector as a whole and not only crude and petroleum products manufacturing and marketing companies as was in the case of UTI Petro Fund. The UTI GSF Petro last week announced an 80 per cent tax-free dividend (for the dividend option) and a bonus of three units for every two held as on October 3. 																								 DSPML Mutual Fund has revised the load structure under Technology.Com, Opportunities, Top 100 Equity, India T.I.G.E.R and Small and Midcap funds. The fund has also changed the load structure for DSPML Equity fund with effect from October 8. The fund will charge an exit load of 1 per cent if the units are redeemed within 6 months from the date of allotment and an exit load of 0.50 per cent if the units are redeemed after 6 months but before 12 months . 																								 HSBC Mutual Fund has announced October 5 as the record date for dividends under HSBC India Opportunities Fund and HSBC Midcap Equity Fund.

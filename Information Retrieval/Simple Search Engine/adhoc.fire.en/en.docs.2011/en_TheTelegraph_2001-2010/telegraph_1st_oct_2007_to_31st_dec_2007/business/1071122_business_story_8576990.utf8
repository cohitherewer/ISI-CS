				 Power tariff bait to meet peak demand
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 21: The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission today proposed that electricity generated by a power station during trial operations be paid differential tariff depending on demand. Such a move will encourage utilities to inject more power into the grid during peak hours.																								The commission also mooted the idea of providing operational flexibility to hydroelectric stations by allowing them to deviate from a given schedule.																								Inviting comments and suggestions on the draft regulations, the power regulator said infirm power generated for testing should be paid at frequency-linked real time unscheduled interchange (UI) rates. The UI charges are levied on firms and states for the supply and consumption of energy other than stipulated in a previously drawn daily schedule.																								This would induce the generating companies to maximise injection of infirm power during peak load hours and minimise it during off-peak hours, the commission said.																								It is expected that the new dispensation will result in higher revenue realisation and the excess recovery will be accounted for a reduction in the capital cost of the project.																								This will be beneficial for the generating company as it will recover some of its investment upfront. The beneficiaries will have to pay a lower tariff after commissioning on account of the reduction in the capital cost for the purpose of tariff, it added.																								At present, a thermal generating station is given a constant rate for infirm power corresponding to fuel cost per unit, while a hydro station is paid at a primary energy rate.																								In another proposal, the CERC said hydro generating stations should be free to deviate from the given schedule, as long as they do not cause transmission constraints.																								The net actual energy supplied by a hydel plant over a day may differ from the original schedule for that day. A compensation for this variation shall be made by the regional load dispatch centre.

				 Ruia stake in Malaysia firm
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Ruia: Widening reach																								Calcutta, Oct. 1: Ruia Group has picked up a 30 per cent stake in Industronics Berhad, a technology company listed on the Malaysian stock exchange.																								The Pawan Ruia-promoted entity bought into the Malaysian firm through a special purpose vehicle, Bloom Billions Sdn Bhd.																								Ruia Group is a major player in the tyre industry, being the promoter of Falcon, Dunlop and Monotona. It also has interests in engineering (Jessop) and in sugar (Kamlapur). 																								Pawan Ruia, his brother Deepak and group executive Sanjay K. Garodia have joined the Industronics board.																								Incorporated in 1975, Industronics is a solution provider for digital public information systems, working under the Olympex brand. 																								It also has security systems, industrial automation and other electronics and telecommunication products in its portfolio. 																								Industronics, which has subsidiaries in China, Singapore and Vietnam, reported the rupee-equivalent income of Rs 110 crore and a profit of Rs 1.38 crore during 2006-07. 																								Ruia said Industronics would have a great future in India. The modernisation programme of the Indian Railways is expected to spill over to areas such as public information display systems. Proposed airports in different states will require software-based public information systems, he said.																								An Indian arm of Industronics will be set up soon.																								It is a good fit for the kind of work Jessop is doing. There can be a lot of synergy between the two, he added.

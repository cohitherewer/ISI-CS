				 Clampdown on deposit rate bias
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 26: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today asked banks not to discriminate on interest rates paid on deposits with the same maturity.																								It also directed banks to wind up special deposit schemes that come with riders such as a lock-in period.																								The central bank explained that such special deposit schemes violated its master circular issued in July. 																								The circular said no bank should discriminate in the matter of interest paid on deposits, between one deposit and another, accepted on the same date and for the same maturity, except in respect of fixed deposit schemes specifically for resident Indian senior citizens that offer higher and fixed rates of interest compared with normal deposits of any size.																								Banks began offering special deposit schemes last year to mobilise resources when their advances were growing at a fast pace. Such schemes were offered by both nationalised and private sector banks.																								For instance, State Bank of Travancores special fixed deposit scheme SBT 2007 Special had a lock-in period of one year. The fixed deposit scheme offered an interest rate of 9 per cent and the minimum deposit for this scheme was Rs 5,000.																								The bank reported a total business of Rs 59,000 crore at the end of the second quarter in this financial year. Total deposits of the bank grew by more than 21 per cent.																								Punjab National Bank offered a one-year Mahabachat special deposit scheme offering 9.5 per cent interest. It discontinued the scheme from June 30. The minimum deposit for the scheme was Rs 25,000. The bank mopped up over Rs 12,000 crore during April-June period through this special deposit scheme. 																								The RBI today said that some banks were offering special term deposit products to customers with certain features and restrictions.																								They included lock-in periods ranging from 6 to 12 months. Moreover, during the lock-in period, premature withdrawal is not permitted. In case of premature withdrawal during the lock-in period, no interest is paid. The central bank also said that rates of interest offered on these deposits were not in tune with the rates of interest on normal deposits.																								The RBI warned that banks violating its directive could attract penalty under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.																								The RBI directive on not discriminating between interest rates, effectively means that though banks can continue to offer higher interest rates to senior citizens, they cannot henceforth offer higher rates on special deposit schemes of the same maturity. However, banks can offer varying rates on single term deposits of Rs 15 lakh and above.																								It is clarified that the special schemes, with lock-in periods and other features which have been floated by some banks, are not in conformity with our instructions. Banks that have floated such deposit schemes are, therefore, advised to discontinue the schemes with immediate effect and report compliance, the RBI said.																								Senior bankers were not immediately available for comments. An official from ICICI Bank said the private sector bank did not stipulate a lock-in period in any of its deposits. The bank had recently brought down interest rates on special deposits by 50 basis points.																								The State Bank of India also has a special deposit scheme called the SBI Super Term Deposit Scheme. However, interest rates on this scheme do not differ from interest rates on its domestic term deposits.

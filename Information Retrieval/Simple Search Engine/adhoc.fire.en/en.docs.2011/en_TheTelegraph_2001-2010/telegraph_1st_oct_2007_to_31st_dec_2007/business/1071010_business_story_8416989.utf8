				 Status quo on 2G spectrum
 JAYATI GHOSE				 	 Old rules rule																								New Delhi, Oct. 9: The government will not auction second-generation (2G) spectrum. 																								It is likely to go ahead with the current first come, first served policy of spectrum allocation to new as well as existing telecom players. 																								Existing operators are likely to get spectrum on a priority basis, as and when radiowaves become available, while new players will be granted spectrum on a first come, first served basis, said officials.																								There are no provisions for an auction in existing norms. The spectrum comes with the licence.																								When it acquires a pan-India licence, a GSM player gets 4.4MHz of spectrum and a CDMA operator, 2.5MHz. 																								Operators also get spectrum on the basis of a subscriber-linked formula.																								Communications minister A. Raja had said on Monday there would be no change in licence norms for new players.																								If the department of telecom (DoT) goes ahead with the current norms, the applications of existing operators such as Vodafone, Reliance, Idea and Spice will get a priority over the new players. 																								Though they have a licence, the existing operators have been waiting for months to get spectrum.																								However, the policy will spell a disaster for global players such as AT amp;T and realty firms Unitech and DLF who are way behind in the queue for licences.																								The DoT will finalise the new guidelines for issuing licences and allocating spectrum to future telecom players by October 15. So far, over 30 companies have placed around 500 applications with the DoT, in the hope of bagging spectrum at a throwaway price of Rs 1,680 crore.																								The DoT may also consider changing eligibility norms for GSM players, who can apply for more than 10MHz of spectrum if they have a certain number of subscribers. 																								The department may raise this subscriber limit.																								In August, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had recommended a revision of the subscriber-linked spectrum allocation policy. It doubled the required number of subscribers from one million in metros to two million, and in rural circles from 900,000 to four million. 																								The regulator had also suggested that beyond 10MHz, operators should be made to pay for the spectrum. 																								The move was criticised by the Cellular Operators Association of India.

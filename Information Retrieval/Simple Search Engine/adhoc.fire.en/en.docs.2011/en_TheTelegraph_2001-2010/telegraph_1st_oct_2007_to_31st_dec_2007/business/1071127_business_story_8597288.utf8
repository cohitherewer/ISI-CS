				 Banks match global standards
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 RBI deputy governor V. Leeladhar in Mumbai on Monday. (Fotocorp)																								Mumbai, Nov. 26: Reserve Bank deputy governor V. Leeladhar today asserted that Indias banks were more liberal than carping critics in the US make it out to be  and dredged up some facts to buttress his point.																								During the period between 2003 and October 2007, India granted 19 authorisations to US-based banks, most of which have been utilised. On the other hand, the US did not authorise any office of the Indian banks despite requests to establish three branches, two subsidiaries and nine representative offices, Leeladhar said.																								He was debunking some of the myths that US critics have been trying to propagate while putting pressure on India to open up its financial sector.																								The Reserve Banks regulatory approach towards foreign banks is much more liberal and non-discriminatory when compared with most of the banking standards in the world, the RBI deputy governor said at a bankers conference which opened here today.																								Leeladhar said India was obliged to issue only 12 licences to foreign banks every year, according to its commitments to the WTO. However, the central bank had authorised as many as 75 branches between 2003 and October 2007, excluding the off-site ATMs set up by them.																								Indian banks still face huge delays in receiving US authorisations for opening branches there, he added.																								India issues a single class of banking licence to foreign banks. It does not require them to graduate from a lower to a higher category of banking licence over a number of years  a practice that is followed in certain other jurisdictions. This approach places the foreign banks on a par with other Indian banks and permits the banks to carry on retail and wholesale operations from the start.																								The RBI does not bar foreign banks from setting up non-banking financial subsidiaries, which is in sharp contrast to the practices followed in most other countries.																								Under the WTO commitments, India can deny licences to new foreign banks when the share of foreign banks assets exceeds 15 per cent of the total assets of the Indian banking system. 																								As of June this year, the market share of foreign banks in India in terms of deposits and advances stood at 6.11 and 6.83 per cent, respectively. 																								Besides the share of foreign banks in the foreign exchange market had risen from 41 per cent in 2005-06 to about 52 per cent during the first half of 2007-08.

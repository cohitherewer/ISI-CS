				 Price rise alarms Opec officials
																								Singapore, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Top Opec officials expressed alarm on Wednesday at oil prices threatening to top $100, but reiterated that markets were well supplied and steered clear of saying whether the group would raise output next week.																								The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) is under mounting pressure from consumer nations to raise production again to stop oil prices from vaulting above $100 a barrel, which would add strain to a vulnerable world economy.																								But with a week to go before the groups December 5 meeting in Abu Dhabi, Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, the groups most influential minister, and Opec president Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli stuck with familiar refrains about the healthy state of oil markets, saying prices were beyond its control.																								We observe with great concern the recent escalation of oil prices. But we believe that the world market is well supplied and petroleum inventories are comfortable, Naimi said in a speech at an energy conference in Singapore.																								Asked about next weeks meeting, Naimi said: We need to look at the data, at the information, and then we will decide. 																								Both Naimi and Hamli said they were not aware of any specific output proposals, dismissing news reports that Gulf ministers were considering an increase of up to 750,000 barrels per day (bpd).																								We have not discussed the agenda, you will know (it) next week, Hamli said.																								The group, which controls more than a third of the worlds oil, added 500,000 bpd to markets from November 1 but traders fear that is too little to keep oil stocks from falling sharply when consumption rises during the northern winter. 																								Naimi echoed other ministers in blaming the weakening US dollar, speculation and geopolitical jitters for the more than 40 per cent rise in oil prices since mid-August, saying that $100 crude was unwarranted on the basis of supply and demand.																								There is no relationship between fundamentals and the price today, there is a mismatch. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong, he said. We have no control over prices, they are determined by the market.																								Oil prices fell on Tuesday on rising expectations of another supply increase in December, dropping below $95 for the first time in five days.

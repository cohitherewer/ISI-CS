				 Essar pockets Bharti BPO unit
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 14: Aegis, the BPO arm of the Essar group, has acquired Tele Tech Services (India), a joint venture of Tele Tech Europe and Bharti Ventures Ltd, for $13 million.																								A share purchase agreement has been signed and the deal is expected to be closed in 30 days.																								Gurgaon-based Tele Tech Services, which has a turnover of $15 million, has 2,200 employees who will be absorbed by Aegis.																								The $188-million Aegis has acquired seven BPO firms in India and the US over the past two-and-a-half-years. The company has 23 global centres worldwide, with 11 centres in nine Indian cities. It recorded a compounded growth of 44 per cent in the last three years. 																								Following the example of General Electronics and British Airways, Bharti Ventures is one of the several companies that have started exiting the BPO business to focus on their core activities. In this case, it will be leaving the company in the hands of its arch-rival Essar. 																								In the last few months, Citis BPO Citigroup Global Services has been put on the block, followed by Dell, which wants to get rid of its captive BPO business outside the US. 																								Aegis CEO and managing director Aparup Sengupta said, Most companies are now focusing on core competency and want to convert their fixed costs into variable costs. Tele Tech Services was into customer care. Customer lifecycle management is a core area for us. 																								The BPO arm of the Essar group caters to Fortune 500 clients across various verticals such as telecom, banking and finance, energy, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, education and logistics.																								By March 2008, the company expects a revenue of around $200 million, of which its US operations will account for $120 million. The rest will come from India.

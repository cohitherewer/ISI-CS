Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, Oct. 12: The UK-based Bentley Motors today launched two convertibles  the Azure and the Continental GTC  in the country.																								The Bentley Azure, priced at Rs 3.8 crore (ex-showroom Delhi), is powered by a V-8 6.75-litre twin turbo-charged engine. The Continental GTC, which costs around Rs 2.10 crore (ex-showroom Delhi), has a 6.0-litre twin-turbo charged engine. 																								Both the cars are manufactured at the companys UK plant and will be imported as completely built units. The cars will be sold through the companys India partner, Delhi-based Exclusive Motors Private Limited.																								The launch of these two convertibles will be a step towards Bentleys commitment to India and to fulfil the ever growing desire of Indians for premium cars by bringing to the country the latest from Bentleys stable globally, said Satya Bagla, managing director of Exclusive Motors. 																								The car maker also wants a revision in the import duty structure for automobiles. 																								The premium car market in India has been growing fast. But you have to look at the tax structure for imported cars, said Ian Gorsuch, regional director of Bentley (West Asia, Africa and India). 																								India levies over 100 per cent duty on imported vehicles. Gorsuch, however, said despite the current tax structure on imported cars, the company had been able to grow significantly in the country. 																								Bentley plans to sell at least 25 cars every year in India. Since its entry in 2003, Bentley has sold more than 40 cars in the super-luxury segment.

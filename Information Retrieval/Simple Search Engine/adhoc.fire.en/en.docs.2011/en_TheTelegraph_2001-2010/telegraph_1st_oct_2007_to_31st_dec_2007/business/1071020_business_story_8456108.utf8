				 IT zones in Bengal cleared
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Pillai: Go-ahead																								New Delhi, Oct. 19: The board of approval (BoA) for special economic zones (SEZ) today gave formal approvals to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Bengal Shristi for IT zones in Bengal. 																								The BoA, chaired by commerce secretary G.K. Pillai, today granted 10 formal and three in-principle approvals for SEZs. 																								The IT project of Bengal Shristi will be near Asansol in over 10 hectares, while TCS plans to build its IT zone in over 16 hectares at New Town, Rajarhat.																								The board, which considered 15 proposals, also approved Perfect IT SEZs plan for a 10-hectare IT and ITeS zone in Noida. 																								Adani Groups 1,000-hectare multi-product zone at Mundra in Gujarat was also given a go-ahead.																								However, a decision on plans by DLF and Unitech Hitech for setting up tax-free zones in Noida and in the National Capital Region, respectively, was deferred as the promoters did not have land in possession, said Pillai.																								This is the first decision on SEZs after the Union cabinet had cleared the resettlement and rehabilitation policy for SEZs on October 11, making the process of land acquisition transparent and easy for promoters.																								The other proposals that were formally cleared include Saloni Business Parks 27- hectare biotechnology park in Maharashtra as well as a 15- hectare electronic hardware and IT zone in Raigad, proposed by Modern India Property Developers.																								Privilege Power and Infrastructures 2,245-hectare multi-product zone in Maharashtra got an in-principle clearance.																								With these approvals, the number of SEZs with formal clearance now stands at 396, said Pillai.

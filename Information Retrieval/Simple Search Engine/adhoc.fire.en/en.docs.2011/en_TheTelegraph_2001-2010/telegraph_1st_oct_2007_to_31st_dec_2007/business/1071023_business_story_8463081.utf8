				 Sector-specific export sops
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Commerce minister Kamal Nath with Finnish minister for foreign trade and development Paavo Vayrynen in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Prem Singh																								New Delhi, Oct. 22: The government plans to refund export taxes and levies on a sectoral basis. 																								Union commerce minister Kamal Nath said his ministry was preparing a cabinet note on additional tax saving measures for exporters. He is optimistic that the country will achieve the export target of $160 billion for the current fiscal despite the appreciation of the rupee. 																								He hoped the target would be met just as targets were met in the previous years. 																								However, senior officials in his ministry feel even $140 billion will be a tall order.																								We are looking at measures for refund and remission of taxes to ensure that exporters get a level playing field, Nath said before a review meeting to assess the export performance of the plantation sector.																								The rupee has strengthened by about 10 per cent since March this year, putting Indian exporters at a disadvantage against competitors, especially China.																								In July, the government had announced a Rs 1,400-crore package for exporters and exempted seven items from service tax. 																								The government will meet different export promotion councils in November and review the overall situation.																								There are differences between commerce and finance ministries on packages for exporters hit by the rising rupee.The revenue department has conveyed to the commerce ministry that it was not in favour of refunding state level taxes to the exporters.

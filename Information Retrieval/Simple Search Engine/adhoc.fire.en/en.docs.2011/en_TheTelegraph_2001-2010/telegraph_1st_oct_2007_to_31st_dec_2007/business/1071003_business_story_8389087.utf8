				 Carrefour in talks to pick local partner
 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE				 	 French connection																								New Delhi, Oct. 2: French retail giant Carrefour is preparing a list of domestic companies with whom it can tie up for India entry.																								Sources said over the last few weeks, the chain had held talks with many big Indian industrial houses, including Essar, Reliance ADAG, DLF and Future Group. 																								A spokesperson for the French company, however, said in an e-mail that Carrefour does not comment on that (entry into India with a local partner) subject.																								If Carrefour enters the retail segment by tying up with an Indian partner, it will follow the US-based giant Wal-Mart, which has worked out a similar arrangement with Bharti. FDI is not allowed in retail, but foreign chains can join hands with Indian groups as their back-end suppliers. 																								Alternatively, industry analysts feel Carrefour can enter the Indian market through the wholesale route. German retailer Metro has chosen this route and has set up a cash-and-carry wholesale outlet in Bangalore. Foreign direct investment up to 100 per cent is allowed through this route. 																								The size of the organised retail sector is estimated at Rs 55,000 crore. This market is expected to grow 39.6 per cent in value terms by 2011, averaging a growth of 7 per cent a year. 																								With retail trade showing such promise, both foreign chains and Indian corporate houses are eager to cash in on the potential.																								Domestic retail majors, however, do not think the entry of multinationals will pose a threat as there is enough space for all to coexist. Organised retail is just 3 per cent of the total market. 																								A Future Group spokesperson said, We dont feel threatened by the retail chains coming from abroad. We have built a bond with our customers and we try to improve based on customer feedback.																								Initially, all large format stores will have to penetrate into a market dominated by the local grocer. 																								Deepankar Sanwalka, executive director of KPMG, said, Foreign retailers may face the same problem that Indian retailers are facing. 																								The violence Reliance is facing is symbolic. This is happening because the smallest of the retailers, the neighbourhood vegetable and fruit sellers, are feeling threatened. They are scared that they may be out of business.

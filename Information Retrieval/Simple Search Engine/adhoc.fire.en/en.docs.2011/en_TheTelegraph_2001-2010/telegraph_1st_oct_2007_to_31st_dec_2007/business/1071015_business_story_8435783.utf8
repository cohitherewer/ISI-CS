				 Mahindras to recast auto parts operations
				 	 All for one																								Mumbai, Oct. 14 (PTI): Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M) today said it would bring its six auto component companies under an umbrella outfit  Systech  before going for an initial public offering.																								The six companies are Mahindra Engineering, Mahindra Sourcing, Mahindra Forging, Mahindra Gears, Mahindra Composites and Mahindra Ugine Steel Company.																								Under the restructuring plan, the six businesses will be brought under Systech, said Hemant Luthra, president (systems and technologies) of M amp;M. 																								Of these six entities, three are listed  Mahindra Composites, Mahindra Forging and Mahindra Ugine.																								M amp;M promoters hold a 45.06 per cent stake in Mahindra Composites, 47.11 per cent in Mahindra Forging and 55.53 per cent in Mahindra Ugine.																								In the unlisted companies, the promoters hold almost the entire stake.																								Systech will hit the capital markets at a later date, but certainly not this year, Luthra said.																								By the time the restructuring ends, M amp;M will complete its investment of Rs 800 crore in the component businesses.																								The company also wants to wait for court approval for the consolidation of Mahindra Forging before it comes out with the IPO. 																								M amp;M is also looking at acquisitions in the component sector. Seven acquisitions have been made in this sector. 																								More deals are thrown at us than we are capable of handling. But most of the deals are coming from Europe and North America, he said.																								Mahindra plans to concentrate on Europe because of its German acquisitions. 																								Our portfolio is better served by making sure that we have the right market, distribution and access in Europe. And that is more important to us right now, he said.																								Mahindra is also looking at China for acquisitions.																								We are looking at China, but very selectively to see where we can leverage, he added.

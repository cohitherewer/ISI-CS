				 Record deal for Mumbai plot
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 26: An auction of commercial plots in Mumbais Bandra Kurla Complex saw a record land deal today that was priced at Rs 46,800 per square feet.																								The record-breaking price was paid by the Mumbai-based Wadhwa group which bid Rs 831 crore for a plot measuring 15,500 square metres (3.83 acres). In other words, the plot saw a bid at Rs 5,04,000 a square metre, an all-time high. It was 230 per cent higher than the reserve price.																								The auction was conducted by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) which put three plots on the block. Reliance Industries Ltd, the countrys largest private sector company, bid Rs 918 crore for a 30,550-square-metre plot to build a commercial centre and a car park facility for at least 550 vehicles. The bid was over 95 per cent higher than the reserve price.																								TCG and the Hirnandani group together bid Rs 1,041 crore for a 28,300-square-metre plot.																								It is understood that though the MMRDA set a reserve price of around Rs 1,000 crore for the three plots. The bids fetched the authority over Rs 2.700 crore. The high bids reflect the surge in the value of space in the commercial capital. Experts say commercial property prices are unlikely to ease.

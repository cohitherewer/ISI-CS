				 Stock shine eludes mutuals
 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY																								Calcutta, Oct 28: The recent euphoria in the stock markets has failed to spill over to mutual funds. 																								Data on growth in assets under management (AUM) of funds between April and September this year is skewed towards income funds, which are primarily debt schemes. During this period, assets of equity funds grew the least among all categories of mutual funds.																								Assets of income funds increased 46.47 per cent, while that of diversified equity funds grew 28.41 per cent and equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS), 31.98 per cent. In balanced funds, which are hybrids of equity and debt funds, assets grew 39.47 per cent.																								High returns																								The asset growth figures are in sharp contrast to the returns from mutual fund schemes. 																								Between April and September this year, diversified equity schemes gave a return of 36.34 per cent; ELSS a return of 36.58 per cent and income schemes, 14-27 per cent. 																								Pure debt funds yielded a return of less than 10 per cent. 																								This shows that the surge in stock prices over the last three to four years had little effect on retail investors. One probable reason for the slow growth in assets of mutual fund schemes is the aversion of retail investors towards risky assets such as equities.																								However, the asset growth of income and debt funds, for the period under review, took place at a time of rising interest rates. In contrast, when the rates rose in 2004, assets of income and debt funds declined, while those of equity schemes went up. 																								But this time around, the launch of fixed maturity plans by mutual funds giving a better return than bank fixed deposits helped the assets of income funds to surge at a rapid pace, said a debt fund manager of a private sector mutual fund.																								Fund inflow																								Among income funds, assets of fixed maturity plans of 12 months or less witnessed the highest increase. This is because of the large flow of funds from institutional and big-ticket investors into income funds. Banks started increasing their interest rates from around September 2006. However, a net outflow from income funds, of Rs 3,714 crore, occurred only in September 2007. 																								Net inflows into equity funds from the beginning of this calendar year till September were lower at Rs 8,989 crore compared with Rs 9,462 crore during the same period last year.																								Open-ended schemes																								Open-ended equity index plans of mutual funds gave a better return than share indices such as the sensex and the BSE-100 over the one-month period ended October 12. 																								During this period, the sensex witnessed the steepest rise from below 15500 to over 18800.

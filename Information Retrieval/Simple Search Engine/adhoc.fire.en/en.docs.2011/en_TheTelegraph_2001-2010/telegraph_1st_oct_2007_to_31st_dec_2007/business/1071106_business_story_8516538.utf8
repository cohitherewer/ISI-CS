				 Duty rejig preferred to oil price hike
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Deora: Action time																								New Delhi, Nov. 5: The Centre would much prefer to cut oil duties rather than raise retail fuel prices to bail out state-run companies. 																								With assembly polls in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh round the corner, the government is not inclined to raise fuel prices.																								Petroleum minister Murli Deora today said, Political leadership feels that the government should not burden the middle class.																								Officials indicated that excise and customs levies could be tweaked to reduce the duty burden on oil marketing companies. The rejig could bring down the duty on petrol by Rs 2 a litre and and on diesel by Re 1 a litre. Deora said he hoped to take a final call during his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday. 																								Last week, Deora had held meetings with the Prime Minister, finance minister P. Chidambaram and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.																								Customs and excise duties contribute to 35-40 per cent of fuel prices. 																								Users also have to contend with service taxes of states.																								An excise duty cut of a rupee on petrol will give the oil companies Rs 552.5 crore of extra revenues during the rest of the financial year. 																								A similar cut in diesel will fetch Rs 2,113.4 crore.																								The Indian basket of crude has climbed up by 145 per cent since April 2004, and petrol prices have gone up by just 29 per cent and diesel by 40 per cent.																								Oil refinery																								The Union cabinet is set to consider an oil ministry proposal to increase the foreign direct investment in refineries promoted by state entities to 49 per cent from 26 per cent, through the automatic route.																								It is coming up in the cabinet next week, petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan said here today. Present norms allow 49 per cent investment on a case-to-case basis. 																								In private refineries, the government allows 100 per cent foreign investment.																								Recently the government gave permission to Lakshmi Mittal to pick up a 49 per cent stake in the Bhatinda refinery of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited.																								The proposed policy change is in line with the countrys plan to expand its refining capacity by 62 per cent to 4.82 million barrels per day by 2012.

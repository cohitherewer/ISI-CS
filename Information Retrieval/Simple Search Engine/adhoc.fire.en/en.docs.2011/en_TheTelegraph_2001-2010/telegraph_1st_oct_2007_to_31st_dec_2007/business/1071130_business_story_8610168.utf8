				 Fresh sops to help rupee-hit exporters 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Chidambaram: Some relief																								New Delhi, Nov. 29: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today cut import duties on some textile fibres and offered to pick up a greater share of the interest burden on loans to help exporters. 																								The minister told Parliament that the customs duty on polyester fibres and intermediaries would be trimmed to 5 per cent from 7.5 per cent and on man-made fibres to 5 per cent from 10 per cent. 																								The sharp appreciation of the rupee over the last several months has put pressure on exports, particularly those with low import intensity such as leather, textiles, handicrafts and marine products, said Chidambaram. 																								The minister announced an additional subsidy of 2 per cent in pre-shipment and post-shipment credit to leather, marine, textiles (including ready-made garments and carpets, but excluding man-made fibre) and handicrafts. 																								The latest interest rate subsidy is in addition to the 2 per cent offered earlier this year. 																								The total subsidy will be subject to the condition that the interest rate, after the subsidy, will not fall below 7 per cent, which is the rate applicable to the agriculture sector under priority lending. 																								The term of credit is 180 days for pre-shipment and 90 days for post-shipment, except for carpets, for which the term will be 270 days for pre-shipment and 90 days (like other sectors) for post-shipment. 																								On paraxylene (a raw material for purified terephthalic acid), the customs duty is being scrapped from 2 per cent to nil. However, there will be no change in customs duties for nylon chips, nylon yarn, rayon grade wood pulp and acrylonitrile. 																								Chidambaram said the government would exempt storage and warehousing services, specialised cleaning services (fumigation and disinfection) and business exhibition from service tax. 																								He said the surge in the value of the rupee against the dollar by 15.1 per cent since October 2006 reflected the strength of the Indian economy.

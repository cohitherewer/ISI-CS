				 Rollout plans for 3G go awry
 JAYATI GHOSE				 	 AT DISCORD																								New Delhi, Oct. 7: The delay in 2G spectrum allocation has put brakes on the launch of 3G services in the country.																								3G is third-generation mobile technology that allows for quicker downloads of music and video files. 																								The auction of 3G licences, as recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), would have fetched the government at least Rs 1,400 crore from an operator.																								Trai had submitted its recommendations on the allocation and pricing of 3G spectrum on September 27, 2006. However, there has hardly been any progress.																								Already the government has missed the July deadline for the 3G spectrum policy 																								The recent scramble for telecom licences has shifted the telecom departments focus to providing a solution for 2G spectrum, said an official of the Cellular Operators Association of India. 																								Besides, the group of ministers, set up for spectrum vacation from defence services, has said the spectrum for the growth of existing 2G services is more important than planned 3G services.																								The defence authorities and the department of telecom (DoT) are looking to vacate around 25MHz of 2G spectrum as well as around 15MHz of 3G spectrum.																								Officials said, While the DoT is planning to formulate a 2G policy by the end of October, the sharp differences between the GSM and CDMA players over the contentious issue of spectrum allocation and the methodology to be adopted will delay the process.																								The officials said even if the DoT reached a decision on 3G spectrum, it wont be possible to launch the service before one-and-a-half years. 																								The bidding process will take many months. This, when it is now clearly understood that the broadband revolution will have to be wireless-based, the officials said. 																								At the current pace, we do not see 3G happening before the end of 2008, they added.																								Moreover, there are differences within the DoT over the rollout of 3G. Even though the DoT has no intention of putting it on the backburner, a section of the government is pushing for a freeze on 3G rollout, the officials said. 																								However, some DoT officials feel a broadband wireless network capable of carrying voice and data at reasonable rates will help create an infrastructure for the national information revolution.

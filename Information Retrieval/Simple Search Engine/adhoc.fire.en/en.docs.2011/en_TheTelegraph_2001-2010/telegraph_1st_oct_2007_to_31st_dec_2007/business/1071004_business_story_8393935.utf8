				 Cell circle on grey alert

Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Oct. 3: The Indian Cellular Association (ICA), the apex body for handset manufacturers, has asked the government to lower import duty on mobile phone accessories to counter the grey market. 																								The association, which has 400 members, wants duty cuts in batteries, chargers, bluetooth and hands-free devices.																								We had met officials of the department of telecommunications last year and will send our recommendations. We want the current rate of 34 per cent to be brought down to 8 per cent. As in the case of mobile phones, price is a key factor to counter the grey market, said Pankaj Mohindroo, national president of ICA.																								The market for accessories is estimated at Rs 3,000 crore, recording a growth of 40 per cent over the last two years.																								Batteries account for around 50 per cent of the market with the rest comprising chargers, hands-free and bluetooth devices. 																								According to industry experts, only 5 per cent of the accessories business is done legally. 																								Many companies in India have tied up with international firms to import accessories. They have even invested in research and development units to develop accessories and club them with handsets. 																								When mobile handsets were launched, around 90 per cent of the market was counterfeit. The price was an important factor to reverse the ratio of original to grey market handsets. Nine crore handsets with original batteries are expected to be sold this calendar year. The replacement battery market will be at 4-4.5 crore, around 70 per cent of which will be dominated by counterfeit products, said Mohindroo.																								At a time when handset prices are as low as Rs 777, prices of original batteries between Rs 550 and Rs 1,000 are too high, Mohindroo said. 																								The ICA had set a target of 30 million handsets by 2009. However, it has far exceeded this target and is expected to reach 50 to 60 million handsets by the end of this year.																								Product standard																								The ICA is working out a strategy with the Telecommunication Engineering Centre to develop a standard format for handset components. The ministry of consumer affairs has also shown an interest in this move to standardise products.

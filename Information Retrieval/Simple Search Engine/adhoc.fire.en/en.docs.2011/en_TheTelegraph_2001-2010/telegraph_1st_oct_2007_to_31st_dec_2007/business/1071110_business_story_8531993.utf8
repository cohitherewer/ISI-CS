				 December date for CSE board 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Calcutta Stock Exchange administrator Sunil Mitra with CEO T.V. Rangaswamy in Calcutta on Friday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Nov. 9: The demutualised Calcutta Stock Exchange may get its first board of directors by December 20. 																								Though the article of association of the stock exchange says that the number of board members will be 15, we will have a smaller board to start with, said T.V. Rangaswamy, chief executive officer of the stock exchange. 																								Rangaswamy, who is also the chief general manager of the Bombay Stock Exchange, said: A general meeting of the shareholders will be convened to elect the board members. According to stipulations, a minimum of one-third of board members will be people from public interest departments and another 33 per cent will be member brokers. 																								In August, the BSE picked up a 5 per cent stake in the CSE. 																								The century-old CSE was on the verge of closure. But today it got a new lease of life as it got linked to the online trading platform of the BSE. About 14-15 brokers of the city bourse celebrated the beginning of Samvat 2064 by trading shares worth Rs 40 lakh on the BSE online trading platform (BOLT) during the first 45 minutes of Muhurat trading. 																								HDFC Bank, which is the principal banker for the exchange, could open only 30 accounts till date. Had the bank been quicker, more than 100 brokers would have been trading today, said Sunil Mitra, CSEs administrator who is also the principal secretary in the state governments power ministry. 																								At present, there are more than 2,500 companies listed exclusively on the CSE. Following the arrangement with the BSE, about 200 of these companies, which comply with all listing norms and regulations, will be traded on the BSE in the first phase through a separate window from the second half of December, Mitra said. 																								CSE brokers, however, will have to pay a transaction fee of Rs 700 per Rs 1 crore turnover if they trade on BOLT  the BSE will take Rs 350 and the CSE will take Rs 350. Similarly, BSE brokers will have to pay the same fees if they trade in CSE-listed companies. 																								The arrangement between the two exchanges, which is the first of its kind in the country, is the beginning of an era of consolidation among bourses, said Mitra. 																								A higher transaction volume and value in dormant scrips in the CSE are expected to bring more income to the stock exchange.

				 Focus on health plan for elders
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 B.D. Banerjee in Calcutta on Saturday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, Oct. 6: A report on health insurance for senior citizens will be submitted by the first week of November. 																								A seven-member committee set up by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority is preparing the report.																								The committee will meet in Mumbai between October 9 and 11. The panel was asked to submit its report by October-end. But, I think, we will be able to give our recommendations only by November 7, said B.D. Banerjee, a member of the committee and former chairman of Oriental Insurance Company.																								The insurance regulator formed the committee in May this year under the chairmanship of K.S. Sastry, former chairman of the National Housing Bank. 																								Insurers increased premium on mediclaim plans by over 200 per cent between September 2006 and April this year. 																								According to Banerjee, the insurers raised the premium for senior citizens even though the regulator advised against raising it by more than 70 per cent. 																								The committee will also provide solutions to problems in extending health insurance without an age limit. 																								It will suggest easier procedures for claim settlement and separate schemes for the elderly.																								Issues relating to health insurance for the elderly need special focus as they are more vulnerable. 																								Most private insurance companies refuse medical insurance policies to people above 60, Banerjee said. He was speaking on the sidelines of an interactive session on health insurance, organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry here today. 																								Among public sector insurers, only Oriental Insurance doesnt have a health insurance policy for senior citizens. But, it has drawn up a plan for senior citizens and is waiting for the regulators approval to launch the product, he added.

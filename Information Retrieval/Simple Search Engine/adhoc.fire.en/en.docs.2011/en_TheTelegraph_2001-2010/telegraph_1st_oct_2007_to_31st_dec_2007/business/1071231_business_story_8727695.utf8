				 Early-bird fee proposal for spectrum

 JAYATI GHOSE
				 	 ALL IN THE RACE
																								New Delhi, Dec. 30: The first entity to pay the telecom licence fee will also be the first to get spectrum, according to a department of telecom (DoT) plan.
																								The DoT is keen to give letters of intent (LoIs) to operators in the first week of January.
																								Officials of the DoT said, Any telecom operator or aspirant who is the first to submit Rs 1,650 crore as the licence fee to convert our letter of intent into a telecom licence, will also be the first to be eligible for the allocation of spectrum, irrespective of when the company applied for the licence. 
																								This means real estate companies such as Parsvnath, which is ninth in the queue for a licence, or Unitech, which is 11th, can go ahead of Idea Cellular or Spice Communications, which are third and fourth, respectively, in the race for spectrum.
																								Idea and Spice have been waiting for an LoI since 2006. Analysts said this would be a great opportunity for cash-rich real estate companies trying to venture into the telecom business. For GSM players free 2G spectrum of 4.4MHz comes with a pan-India license; for CDMA operators it is 2.5 MHz.
																								Under the earlier first come, first served telecom policy, companies were allocated licences in the order in which they applied for the Unified Access Service Licence.
																								DoT will issue LoIs to all 16 companies that had applied for the licence before the government deadline of September 25, 2007. S Tel, Parsvnath Developers, Alliance Infratech, Datacom Solutions, Oswals and Indiabulls have applied for the licence in all 22 circles.
																								The other 10 companies to get LoIs are: ByCell for five circles, Tata Teleservices for three, Idea Cellular for nine, Spice Communications for 20, Swan Telecom for two, Cheetah Corporate Services for 14, HFCL, Shyam Telecom and BPL Mobile for 21 each, and Unitech for eight.
																								Companies would be given 12 days to accept the LoIs and pay the licence fee, the officials said. 
																								They added that by asking applicants to pay the licence fee within a short span of time, the DoT would be able to weed out non-serious players.
																								They, however, said that the entry fee, bank guarantees and other fees would not be refunded if the applicant was found to be ineligible. 
																								The officials are anxious over some companies failing to meet eligibility criteria. The DoT is still trying to clarify shareholding patterns and promoter details of some of the applicants, including Bycell, S Tel, Datacom Solutions, Sing Tel and Alliance Infratech.
																								FM on allocation
																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the judiciary should have a thorough knowledge about spectrum allocation for rendering a proper judgement on the issue, according to a PTI report.
																								Without understanding what the spectrum means, how the allotment is done and what the competition is, we cannot render proper justice on the issue, he said.

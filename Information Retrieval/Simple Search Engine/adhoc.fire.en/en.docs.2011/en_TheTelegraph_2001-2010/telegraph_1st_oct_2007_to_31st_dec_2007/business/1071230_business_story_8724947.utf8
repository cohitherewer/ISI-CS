																								The governments five-year plan to 2011-12 has an ambitious target of 9 per cent average annual growth. Is that a chimera? After a robust growth of 9.4 per cent in 2006-07, growth appeared to be tailing off  especially in the second quarter of this fiscal when GDP growth tumbled to 8.9 per cent from 10.2 per cent in the previous year. Last year, third-quarter growth (October-December) was the slowest  and optimists are betting that last years blip wont be repeated.

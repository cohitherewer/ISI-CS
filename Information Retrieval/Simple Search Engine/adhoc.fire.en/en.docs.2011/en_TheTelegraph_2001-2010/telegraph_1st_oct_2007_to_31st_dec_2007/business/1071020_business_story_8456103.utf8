				 R-Com gets clearance for GSM 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ambani: Reason to cheer																								Mumbai, Oct. 19: Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications (R-Com) has received the department of telecoms (DoT) approval to launch nationwide GSM services. 																								R-Com now offers CDMA services in 20 circles and GSM in eight circles.																								R-Com has been allowed to offer the new services under the DoTs existing unified access service licence. 																								The DoT permission, therefore, fulfils Ambanis vision of offering both GSM and CDMA services to the subscriber. More than a year ago, Ambani had said there would be an enhanced focus on GSM, even as the company would remain technology neutral. 																								As part of the GSM focus, he had also expressed interest in acquiring Hutchison Essar, which was later taken over by the Vodafone group. 																								Analysts said though R-Com will be entering a crowded arena, the GSM roll-out is likely be fast paced as its towers are already in place. 																								Sources close to the company said the launch of nationwide GSM services would not shift the focus away from CDMA. In July, R-Com strengthened its ties with Qualcomm Inc, the CDMA technology provider.

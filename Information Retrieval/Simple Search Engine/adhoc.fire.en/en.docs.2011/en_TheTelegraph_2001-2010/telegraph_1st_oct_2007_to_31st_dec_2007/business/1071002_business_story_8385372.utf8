				 Steel prices raised twice in two months
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 1: Domestic steel companies today increased prices by Rs 500-750 per tonne. This is the second such hike in the last two months.																								Steel prices in India are around Rs 27,500 a tonne, close to their all-time high during March-April, 2006. Prices were as high as Rs 29,500-30,000 per tonne during that period.																								Steel company executives said there was a possibility of prices reaching those heights if input costs continued to rise.																								Todays rise took the cue from global trends. In the US and Europe, benchmark hot-rolled coil prices went up by $40 or Rs 1,600 per tonne.																								However, Indian companies could not match their international peers because of the hardening rupee. They had to keep the hike moderate to maintain import parity.																								The rupee appreciation has knocked off some Rs 600 per tonne from what could have been the increase, an industry executive said.																								All steel stocks were in the red today since the market expected a hike of at least Rs 1,500 per tonne. 																								Companies believe they hardly have any other choice but to raise prices.																								Iron prices in the spot market have gone up and are expected to rise 30 per cent in the long term. 																								Cia Vale do Rio Doce, the Rio Tinto group and BHP Billiton Ltd, the worlds three largest iron-ore exporters, are negotiating for such a hike as China continues to ramp up production at a heady pace.																								According to an estimate, prices for benchmark shipments from Australia may rise to a record $66.40 a tonne next year from $51.47 in 2007.

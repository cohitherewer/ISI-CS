				 Reliance refinery ahead of schedule
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 16: Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) today said work on its Jamnagar refinery was more than 70 per cent complete.																								It said the 27-million-tonne refinery would be completed before December 2008. In a communication issued to the stock exchanges, RPL said work on its projects went swiftly in the previous quarter. 																								Its engineering efforts reached a close-out phase with over 97 per cent cumulative progress. The companys overall procurement progress was more than 92 per cent during the quarter. 																								Moreover, Reliance Petroleum has completed most of the civil works. It said its construction resources are at their peak.																								This engineering progress  achieved within a span of 22 months  reflects the success of the team effort of over 7,500 engineers, who worked from several interconnected locations across the world, the company said.																								Chairman Mukesh Ambani said, The team is geared up to commission the refinery ahead of its initial schedule of December 2008. The company is poised to create a new world record for project implementation in the refining sector.																								RPL said global refining fundamentals had strengthened further and would show good value creation for large and complex refiners. 																								There is a strong demand for transportation fuels worldwide, despite high crude oil prices. There is a shortage of global refining capacity as many proposed refineries are either delayed or cancelled because of schedule or capital cost concerns. Available crude oils are getting heavier and limited additions to global conversion capacity have widened light to heavy differentials.

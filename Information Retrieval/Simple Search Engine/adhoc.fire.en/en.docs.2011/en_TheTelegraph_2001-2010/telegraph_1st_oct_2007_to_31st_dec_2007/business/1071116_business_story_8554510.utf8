				 ICICI Pru in realty push
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 SMART MONEY																								Mumbai, Nov. 15: ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company has launched a real estate securities fund.																								The three-year, close-ended debt fund will invest in real estate and associated sectors.																								The fund will invest around 51 per cent in high yielding debt securities issued by real estate firms and up to 49 per cent in equity of companies engaged in industries that benefit from the sector or invest in property. 																								The sectors that depend on real estate include cement, construction, metals, hotels, retail, banks and finance companies.																								This fund is designed to bring new retail investors into the market. This is a fund for people who expect a fixed deposit plus kind of return and will have a reasonable dose of equity, said Nilesh Shah, deputy managing director and chief investment officer of ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company. 																								Shah, who is also the managing director of ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company, said the retail sector was estimated to grow by 30 per cent over the next five years.																								In India, real estate accounts for less than 5 per cent of the total economy, while it accounts for 13.6 per cent in Singapore, 12 per cent in Hong Kong and 9.42 per cent in Australia. We are confident that many more players like DLF will want to do business in a structured manner, he said. 																								After the RBI stopped banks from lending to real estate players, the sector is willing to borrow money at slightly higher rates, Shah said.

				 UB ups stake in Air Deccan
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Oct. 3: The UB groups open offer to increase its holding in Air Deccan to 46 per cent has been subscribed 1.3 times. 																								The company received 35 million shares against 27 million on offer. 																								In May, the group picked up a 26 per cent stake in Air Deccan for Rs 546 crore. 																								Under Sebis takeover rules, the company had to make an open offer to acquire another 20 per cent stake in Air Deccan.																								The offer, which was managed by Edelweiss Capital, closed on October 1. 																								Air Deccan fares may get costlier as the UB group is trying to pull it out of losses. 																								Kingfisher and Air Deccan fares will go up in the next few weeks so that these two companies dont incur losses. We are not in the business of making losses, Vijay Mallya said. 																								Deccan Aviation shares rose 0.81 per cent to close at Rs 149.95 on the BSE today.

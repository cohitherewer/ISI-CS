				 Rio bidding war to hot up
				 	 Tough competition																								Sydney, Nov. 9 (Reuters): Rio Tintos rejection of a $140-billion all-share offer from BHP Billiton is likely to trigger rival bids from resource companies awash with cash from record commodity and stock prices.																								A marriage of BHP and Rio would create the worlds biggest mining force, capable of controlling the global flow of fleet loads of iron ore, copper, coal and other commodities for industrial use.																								Analysts said BHP Billitons approach might be just the first shot in a battle that could draw in other parties and push up the bidding for Rio to above $170 billion.																								A host of interested parties, from Chinese oil companies to Siberian nickel miners, have the potential to launch rival offers after massive stock market floats have brought companies excess funds, supplying the capital needed to finance a bid.																								If you put together a consortium of Chinese, they could be out there, as well as the Russians, given theres a lot of oil money being generated, said Shaw Stockbroking analyst John Colnan.																								Global mining leader BHP said on Thursday it had approached third-ranked Rio with a 3-for-1 share offer, but Rio was quick to rebuff the offer as too low.																								The BHP offer was initially pitched at a 14.4 per cent premium. Rio shares gained nearly 16 per cent to A$130.90 in Australian trade, while BHP fell 1.8 per cent, putting Rio about 3 per cent above the indicative offer price.																								Rio would not say whether it had received other approaches, although analysts said the companys broad range of operations and healthy profit outlook made it an attractive target.																								The Rio board was open to other offers and a higher BHP bid, said a source familiar with the deal, who asked not to be named.																								Only hours earlier, Rio had mopped up the last of the shares in Canadian aluminium maker Alcan, which it acquired for $38.1 billion after trumping an offer by Alcoa.																								Credit ratings agency Moodys said it might put BHPs rating under review for a possible downgrade if a formal offer was made for Rio, reflecting uncertainties about integration risk, regulatory restrictions and financial policies.																								The global mining boom means both companies are generating piles of cash, with BHP Billiton expected to post 2007-08 net profit of $15.7 billion, while Rio is expected to post profit of about $7.6 billion.

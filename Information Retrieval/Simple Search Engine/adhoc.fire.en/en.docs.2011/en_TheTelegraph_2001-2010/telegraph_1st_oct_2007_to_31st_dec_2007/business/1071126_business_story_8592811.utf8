				 Reliance Power recasts float terms
																								Mumbai, Nov. 25 (PTI): The Anil Ambani group has sought market regulator Sebis nod to float Reliance Powers initial public offering (IPO) at a face value of Rs 10 a share instead of Rs 2 proposed earlier, a move that could hasten the share sale.																								The group wrote to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) earlier last week, seeking permission in this regard.																								Company officials and the spokesperson for Reliance Power could not be contacted for comments. Sebi officials also could not be immediately contacted.																								The communication said the IPO was proposed at a face value of Rs 2 a share to involve a larger number of retail investors, but offered the option of floating the shares at Rs 10 a share in case the earlier proposal did not meet the regulators requirement.																								Largest-ever IPO 																								Reliance Power had filed the draft prospectus for the issue, being pegged as the largest ever IPO in India and the first such public issue from the Anil Ambani group, in early October. 																								However, Sebi is yet to issue its observations that are necessary to go ahead with the offering.																								The company had proposed to issue 130 crore shares of Rs 2 each, which will constitute 11.5 per cent of its share capital. It is estimated to raise $3 billion, more than the countrys biggest IPO so far  that of realty firm DLF  which mopped up over $2 billion.																								The issue proceeds are proposed to be utilised for funding subsidiaries to part-finance the construction and development costs of various projects and for general corporate purposes, the company had stated earlier.																								The IPO by Reliance Power, which recently bagged the 4,000 mega watt Sasan power project, is considered to be a part of a revenue mobilisation exercise for its estimated Rs 1,00,000 crore investment plans. 																								Reliance Energy and AAA project, an Anil Ambani group holding firm, hold 50 per cent each in the company.

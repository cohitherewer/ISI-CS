				 Institutions in queue for UB shares

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Mumbai, Dec. 7: Vijay Mallyas United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL) has raised Rs 600 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offer that was oversubscribed by 2.6 times. 
																								The company will issue 5,405,405 equity shares at a price of Rs 1,110 each on a face value of Rs 10 per share under the offering that opened on December 4. 
																								Institutional investors have decided to invest at a price that is close to the market price of the shares. 
																								The funds raised from the QIP issue will be used to meet the companys requirements, including paying portions of existing debt and making additional investments for our existing businesses directly or through investee companies, Ravi Nedungadi, president and group chief financial officer of UB Group, said. 
																								UBHL is the primary investment arm of the group. Through its controlling stakes in United Spirits, United Breweries, Kingfisher Airlines and Deccan Aviation, it is a key player in the fast growing consumer space. Nedungadi added. The QIP issue received a good response from top-quality institutional investors and was comfortably oversubscribed, he said.
																								It has been our privilege to be associated with yet another successful transaction for UB Group. This has been achieved through a combination of the companys performance and the conviction demonstrated by institutional investors, said Pankaj Agrawal, senior managing director and head of investment banking at CLSA, which worked as the global coordinator and book running lead manager for the offering.

				 Mobile handsets to get cheaper
 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA																								Calcutta, Nov. 5: Those planning to buy mobile phones have reasons to cheer. Handset prices have been falling steadily and the trend is expected to continue.																								Prices of models such as Samsung E250 fell 33.72 per cent, Motorola W205, 24.4 per cent, Nokia 5300, 40 per cent, Nokia N95, 31.6 per cent and Sony Ericsson W880I, 32 per cent.																								Consumers are ready to pay a premium to purchase models at the time of their launch. While some companies introduce limited numbers to maintain exclusivity, distributors drop the margins after the initial few weeks, said trade experts.																								The booming grey market has also led to the price fall. Nine crore handsets with original batteries are expected to be sold this calendar year. 																								The replacement battery market will be at 4-4.5 crore, around 70 per cent of which will be counterfeit products, said Pankaj Mohindroo, president of the Indian Cellular Association. 																								Even handsets which have been rejected by users in other countries are smuggled into the domestic market. The entry of Taiwanese and Chinese handset manufacturers looking to set up base here will also slash handset prices further. ZTE Telecom of China is planning a $50-million global manufacturing hub in India.																								We welcome competition, be it from any quarter, as it helps to expand the market. Consumers ultimately go for the brand value. We keep a continuous check on our prices to ensure that our products are competitively priced, said Lloyd Mathias, marketing director of Motorola India.																								Often the launch of a high-end model pushes down the prices of cheaper handsets. Companies also reduce the prices in one segment when they shift focus to another.																								Local sourcing of components has also led to the price fall. Nokia has seven component manufacturers in the Nokia Telecom Park in Tamil Nadu. Of these Salcomp and Perlos have started shipping chargers to Nokia India since June 2007. Four more will be operational before December.

				 Ranbaxy net up 48%
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 18: Ranbaxy Laboratories has posted a net profit of Rs 207 crore for the quarter ended September 30, a 48 per cent increase over Rs 140 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.																								Quarterly sales rose marginally to Rs 1,652 crore from Rs 1,640 crore a year ago, the company said. 																								The increase in profit was attributed to gains in foreign exchange transactions and improved sales in east Europe.																								At the board meeting held today, the Ranbaxy directors gave an in-principle approval to the proposed demerger of its drug discovery and research operations into a separate entity.																								The proposed demerger of our drug discovery and research operations will provide greater flexibility and impetus to our research arm while unlocking value for the company and its shareholders, said Ranbaxy CEO Malvinder Mohan Singh.																								With the proposed demerger, Ranbaxy will join peers such as Dr Reddys Laboratories and Sun Pharma, which have hived off their R amp;D operations into new entities. 																								Other drug firms, including Mumbai-based Nicholas Piramal, are also planning to demerge their R amp;D arms. 																								The company attributed revenue growth during the third quarter to increase in business from emerging markets that contributed nearly 54 per cent to its global sales. 																								India, Ukraine, South Africa and Brazil were the main drivers of growth in the emerging markets, it said. 																								Revenues in emerging markets during the quarter under review were up 17 per cent. 																								The company declared an interim dividend of Rs 2.5 on a share of Rs 5 each (50 per cent) for its shareholders. 																								Biocon numbers 																								Biocon Ltd has posted a profit after tax of Rs 107 crore for the half year ended September 30, 2007, registering a growth of 27 per cent over last years Rs 84 crore. Consolidated revenue grew 19 per cent at Rs 553 crore over last years Rs 463 crore.

				 Capgemini ahead of hiring target

 A STAFF REPORTER
				 	 Recruitment drive
																								Calcutta, Dec. 18: Capgemini Consulting India could reach its 2010 hiring target ahead of time. 
																								The French IT consulting and offshoring major originally planned to hire 40,000 by 2010. But now it is looking at recruiting 30,000 employees by the end of 2008.
																								Since we are set to reach our national target by 2008, the number at the end of 2010 could be significantly higher than the initial target of 40,000, said Gautam Mukherjee, director of Capgemini Consulting India.
																								Mukherjee was speaking on the sidelines of a round table discussion organised by Ficci on EU-India trade and investment development programme.
																								If the company significantly exceeds its current recruitment target, it would be second to IBM, which had around 53,000 employees in the country at the end of last year, which is expected to go up to 73,000 by the end of this year. 
																								In terms of size, the Indian operations are set to become the largest for the Paris-based consultant by the end of 2008.
																								The growth at its Calcutta centre would be commensurate with its national progress.
																								Capgemini has 17,000 people in India, the second largest after France.
																								We do not follow the campus model and globally just have one in Paris. Therefore, we look at leased spaces for expansion, said Mukherjee.
																								In its past 18 months, Calcutta has touched a headcount of 500 and will end 2007 with a workforce of 900.
																								Capgemini has taken up 50,000 sq ft in the DLF IT hub in New Town Rajarhat and will eventually consolidate its city operations from that centre.
																								In the first half of the year, the Calcutta operation experienced a growth of 70 per cent.
																								India as a geography accounts for around 5 per cent of the companys revenue and profits of the company buoyed by 49 per cent in the first half of the year.

				 Local rival emerges for ECBs
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Tough competition																								New Delhi, Nov. 11: The government is exploring the possibility of setting up specialised rupee debt funds for Indian companies investing in local infrastructure.																								Officials said such funds would go a long way in curbing the tendency among companies to tap global markets for loans. One such instrument is external commercial borrowings (ECBs), on which the government regularly imposes curbs to limit their inflow.																								A part of the foreign loans of companies is used for working capital and the purchase of machinery within the country.																								Government officials said, External commercial borrowings meant to finance purchase of capital goods from abroad or meant for investments abroad are the kind of loan flows we want to encourage. 																								Dollar borrowing for rupee spending is what we would like to discourage as this simply makes the Indian currency stronger, without being of much help to the Indian industry, the officials said.																								The reason for Indian industry going abroad for funds is cheaper interest rates compared with the local market. 																								Firms investing in infrastructure projects need cheap, long-term loans that are difficult to obtain within the country. Rupee debt funds, therefore, will provide a viable alternative to companies.																								Foreign loans are a major component of the huge inflow of foreign exchange that have raised the value of the rupee against the dollar. The Indian currency, at 39.32 to the dollar on Thursday, has risen about 12.5 per cent this year.																								The huge inflows have created a problem of plenty: the domestic economy is awash with cash that is putting pressure on prices, while the rising rupee has eroded the competitiveness of Indian exports. 																								One way of setting up rupee funds is by registering them as venture capital funds, under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. 																								Such funds could list themselves on bourses after a period of time, leaving exit avenues for initial investors.																								Officials said if these funds were to be successful, certain tax concessions might be needed to make them lucrative to banks and financial institutions. Changes would also be needed in the rules governing insurance and provident fund companies, to allow them to deploy funds.																								We expect investments in large infrastructure projects including special purpose vehicles meant to finance public-private partnership projects such as airports, ports and highways, officials said.

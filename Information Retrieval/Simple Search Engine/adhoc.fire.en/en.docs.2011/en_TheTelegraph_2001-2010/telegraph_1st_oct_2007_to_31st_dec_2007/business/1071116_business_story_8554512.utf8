				 Auction of coal blocks for captive use
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 MINE GAME																								New Delhi, Nov. 15: The Cabinet will allow the auction of coal mines to steel mills, power plants and cement factories for captive use. At present, coal-bearing areas are allocated to steel mills and power plants by the Centre, but questions on transparency arise in such exercises.																								Officials said amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development amp; Regulation) Act 1957 would be brought before the Rajya Sabha to introduce competitive bidding for coal blocks.																								A coal ministry note said the competitive bidding would be based on technical, physical and financial parameters. 																								Part of the money from the auction will be earmarked for rehabilitation and community development projects in the coal-bearing areas, which are mostly on tribal lands. 																								There have been tribal unrest in the past in coal-rich states such as Jharkhand and Orissa over land acquisition. 																								Under the new law, the blocks will not be allocated unless they are explored in detail and the quality and quantity of extractable coal reserves assessed. The cost of this exploration will be recovered from the winning bidder.																								The new bidding system will provide for both financial stakes as well as penalties for not developing the mines. Bidders that offer the highest production share to the state will get the mine. 																								Successful bidders will have to give a bank guarantee equal to three years of the production share. If the mine is not developed in time these guarantees will be encashed and the lease cancelled. 																								Paddy push																								To encourage farmers to grow more paddy, the government has announced an incentive bonus of Rs 50 per quintal for the kharif season in addition to the support price announced earlier.

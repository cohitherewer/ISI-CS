				 Inox scripts growth plans
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 11: Inox Leisure Ltd will invest Rs 500 crore to set up 63 multiplexes with 248 screens across the country by 2010.																								Inox Leisure, which is a subsidiary of Gujarat Fluorochemicals, has 21 multiplexes with 72 screens.																								India has the highest ticket sales in cinema globally. However, the country has an insufficient number of screens compared with the population. 																								There are 13 screens per million population in India against 50 screens per million in China and 36 screens per million in the US.																								We see a tremendous potential in the country, especially in Tier II cities. These properties have been signed up for long lease at various malls so that we have cover against fluctuating real estate prices, said Alok Tandon, chief operating officer at Inox Leisure Limited.																								The company will use the proceeds from its initial public offering to fund its expansion plans.																								Inox is also betting big on the growth of organised retail in the country. It has the first right of refusal at any Pantaloon site to set up multiplexes. Bengal will have 16 Inox outlets with 60 screens by 2010.																								Exhibition venues are important in the $2-billion Indian film industry, which earns more than 70 per cent of its revenues from domestic and international ticket sales.																								In developed markets such as the US, only 35 per cent of the film industrys revenues come from box office sales while the rest is from sale of DVDs and film rights to cable and satellite television companies.																								Inox stands a close second to PVR Cinemas. 																								Movie exhibition companies such as PVR and Shringar Cinemas have expanded in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.																								Inox, however, has decided to set up properties only in states which offer tax exemptions in entertainment. Such exemptions are given for five years. These exemptions generate savings of 30 to 40 per cent.																								Only 5 per cent of Inoxs ticket sales fall under the tax purview compared with 20 per cent for PVR. Inox, therefore, enjoys a higher operating margin of more than 35 per cent. Inox posted a profit after tax of Rs 24 crore last fiscal.																								Tandon says digital screening will help expand the market of organised screening by making films available in remote areas. 																								Inox is also into film financing and distribution. Tandon said the film industry would become more structured with entertainment companies looking at a 360 degree model of production, distribution and exhibition.

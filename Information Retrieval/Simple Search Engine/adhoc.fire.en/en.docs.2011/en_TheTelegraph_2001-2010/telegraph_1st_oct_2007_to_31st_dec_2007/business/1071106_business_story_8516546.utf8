				 Orissa complex of IOC in five years
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Nov. 5: The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) expects to commission its petrochemical complex in Orissa by 2012. The Rs 26,000-crore project will come up near the Paradip port and construction is expected to start early next year.																								Indian Oil chairman Sarthak Behuria met Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik today and apprised him of the progress on the project. We have a commitment to spend Rs 2,000 crore this fiscal, Behuria said.																								Patnaik has assured the Indian Oil chairman that the Orissa Value Added Tax Act will be amended so that the public sector oil company can enjoy tax benefits.																								On February 16, 2004, the Orissa government had signed a memorandum of understanding with the IOC, granting a package of incentives. These include a deferment of sales tax; an exemption from central sales tax and entry tax on crude oil and project construction materials; and a waiver of sales tax on the purchase of materials. 																								Since sales taxes have been replaced by value added taxes, the IOC never enjoyed any tax relief. 																								The project, originally conceptualised as a Rs 7,500-crore refinery, had been scaled up to an export-oriented refinery with a capacity of 15 million tonnes per annum, and a petrochemical plant.

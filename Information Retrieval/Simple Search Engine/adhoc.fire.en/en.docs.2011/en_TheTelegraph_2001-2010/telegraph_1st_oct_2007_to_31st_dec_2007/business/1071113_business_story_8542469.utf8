				 Shares continue downhill journey
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, Nov. 12: The 30-scrip sensex today plummeted 170.33 points to settle at 18737.27, continuing the bear run on the bourses for the sixth consecutive trading session. 																								Local shares are facing the heat from the US sub-prime crisis and its impact on Asia. 																								The realty and IT stocks received the worst blows, plunging 3.08 and 2.78 per cent respectively today. Almost all the Asian benchmark indices ended in red today with the Dow Jones falling 1.69 per cent, S amp;P tumbling 1.43 per cent and Japans Nikkei sliding down 2.48 per cent. The 50-share NSE stocks were down 0.81 per cent at 5617.10. The sensex had fallen by almost 7.4 per cent off its lifetime high of 20238.16 hit on October 30. 																								As the US market was closed today, we cant attribute todays fall much to global cues. However, the Cisco quarterly results are clearly suggesting some slowdown in the US economy. The Indian investors have only reacted to the fall in other Asian indices today. The midcap and smallcap stocks are getting buyers at this level as their results have been relatively better than the bluechips. If Walmart and Home Depot come out with positive results tomorrow, we may again see a trigger to the market, said Amitabh Chakraborty, president (equity) at Religare Enterprises. 																								While realty and IT led the fall today, technology, oil amp; gas and auto remained other prominent losers, dropping 2.71, 2.28 and 1.87 per cent respectively. While realty giant DLF swooned by 4.67 per cent at Rs 871.20, countrys largest private sector company Reliance Industries fell 2.15 per cent to Rs 2,676.95, and Reliance Energy Ltd lost 1.04 per cent at Rs 1,818.90. 																								Shares in software services firms fell as disappointing news from technology companies like Cisco in the US raised concerns that the fallout from the credit crisis was hurting demand from key customers. 																								Among technology shares, Infosys stumbled by 3.6 per cent to Rs 1,641.95, TCS dropped by 2.21 per cent to Rs 963.70.

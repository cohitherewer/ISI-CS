				 Rio Tinto plans tech, commodity hubs
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 25: Mining multinational Rio Tinto plans to use the country as a sourcing hub for refined commodities, information technology work and BPO activities, according to Nik Senapati, chief executive of the companys Indian arm. 																								The London-based company, which is present in India since the mid eighties, has three offices in the country in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai. 																								Senapati also said the companys diamond exploration work in Madhya Pradesh was at an advanced stage. 																								Among the seven states where we have undertaken diamond exploration, Chattrapur in Madhya Pradesh is where the prospecting work has advanced the most, he said. Asked how soon the process would be complete, Senapati said it would depend on when the company received clearance from the government.																								Now everything has to be permitted by the Supreme Court. The ministry of environment and forest alone cannot give the nod, he said.																								If the company found proven reserves with advance exploration techniques, it would require about $500 million to develop a diamond mine.																								Rio Tinto has three diamond mines across the world. Senapati said it took between 8 and 14 years to begin commercial production in a diamond mine.																								The company is looking for diamonds in Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. 																								It started diamond exploration in 2000 and has spent more than $21 million on the search.																								The company has uncovered several interesting prospects and these are being evaluated. South Africa, India and Australia have similar geological constituents because these three countries were formed from the Gondowanaland supercontinent, explained Senapati. 																								More than 80 per cent of raw diamond imports to India comes from the companys three diamond plants in Australia, Canada and Zimbabwe. 																								Senapati said the company, which is the worlds second largest exporter of iron ore, was also keen on the sector.

				 Temasek backs GSM camp
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 29: Temasek, the Singapore state investment company, today asked the government not to go ahead with the proposed hike in subscriber base for additional spectrum. 																								It feels such a move will curb expansion in the worlds fastest-growing wireless market. The proposals by the Telecom Engineering Centre risk making private operators sub-scale, when they have a real window of opportunity to be global champions, Ho Ching, executive director and CEO of Temasek Holdings, said in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 																								Domestic private mobile operators are already some of the most spectrum-constrained in the world, he added. As a long-term investor in India, it is my sincere suggestion that you invite your regulators to consider the best practices and strategies around the world. We will be happy to play our part to help facilitate any exchanges with other regulators, said Ching.																								He added that it was the prerogative of the regulatory authorities to decide on the spectrum allocation.																								Wireless spectrum is perhaps the most critical element of an operators ability to increase coverage and provide the right quality of service, Ho Ching wrote in the letter. Temasek has a presence in sectors such as telecom, finance and infrastructure. It is a major investor in SingTel, which has about a 30 per cent equity in Sunil Mittal-promoted Bharti Airtel. 																								Prior to Temasek, Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin, R-Com chairman Anil Ambani and former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu have sent letters to Singh, putting forward their views on the spectrum conundrum.

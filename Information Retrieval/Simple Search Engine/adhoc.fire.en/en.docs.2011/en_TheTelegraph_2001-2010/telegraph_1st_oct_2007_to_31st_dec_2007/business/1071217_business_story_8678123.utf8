				 Mutuals line up realty offers

 ANIRUDH LASKAR 
																								Mumbai, Dec. 16: Mutual funds are finally driving a stake into the ground  literally.
																								Come 2008, asset management companies in the country plan to come out with a string of real estate mutual funds to tap the potential of a sector thats been yielding very good returns on investment for several years.
																								In July 2006, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) permitted the launch of real estate mutual funds (REMFs). 
																								However, the regulator is still in the process of finalising investment guidelines for the funds, which are expected in early January.
																								SBI Mutual Fund will be among the first to launch an REMF. 
																								The fund will invest in real estate properties and provide project financing. 
																								It will also invest in the equity of some real estate companies. 
																								Although the investment objective sounds simple and attractive, mobilising the money across realty assets to generate competitive returns might not be a simple task as the segment is largely unregulated. 
																								Investing in the real estate sector needs a lot of expertise. The sector is still not organised, and it is going to be a challenge to pick the best investment pockets, Syed Shahabuddin, managing director and CEO of SBI Mutual Fund, told The Telegraph. 
																								Shahabuddin admitted that returns from these funds might not be as good as other equity-oriented funds. 
																								Growth story
																								According to an industry report, the domestic real estate market, which has been estimated at about $14 billion as of March 2007, is growing at 30 per cent a year.
																								Moodys Investor Services expects the market to grow to over $90 billion by 2015.
																								The BSE realty index has surged by about 60 per cent over the past year to 12400.46 points from about 7755.65 as on December 14. 
																								We are expecting to raise about Rs 1,000 crore from our real estate mutual fund offer, Shahabuddin said.
																								The REMFs will typically have a three-year lock-in period and Shahabuddin reckons they may yield a 20 per cent compound annual growth rate.
																								Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research, which tracks mutual funds, is more optimistic. 
																								An REMF has the potential to generate 30 to 40 per cent returns on an annualised basis. But the returns would largely depend on the quality of projects that are financed by the AMC and also the value of the stocks that are purchased, Kumar said. 
																								There is a standard risk associated with every real estate project and this poses a higher liquidity risk for an REMF,he added.
																								ICICI Prudential
																								ICICI Prudential Asset Management is also planning to come out with its offering in this space.
																								We have already started working on our first REMF as the fund will add a lot of value to our product portfolio, said Nilesh Shah, deputy-managing director of ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company.
																								Shah believes that the real estate investment will entail different skill sets. 
																								Ideally, seed capital should be allocated to study the sector before launching an REMF, Shah added.
																								The sector will take some time to mature. India does not have an organised valuation system. Property valuation will be the deciding factor in launching REMFs. 
																								Real estate sector projects have higher gestation periods and investors cannot expect to make a quick buck.

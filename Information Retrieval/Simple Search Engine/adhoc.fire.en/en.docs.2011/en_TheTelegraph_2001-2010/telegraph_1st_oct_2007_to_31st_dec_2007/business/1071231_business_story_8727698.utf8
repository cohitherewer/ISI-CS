				 FDI alarm system in the works

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY
New Delhi, Dec. 30: The government plans to scrap its current policy that virtually bars foreign direct investment (FDI) from certain undesirable countries.
																								In its place, it is looking to establish an early warning system that will automatically latch on to certain FDI proposals and mark them down for scrutiny on security considerations.
																								The new policy will set clearly defined triggers and investment thresholds based on how sensitive the sector is, the level of investment and the entities that are planning to make the investment.
																								Top officials said the government would introduce a policy that would ensure a hard scrutiny of proposals made by companies that are in some way linked with entities that have already been identified by the security agencies as suspect.
																								Investment in vulnerable areas such as telecom, ports, airlines, airport and stock exchanges will be also subject to security checks.
																								Similarly, investments in sensitive areas such as the Northeast or Andamans islands will also have to pass security screening. 
																								The government is also considering security screening of very large investment inflows beyond a certain threshold in any given project. 
																								Mega mergers and acquisitions that involve large foreign investment will also have to undergo stringent scrutiny.
																								The current policy of barring foreign investment from certain countries is being jettisoned as this has been attracting flak abroad. Officials say they are trying to balance the need for security clearances with the imperative of ensuring an open house for foreign investments. 
																								It is also considering a legislation on National Security Exclusion Clause, under which any company can be asked to suspend operations or be taken over or shut down in the interest of national security.
																								Once the policy suggestions are finally accepted, acquisitions in the telecom space such as the Vodafone takeover of Hutch-Essar, could in the future come under a security scanner. 
																								Officials said suspect entities would include terror organisations, which often operate in the open market through front companies and intelligence agencies and armies of certain countries that run commercial organisations. 
																								The Pakistani and Chinese armies, for instance, are believed to have several frontal commercial organisations. 
																								Although there was no established policy for such scrutiny earlier, investigations were conducted whenever officials felt they were needed. 
																								Chinese telecom companies such as Huawei and infrastructure builders such as Hutchison Ports have not been given security clearances for investing in projects in India before. 
																								Although Hutchison Ports figured among the companies that were shortlisted by the Mumbai Port to set up two offshore container terminals, the home ministry dithered on issuing a security clearance and eventually refused to grant it.
																								Hutchison Ports also lost out on the new terminal to be set up in Chennai, which is now being constructed by Singapore Port Authority. 
																								The home ministry had refused to clear exploration plans for some blocks in Assam, where Oil India Limited (OIL) wanted to hire drilling rigs from a Chinese company, which had turned out to be the lowest bidder. Similarly, seismic surveys were also held up as OIL was keen to hire equipment from a Chinese company to carry out the work. 
																								India has seen an upsurge in foreign investment over the past few years. In 2006-07, the country saw a record FDI inflow of $15.7 billion, while the government has set an FDI target for $25 billion for this year. 
																								This is one of the reasons why the government is reworking the process of granting security clearances to foreign investments.
																								There are also moves to relax FDI norms in certain areas of aviation such as helicopter services, cargo and charter air services. 
																								It also plans to allow overseas investment in commodity exchanges and townships.

																								Calcutta, Dec. 19: Ambuja Realtys 10-year contract with Carlsons Hotel Worldwide for Ffort Radisson will come up for review next month.
																								Under the contract, which will expire this year, Ambuja uses Carlsons Radisson brand. Carlson is launching its own Radisson hotel in the city with another city-based developer next month.
																								We are going to discuss this in a months time as the contract, which started in 1997, is up for renewal, said Harsh Neotia, chairman of Ambuja Realty.
																								We are open to renewing the contract if the terms and conditions remain the same. However, usually after 10 years, a contract undergoes a revision. We have to then see how it works out for us before taking any decision, he added.
																								Usually such contracts have a barring clause of five to 10km. Ffort is 50km away from Calcutta, so that is not a problem. The profile of the properties will be different. Ffort is a resort, while the city property could be a luxury hotel, Neotia added. Ffort Radisson is a luxury resort styled on an old fort theme complete with a moat and is spread over 60 acres of landscaped greenery.
																								Ambuja will also begin talks with other hospitality brands for partnership in two hotels, which will be ready in the next one and half years in New Town Rajarhat and Siliguri.
																								The existing City Centre in Salt Lake has been built over 4 lakh sq ft. The Haldia and Raipur centres will come up over a similar area, while the New Town one will be slightly bigger at a built-up space of 4.5 lakh sq ft. The Siliguri centre will be bigger than this.
																								The New Town City Centre will be the first of its kind with a 150-room hotel and a butterfly park with a combination of the usual retail stores and the more exotic perfumeries, chocolatiere and candle shops.
																								Alliances for other hospitality projects, including one in the Sunderbans which is waiting for sanctions, a heritage property in north Calcutta and a tea tourism project, are also on the anvil.

				 Haier bets big on India
 GARIMA SINGH NEOGY																								New Delhi, Nov. 10: Haier Appliances (India), a wholly owned subsidiary of the China-based consumer durable company, is targeting a turnover of more than Rs 1,000 crore by 2010.																								The company also plans to turn its recently acquired manufacturing base in Pune into an export hub. It took over the facility from Anchor Daewoo for an undisclosed amount.																								Given our current expansion plans, we should do business in excess of Rs 1,000 crore by 2010 and have a market share of around 10-15 per cent each across all product categories, said Pranay Dhabhai, whole-time director and chief operating officer of Haier India.																								The company is eyeing a turnover of Rs 350 crore this year compared with Rs 320 crore in 2006. Haier also plans to launch a range of products next year and concentrate on export.																								We will expand our range of products and introduce small appliances such as mixers, toasters, grinders, water heaters, commercial freezers and air-conditioners, Dhabhai said. 																								Haier plans to start exporting refrigerators to West Asia, Africa, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the next two years. Colour televisions and washing machines will also be exported to Bangladesh.																								Haier has tied up with retail chains such as Metro, Reliance, Croma, Next and e-Zone and is betting big on the retail format to boost sales. We have 150 distributors and 800-900 dealers. By the end of the next calendar year, we aim to have 4,500 selling points, said Dhabhai.																								Haier Appliances has a 40-acre facility in Pune with a capacity of 3.5 lakh units. The company, which manufactures refrigerators in this plant, has been able to tap only two-thirds of the units current capacity.

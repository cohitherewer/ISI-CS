				 Jaguar chooses to keep all waiting

 AMIT ROY 
																								London, Dec. 21: The Ford motor companys announcement of a preferred bidder for Jaguar and Land Rover was not made today as had been thought. 
																								Although there is near unanimity that Tata is Fords preferred choice, against rival bids from Mahindra amp; Mahindra and the US-based private equity firm One Equity Partner, it now looks as though the announcement will be deferred until the New Year. 
																								As offices in Britain shut down today to allow officegoers to do last minute Christmas shopping, a silence fell over the Jaguar and Land Rover plants in the Midlands. Only people in security were left to answer the phones. 
																								Tata executives may have come to London to conclude the talks but even senior management from Ford, Jaguar and Land Rover will be demob happy and in no mood to finalise what appears to be a complicated deal. 
																								According to todays FT, the successful bidder would have to sign an estimated 40 contracts as part of the takeover, ranging from engine production to the operation of information technology systems. There could be several more sticking points that could undo a deal, such as the cost of complying with stricter emissions regulations in Europe and whether the successful bidder would be permitted to use intellectual property belonging to Jaguar and Land Rover in other parts of the group. 
																								The paper said: This would be tricky for Tata Motors, which is expected to reap significant technology transfer benefits from the takeover. 
																								There is a fundamental difference in the atmosphere now and that which obtained earlier this year when Tata Steel and Brazils CSN were involved in an intense struggle to buy Corus, the Anglo-Dutch group. 
																								A banker who was involved in advising Tata Steel at the time told The Telegraph that Tata Motors were keen to buy Jaguar and Land Rover but not at any cost. He implied that on the earlier occasion, Rata Tata had placed his personal prestige on the line. 
																								Jaguar and Land Rover are two prestigious British brands for whom Ford is seeking a price of about Dollar2billion. The new car market in Britain is currently depressed. 
																								Ford put the two brands up for sale earlier this year after posting its biggest loss in the companys 103-year history last year. Ford has said it wants to conclude the sale by early next year, but the pension deficit at the two marques is thought to have been a major issue. 
																								With Ford likely to retain a significant minority stake, the value to the US company of any sale could be more than swallowed up by an estimated Pound1 billion pension deficit.

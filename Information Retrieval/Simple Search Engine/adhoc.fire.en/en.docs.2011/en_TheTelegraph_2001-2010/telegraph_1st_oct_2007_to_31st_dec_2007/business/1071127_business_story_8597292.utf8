				 Chief of sick PSU revival board quits
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: Prahlad K. Basu, chairman of the Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE), today resigned alleging lack of commitment on the part of the government towards the modernisation and restructuring of sick public sector units.																								Basu has faxed his resignation letter to Santosh Mohan Dev, Union minister for heavy industries and public enterprises, and sent copies to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.																								Devs move to bring a former Trinamul Congress leader on the BRPSE board perhaps led to Basus resignation.																								You are anxious to induct a former Trinamul Congress politician without any domain expertise in public enterprises  thereby underscoring the departments lack of commitment to support BRPSE in carrying out its mandate, he said in the letter, a copy of which is available with The Telegraph.																								Stating that the board should be manned by professional persons, Basu wrote, I had requested you ... that at the very minimum, a new secretary, with the necessary competence and commitment, be appointed. However, I now understand (informally) that you are reluctant to take such a step.																								He said the board had become a dumping ground for people with little domain experience.																								Basu claimed that under his leadership, the board was able to turn around 51 PSUs, which were loss making but potentially viable.																								The department of public sector enterprises (DPE) seems to be pursuing a much more narrow agenda, in which governance and reform of PSUs do not figure and closure is seen as the only solution for loss-making PSUs, he said.																								Basu, who had worked with the World Bank and United Nations, said, Herein lies the difference between us (him and Dev) and one that we cannot resolve given the set of incentives that appear to be motivating DPEs stance on PSU reform.																								DPEs unwillingness to support the BRPSE in delivering its mandate has made it almost impossible for me to carry out my job, he added.																								Basu said public sector enterprises did not have a level-playing field, which was the main reason for these units slipping into the red.

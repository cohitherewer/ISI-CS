				 Microsoft, R-Com sign $500m Internet TV deal 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 R-Com chairman Anil Ambani and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in Mumbai on Monday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Nov. 5: Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications has signed a $500-million deal with Microsoft to provide internet television and allied services to Indian consumers from March 2008.																								The service will be powered by Microsofts Mediaroom Internet protocol television (IPTV) software.																								This partnership is unique in three ways: first, the scale of deployment and the time frame for the same are very unique; second, the cost parameters are extreme so that we get to all of the 100 million plus households who have a television today and the most unique part of this partnership is the fact that this is the first time that Microsoft has entered into an exclusive tieup like this, said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.																								Reliance Communications will spend another $500 million on the infrastructure for the venture. 																								Reliance Communications has the exclusive deployment rights for the platform in India. Starting with Mumbai and Delhi, Reliance plans to roll out its IPTV service in the top 30 cities after the two metro rollouts by the end of 2008. The company, however, did not give any details on the pricing of the set-top boxes or of the content. 																								I am glad we are announcing this here today and am sure Bill Gates will be happy with all the work that is being done, Anil Ambani, chairman of Reliance Communications, said.																								Ambani also said the company had started talks with several state governments, including Bengal, to roll out rural broadband services.																								We want to bring the broadband experience to the masses in co-operation with the state governments and the NGOs. I am happy to say that Steve is equally excited about pursuing something on that front, Ambani said. 																								Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) is the delivery of broadcast-quality television and video signals to subscribers over a broadband connection using the Internet Protocol (IP). 																								While IP stands for the Internet protocol, this does not actually mean that television content is streaming over the Internet. Content bottleneck, regulatory issues, and competition from incumbent TV services, in particular, cable TV, are among the obstacles that the IPTV industry faces. 																								According to reports, India is the worlds No. 3 cable TV market and is set to become Asias most lucrative pay TV market by 2015. In India, BSNL, MTNL, and Bharti are a few other players in the IPTV market.																								Spectrum row																								Anil Ambani, whose Reliance Communications is a key CDMA mobile player, today said the Cellular Operators Association of India did not represent the telecom industry and their propaganda on spectrum allocation was misleading.																								Initially five companies out of nine took the matter to the apex tribunal TDSAT. I believe two of them have already dissociated from the case and only three are left, Ambani said.

				 Split verdict 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 17: The move to clamp down on P-notes has split the investing community.																								Foreign institutional investors, who have been driving the markets, are appalled by the way the government and the market regulator are trying to control capital inflows into the country, while local investors think the restrictions will be good for the country in the medium to long term.																								Foreign brokerage CLSA summed the mood of foreign investors when it said Sebis move would have an adverse impact on near-term flows and could dampen the sentiment of foreign investors in the longer term. It reckons that if the proposals are implemented in toto, a substantial chunk of Indian equity held through P-notes will have to be sold over an 18-month period.																								Sebi has estimated the aggregate outstanding positions in P-notes at Rs 3.53 trillion ($88 billion), of which $29 billion is in underlying derivatives, as of August this year. 																								Local pundits have a different take on the issue.																								These experts say the market regulator is not trying to dissuade foreign investors from investing in India, but is only encouraging them to first register and then start investing. Over the past many months, both the Reserve Bank of India and Sebi have been expressing apprehensions over the manner in which PNs are operated. Their biggest concern is that the investor is able to mask his identity.																								These measures may be bad for the stock markets immediately, but over the medium to long term, it is beneficial as the regulator will know who the buyer of a security is, says Dilip Davda an analyst. 																								However, there are others who disagree with Davda. The markets growth has always been a function of capital flows into India. If the government wants to moderate the capital inflows through these kind of directives, I dont think the market will be able to recapture the same dramatic growth that we have seen over the last three months, said Manish Sonthalia of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.																								Bank and certain metal stocks were the most hit as they had a high component of holding through these P-notes.

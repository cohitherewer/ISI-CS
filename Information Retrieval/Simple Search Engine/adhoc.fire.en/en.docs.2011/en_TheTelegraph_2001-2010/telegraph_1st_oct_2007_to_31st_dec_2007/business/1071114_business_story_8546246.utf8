				 Equity bar stays on foreign airlines
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Praful Patel in New Delhi on Tuesday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha																								New Delhi, Nov. 13: The government will continue to bar foreign airlines from picking up stakes in domestic carriers.																								Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said at the Economic Editors conference here today that foreign airlines would be allowed to invest on further maturity of the domestic market. 																								However, he did not specify any yardstick for judging the maturity of the market. 																								The finance ministry and the Planning Commission have been advocating a hike in the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in aviation, which is 49 per cent, and the entry of foreign airlines as minority partners in domestic entities.																								On the other hand, the civil aviation ministry, backed by established domestic players such as Jet and Indian Airlines, feels foreign airlines are interested in India merely to feed their global routes.																								The ministry has opposed the move at meetings of the group of ministers on aviation and before government officials who were reviewing the caps on foreign investment in various sectors.																								Civil aviation ministry officials, however, said the government would allow the FDI ceiling in seaplanes, helicopter services, cargo and non-scheduled air services to be raised to 74 per cent.																								Gati pact																								Global logistics company Gati today joined hands with Air India to launch a freighter service. This is the first public-private-partnership in the air-cargo segment. The first of the five freighters was launched today and will operate on the Delhi-Mumbai-Bangalore-Delhi sector.

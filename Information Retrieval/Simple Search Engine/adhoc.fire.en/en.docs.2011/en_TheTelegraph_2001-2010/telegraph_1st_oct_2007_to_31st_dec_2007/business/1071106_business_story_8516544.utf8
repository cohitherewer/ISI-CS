				 Stocks feel the heat
 OUR BUREAUMumbai, Nov. 5: Stock markets around the world swooned on Monday as fears of widening credit market losses in the US grew after Citigroup Inc announced it might write down an additional $11 billion.																								The Bombay Stock Exchange sensex fell 385.45, or 1.9 per cent, to 19590.78 with frontline stocks such as ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries leading the retreat.

Japans Nikkei 225 stock average slid 1.5 per cent while Hong Kongs Hang Seng index slumped 5 per cent, its worst fall since 2001. Except Taiwan and the Philippines, all Asian markets declined today and the weakness spread to Europe in early trades.

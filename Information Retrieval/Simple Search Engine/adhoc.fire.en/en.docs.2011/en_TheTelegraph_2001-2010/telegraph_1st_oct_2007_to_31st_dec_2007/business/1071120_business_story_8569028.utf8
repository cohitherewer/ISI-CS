				 Jaguar sale gains speed
 SIMI KAMBOJ																								Mumbai, Nov. 19: The Tatas, the Mahindras and private equity firm One Equity  the three bidders for Jaguar and Land Rover  will kick off talks with the union leaders of the two car makers tomorrow.																								The two car marques are being put up for sale by Ford Motors, which is in the midst of a restructuring drive after continuously losing market share since 1995.																								Tony Woodley, general secretary of Unite, Britains most powerful trade union, and Dave Osborne, its national officer, will participate in the talks with representatives from the three bidders in what is being termed as a very important meeting. 																								Unite, which represents workers from both companies, has demanded that Ford retain a substantial chunk in the two companies and remain involved in the decision-making process. 																								Weve stated very clearly that if Ford decides to sell these companies, the manufacturing plants should remain in the UK. Ford should retain a significant equity stake in both companies and maintain all the three plants, said Unite spokesperson Andrew Dodgson. 																								The two companies employ around 16,000 people in factories in Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Halewood on Merseyside, with the last producing both Land Rover and Jaguar models. We wont be happy if only a private equity player bids for the companies, he added. 																								One Equitys bid is being led by former Ford chief executive Jacques Nasser.																								Tata Motors and One Equity were the top contenders for the two marques ever since Ford announced that they were up for sale. Recently, Mahindra and Mahindra, which has the support of Apollo, the US buyout firm, re-entered the fray.																								Citing the confidentiality agreement signed with Ford, Dodgson refused to divulge details about the talks. 																								However, he said his union wanted Ford to secure the component supply in the UK itself after the acquisition.																								We want the company to sign 10-year service contract for the supply of components. The company will also have to maintain the two engine plants at Dagenham and Bridgend and the transmission plant at Halewood, he added.																								The union has sought the intervention of the British government to deal with these two key issues. Mahindra and Mahindra officials refused to comment. 																								However, Hemant Luthra, president (systems and technologies sector) of Mahindra and Mahindra, said it made sense for his company to bid for Land Rover. 																								Land Rover has technology which makes bidding for it a lot of sense. In any case, we dont usually participate in auctions and are always looking out for acquisitions, said Luthra. 																								Tata Motors spokesman said the companys policy was not to comment on mergers and acquisitions.																								Industry watchers, however, feel Tata Motors stands a better chance in the bidding process given the way it handled the crucial issue of workers pension funding during the Corus deal.

				 Tata Steel gears up for rights issue
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Big plans																								Calcutta, Oct. 7: Tata Steel has set November 5 as the record date for its proposed Rs 9,135-crore rights issue.																								The company will offer one equity share for every five held for Rs 300 and nine cumulative convertible preference shares for every 10 shares held at a face value of Rs 100.																								The preference shares will be converted to equity shares on September 1, 2009. After the compulsory and automatic conversion, 6 preference shares of the face value of Rs 100 will automatically become one equity share of Rs 600. 																								The preference shares will be offered to the shareholders on an ex-right basis.																								After the preference shares are converted, Tata Steels share capital will rise to 82.21 crore shares of Rs 10 each from 60.89 crore shares. Industry observers said both the rights and preference issues have been attractively priced.																								The Tata Steel scrip has risen 20.27 per cent to Rs 832.90 from Rs 692.55 in the last one month. It touched a high for the year, at Rs 876, on Thursday.																								The company will raise Rs 3,654 crore through the rights issue and another Rs 5,481 crore through the preference offering. The company had earlier considered raising Rs 4,350 crore through the preference share issue. In a board meeting on July 30, it decided to increase the issue size to around Rs 6,000 crore.																								There was also a possibility that the conversion price could be increased from Rs 500-600.																								Tata Steel decided against increasing the conversion price. It instead decided to issue the preference shares more liberally than earlier. 																								However, the ratio at which the preference shares are being offered  nine for every 10 shares held  has been disclosed only now.																								The proceeds of the rights issue will be used to fund the companys $13-billion acquisition of Anglo Dutch steel maker Corus.																								The increased contribution from the preference share issue also helped Tata Steel raise the equity contribution in the Corus deal. Tata Steel decided to increase the contribution from Tata Steel/Tata Steel Asia Holdings Pte Ltd to $7.4 billion from $6.7 billion.

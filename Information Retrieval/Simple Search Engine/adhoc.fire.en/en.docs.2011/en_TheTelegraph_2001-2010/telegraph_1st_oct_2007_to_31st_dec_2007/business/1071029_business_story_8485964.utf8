				 Mobile money
 Cash transfer is now easy, fast and cheap. Just use your cellphone, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay																								Sending money has never been so cheap and convenient. Thanks to mobile telecommunication, money remittance is just few clicks away. And its cheaper than fund transfers through cheques, bank drafts or post office money orders (see chart). 																								ICICI Bank launched this facility in an arrangement with Reliance Communication (R-Com) in the last week of September. An ICICI Bank customer, who also subscribes to R-Coms CDMA or GSM mobile services, can now send and receive money from another ICICI Bank customer in a different city through the handset.																								By the end of this year, Visa credit and debit cardholders will also be able to receive and send money through their cellphones. 																								Visa International has joined hands with mChek, Corporation Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank to extend its existing card-to-card Visa Money Transfer service to the mobile telecom platform. 																								Money from abroad																								If you expect to receive money from someone abroad, check out with your neighbourhood Bharti Airtel outlet. The service provider has joined hands with Western Union for cross-border money transfer. 																								Bharti Airtel has also tied up with the State Bank of India for domestic remittance of money through mobile phones. 																								Though the Reserve Bank had given an in-principle approval to the Bharti Airtel-SBI proposal to launch the service on a non-profit basis, telecom service providers are still not clear whether the revenue from this service will be taken into consideration while calculating the licence fee to the department of telecom.																								Cost aspect 																								But going by the R-Com-ICICI Bank offer, the charges for transfering money through a mobile will still be less compared with cheques, bank drafts, electronic fund transfer and post office money order. 																								The service, being offered free of cost till December this year, will cost Rs 10 (telecom charge) from January. Customers will be able to transfer up to Rs 5,000 in a single day from their account to another account in the bank through their mobile phones. 																								How does it work																								After you send the message, money will be debited from your account and the amount credited to the recipients account in a day or two. The recipient will also be informed about the money receipt through an SMS. The amount of Rs 10 will be deducted from your bank account as the transaction fee.																								Whats the catch																								The limitation of this money transfer service is that both the sender and the recipient must have accounts with ICICI Bank and one cannot send more than Rs 5,000 in a single day. These limitations will be mitigated to some extent in the Visa-mCheck offer. 																								Sanjay Swamy of mChek said, Visa is already providing a card-to-card money transfer facility in association with a number of banks. Under the existing system, customers of a bank (offering the Visa Money Transfer service) holding a Visa debit or credit card can send money to another Visa cardholder with some other bank using the ATM or internet banking platform of their own bank. The new service will be an extension of the existing facility wherein Visa card holders can send money from their handsets. 																								Who benefits																								To start with, Corporation Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank customers (who hold Visa credit or debit cards) only will be able to send and receive money through their mobiles. But Visa cardholders of other banks will only be able to receive money and cant send it. We are talking to other banks as well, Swamy said.																								Under this offer, individual banks will determine how much money one can send in a single day. It is, however, unlikely that it will differ much from the limit under the existing system. 																								Corporation Bank allows its customers to send up to Rs 25,000 in a single day. The bank, however, charges Rs 25 for this facility. 																								Under the Visa service, the sender will have to key in the 16-digit credit or debit card number of the recipient. 																								If the recipients have a debit card, the money will be directly credited to their bank account. But if it is a credit card, the recipients will have to pay the usual cash withdrawal charge if they want to take out the money.

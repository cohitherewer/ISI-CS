				 LIC beefs up investment war chest
 ANIRUDH LASKARMumbai, Nov. 25: The Life Insurance Corporation, the countrys largest insurer, plans to invest Rs 1,15,000 crore this fiscal  35 per cent more than the Rs 85,000 crore it invested in the previous year.																								A senior LIC official told The Telegraph that the corporation, which is the biggest state-owned institution funnelling money into the capital markets, had invested about Rs 60,000 crore till September 30 and was scouting for opportunities to deploy the rest.																								The corporation will invest at least 50 per cent of the amount in government securities, while about Rs 11,500 crore, or 8-10 per cent of the kitty, will be parked in equities.																								These investments do not include unit-linked policies (Ulips). Last year, the LIC had invested Rs 16,000 crore of its Ulip funds in the capital market.																								The life insurance firm has also been putting its money into mutual funds. We have invested about Rs 4,000 crore in short-term liquid funds till September 30. Its difficult to say how much we will invest in the mutual funds this year. Earlier, we were allowed to invest in the call money market, but the regulator has now barred us from doing so, LIC managing director D.K. Mehrotra said.																								Driven by Ulips, the LICs investment in the equity markets is set to double this fiscal. The corporation invested about Rs 24,000 crore in the stock markets in 2006-07, which is 62 per cent higher than the Rs 14,800 crore in the previous year. 																								With the sensex yielding returns above 45 per cent year-on-year, the LICs purchases of equities have surged to almost Rs 20,000 crore, which includes an exposure of around Rs 14,000 crore through Ulips.																								The Insurance Act (1938) allows a maximum investment of 50 per cent in government approved securities, a total of 35 per cent on immovable property and bank deposits, and a maximum of 15 per cent in what are termed other-than-approved instruments  a category that includes mutual funds. 																								The LICs life fund stands at more than Rs 4,63,147 crore and its assets are worth Rs 5,52,447 crore. 																								We have our own equity research cell which guides us on our investments. Although we are bullish on the equity market, banking, telecommunications, and infrastructure are the sectors that are showing the highest return potential at present, Mehrotra added. 																								The Life Insurance Council estimated that total investment by the life insurance sector in the stock market was at Rs 1,50,000 crore on March 31.

				 Suzuki to double scooter capacity
 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA				 	 WHEELS OF FORTUNE																								Calcutta, Nov. 3: Suzuki Motorcycle India Pvt Ltd is betting big on scooters. It is looking to double its market share in the segment to 20 per cent by the middle of next year.																								The two-wheeler maker also plans to double the manufacturing capacity of scooters to 10,000 units by April next year.																								We have received a good response for the Suzuki Access with more than 20,000 bookings in the last one month. The automatic scooter market in India grew 10 per cent last fiscal, while the motorbike market fell by 8 per cent, said Atul Gupta, vice-president (sales and marketing) of Suzuki Motorcycle India Pvt Ltd.																								The scooter market in India is estimated at 60,000 units, with automatic scooters comprising the bulk at 50,000.																								Lack of financing in rural areas has affected motorbike sales.																								Suzuki also plans to double the dealership in Bengal from six to 12 and nationally to 310 by next year.																								The two-wheeler market in the state has been growing between 7 and 8 per cent for the last three years compared with the national average of 10-11 per cent. Every month, 15,000 motorbikes and 4,000 scooters are sold in Bengal.																								Suzukis overall manufacturing capacity is also expected to increase from 1.7 lakh to 2.4 lakh units by the next fiscal. 																								The company has invested Rs 350 crore in India to set up its manufacturing facility in Gurgaon. 																								The plant has been built over 6.5 acres out of the total area of 37 acres. 																								The rest of the land will be used for future expansion.																								An additional investment of Rs 150 crore has been planned for the next two-and-a-half years to add more models to its product line.																								Suzuki has introduced models such as the Heat for the semi-urban and rural regions at Rs 35,000, while the price of the 100cc model is around Rs 32,000. This has been done to upgrade to the 125cc models. 																								All subsequent models will be 125cc and above.																								Overall, the company plans to garner 4 per cent of the two-wheeler market by 2010 by selling 3.5 lakh units.

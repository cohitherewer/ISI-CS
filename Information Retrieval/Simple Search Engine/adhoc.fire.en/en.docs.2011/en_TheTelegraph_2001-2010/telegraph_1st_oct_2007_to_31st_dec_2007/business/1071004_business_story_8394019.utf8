				 Spectrum scarcity to be over soon 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Telecom minister A. Raja in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Oct. 3: The government will provide more spectrum to telecom companies by November, telecom minister A. Raja said today. 																								According to officials, the rule of allocating spectrum on a first come, first served basis will also be removed. 																								Officials present at the meeting between the minister and mobile operators said companies wanting to expand operations to new circles could be asked to separately bid for spectrum through the auction route, turning airwaves into a priced commodity.																								The current policy offers 2G spectrum to companies on a first come, first served basis. When a licence is allocated for a particular circle, it comes bundled with 2G spectrum. 																								A final decision on the revised telecom licensing norms was not taken today. However, there will be more meetings this week. 																								The government wants a definite set of guidelines by October 10 to lend clarity to future spectrum allocation norms, said officials. On the availability of spectrum, Raja said, The spectrum issue with the ministry of defence will be resolved by November end.																								The minister had been demanding release of 45Mhz of spectrum from the defence. 																								Industry representatives from established telecom companies also made a case for treating their pending applications for mobile licences as top priority.																								COAI, which represents GSM operators, told the minister that any move to auction additional spectrum for existing second-generation mobile services was against the terms of the unified access licence. 																								The licence stipulated that mobile companies will get spectrum as and when they reached a specific subscriber base, said a COAI representative. 																								The apex body also quoted a number of official communications from the DoT whereby additional spectrum had been promised to operators on an ongoing basis. 																								According to Raja, the government has received 300 applications from nearly 30 companies to enter into the fast growing telecom sector. A committee has been formed to scrutinise details of these applicants before a decision is taken to award the unified access service licences.

The health alert on the economy was sounded by a senior executive of one of India Incs leading lights, Tata Motors. 																								Rajiv Dube, president of Tata Motors, blamed the situation on the government.																								This has happened because of a macroeconomic intervention.

Both auto and realty have a web of links with other sectors; if they falter, the repercussions permeate the rest of the economy.																								The government and the Reserve Bank of India have taken many steps to check demand and stop overheating of the economy.																								Dube said: For most part of the (auto) industry it has been a tough year. When the SIAM data (for September) is officially released youll notice that the growth is down to single digits for the first time.

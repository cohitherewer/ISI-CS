				 Cosmetic changes in phone licence rules
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Telecom minister A. Raja (left) with Vodafone Essar managing director Asim Ghosh (right) and IIT Kharagpur director Damodar Acharya in New Delhi on Tuesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Oct. 16: The government today indicated at minor changes in the telecom licensing policy. The changes will be based on the recommendations of the telecom regulator issued in August.																								Communications minister A. Raja said, Having received so many applications, we cannot change the policy. Existing criteria will be applied in the background of Trai recommendations to allocate spectrum to new and existing players. The minister was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a Ficci conference here today. 																								At the same event, telecom secretary Dinesh Mathur said the government was open to foreign players bidding for 3G spectrum.																								He said the government could allot 3G spectrum via the allotment route instead of auctions. The department of telecom (DoT) will follow a criterion to allocate such spectrum, though Mathur refused to give the details of the norms.																								For 2G spectrum, if the DoT follows the existing policy, the allocation of spectrum for new applicants will be on a first come, first served basis. 																								This means multinationals such as AT amp;T and realty firms such as DLF and Unitech are unlikely to get spectrum as they are well behind in the queue. 																								It also implies that priority will be given to the pending applications of existing players such as Vodafone, Idea, Spice and Aircel. Aircel holds licences for 14 circles, Idea for one and Vodafone, six. However, they are unable to launch services in the absence of spectrum. 																								Mathur said the DoT was carefully considering the proposal of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to link additional spectrum with the subscriber base of an operator.																								GSM operators have opposed the recommendation, arguing the proposal is flawed. 																								Though Mathur ruled out differences within the DoT on the Trai proposals, some officials did not believe that was the case. 																								Differences are believed to have emerged in the DoT over Trais proposal to change the existing subscriber-linked criterion for allocating additional spectrum, with communication minister backing it while the Telecom Commission opposing it, the officials said.																								The Telecom Commission, which is studying the recommendations, is yet to submit its report on the subscriber-linked criterion. 																								Raja said he would meet national security advisor M.K. Narayanan tomorrow seeking early vacation of spectrum from defence authorities.

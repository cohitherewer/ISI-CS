				 Daimler tribute to Benz
				 	 DaimlerChrysler chairman Dieter Zetsche in Berlin on Thursday. (AFP)																								Berlin, Oct. 4 (Reuters): German car maker DaimlerChrysler will be renamed Daimler AG after selling a majority stake in its struggling US arm Chrysler to Cerberus.																								The renamed company has also decided to call its passenger car business Mercedes-Benz Cars, chief executive Dieter Zetsche told shareholders today.																								The car maker sought the approval of the shareholders for the name change.																								The shareholders welcomed the move to unwind the troubled $36-billion merger and abolish the old name. However, many German investors and fans of the Mercedes-Benz marque wanted the company to honour Carl Friedrich Benz, at least in the name.																								Benzs company merged with that of Gottlieb Daimler in 1926 but his name fell off the corporate masthead when the now abandoned trans-Atlantic merger went through seven years ago.																								Zetsche insisted Daimler had to be the name of the group, but said there was still plenty of room to honour Benz.																								The proud name of Benz will not only remain prominent, it will have significantly higher visibility, he said.																								That means its premium division Mercedes Car Group will be known as Mercedes-Benz Cars, while the van unit will be called Mercedes-Benz Vans and the DaimlerChrysler Bank will be renamed Mercedes-Benz Bank.																								The groups truck business will be called Daimler Trucks, the bus brands will operate under the name Daimler Buses and financial services unit will be renamed Daimler Financial Services.																								The group name Daimler clearly indicates that we are writing a new chapter of our history, while at the same time continuing our tradition as the inventor of the automobile, Zetsche said.																								This rich heritage will remain an essential part of our identity  of our DNA, so to speak, he added.																								Sales of Mercedes cars rose 7.4 per cent in September to 124,600 vehicles.

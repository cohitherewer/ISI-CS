				 Tea units report fall in export, production

 A STAFF REPORTER 
				 	 CUP OF CHEER
																								Calcutta, Dec. 30: Tea production is estimated to have declined to 940 million kg in 2007 from 957 million kg in 2006, the Indian Tea Association (ITA) said.
																								In its status paper, the ITA said exports were also estimated to have gone down by 39 million kg to 180 million kg this year, while imports have dipped to 15 million kg in 2007 from 24 million kg in 2006.
																								However, domestic consumption has grown to 810 million kg compared with 785 million kg in 2006.
																								Regarding the outlook for 2008, the status paper said it appeared to be bright and prices would be largely governed by the progress of the crop and the export demand from the beginning of the season.
																								There will also be insignificant carry forward of stocks compared to the previous years, the paper said. This is likely to help in the realisation of higher prices.
																								The report added that the industry needed to focus on value-added quality tea, which would be able to generate strong demand abroad and compete with other beverage categories in the domestic market.
																								ORG India is preparing a report on domestic consumption patterns of loose and packaged tea, preferred attributes and factors influencing consumption in various Indian states. 
																								The report said in 2006, exports surged because of drought-like conditions in Kenya, which imported from India and re-exported to countries such as Egypt. 
																								In 2007, the industry was hit by 15 per cent rupee appreciation. Kenya also had a bumper crop. Besides there were also the loss of the Iraq market and a shift in drinking preferences to the orthodox variety from CTCs.
																								The Union government took note of this problem and in July, enhanced rates under the duty entitlement passbook scheme to 4 per cent from 1 per cent. It also reduced the interest rate on pre- and post-shipment credit by 2 per cent. 
																								Incentives to orthodox production have led to a higher output of 5 million kg, which is entirely from north India. If growth is strong next year, India will be able to increase its exports to orthodox markets such as Russia, Iran and the UAE. Orthodox teas fetched better prices in 2007 compared with the year-ago period.

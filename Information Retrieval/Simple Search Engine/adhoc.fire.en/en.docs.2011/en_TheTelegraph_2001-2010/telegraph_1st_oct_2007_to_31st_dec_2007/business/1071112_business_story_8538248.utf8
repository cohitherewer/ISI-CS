				 Apex court scraps extra levy on laptops
																								New Delhi, Nov. 11 (PTI): In a judgement that could cheer both IT companies and end-users, the Supreme Court has held that the government cannot levy an additional 7 per cent customs duty on notebooks, also called laptops, as in the case of desktop computers since the two are basically different.																								Dismissing a petition filed by the commissioner of customs, a bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha said the government could not ask IT companies to pay the additional customs duty on laptops, unlike desktops, as the two were completely different, despite performing same or similar functions.																								We are of the opinion that a laptop or a notebook, being an integrated item, cannot be a set of a CPU with monitor, mouse and key board, the court said.																								A desktop is a combination of items, which when put together make a computer, the court observed. 																								It added that a notebook, on the other hand, comes in an integrated and inseparable form and thus cannot be said to be a set of all these parts. Upholding the customs, excise and services tax appellate tribunals judgement, the court said the interpretation by the tribunal was in consonance with Computers (Additional Duty) Rules, 2004. 																								The tribunal had passed the order on an appeal filed by Bangalore-based Acer India Pvt Ltd challenging levy of an additional 7 per cent duty on imported laptops.																								According to the customs department, there was not much of a difference between a laptop and a desktop for the purposes of classification.																								Opposing the departments plea, Acer had said that laptops were not desktop computers and were known differently in the market.

 Q amp;A				 Address change
																																																																																													 I want to open a demat account and get a PAN for the same. I had already applied for a PAN at my present address. But I shall shift to a new address soon. Is there any way I can change my address on the PAN that will show my old address? 																																																																													Sneha Mitra, Calcutta
																																																																																													After you get the PAN that you had applied for, you can request for a change in address in the same. For this you will have to fill up a request form mentioning your 10-digit permanent account number in the initial card. You can get the request form from UTI Technology Services Ltd or from their website: www.utitsl.co.in. You will be issued a new card with the rectification.																																					Identity problem																																																																																															 I hold some shares of Steel Authority of India Ltd jointly with my son. The shares were bought in 1993. We later on opened a demat account with the State Bank of India and sent the shares for dematerialisation. But MCS Ltd, the registrar of shares for SAIL, returned those shares citing mismatch in signature of my son. What should we do?																																																																													M.K. Ghosh, Durgapur
																																																																																													Both of you sign on a new transfer deed, affix right amount of court fee stamp and send the transfer deed along with the share certificate to the registrar. It would be better if you get your signatures attested by the branch manager of the bank where you have an account.																																					Different rates																																																																																															 I have recently sold the first floor of my dwelling. The registrar assigned a different price and imposed the registration and stamp duty accordingly. The registrar-imposed price is quite high than the price I got and declared in the sale deed. Which of these two prices can I use to assess the capital gains?																																																																													S. Ghosh, Calcutta
																																																																																													 When the registrar changes the sale price from that mentioned by the seller of the property, the registration fees and stamp duty are determined according to the changed price. The changed price is also noted down on the deed of conveyance. You can use this price to assess your capital gains as you have paid registration fees and stamp duty according to the sale price of the property as recorded by the registrar.

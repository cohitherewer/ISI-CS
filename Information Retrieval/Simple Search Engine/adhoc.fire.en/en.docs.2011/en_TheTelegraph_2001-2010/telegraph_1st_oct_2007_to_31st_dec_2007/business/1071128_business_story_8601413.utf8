				 Real-time vigil on volatility
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Reddy: Strict																								Mumbai, Nov. 27: The raging sub-prime crisis in the US may not directly have an impact on India, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is not taking any chances.																								The central bank has established a mechanism to monitor volatility in the global financial markets on a real-time basis.																								Reserve Bank governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy today said the central bank would take appropriate action to deal with any situation that might arise.																								Reddys statement is an indication of the importance that the central bank has been assigning to global developments over the past few months. 																								The apex bank more or less has a handle on the domestic sources of worry: inflation has been capped at just over 3 per cent and credit growth in the system has moderated.																								In its Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2006-07, the RBI said it was monitoring various segments of the global financial markets on a real time basis. Moreover, its financial markets committee (FMC), headed by a deputy governor, meets at least once a day to review market developments.																								If the markets witness great volatility, special FMC meetings are convened where an expanded team acts as a crisis management group and maintains contacts with other regulators and exchanges.																								The RBI is concerned about the impact that an aggravation of the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US can have on the Indian markets.																								The central bank said foreign institutional investors (FIIs), which have invested heavily in the countrys equity market, showed a tendency to hurriedly withdraw. This leads to a systemic sudden stop  which is defined as a large, unexpected and widespread collapse of capital flows into a country that bears no relation to its underlying economic fundamentals.																								Such a hasty withdrawal of money could put pressure on equity markets in India and its exchange rate. 																								Moreover, the tightening of liquidity conditions in the international capital markets may also impact corporate houses by raising the cost of overseas borrowings. 																								The withdrawal by FIIs on a large scale may also have implications on domestic liquidity conditions and interest rates.																								Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a banking conference here, Reddy said while the current global liquidity crunch was unprecedented, the diagnosis was becoming difficult.																								He felt the uncertainty might not be resolved anytime soon. Pointing out that every country had to respond to capital flows with its own measures, he said India could not be immune to global developments.																								It looks as though the uncertainties may be resolved a little later than what we originally thought, he added.

 Q amp;A				 Redemption time
																																																																																													 I invested Rs 30,000 in HDFC Tax Saver scheme under the growth option in November 2006. I want to get a return of 20 per cent to 25 per cent. When should I redeem those units?																																																																													Suchitra Mukherjee, Khidderpore
																																																																																													Equity-linked tax saving schemes of mutual funds come with a lock-in period of three years, during which an investor cannot redeem the units. So you will have to wait till November 2009 to redeem those units. Tax planning schemes as a category gave a return of 27 per cent over the three years ended November 1. HDFC Tax Saver during the same time gave a return of over 58 per cent. However, past performance doesnt assure a similar return in future. 																																					Sons gift																																																																																															 My son has gifted some money to his mother who doesnt have any other income. She wants to invest the money in post office monthly income scheme or bank fixed deposits. If my wife opens a joint account with me as the second account holder, who will have to bear the tax liability?																																																																													K. Ghosh, Birbhum
																																																																																													The tax liability will be on your wife. For women the basic annual income limit to calculate tax liability is Rs 1,35,000. If her interest income from the deposit is more than Rs 1.35 lakh per annum, then she will have to pay tax.																																					Nominee signature																																																																																															 Is the signature of nominee mandatory in the nomination form of bank accounts? A bank asked me to present the nominee for signature in their presence. 																																																																													Kamal Baksi, West Midnapur
																																																																																													No, a nominee is not needed to sign the nomination form. The prescribed nomination form DA-1 (in respect of bank deposits) under section 45 ZA of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 doesnt mention nominees signature. 																																					Tax-free status																																																																																															 The agent says if I sell my investments in the Future Plus and Market Plus schemes of LIC after the initial lock-in period of three years, the proceeds will be tax-free. Is this true? 																																																																													Sunil Kumar Das, Calcutta
																																																																																													The agent is right. The sale proceeds are tax-free after the initial lock-in period of three years. This is the same as in case of ELSS of mutual funds.

				 TCG firm ready for flotation 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 LIFELINE																								Mumbai, Oct. 2: Purnendu Chatterjee, who has spawned many ventures in India, is taking TCG Lifesciences Ltd public. TCG Lifesciences is the first company from The Chatterjee Group to come out with an initial public offering (IPO).																								On Monday, the company filed its draft red-herring prospectus with the Securities amp; Exchange Board of India. It proposes to issue 95 lakh shares at a price to be decided through a 100 per cent book-building process. 																								The float comprises a fresh issue of 90 lakh shares, while up to 5 lakh shares will be reserved for employees. The net issue will constitute 13.65 per cent of the fully diluted post issue paid-up capital of the company.																								TCG Lifesciences is also considering a pre-IPO placement of up to 15 lakh shares with some investors. The placement is likely to be completed before the filing of the red-herring prospectus with the Registrar of Companies. 																								In that case, the issue size will be reduced to the extent of the placement. However, a minimum of 10 per cent of the post-issue capital will be offered to the public.																								The company is promoted by Purnendu Chatterjee and TCG Lifesciences Mauritius Ltd and has operations in India, the UK and the US. 																								TCG Lifesciences offers solutions in discovery research, clinical development and other areas to the global life sciences industry. 																								A part of the proceeds from the IPO will be used to expand the activities of TCG Lifesciences, particularly in Pune and Calcutta. 																								In its filing with the market regulator, the company said it was setting up laboratories at Calcutta and Pune covering approximately 160,000 sq ft for research in chemistry and biology.																								The construction of the facilities is expected to start in January and become operational by March 2009.																								The company will lease two plots of 2.5 acres and 3.43 acres within the special economic zone at the International Biotech Park in Pune for approximately 90 years. It has also bought on lease a 2-acre plot at Calcuttas Salt Lake Electronics complex from the West Bengal Electronics Industries Development Corporation for 90 years. This can be renewed for two more terms of 90 years each. 																								Part of the proceeds will also be used to prepay an outstanding debt of up to Rs 24 crore.

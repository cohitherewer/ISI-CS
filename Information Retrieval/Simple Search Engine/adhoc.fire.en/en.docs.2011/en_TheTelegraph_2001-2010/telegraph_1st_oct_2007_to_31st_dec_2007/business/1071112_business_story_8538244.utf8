				 Hyundai to launch SUV
 GARIMA SINGH NEOGY				 	 New wheels																								New Delhi, Nov. 11: Hyundai Motors India plans to launch its mid-size sports utility vehicle (SUV), the Santa Fe, by the middle of next year. 																								Santa Fe is a premium SUV. We plan to launch it in five to six months, an official said.																								The seven-seater car, which will be imported from Korea as a completely built unit, is made on the same platform as the Sonata. It is likely to sport a 3-litre common-rail- turbo-diesel engine.																								The car is available abroad in three versions  the Santa Fe GLS, the Santa Fe SE and the Santa Fe Ltd. Sources said the car would be costlier than the Tucson, which comes at Rs 15 lakh. The price should be significantly higher than the Tucson, a source said. There are, however, some reports that say the introductory base model will be priced below Rs 10 lakh.																								Company officials said Santa Fe might come at Rs 4-5 lakh more than the Tucson.																								Hyundai has already launched the next-generation Santa Fe in the US and Europe.																								When asked if the company plans to replace the Tucson with the Santa Fe, the official said, The Tucson is not selling well. However, we are consciously introducing another SUV to give more choice to our customers.																								The company plans to bet on the rising sales of premium SUVs in India, and is therefore launching the Santa Fe, which is a best seller in North America. Sales of SUVs are expected to increase 25-30 per cent this fiscal to 7,000 units from 4,800 units in the previous year.

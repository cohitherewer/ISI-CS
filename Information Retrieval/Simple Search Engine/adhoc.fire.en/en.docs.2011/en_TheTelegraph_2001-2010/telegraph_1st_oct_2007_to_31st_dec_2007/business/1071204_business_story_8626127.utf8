				 SAIL raises bid for Malvika
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Roongta: Pushing ahead																								New Delhi, Dec. 3: Steel Authority of India Ltd has matched the Jayprakash groups offer price of Rs 207 crore for Malvika Steel.																								Chairman S.K. Roongta told The Telegraph that SAIL had matched the bid of the Jayprakash group but the matter was now before the appellate tribunal, which would decide the issue.																								The debt recovery tribunal (DRT) had invited bids from interested parties for Malvika Steel, a company floated by the Rai family. 																								SAIL was initially outbid by Jayprakash and in June this year, the DRT was in favour of awarding the plant to the latter.																								But the state-run steel behemoth is back in the fight with a matching offer and a promise to invest Rs 300 crore in Malvika Steel. 																								The DRT is auctioning the entire plant, located on 740 acres at Jagdishpur in Amethi  which is Rahul Gandhis constituency in Uttar Pradesh  to recover outstanding loans. 																								The Rs 300-crore steel project was left unfinished in 1998, within 10 months of getting off the ground. Malvika Steel owes nearly Rs 1,366 crore to IFCI Ltd alone.																								Indo Gulfs fertiliser plant and Bhels insulator manufacturing division are adjacent to the steel plant. Some 1,000 workers were laid off when the plant was closed. 																								Their hopes for new jobs are tied to Malvika Steels revival.																								SAIL is likely to use the plant for processing activities, using steel from its plants in eastern India.																								The Jagdishpur plant could supply to markets in Uttar Pradesh and even Nepal. It is part of SAILs marketing strategy to have processing units near markets, to add value to its products. 																								Sources said SAIL was also planning to take over the ailing Steel Complex Ltd in Kozhikode. It is owned by the Kerala government. 																								SAIL has conducted two rounds of discussions with the company. 																								Sources said if the deal materialised, SAIL would invest another Rs 300 crore in Kerala.

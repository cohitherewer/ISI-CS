				 Spectrum benchmark set 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Raja: New rules																								New Delhi, Nov. 5: The recommendations of the Technical Engineering Centre (TEC) on spectrum allocation will be the basis for all future discussions between the government and GSM players.																								The TEC report has a scientific approach, said Andimuthu Raja, minister for communications and information technology.																								According to the minister, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had also submitted its views on increasing subscriber base for the allocation of additional spectrum, but the telecom commission was not satisfied with the Trai report and referred the matter to the TEC.																								Raja said he was open to discussions with the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI)  representing GSM mobile service providers  on spectrum allocation.																								I have an open mind and am ready to hear them, said Raja. Telecom ministry officials said they were willing to discuss the subscriber base norms with the COAI and other affected parties and were open to changes.																								However, they felt that the TEC study is based on the number of current subscribers and, therefore, how many subscribers can be accommodated within the existing spectrum has to be the base for any discussion.																								In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Raja had, however, taken a tough stance and said the COAI was misleading the country by opposing the scientific approach that his ministry had followed on frequency (spectrum) allocation. 																								The minister described his ministrys efforts as honest endeavours that would help increase teledensity.																								The TEC report suggested that subscriber base should be increased 4 to 15 times, depending on the telecom circle, before a GSM service provider becomes eligible to get the next tranche of spectrum.																								TECs report was prepared after Trai came out with a similar recommendation prescribing an increase in the subscriber base by 4 to 8 times per circle for additional spectrum.

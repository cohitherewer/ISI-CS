				 Electrolux in premium league
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Electrolux CEO Anirudh Dhoot in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, Oct. 22: Electrolux, the home appliances division of Videocon Industries, is looking at strengthening its presence in the premium segment.																								The company plans to manufacture high-end refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves, and air conditioners at its new plant in Uttarakhand. The facility at Uttarakhand, set up at an investment of Rs 200 crore, will be operational by January next year.																								Electrolux has two manufacturing units at Shahjanpur in Rajasthan and at Varora near Nagpur. The units manufacture small and medium-sized refrigerators. The high-end models are imported from China and Thailand. 																								In the past, we were present in the premium segment. But our maximum sales came from low and mid-segment products. Now our focus is to establish a stronger presence in the premium category as well, said Anirudh Dhoot, CEO of Electrolux.																								Dhoot said the Uttarakhand unit would also enable the company to cater to the overseas market. Once production starts at the new plant, we intend to export to Saarc nations and West Asia, besides serving the domestic market, Dhoot said.																								The company will also introduce front-loading washing machines and a separate range of driers for its washer category. We are working on the washer category and will launch new products by January-end next year, said Madhav Nene, general manager (marketing) of Electrolux.																								The company today launched a range of refrigerators priced between Rs 29,000 and Rs 2.4 lakh. Electrolux is betting big on the festival season. This year we expect the total revenue to increase to Rs 600 crore from Rs 500 crore last year, Nene said. The company is eyeing a 10 per cent increase in sales at Rs 150 crore.

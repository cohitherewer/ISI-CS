				 CII study reveals growth gaps
 OUR BUREAUNew Delhi, Nov. 11: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) today said 17 sectors have recorded negative growth in the first half of the current fiscal. This stands in sharp contrast to the growth numbers released by the government.																								It is a matter of concern that more than 50 per cent of the manufacturing sector has recorded either moderate or negative growth, said CII industry council chairman Satish Kaura while releasing the Ascon survey conducted by the chamber.																								While the government claimed that only one of the 17 industry groups recorded negative growth between April-August 2007, the Ascon survey said 17 out of 91 sectors showed negative performance during the first half of the year (April-September).																								The survey attributed the low growth to rising interest rates, reduced credit availability and the strong rupee.																								The free trade agreements signed by the government in the last two years have also adversely affected the performance of the manufacturing sector, the survey said, adding that the automobile industry, including motorcycles and three-wheelers, are among the sectors in the negative sales growth category.																								The CII-Ascon survey further revealed that cement, energy meter, ball and roller bearing, polymer, utility vehicles, refrigerators, rubber footwear, bus and truck tyres have shown moderate growth, while fertiliser, machine tools, capacitors, motorcycles, edible oil are in the negative zone. 																								The official index of industrial production, however, had said that only metal products and parts (except machinery and equipment) showed negative growth during April-August 2007.																								According to the CII Ascon survey, out of the 91 sectors, 15 reported excellent growth rates of more than 20 per cent, 22 sectors recorded high growth rates of 10-20 per cent, 37 sectors posted moderate growth rates of less than 10 per cent and 17 sectors reported negative growth.																								The percentage of sectors in excellent and high-growth categories declined, while that for the moderate and negative categories increased between April to June 2007.																								Scooters, mopeds, electric fans, sponge iron, circuit breakers and transformers were in the excellent growth category, while those in the high-growth segment included asbestos, cement pig iron, power cables, industrial valves, textile machinery, transmission line towers, air conditioners and microwave ovens.																								On exports, the survey said five sectors showed excellent growth, five sectors revealed high growth, eight sectors registered moderate growth and five sectors registered a decline.																								Exports of cement, ceramics, mopeds and rubber goods fell during the first six months of the current fiscal.																								Machine tools, air-conditioners and motorcycles registered excellent growth performance, while those in the high-growth category included vehicles, three-wheelers, industrial valves and cold rolled steel, the survey said.

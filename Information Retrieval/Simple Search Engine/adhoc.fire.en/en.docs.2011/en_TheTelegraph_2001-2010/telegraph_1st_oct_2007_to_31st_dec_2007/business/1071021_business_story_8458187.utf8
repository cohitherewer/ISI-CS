				 Vimal re-enters with a new look 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dress Circle																								Mumbai, Oct. 20: Vimal  the Reliance Industries textile brand  is being relaunched with a new look, new logo and new offerings.																								Only Vimal  the brand that was named after patriarch Dhirubhais nephew  was a highly visible brand in the eighties and marketed on television and radio with a lilting jingle.																								The textile business contributes less than 1 per cent of its topline these days. 																								Still, Reliance Industries is looking to recapture the magic of that brand that easily connected with the people.																								The Vimal brand only covered fabrics at one stage. 																								Reliance now wants to bring a range of contemporary products under the Vimal brand. 																								As part of this plan, Vimal will launch ready-to-wear apparel for men. 																								Reliance also plans to open exclusive Vimal stores. Observers do not rule out the possibility of the brand being available through the Reliance Retail outlets at a later stage.																								According to Reliance, the new logo will make it more appealing and more relevant to the youth. Moreover, the innovative design is in tune with Vimals core strategy of premium, innovative products that will delight consumers. 																								The overall brand colour continues to be red.																								Vimal was very popular for its wide range of fabrics. But with the emergence of ready-to-wear apparel, the sale of fabrics has declined. 																								Reliance added that despite offering ready-to-wear apparel, the fashion for everyone concept will continue to be highlighted.																								Vimal will launch a range of mens apparel, including shirts, trousers, suits and jackets. 																								The apparel will be available under three sub-brands Vimal Red, Vimal White and Vimal Black.																								These sub-brands will be available in exclusive Vimal stores and in all the other shops stocking Vimal. 																								However, Vimal Black, will be available only at the exclusive Vimal stores, which will be opened in the coming days.																								Nita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani, has been involved with all aspects of the re-launch, store design, branding and customer experience. 																								We are all very proud of this moment. The Vimal brand will surely regain the market leadership it enjoyed, she said.

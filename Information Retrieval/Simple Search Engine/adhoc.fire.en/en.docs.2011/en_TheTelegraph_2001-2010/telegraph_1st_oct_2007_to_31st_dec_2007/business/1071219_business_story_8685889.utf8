																								Bajaj Finserv Ltd will include investments in the two insurance companies  Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Ltd and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Ltd.
																								Bajaj Auto officials declined to comment on the issue stating that the company was yet to receive the final order from the court. 
																								The court approval did not have much impact on the Baja Auto scrip and it ended marginally higher at Rs 2,795.80 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

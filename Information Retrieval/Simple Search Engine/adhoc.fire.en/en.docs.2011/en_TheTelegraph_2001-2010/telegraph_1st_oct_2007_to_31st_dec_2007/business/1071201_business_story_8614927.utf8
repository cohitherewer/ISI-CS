				 Kingfisher, Jet tickets to cost more
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 30: Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways will each increase air fares by around Rs 300 to cope with soaring fuel prices.																								Kingfisher Airlines will raise fuel surcharge by Rs 300 from Monday, a spokesperson for the airline said. 																								A Jet Airways spokesperson also said Rs 300 would be levied as a fuel surcharge on each ticket.																								Other private airlines are likely to raise the surcharge by a similar amount. SpiceJet is expected to hold a board meeting on Sunday on the surcharge. 																								However, state-owned Air India is yet to take a decision.																								As state-owned oil marketing companies are increasing aviation turbine fuel prices by over 14 per cent for December across the four metros, the cost of air travel will increase by at least Rs 150 per sector for economy class travel between the cities. 																								In Delhi, the fuel will cost 14.55 per cent more at Rs 47,444.14 per kilolitre (kl) in December compared with Rs 41,417.33 per kl in November. In Mumbai, prices will go up 14.63 per cent to Rs 49,061.13 per kl from Rs 42,796.74 per kl.																								An Indian Oil Corporation official said domestic prices have to be aligned with rising international prices of the fuel.																								Private carriers increased the surcharge by Rs 150 last month.																								A commercial airline executive said as a result of the spiralling fuel prices, the prices of aviation turbine fuel have gone up 2-3 per cent in the past three months.																								The fuel makes up nearly 40 per cent of the input cost of airlines.

				 Hindalco priority to mine buy
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bhattacharya: Looking ahead																								Calcutta, Nov. 30: Hindalco, the AV Birla group flagship, is looking for mining opportunities abroad, especially in copper.																								Managing director Debu Bhattacharya said the non-ferrous metals company would enhance its access to captive copper from 40 per cent to 60 per cent. This will give us control over cost, he said on the sidelines of the national HRD meet in Calcutta on Friday.																								Bhattacharya said the company was looking for copper mines in Latin American countries, such as Argentina, Peru and Columbia, and in Africa.																								He said Hindalco was interested in a copper mine vacated by another Indian company in Zambia. The Binanis had vacated the Zambian mine a few years back. 																								Though the company has ample bauxite reserves, Bhattacharya said Hindalco was open to acquiring more reserves. Two years back, it had shown interest in Arakun bauxite reserve in Australia. However, a Chinese company won the bid. Bhattacharya said the quality of bauxite was not good in Arakun.																								Hindalco is now working on two greenfield bauxite mining facilities through subsidiaries, Utkal Alumina and Aditya Alumina, in Orissa.

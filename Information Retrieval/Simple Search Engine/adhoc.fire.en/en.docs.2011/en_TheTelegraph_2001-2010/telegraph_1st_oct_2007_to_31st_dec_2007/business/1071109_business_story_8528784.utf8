				 Plan panel recipe for 9% growth
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT		Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)New Delhi, Nov. 8: The Planning Commission today set the stage for 9 per cent growth in the Eleventh Plan by pitching for easier foreign direct investment norms in several sectors. 																								The five-year plan cleared by the commission, at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this evening, said, Elimination of FDI limits in key sectors needs to continue to increase fund flows and stimulate transfer of technology, which is critical for improving competitiveness.																								The draft document will be placed before the cabinet for its approval, and the National Development Council will give the go ahead at a meeting on December 9.																								The government is likely to come out with a review of FDI caps in various sectors later this month. 																								The controversial areas of FDI reform are insurance, private banking, single brand retail and broadcasting.																								The plan has pushed up the average growth rate target to 9 per cent from 8 per cent in the first year of the plan (2007). 																								It expects to achieve a 10 per cent growth rate by the end of the plan period (2011-12). The average growth rate in the Tenth Plan was 7.6 per cent.																								Gross budgetary support, which is the Centres aid to the plan, has been fixed at Rs 14,21,711 crore, up from Rs 8,10,400 crore in the previous plan. The Eleventh Plan has set an ambitious target of per capita income growth of 7.6 per cent each year. This, the plan panel believes, will result in a broad-based improvement in living standards.																								To achieve higher growth and per capita incomes, the investment target is 36.7 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) compared with 30.8 per cent in the previous plan. 																								To fund the higher investment, the savings rate has been raised to 34.8 per cent of GDP compared with 30.8 per cent in the Tenth Plan. This is in addition to measures to increase FDI.																								The draft plan seeks to create some 70 million new jobs, mostly in manufacturing and services sectors. This will reduce educated unemployment to below 5 per cent.

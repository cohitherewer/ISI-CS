 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Ganguly: Ambitious																								Calcutta, Oct. 13: Refractory maker Vesuvius Group is likely to strengthen its hold in the domestic market following the global acquisition of Foseco by Cookson Group Plc. Vesuvius will now be able to offer Foseco products to its Indian customers.																								Cookson is the owner of Calcutta-based Vesuvius India. Cookson had made an open offer to Foseco India to acquire a 20 per cent stake in the company. Foseco manufactures metallurgical products.																								The offer will open on December 5 and close on December 24 this year. The offer price has been fixed at Rs 420 per share. Originally called Greaves Foseco, Foseco India was set up in 1958 as a 50:50 joint venture between Greaves, a Thapar group company, and Foundry Services Holdings (now called Foseco), a Burmah Castrol firm.																								The company offers services to SAIL, Tata Steel, Mukand, Kalyani, Musco, Ennore Foundries and Lakshmi Machine Works. The company also exports to West and East Asia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Kenya, Ghana, Bangladesh, Singapore and Taiwan.																								Vesuvius and Fosecos total turnover is expected to touch Rs 600 crore during the next fiscal.																								Vesuvius is also doubling production in its Calcutta and Vishakhaptnam facilities. Vesuvius India managing director Tanmoy Ganguly said the Vishakhaptnam facility would be completed by the end of the year while work in the Calcutta unit would start next year.																								Vesuvius recently became the first company in Bengal to have completed the National Social Security Number, provided by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation.

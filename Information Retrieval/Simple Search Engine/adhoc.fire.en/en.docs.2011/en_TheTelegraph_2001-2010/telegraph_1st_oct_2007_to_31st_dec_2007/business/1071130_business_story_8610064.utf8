				 UPS set to join hands with AFL
 OUR CORRESPONDENT			Dan Brutto in Mumbai on Thursday. (Fotocorp)Mumbai, Nov. 29: American delivery giant UPS has forged an alliance with AFL for network expansion in India.																								The strategic alliance will come into effect from January when AFLs contract with DHL expires. The UPS joint venture will plug into AFLs network for sales and operations across India, including 11 metros.																								Our alliance will expand the UPS ground locations in India, on the one hand, and AFLs export capacity on the other, said AFL chairman and managing director Cyrus Guzder. The alliance will also allow AFL to pick up international export shipments destined for more than 200 countries and territories on behalf of UPS. India and China have both registered a growth of 25 per cent last year, which brought UPS to India.																								Indias international express market is expected to grow by 20 per cent for the next four years. It is the fastest growing region in the world and exports from Asia to Europe grew by 20 per cent last year. Our timing is just right, said Dan Brutto, president of UPS International, which is now 100 years old. 																								AFL operates from over 200 locations in India, services under 6,000 pincodes and has a domestic customer base of around 17,000.																								With the alliance, UPS will see an increase in access points in India because of AFLs network, which will provide UPS with more than 200 of AFLs locations. AFL had a support services agreement with DHL for non-metro areas for six years, which is ending in December.

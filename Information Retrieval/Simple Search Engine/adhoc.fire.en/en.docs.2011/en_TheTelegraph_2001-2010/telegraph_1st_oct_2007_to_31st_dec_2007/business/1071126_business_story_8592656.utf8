				 Panel tilts towards fuel tax reduction 
 R. SURYAMURTHY				 	 RESCUE MEASURES																								New Delhi, Nov. 25: The group of ministers on fuel prices is likely to recommend cuts in taxes and will try to insulate consumers from the surge in global crude price that is poised to cross $100 a barrel.																								Government officials are pressing for a marginal increase in prices, but this will depend on the political climate. Set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the group of ministers is headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and will submit its plans within a month.																								Results of the assembly elections in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh are likely to influence the proposal of the ministers. One option before the ministers is a rejig of customs and excise duties that make up 50 per cent of fuel prices.																								In petrol, an excise duty cut of a rupee will give the state-owned oil marketing companies Rs 552.5 crore of extra revenues by the end of this fiscal.																								A similar cut in diesel will fetch Rs 2,113.4 crore. 																								Marginal changes in duties are unlikely to put pressure on fiscal deficit targets. Under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, the Centre has set a deficit target of 3.3 per cent of the gross domestic product for this fiscal and 3 per cent for 2008-09.																								Besides Mukherjee, other members of the group of ministers are finance minister P. Chidambaram, railway minister Lalu Prasad, consumer affairs minister Sharad Pawar, road transport and highways minister T.R. Baalu, petroleum minister Murli Deora and deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia.																								Of the members, only Ahluwalia is in favour of passing on the hike in crude prices to consumers. 																								The Indian basket of crude has climbed 145 per cent since April 2004 and during this period, petrol prices have gone up by just 29 per cent and diesel, 40 per cent.																								The state-owned oil marketing companies  the Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited are projected to lose Rs 70,500 crore from fuel sales this fiscal.																								Oil bonds are likely to compensate them for 43 per cent of their losses, while assistance from upstream government entities  the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, GAIL (India) Limited and Oil India Limited  will compensate for another 35 per cent of the losses.

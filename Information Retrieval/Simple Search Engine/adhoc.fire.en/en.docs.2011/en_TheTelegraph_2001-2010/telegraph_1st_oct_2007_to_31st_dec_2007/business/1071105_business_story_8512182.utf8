				 Funds bait for African oil
 R. SURYAMURTHYNew Delhi, Nov. 4: The government is planning to give financial assistance to oil-rich African countries in return for access to crude and gas reserves.																								Such a strategy is in the light of a flare-up in the global price of crude that has made it necessary for the country to look beyond West Asia for its supplies. 																								India imports 75 per cent of its crude requirements, with 73 per cent coming from West Asia and 16 per cent from Africa. 																								This approach is similar to the one being followed by China. Recently, the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has one-tenth of the worlds copper reserves, gave a Chinese company a majority stake in a mining joint venture as well as mineral rights, in return for a $5-billion loan.																								Cash support																								The Indian government is now finalising a line of credit that can be offered to the African nations for securing oil and gas blocks, petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan said.																								He said the target was to raise imports from the region by about 32 per cent over the next two to three years. 																								Besides oil and gas fields, Indian companies will participate in refineries, petrochemical plants and pipelines.																								On the drawing board are soft loans at the rate of 0.5-1.75 per cent interest for a period of 15 to 20 years. The money can be used for infrastructure as well as for oil sector projects. Till now, India has extended soft loans worth $500 million to African countries.																								Resource-rich																								Africa has reserves of 112.6 billion barrels, accounting for around 10 per cent of the worlds oil. 																								Crude production is at 10,410 barrels per day, which is 13 per cent of the world output. However, its consumption at 2,944 barrels per day is just 3 per cent of the global consumption. 																								The continent has natural gas reserves of 14,461 billion cubic meters, which is 4 per cent of the worlds total proven reserves. Gas production has more than doubled in the last 10 years to 185.02 billion cubic meters from 88.5 billion cubic meters. 																								Liquified natural gas capacity is 54.3 million tonnes per annum. 																								This is 30 per cent of the global capacity and expected to more than double by 2010.																								ONGC Videsh Ltd has invested about $2 billion in the continent and has a presence in Sudan, Libya, Egypt and Nigeria. 																								The consortium of Indian Oil Corporation and Oil India has two blocks in Libya and one block each in Nigeria and Gabon. 																								In Egypt, GAIL has entered into a joint venture for a gas distribution project. In Libya, it has signed up for pipeline and city gas projects. 																								ONGC Videsh managing director R.S. Butola said his company would like to consolidate its operations in Africa.																								China factor																								Indias imports from Africa as a percentage of its total imports, at 16-17 per cent, are on a par with China. 																								China has been wooing African nations with soft loans, development aid, arms transfers and political support, for oil reserves. 																								In volumes, it imports 36-37 million tonnes from Africa out of its total import of 207 million tonnes. 																								India, however, has been slow in its drive to tie up with energy sources. 																								A study of Chinas gas and oil import strategy reveals Beijings heavy reliance on imports till 2020 because of the countrys high rate of economic growth and limited hydrocarbon resources. 																								Even if Chinas gross domestic product does not rise beyond 6 per cent, well below the 1990-2000 average, oil imports will exceed 6 million barrels per day by 2020, which are more than six times the level in 1999. 																								Estimated gas imports will also be high  rising to about 25 billion cubic metres per year by 2010, and as much as 50 billion cubic metres per by 2020, the report said.

				 Glenmark prescription for generics 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT			Growth boostersMumbai, Nov. 7: Glenmark Pharmaceuticals plans to hive off its generics and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business into a separate, wholly owned subsidiary  Glenmark Generics Ltd. 																								The new company will be listed on stock exchanges by the first quarter of 2008-09. 																								The parent company will look after Glenmarks specialty business and retain all branded generic sales groups and the remaining research and development work for new chemical entities.																								Both our specialty and generics business have grown immensely, making it difficult to manage two large, but diverse disciplines. We also need to strengthen our R amp;D operations and accelerate our growth in the generics and API business. The new company will handle the development, manufacture and marketing of generic formulation and API businesses, said Glenn Saldanha, chief executive officer and managing director of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals. 																								The company will not dilute more than 30 per cent stake in Glenmark Generics through a fresh issue of shares in the proposed initial public offering. 																								New acquisitions																								Glenmark is scouting for acquisitions in the generics segment in untapped markets such as Japan and South Africa. 																								It plans to use the proceeds from the public offering to fund Glenmark Generics global expansion. 																								The generics business will manage the Goa plant for formulations, the three API facilities in India, sales units in the US and the UK and oncology operations in Argentina. 																								An R amp;D group on API and formulation development will also be transferred to Glenmark Generics. 																								Terrance Coughlin, who is the president of the API and generics division, will take over as the chief executive officer of the new entity. 																								Clinical trials																								According to the company, its first three molecules are in Phase II of clinical trials and are expected to be launched before 2012. 																								Eleven other molecules are in the early stages of testing. 																								Sources said the company distributed at least 20 generic products in the US, the largest market for Glenmark. 																								It plans to launch another 20 products in this segment next year. 																								Glenmark aims to become a generic and API leader with over 170 generics in the US, and more than 70 generic dossiers for the European market by 2015. 																								The company expects to garner revenues worth $306 million from its speciality business and $180 million from generics for the year ending March 2008. 																								Overseas sales contribute over 60 per cent to the companys sales. 																								In 2006-07, Glenmarks generics business generated a revenue of $90 million and the r amp;d segment, $147 million. 																								Both the businesses are growing at the same rate. The ebidta margins of both the business are 25-30 per cent. But there has been a substantial jump in r amp;d revenues because of milestone payments, Saldanha said.

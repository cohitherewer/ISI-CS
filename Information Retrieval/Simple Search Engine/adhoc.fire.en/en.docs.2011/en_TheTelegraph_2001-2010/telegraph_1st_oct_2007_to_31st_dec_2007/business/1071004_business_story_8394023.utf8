				 Peers beat sensex
 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY																								Calcutta, Oct. 3: Sensex returns are the lowest among Bric countries for the 12 months ended September. Bric is the acronym for Brazil, Russia, India and China, the fastest growing emerging markets in the world. 																								The sensex gained 38.84 per cent during this period, while Chinas Shenzens SZSE 100 and Shanghai SSE 180 indices yielded returns of 323.77 per cent and 286.54 per cent, respectively.																								Russias RTS gave a 72.37 per cent return and Brazils Bovespa IbrX-50, 68.54 per cent. Chiles Santiago IPSA and Indonesias Jakarta LQ45 Index grew by more than 50 per cent.																								The sensex rose from 100 to 5005.82 between April 1979  the base year for the index  and December 1999, giving a compounded annual return (excluding dividends paid by the index companies) of 21.61 per cent.																								At that rate, sensex should have touched 19690.66 in December 2006, while by September this year it should have reached 22802.75 and 23945.81 by December.																								In contrast, the sensex today closed at 17847.04, a return of 28 per cent this year.																								Sensex returns had been higher before the economic reforms of 1991. Launched in 1986, the sensex offered an annual return of 23.59 per cent till 1990. From 1991 to 1999, the return was 19.24 per cent; from 2000 to 2006 it was 15.57 per cent.																								In the eighties, the high return was the result of a jump in the growth rate to 5.5 per cent from 3 per cent in the seventies.																								The reforms of the nineties could not lift the growth rate to a significantly higher level. The average growth rate in the nineties was 5.9 per cent against 5.5 per cent in the eighties. 																								Besides, inflation was also higher at 8.13 per cent against 7.97 per cent in the eighties. The early years of the last decade were also the period of the Harshad Mehta scam that threw the markets out of gear.																								The new millennium began in the midst of an economic slowdown that lasted till 2003. From 2003-04 till date, the average growth rate is more than 8 per cent. This led to the uptrend in stocks.

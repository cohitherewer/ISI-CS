				 Decks cleared for SBI rights offer
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Green signal																								New Delhi, Nov. 30: The Union cabinet has approved a rights issue by the State Bank of India (SBI) of around Rs 16,700 crore.																								Permission was also given to the government to give the bank Rs 10,000 crore as its contribution to the issue. The government has a 59.7 per cent stake in the countrys largest bank.																								We have decided to subscribe to the rights issue. We intend to issue bonds worth Rs 10,000 crore for the purpose, finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters here today.																								He said the bonds would be redeemed through the proposed securities redemption fund, to be financed by taxes and dividends received from the SBI.																								The annual cost of servicing the bonds will be around Rs 790 crore, and the government sees no outgo on this count in this fiscal.																								Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the rights issue would be completed by the end of this fiscal.																								SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had earlier said that the bank needed funds not only for growth but also to meet Basel-II norms on capital adequacy.																								The bank requires close to Rs 5,000 crore just for Basel, Bhatt said. It also needs capital for complying with the AS15 accounting standard that mandates disclosure of pension liabilities.																								For expansion, the bank needs around Rs 100,000 crore, of which about Rs 17,000 crore will come from the rights issue.																								Some of the money will be used to shore up the capital base of subsidiary companies. The bank has said that it will infuse Rs 500-1,000 crore in SBI Life Insurance.																								Das Munshi said the number of shares to be offered, the coupon rate of the bonds and their tenure would be worked out in consultation with the SBI. 																								Sources said the issue was likely to be at a discount to market prices, and the bank might offer one share for every two held.

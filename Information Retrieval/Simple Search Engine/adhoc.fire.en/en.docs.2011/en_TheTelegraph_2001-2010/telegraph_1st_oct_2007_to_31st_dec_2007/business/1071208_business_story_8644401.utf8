				 Fillip for small savings

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								New Delhi, Dec. 7: The post office monthly income account today regained some of its lost glory, when the government decided to restore bonus though at a reduced rate. In a simultaneous move, it extended income tax rebate to two other small saving schemes.
																								The decision is significant as the government is looking at increasing household savings to spur investment. Total savings is now pegged at over 30 per cent of the gross domestic product.
																								Once popular among middle-class households, the post office monthly income scheme (MIS) lost favour after the government scrapped the 10 per cent bonus a few years back. 
																								The bonus, though restored, will now stand reduced at 5 per cent. It will be applicable to new accounts under the scheme from tomorrow, a statement by the finance ministry said.
																								Together with the bonus, the effective yield will be 8.9 per cent against 8.3 per cent at present. The return of 8.9 per cent compares favourably with the return on bank deposits or government securities of comparable maturity, the statement added.
																								The statement said, It is important that interest rates applicable to small savings schemes should match returns that are available on other savings instruments of comparable maturity. 
																								The government also extended the income tax rebate to five-year post office time deposit account and senior citizens savings scheme on the pattern of five-year bank deposits.
																								The tax rebate will be available under section 80C of the income tax act that allows taxpayers to avail themselves of deductions on investments up to Rs 1,00,000 in a financial year. 
																								The limit is irrespective of how much an individual earns and under which tax bracket the person falls.
																								The benefit of the deduction shall be available to investments made under these two schemes with effect from the current financial year 2007-08, the finance ministry statement said.
																								Tax expert Sudatta Sen said, There are no sub-limits under this Rs 1,00,000 ceiling. So if an investor wants, he or she can invest the entire amount in any one instrument. 
																								Some of the investment instruments that fall under section 80C are public provident fund, life insurance premium, pension plans, equity-linked savings scheme and infrastructure bonds.
																								Among the small savings schemes, the five-year post office time deposit account and the senior citizens savings scheme have proved to be popular, the statement said.
																								The Centre took the decision after examining requests from state governments. Last month, the Centre had invited state finance ministers to send their responses to certain specific proposals.

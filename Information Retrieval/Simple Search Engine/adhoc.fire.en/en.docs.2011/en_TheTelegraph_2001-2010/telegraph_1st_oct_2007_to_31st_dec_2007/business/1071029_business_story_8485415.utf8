				 Govt favours auctions for 3G spectrum
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Call waiting																								New Delhi, Oct. 28: The government is keen on auctions for 3G spectrum, to be vacated by the defence authorities next year.																								Officials said, Based on the recommendations made by the Telecom Commission, the telecom ministry is most likely to go ahead with 3G auction. 																								A policy report on third-generation (3G) mobile services prepared by the Telecom Commission, the apex body of the department of telecommunications (DoT), is with communications minister A. Raja.																								In the report, the commission has recommended that spectrum for 3G services be offered through auctions, where all players  existing operators, licence holders and international players  will be allowed to bid. 																								This is a departure from the proposal of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to allow only existing operators bid for the spectrum. 																								The telecom ministry is likely to allow each GSM operator to bid for 10 MHz of the spectrum against the 5 MHz proposed by Trai, the officials said. 																								Such a move will double the proposed base price for the spectrum to Rs 2,800 crore per player compared with Trais suggestion of about Rs 1,400 crore. 3G mobile technology facilitates many advanced applications such as real-time financial transactions, video streaming and voice services.																								However, the defence ministry has demanded an alternative secure route of communication from the DoT before it releases the spectrum.																								In late 2006, state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited had awarded a Rs 591-crore contract to information technology vendor HCL Infosystems Limited for a dedicated fibre optic network for defence establishments. 																								Allocation by April																								According to DoT estimates, some circles may get their quota of the spectrum by April 2008, while others may not get anything at all.																								Delhi is expected to get 30MHz by April, the sole circle to get the full quota.																								Rajasthan, Haryana and Bengal are likely to have about 25 MHz of 3G spectrum within this period.																								Mumbai, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh (west) and Himachal Pradesh will have about 20 MHz, while Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh (east) and Bihar will get about 15MHz.

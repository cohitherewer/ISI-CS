				 Left waves red flag at P-notes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 19: The Left today told the Centre to prohibit participatory notes (P-notes) and take immediate steps to moderate capital flows into stock markets.																								A statement by the CPM politburo said: The party is of the firm opinion that P-notes should be prohibited as has been recommended by the RBI. 																								Party MP Nilotpal Basu said the party had raised the issue even at the time of the 2001 stock scam, when the NDA was in power. The money being pumped in through participatory notes is faceless money. It could be money brought in to rig stocks at best. At worst it is graft or other illegal funds being legitimised. 																								P-notes are derivative instruments used by global hedge funds and overseas investors who wish to conceal their identities. Critics say the notes are a way to bring in illegal funds. Several expert committees have sought their phaseout and an eventual ban.																								The CPMs demand has come at a time when the Centre is trying to assuage fears of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) over the proposed curbs on the notes by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.																								The government is saying that the curbs on the notes are intended to stabilise stock markets and not ban them altogether.																								In its statement, the CPM has criticised the finance ministry for ignoring a Reserve Bank recommendation to phase out the notes.																								Finance ministry officials, however, said Sebis proposals were the result of monitoring P-notes. 																								Besides the notes, the CPM expressed concern over volatility in the markets. The politburo said the sell-offs over the past few days reflected defiance of the countrys regulatory authorities by the FIIs. 																								It said it has repeatedly urged the UPA government to reverse the capital account liberalisation measures initiated by the former NDA government.																								Even the common minimum programme (CMP) has promised to take steps to reduce the vulnerability of the financial system to the flow of speculative capital, the party said.

				 Still a long way to go, says Puri
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 (From left) Citi Bank CEO Sanjay Nayar with Max India chairman Analjit Singh and RBI deputy governor Usha Thorat at the two-day banking conclave in Mumbai on Monday. (Fotocorp)																								Mumbai, Nov. 26: Indian banks still have a long a way to go before meeting global standards of margins and profitability given the high cost of access and low financial inclusion.																								Refuting the McKinsey report, Aditya Puri, managing director of HDFC Bank, said the suggested 5 per cent margin in the banking sector was actually inappropriate, when the parameters of cash reserve ratio (CRR), statutory liquidity requirement (SLR), and priority sector lending were factored in. 																								Puri said with the CRR at 7.5 per cent and the SLR at about 25 per cent, a margin of 5 per cent on our deposits is virtually impossible and would rather be somewhat lower.																								He said Indian banks would take some more years to become globally competitive. 																								To make the banking business more profitable and reach the untapped Indian masses, we have to reduce the cost of access to financial services. While mobile banking can act as one solution to this issue, we have to continue to look for more cost-effective ways to bring down intermediation costs, Puri said. 																								If liquidity and inflation continue to remain at the present levels, the cost of deposits will go down and a consequent cut in interest rates can be expected, Puri added.

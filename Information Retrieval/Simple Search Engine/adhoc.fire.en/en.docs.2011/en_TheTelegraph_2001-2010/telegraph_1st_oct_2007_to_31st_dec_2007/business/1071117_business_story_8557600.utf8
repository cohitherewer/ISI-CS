				 Carlsberg buys 60% of Parag
 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE				 	 Beer hug																								New Delhi, Nov. 16: Denmark-based beer manufacturer Carlsberg has acquired a 60 per cent stake in Parag Breweries. This is expected to increase Carlsbergs capacity by 1.6 lakh hecta litres (hl).																								Joakim Sande, marketing director of South Asia Breweries, through which Carlsberg operates in India, said, We are looking for a stronghold in the eastern market. Parag Breweries in Bengal proved to be a great opportunity. We will start production there in the first quarter of 2008.																								South Asia Breweries is a joint venture between Carlsberg, Denmarks Industrialisation Fund for Developing Countries (IFU) and a group of investors.																								Carlsberg has a 45 per cent stake in South Asia Breweries, the IFU holds 10 per cent, while a group of investors, led by Carlsbergs Sri Lankan partner Lion Brewery Ceylon Ltd, hold the rest. 																								Sande said South Asia Breweries would not have any stake in Agnes Impex, which is a holding company for Parag Breweries. Beer produced in the Parag facility will be for the Bengal market initially. Later on, Carlsberg may use this brewery to cater to other states as well.																								He added that Carlsberg was evaluating more opportunities to expand in India. We hope to be a major player here very soon, he said. We are planning to launch around five brands next year. However, our focus at the moment will remain on our premium beer brand Carlsberg.

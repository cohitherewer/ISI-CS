				 Sri Lanka lifts trophy in salary sweepstakes
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, Nov. 21: India has lost its pre-eminent position in the salary hike league tables for Asia Pacific.																								Sri Lanka has nudged India into second place in 2007 with an average salary increase of 15.3 per cent against 14.8 per cent in India, which held the pole position for the past four years.																								In 2008, Sri Lanka is projected to retain the top slot with an average salary hike of 15.2 per cent against 14.4 per cent in India.																								In its eighth annual Asia-Pacific salary increase survey, Hewitt Associates said the pay hikes in Sri Lanka were high because of a booming economy that wasnt trammelled by high energy prices and civil conflict, and high inflationary pressures.																								Hewitt, a global human resources services company, says Sri Lanka and India are followed in the pecking order by Vietnam and China.																								The average salary hike in India of 14.8 per cent in 2007 is higher than the 14.4 per cent in the previous year, the report added.																								Sri Lanka has seen double-digit inflation in the past year and this has led to higher salaries. Inflation and salary hikes have a strong connection, Nishchae Suri, Hewitt Associates head (talent and organisation consulting analytics practice in Asia) told The Telegraph.																								Suri said inequalities in compensation had also led to higher attrition.																								Vietnams booming economy reported an unprecedented increase of 10.3 per cent in salaries, toppling China from the traditional second spot on the charts in earlier years.																								Salaries in China rose by 8.6 per cent, up from 8.3 per cent last year. For the third year in a row, the Philippines recorded an average overall salary increase of 8.2 per cent, the report said. 																								Despite all the high salary hikes in Asia, compensation doesnt seem to be having the desired impact. The overall employee satisfaction with current compensation stands at 46 per cent. This means that apart from the absolute, there are aspects which need serious attention. Companies need to focus on making pay more transparent by making it competitive and aligning it to performance, Suri said.																								Most companies believe that to be in the game, one has to pay higher than the competition, but most companies are spending without a return focus in mind. If money is being treated as the differentiator, then it is a very short-term strategy, Suri added. 																								Asia was followed by Latin America where Venezuela led with an average salary hike of 18.8 per cent. Europe reported the third highest salary increase globally with Hungary leading the region with an increase of 7.5 per cent. 																								Hewitts study indicates that variable pay continues to be an important means of attracting and retaining talent, with 91.8 per cent of responding organisations using this practice.																								Within variable pay choices, individual performance awards continue to be the most popular, with nearly 68 per cent of responding organisations saying that this is their preferred type of variable pay plan, followed by special recognition awards and business incentives, says the report. 																								The pull is on the side of the people today. With more opportunities and avenues, organisations are increasingly at the mercy of employees making a choice, said Suri.

																								New Delhi, Dec. 18: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has announced its special savings scheme  Happy Customer Offer  to woo customers. The company said it would offer discounts ranging between Rs 18,500 and Rs 57,500 across various models.
																								Automobile firms announce hefty discounts in December to lure customers who postpone buying a car to the beginning of a new year as it increases resale value. 
																								The discount is expected to be greeted well by customers as most car companies are planning to increase prices next month. 
																								Companies usually hike prices in January to offset any adverse impact of a tax or duty hike in the budget and keep their margins secure. 
																								Under the scheme, the company will offer a discount of Rs 18,500 on the Omni and its flagship hatchback Maruti 800 will be cheaper by Rs 26,000. The company is offering a maximum discount of Rs 57,500 on its mid-size sedan, the Esteem.
																								The Alto will be available at a discount of Rs 24,500. The Wagon Rs petrol and LPG versions will cost Rs 45,000 and Rs 24,500 less, respectively. A discount of Rs 48,000 is being offered on the Zen Estilo.
																								Like other car manufacturers, Maruti is also expected to increase prices of its various models by up to Rs 12,000 in January because of a hike in the cost of raw materials and spares. The company has already informed its dealers about the proposed price hike.
																								The company is not offering any discount on either the diesel or petrol variants of its premium hatchback Swift and premium sedan SX4 as there is a demand and supply mismatch.
																								Other car companies which have decided to increase prices include Hyundai Motors India, Skoda India and General Motors India.

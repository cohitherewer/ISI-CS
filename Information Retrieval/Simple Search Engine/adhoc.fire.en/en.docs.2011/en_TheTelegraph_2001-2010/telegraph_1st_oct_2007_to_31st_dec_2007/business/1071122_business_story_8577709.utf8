				 Timken open to Tata reunion
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 21: Roller bearing maker Timken is open to renewing its alliance with the Tata group.																								The duo had a joint venture called Tata Timken, in which the Tatas sold their stake to the US-based Timken in 1999. The company is now called Timken India, in which Timken holds 80 per cent. Timken India is listed on the local bourses.																								The Tatas wanted to specialise in areas where we did not have core expertise. Therefore, we chose to part ways. We are open to forging an alliance with them if the opportunity comes up. However, there are no concrete plans yet, said Timken India managing director Gordon W. Robinson on the sidelines of an American Chamber of Commerce seminar in Calcutta.																								Timken entered into the joint venture with the Tatas in the late eighties. It set up a unit in Jamshedpur, which primarily served the rail and road sector. The plant supplied bearings to the Tata Motors factory there. 																								When asked whether the parent company wanted to delist Timken India, Robinson said he could not divulge any details. 																								Chennai plant																								The companys second manufacturing unit, which is being set up in the Mahindra SEZ in Chennai, will be operational by the middle of next year.																								The company has made an initial investment of $25 million for the first phase of the plant. However, investment in the new unit will not be routed through Timken India. 																								The unit, which is expected to clock sales of $50 million in the first full year of operation, will be involved in manufacturing, while Timken India will take up sales and marketing activities. 																								Robinson said sales were expected to double as the Chennai facility will be expanded in the future.																								Order book																								We are getting orders from the private sector as well as for government projects. The recent spate of infrastructure projects in the country makes us very bullish about this sector, which our Chennai plant will cater to, Robinson added.

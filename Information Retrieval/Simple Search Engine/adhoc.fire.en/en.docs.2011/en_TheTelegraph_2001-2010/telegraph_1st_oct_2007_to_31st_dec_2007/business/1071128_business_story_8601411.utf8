				 Spectrum ball in Rajas court
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Raja: Mediator																								New Delhi, Nov. 27: Communications minister A. Raja will hold discussions with the warring telecom players and come out with the final spectrum allocation norms only after the Parliament session is over.																								Prior to meeting the telecom operators, the minister will confer with department of telecom (DoT) officials on the recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and the Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC) on subscriber-linked allocations of radiowaves. 																								I may meet the operators. Let me discuss with the committee constituted for reviewing the recommendations of the TEC about the outcome of first round of meeting with service providers on Monday, said Raja. 																								He, however, gave no time frame as to when this battle for radiowaves would be resolved.																								The government is also planning to form a sub-group under the national security adviser for the vacation of spectrum by defence forces. 																								The defence sector is expected to release around 45Mhz of radiowaves by the year-end. In return, the DoT will set up an alternative communication network.																								Spectrum or radiowaves, over which mobile services travel, is a scarce commodity. Various mobile operators, including Spice, Idea and Aircel, are awaiting spectrum allocation to start telecom services in circles where they have already received a licence.																								Meanwhile, some CDMA operators have stepped up pressure on the government to ask GSM players to surrender excess spectrum so that new players, who have been waiting for airwaves for a long time, can be accommodated. 																								However, Bharti Airtel chief Sunil Mittal contended that GSM operators were using only 25MHz of spectrum to accommodate more than 160 million subscribers.																								CDMA player Reliance Communications chairman Anil Ambani had also said that annual spectrum charges should be fixed at 10 per cent of the annual gross revenue in the case of allotment of spectrum beyond the contracted quantity of 6.2MHz. 																								The TEC, the technical arm of the DoT, had suggested that telecom companies should increase their subscriber base between four and 15 times before they are granted additional spectrum.																								Raja had accepted the TECs report in-principle, but facing stiff opposition from the GSM lobby, the department set up a fresh committee to review the recent report of the TEC.																								The new committee, which is meeting again on November 30, was earlier directed to submit its report by the end of this month.

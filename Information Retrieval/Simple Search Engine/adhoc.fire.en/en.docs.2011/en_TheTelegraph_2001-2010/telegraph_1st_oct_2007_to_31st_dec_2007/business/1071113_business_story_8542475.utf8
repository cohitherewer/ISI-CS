				 UTI Mutual in core sector push
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 12: UTI Mutual Fund expects to raise over Rs 4,000 crore from one of its biggest new fund offers (NFOs)  the Infrastructure Advantage Fund-Series I.																								Infrastructure funds have become the biggest moneyspinners for the mutual fund industry in recent months with the government projecting investments of over $400 billion till 2012 in this area.																								UTI Mutual had earlier raised Rs 2,100 crore from its Leadership Fund.																								Available in two options  growth and dividend, the three-year closed end equity scheme aims to provide medium-to-long-term capital appreciation by investing predominantly in equities of equity-related instruments of infrastructure companies. Of the total corpus, 10 per cent is likely to come from global retail investors, primarily from West Asia. 																								The scheme, with a portfolio size of about 50 stocks, will invest in sectors such as construction, energy, engineering, metals, power, telecom, transportation and airports. 																								The fund house has a track record of managing an existing fund in the infrastructure sector, which has an open-ended architecture and has given handsome return. The scheme, which closes on December 19, has a minimum investment of Rs 5,000. The fund will invest 65 to 100 per cent in equity and equity-related instruments of such companies and zero to 35 per cent in debt and money market instruments, including securitised debt. The fund is a closed end scheme with a maturity period of three years.																								Recently, market regulator Sebi raised the limit on overseas investments by individual mutual funds to $300 million. Earlier, the limit was $200 million or 8 to 10 per cent of the total assets under management, whichever was lower. The relaxation came after the Reserve Bank of India eased overseas investment norms to rein in the rupee.																								The new limit set for individual funds is subject to the overall ceiling of $5 billion for each mutual fund house.																								The sub-ceiling linked to the net assets of a mutual fund as on March 31 of each year has been dispensed with, Sebi said.																								Assets under management of mutual funds in October stood at Rs 560,000 crore compared with Rs 480,000 crore in September, an increase of 17 per cent.																								On a year-on-year basis, assets rose 80.64 per cent from Rs 310,000 crore in October 2006. Reliance Mutual Fund was the largest fund house with its assets swelling to almost Rs 80,000 crore in October. This was followed by ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund and UTI Mutual Fund with assets of Rs 56,300 and Rs 51,800 crore, respectively.

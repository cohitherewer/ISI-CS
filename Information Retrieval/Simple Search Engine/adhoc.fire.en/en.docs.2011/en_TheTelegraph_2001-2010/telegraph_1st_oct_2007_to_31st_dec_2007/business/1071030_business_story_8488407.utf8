				 Two coal blocks for Mittals
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, Oct. 29: The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) has approved L.N. Mittals bid for two coal blocks in Orissa and Jharkhand.																								These are among the 15 blocks to get PMO approval for power plants. It follows months of heated debate between the coal and power ministries over the award of the blocks. The approvals were given last Friday.																								Top government officials said, The PMO has more or less accepted the recommendations made by an inter-ministry panel. Most of the blocks have been given to two or more companies. 																								Multiple allocations of a block may cause problems as many of the winning bidders are not expected to set up power plants.																								Mittal is, however, lucky. He has reputed companies as co-developers. In Orissa, it is Reliance Energy. The government has allotted the duo a part of the Rampia coal block that has 350 million tonnes (mt) of reserves. In Jharkhand, it is Hyderabad-based GVK Energy. They have been allotted the Seregarha block, which holds reserves of 160 mt. 																								Unlike Mittal, Tata Steel faced problems in obtaining blocks. 																								After an initial denial, the company got the rights to half of the reserves of the Ganeshpur block in Jharkhand.																								Tata Steels partner for Ganeshpur is the Calcutta-based Adhunik group. In its bid to the coal ministry, Adhunik proposed a power plant of 1,000MW capacity. It said its net worth was Rs 500 crore.																								At first, Tata Steel got rebuffed despite a net worth of Rs 10,281 crore. Its plan is for a 600MW plant to supply electricity to its steel mills. The officials said the allocations were based on multiple criteria such as past track record and financial and technological capabilities of the bidders.																								In its allocations, the inter-ministry panel has sought to balance the demands of both big and small companies.																								However, rejected bidders are expected to move courts against the verdicts.																								Those to get stand-alone mines include AES, Balco, Essar and Bhushan Steel. 																								The officials said the allocations should lead to the generation of 18,000MW of electricity.																								They said the government would allot 23 more coal blocks to steel and cement companies.

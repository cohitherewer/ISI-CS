				 Strike the right balance
 Get your asset allocation right and reap rich dividends, says Rishi Nathany																								Investors have never had it so good  equity markets are booming and even mutual fund managers are trying to outperform each other by delivering superior returns. 																								However, these returns have a cost attached to them, which most investors do not consider. Higher the return, higher will be the level of risk. This can prove to be dangerous when markets correct, as high-risk portfolios tend to fall very steeply at such times. 																								Therefore, investors need to create a portfolio and select investment avenues according to their risk-return profiles, so that the portfolio volatility is within their tolerance levels. 																								Available avenues																								In India, there are only a handful of generic asset classes where the common investor can invest. These are: 																								Fixed income instruments: Debt funds, bank fixed deposits, government and corporate bonds, post office schemes. Fixed income instruments are an integral part of every portfolio as they provide stability, ensure a steady stream of income as well as provide liquidity through short-term debt instruments such as liquid funds.																								Equities: You can invest directly in equities or through equity mutual funds and portfolio management schemes (PMS). Though equities are a volatile asset class in the short term, they deliver superior returns compared with other asset classes in the long term. 																								Real estate: Direct property purchases or through realty PMS funds. This asset class provides both an income stream through rentals as well as capital appreciation.																								Bullion: Gold and silver are traditionally bought for financial as well as emotional security. They are a traditional hedge against inflation and very useful assets in times of economic instability. 																								Insurance: Get cover as well as save money through conventional policies providing fixed income type returns, or through unit-linked policies, where you get fixed income, equity, or balanced returns. 																								Others: Investment in art, in foreign countries or in structured products.																								Asset allocation 																								Investors should allocate assets to suit their risk appetite. 																								Often asset allocation is not done according to ones risk-taking ability, but is based on equity market conditions. 																								As the markets go up, investors put more money into equities. However, when the markets fall they panic and sell out at losses. Had they invested according to their risk-taking ability, they would have held on to these investments and made decent profits over the long term. 																								We have created five model asset allocations to suit different risk-return profiles.																								Very conservative																								These investors seek steady income over capital appreciation and are very risk-averse. Therefore, they are willing to accept lower overall portfolio returns, which may be around 10 per cent per annum.																								Moderately conservative																								They want some capital appreciation but predominantly seek a steady income flow from their portfolio. For this, they are willing to take marginally higher risks. The annual portfolio returns here could be around 12 per cent in the long run. 																								Balanced 																								These investors seek a balance between income and capital appreciation and have a balanced approach towards risk and return. The annual expected returns from such a portfolio could be around 15 per cent over the long term.																								Moderately aggressive																								These investors prefer capital appreciation over a steady income and are willing to accept higher levels of risk for higher returns. The expected returns from such a portfolio over the long term could be around 18 per cent per annum.																								Aggressive 																								They are very aggressive investors who are willing to take on very high levels of risk and portfolio volatility for superior long-term returns of around 20 per cent per annum or more. The entire portfolio is designed towards capital appreciation and hardly any income stream is sought from such a portfolio. However, even here, at least 10 per cent is allocated to liquid fixed income investments to meet any contingencies. 																								The asset allocation charts are illustrative only and give investors a rough idea of where they stand in terms of their risk-return profiles. Two persons with the same income and in similar situations may have entirely different risk-return profiles and, therefore, different asset allocations. The key to success is to get the right mix of assets.																								(The author is a certified financial planner. He can be reached at rishitouchstonewealth.com)

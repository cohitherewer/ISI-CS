				 Boon for senior citizens

 The tax break for Senior Citizen Savings Scheme makes it the most attractive among fixed-income tax saving instruments, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay
																								Senior citizens have reason to cheer. The finance ministry has extended tax benefits under section 80C to the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme. Tax paying senior citizens can now claim a deduction of Rs 1 lakh invested in the schemes from assessment year 2008-09. 
																								The Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) was launched in August 2004. Any person who is 55 or more and has retired on superannuation or voluntarily can invest up to a maximum of Rs 15 lakh in this scheme. 
																								Interest is paid to the depositor at the end of every three months. Though withdrawal before five years of opening an account was not allowed in SCSS, the scheme gained popularity because it gave an assured annual interest of 9 per cent vis--vis a 7 to 7.5 per cent interest in bank fixed deposits at that time. 
																								However, in March last year the government announced that interest payment in SCSS was liable to tax deduction at source from the inception of the scheme. 
																								Then why do we say that the scheme has turned out to be the most attractive among fixed return instruments? Lets explore the other options and see how they match up.
																								PO term deposit
																								The ministry has also extended the tax concession to the five-year post office term deposit. However, the concession doesnt add any glitter to the scheme that pays a 7.5 per cent interest compared with 8 per cent by National Savings Certificate and Public Provident Fund. Even banks offer between 8.5 and 8.75 per cent for their tax saving as well as normal deposits of five years. 
																								Post office MIS
																								Senior citizens, who seek a regular interest income, have traditionally preferred the post office monthly income scheme (POMIS). The scheme offers an annual interest of 8 per cent, which is paid out on a monthly basis. Till February last year, depositors in POMIS would get a 10 per cent bonus on maturity after six years. However, the government withdrew the bonus last year.
																								With Parliament elections not far away, the finance ministry has restored the bonus (5 per cent) on POMIS.
																								Bank FDs
																								However, tax saving fixed deposits in some banks such as the Oriental Bank of Commerce, Uco Bank, Bank of India still fetch a higher interest for depositors who are above 60 years. But one cannot invest more than Rs 1 lakh in these deposits, while in a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, one can invest up to Rs 15 lakh at 9 per cent annual interest. 
																								However, most banks give a higher interest to their senior citizen depositors even if the deposit is not a tax-saving one. Here there is no limit on the amount that can be deposited.
																								Old is gold
																								But, now that banks have started reducing their deposit rates, it would be a wise move to keep ones money in Senior Citizen Savings Scheme where the depositor can renew it for a block of three years on maturity of the initial investment after five years. 
																								Since a depositor in a Senior Citizen Saving Scheme will have to take out the interest payment every quarter, one can increase the return by reinvesting part or the whole of the interest payout in a five-year recurring deposit (if regular payouts are not needed) in a bank giving more than 8 per cent interest. 
																								Recurring returns
																								For example, if you deposit Rs 1 lakh in an SCSS, you will get Rs 9,000 as interest every year or Rs 45,000 in five years. You can open a five-year recurring deposit with a monthly deposit of Rs 750 and earn an annual interest of 8 per cent. After five years, you will amass Rs 55,535 in the recurring deposit account. That is a gain of Rs 10,535 per Rs 1 lakh in five years. However, you cannot follow this strategy if it is a bank fixed deposit because banks pay a cumulative interest. Rs 1 lakh kept in a five-year bank fixed deposit will earn you an interest of Rs 56,051 at maturity. 
																								Therefore, elderly people should look at SCSS for claiming tax deduction and regular income. For capital accumulation, choose bank fixed deposits. If you have retirement savings of Rs 30 lakh, keep Rs 10 lakh in an SCSS account and Rs 20 lakh in a five-year bank fixed deposit. From the SCSS account, you will earn Rs 22,500 every three months (Rs 7,500 every month). From the bank fixed deposit, you will earn Rs 1,86,167 every year, if you take out the interest at the end of every year.

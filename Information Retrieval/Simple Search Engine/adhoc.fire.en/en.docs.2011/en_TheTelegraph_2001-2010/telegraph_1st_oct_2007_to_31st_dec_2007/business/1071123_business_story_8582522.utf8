				 RBI vows steps to keep rupee steady 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 22: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been actively intervening in the currency market and will continue to use various options to help stem the rise of the rupee.																								We have a managed float, but we do intervene in the market actively, RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan said today.																								A managed float is an exchange rate system where a currencys value is allowed to be determined by the market, but where a central bank still intervenes to prevent sharp changes. 																								The RBI bought almost $52 billion in the first nine months of 2007 to curb rupee gains against the dollar. However, despite the prolonged intervention, the rupee has risen about 12 per cent this year, eroding the competitiveness of Indian exporters, who are worried they can lose large markets if the rupee continues to grow. 																								We have followed an unorthodox approach in the conduct of the monetary policy, Mohan said. We have succeeded in cooling down certain parts of the market. We will do whatever is necessary when the market situation demands. We are ready to use all instruments  market stabilisation scheme, liquidity adjustment facility, and CRR  depending on the situation, he said.																								Though the RBI official did not say so, bankers accept that state-run banks have also intervened in the market by buying dollars to raise the dollars value against the rupee on instructions from the central bank.																								The RBI has raised the cash reserve ratio several times and sold market intervention bonds to soak up surplus cash with banks and ease price pressures. The Institute of Economic Growth believes the widening of the trade deficit because of the slowdown of Indian exports would restrain the rupee from further appreciation.

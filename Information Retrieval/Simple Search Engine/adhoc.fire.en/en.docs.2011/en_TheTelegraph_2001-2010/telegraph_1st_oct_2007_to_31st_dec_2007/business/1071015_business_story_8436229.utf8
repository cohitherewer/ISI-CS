				 Star hotels revel in small town delights
 GARIMA SINGH NEOGY																								New Delhi, Oct. 14: Five-star hotel chains are flocking to smaller cities.																								Big names such as the Oberoi group, the Taj group, ITC, Carlson Hospitality, the Accor group and Bharat Hotels are preparing their spread for cities such as Jalandhar, Surat, Indore, Nagpur and Agartala. 																								A saturated market in the metros, demand for budget hotels and the growth of small cities have encouraged the expansion of these chains.																								After tapping the commercial suburbs of Delhi, Oberois Trident Hotels has spread to Agra, Jaipur, Udaipur, Bhubaneswar, Chennai and Kochi and may go to Chandigarh. The Trident now has 1,900 rooms and plans to add another 1,300 in the next few years. 																								We see a number of opportunities for Trident hotels in other cities, which we are pursuing, P.R.S Oberoi, chairman of the Oberoi group, said. 																								Rajesh Mishra, president of the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India, said: The market in the metros is getting saturated. Land prices have shot up, making it unviable to sustain projects. Hotels are now diverting their investments to smaller cities to capitalise on their commercial and industrial growth. 																								Ginger Hotels, the no-frills brand of Roots Corporation, a 100 per cent subsidiary of the Tatas Indian Hotels, opened its first hotel in Bhubaneswar recently. 																								 The group is in talks with real estate developers in small cities to open 100-room properties in commercial complexes, said Prabhat Pani, CEO of Ginger Hotels. 																								It is developing a property at a mall in Ludhiana, Punjab, where it has rented the fourth and fifth floors. Ginger plans two more hotels at malls in Amritsar and Mohali.																								Apart from Ahmedabad, the company is also planning hotels at IT parks and special economic zones. 																								The first Ginger property was set up in Bangalore in June 2004. The chain now operates in Durgapur, Bhubaneswar, Hardwar, Mysore, Thiruvananthapuram and Pune. Properties in Goa, Nashik, Agartala and Pondicherry are also on the anvil. 																								The company plans to have about 40 such hotels in various business and leisure destinations in the next couple of years. 																								According to industry estimates, at least 50 small cities will have three to four international and domestic brands each in the next five to seven years. 																								Carlson Hotels Asia Pacific plans to open its Radisson Hotels amp; Resorts in Chilika, Puri and Bhubaneswar. 																								Park Inn, Radisson and Country Inns and Suites will also go to Ludhiana, Amritsar, Indore, Ahmedabad, Manesar, Nagpur, Rudrapur and Baddi. 																								Analysts said the industry was poised for maximum growth in smaller cities in the coming years with realtors entering the market. 																								The hotel industry is growing because of the real estate boom and we want to encash the opportunity. There is a bigger potential for growth in smaller towns, says Pradeep Jain, chairman of Parsvanath Developers. 																								The company, a real estate developer, has entered the hotels business. It is now setting up properties in Ujjain, Hardwar, Indore, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kochi. Jain adds that the growth in the industry will be largely in Tier II and Tier III cities in the next five years.																								ITC, through its Fortune Park Hotels, will cater to executives selling mobile phones, toothpaste and financial services to the rural population, said a senior company official. 																								At present, there are some 1,980 establishments approved and classified by the ministry of tourism, with a total capacity of about 1,10,000 rooms. 																								Bharat Hotels plans to open up to 25 budget hotels in the country in the next 2-3 years.																								In the next 24-36 months, we will open 20-25 budget hotels in different cities, said Jyotsna Suri, the chairperson of Bharat Hotels. 																								The group will come up with hotels in Tier II cities such as Jalandar, Surat, and Ludhiana.

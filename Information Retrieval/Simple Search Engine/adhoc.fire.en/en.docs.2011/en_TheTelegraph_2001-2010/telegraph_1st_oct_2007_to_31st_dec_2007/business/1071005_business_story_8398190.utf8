				 Telecom rules in 10 days 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 4: The government has decided to resolve the row over radiowaves within the next 10 days by issuing new guidelines for telecom licence and spectrum.																								A committee has been formed to scrutinise the details of new applications and spectrum related issues. It will submit its report in 10 days, said telecom minister A. Raja.																								For fresh spectrum allocation, existing operators, licence holders without spectrum and fresh applicants will be treated separately, the minister said.																								The department of telecom (DoT) has a huge task, with more than 300 players applying for licences and existing players demanding more spectrum. 																								It has to first identify the serious applicants and then prepare a spectrum allocation policy keeping in mind that some of the existing players are in the spectrum queue for over two years. 																								Officials said options before the DoT include raising the net worth criteria for licence seekers to about Rs 2,000 crore from Rs 1,300 crore and asking companies to convert their letter of intent into licences within 10 days.																								Applicants may be also asked to give their plans in greater detail, including partners for national and international long-distance operations and sources of funding. 																								The department feels asking operational details from companies will help it in identifying spurious applications.																								The DoT internal committee, which will rework the existing policy norms, may do away with the first come, first served clause and delink licences from spectrum allocation. 																								The current policy allocates 2G spectrum on a first come, first served basis. The spectrum also comes with the licence for a circle.

				 Maruti boss thinks global

 GARIMA SINGH
																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: The new head of Maruti Suzuki India, Shinzo Nakanishi, plans to transform the India manufacturing unit into an export hub for Suzuki Motor Corporation. 
																								This unit will contribute to a third of the parent companys global sales.
																								To meet its sales target, Maruti Suzuki India will manufacture small cars exclusively for export to European countries. 
																								The newly appointed managing director said, in an e-mailed interview to The Telegraph, Maruti Suzuki would make two new compact cars  Splash and A-Star from next year for export to Europe.
																								Of the three million cars that Suzuki wants to sell worldwide (by 2010), almost 30 per cent has to come from Maruti Suzuki, he said adding that the company would play a larger role in Suzukis global operations.
																								Maruti has set a production target of one million (10 lakh) units by 2010 and has invested about Rs 9,000 crore to meet it. 
																								In Japan, Suzuki Motor has production capacity for about six lakh small cars, one lakh big cars and another 1.5 lakh cars that are supplied to companies such as Nissan and Mazda.
																								Nakanishi said India would be a key supplier to Suzuki Motors global sales. 
																								Other markets such as Indonesia, Europe and Latin America would also contribute in a big way.
																								Maruti Suzuki is also ramping up its research and development facilities in India to bring it on a par with Suzukis R amp; D centre in Japan. 
																								Engineers in Maruti are developing next generation engines, which are likely to be available in the next three to five years.

				 Eicher weighs overseas tie-ups
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 4: Eicher Motors, the third-largest manufacturer of heavy trucks in the country, is weighing alliances with global players to offer all types of commercial vehicles. 																								Eicher Motors is focused on becoming a complete commercial vehicle player. In our endeavour to strengthen presence across the Indian commercial vehicle landscape, we are considering strategic alliances, the company said in a statement issued today.																								There are reports of Swedens Volvo, the worlds second-largest truck manufacturer, being the front-runner in acquiring a majority stake in Eicher.																								The reports suggest that Volvo is in talks with Eicher, with the Swedish company making an offer of Rs 675 per share. This is much higher than the Rs 500 offered by DaimlerChrysler earlier. 																								However, Eicher Group chairman S. Sandilya told The Telegraph, We have been talking to many international companies  we have been open about it. When anything concrete comes up in the future, the board will take it up. 																								DaimlerChrysler were reportedly keen on a majority stake in Eicher. 																								Daimler holds a 3.56 per cent indirect stake in Eicher, while the promoters own about 58 per cent. The companys scrip rose 16 per cent to Rs 497 on the BSE today, taking the market capitalisation to $352 million.

				 Lehman bets on success story
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 16: The Indian economy will grow 10 per cent a year over the next decade and the equity market will outperform developed and emerging market indices in the next five years, Lehman Brothers said today.																								In its report titled India: Everything to Play For, the global investment bank said the countrys rapid economic growth was not a flash in the pan, but many characteristics were similar to those in other Asian nations during their early stages of economic takeoff. These include rising incomes and an increasingly open economy.																								Lehman was also bullish on the rupee, which it said would appreciate significantly against the dollar. Another positive feature is that the growth is more structural than cyclical, with an investment boom and high productivity enhancing the economys capacity. 																								Gross domestic investment as a share of GDP increased to around 35 per cent in 2006-07 from 28 per cent in 2003-04, while gross domestic savings rose to 34 per cent from 29.7 per cent.																								India is also likely to attract substantial foreign investment and its local capital markets have enormous growth potential, the report said.																								Growth and structural reforms have started to interact in a dynamic manner even as consumption, exports and investment are feeding off one another. Moreover, improving fiscal finances and strong capital inflows are providing more resources for infrastructure spending.																								However, structural reforms will be critical for higher growth rates. Reforms such as easing of foreign direct investment rules and labour market deregulation will go a long way in sustaining higher growth in the medium term.

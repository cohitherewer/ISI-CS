				 Great debate on future
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct 9: Wheres the sensex headed? 																								Theres a confetti of numbers to choose from  and it depends on who you ask. Those who are brave or reckless enough to put forth a figure leave the time period deliciously vague. So, while CLSA says the sensex will sail past 40000 in the long term without spelling out how long that wait might be, local brokerages such as Motilal Oswal reckon it will stay in a conservative band of 16300 to 18300 in the medium term.																								ICICI direct, the broking arm of ICICI Securities, reckons the bellwether index will hit 22000 between December and March. The sensex targets may vary, but a large group of market pundits continues to take a bullish view that is predicated on an assumption of robust corporate earnings. 																								Analysts add that its not only the strong performance of domestic companies that could support the rally from here on. Interest rates have also peaked out and the Reserve Bank of India could in a couple of months, lower rates. 																								Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have shovelled $14.5 billion into Indian markets this year. Liquidity will continue to be strong. India is still under-invested from the FII perspective. Mature markets are highly invested and, when reallocation occurs towards emerging markets, money will flow into India, said Dhiraj Sachdev, vice-president and fund manager at HSBC Asset Management.																								Macquarie Research says two key risks have emerged in the past two months  a possible slowdown in US growth and early elections in 2008. However, it thinks India will be immune to a US slowdown given the more insular nature of the economy and the quirky nature of its software exports, which accelerate when the US economy slows. Pointing out that early elections are inevitable, probably in second quarter of 2008, the brokerage goes on to say that though this is likely to add to some near-term pressures, it will be neutral-to-positive for the long term.

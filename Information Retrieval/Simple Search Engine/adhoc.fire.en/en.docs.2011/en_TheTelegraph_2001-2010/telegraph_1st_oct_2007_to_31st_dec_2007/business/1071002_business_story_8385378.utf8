				 Airlines weigh fare hike
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 1: Air tickets are likely to rise by Rs 100, following a 4.5 per cent increase in prices of aviation turbine fuel. Hikes on this count are reflected in the surcharge component of fares.																								Sources said Jet Airways was weighing the possibility of increasing its surcharge by Rs 100 to Rs 1,200. However, Jet officials did not confirm the move. 																								Sources in Indian Airlines said it would, in all likelihood, follow suit. 																								Aviation fuel prices went up 4.2 per cent in Delhi to Rs 39,767 a kilolitre today on the back of global crude prices escalating to $82 a barrel. 																								Airlines had resorted to similar hikes last month. While Jet had increased fares by Rs 200 on all routes, Indian Airlines raised prices in the range of Rs 45-400.																								Marginal fare hikes caused by an increase in fuel costs have become routine now. Passengers have become more or less used to it, Indian Airlines officials said after last months hike.																								Prices of aviation turbine fuel, which make up 30-35 per cent of the operating cost of airlines, have been rising between 2 and 3 per cent for some time, forcing airlines to raise fares.

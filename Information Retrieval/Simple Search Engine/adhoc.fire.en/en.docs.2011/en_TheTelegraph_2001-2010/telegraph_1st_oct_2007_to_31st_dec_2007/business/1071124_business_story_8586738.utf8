				 BSNL to float fresh tender for GSM lines 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Goyal: New bid																								New Delhi, Nov. 23: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is planning to float a fresh tender for the 10 million GSM mobile lines that were earlier awarded to Nokia Siemens Networks.																								Nokia Siemens has refused to match Ericssons price of $91 per line. Tender conditions say that Nokia Siemens should match the price at which BSNL has awarded the contract to Swedish supplier Ericsson, which had emerged as the lowest bidder for BSNLs 22.75 million GSM lines. However, Nokia Siemens does not want to enter into a deal at $91 per line because it originally quoted $177 per line in its bid.																								We have started exploring other options for the 10 million GSM lines that Nokia Siemens was to provide  the possible alternatives include awarding this contract to Ericsson or floating a fresh tender, said Kuldeep Goyal, chairman and managing director of BSNL.																								Awarding the entire contract to Ericsson or going in for a fresh tender are the only options open to the PSU. This is because the other two companies in the fray  Motorola and China-based ZTE  were disqualified from the bidding process as they could not meet the stringent technical criteria laid down by BSNL in its tender. 																								At the same time, BSNL is set to float a fresh tender for about 60 million GSM lines. If we fail to reach a deal with Nokia Siemens, these 10 million lines can also be included in the 60 million line tender, added Goyal. 																								Calling card																								BSNL today launched an international calling card worth Rs 2,000 that allows users to call the US and Canada at Rs 1.75 per minute.																								While for some other destinations such as France, Russia, the UK and South East Asia, the rates would vary from Rs 3.25 to Rs 4 a minute, depending on the denomination value of CallNow cards, Goyal said.

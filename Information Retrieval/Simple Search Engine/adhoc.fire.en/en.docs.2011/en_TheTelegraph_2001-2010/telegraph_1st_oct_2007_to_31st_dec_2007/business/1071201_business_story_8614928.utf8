				 Reliance Energy to raise funds
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Power-driven																								Mumbai, Nov. 30: Anil Ambani is kicking off another fund-raising exercise.																								Reliance Energy (REL) is planning to raise resources through a preferential allotment of equity or other financial instruments, including long-term debt, to augment its resources.																								REL will pump the money into Reliance Power  the group company which is awaiting Sebis approval for its IPO  and finance various infrastructure projects.																								The REL board will meet on December 2 to finalise options for raising funds, the company informed stock exchanges today. 																								This is the second time in three years that REL is coming out with a preferential issue. 																								In March 2004, it made a preferential allotment of shares aggregating Rs 2,500 crore ($550 million) to the Reliance group, domestic institutions and foreign institutional investors.																								A few months back, Ambani had formed Reliance Power, which would be the groups primary vehicle in power generation. REL has a stake of around 50 per cent in Reliance Power.																								Market observers say if REL opts for a preferential issue and targets other investors, it should get a good response and rake in more money than it did in 2004. The promoters now hold 34.45 per cent, but it isnt clear whether they will pick up the preferential shares.																								The REL share has surged this year, reflecting the markets confidence in its business model and Ambanis plan to form a separate company for power generation. The scrip today closed at Rs 1,738.10 on the BSE, a gain of 4.47 per cent or Rs 74.40 over the last close.																								REL said in a statement that Reliance Power had been awarded a letter of intent for the 4,000MW imported-coal based power project at Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. The project will have an estimated capital outlay of Rs 20,000 crore.

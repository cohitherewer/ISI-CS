				 Govt lines up fertiliser sops
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan in New Delhi on Wednesday. Picture by Prem Singh																								New Delhi, Nov. 14: The government will issue Rs 7,500 crore of bonds this month to fertiliser companies for selling to farmers below the market price. The bonds will take the subsidy bill on fertilisers to Rs 47,000 crore this fiscal.																								There are also plans to move towards a nutrient-based subsidy scheme to reduce payouts in the long run and wean farmers away from the overuse of urea. 																								Of the Rs 47,000-crore fertiliser subsidy, about Rs 37,000 crore has been approved, while the remaining Rs 10,000 crore will be cleared in the second supplement, Union fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan said at the Economic Editors conference here today.																								The government has decided to offer bonds to fertiliser firms such as Iffco and Kribhco. The ministries of finance and fertilisers are discussing the terms of the proposed bond sale this month, fertiliser secretary J.S. Sarma said.																								In the nutrient-based subsidy policy, to be ready by the end of this year, relief will be given to more fertilisers, besides urea, diammonium phosphate and potash.																								Such a relief will increase the subsidy bill by Rs 1,200 crore in the first year, but in the long run the payout will decline.																								The government wants to make fertilisers having secondary and micro nutrients available to farmers at affordable prices. 																								The move is expected to lower the prices of nutrient-rich fertilisers. Because of subsidies, farmers are over-reliant on urea at the expense of secondary and micro nutrients.																								Paswan said all naphtha-based fertiliser plants would be converted to gas-based ones in three years.																								He said the government would give Rs 200 crore to the ailing Fertilizer amp; Chemicals of Travancore.																								Sarma said that from the next fiscal the subsidy would be linked to the availability of fertilisers at the block level.																								Currently, the subsidy is released according to fertilisers available at the district level.

				 Calcutta, Dec. 28: Oil India Ltd has drawn up a Rs 4,500-crore capital expenditure plan over the next two years to hike its domestic production capacity, chairman M.R. Pasrija said today.
																								He was speaking on the sidelines of a conference organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
																								The oil PSU had earlier this month filed the draft prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India for an initial public offering of 2.6 crore equity shares constituting 11 per cent of its post-issue paid-up capital. At present, the government holds a 98.17 stake in the company. Following the public issue, the stake will come down to 78.43 per cent. 
																								The government plans to divest another 10 per cent stake in the company to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation.
																								OIL, which is mainly engaged in the exploration, development, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, onshore, has recently been awarded four oil blocks in Libya. Following this, we shall have the largest number of oil blocks in the African country, Pasrija said. 
																								We are also going to sign a product sharing agreement with Sonatrack of Algeria, he added. The Algerian company, with a 50 per cent equity stake, will operate the four blocks in Libya. OIL has partnered the IOC and Sonatrack to bid for oil and gas blocks in other African countries such as Nigeria.

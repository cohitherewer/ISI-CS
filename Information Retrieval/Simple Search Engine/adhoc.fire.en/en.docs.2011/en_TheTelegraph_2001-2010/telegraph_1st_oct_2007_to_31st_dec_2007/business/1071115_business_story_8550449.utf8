				 IDBI gears up to raise $1.5bn
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 DOLLAR DREAMS 																								Mumbai, Nov. 14: The Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) today announced plans to raise $1.5 billion through a medium-term note (MTN) programme. 																								Several public sector banks had floated medium term notes on the overseas markets at the start of the year but the situation has become uncertain after the sub-prime crisis erupted in the US.																								The IDBI will be one of the first to test the waters after the upheaval in the global financial markets triggered by the US housing loan rumpus.																								With our new MTN programme in place, we will now be able to issue various debt instruments in the international capital markets, including senior notes, upper Tier II notes and hybrid Tier I notes, under a single documentation platform, said IDBI chairman and managing director Yogesh Agarwal in a statement. 																								MTNs are basically a clutch of bond offerings under one umbrella with an average maturity of five to seven years. 																								These notes could be used to prop up bank capital in various forms. 																								In January 2007, ICICI Bank had used this facility to raise $2 billion in dollar-denominated bonds. 																								Public sector major the State Bank of India had also raised close to $5 billion through this instrument in the past. 																								This is an enabling provision, we have filed an offer document and this document is valid for a year, said R.K. Bansal, chief financial officer of the IDBI. 																								The rate of interest and pricing will depend a lot on other factors, he added.																								The IDBI will use the money to provide loans from the overseas branches that it plans to establish.																								We have got the RBI approval to open overseas branches and are waiting for approvals from their respective monetary authorities. We plan to use this $1.5 billion to lend for various purposes via these overseas branches, Bansal added. 																								Indian banks are expected to raise $10 billion from the global bond markets in 2007, a little over double the $4.26 billion they raised in 2006.

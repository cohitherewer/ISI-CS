				 Birla firm eyes coal assets in Indonesia
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Ravi Kastia in Calcutta on Friday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Nov. 23: Essel Mining, which is part of the Aditya Vikram Birla group, is set to acquire coal assets in Indonesia.																								Ravi Kastia, managing director and chief executive officer of the company, said the company was looking for coal assets in Indonesia but did not elaborate.																								He was speaking to journalists on the sidelines of a three-day seminar organised by SteelRX and the Indian Chamber of Commerce.																								It is learnt that the company may acquire a coal block having deposits of about 50 million tonnes and the deal is expected in January.																								Going by present valuations, the block may cost Essel $200-250 million. It is likely that the company will go solo in this project. 																								Essels move comes only a few months after Tata Powers $1.1-billion acquisitions of 30 per cent stakes in two large Indonesian coal companies.																								Tata Powers move was aimed at ensuring fuel supply for its mega power project in Mundra. While Essel plans to ship the bulk of coal to India, the company is open to selling part of it to other countries such as Taiwan, Japan and China.																								Essel is one of Indias largest iron ore mining company in the non-captive segment. It has four mines at Barbil in Orissa producing about 7-7.5 million tonnes of high-quality ore.																								The company is diversifying into coal mining through an arrangement with Coal India Limited.																								Chiria policy 																								Kastia, who is also the chairman of the national committee on mining of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), strongly favoured policies that looked beyond the needs of captive users.																								The CII has made presentations to the government on the need to give access to Jharkhands Chiria mines to non-captive users.																								Such a move will benefit the steel sector, Kastia said.																								He said only 5 per cent of Indias land mass had been explored. I think we can find much more iron ore than what is believed today. That is the experience in Australia.

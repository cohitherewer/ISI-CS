				 Anil blasts GSM firms
																								New Delhi, Nov. 11 (PTI): Reliance ADAG chairman Anil Ambani has accused GSM operators of hoarding surplus spectrum and sought Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs intervention to ensure that service providers such as Vodafone and Bharti Airtel surrender excess airwaves.																								In a scathing attack on GSM players, who are demanding extra spectrum and have moved telecom tribunal TDSAT on new spectrum norms, Ambani said even sector regulator Trai, fair trade practices watchdog MRTPC and also the telecom tribunal have issued notices to Bharti and Vodafone for anti-consumer practices. 																								It is essential that the future of telecom industry is not undermined by a few with  narrow personal interests, Ambani said in a letter to Singh a few days before Diwali.																								The letter comes after GSM lobby Cellular Operators Association of India challenged the new policy of allowing dual technology for mobile telephony and new spectrum allocation norms as recommended by the Telecom Engineering Centre.

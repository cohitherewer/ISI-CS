																								The $ finally breaches Rs 40
																								With foreign exchange reserves cresting $272 billion, India has a larder of riches: an astonishing $100-billion increase in forex reserves in just 12 months signals just how robust the economy has become. Unlike other markets, interest rates in India have shown no signs of easing  and that means personal and housing loans will not become cheap anytime soon. The flipside is that this year has also seen bank deposits swell because rates rose in early May. However, by October, banks were trimming some of those rates ever so slightly. The rupee has also hardened by as much as 15 per cent against a weakening dollar. While this has made imports cheaper, exporting industries  especially the software industry  have seen their margins badly squeezed.

				 Honda gears up for hybrids 
 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE				 	 On new roads																								New Delhi, Oct. 12: Honda Motor is planning to launch gasoline-electric hybrid cars in India and has sought regulations from the government for such vehicles.																								If talks with the government succeed, Honda will be the first company to launch such cars in the country. A gasoline-electric engine increases fuel efficiency and mileage.																								A Honda spokesperson said, We already have hybrid cars in Japan, the US, the UK and some European countries. 																								She added, If Indian regulations permit gasoline-electric hybrid cars on Indian highways, we will import completely built units of gasoline-electric hybrid cars from Japan to India.																								Many countries offer tax sops to hybrid cars as they are considered environment friendly. However, Honda officials could not say whether the Indian government would consider similar sops. Toyota and General Motors are Hondas main competitors in the hybrid car market, which is growing into a niche segment worldwide. 																								Other vehicle makers, including Chinese truck companies, are plugging into the new technology. 																								In India, Honda does not have a facility to manufacture the cars. Honda sells petrol sedans such as the Accord and the Civic in the country. 																								Honda executives feel hybrids have a good future but may face a price resistance without subsidies as they cost more than cars powered by gasoline or diesel.																								A hybrid car runs on two or more sources of energy. It combines the best features of the internal combustion engine with an electric motor and can significantly improve fuel economy without sacrificing performance or driving range.																								The car market in India has been growing at a rate of 13 per cent. Till September this year, 833,042 passenger cars were sold compared with 738,294 in the same period last year.																								According to auto experts, hybrid cars will account for 3.5 per cent of the US market by 2010.

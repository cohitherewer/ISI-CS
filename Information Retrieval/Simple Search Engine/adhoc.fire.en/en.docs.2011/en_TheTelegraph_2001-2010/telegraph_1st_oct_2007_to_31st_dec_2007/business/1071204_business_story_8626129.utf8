				 Destination Bengal for two more 
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, Dec. 3: The Bengal government today signed two more agreements with private companies that would bring Rs 18,000 crore of investments in steel, power and cement.																								City-based Adhunik Corporation said it would set up a 1.1-million-tonne (mt) steel mill, a 1000-mega-watt (MW) power plant and a 1mt cement unit at Raghunathpur in Purulia at an estimated investment of Rs 7,200 crore.																								Another entity, Ranchis Abhijeet group, said it would invest Rs 10,800 crore in Burdwan. The group would set up a 2mt steel plant and a 1000MW power plant. 																								The agreements were signed at the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporations (WBIDC) office.																								WBIDC managing director M.V. Rao and the West Bengal Mineral Development amp; Trading Corporation managing director Arun Sen represented the government.																								The state, which does not have iron ore, ranks third in terms of proposed investments in steel, which are over Rs 100,000 crore. Trailing Orissa and Jharkhand, it has already surpassed mineral-rich Chattisgarh.																								Companies such as JSW Steel, Videocon and the Jai Balaji group are planning to invest in the state.																								Adhunik Corporation managing director Mahesh Agarwal said Bengal was an attractive destination for steel makers because of its coal reserves.																								Moreover, there is a ready market, infrastructure is good and the government is very supportive, Agarwal added.																								Steel investors seemed confident about getting land for the projects, despite the problems relating to acquisition. 																								Like Videocon, Adhunik wants to buy land directly from the owners with help from the government. It hopes to complete the acquisition in three to four months.																								Three gram panchayats have already accepted our offer. Prices are under negotiation, Agarwal said. 																								The company needs 2,300 acres.																								The Abhijeet group, however, will depend on the state administration to acquire 2,500 acres.																								Incidentally, JSW Steels Salboni plant is witnessing one of the fastest land acquisition in the country. The Rs 35,000-crore project may take off next month.																								Experts say assurances on coal availability are bringing steel companies to the state. The West Bengal Mineral Development and Trading Corporation has assured investors that it would recommend their cases to the Centre. Some of the blocks coming to the state will be provided to the firms.																								Adhunik and the Abhijeet group are hoping to bag a 600mt coal block at Ranigunj for their projects.																								For iron ore though, everyone except Adhunik are planning to buy fines from private miners.

				 Ministerial panel to vet fuel price
				 	 Singh: Action time																								On board PMs special aircraft, Nov. 20 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said a group of ministers (GoM) had been appointed to look into the fuel price issue.																								The cabinet did discuss this matter. I have appointed a GoM to report back to the cabinet within a month, he told reporters on his way to Singapore to attend a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.																								He, however, did not say when the cabinet discussed the issue and as to who would head the GoM. In New Delhi, a senior petroleum ministry official said the ministry had not received any communique on the appointment of a GoM. 																								In all probability it should be headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, the official said.																								Public sector oil firms the Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum are together losing over Rs 250 crore per day on the sale of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene as they have not been allowed to raise retail prices despite the rise in international oil rates.																								An industry official said a GoM had become necessary as there was no unanimity on raising fuel prices and the finance ministry was opposing the oil ministrys proposal to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel to ease the burden on oil firms.																								Petrol attracts an excise duty of 6 per cent plus Rs 13 a litre, while for diesel it is 6 per cent plus Rs 3.25 per litre. The petroleum ministry wanted excise duty to be lowered by Rs 1-2 a litre. The finance ministry has so far not favoured reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, arguing that there has been no increase in excise collections from the two fuels.																								However, the oil ministry says overall excise collections have gone up and the finance ministry should not take a sectoral view.

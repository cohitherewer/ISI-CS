																								Brussels, Nov. 28 (PTI) Indias trade with the European Union has increased manifold over the past decade especially in food and drinks, the statistical office of the European Commission has said.																								Ahead of the India-Europe summit on November 30 in New Delhi, the commission yesterday said statistics underscored the growing importance of the emerging Indian economy in the world food trade and the overall trade with Europe, which has grown by 80 per cent since 2000.																								Products manufactured in India often come at a lower cost, piling pressure on European companies to cut their prices, thereby increasing competition, the report said. At the same time, Indian consumers have increasingly adapted to westernised diet trends, fuelling the need for trade.																								Figures released by Euromonitor showed that the value of the ready-to-eat meals market in India had grown from $3.7 million in 2002 to $22.2 million.																								Europe exported food and drink products worth 57 million euros to India in 2000. This increased five-fold to 263 million euros in 2006. Imports from India have grown at a lesser pace, from 1,207 million euros to 1471 million euros over the six-year period.																								Germany is the largest exporter, making up 26 per cent of the total exports to India, with a value of 6.3 billion euros. It was followed by Belgium with 19 per cent and the United Kingdom with 16 per cent. The UK is the largest importer, with a value of 4.5 billion euros.

																								Calcutta, Dec. 27: Chevron, the $200-billion US energy powerhouse, plans to open its door to more Indians.
																								Jeet S. Bindra, president of Chevron Global Refining, said the company, for the first time , would recruit scientists from two IITs  Kanpur and Chennai  next year.
																								Globally, Chevron will recruit some 6,000 scientists next year, including those from the IITs.
																								Not all of them will be chemical scientists. It will be a mixed bag, Bindra said.
																								Bindra himself is an alumnus of IIT Kanpur. He rose through the ranks of Chevron to head the global refining operations of the company.
																								This is the most exciting time to be in the energy industry, Bindra said, while urging young professionals to take up the challenges in this sector.
																								Bindra was speaking today on the sidelines of Chemcon 2007, the annual event of the Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers, being held in Calcutta.
																								Bindra, however, declined to comment on any of Chevrons businesses in India.
																								The company has a 5 per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum, with an option to raise it to 29 per cent. There have been reports of Chevron looking at exiting Reliance Petroleum.
																								Chevrons Indian operations started in 1930. Today it employs 320 people in the country, mainly in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.
																								Under the Chevron brand name, the company is involved in lubricant blending and marketing, and importing, bottling and marketing of liquefied petroleum gas, among others.
																								Early this year, Chevron set up an executive business development office in New Delhi to pursue a range of opportunities. 
																								It is also exploring the possibility of investing in Indias exploration and production sector.

				 Hint of single telecom fee
 JAYATI GHOSE																								New Delhi, Oct. 2: The department of telecom wants to introduce a single fee for all operators. 																								The move, if accepted by the cabinet, could see a drop in telephone tariff and lower the payout burden on telecom companies. The department now charges various fees.																								This has been suggested by the committee set up by the department of telecom (DoT) to review tax and levies in the industry. The panel will submit its report next week, which will be sent to the finance ministry for consideration, said officials. 																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram, who had proposed the single levy system, had asked the DoT to set up a committee to study the structure of levies and make suitable recommendations to the government.																								However, DoT officials said the system of a single levy could take up to two years to be introduced. 																								According to officials, the panel will suggest a three- phase structure to simplify the multiple levies. In the first phase, various levies, including the licence fee and spectrum charges, will be clubbed into a single central levy.																								Eventually, all other fees, including the universal services obligation fund, will be removed and replaced with a single levy system, said officials. 																								Telecom operators have been lobbying for a single unified levy as it will result in a cut in tariffs. 																								Officials said the tax structure should be rationalised and the committee had suggested certain steps. 																								At present, telecom operators pay up to 30 per cent of their revenues as levies and taxes, which are among the highest in the world. 																								Operators in other developing countries pay less than 5 per cent, while telecom firms in China pay 3 per cent. 																								In India, service tax makes up 12 per cent of the total pay-out by a telecom firm. Licence fees constitute another 10 per cent, and nearly 4 per cent is spent on spectrum charges. Besides, the states impose additional taxes such as octroi, VAT, stamp duty, entry tax and levies on towers.

				 Infotech wants special cell to tackle dollar deluge
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Nov. 29: The IT industry wants the Centre to set up a special body to manage the dollar deluge that is playing havoc with the bottomlines of the industry.																								According to B. Ramalinga Raju, chairman and managing director of Satyam Computer Services Ltd, this body should manage both the outflow and inflow of dollars.																								He was speaking at Infocom 2007, organised by Businessworld, of the ABP group, and Germanys CeBIT. Infocom 2007 is Indias premier IT conference and exhibition event.																								The continuous and rather rapid weakening of the dollar has impacted the IT industry. Without the government intervention, the country will lose out on opportunities and other countries will take advantage of it, Raju said. 																								Inaugurating the four-day meet, Bengal IT minister Debesh Das said the Bengal government had sought an extension of the software technology park scheme till 2020. The central scheme, which is valid till 2012, offers relief to IT companies and is the bedrock of Indias success story in IT.																								Raju said there were concerns over infrastructure and human resources. Though some state governments have taken proactive steps to address these issues, it is not sufficient. It has to be taken up at the national level. Industry revenues were $100 million in 1991 and are expected to touch $100 billion in 2010.																								With more and more services being delivered through the Internet, the size of the industry can touch trillion dollars by 2020, Raju said.																								He said India companies were poised to cash in on the opportunities in the global service sector. Unlike global majors, who are caught in legacy issues, Indian firms are ready to accept change and they can create knowledge in a demystified and innovative manner. If we can commoditise excellence, we will be able to service the needs of the entire world. 																								In his inaugural address, D.D. Purkayastha, CEO of ABP Pvt Ltd and the organising secretary of Infocom 2007, said the meet was a powerful platform for the IT and telecommunications industries.																								Previously, the meet was held in Calcutta, but being a premier IT event it was important that it moved out of eastern India and Hyderabad was the obvious choice, Purkayastha said.																								Andhra Pradesh governor Narayan Dutt Tiwari felicitated the winners of the Infocm Future Leadership Award 2007. 																								He also inaugurated the exhibition at the HITEX grounds. There are 170 participants from India, China, Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Australia and the Southeast Asian countries.

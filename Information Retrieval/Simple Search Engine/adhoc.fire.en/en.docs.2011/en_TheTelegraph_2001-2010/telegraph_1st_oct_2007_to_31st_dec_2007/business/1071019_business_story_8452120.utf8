				 Reliance net profit beats estimates
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTMumbai, Oct 18: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) stunned the market once again with a better-than-expected net profit of Rs 3,837 crore in the second quarter ended September 30, almost 13 per cent higher than the analysts consensus estimate of Rs 3,400 crore.																								The performance was underpinned by robust refining margins and lower interest payout. RIL, which has been consistently delivering better gross refining margins than estimates for the past few quarters, declared a margin of $13.6 per barrel in the quarter. 																								Although this was lower than the $15.4 per barrel in the preceding quarter, it was above street estimates of around $12 per barrel. Gross refining margin is the difference between value of petroleum products produced and the price of crude oil.																								RILs first quarter numbers, which were restated to include IPCL, saw a net profit of Rs 3,837 crore, a growth of 28 per cent over Rs 3,000 crore in the same period last year. 																								The turnover of the company during the period shot up to Rs 33,402 crore from Rs 31,422 crore, a rise of 6 per cent. Turnover for the half year period ended September 30 was Rs 64,692 crore, reflecting a growth of 9 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year. 																								Revenues surged because of the 5 per cent increase in prices and 4 per cent growth in volumes. During the period under review, exports were 11 per cent higher at Rs 37,074 crore.																								RIL said the net operating margin for the period was higher at 18.6 per cent compared with 17.3 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. 																								During the six-month period, other income was higher at Rs 365 crore against Rs 233 crore because of increase in interest income on higher surplus funds. Interest costs for the six-month period were lower by 7 per cent at Rs 552 crore on account of appreciation of the rupee against the dollar.																								Mukesh D. Ambani, chairman and managing director of RIL, said, Reliance had another quarter of record earnings. Once again, our world class assets have delivered a superior operating performance.																								Further, Reliance has extended its global footprint with the acquisition of Gapco in East Africa and Hualons assets in Malaysia. Our investments in exploration and production, organised retail and development of special economic zones will all be the cornerstones for future growth, Ambani added.																								Refinery margins were higher because of efficiency in several parameters that included sourcing crude oil both in terms of geography and quality.

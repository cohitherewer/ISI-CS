				 L amp;T floats outfit to power ahead

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
				 	 Naik: Big plans
																								Mumbai, Dec. 21: Larsen and Toubro (L amp;T) has floated a power generation firm called L amp;T Power Development and will invest Rs 20,000 crore in the company.
																								The overall investment in the company will be Rs 20,000 crore. L amp;T will invest Rs 5,000 crore and the rest will come through debt, L amp;T chairman and managing director A. M. Naik said during the companys 70th-year-celebration ceremony. This year is also the birth centenary of L amp;Ts co-founder Henning Holck-Larsen. 
																								The new firm will generate 5,000MW of power in the next five years.
																								L amp;T is present in the sector through L amp;T Power Projects Ltd which is into engineering, procurement and construction activities. L amp;T Power builds plants on a turnkey basis. L amp;T also has a 51 per cent stake in the 150MW HPL Cogeneration Ltd, an investment it made more than 10 years ago. Haldia Petrochemicals holds 49 per cent in HPL Cogeneration. 
																								The company said it would opt for Gujarat for its second ship building facility if it failed to procure land at Kattupalli, Tamil Nadu. The company had made its foray into ship building last year. Its existing shipyard is at Hazira, Gujarat. The company has bagged an order from the Netherlands-based Rolldock to build four heavy lift semi-submersible cargo ships.
																								L amp;T is planning to set up the countrys biggest shipbuilding facility, which will require around 1200 acres. The shipyard will build large crude carriers having capacities of around 4000 dead weight tonnage.
																								Our proposal in Tamil Nadu went to the chief ministers committee, but it has got caught up in the land debate there even as the proposed site is not agricultural land. If there is no development in Tamil Nadu by January, we will look at other sites, such as near the Mundra port. We have set January as our deadline, said Naik. He said the company had also considered Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh for the shipyard project. 
																								If land was available in the Kakinada port region, the company would have headed there straightaway, Naik added. The second shipyard will have a ship repairing and floating production system. It will also have a facility to build ships for the navy. 
																								L amp;T has also bid for building a port in Gujarat, but the evaluation process has been held up because of the Assembly elections in the state.

				 Paswan tilts towards ore export ban
 SAMBIT SAHA				 	 Paswan: Strong stand																								Calcutta, Nov. 11: The steel ministry is in favour of a ban on iron ore export.																								Ram Vilas Paswan, the steel minister, said exports were an option only after ensuring sufficient reserves for domestic steel manufacturers.																								He said exports were possible after meeting the needs of steel for the next 40 years.																								According to us, India has 25 billion tonnes of iron ore reserves. All of that will be required for the next 40 years, Paswan told The Telegraph.																								He said the country could think of exports if there were more hidden reserves. If people find more, which to my mind is unlikely, one can think of export. 																								Paswans remark lends voice to Indian steel companies call for the ban on export.																								Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is also in favour of the ban after Jharkhand refused to give ore to the Jindals for their Bengal project.																								A steel company executive said though Indias ore reserves at 24 billion tonnes were high, a limited amount was available to industry.																								This is because proven reserves are only about 6 billion tonnes, the rest being possible reserves.																								Of the two ore grades, magnetite and hematite, there are about 11 billion tonnes of the latter. They are mostly found in regions of Karnataka and Goa that are ecologically sensitive.																								The executive said that this showed reserves available to steel was for even less than 40 years.																								Indian steel companies say consumption is ready to take off. 																								According to latest estimates, production will go up to 200 million tonnes (mt) by 2020 from around 50 mt this year.																								In per capita terms, Indias consumption is 21 tonnes, compared with 333 tonnes of Brazil, 389 tonnes of Russia and 2,000 tonnes of Australia.

				 Infinite stake in Shrachi twins
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 5: Real estate private equity company Infinite India is investing Rs 200 crore in two Shrachi realty firms.																								Infinite, a joint venture between JM Financial and the US-based SRS, will buy stakes in Shrachi Developers Pvt Ltd and Shrachi Realty Pvt Ltd for Rs 50 crore each. 																								The rest of the sum will go into various projects over the next three years.																								We are excited about the opportunity in the realty market of eastern India. This is Infinites largest transaction so far, chairman Karthik R. Sarma said.																								After the firm picks up the stakes, Sarma and Vishal Kampani  director of Infinite and son of Nimesh Kampani, chairman of the JM Financial group  will join the two Shrachi firms.																								Shrachi Developers managing director Rahul Todi declined to reveal the details of the stake Infinite would hold in the company. 																								He, however, said fresh equities were being issued to further capitalise the company.																								Our family, the promoters of Shrachi, is not selling stakes. We brought them to strengthen the company, so that it can take up more projects in the future, Todi said.																								Shrachi Developers is the holding company for Shrachi Realty and Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltd, a joint venture with the West Bengal Housing Board.																								Shrachi Developers will henceforth take up smaller standalone residential, commercial and retail projects.																								Shrachi Realty will venture into FDI-compliant large-scale townships and SEZs.

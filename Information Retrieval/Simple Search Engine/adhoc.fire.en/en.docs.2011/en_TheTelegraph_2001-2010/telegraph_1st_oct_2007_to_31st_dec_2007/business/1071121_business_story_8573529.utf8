				 Sub-prime fear pulls down stocks
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Nov. 20: The sensex tottered for the fourth consecutive day as the markets around the world were rattled by fresh concerns over the US sub-prime crisis.																								The 30-share benchmark index swooned by almost 353 points to end the day at 19280.80. 																								After opening weak at 19510.94 in the morning, the market started reacting to negative signals from other Asian markets and eventually witnessed a huge profit-booking during the last one hour of trading. 																								The nifty lost 2.15 per cent at 5780.90 even as all Asian markets went into the red today amid growing worries enveloping investments in securities tied to the US sub-prime mortgage. 																								On Tuesday, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones slumped almost 1.7 per cent while the S amp;P lost about 1.8 per cent on its stocks. 																								Barring the smallcap stocks, almost all the benchmark indices were weak throughout the session. The mid-cap index and the BSE-100 fell by almost 105 and 203 points, respectively. 																								Among sectoral indices, power and PSU stocks recorded the highest losses at over 3 per cent each. Realty shares declined by 2.95 per cent, while oil and gas stocks fell by 2.65 per cent. 																								While expecting more volatility, the market experts said only a positive announcement by the Federal Bank in the US could give fresh impetus to Asian stocks. The Fed is due to make an announcement later in the evening. 																								Todays fall is pretty surprising as the market saw a sudden reversal during the last trading hour. The fall can be attributed to the huge profit-booking that was driven by weak global cues. As there has been considerable buying across all Asian equities today, the Indian investors have only reacted to global cues, which includes the US sub-prime mortgage crisis, Hitesh Agrawal, vice-president (research) at Angel Broking told The Telegraph.

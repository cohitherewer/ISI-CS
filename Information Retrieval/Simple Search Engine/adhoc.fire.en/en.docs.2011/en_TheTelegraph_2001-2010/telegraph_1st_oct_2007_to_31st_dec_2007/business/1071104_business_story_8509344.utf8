				 	 Prince: Exit mode																								New York, Nov. 3 (Reuters): When Charles Prince replaced Sanford Sandy Weill at the helm of Citigroup Inc, he was given the unenviable task of replacing a legend. Shareholders feared he could never fill Weills shoes. They may soon be proven right.																								The end of a tumultuous four-year reign at the largest US bank by assets appears at hand for the 57-year-old native Californian, expected to resign at an emergency board meeting on Sunday according to the Wall Street Journal.																								Prince will become the second prominent chief executive on Wall Street to lose his job after this summers credit market collapse, which led Citigroup to a $6.5-billion write-down and a 57 per cent decline in quarterly profit.																								Merrill Lynch on Tuesday ousted its chief Stanley Neal after a $8.4-billion write-down.																								Like Merrill, Citigroup ventured far into risky forms of debt and leveraged lending. Prince took much heat for July 9 comments that the bank was still dancing in private equity, just as it appeared to many that the music was about to stop.																								It has been a long and tiring time for Citigroup stock investors, said Thomas Russo, a long time Citigroup investor who helps invest $3 billion at Gardner, Russo amp; Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 																								Prince had told investors this would be the year of no excuses. It unfolded into a year of lots of excuses, Russo added.

				 Falcon plans to widen range
 SAMBIT SAHA				 	 New avenues																								Mysore, Sept. 30: Falcon Tyres, the market leader in two and three-wheeler segments, is planning a diversification exercise, for which it will double production capacities.																								Pawan K. Ruia, chairman of the company, said Falcon might get into industrial products and off-the-road tyres.																								We are working on the plan and it should be finalised in two months, Ruia told the media here after holding the annual general meeting of the company in Bangalore.																								For this purpose, Falcon is exploring the possibility of setting up a facility in either Himachal Pradesh or Uttaranchal, which offers tax breaks.																								Ruia is not ruling out the possibility of adding capacity by expanding the Mysore plant, provided Falcon acquires a good chunk of contiguous land.																								The company is expanding its tyre capacity to 7.5 lakh tonnes from 5.5 lakh tonnes and that of tube production to 375,000 tonnes from 250,000 tonnes. 																								Overall, it will make 110 tonnes of rubber products a day. The new lines will come into production in a couple of months.																								While the companys gross sales touched Rs 321 crore last fiscal from Rs 255.6 crore in 2005-6, profit went up marginally to Rs 3.96 crore from Rs 3.62 crore. Falcon has a subsidiary in Maharashtra, Monatona Tyres.																								We cannot operate with such low margins. To improve profitability we have to get into new products, Ruia said.																								The company is also setting up a 6MW co-generation plant using steam, which will be operational by the end of this year. This will lower power costs to Rs 2.25 a unit from Rs 4.70. Benefits of the expansion programme and lower power costs will impact the bottomline from the fourth quarter of this fiscal. 																								For off-the-road tyres, associate company Dunlop will market the products. Such tyres will also use the Dunlop name.																								For two and three-wheeler tyres, Falcon markets the products but uses the Dunlop name. In industrial products, such as conveyor belts, the marketing will be done by another company in the Ruia stable, Indian Tyre amp; Rubber.																								The company is trying to increase retail sales where margins are higher compared with sales to automobile companies. 																								The plan is to reduce the share of the companies to less than 50 per cent.																								Falcon has also inked an agreement with Japans Sumitomo to make tubeless tyres.																								Dunlop output																								Ruia said the Dunlop plants at Sahagunj in Bengal and Ambattur near Chennai would each attain a daily capacity of 130 tonnes by the end of this year. 																								Sahagunj is producing 50 tonnes daily and will touch 90 tonnes by the end of October.

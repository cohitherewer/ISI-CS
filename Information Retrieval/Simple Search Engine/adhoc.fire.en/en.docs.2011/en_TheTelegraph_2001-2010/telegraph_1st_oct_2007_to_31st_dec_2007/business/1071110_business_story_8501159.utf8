				 Khaitans eye growth through buyouts
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Khaitan: Acquisition mode																								Calcutta, Nov. 9: The BM Khaitan group is on the prowl for acquisitions to take its turnover to Rs 2,000 crore by 2010.																								The group is looking at acquisitions for four of its companies, including flagship Eveready Industries, McLeod Russel India and McNally Bharat. 																								Going ahead, we want 50 per cent of our turnover to come from the non-battery business. All our companies are in a comfortable position and we feel that in order to give them that additional spur, inorganic growth would be one of the options, said Deepak Khaitan, vice-chairman and managing director, Eveready Industries India Ltd.																								The group is looking at two acquisitions for Eveready.																								Khaitan said Eveready wanted to become the third largest player in the Indian packet tea business after Tata Tea and Hindustan Unilever. The target would be to double our 8000-tonne packet tea business by volume for which we need inorganic growth. 																								Eveready has four brands  Teez, Jago, Premium Gold and Classic  and is planning to acquire local brands in UP, Gujarat and Maharashtra that have a strong local presence but are having trouble going national.																								Eveready is also looking for a non-battery, non-tea FMCG brand that would compliment its portfolio of batteries, packet tea, mosquito coils, CFL lamps and dish washing cakes.																								Khaitan is willing to look abroad for a suitable brand and if it fails to find one it will invest in existing ones.																								McLeod Russel, the groups tea plantation company, expects to start the next season with record prices of Rs 99 per kg.																								McLeod Russel is on the lookout for gardens in India and Kenya.																								McNally Bharat Engineering Company Ltd, the engineering company of the group, is also looking at acquisitions. 																								The companys areas of operations include mining, water management and sewage projects.																								McNally has been reporting growth rates of 50 per cent. If the trend persists, it will become a Rs 1,000-crore company from a Rs 700-crore one.

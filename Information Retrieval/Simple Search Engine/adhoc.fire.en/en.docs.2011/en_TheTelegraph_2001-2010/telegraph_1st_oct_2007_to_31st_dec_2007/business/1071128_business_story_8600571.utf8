				 RBI warns banks of market risk
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 CHAIN REACTION																								Mumbai, Nov. 27: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today warned that banks could be exposed to some degree of market risk in the near term which could have an adverse impact on their balancesheets through an increase in loan losses.																								In its Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2006-07, the central bank said the source of such a risk was the financial markets. Though global financial imbalances have eased since the US sub-prime crisis has come to light, any adverse adjustments in the financial markets may have implications for the banking sector through changes in interest rates and shifts in liquidity. 																								While a sharp rise in interest rates because of low liquidity may result in marked-to-market losses on the investment portfolio of banks, a surge in interest rates could also have some impact on households leading to an increase in loan losses for banks (borrowers not repaying loans), the RBI warned.																								Banks in India have only modest direct and indirect exposure to the equity market. In case of a decline in equity market, some of the advances extended by banks for investment in the equity market may be impaired, it added.																								Of the two major sources of risk faced by banks  credit risk and market risk  banks will continue to face a benign credit risk environment in the near future. 																								Although the macroeconomic outlook in the near future remains favourable and can have a positive impact on the credit risk environment, the RBI felt that rapid credit growth in the past three years may lead to higher slippages of non-performing assets (NPAs) in the loan portfolio of banks.																								In fact, the trend of higher NPAs may already have begun. The report said during 2006-07, the gross NPAs of new private sector banks, foreign banks and the State Bank group have showed an increase over the previous year.

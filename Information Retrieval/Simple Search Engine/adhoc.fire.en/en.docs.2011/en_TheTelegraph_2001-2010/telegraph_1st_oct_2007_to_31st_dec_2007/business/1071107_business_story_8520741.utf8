Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha																								New Delhi, Nov. 6: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) today said it planned to buy stakes in two oil blocks in Sudan, where it has the largest presence outside India.																								Sudans oil minister Awad Ahmed al-Jaz said, Besides the three blocks ONGC already has in Sudan, it has shown interest in two more blocks. The doors are open for Indian investment in Sudan. 																								He was speaking to reporters after a meeting with petroleum minister Murli Deora on the sidelines of a conference on oil and gas between India and Africa.																								In one block, called Block 8, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas arm of ONGC, has sought to purchase 30 per cent of the 85 per cent stake held by Petronas of Malaysia, which is the main operator.																								In the other block, called Block B, OVL is keen on a 32.5 per cent stake, which is yet to be allocated by the Sudan government. Frances Total SA, with about 31-32 per cent stake, is the main operator of Block B, in which the UKs White Nile is also a partner. 																								At the conference, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said the country needed to expand its primary energy supply by three to four times and electricity generation by five to six times in the next 25 years to sustain high growth rates.																								The task of investing in overseas energy assets has, therefore, become an important aspect of our economic diplomacy, he said.																								Deora said India was keen on collaborative relationships with African countries, under which India, besides investment support, will offer its expertise in technology, training and research and development.																								At the two-day conference there are representatives from 25 African countries.

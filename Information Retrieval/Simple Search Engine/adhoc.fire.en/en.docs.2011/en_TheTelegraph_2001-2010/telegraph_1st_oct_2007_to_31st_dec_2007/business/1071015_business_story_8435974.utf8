 Q amp;A				 Sale of MF units
																																																																																													 I invested some money in UTI Infrastructure Fund on December 12 last year. I want to sell those units now. Do I have to pay short-term capital gains tax? If so, what do the provisions under section 10(23D) and 10(35) mean? What would be the tax treatment if I hold the units for more than 12 months? Would the treatment be different from shares?																																																																													Sudip Dutta, Asansol
																																																																																													You will have to pay short-term capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent if you sell those units before December 11, 2007. The provisions u/s 10(23D) and 10(35) are for mutual funds and not for unit-holders. The income of unit-holders by way of sale or transfer of units is exempted from long-term capital gains tax under section 10(38). However, this exemption is applicable only in case of equity schemes and not on debt-oriented schemes. So, if you sell those units after December 11, you wont have to pay any capital gains tax as in the case of any investment in shares.																																					PAN procedure																																																																																															 I am more than 70 years of age and my income from interest on savings is below the taxable limit. Is it obligatory to have a PAN? What is the procedure and cost to get a PAN card?																																																																													M. Banerjee, Behala
																																																																																													The government is making PAN mandatory for investment in mutual funds and shares, bank deposits of more than Rs 50,000 and cash transaction above Rs 25,000. Holding a PAN doesnt mean you will have to submit income tax return regularly. UTI Technology Services is the authorised agency to provide all PAN-related services. You can apply online for a PAN through UTITSLs website www.utitsl.co.in and pay the fee through a credit card or demand draft. The cost of the application form (49A) is Rs 5 and UTITSL takes a service charge of Rs 60.																																					Tax limit																																																																																															 I am a 53-year-old woman. I get Rs 1,60,000 per annum as income from a single branch of a bank. I invest Rs 35,000 in provident fund. Can I submit Form 15G to the bank for non-deduction of tax on the interest income? Do I have to pay tax?																																																																													Mrs Sinha, Shyamnagar
																																																																																													The basic income limit for tax exemption for women is Rs 1,45,000 from the current fiscal. Your annual income is higher than the limit. So you will have to pay tax. Since you have a tax liability, you cannot claim non-deduction of tax at source on your interest income by submitting Form 15G.

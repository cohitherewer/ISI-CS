				 UBS calls off StanChart deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
				 	 Stop signal
																								Mumbai, Dec. 28: UBS today called off the acquisition of Standard Chartered Banks mutual funds business in India as the deal could not secure approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
																								In an official announcement, the Switzerland-based financial services group said that following the expiry of the sale and purchase agreement that it executed in January this year with Standard Chartered Bank, both the entities have decided not to continue negotiations regarding the acquisition of Standard Chartereds mutual funds management business in India.
																								In January, UBS said that subject to regulatory approvals, it would buy the British banks mutual funds business for around $118 million.
																								UBS added that a strategic alliance between the two for fund distribution in Asia, announced at the same time as the planned acquisition, would be unaffected by this development. Reiterating its commitment to India, UBS said it would continue to provide its clients in India with equity brokerage and advisory services through UBS India Securities Pvt Ltd. 
																								Any costs accruing to UBS through abandonment of the planned transaction will be negligible and will have no material impact on UBSs earnings, it further noted.
																								Though the precise reasons for the central bank not giving its approval for the proposed acquisition is not known, reports said that it violated restrictions on the transfer of shares in a non-banking finance company.

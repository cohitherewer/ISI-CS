				 Stocks not amused
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, Oct. 30: The sensex today tumbled 194.16 points to settle at 19783.51 after yesterdays record climb. 																								Investors booked profit throughout the session, spooked by the CRR hike in RBIs mid-term credit policy review. Interest-sensitive sectors such as banking and auto were the worst affected.																								After the RBI increased banks reserve requirements, raising concerns that loan growth and consumer demand would slow, almost all the major benchmark indices turned red. The sensex was see-sawing between 20238.16 and 19694.85 points during the day before finally sliding down by 0.97 per cent. 																								Auto scrips slumped 3.12 per cent. Bank stocks also put up a poor show, and the banking index fell 99.62 points. 																								The State Bank of India lost 2.6 per cent, while ICICI Bank plunged 0.73 per cent to Rs 1,240.25 on the BSE.																								Auto shares fell on concerns of lower vehicle sales if banks had less money to lend. Nearly all commercial vehicles and more than 80 per cent of passenger vehicles were bought with loans and through finance options. 																								Maruti Suzuki fell 8.5 per cent and Tata Motors dropped 4.9 per cent. 																								Top tractor and utility vehicle maker Mahindra amp; Mahindra lost 7 per cent. 																								The CRR hike alone is not responsible. We expect some more profit-booking during the week, and this would induce volatility. There is also a jittery feeling among investors over the upcoming review by the US Fed, said Amitabh Chakraborty of Religare. If the Fed rate cut is around 25 per cent the market should react positively.

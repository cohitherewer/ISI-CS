				 RIL to open cash tap for oil
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 FUND FROLIC				 																								New Delhi, Nov. 29: Reliance Industries today said it would invest Rs 17,000 crore in oil and gas exploration and may surrender seven blocks to the government.																								Reliance vice-president E.V. Rao said the company would invest Rs 9,000 crore as risk capital over the next two years and another Rs 8,000 crore to meet a minimum work commitment at its blocks.																								Speaking at an oil industry meet, Rao said the company had already invested Rs 9,000 crore in deep water oil exploration.																								Eighty-two per cent of Reliances oil and gas acreage in the country lies in deep water, where exploration costs are three times costlier compared with onshore exploration. 																								Rao said the company was exploring the possibility of surrendering seven oil and gas blocks to the government.																								The company has so far handed back 11 blocks as they are not viable.																								Reliance aims to supply gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin within a year.																								ONGC find																								The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) today said it had found more gas at a block in Rajasthan. The block was awarded to ONGC before the auction system which started eight years ago. 																								ONGC did not disclose the possible reserve in the block or the estimated rate of production of gas. 																								We have tested one zone and the second zone is under testing ... We will know the potential reserves in the block in two to three weeks, D.K. Pande, the companys exploration director, said.																								Officials said ONGC had turned down an equity swap offer from Norsk Hydro of Norway.																								Norsk offered stakes in Iranian and Angolan oil blocks for equity in Krishna-Godavari blocks of ONGC.																								Norsk brought to us two blocks for participation but we didnt find the blocks too exciting. We have decided against taking a stake in any of the two blocks, a senior ONGC official said.																								City gas bids																								Despite facing constraints in regulating the natural gas sector, the government will invite bids for gas distribution projects in 200 cities by the middle of January, the chairman of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, L. Mansingh, said here today.																								He said unless the government issued a notification on bringing natural gas under the purview of the board, it was not possible to regulate the sector.

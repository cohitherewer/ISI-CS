 Q amp;A				 Coming home
																																																																																													 My son is working in the UK for more than 10 years. Now he plans to return to India for good. He has an NRE fixed deposit with a bank here. Will the status of the NRE fixed deposit change on his return to the country? He will also get some of his earnings in pounds even after he returns. Will this attract income tax?																																																																													J. Chowdhury, Calcutta
																																																																																													According to the Exchange Control Manual, the NRE account should be redesignated as resident rupee accounts or as resident foreign currency accounts by account holders immediately after their return to India if they decide to stay on in the country. If the account holder is only on a short visit to India, the account may continue to be treated as an NRE account even during his stay here. For funds held in fixed deposits in NRE accounts, interest will be payable at the rate originally fixed, provided the deposit is held for the full term even after its conversion into a resident account. If income tax is deducted from your sons earnings abroad he wont need to pay income tax here even if he receives the amount in India.																																					Cheque endorsement																																																																																															 I would like to issue a cheque to a person who doesnt have a bank account. Can he endorse the cheque to another person who has a back account? 																																																																													Samar Roy, Calcutta
																																																																																													A cheque is a negotiable instrument. One can endorse a cheque in another persons name by filling up a bank endorsement form, providing account details of the person he wants the money to be transferred to and also by writing on the cheque. He may have to provide some identity proof of his own. 																																					Tax queries																																																																																															 I am a senior citizen. Which income tax return form should I use? Is the total interest income from PPF account tax-free? Are dividends tax-free for me?																																																																													Kamal K. Guha, Calcutta
																																																																																													The form you will use will depend on the sources of your income. If you have income from pension and interest from bank/post office deposits, you will have to use ITR-1. But if you have income from house rent or dividend income from shares or mutual funds, you will have to use ITR-2. Only dividends from mutual fund schemes are tax-free. 												If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700001.

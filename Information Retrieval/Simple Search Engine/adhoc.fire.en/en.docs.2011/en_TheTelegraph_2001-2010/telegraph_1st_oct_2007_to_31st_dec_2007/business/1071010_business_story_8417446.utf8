				 Eight steps to eighteen
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Sensex betters its own single-day record																								Mumbai, Oct. 9: The sensex roared past 18000 today  rising another 1000 points in an eight-day blitz.																								Market mavens said there were two new reasons for the rally: first, the scare of an early election seemed to recede after reports that the UPA and Left leaders would meet again on October 22 to break a stalemate; and second, the buzz on the Street that Reliance Industries would make a bold announcement  either a stock split or a bonus  at the annual general meeting on Friday.																								The third factor  the deluge of dollars  provided a sustained ballast to the rally as the bellwether index rose 789 points, the largest single-day gain, to close at 18280.24. The 4.5 per cent gain over Mondays close puts another Rs 2,12,656 crore into investors wallets.																								The largest single-day gain before today was on September 19, when the sensex jumped 653.63 points to 16322.75. 																								It was also the day that the sensex oscillated a 1000 points between the days low and its high as overseas investors sparked a buying frenzy in equities led by Reliance Industries. Foreign institutional investors have pumped more than $3.5 billion since September 26 when the index hit 17000.																								After opening at 17402.24 and hitting the days low of 17287.19, the index surged to a record high of 18327.42. 																								While scaling 18000, the sensex recorded its second fastest 1000-point journey. Just last month, it leapt from 16000 to 17000 in six days.																								The sharp upward movement came after the news that the UPA-Left committee will meet again. This led to a feeling in the market that the problems over the nuclear deal with the US will be sorted out and that the Left will not withdraw support immediately, Seshadri Bharathan, director (stockbroking) at Dawnay Day AV Securities, told The Telegraph.																								For the markets which recovered after a 282-point fall on Monday, a flow of good news from New Delhi is crucial as it waits for the start of the second-quarter earnings season that begins on Thursday when IT giant Infosys announces its results. Many analysts expect corporate India to report a robust set of numbers though local brokerage Motilal Oswal has predicted the worst profit growth in the last seven quarters.																								Harendar Kumar, head of research at ICICI direct, said todays climb was led by the markets sherpas  the Reliance pack. Brokers here said rumours of a stock split and a bonus ignited the RIL scrip which leapt Rs 183.50 to Rs 2,600.45. 																								Stocks from Anil Ambanis group also resumed their upward journey. All the sectoral indices on the BSE ended in the green, with the oil and gas index recording the sharpest rise of 6.51 per cent.																								Todays surge has made the Ambani brothers arguably the richest in the world. The market value of the shareholdings of the two brothers stands at $91.41 billion, far ahead of even the Walton family of Wal-Mart.

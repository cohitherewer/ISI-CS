				 Spectrum pinch rings on CDMA turf
 JAYATI GHOSE																								New Delhi, Nov. 4: The government is exploring the possibility of a cap of 10MHz spectrum on telecom operators holding both CDMA and GSM licences.																								Proposed by the Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC), the norm is under consideration for the current round of spectrum allocation. Last week, the government accepted the TECs tough subscriber criterion for extra spectrum to GSM operators.																								If the government implements the 10MHz norm, the plans of CDMA operators will be hit as many of them intend to offer GSM services that will make them eligible for extra spectrum.																								Already the leading CDMA player, Reliance Communications (R-Com), has obtained permission to offer GSM services under its unified access service licence. 																								Tata Telecom, the other major CDMA player, has also applied for permission to offer GSM services. Officials, however, said the cap was temporary. It may go up if operators can significantly ramp up their subscriber base.																								For R-Com and the Tatas, the cap means they will not get spectrum beyond the 4.4MHz that an operator gets initially for GSM services. Each have about 3-5 MHz, and the 4.4 MHz will take their spectrum holdings close to 10MHz. They can hope to get very little, if any, extra spectrum space for their existing CDMA services at this juncture, officials of the department of telecommunication (DoT) said.																								Analysts said expectations of higher valuations from holding expensive spectrum was the key reason for the rush for GSM spectrum among CDMA operators. 																								With defence vacating spectrum by early 2008, these companies were hoping to not only get GSM spectrum, which comes as a package with the licence, but also additional spectrum for the CDMA services, the officials said.																								CDMA operators Shyam and HFCL have received the permission for GSM services. R-Com has paid the DoT Rs 1,651 crore as licence fee for GSM services.

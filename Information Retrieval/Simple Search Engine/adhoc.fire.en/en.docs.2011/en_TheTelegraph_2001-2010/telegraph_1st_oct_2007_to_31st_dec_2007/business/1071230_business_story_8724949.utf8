				 Trillion Dollar Leap

																								India will be a trillion-dollar economy by the end of this fiscal  that is, March 2008. The economy grew by 9.4 per cent in 2006-07 and it does look as though it will grow by at least 8.5 per cent this year  making the country one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. With inflation nailed down to a low 3.5 per cent, theres a decent chance that the country will be able to walk the fine line by ensuring growth without running the risk of a tearaway rise in prices.
																								But there are some worries as well: government spending continues to remain high; high crude oil prices create a climate of uncertainty on the price front; and for the first time, pensions will exceed the salary bill for government servants.
																								The bigger concern is whether the US economy will tip into a recession, sending shock waves through the less robust economies of the world.
																								The Cassandras reckon theres a crisis lurking in the shadows, but theres a passel of Pollyanas that believes India will ride out the storm.

				 Max Life to double equity base
 GARIMA SINGH NEOGY				 	 HEALTH IS WEALTH																								Panaji, Oct. 15: Max New York Life will infuse Rs 750 crore fresh capital by the end of 2008. This will double its equity base to Rs 1,557 crore from Rs 807 crore.																								The life insurer plans to introduce health insurance products next year. One of our focus areas will be to expand our portfolio to give a better range of product mix to our existing and new policyholders. We will launch health insurance products by the first quarter of next year, said Garry R. Bennett, managing director and CEO of the company.																								The products, which will be defined benefit plans, are for critical illness and hospital bills. We will file our products with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority later this year, said Debashis Sarkar, director (marketing) of Max New York Life. 																								Life insurance companies are betting big on health insurance. Insurers such as SBI Life and HDFC Standard Life are working on their product strategies. 																								ICICI Prudential and Bajaj Allianz have launched a range of standalone health insurance products.																								The Life Insurance Corporation of India also has plans to introduce a health insurance product. HDFC Standard Life and SBI Life will launch their schemes before the end of this financial year.																								Health insurance is estimated to have a penetration of 0.02 per cent or less of the gross domestic product. Over 75 per cent Indians spend on healthcare from their pockets. Healthcare costs have been rising over 20 per cent per annum.																								In India, health insurance is clubbed with general insurance, unlike other countries where health products are sold by life insurance companies. Hence, general insurance companies have concentrated on profitable businesses such as fire.																								However, after the removal of fixed tariffs in the general segment, players are taking a fresh look at health insurance.																								Max New York Life, a 74:26 joint venture between Max India Limited and US-based New York Life, has been in operation since 2001. The paid-up capital of Rs 807 crore includes an infusion of Rs 75 crore the company made in September this year.																								Max Life is present in 122 cities through 175 offices. It plans to open 150 offices as part of its expansion drive. It will set up 50 offices this year and the rest will be opened next year.																								On the breakeven target, Bennett said, Capital infusion to increase the footprint has led to the rationalisation of the breakeven deadline by one year. We hope to achieve it by the end of 2009.

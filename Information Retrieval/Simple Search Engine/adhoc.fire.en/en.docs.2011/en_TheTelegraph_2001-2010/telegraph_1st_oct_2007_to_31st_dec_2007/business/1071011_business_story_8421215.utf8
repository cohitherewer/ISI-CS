				 Mahindras firm up plans for retail entry
 OUR CORRESPONDENT, 																								Mumbai, Oct. 10: The Rs 18,000-crore Mahindra group is entering the retail business. The venture will be named Mahindra Retail.																								Raghunath Murti, executive vice-chairman of Mahindra Intertrade, said, The group believes that this is the opportune time to extend its business to direct retailing, when the organised retail market is expanding in India. 																								Mahindra Retail is planning multiformat stores for luxury lifestyle products, mainly in soft goods. 																								The stores will open within a year and the company will sell private labels and international brands.																								Indian retail is a $350-billion market and will touch the $500-billion-mark by 2011.																								According to KSA-Technopak, a retail consulting and research firm, the size of the organised retail market in the country will grow threefold to $21.5 billion in the next three years.																								Food and grocery is the biggest segment of the business followed by clothing, textiles and fashion accessories.																								Mahindra Retail will extend the reach of Mahindra Intertrade, which is in the trading business. 																								The company is open to bringing strategic investors at a later stage, and is now headhunting for senior positions. 																								It is looking for people with over 15 years of experience to head various divisions. In retail, the Mahindras are following in the footsteps of other big industrial houses such as Reliance, Bharti and the Tatas.																								Foreign retailers are allowed only in the wholesale segment. Policies, however, permit 51 per cent foreign direct investment in single-brand retail.

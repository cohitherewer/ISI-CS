				 Struggle for DCM intensifies
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 29: HB Stockholdings has raised the offer price for DCM Shriram shares to Rs 120 from Rs 70.																								The company holds about 14 per cent in DCM Shriram and has made the open offer for 35 lakh shares that will raise its stake by another 22.8 per cent. A notice on the revised price was sent to the Bombay Stock Exchange by the company today.																								The revised open offer follows DCM Shriram raising last week the price of warrants to be allotted to promoters on a preferential basis to Rs 90. 																								The warrant issue is being seen as a bid to thwart the takeover attempt. 																								Earlier this month, Harish Bhasin-led HB Stockholdings had made the open offer, which will open on January 3 and close on January 24.																								HB Stockholdings had approached the Company Law Board challenging DCM Shrirams decision to revise the issue price of the warrants. 																								After the board declined to stay the process of warrant allotment, the company moved Delhi High Court.																								Shares of DCM Shriram hit the upper circuit of 5 per cent at Rs 106.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today, while HB Stockholdings moved up 1.7 per cent to end at Rs 74.

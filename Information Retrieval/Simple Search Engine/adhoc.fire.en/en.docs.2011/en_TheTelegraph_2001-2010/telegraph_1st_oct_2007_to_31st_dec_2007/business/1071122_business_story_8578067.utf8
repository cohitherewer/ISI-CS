				 Sebi to allow realty investment trusts
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sebi chairman M. Damodaran flanked by Nimesh Kampani, chairman of JM Morgan Stanley, and K.V. Kamath, managing director of ICICI Bank, in Mumbai on Wednesday. (Fotocorp)																								Mumbai, Nov. 21: The capital market watchdog plans to shortly allow the flotation of real estate investment trusts (REITs) to make it easier for Indian investors to participate in the countrys burgeoning real estate sector.																								M. Damodaran, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, today said the regulator was finalising the guidelines for REITs and real estate mutual funds (REMFs).																								REITs are companies that buy, sell, manage and develop real estate assets. Like mutual funds do, REITs raise money from investors and institutions and deploy them in real estate projects. So if you want a piece of the action in the real estate market, all you have to do is buy the units or shares offered by a REIT. This entitles you to a share of the income generated by the REIT from its property investments. 																								Small investors who find it difficult to buy property could find the REIT attractive. You could invest in instalments of say Rs 5,000 or Rs 10,000 in a REIT every month. Or, you could park small sums in the REIT from time to time. Over time, the sum that you have saved up in your REIT will swell in line with property values. When the time comes, you can simply liquidate your REIT units and buy your home. 																								The accounting solution for valuation of real estate were being worked out by the Association of Mutual Funds in India and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. We want to ensure that investors can park their money with both REMFs and REITs, said Damodaran. 																								However, parts of Indias legal and tax framework will have to be changed before REITs can be launched.

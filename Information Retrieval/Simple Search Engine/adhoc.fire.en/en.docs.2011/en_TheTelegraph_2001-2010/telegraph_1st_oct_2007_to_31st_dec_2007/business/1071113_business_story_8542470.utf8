				 3G policy restricts field to few firms
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Telecom minister A. Raja (right) with Trai chairman Nripendra Misra in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Prem Singh																								New Delhi, Nov. 12: The government today said only three to six players would be allowed to offer 3G mobile services on a pan-India basis. 																								Spectrum for 3G services will be sold to telecom companies through an open auction process, where all firms will be allowed to bid.																								Communications minister A. Raja, who announced the guidelines today, said, 3G licences would be granted through a controlled auction, which would be held online by a specialised agency to ensure transparency in the selection process.																								The minister said he wanted healthy competition and that all telecom firms, existing as well as the new ones, would be allowed to bid for licences.																								However, foreign players would be allowed subject to security clearances from the home ministry.																								For GSM players, 3G spectrum would be auctioned in the 2.1 GHz band, while CDMA players would get spectrum in the 800 MHz band.																								Telecom secretary D.S. Mathur said, The government has around 30 MHz of spectrum, which will allow entry of not more than three to six players on a pan-India basis in the 3G mobile services area.																								If the government allows telecom operators to bid for 5MHz of spectrum each, six players will be accommodated. If it is 10 MHz, only three players will offer the service. 																								Besides a one-time spectrum fee, 3G operators will pay 0.5 per cent of their total adjusted gross revenues as an annual recurring charge. 																								This will be raised to 1 per cent after three years.																								There will also be a ban on mergers for the first five years of operations. Trading or reselling of spectrum will not be allowed.																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in its recommendations had proposed 3G spectrum in slots of 5MHz. 																								Trais reserve price for 3G spectrum was Rs 1,400 crore based on the 5MHz limit. 																								There is now the possibility of the reserve price getting raised to Rs 2,800 crore if an operator is given 10MHz.																								GSM operators are unhappy about these variations from Trai recommendations 																								The GSM lobby - the Cellular Operators Association of India  said it was illegal for the government to agree to a policy that was directly at variance with the recommendations of the telecom regulator.

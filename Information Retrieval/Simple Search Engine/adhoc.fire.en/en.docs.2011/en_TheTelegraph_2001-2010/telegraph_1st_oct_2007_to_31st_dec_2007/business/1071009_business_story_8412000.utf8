				 Job survey sees firms hiring less
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 8: The appreciating rupee, dipping margins and the US sub-prime crisis will hit the hiring intentions and business outlook of companies for the last quarter of this calendar year.																								Hiring intentions for the quarter beginning October is projected to be down by six percentage points to 78 per cent and the net business outlook is also expected to dip by 3 per cent to 81 per cent, a survey by TeamLease Services, a leading placement company said.																								Business confidence and hiring have hit an all time low. Margins in the IT sector are already under pressure over the last few quarters. The unprecedented appreciation of the rupee have added to their woes. The cost of HR capital in the IT sector is also the highest at 40 per cent. This has affected hiring, said TeamLease vice-president Sampath Shetty.																								While most cities have shown a decline in net business outlook for the current quarter, New Delhi has shown a significant increase of 12 per cent.																								IT-enabled services, manufacturing and engineering services sector have shown an increase of 5 and 2 per cent, respectively, in employment outlook, while financial services, infrastructure, IT, retail, media and FMCG have shown a marginal decline in employment outlook for the fourth quarter. Telecom has shown the second highest hiring index.																								The US sub prime fiasco has made the BFSI (banking, financial services amp; insurance) sector cautious about market penetration and future hiring. Rising interest rates have also slowed down the consumer credit off take, Sampath added.																								Retail, media amp; FMCG sectors show an increase of 1 per cent in business outlook, while all other sectors are either constant or show a marginal decline. 																								According to the survey, tier I cities (population between 20 lakh and 40 lakh) will record a drop in hiring compared with Tier II cities (population between 10 lakh and 20 lakh). 																								During the past quarter, Calcutta and Bangalore had highest average attrition rates of 19 and 17 per cent, respectively, whereas Chennai and Pune had the lowest at 2 and 5 per cent, respectively.																								Attrition rates in Calcutta and New Delhi at 28 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, have been the highest in the past one year.																								In the last quarter, the infrastructure sector has seen the highest attrition rate of 13 per cent, closely followed by manufacturing amp; engineering services, retail, media amp; FMCG and IT at 12 per cent.

				 Pearson India CEO moves up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Mumbai, Dec. 7: Pearson Education Indias CEO Subroto Mazumdar is moving to a larger stage. Mazumdar, who started Pearson from his own study in India 10 years ago, will now move to Harlow, Essex, as president, higher and professional education, at Pearson Education, UK. 
																								Mazumdar, 44, will take over from Christine Ozden who had been heading the education business for the last two years. It is indeed a big opportunity. I will be heading a 250-people and a $150-million business there, Mazumdar told The Telegraph today.
																								Pearson is the global leader in educational publishing, providing research-based print and digital programmes. The company is home to such brands as Prentice Hall, Addison Wesley, Longman, Allyn amp; Bacon, Benjamin Cummings, Custom Publishing and others.
																								Pearsons other primary businesses include the Financial Times Group and the Penguin Group.
																								I started Pearson in India in 1997 as a liaison office out of my study in Patpargunj in east Delhi. After a few years, we moved to a bigger office. In 2000, we moved to our current location. Right now we have two publishing centres, one in Chennai and the other in Chandigarh, said Mazumdar.

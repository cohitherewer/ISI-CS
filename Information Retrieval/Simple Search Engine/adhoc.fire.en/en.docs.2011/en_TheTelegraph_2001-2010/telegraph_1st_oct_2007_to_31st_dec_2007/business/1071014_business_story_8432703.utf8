				 BoB lowers home loan rates
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 13: The Bank of Baroda has slashed interest rates on home loans by 50 basis points to bring them in line with industry trends. Two days ago, the State Bank of India and ICICI Bank had cut rates.																								This is the second reduction by the bank in less than two months. 																								However, the lower rate is applicable only for loans sanctioned on or after October 15. 																								In August, the bank had reduced home loan rates by the same amount. The rates came into effect on September 1. 																								After the latest reduction, for floating rate loans of up to Rs 20 lakh, the rates will vary from 10 per cent to 10.5 per cent for different periods. For fixed rates, it will be 11 per cent to 11.5 per cent.																								Loans of more than Rs 20 lakh will have floating interest rates of 10.25-10.75 per cent and fixed rate of 11.25-11.75 per cent.																								Sources said this reduction did not fall under any festive scheme and the bank could review the rates in the future considering parameters, including cost of funds. They added that the revision was prompted by the fact that the banks peers had cut interest rates in recent times.																								The SBI, which had also announced cheaper home loans for new borrowers, had said the new rates would be applicable for all loans sanctioned on or after October 8 and would be valid till December 31. Bankers said interest rates paid by existing borrowers, which is benchmarked to the prime lending rate, could be reviewed only after the monetary policy that is due on October 30.																								Apart from the SBI, ICICI and the BoB, many other banks and institutions have lowered their rates by half a percentage point. These include HDFC, Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank. 																								Interest rates on home loans had been on the rise since the Reserve Bank began monetary tightening in 2004 to control inflation. It has resulted in interest rates on floating rate home loans rising by over 300 basis points.

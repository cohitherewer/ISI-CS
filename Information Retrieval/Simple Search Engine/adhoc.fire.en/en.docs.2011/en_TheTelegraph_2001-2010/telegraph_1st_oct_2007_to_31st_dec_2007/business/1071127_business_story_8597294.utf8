				 Spectrum tussle intensifies
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: GSM and CDMA cellular operators have started a fresh brawl over spectrum.																								Bharti Airtel, the No. 1 GSM operator in the country, today produced fresh data and challenged the governments subscriber-linked criterion for spectrum allocation.																								Reliance Communications, the leading CDMA player, has argued that GSM operators are capable of meeting the governments subscriber-linked criterion that promotes efficiency in spectrum use.																								This is manifested in the ability of GSM operators to add 4-5 million subscribers every month without extra spectrum, Reliance Communications said.																								Analysts said that this bickering would delay the finalisation of allocation norms, due by the end of this month, and the grant of spectrum.																								Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and managing director of Bharti Airtel, said, We have produced data which proves that the calculation of subscriber-linked criteria as proposed by the TEC (Telecom Engineering Centre) and Trai is not scientifically accurate. He was speaking to reporters after making a presentation to the panel on spectrum allocation set up by the department of telecom (DoT).																								Reliance Communications chairman Anil Ambani also made a presentation before the panel today. He said that based on scientific principles, TECs proposed norms could be further tightened by two to seven times for existing players.																								The TEC had proposed tough spectrum norms for GSM operators whose protest forced the DoT to set up the panel.																								Ambani had recently shot off a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stating that Bharti, Vodafone-Essar and Idea Cellular  the main GSM operators  should return 50 MHz of spectrum that are in excess of their entitlement.																								Mittal today said that GSM operators had 25MHz of spectrum and that Ambani should get his facts right.																								He said GSM operators were using the latest techniques of spectrum management and the government should not raise any questions on efficiency. GSM companies know how to run networks and ignorance (on the governments part) cannot be used for changing norms for subscriber based spectrum allocation criteria. 																								In his letter to the Prime Minister, Ambani had not only supported the TEC but also wanted the panel to objectively evaluate the TEC proposals without succumbing to pressure from a few GSM operators. 																								In September, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), had proposed that telecom companies should increase their subscriber base 2-6 times before they are granted additional spectrum. 																								This was challenged by the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the body of GSM operators, in the telecom tribunal.																								Subsequently, the government asked the TEC to evaluate the Trai proposal. 																								The COAI then challenged TECs norms that led to the setting up of the panel.

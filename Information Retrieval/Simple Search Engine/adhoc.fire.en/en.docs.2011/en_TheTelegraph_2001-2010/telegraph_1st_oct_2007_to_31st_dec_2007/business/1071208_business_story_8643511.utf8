				 SAIL keen to launch mine hunt

																								New Delhi, Dec. 7: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) sees a 2.3-billion-tonne shortfall of iron ore in the future and wants to find new mines to meet this gap.
																								The steel behemoth has filed for prospecting licences for 5,330 hectares at Karampada and 3,160 hectares at Ankua. It has also applied for mining licences for 500 hectares at Megataburu-Karampada and 2,580 hectares at Ghatkuri, all in Jharkhand. 
																								As part of its strategy to feed its Rs 53,000-crore expansion programme and its steel mills, SAIL has estimated it will require around 5.7 billion tonnes of iron ore over 50 years. Its existing mines, including Chiria, can supply 3.4 billion tonnes of ore. The Jharkhand government has been trying to take back a part of Chiria.
																								If SAIL is forced to lose a part of Chiria because of political pressure or is unable to source fresh iron ore mines ... it will sound the death knell for all its ambitious expansion plans, senior steel ministry officials said. 
																								SAIL faces a string of problems in Jharkhand. The state government challenges three of its leases in Chiria, Asias largest iron deposit with about 2 billion tonnes of ore. Moreover, the companys lease of conveyance for Bokaro has been denied for a long time and coal blocks have not been allocated to it. The state government also did not give it forest clearance for fresh mining in its Meghataburu block. 
																								Steel ministry officials said the kind of problems SAIL was encountering in Jharkhand had been most difficult to surmount. 
																								The company has also been trying to gain a mining licence in Orissas Thakurani area, but is yet to break free of the red tapes. 
																								SAIL has been facing troubles in Jharkhand in spite of the state being ruled by a coalition the Congress party supports. A legal row has erupted over the Jharkhand governments efforts to take back leases of Ajitaburu, Sukri-latur and Jhilingburu- I from SAIL. Talks mediated by the Prime Ministers Office to settle the row are yet to reach any conclusion as the state government will not accept SAILs iron ore demand projections. 
																								SAIL said it would set up a project at Manoharpur with a capacity of 12 million tonnes, apart from ramping up capacity at Bokaro to 17.5 million tonnes. Both these plants are in Jharkhand. It will also ramp up production at IISCO, Burnpur to 3.2 mt. These plants alone will consume Chirias 2-billion-tonne reserves. 
																								Jharkhand had said SAIL should be content with a 30-year supply of iron ore from Chiria and should allow a third of the mining area to be returned for allocation among rival steel makers.

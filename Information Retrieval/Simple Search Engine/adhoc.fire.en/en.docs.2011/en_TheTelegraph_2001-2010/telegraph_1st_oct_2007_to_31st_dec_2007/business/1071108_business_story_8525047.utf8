				 Crude close to $100-mark
																								London, Nov. 7 (Reuters): Crude oil sped above $98 a barrel for the first time today, closing in on the landmark $100 level, driven by a slumping dollar and worries over a winter-fuel-supply crunch.																								Analysts said it was only a matter of time before oil hit triple digits, with tightening stocks aiding a nearly 8 per cent rise over the past two weeks. Were going to get to $100 before too long, said Kevin Norrish of Barclays Capital.																								The US crude rose $1.46 by 1240 GMT to $98.16 having earlier hit a record $98.62. London Brent crude also hit a new peak of $95.19, and was later up $1.30 at $94.56.																								Investors, wary of global equity markets where the full blow of the credit crunch is yet to be felt, see commodities as a sure bet. Since mid-August, oil soared by nearly $30 and gold is at a 28-year high.																								Record weakness in the dollar has also helped fuel oils rally, as investors see dollar assets as relatively cheap.																								Oil gained momentum after the dollar plumbed to new lows against the euro as credit market turmoil kept alive the prospects of another Federal Reserve rate cut.																								The surge brings oil within a hair of the inflation-adjusted record peak of $101.70 hit in 1980 when war between Opec producers Iran and Iraq ignited an oil supply crisis.																								This time, demand  fuelled by exploding growth in China and a steady increase from the US  has been a major driver behind a more-than-quadrupling in the oil price since 2002.																								The rapid demand growth will see China overtaking the US as the worlds top energy consumer after 2010, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said. 																								We are experiencing high oil prices today and if actions are not taken in years to come, we can see a supply crunch which is not good news for anybody and it may end up with very high prices, IEA chief economist Fatih Birol said.

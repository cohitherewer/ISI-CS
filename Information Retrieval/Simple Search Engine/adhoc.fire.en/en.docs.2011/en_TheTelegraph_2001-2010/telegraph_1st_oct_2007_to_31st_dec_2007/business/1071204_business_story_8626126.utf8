 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Dec. 3: Mirae Asset Global Investment Management (India) Pvt. Ltd, South Koreas largest fund management house, is set to make its debut in India.																								Mirae plans to launch its first equity mutual fund in the country by the third week of January. It will be the first Korean asset management company in India.																								Mirae aims to invest $50 million as initial capital. 																								The company said it had received the licence from the Securities and Exchange Board of India to start its mutual fund business. It will be filing the offer document for the equity fund this week. 																								We are putting in place one of the largest investment teams for both equity and fixed income portfolio. We are planning to launch six to eight equity oriented and four fixed income funds in India over the next 16 to 18 months, said Arindam Ghosh, CEO of Mirae Asset Global Investment Management (India).																								Our portfolio will also include offshore funds that will invest in foreign equities to provide appropriate diversification opportunities to Indian investors, he added.																								The Mirae Asset Financial group, which manages assets worth over $130 billion across all its businesses, has a market share of more than 33 per cent in the Korean equity funds market. 																								Till October, the company has assets of $51 billion with its fund management arms. Officials said the group would be managing the mutual fund operations in India through its wholly owned subsidiary initially, but it would look for a suitable local partner in the long run. 																								The company is also into investor education. It has set up an education centre in Korea  Mirae Asset Investment Education Research Centre. 																								The centre has the capacity to train more than 300 personnel. We plan to mirror the initiative by setting up a separate division for investment education in India and ensure that we provide unbiased investment knowledge to the distributors and investors, Ghosh said. 																								In India, Mirae will distribute its products through public sector banks, regional banks and securities firms. 																								Apart from an equity-head and a fixed-income head, the company will employ three additional equity portfolio managers and two fixed-income managers. It will also have a separate team of credit analysts. 																								As a foreign institutional investor, Mirae has been investing in India over the past three years.

				 Deadline set for RIL gas deal review
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Tiff persists																								Mumbai, Oct. 15: Bombay High Court today asked Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) to renegotiate their gas supply master agreement within four months.																								Both the companies were locked in a legal battle over the terms of the agreement under which RIL is to supply gas to RNRL.																								The two sides have been squabbling over the price of the gas and other provisions of the agreement. 																								Reading out the operative part of the order today, Justice A.V. Mohta said the parties would have to renegotiate and execute a fresh agreement within four months, which must be commercially suitable to both parties and bankable. The order comes as a setback for Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries but there is still a long legal battle ahead.																								Justice Mohta observed that the understanding between Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani as part of the family settlement are binding on the individuals and the respective group companies. 																								This is the second order of the high court that has gone against RIL. Back in May, Justice Khanwilkar of the same court had passed an interim order that restrained RIL from selling any gas that was committed to RNRL to a third party. Justice Mohta today extended the application of that order for another four months.																								However, the restraint is only academic at this stage since RIL isnt producing any commercial gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin as yet. 																								Under the agreement between Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani, RIL was supposed to sell 28 million cubic metres of gas per day (mmscmd) from its Krishna-Godavari basin to RNRL at $2.34 per mmbtu (million British thermal units) for a period of 17 years. RNRL also had the first claim on 40 per cent of all gas discoveries that RIL would make in all its fields in the future. 																								In this case, the gas can																								 be procured at market prices. Further, RNRL can also																								 obtain 12 mmscmd of gas that was to flow to state-owned																							 National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).

				 Govt allays spectrum fears
 JAYATI GHOSE																								New Delhi, Nov. 6: The government says there is 60MHz of spectrum available for telecom operators, sufficient to meet the needs of not only older GSM players but also of some of the firms who have recently bid for a licence. 																								However, it wants the older players to use existing spectrum more efficiently before seeking fresh allocations.																								Officials of the department of telecom (DoT) said they had allocated only 35-40MHz of the 100MHz spectrum earmarked for 2G services. 																								The point on 60-65MHz of unused spectrum also got a mention in a letter from communications minister A. Raja to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. This 60-65MHz includes the 20MHz to be vacated by defence authorities next year.																								Therefore, there is enough scope for allotment of spectrum to a few new operators even after meeting the requirements of existing operators and licensees, Raja said in his letter to Singh.																								In the letter, Raja wrote of long waiting periods being not uncommon in the industry. At present, Aircel, Vodafone, Idea and Dishnet are still waiting for initial spectrum in some circles since December 2006. 																								The DoT officials said there should not be any problem in distributing the initial spectrum, but the operators would do well to use existing spectrum more efficiently by using additional technology such as signal boosters.																								Report review																								Succumbing to pressure from existing GSM operators, the government today set up a committee to review the report of the Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC) on spectrum allocation that was earlier accepted in-principle.																								The committee will recommend the revision of present spectrum allocation criterion to licensed operators based on subscriber figures in a scientific and practicable manner, an official statement said.																								The announcement comes within a week after Raja said the TECs report was accepted in-principle and informed the Prime Minister. The decision to form the panel is understood to have been taken after the Prime Ministers Office convened a meeting of senior DoT officials today evening, sources said. 																								Sunil Mittal, the chairman of the Bharti group, and brother Rajan met Raja in the morning and sought the review of spectrum allocation norms.

				 Subdued end to sizzling run
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, Nov. 8: The sensex tottered on the last day of Samvat 2063, plunging 231 points to close at 19058.93 as fresh worries about a global credit crisis spread across the Asian markets. 																								After touching an intra-day high of 20009.35 on Monday, the sensex had been on a downhill course and fell 3 per cent till midweek. Bank and realty stocks were the worst hit, sliding 2.51 and 2.07 per cent, respectively, today. 																								The market touched a low of 18917.40 during the day as concerns over the US subprime mortgage crisis pummelled global indices with the S amp;P 500 plunging 2.94 per cent to 1475.62 and Nikkei falling by 2.02 per cent to settle at 15771.57 points. 																								Almost all the major benchmark indices in the country today were in the red, with the broader NSE index ending down 1.24 per cent at 5710.50, midcap dropping 40.18 points and BSE 100 swooning by 117.82 points. 																								Asian markets fell as investors sold financial shares on credit worries after Wall Street tumbled on Wednesday as an investigation into the home loan industry ordered by New Yorks attorney general drew in the countrys biggest mortgage finance companies. 																								Because of weak foreign inflows, November will be a volatile month for the market. Liquidity being tight, brokerage houses are asking for funding from their clients. We are bullish about the market in terms of overall valuations in the long run. We estimate that the nifty should touch anywhere between 6250 and 6300 by December-end, Amitabh Chakraborty, president (equity) at Religare Enterprises, told The Telegraph.																								Foreign inflows have slowed this month after the market regulator tightened investment rules for unregistered foreigners. 																								FMCG was the only sector that ended in the green today. 																								All other sectoral indices were in the negative zone.

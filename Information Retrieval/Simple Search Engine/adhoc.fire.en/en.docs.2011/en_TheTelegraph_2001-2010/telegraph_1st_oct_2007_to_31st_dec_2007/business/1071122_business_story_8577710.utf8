				 Rules for alternative fuel use on way
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 NEW AVENUES																								New Delhi, Nov. 21: The government plans to come out with standards for alternative fuels as they will be widely used in city gas distribution projects and automobiles.																								The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board will formulate the guidelines for use of hydrogen, LPG and CNG as fuel for automobiles.																								It will also come out with safety norms as the alternative fuels will be used for cooking and the pipelines will pass through thickly populated localities.																								The governments target is to roll out city gas networks in about 200 cities over the next five years. This will involve an investment of Rs 60,000 crore, which works out to about Rs 300 crore per city.																								At present, only about half a million people in the country get gas in their kitchens, which is about 30 per cent cheaper than the traditional cooking fuel, LPG. The government plans to extend the reach of city gas to 20 million households over the next few years.																								Piped natural gas is distributed to retail customers in a handful of cities by companies such as Indraprashtha Gas, Mahanagar Gas and Gujarat Gas. The board has come out with draft regulations for developing city natural gas distribution networks, which multiple players can use to supply city gas.																								The guidelines say the companies laying the pipeline in a city will have life-long exclusivity and the marketing firms will have to pay an user fee for distributing the gas to homes or for use by automobiles.

				 Tatas plan warehouse hub in state
 SAMBIT SAHA 				 	 THE BIG PICTURE																								Calcutta, Nov. 4: Tata Realty and Infrastructure Ltd, the Tata groups infrastructure and real estate development arm, is planning to set up a business-cum-logistic park in the state. 																								The company has recently entered into a 50:50 joint venture with Dubai-based Jafza International to set up seven such parks in the country. Bengal is being considered as one of the locations. 																								These parks, modelled on Jebel Ali Free Trade zone, will be spread across 100-500 hectares. Warehousing and distribution facilities will be set up in that area. 																								Tata Realty and Jafza plan to invest Rs 2,400 crore to set up these parks in the first phase. 																								The first park is expected to come up in a couple of years, Tata Realty CEO Dinesh Chandioke said. 																								The companies are yet to announce specific locations, as land acquisition is a hurdle in the country.																								Chandioke, however, said one of the parks might be set up in the state. 																								Business and logistic parks are usually built near ports to help move export and import cargoes. 																								Each park will have a separate free trade warehousing zone and a domestic tariff area unit. 																								The parks will be set up in different phases and each one will provide multimodal connectivity for both international and domestic trade. 																								Tata Realty will try to acquire land on its own or seek government assistance depending on a local situation. 																								The Tatas are also coming up with an IT park and a housing project in Rajarhat. 																								The first phase will come up over 50 acres, which will be expanded to 200 acres. 																								While Tata Housing Development Company Ltd is primarily handling the IT park project, Tata Realty could also play a part in it. 																								This project is likely to be launched in two to three weeks. Tata Realty is setting up eight IT parks in the country. 																								The company also plans to bid for the modernisation of airports partnering Singapores Changi Airports International. It is bidding for the rapid transport system project in Mumbai. 																								It will also take up SEZ projects in the future. 																								Chandioke said Tata Realty would focus on FDI-compliant, large-scale projects only in the infrastructure and realty space. 																								The company recently concluded a $750-million realty fund, including $50 million contribution from Tata Realty itself, to invest in India. 																								The logistic parks will also be partly financed from this fund. Tata Realty is planning to launch an infrastructure fund with a corpus over $1 billion next year.

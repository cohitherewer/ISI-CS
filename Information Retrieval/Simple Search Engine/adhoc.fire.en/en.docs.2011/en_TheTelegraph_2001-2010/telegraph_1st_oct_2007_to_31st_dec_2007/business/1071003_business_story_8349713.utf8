				 Tulip plans overseas buyout
 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA				 	 GROWING NETWORK 																								Calcutta, Oct. 2: Delhi-based telecom services and IT solutions provider Tulip IT Services Ltd is planning overseas acquisitions.																								We are planning to grow our international business rapidly. We have a managed network services division and we hope to grow inorganically to boost this business, said chairman and managing director H.S. Bedi.																								The managed network services division will operate data centres. The Internet data centre market in India is set to grow to $200 million by 2009.																								The company has also received the international long distance (ILD) licence from the department of telecom. The licence will allow the company to address the needs of its customers for international voice, video and data connectivity. 																								We foresee the ILD licence as an opportunity that will enable us to provide high-end services in the burgeoning virtual private network bandwidth market, Bedi said.																								According to industry estimates, the international connectivity market is expected to double to Rs 3,600 crore in 2012 from Rs 1,800 crore in 2006.																								The company expects to maintain its 49 per cent growth rate this fiscal.																								Tulip has recently decided to raise $125 million through bonds with an option to increase the issue by another $25 million.																								The bonds will be issued to meet the capital expenditure requirements for overseas acquisitions as well as infrastructure expansion, said Bedi. E-governance will be another area of growth for the company as states under the national e-governance programme will have a budget of around Rs 100 crore each.																								The company has won a contract to develop the state-wide area network in Bengal and Haryana and has implemented the Akshaya Project for the government of Kerala.																								Data centres for the governments of Goa and Uttaranchal are also being built by Tulip.

				 Wagon hub in Bengal
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 13: City-based Texmaco Ltd today entered into an agreement with Australian firm United Group Rail Services Ltd to set up a plant for manufacturing wagons in Bengal. 																								The proposed joint venture will design, manufacture and supply wagons, locomotive bogies and components. 																								We plan to make the biggest wagon hub, providing end-to-end solutions not only in Bengal but the whole of Asia Pacific. We are looking for land in excess of 100 acres though work will initially start in our five factories, said Ramesh Maheshwari, president and CEO of Texmaco. 																								We have a buy-back arrangement under which we will ship components back to Australia as well. In the next three months, we will do a detailed study of the Indian market and then start work on the common facility. The project will employ around 2,000 people. For one directly employed person, there will be three indirectly employed, said Andy Summers, chief executive (rail) of United Group Ltd.																								The Australian firm, which is an end-to-end rail technology solutions provider, is set to have a $5-billion turnover by the year-end.																								In September, GE Equipment Services (Europe amp; Asia) picked up a 15 per cent stake in JP Chowdharys Titagarh Wagons for $35 million.																								GP Goenka-owned Stone India Ltd is looking to increase its turnover to Rs 300 crore from Rs 130 crore in the next three years and become a complete railway solutions company which will manufacture each and every component.																								Stone India Ltd inked a technical collaboration pact with Sumitomo Electric Industries of Japan to manufacture air springs for rail coaches. 																								Indian Railways, which adds more than 2,800 coaches every year, will use this technology for future production and selectively upgrade its rolling stock of about 25,000 coaches.

				 BHP buyback sop for Rio shareholders
				 	 Acquisition mode																								Sydney, Nov. 12 (Reuters): BHP Billiton Ltd/Plc mapped out its plan on Monday to acquire rival Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc, promising to hand $30 billion to shareholders via a share buyback if the deal goes through and signalling it was ready for a long fight.																								BHPs new CEO, Marius Kloppers, said he would step up the pressure to draw Rios board into talks by pitching BHPs $140-billion takeover proposal to major Rio shareholders, more than two-thirds of whom also own BHP stock.																								The process will start now, Kloppers, who has been CEO for six weeks, told a media telephone conference, adding that as no formal offer has been launched there was no need for BHP to consider going hostile. BHP has so far failed to persuade Rios board to discuss its three-for-one all-scrip proposal aimed at assembling a mega force in mining of everything from iron ore and manganese to copper and diamonds.																								Our focus is on the proposal that is on the table ... We will be very patient to get this message out, Kloppers said.																								A Rio spokesman said there was nothing new in a nine-page document issued by BHP outlining its vision for a combined company. 																								The proposal, already rejected by Rios board as too low, remained well out of the ballpark, the spokesman said.																								It looks like BHP may have to up the ante a bit, said Eric Betts, equities strategist at Nomura Australia. It could take a while for this thing to play out.																								Kloppers said a merger with Rio could mean $3.7 billion in annual savings after seven years through synergies in iron ore, coal and other activities. He gave no timeframe for the proposed share buyback.																								The savings would mostly be through higher production runs and efficiencies of scale, which would also help buffer cyclical downswings in commodities markets.																								Dividend policy																								BHP vowed to maintain a progressive dividend policy post-merger, reassuring investor concern that there could be little cash left for future dividends.

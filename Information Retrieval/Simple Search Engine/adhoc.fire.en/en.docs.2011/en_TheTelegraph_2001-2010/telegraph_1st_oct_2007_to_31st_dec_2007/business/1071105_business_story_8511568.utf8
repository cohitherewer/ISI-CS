 Should you pre-pay an older, costlier housing loan and opt for a lower-interest one? Srikumar Bondyopadhyay exploresOver three million families in the country saw their household budgets fall apart after a steep 4.5 percentage point rise in home loan rates between April 2005 and April 2007. To add to their woes, bankers are offering lower rates during the festival season to new borrowers only, while they continue to pay a higher interest rate.																								You may find this discrimination between existing and new customers unethical, but who cares? Getting more borrowers on board is a banks only goal and there is no loyalty reward for existing customers. 																								Banks argue that these lower rates are special offers for the festival season and the interest rate for existing borrowers will come down as and when the bank lowers its benchmark prime lending rate to which the retail lending rates are linked. 																								A way out																								Banks charge a pre-payment penalty of 2 per cent of the outstanding principal amount. Would it be worthwhile to prepay the existing loan and take a new one at a rate  only 50 basis points lower  that is being offered by the same bank or some other bank to new customers? 																								The answer is yes if under the existing loan repayment schedule you have to pay EMIs for more than five years. But if it is less than five years, a switchover will not be profitable. 																								The amount and frequency of interest rate fluctuations increased significantly since the beginning of the new millennium. The home loan rate was around 14 per cent in 2000, but it sharply fell to 7.5 per cent by the third quarter of 2003. From 2005, it again started rising and by April this year it rose to 12 per cent. 																								Coupled with this, banks have stopped offering a plain-vanilla-fixed-interest rate  a rate that remains fixed for the entire tenure of the loan. 																								Home loans that banks are now offering as a fixed rate come with a reset clause after a specific period. For some banks, the reset period is two years, for some others it is three years, and some keep a provision to revise rates at the end of every five years. Moreover, these fixed rates are at least 1 percentage point higher than the floating rate for the same tenure and amount of the loan. 																								All these have made home loans more susceptible to interest rate risks. Therefore, borrowers need to be more vigilant on interest rate changes as this would have serious implications on their interest cost and repayment capability.																								Does it work?																								Let us now examine when a loan switchover makes sense with the illustration of two borrowers (see table). Both the borrowers take loans of Rs 10 lakh each at the same rate of interest of 7.5 per cent but at different points of time and for different tenures. One takes the loan in September 2003 for five years and the other takes the loan in January 2005 for 20 years. 																								Thus, at the beginning of October this year, the first borrower will have 12 EMIs left to repay his loan, while the second borrower will have to pay his EMIs for 208 months more. 																								Here we have considered the rate rises between April 2005 and April 2007 (banks last raised their home loan rates in April this year). At the beginning of October  since when banks started offering a 50-basis-point lower rate as festive offer (for new customers only)  the principal outstanding of the two borrowers is Rs 2,17,789 and Rs 9,46,613, respectively. It is also assumed that banks didnt increase the original repayment tenures for the borrowers following rate increases. Instead, they raised the borrowers EMIs. 																								From October this year till the end of their respective loan tenures, the two borrowers interest outgo will be Rs 13,284 and Rs 13,06,622, respectively, if they stick to their existing lenders at 12 per cent rate of interest. But if they choose the new offer of 11.50 per cent interest rate, the interest burden will be Rs 12,721 for the first borrower and Rs 12,41,403 for the second borrower. This would mean a saving of Rs 563 only for the first borrower and Rs 65,219 for the second borrower. 																								The difference																								However, for switching over to the new offer, the first borrower will have to pay a prepayment penalty of Rs 4,355.78, while the second borrower will have to pay Rs 18,932.26. 																								Thus the switching would mean a loss of Rs 3,792.78 for the first borrower who has only 12 months left to repay his loan. But it would result in a saving of Rs 46,286.74 for the second borrower who has 208 EMIs more to repay his loan.

				 Stock gloom deepens
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 19: The stock market today lost 2.44 per cent, falling for the third consecutive day on worries about a sharp drop in foreign capital inflow.																								The sensex today fell 438.41 points to settle at 17559.98, after touching the lowest level this week at 17226.18 during the day. 																								The sensex has steadily declined by almost 7.86 per cent during the week, after closing at a historic high of 19058.67 on Monday.																								Almost all the major benchmark indices slipped into the red today, with traders fearing the exit of foreign investors in large numbers if the regulator goes ahead with its proposal to check capital inflows through participatory notes. 																								While the BSE 100 slumped 274.69 points and the midcap index fell by 187.66 points, the smallcap index closed 278.43 points down. 																								In the broader market, 2,172 losers outpaced 517 gainers on a volume of 422.6 million shares. 																								The 50-share Nifty lost 2.54 per cent to close at 5215.30. 																								Experts believe that the market will go through more turbulence next week unless Sebi sets aside the proposal on October 25. 																								The market will regain its composure only after investors gain clarity on participatory notes. The quarterly corporate earnings have been factored in, but the regulators decision to moderate capital inflows will affect the market for some time, and it might not witness the same growth as it did over the past few weeks, an analyst said. 																								The backlash was experienced by all the BSE sectoral indices today, except for the IT index that saw a 0.21 per cent surge after Wipro announced strong quarterly numbers. 																								While the metal index fell 3.66 per cent, realty and oil amp; gas declined by 3.51 and 3.03 per cent, respectively.

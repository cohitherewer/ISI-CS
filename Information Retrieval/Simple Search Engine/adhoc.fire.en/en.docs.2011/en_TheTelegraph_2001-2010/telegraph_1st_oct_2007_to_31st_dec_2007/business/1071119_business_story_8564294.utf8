				 Open to closed funds
 Fund houses are betting big on close-ended schemes, despite lower returns. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay studies the paradoxTime and not timing is what equity investors should look at, say experts. This is the latest sales pitch of mutual fund houses for their close-ended products.																								In recent times, mutual funds have started launching close-ended schemes with renewed vigour because unlike open-ended plans, these are allowed to amortise new issue expenses over a period of five years after the offer. 																								So, mutual funds can offer the close-ended schemes to investors at a zero entry fee and deduct initial issue expenses from the investment fund in equal instalments over the five years.																								Mutual funds were barred from offering zero-entry load on open-ended schemes from April last year. 																								Thanks to the misconception about getting units at their face value, close-ended funds have never met with a dearth of investors. 																								Returns dilemma																								However, close-ended funds have failed to give better returns compared with open-ended schemes across all categories (see table). 																								Before 1993, almost all mutual fund schemes were close-ended. 																								Private players were allowed to participate in mutual funds from 1993 and the next two years saw the launch of open-ended schemes. 																								The open-ended schemes reaped the benefits of the stock market surge that began in 1993 and started offering much higher returns compared with the ill-managed close-ended funds. 																								Therefore, between 1997 and 2000, many close-ended schemes were converted to open-ended ones. The returns from the close-ended funds improved substantially after the conversion. 																								Even tax saving equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS), which were allowed to go open-ended in 1999, showed a marked improvement in their performances.																								A similar trend can also be witnessed among more recently launched schemes. 																								ICICI Prudential Fusion Fund, which was launched in February last year, gave a little more than 35 per cent return compared with an average of 50.35 per cent for open-ended diversified equity schemes. 																								Core sector funds																								Let us consider infrastructure funds that gave the highest returns among diversified equity schemes.																								Birla Sun Life Infrastructure Fund, a three-year close-ended fund launched in February last year, yielded a little over 65 per cent. Its open-ended peers, such as UTI Infrastructure Fund, gave more than 76 per cent, Tata Infrastructure, 82 per cent and Sahara Infrastructure Fund, 79 per cent. 																								Lower expenses																								However, expenses in a close-ended fund are lower because the rate of portfolio churn is more for open-ended schemes.																								An open-ended scheme pays more security transaction tax and brokerage charges than a close-ended fund. Despite this, the average return on the open-ended scheme is higher. 																								In an open-ended scheme, where investors can buy or sell units whenever they want, the fund manager is always on his toes to generate more returns to circumvent redemption pressures and deploy new fund flows into the scheme.																								A fund manager in a close-ended fund doesnt have to confront either the daily redemption pressure or new cash flows into the scheme. 																								Hence, in a close-ended scheme, the selection of stocks in the investment portfolio is likely to be more influenced by the fund managers bias. 																								Market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India is taking a close look at mutual funds new-found love for close-ended schemes in recent times. 																								Sebi may impose a ban on amortisation of new issue expenses in close-ended schemes. 																								The move aims at bringing transparency in the manner in which mutual funds charge expenses to close-ended schemes. The proposal has implications for investor returns too, said A.P. Kurian, chairman of the Association of Mutual Funds in India. 																								We have received a proposal from the market regulator and we are examining it, Kurian added.

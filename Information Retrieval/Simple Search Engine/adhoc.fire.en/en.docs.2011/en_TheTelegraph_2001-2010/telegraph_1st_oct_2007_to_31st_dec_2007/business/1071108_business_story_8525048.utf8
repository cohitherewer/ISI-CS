				 GSM duo to carry on fight
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 7: Bharti and Vodafone will continue their legal fight against the government over spectrum, unlike GSM peers Aircel and Spice who have steered clear of a confrontation.																								There is no question of withdrawing the lawsuit against the DoT, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal told reporters today. 																								GSM operators, including Bharti, Vodafone, Aircel and Spice, had moved the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) last month through their industry association, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI). 																								Subsequently, Aircel and Spice withdrew, following government assurances of the review of subscriber norms for spectrum allocation.																								The COAI is eager to fight it out before the TDSAT despite the pullout. We are gearing up for November 12, the next date for hearing the case, said T.V. Ramachandran, director-general, COAI. 																								The association today filed additional affidavits against the recommendations of the Telecom Engineering Centre  the technical arm of the department of telecom (DoT)  on spectrum and the out-of-turn allocation of this scarce resource to state-owned operators Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited.																								GSM operators are unhappy with the government move to accept the TEC suggestions on spectrum and allow CDMA players to offer GSM services. The TEC had hiked subscriber requirements for extra spectrum to GSM operators.																								The DoT, on its part, had said that existing GSM operators would get preference over new entrants in the allocation of spectrum. A committee was also set up by the government to review the TEC recommendations. 																								COAI officials said Spice and Aircel stand to benefit from the governments policy of spectrum on a first come, first served basis as they already hold licences and are waiting for spectrum.																								Earlier telecom minister A. Raja in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had stated that TEC had adopted a scientific criteria and this should be accepted by all.

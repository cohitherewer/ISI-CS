				 Tata unit to widen reach
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 20: steeljunction, the retail venture of Tata Steel, is planning to expand to tier II cities of Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa.																								The eastern region will have eight franchisee outlets by March 2008.																								We are opening a steeljunction Express in Barasat on November 23. For tier II cities we are looking at express formats spread across 1,500 to 2,500 square feet compared with the 20,000-square-foot steeljunction in Calcutta. These outlets will have more of Tata products and lower priced steel hardware, furniture, utensils and other accessories. The product mix will vary according to the surrounding region, said Sarvesh Kumar, chief of agrico and retail, Tata Steel, on the sidelines of a conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry in the city.																								The retail venture is expected to clock a turnover of Rs 15 crore by the end of this fiscal. It is expected to go up to Rs 28 crore in the next financial year.																								There is a steeljunction outlet in Siliguri. Other cities being considered for expansion are Asansol, Durgapur, Ranigunj, Murshidabad and Krishnanagar in Bengal and Ranchi and Bhubaneswar, the capitals of Jharkhand and Orissa, respectively. 																								In the Calcutta store, about 8 to 10 per cent of the turnover comes from Tata brands but in tier II towns this will be as high as 40 to 50 per cent. We chose to launch the format in eastern India as we wanted locations where we could leverage the brand, said Kumar.																								A foray into other regions is on the anvil during the next fiscal. The concept of a specialised store is not like any other retail format and, therefore, takes time to expand, Kumar added.

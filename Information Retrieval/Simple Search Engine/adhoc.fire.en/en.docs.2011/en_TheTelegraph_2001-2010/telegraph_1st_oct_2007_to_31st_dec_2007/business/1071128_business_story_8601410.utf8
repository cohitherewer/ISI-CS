				 Land hurdle to big power projects
 R. SURYAMURTHY				 	 Core issues																								New Delhi, Nov. 27: The governments ambitious mega-power-project programme has been hit by problems relating to land acquisition, coal supply and environment.																								Officials in the power ministry said the Tamil Nadu government was finding it difficult to acquire land at a reasonable rate for the Cheyyur project, prompting it to rein in on plans for a second project.																								Maharashtra, too, is finding the going tough with land, while the Karnataka government is facing a barrage of criticisms on environment for its Tadri project.																								In Chhattisgarh, the project at Akaltara has got bogged down because of coal leases.																								Tamil Nadu is balking at the land cost at Cheyyur and considering to shift the project to Cuddalore.																								The land at Cheyyur costs Rs 30-40 lakh per acre, while at Cuddalore it is Rs 4-5 lakh per acre. The project requires 2,500 acres.																								The officials said the state was exploring the possibility of changing the site because high land cost coupled with expensive imported coal would inflate tariff.																								Besides, the Centres decision to hike the performance guarantee for developers who have already bagged one such project makes Tamil Nadu an unattractive destination for these developers.																								The problems with Cheyyur have led the DMK-run state government to almost abandon its plans for another mega project at Marakkanam.																								Tamil Nadu has installed power generation capacity of 10,000 mega watt (MW) and plans to increase it to 13,000MW by the end of the Eleventh Plan (2007-12).																								In Girye, the site for the project in Maharashtra, mango farmers have refused to move to an alternative site as the land at the new site is not suitable for alphonso mangoes that have a lucrative market in the US.																								There are plans to develop nine mega power projects that are expected to add 36,000MW to capacity.																								The government has awarded the Mundra project in Gujarat to Tata Power and the Sasan project in Madhya Pradesh to Reliance Power. 																								Tata Power had quoted Rs 2.26 per unit for Mundra which will run on imported coal, while Reliance Powers quote for Sasan, which will run on pit-head coal, is Rs 1.19 per unit.																								The government is expected to issue the letter of intent for Andhra Pradeshs Krishnapatnam project to Reliance Power, which had placed the lowest bid of Rs 2.33 per unit.																								For the Tilaiya project in Jharkhand, 13 firms have submitted bids.																								The power ministry now fears missing the target for such projects, given the problems.																								For the Eleventh Plan, the power ministry has set a capacity addition target of 78,577MW of which 10,000MW is a spillover from the Tenth Plan.																								The government had set a target of 41,000MW for the Tenth Plan but managed to add 21,000MW. At present, installed capacity in the country is 136,000MW.

				 Airtel net rises 73%
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 31: Bharti Airtel today posted a 73 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 1,614 crore in the July-September quarter against Rs 934 crore a year ago despite growing competition and a decline in tariff rates.																								Quarterly revenue rose 45 per cent to Rs 6,337 crore. 																								The company also announced that it was open to offloading stake to financial and operating partners in its tower business, but only after the demerger of the businesses in the current quarter. 																								We expect the legal demerger of our tower company, Bharti Infratel, to be complete in this quarter ... We are open to inducting financial partners and operator partners after it, said president Manoj Kohli. 																								Bharti intends to retain a minority stake in its tower company after the demerger. 																								In July, telecom operator Reliance Communications sold 5 per cent of its tower business for Rs 1,400 crore, spurring analysts to mark up valuations of Bhartis tower unit, saying it was worth Rs 40,000 crore or more.																								On its financial performance, Kohli said, Improved margins and a record addition of subscribers helped Bharti Airtel post a higher profit.

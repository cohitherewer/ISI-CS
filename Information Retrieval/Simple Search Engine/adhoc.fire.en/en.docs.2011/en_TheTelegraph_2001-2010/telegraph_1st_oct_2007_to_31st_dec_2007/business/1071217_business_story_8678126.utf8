				 Exporters present wish list to stop job loss

 R.SURYAMURTHY
																								New Delhi, Dec. 16: Exporters are in favour of a long-term policy against the rising rupee.
																								In the absence of such norms, there will be heavy job losses, they said.
																								Hit by the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar, exporters have retrenched 30,000 regular employees and 100,000 contract labourers.
																								They have suggested a corpus to refinance banks for covering their hedging charges. 
																								The dollar rates that are relevant for some schemes should also be fixed, according to Ganesh Kumar Gupta, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo).
																								He said, Irrespective of the value of the dollar, exporters should be credited for duty drawbacks and other tax rebates at a fixed rate so that the money which flows from the government remains fixed. 
																								According to Kumar, the government should also ask banks to reduce the general interest rate by 100-125 basis points. 
																								This will lead to a fall in export credit rates. 
																								Such a reduction will encourage companies to raise resources internally rather than through external commercial borrowings (ECB). 
																								During April-June, the ECB inflow into the country stood at $7.05 billion. 
																								The package on credit recently announced by the government should be extended till December 2008 to enable better planning, Gupta added. 
																								Exporters also want all indirect taxes levied by state governments and municipalities to be refunded. 
																								The levies include central sales tax, sales tax on diesel and petrol, electricity duty, mandi tax, turnover tax and octroi. 
																								In some states, local taxes make up as much as 4-5 per cent of the export value.
																								Gupta also wants the Centre to give exemptions on all service taxes instead of refunds on 11 services. 
																								He said the refund process was cumbersome, time consuming and added to the already high transaction costs. 
																								Recently, the Centre had raised the rate of tax refund by an average of one per cent on a number of textile and garment items, the fourth such move this year.
																								The Fieo chief also suggested that the government should not implement amendments with retrospective effect. 
																								Since July, the finance ministry has raised tax refund rates, cut bank lending rates, and slashed some import duties to ease the pressure on exporters. 
																								Indias exports rose 35.7 per cent in October to $13.30 billion. Imports rose 24.3 per cent to $20.79 billion in October.
																								Exports for the current fiscal is expected to touch $140-145 billion against a target of $160 billion, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said. 
																								Analysts said the rupee might not rise in the future by 15 per cent as it did this year.
																								However, the buoyant pace of the Indian economy will result in a hardening of the domestic currency by at least 3-4 per cent per annum for the next couple of years.
																								According to official estimates, in rupee terms, exports have gone down by 56 per cent for handicrafts, about 25 per cent for textiles, 6 per cent for leather products, 33 per cent for tea and 20 per cent for coffee.

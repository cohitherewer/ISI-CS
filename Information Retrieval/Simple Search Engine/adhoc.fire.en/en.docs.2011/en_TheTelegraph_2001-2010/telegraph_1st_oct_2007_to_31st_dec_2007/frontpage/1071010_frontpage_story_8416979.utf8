				 Man kills daughters to shield sisters
 GAUTAM SARKAR																								Soraiyahat (Dumka), Oct.																								 9: Hard to buy, but a man brutally killed his																								 daughters to evade arrest of his sisters for murdering																								 his wife.																								Nundev Yadav, a Deoghar resident, strangled his seven-year-old daughter, Sujata, and killed her siblings nine-month-old Chhoti and four-year-old Sunita by suffocating them under water.																								He still remembers the last words of Sujata. Papa please dont kill Chhoti. I will never disclose who our mothers killers are, was Sujatas last request to her father, Nundev, grandfather and two aunts before she was brutally killed. 																								Nundev (38) confessed to his crime inside Soraiyahat police station on Monday. 																								I killed my three girls, said Nundev, a resident of Malghaghar hamlet under Mohonpur block in Deoghar district and the prime accused in the murder of his wife and daughters. Police are yet to arrest Chandmuni Devi and Sushila Devi, the married sisters of Nundev, also accused in the murder with their father, Ajodhi Mahto (55). 																								On October 2, the bodies of two girls (Sujata and Sunita) were recovered from a ditch near Jiajore village under Soraiyahat police station, 67km from Dumka. The next day, the bodies of Nundevs wife and Chhoti were found in a well and a ditch about one-and-a-half-km away. 																								The police finally nabbed Nundev after his in-laws alleged foul play in the episode. 																								The murder was allegedly a fallout of a quarrel between Nundevs wife and sister. Nundev said he and his father worked in a private dairy in Deoghar, 46km away from their native place. 																								According to him, his two married sisters Chandmuni Devi and Sushila Devi came to Malghaghar, their parents house, for Karma Puja. 																								On September 28, when Nundev and his father were away from house, his wife, Kushni Devi, was strangled to death by his sisters. 																								Earlier Chandmuni had borrowed a pair of silver bangles from my wife. There was a quarrel between the two when the former demanded the silver ornaments. After Kushni reportedly punched Chandmuni my sisters strangulated her, Nundev told the police. 																								My sisters dumped the body of my wife in the kitchen and locked the girls inside the house before rushing to Deoghar to inform us. We hired an autorickshaw for Rs 1,000 and proceeded to our village. We picked up two relatives from Deoghar. 																								According to Nundev, they proceeded towards Soraiyahat and told the children that they were going to their uncles house at Patsar. Instead, they first threw Kushnis body in a well. 																								Nundev then killed his nine-month-old daughter by holding the infants head under water in a ditch. The rest of the siblings were killed, too. 																								Upendar Kumar, the officer-in-charge of Sorahiyahat police station, said Nundevs sisters were absconding.

				 Buddhadev removes police commissioner
																								Calcutta, Oct 17 (PTI) - Bowing to intense public pressure, West Bengal chief minister Buddhadev Bhattacharjee today removed five police officers, including the Kolkata Police Commissioner, a day after the Calcutta High Court ordered a CBI investigation into the mysterious death of Rizwanur Rehman.																								The officers removed were Police Chief Prasun Mukherjee, two deputy commissioners Gyanwant Singh and Ajay Kumar, assistant commissioner of the anti-rowdy section Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Ghosh.																								The chief minister said that the police officers were being transferred since questions were raised from different sections and the media. They were allegedly involved in the death of the computer graphics teacher Rehman who was pressurised to part with his hindu wife, Priyanka, the daughter of industrialist Ashok Todi.																								 He, however, refused to take any question on who would succeed Prasun Mukherjee as the Police Commissioner and where they would be transferred. He said now they were transferred, the next course of action would depend on the judicial inquiry and the court order.																								To a question if he had referred industrialist Ashok Todi to the police commissioner, the chief minister retorted I dont know Ashok Todi. I never saw him and I will never see him. Asked why the state government had not appealed against yesterdays High Court order, he said it was due to political reasons.																								The state government has decided to accept the CBI investigation considering all opinions.																								Bhattacharjee pointed out that it was the state government which had on its own opted for a CBI probe into the Purulia Armsdrop Case, the theft of Tagores Nobel medallion and the Tapasi Malik murder case.																								We are waiting for its ruling and everybody will accept its verdict, he said.

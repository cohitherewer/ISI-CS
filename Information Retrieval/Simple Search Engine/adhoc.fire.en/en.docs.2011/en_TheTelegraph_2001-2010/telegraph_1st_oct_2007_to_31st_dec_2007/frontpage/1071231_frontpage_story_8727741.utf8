				 Congress hint in Koda act 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Ranchi, Dec. 30: Chief minister Madhu Koda has allegedly tried to keep the Congress in good humour by appointing Brij Mohan Verma as the new Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) chairman.
																								Verma, the former CMD of Uttarakhand Power Corporation, has good connections in the Congress. It was the erstwhile Congress regime in Uttarakhand that made Verma the CMD of UPCL. However, he was replaced after BJP came to power earlier this year. Some of the former JSEB chairmen were in the race for their re-appointment as the board chief. There were also talks that a senior IAS officer would be given additional charge of the board. But ignoring the other options, Koda appointed Verma, apparently to send the right message to the peeved Congress camp.
																								Congress has served an ultimatum to Koda to improve his governments performance by January 15 or face the music. Verma, an electrical engineer, would be the eighth chairman of JSEB after it was created in 2001. The new incumbent is expected to assume charge tomorrow morning. The big question, however, is that can Verma improve the power scenario or meet the same fate of his predecessor.
																								JSEB officials said changing chairman was not the main panacea to improve the state of power sector in this state.

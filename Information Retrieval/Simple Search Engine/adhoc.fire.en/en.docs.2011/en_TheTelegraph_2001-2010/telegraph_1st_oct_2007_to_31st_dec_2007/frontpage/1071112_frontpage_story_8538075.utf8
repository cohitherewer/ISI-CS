				 Parties plan post-Diwali bang 
 															- Gogoi govt to table report on secret killings in Assembly A STAFF REPORTER																								Guwahati, Nov. 11: Diwali may be over, but expect some more blazing fireworks tomorrow when Assams elected representatives get cracking in the Assembly  against one another, that is.																								The ruling Congresss weapon for the five-day session will be the report on secret killings and the combined Opposition will be aiming to put the government on the mat over a host of other issues.																								Giving a sneak peek into the K.N. Saikia Commissions report on extra-judicial killings in Assam between 1998 and 2001, chief minister Tarun Gogoi said recently that the revelations in it would put even the perpetrators of the Gujarat carnage to shame. 																								An AGP-led alliance was in charge and Prafulla Kumar Mahanta was the chief minister when the killings occurred. Most of the victims were relatives and friends of Ulfa activists. 																								While the report could put the AGP in a spot of bother, it wont be easy for the government either. Opposition parties have joined hands to unleash a counter attack by raking up diarrhoea deaths in tea gardens, alleged anomalies in the installation of digital electric meters, the rise in prices of various commodities and deterioration of law and order. 																								The AGP has also planned a demonstration at Dispur Last Gate tomorrow to highlight the governments alleged failure to handle these issues. 																								The Opposition worked out the joint floor strategy during a meeting convened by the AGP and the government finalised its strategy at a cabinet meeting this evening. 																								Assembly sources said it was unlikely that the Saikia panels report would be tabled on the first day of the session itself. But report or no report, the first days session will be packed with action for sure. 																								The Opposition intends to move an adjournment motion seeking to discuss several burning issues, including Dispurs alleged failure to properly rehabilitate flood victims. 																								This will be the first session of the House under Chandra Mohan Patowary as the leader of the Opposition.																								AGP (Pragatisheel) president Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, while coming down heavily on the Gogoi government for politicising the report on secret killings, had yesterday alleged that the Congress government and Ulfa were hand-in-glove. 																								This was more than evident, Mahanta claimed, after the Assembly elections, when Ulfa issued a statement that the Gogoi government was not keeping its promise after regaining power.

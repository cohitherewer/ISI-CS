				 Sex worker to cabbie, thank Renuka

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 
				 	 Renuka: Out of the box
																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: Indias sex trade victims may soon get an opportunity to drive taxis, work at beauty salons and nurse the aged instead of living a life confined to rehabilitation homes. 
																								In a departure from convention, the Centre has decided to try out-of-the-box ideas to tackle the problems such women and children face in spite of several traditional schemes. 
																								Its time we tried different tactics. Why should women rescued from trafficking be restricted to being trained to sew or do some dastkari (a Rajasthani handicraft)? We want to train them to drive cabs, work in beauty parlours and nurse the aged, women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury said. 
																								The ministry has been granted a specific allocation for innovative ideas under the 11th five-year plan, which will be used to implement programmes that were not possible before, sources said. 
																								Confirming the innovative ideas project, Chowdhury said she wanted to enlist corporates to assist her with the initiative. 
																								The minister has already met industry leaders once  earlier this month  and will soon meet them again. 
																								In a separate meeting to be held in January, Chowdhury said she would ask fast food giants like McDonalds, Dominos and Pizza Hut to use their reach to help reduce crimes against girls and women. 
																								They can splash our messages on the paper mats and trays used to serve burgers, fries and pizzas, Chowdhury said. 
																								Her comments were made in the context of the central governments plans to celebrate International Womens Day  March 8  next year in a grand manner. 
																								We will not celebrate just one day, but the whole of March. We want these fast food companies to join us... to use their popularity to help us, she said. 
																								The messages could be in the form of warnings against foetal sex determination or could urge parents to keep girl children in school till the age of 18, Chowdhury said, clarifying that she was citing possible examples. 
																								Earlier this month, Chowdhury handed 56 Mumbai women keys to taxis they now own and drive. 
																								The women rescued from trafficking can also work in old-age homes, taking care of the elderly. We will tie up with the Red Cross society, she said. 
																								Several rescued women have been forced to return to the sex trade because of lack of funds to support their families.

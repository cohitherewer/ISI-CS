				 Dhoni cuts a smart face
 							 - Team India ODI skipper comes home OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Homecoming of the idol. (PTI)																								Ranchi, Oct. 24: Next time Ranchi Rambo leads the Indias ODI squad to Islamabad, Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf might not go gaga about Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 																								For, his famous locks have disappeared. 																								The fans of Dhoni here were also taken aback by his new look on his maiden arrival here this afternoon after lifting the World Twenty20 Cup. 																								Its another matter if people liked his new haircut or not, but the missing locks certainly became the talk of the town today.																								The jury was divided. The new short and black hair-do of Dhoni was welcomed by some of his fans while few claimed the Team India ODI skipper was imitating Bollywood stars. 																								The long hair which he used to don before was better, said Sukant, a Dhoni fan from Shyamali Colony area in the state capital. 																								But one of Dhonis close companions differed. 																								Bahut smart dikh raha hai, bal kata liya hai, jhakas look hai, (he is looking very smart after a new hair-cut. His looks are irresistible), said the companion claiming that now he would change his hairstyle. 																								No prizes for Dhonis companions new style. His preference would be none other than the new Dhoni cut. 																								Hair-dressers at Kaya, the parlour which Dhoni usually visits for a hair cut, said the new hair-do can be more or less termed as point cut  short hairs managed without combing. 																								Earlier, Dhoni used to keep straightening cut of long hair. But now he looks smarter, said Dheeraj Lal, the director of Kaya, who today visited the airport to have a glimpse of Dhoni. 																								Even as cricket fans and mediapersons thronged the airport in large numbers to welcome Dhoni home, none from the government could make out time to receive the real hero. 																								The scribes could not meet Dhoni for special bytes, though. Dhonis brother-in-law Gautam claimed before them that Dhoni gone to sleep soon after his arrival from airport. 																								Sources said a programme would be organised at the chief ministers residence tomorrow at 11am to honour Indias pride. 																								Good sense prevails!

				 Maken lands in capital
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Sept. 30: State Congress has kept their fingers crossed as a change in their units leadership turns imminent. 																								AICC general secretary Ajay Maken arrived in the capital this evening by a service flight to review the party organisation here. On his maiden visit to the state after assuming the charge of Jharkhand affairs, Maken will be holding a one-on-one meeting with party members tomorrow. Insiders said he is meeting senior leaders, including Speaker Alamgir Alam, tonight.																								He is believed to have already received necessary feedback from his predecessor Noor Bano and senior leader Harikesh Bahadur. Makens report to the Congress high command will determine the fate of state president.																								The Congress central leadership has been quite unhappy with the state of affairs. The party members here have been at loggerheads on wide-ranging issues, including extending support to the Koda government. State president Pradeep Balmuchus efforts to hold the flock together went in vain. Mass resignation by partys office bearers in Simdega, including district president Niel Tirkey, who also represents Simdega in the Assembly compelled the Congress for a re-think. Jharkhand affairs in-charge Noor Bano was replaced last week.																								Maken is energetic. He will objectively analyse the ground realities. I have already conveyed my feelings to the party high command, others, too, will put forward their views to Maken, said Tirkey.																								Sources added that though Congress was not in the mood to disturb the Koda government now, it was convinced a change in the partys state leadership was necessary.

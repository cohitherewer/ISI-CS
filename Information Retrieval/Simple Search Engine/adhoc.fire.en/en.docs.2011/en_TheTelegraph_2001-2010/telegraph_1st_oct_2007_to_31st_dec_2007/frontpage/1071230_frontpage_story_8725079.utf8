				 Gogoi plea to call off bandh

 															- Poll jitters for Cong after Gujarat, Himachal debacle
 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Guwahati, Dec. 29: Jolted by Congress defeats in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today appealed to organisations who have called bandhs and boycotts during the panchayat elections to withdraw their agitation. 
																								The appeal comes just two days before the first phase of the polls on Monday. 
																								Six communities seeking Scheduled Tribe status have called a bandh on Sunday and Monday, while two influential students organisations, the Assam Tea Tribes Students Association and the All Adivasi Students Association of Assam, have boycotted the polls.
																								The Joint Adivasi Action Committee, which yesterday called an indefinite economic blockade in Assam, Jharkhand and Greater Jharkhand from January 27, is also supporting the poll boycott.
																								Gogois appeal is being seen as a last-ditch attempt by Dispur to get the agitation programmes withdrawn as they have the potential to hamper the prospects of the ruling Congress. So far, the government was giving the impression that it was not bothered by the bandhs and boycott.
																								With the Congress faring poorly in Gujarat and Himachal, the party has to take all possible steps to ensure that it does well at the hustings. Losing the panchayat polls will have an adverse impact on the partys prospects in the next Lok Sabha polls, a senior party leader admitted.
																								With the All Koch-Rajbongshi Students Union (Biswajit Rai) temporarily withdrawing its 1000-hour Assam and North Bengal bandh called from January 1, Dispur is hoping that an open appeal may cut ice with the others as well. 
																								The appeal also comes a day after the Unified Commands strategy group discussed law and order in the state. 
																								Gogoi issued the appeal before campaigning for the first phase ended this afternoon and he left for New Delhi. He will return tomorrow.

				 CBI probe into Ram killing
 BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA 																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: The CBI is in the process of registering a case and starting investigations into the death of kidnapped FCI executive director P.C. Ram.																								Three months after he was kidnapped, Ram was killed in a heavy exchange of fire between the police and Ulfa militants near Guwahati in July, causing much embarrassment to the state government. 																								CBI sources said Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi had asked the Centre for a CBI inquiry. 																								We have received the notification and are in the process of registering a case, a CBI official said.																								The case became murky when a body was dug out in Baksa district and identified by his son Prabin Gautam as that of his fathers. The body was taken to Ghaziabad and cremated on July 2, but Ulfa issued a statement saying Ram was still alive. 																								A man claiming to be Ram also called his family in Ghaziabad to say he was alive. This set off fresh operations by the security forces, and the subsequent exchange of fire in which Ram was reportedly actually killed.

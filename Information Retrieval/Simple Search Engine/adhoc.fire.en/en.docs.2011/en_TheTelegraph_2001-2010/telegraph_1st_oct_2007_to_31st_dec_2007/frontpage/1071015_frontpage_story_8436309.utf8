				 A case for second post-mortem
 KINSUK BASU AMP; SANJAY MONDAL				 	 Rizwanur Rahmans mother Kishwar Jahan breaks down on Id at her home. Recalling how she used to celebrate the occasion with her son, she asked: My son was murdered. The chief minister has promised to punish the killers. But will he? Picture by Amit Datta																								The CID has promised to solve the mystery over Rizwanur Rahmans death by next week, when it submits its final report. Although CID officers were tight-lipped about the findings, sources in the department have told The Telegraph the report will conclude Rizwanur had committed suicide.																								The CID says it will take into account the statements of a large number of people as well as circumstantial evidence, but the report will hinge critically on the post-mortem findings.																								Discussions with forensic experts, however, have revealed that the process followed during Rizwanurs post-mortem  and the environment in which it was carried out  were inadequate if not flawed (See below).																								So, exhumation of the body and a second post-mortem are necessary to solve the mystery. Rizwanurs family yesterday suggested that to the chief minister and he promised to ensure exhumation within a day once a magistrate gave permission.																								Such permission is routinely given if the state government makes a request.																								The available information on the contents of the post-mortem report, and the process that led to its preparation, suggests the government should immediately file a request for exhumation.																								Details about the post-mortem:																								Date and place																								On September 22 in the police morgue at NRS Medical College and Hospital																								Done by																								Dr S. Batabyal of the hospitals forensic medicine department, with the help of doms																								Contents																								Confidential, but The Telegraph has been told about some of the key findings:																								A running train hit Rizwanur and killed him																								Deep injury marks at the back of the head																								Some injury marks around the shoulders and elbows																								Head partially severed and loosely attached to body																								Ideal environment																								A morgue should be as clean as an operation theatre, forensic expert A.K. Gupta said. The norms say a post-mortem should be carried out in almost the same atmosphere as that in which surgery is done on a living person.																								To ensure this:																								Bodies should be preserved at 4C																								Dissection hall and surrounding rooms should be air-conditioned																								Powerful lights should be provided over the dissection tables																								Hall should be clean with adequate water supply																								Ideal process																								A few basic steps:																								Get a thorough inquest report from police																								Take pictures, close-up and from a distance																								Note internal and external injuries  their position, size, depth and direction																								Videotape the post-mortem examination in controversial cases																								Carry out histological (tissue) and chemical examination whenever required																								Preserve the viscera																								Visit the spot where body was found and examine tracks and the rake that supposedly hit the body																								Gaps in Rizwan case																								Inquest report not available																								No pictures taken																								Post-mortem not videotaped																								Spot not visited, rake and tracks not examined																								Flaws at morgue																								Temperature not maintained at 4C at NRS morgue																								Lights inadequate																								Cleanliness inadequate																								Doctors overburdened. A single doctor handles most of the 4,000 bodies, at an average of 13 bodies each working day. Sometimes, a second doctor helps out																								Dr Gupta, the forensic expert, said the post-mortem infrastructure was inadequate. I had asked for changes last year as an MD examiner, but it seems nothing has been done, he said. I had spoken to a doctor who confessed he had carried out 10 post-mortems in two hours. That works out to 12 minutes for each body. When I asked him how, he fumbled for an answer.

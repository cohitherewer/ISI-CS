				 Action against one dad, not Todi
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Manoj Jaiswal at the STAR Ananda studio on Tuesday 																								Calcutta, Oct. 2: Salt Lakes police have promised to do what Calcutta police failed to in the Rizwanur Rahman case: act against a businessman who lodged a false complaint against a son-in-law he didnt approve of.																								The Bidhannagar (South) police will start a case against Chandra Prakash Tulsyan for his complaint that his minor daughter Dolly had been abducted by Manoj Jaiswal, who had married her at a temple last week.																								Yesterday, Manoj and three relatives were arrested but freed on personal bonds past midnight after their lawyer produced Dollys school-leaving certificate that suggests she is 20.																								We shall start a case under Section 211 (false charge of offence) of the IPC against Chandra Prakash, said North 24-Parganas police chief Supratim Sarkar.																								Calcutta police never acted against Ashok Todi who, too, had accused Rizwanur of abduction when Priyanka left home after their marriage at a registrars, though he didnt say his daughter was a minor.																								Officers had three times spoken to the couple at Lalbazar, admitted to Rizwanur his marriage was legal, and struggled to persuade Priyanka to return to her fathers home for a few days.																								Senior officers who didnt wish to be named said it was obvious the police knew from the start that Todis complaint was false, but they colluded with him.																								After receiving Todis written complaint, the police could have registered a case against Rizwanur and begun a formal probe. Instead, in the guise of trying to find out if the complaint was true, officers went about trying to coax the couple to separate, a senior detective said.																								Another officer said Todi could have been charged under sections 211 and 182 (false information with intent to cause a public servant to use his lawful power to cause injury to another). He said it could be done even now.																								Manoj and his three relatives will appear before a Salt Lake magistrate tomorrow when the case against them is expected to be dropped.																								Bidhannagar (South) police, who had arrested Manoj even after being shown a photocopy of Dollys age certificate, face a harass- ment complaint from the Jaiswals.

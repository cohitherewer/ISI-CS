				 Razi power shock
 RANJAN DASGUPTA																								Ranchi, Nov. 28: In a severe embarrassment for the Madhu Koda government, Governor Syed Sibtey Razi today refused to put his seal on the appointments of the two head honchos of the state-run Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited. 																								Razi has returned the file concerned without endorsing the appointments of energy secretary Aditya Swaroop as TVNL chairman and Vikrama Ram as managing director of the power utility. Ram is at present the Dhanbad area manager of JSEB.																								While the TVNL chairmans post has been lying vacant for over a year, the post of the managing director has been without an occupant since October this year. The appointments, made on November 19, had been a key demand of the Congress in its wish list handed over to chief minister Madhu Koda earlier this month. The appointment of Swaroop was seen as a snub to the Congress, which was believed to be eyeing the chairmans post. 																								TVNL functions under the Companies Act. Under this, it is the governor who is the appointing authority for the board of directors of the company, including the chairman and managing director. 																								Sources in the energy department said Razi had taken exception to the fact that the state government had appointed the energy secretary as TVNL chairman. The reason being that sometime ago, Razi had agreed in principle to the governments suggestions to make the state development commissioner the TVNL chairman. Razi has asked the state to explain why it suddenly shifted from its earlier stand and appointed the energy secretary, said an official. 																								On Rams new posting, Razi has questioned whether he has the necessary expertise that an MD needs to look after power generation. 																								Swaroop said the government was working to reply to the governor on the queries that he has raised. We are deliberating on the issue and the reply would be sent after approval of the chief minister.

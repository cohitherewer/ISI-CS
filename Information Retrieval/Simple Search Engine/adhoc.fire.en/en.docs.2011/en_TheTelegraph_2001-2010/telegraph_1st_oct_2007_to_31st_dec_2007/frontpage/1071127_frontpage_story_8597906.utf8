				 2-pronged strategy by CPM
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 26: The Bengal government today remained tight-lipped about Taslima Nasreens possible return but the CPM held meetings in minority-dominated localities criticising her for hurting religious sentiments.																								Before the partys state secretariat decides on Thursday if Taslima can return, the CPM has sounded its leaders in minority areas and been told the situation is still tense. 																								A Muslim district committee member from Park Circus said a good section of the CPMs minority supporters had joined Wednesdays street violence demanding the authors expulsion.																								Public speeches by CPM leaders suggest a two-pronged strategy. While the CPM has officially put the ball in the Centres court, arguing that Taslimas visa was beyond the Bengal governments scope, its leaders have been distancing the party from her before the minorities.																								Secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty insisted that neither the government nor our party forced Taslima to leave but was silent on the CPMs stand on her return. We communists are secular but we do not believe in hurting (religious) sentiments. If somebody does it, its a crime, he said.

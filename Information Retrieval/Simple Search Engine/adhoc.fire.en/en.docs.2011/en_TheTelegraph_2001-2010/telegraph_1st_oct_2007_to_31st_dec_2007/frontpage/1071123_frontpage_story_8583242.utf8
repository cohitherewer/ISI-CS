				 Idris and Sultan face party music 
 BARUN GHOSH 				 	 Idris Ali (top), Sultan Ahmed				 																								Calcutta, Nov. 22: The Congresss Idris Ali and the Trinamul Congresss Sultan Ahmed face action from their parties for their roles in Wednesdays street mayhem.																								Idris, president of the All India Minority Forum, belongs to the Congress. Ahmed is a Trinamul general secretary. 																								The leadership is contemplating action against Idris. Although he does not hold any key post in the state unit, he was a former general secretary of the partys minority cell and is still a party man, state Congress general secretary Jayanta Bhattacharya said tonight.																								Bhattacharya said state leaders had met to discuss possible action and that senior leaders in Delhi, including Mohsina Kidwai, the general secretary in charge of the Bengal unit, had been informed of Wednesdays agitation. 																								The chief of the partys minority cell, S.M.S. Hyder, said Idriss role in the trouble must not be lost sight of. 																								Our partys image has suffered because of Idriss involvement. 																								Idris appeared hurt that moves were under way to dump him. Everybody knows that the Congress is backing my forum. But today, party leaders are disowning me. This is not expected from them, he said.																								Ahmeds fate, though, seemed to have been already decided.																								Sultan should not have declared that his boys were among the rioters. After yesterdays incident, he cant hold a key post like that of a general secretary, a Trinamul source quoted Mamata Banerjee as saying.																								M. Nur Uzzaman, who replaced Ahmed as chief of Trinamuls minority cell two years ago, said the general secretary had tarnished the partys image by declaring that he sent his boys when the trouble broke out yesterday.																								Uzzaman was also upset with Ahmed for skipping a working committee session of the party on November 15 to attend a public meeting with Siddiqullah Chowdhurys Jamait Ulema-i-Hind, which has been campaigning for the cancellation of Taslima Nasreens visa. 																								Ahmed, however, insisted that he had done nothing wrong. 																								The trouble broke out in many parts of my Entally area. So, many of my boys had joined yesterdays movement spontaneously to demand cancellation of Taslimas visa, he said.

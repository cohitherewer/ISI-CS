				 Buddha to wield broom  - DCP duo first, Prasun next
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTCalcutta, Oct .7: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is expected to set in motion a clean-up of Calcutta police with the removal of two deputy commissioners linked to the Rizwanur Rahman case.																								The sweeping changes could eventually ensure the easing out of Prasun Mukherjee as police commissioner, sources said.																								Deputy commissioners Gyanwant Singh and Ajoy Kumar, accused of threatening Rizwanur and wife Priyanka Todi, could be shunted out as early as this week, the sources said.																								The government is waiting for the report of the CID, which examined the two officers yesterday. The two are learnt to have fumbled several times and some of their answers were at variance with the depositions of others.																								The CID report will give the government the administrative excuse it is looking for to initiate action against the officers. If the CID submits a report on Monday, the transfers will follow immediately. 																								The government will also closely follow the developments in the high court, which is expected to hear a petition for a CBI probe tomorrow. 																								Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray, who was in Delhi yesterday, is likely to get the necessary clearance from the Union home ministry for action against the IPS officers.																								The chief minister had last week told Jyoti Basu that two officers would be removed but did not want to rush into administrative actions vulnerable to legal scrutiny.																								When Basu said two have been removed, it was assumed that he was referring to assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das.																								But, the sources said, the chief minister is convinced of the complicity of the senior officers in interfering in the marriage of two consenting adults. The unlawful incidents could not have taken place without the patronage of the police top brass. Bhattacharjee is keen to ensure sweeping changes so that Calcutta police are cleansed, a source said.																								Nobody, either in the party or the police, will be spared, the source added.																								Such a resolve means commissioner Mukherjee will not be spared. The sources said Mukherjee could be replaced before or after the Pujas. 																								Bhattacharjee discussed the issue with Basu this morning.																								Top cop at Gangulys																								Mukherjee, who is also the Cricket Association of Bengal chief, tonight went to the Behala complex where Sourav Gangulys house is located. Police sources said Mukherjee was there for about an hour.																								Souravs brother Snehasish, who had last week said he introduced Ashok Todis brother to the police chief, lives in the same complex. The CABs working committee meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.

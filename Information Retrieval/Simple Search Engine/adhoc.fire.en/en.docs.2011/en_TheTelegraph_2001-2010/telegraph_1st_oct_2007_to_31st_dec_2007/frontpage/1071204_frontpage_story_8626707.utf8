				 Veil off query that drove Dilip away
 							 - Letter reveals Pawars Calcutta question; chief selector felt like dirt  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 India was 141 for 2 at the end of the fourth day of the Eden Test, after taking a 160-run first innings lead. Indias hopes lie in Harbhajan Singh (in picture), who completed a five-wicket haul on Monday, and Anil Kumble, who took three. MS Dhoni exuded confidence, saying: We need just 10 balls, so in a way, five hours is too much time. Picture by Santosh Ghosh 																								Dec. 3: More than one reason contributed to chief selector Dilip Vengsarkars sudden departure from Calcutta on Saturday, but the proverbial last straw was when BCCI president Sharad Pawar questioned him on whether hed been denying colleagues the opportunity to watch international matches.																								According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, Vengsarkar (the lone selector in town) felt like dirt and decided enough was enough. The president-elect, Shashank Manohar, was present when Pawar raised that question.																								Instead of humiliating a former captain and one of Indias batting greats, Pawar shouldve asked for the duty roster of the past 15 months, both at home and overseas, and made his own judgement.																								Vengsarkar has, in fact, mentioned that question bit in his lengthy letter to Pawar (a copy of which reached this newspaper from a top source in the BCCI) and added that three of his four colleagues confirmed they hadnt complained.																								The letter, however, hasnt talked about Vengsarkars reported differences with secretary Niranjan Shah over his son Jaydevs selection at the India A level. Nobody will go on record, but there appears to have been a spat over Shah Junior.																								Vengsarkar is absolutely firm on not continuing as chief selector unless the BCCI unconditionally revokes the recently introduced guidelines applicable to the selection committee.																								Vengsarkar has made that clear in his letter and, unless the guidelines are withdrawn, hes not proceeding to Bangalore for Wednesdays meeting, a confidant said.																								Speaking this evening, he added: Vengsarkar, though, wont be sending his resignation till the president has replied to his letter, which was sent last night. Courtesy demands that a formal reply be given.	The BCCI, too, has no plans to revoke anything. The guidelines arent only applicable to Vengsarkar.... A code of conduct has to be there and he has to decide whether he wants to continue or not, vice-president Rajeev Shukla said.																								Its almost certain that Wednesdays meeting to choose the squads for the third and final Test against Pakistan and the Test series in Australia will go ahead with nobody in the chief selectors chair.																								However, eyebrows wont be raised if the most seasoned selector, Sanjay Jagdale, is asked to function as acting chairman. Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh (Jr) and Ranjib Biswal complete the committee.																								Biswal tried to broker peace last evening but Vengsarkar didnt take the first step  calling Pawar in New Delhi. Had that been done, Shah wouldve telephoned Vengsarkar.																								As another source put it, Biswal made a sincere effort, but both sides have taken such strong positions.																								Vengsarkars letter is candid and, at times, emotional.																								Besides questioning Shahs penchant for calling meetings to suit his convenience, Vengsarkar has exposed differences within the Pawar group.																								That came through when he quoted Manohar as saying that former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindra was responsible for curbing the selectors freedom.																								I was aghast when Mr Shashank Manohar told me over the telephone yesterday that Mr Bindra is the man behind all these happenings against the selectors... reads part of Vengsarkars letter.																								Things are still fluid, but former captain, selection committee chairman and cricket manager Chandu Borde appears the favourite to become Vengsarkars full-time successor.																								Earlier, in June (after the Graham Ford fiasco), Borde had lessened the BCCIs headache by agreeing to be cricket manager on the long tour of Ireland, Scotland and England.																								Aunshuman Gaekwads name is also doing the rounds. Hes a former opener, coach and selector.

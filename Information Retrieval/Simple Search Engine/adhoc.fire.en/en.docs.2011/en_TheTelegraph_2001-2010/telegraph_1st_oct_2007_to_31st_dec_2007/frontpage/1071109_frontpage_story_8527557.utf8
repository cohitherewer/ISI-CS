				 Parking space notice to malls 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Nov. 8: The Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) has slapped a show-cause notice on three shopping malls in the capital asking them to explain why they have left insufficient area for parking in a city gasping for space.																								The malls  Pantaloons, Big Bazaar and The World  have been given 15 days to reply to the civic notice. 																								The Bhubaneswar authority has questioned the lack of space before the malls and the space allotted by each for parking. According to procedure, the mall management can either reply back to the civic board within 15 days or request for an extension of a maximum of two months. 																								If it does not get a reply by then, the BDA can cancel the building plan, which would mean the three would then be treated as unauthorised constructions. 																								Following this, the BDA may lodge an unauthorised proceeding case against the management. A quasi-judicial body would then hear the case and decide on regularisation methods. 																								If no alternative is found, the mall would have to be demolished, explained sources at the BDA. 																								At present each mall management is using their individual underground parking area as storage spaces. The parking area before each complex is small and it gets difficult to accommodate all vehicles, which causes them to spill on to the streets. 																								There are two options open for the management  either they vacate the underground parking area and allow the public to park their vehicles there, else they go in for roof-top parking, said Surendra Behera, member (planning) of the BDA. 																								While BDA remains the plan approving authority, the BMC is the trading licence issuing agency. 																								We did not think of the problem because the place was initially given out to smaller business establishments who later sold it off to the mall management, said Behera. The malls were inspected before the notices were sent, he added. 																								Fed up with the frequent congestion and traffic problem, the city traffic police had recently requested the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) to initiate legal action against the malls.

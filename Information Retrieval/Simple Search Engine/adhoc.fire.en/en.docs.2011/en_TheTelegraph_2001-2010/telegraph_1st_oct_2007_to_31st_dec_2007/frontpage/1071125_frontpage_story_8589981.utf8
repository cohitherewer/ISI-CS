				 Former CMs urge Razi to fire govt
 							 - Governor gets list of charges against ministers OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Nov. 24: In a rare coincidence, former chief ministers Arjun Munda and Babulal Marandi today urged Governor Syed Sibtey Razi to dismiss the present state government. 																								The leaders used different platforms to fight for the common cause, though.																								Marandi, while attending a meeting of United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA) in Vijaywada, asked the governor to pave the path for the mid-term polls by dismissing the Koda-led government. 																								Munda, on the other hand, today submitted a 34-page chargesheet against chief minister and his 11 ministers to the governor with other BJP leaders and sought immediate dismissal of the government.																								Maintaining that the fresh mandate was the only option left in the present scenario, the main Opposition demanded Razi to order a probe into the misdeeds of Koda and his colleagues.																								The prime target of the BJP in the chargesheet was Koda. Eight pages were devoted to enlist the charges against him. 																								Koda is the boss, so he has to face the blame for the sordid state of affairs. In many cases, we have just indicated. It is for the probe agencies to nail the ministers, Munda said.																								The BJP has also castigated the Congress, RJD and JMM for sharing the booty collected by the Koda government and blackmailing the chief minister to further their personal interests. BJP state unit chief P.N Singh headed the delegation to the governor.																								The BJP lambasted Koda for preferring the small and dubious companies than the reputed ones for the mining lease. Companies like Tata Steel, Jindal South West, Essar got prospecting licence lease, while Core Minerals and Bhushan Steel got direct leases for iron ore blocks. The BJP also charged that illegal mining, smuggling and export of iron ores was rampant in Chaibasa under the chief ministers patronage.																								The saffron brigade said the crime graph reached an all time high in the first four months of the year. 																								The BJP nailed Kodas colleagues, too. The government was mute on the intelligence agencys list of the ill-gotten wealth of rural development minister Anosh Ekka, it alleged. Water resources minister Kamlesh Singh has been accused of causing a heavy loss to the exchequer by giving extension to the licence of a liquor trader five times. 																								Drinking water minister Chandra Prakash Chaudhary has been accused in the chargesheet of indulging in corruption in awarding tenders for various water supply schemes, while HRD minister Bandhu Tirkey has been charge with shielding the contractor committing irregularities in the construction of the National Games complex.																								The rejection of health minister Bhanu Pratap Sahis proposal to release Rs 68 crore to a consultancy firm by the health secretary has come in handy for the BJP to put him in the dock. 																								Land reforms and revenue minister Dulal Bhuiyan has been accused of illegally transferring tribal land in his wifes name.																								Agriculture minister Nalin Soren and welfare minister Joba Manjhi, too, are facing a large number of charges.

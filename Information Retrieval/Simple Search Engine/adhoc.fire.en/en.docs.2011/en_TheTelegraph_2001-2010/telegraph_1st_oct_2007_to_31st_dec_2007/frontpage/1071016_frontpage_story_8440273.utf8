				 CID digs out suicide call 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rizwanur																								Calcutta, Oct. 15: The CID today claimed to have found a missing link that establishes Rizwanur Rahman committed suicide, a conclusion that could prompt the government to take action before the Pujas against police officers.																								We have spoken today to a person who was vital to our investigations. The media will be told about the investigation shortly and it will come as a major surprise to many, CID special inspector-general Niraj Nayan Pande said, refusing to elaborate.																								However, other officials said the missing link was a student of Class XI whom Rizwanur used to tutor. Some minutes before Rizwanur died, he had called her up to say he would not be teaching her any longer, an official claimed.																								Such a statement shortly before he died indicates that he intended to take his life, the official said. Otherwise, why should he suddenly tell her that?																								The official said this was the vital information the CID needed to establish the suicide theory, though the agency has not examined the body.																								But Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur said he was not aware that the computer graphics teacher gave private tuition to anyone after he got a job. My brother had stopped going to work two weeks before he died. Why should he inform only one student that he wont be teaching her any more?																								If the vital information makes it to the impending final report and the case is treated as suicide, the police will still stand accused of driving a young man to death.																								The government seems to be keeping that possibility in mind. Action can always be initiated against the police officers prior to the Pujas. There is nothing to prevent anybody from doing that, home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said after holding discussions with chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb.																								Ray said he was expecting the CID report by tomorrow or day after. A viscera report usually takes six months to one-and-a-half years. But we asked the authorities to work on a war footing. I hope to get the viscera report before the Pujas, he added.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had called on Rizwanurs mother on Saturday, held a meeting with Deb and Ray today. 																								Asked whether it had been decided to initiate action against the officers, Bhattacharjee said: You will come to know if such a decision is taken.

				 Army to restore peace 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 
																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 30: Opposition parties today demanded immediate deployment of army in Kandhamal and sought the governors intervention to ensure protection of life and places of worship in the district, even as the administration claimed that normality was limping back to the district. 
																								Addressing a press conference at Phulbani, the headquarters of Kandhamal district, revenue divisional commissioner (RDC) Satyabrata Sahu and IG Pradip Kapoor said all efforts were being made to restore normality. 
																								They said curfew was in force in four sensitive towns and night mobile patrolling was on. Fifty persons involved in communal violence had been arrested and cases had been registered against 35. Three companies of CRPF, three units of specially-trained Special Operation Group and 25 platoons of state police have been deployed, said Kapoor. 
																								A delegation of six Opposition parties comprising the Congress, NCP, CPI, CPI(M), Samajwadi Party and RJD met Governor M.C. Bhandare at Raj Bhavan today after being prevented entry into the troubled district yesterday. A delegation of Christian organisations, led by president of Global Council of Indian Christians Sajan K. George, today met the governor and demanded a CBI probe into the riot. 
																								They also urged for adequate and immediate deployment of central para-military forces, compensation to the injured and survivors of riot victims, rehabilitation of riot victims and publication of a white paper on rehabilitation measures. 
																								George also appealed to Puri Shankaracharya Swami Nischalananda Saraswati to call upon the people in Orissa to restore peace in Kandhamal district where three people were killed and several houses and churches gutted during the recent communal violence.

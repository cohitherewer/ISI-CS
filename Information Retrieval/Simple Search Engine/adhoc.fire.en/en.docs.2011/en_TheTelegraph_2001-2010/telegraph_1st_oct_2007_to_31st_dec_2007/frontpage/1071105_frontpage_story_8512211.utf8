 A STAFF REPORTER																								Guwahati, Nov. 4: Guns are at the ready and security personnel on alert for the India-Pakistan One-Day International at Nehru Stadium here tomorrow.																								Moreover, most people have heaved a sigh of relief at the news that Ulfa has welcomed the hosting of the match in Guwahati.																								Security personnel were seen in every nook and corner of the stadium and its surrounding areas.																								The two hotels, where the two teams have been put up, resembled fortresses under the thick security cover.																								Army personnel with sniffer dogs had conducted a thorough check of the stadium this morning.																								The check was followed by a meeting between ICC match referee Roshan Mahanama, deputy inspector-general G.P. Singh, city senior superintendent of police Surendra Kumar and Assam Cricket Association officials. The former Sri Lankan batsman was said to be satisfied with the security arrangements.																								We have taken all possible steps to ensure a smooth game. We have learnt our lessons from the crowd trouble that occurred during the last India-England ODI in 2006. Besides security personnel in uniform, we have also installed an invisible security ring and have a joint control room comprising the police, district administration and ACA officials, who will be manning the public address system to keep the fans posted about any development, Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner Avinash Joshi said.																								Policemen in tracksuits ringed the two teams when they came to the nets in the afternoon. 																								B. Borooah Road was closed to vehicular traffic till the teams were safely inside the stadium. No fans, except those with valid passes, were allowed inside. 																								Even journalists were barred from entering the stadium during the practice session.

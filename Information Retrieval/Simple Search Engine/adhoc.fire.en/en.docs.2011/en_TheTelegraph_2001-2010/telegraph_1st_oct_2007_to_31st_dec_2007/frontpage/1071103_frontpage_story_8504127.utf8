				 Commissioner for capital
 															- Behera appointed for Bhubaneswar-Cuttack OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Bhubaneswar, Nov. 2: The police commissionerate system was introduced in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack today with the nomination of an IPS officer in the rank of an inspector-general as the commissioner. 																								Senior officer Binay Kumar Behera was nominated as the first commissioner for the two cities. 																								A notification to this effect would be issued soon. 																								Behera, a 1982 batch IPS officer of the Orissa cadre, is presently heading the state-run Orissa State Road Transport Corporation (OSRTC). 																								Known as an upright officer, Behera has led a sick OSRTC to recovery path. 																								Decks were cleared for the introduction of the system after Urban Police Bill-2003 received the presidential nod. 																								Two officers in the rank of deputy inspector-general would be appointed as additional commissioners to assist the commissioner. 																								Besides, two superintendents of police (SPs) would be appointed as deputy commissioners. 																								The government would decide the extent of power to be delegated to the commissioner and his deputies from time to time.																								A high-power committee comprising of three to four senior police officers will be constituted soon to thrash out the modalities and structure of the system. 																								The committee would visit Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and other cities where the police commissionerate system was in vogue. 																								Peripheral police stations like Jatni, Khurda, Balianta, Chandka, Cuttack Sadar, Barang, Choudwar and Jagatpur, besides all the police stations under the twin cities, will come under the jurisdiction of the police commisionerate system, with headquarters at Bhubaneswar.

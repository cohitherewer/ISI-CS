				 City youth in UP blasts net

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Calcutta, Dec. 29: A 27-year-old youth was jolted out of sleep at his Baranagar home last night and arrested for allegedly ferrying explosives for the chain blasts in Uttar Pradesh courts last month.
																								Aftab Alam Ansari was picked up in a joint raid by sleuths of the Bengal CID and the Uttar Pradesh special task force, who claimed he had single-handedly carted the entire load for the Lucknow, Varanasi and Faizabad blasts that killed 15 persons.
																								The sleuths were not able to put a figure on the quantity of explosives he carried, but about 2.25kg RDX was used in the Lucknow blast alone. He is suspected to have had a hand in the 2006 Sankatmochan temple blasts, too.
																								Ansari is an important link as he not only ferried the explosives but was present in Uttar Pradesh when the blasts took place. He played a key role in the planning and execution of the November 23 operation, an STF officer said. 
																								Ansari, who married in March, is a wing commander of Harkat-ul Jihadi Islamis sleeper cell working from his Cossipore Road home, sources said. His name was spilt by blast suspects Mohammed Khalid and Tariq who were arrested from Barabanki railway station last week.
																								After the CID smelt out Ansari, the sleuths sent his photograph to the STF to make sure they were on the trail of the right person. Then the STF team decided to come to the city.
																								The STF had provided us vital information and accordingly the raid was carried out, said Rajeev Kumar, special IG, CID.
																								Calcutta-born Ansari is fluent in Hindi and Bengali and has cleared the higher secondary exams. He had joined a private power supply company three-and-a-half years ago after his father died.
																								He joined Harkat some four years ago on one of his visits to Gorakhpur and was sucked into the network. On most occasions, explosives have come from across the border, the STF officer said.

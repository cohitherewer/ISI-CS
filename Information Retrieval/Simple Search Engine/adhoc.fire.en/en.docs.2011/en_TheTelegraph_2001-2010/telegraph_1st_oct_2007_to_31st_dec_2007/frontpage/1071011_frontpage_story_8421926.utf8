 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Oct. 10: The CID is promising to resolve the mystery over Rizwanur Rahmans death by next week when it will submit a report to the state government. 																								CID sources said the agency was veering round to the view that it was a suicide, matching the suggestion in its interim report. The final report was not expected to make a dramatic departure but the government could ease out some officers once it is filed.																								CID inspector-general P.

Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, who made an unscheduled visit to Delhi yesterday, said cricket  not the controversy  was the reason for his trip. I had gone to Delhi to meet board president Sharad Pawar over renewal of lease of Eden Gardens. I got a call and had to rush within short notice, Mukherjee told The Telegraph. 																								But Mukherjee confirmed that he met the chiefs of the CBI and the Intelligence Bureau. It was just a courtesy visit, he said amid speculation that a hunt is on for a face-saver post.

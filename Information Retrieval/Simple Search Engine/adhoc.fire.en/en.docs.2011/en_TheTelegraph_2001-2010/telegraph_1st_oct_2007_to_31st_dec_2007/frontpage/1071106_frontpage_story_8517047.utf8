				 Sachin not keen to be Test captain
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI								 Sachin Tendulkar returns to the pavilion after being given lbw and (above) MS Dhoni plays a shot during the match in Guwahati. India won by five wickets. Captain Dhoni was declared Man of the Match. Pictures by Eastern Projections 																								Guwahati, Nov. 5: Mahendra Singh Dhoni is set to be Indias next Test captain as Sachin Tendulkar, widely seen as the frontrunner, is apparently not keenon doing the job for a third time.																								The post has been vacant ever since Rahul Dravid decided not to continue, around seven weeks ago. Sachin had been his deputy during the Test series in Bangladesh and England. 																								My understanding is that Sachin is not keen and has made that known to some people. So, Dhoni looks the favourite. Its a plus that hes already the ODI and Twenty20 captain, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.																								Speaking on Monday evening, the source added: Its not just about continuity, but Dhoni has been doing very well in the ODI and Twenty20 format. He was superb today too (in the opening ODI against Pakistan) and deserved the Man of the Match award.																								A confirmation couldnt be got from Sachin, the sports seniormost pro and ambassador No. 1, as calls to his hotel room went unanswered right through the evening.																								Sachins first innings as captain was from August 1996 to December 1997 and, next, from August 1999 to March 2000. While the selectors removed him the first time, and brought back Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin himself ended innings No. 2. 																								The selectors  chairman Dilip Vengsarkar, Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh, Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal  are to meet in Mohali on Thursday, during the second ODI, to decide on the Test captain.																								Theres speculation that the appointment could be till the end of the 2007-08 season, next April.																								While Dhoni is the new frontrunner, assuming that Sachin actually isnt keen, there could be some discussion on Anil Kumbles credentials. Our most successful Test captain, Sourav Ganguly (who isnt quite the establishments blue-eyed boy), may also be talked about.

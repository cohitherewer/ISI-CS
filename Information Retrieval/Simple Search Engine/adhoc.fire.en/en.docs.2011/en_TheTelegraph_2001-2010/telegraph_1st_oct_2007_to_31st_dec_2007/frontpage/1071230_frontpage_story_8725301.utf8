																								Dec. 29: Benazir Bhutto is not being allowed to rest in peace even in death.
																								The Pakistan government today offered to exhume the former Prime Ministers body for an autopsy after her party rebutted its claim that she was killed neither by bullets nor shrapnel.
																								Authorities had said Bhuttos head was smashed on her cars sunroof lever by the force of Thursdays blast in Rawalpindi, triggered by a suicide bomber who first fired at her. But the Pakistan Peoples Party insisted she had died of a bullet injury in the head.
																								The government is trying to say she concussed herself, which is ludicrous. Its really dangerous nonsense, said Sherry Rehman, a close aide who prepared the former Prime Ministers body for burial.
																								The PPP also dismissed as a planted story the government allegation that al Qaida-linked militant Baitullah Mehsud was behind the assassination. Mehsud himself threw the charge back at Islamabad.
																								We dont strike at women, the militants spokesperson said. This was a well-planned conspiracy carried out by the intelligence agencies, army and government.
																								PPP sources said Mehsud had earlier told Bhutto through emissaries that he was not involved in the October bombing of her convoy, for which too the government had blamed him.
																								Islamabad rejected calls for a probe by an international body. But it said its own judicial inquiry, to be headed by a high court judge who will be chosen in consultation with Bhuttos husband Asif Ali Zardari, would be completed within seven days.
																								Its not clear if the PPP would agree to an exhumation, virtually unprecedented in living memory for any leader of her stature. The controversy, however, may not have arisen had Zardari not gone ahead with the burial without a post-mortem.
																								She (Bhutto) has a bullet wound at the back of her head on the left side. It came out the other (side), Rehman said. That was a very large wound, and she bled profusely through that. She was even bleeding while we were bathing her for the burial.
																								She alleged the government was trying to cover up something or absolve itself of charges of denying Bhutto proper security. Another motive could be to try and dim the martyrs halo around the former Prime Minister by passing her death off as a mishap.
																								The clashes sparked by the assassination continued today with the death toll reaching 44, raising doubt if the January 8 elections can be held. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has met Zardari and PPP leaders to urge them to join his poll boycott.
																								In Sindh, masked gunmen killed a man shouting pro-Bhutto slogans and the security forces shot dead two other PPP activists as a mob tried to storm an oilfield.
																								Focus on will
																								Zardari told the BBC his wifes will would be read out to a PPP meeting by their son Bilawal Bhutto, 19, tomorrow.
																								Asked if he wanted to lead the party, Zardari replied: It depends on the party and it depends on the will.

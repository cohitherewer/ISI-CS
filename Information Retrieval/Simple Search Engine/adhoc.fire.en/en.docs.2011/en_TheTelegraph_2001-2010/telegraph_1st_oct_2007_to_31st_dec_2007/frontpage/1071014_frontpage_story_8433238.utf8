				 State tourism set to rock
 															- Concert to promote Jonha Falls, educate rural kids SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA 				 	 Jonha Falls: Fresh lease of life																								Ranchi, Oct. 13: Cricket and calypso made Caribbean islands popular on tourism map. Taking a cue from the land of Vivian Richards, a rock concert would be organised here tomorrow to promote Jonha falls, barely 45km from the capital. 																								Eight rock bands under the Jharkhand Rock Music Association (JRMA) would be performing at the Jonha concert to be held tomorrow at a city hotel as a part of promoting rural tourism.																								Besides promoting tourism, the concert would help meet the educational and medical fees of around 100 children of the villages dotting the Jonha waterfall. 																								JRMA president Ajit N.J. Horo said there are at least 20 rock bands in the state capital alone, and eight of them would rock tomorrow. 																								Chief general manager of Nabard K.C. Shashidhar, the patron of the JRMA, said: The concert is a part of our plan to promote rural tourism. We initially decided to call it peace rock concert, but later changed its name to bring Jonha falls, a tourist spot, in the limelight. So, we have sought support from tourism secretary N.N. Sinha. Similar concerts will be organised at other tourist spots too.																								A tourist visiting Jonha could witness how self-help groups (SHGs) and farmers club function, he said, explaining the multi-faceted nature of rural tourism.																								The Nabard chief general manager said the concert would give local talents, most of who happen to be tribal youths, an opportunity to showcase their skills. The good performers might be sent to Mumbai or Calcutta for further enhancement of their skill, Shashidhar said. 																								Besides promoting tourism and spotting talented youth learning to rock, charity is another goal of the concert. 																								We will be seeking donations from the music lovers during the concert. The funds generated thereby will be used to meet the educational and medical expenses of 100 children, he said.

				 Capital air link to Pink City
 OUR CORESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Oct. 22: With MDLR Airlines introducing a Delhi-Jaipur connecting flight today, the Pink City gets connected with the Jharkhand capital by air.																								Jaipur has now been added to the sector in which the airline already operates the Ranchi-Delhi flight.																								We are the first one to connect Ranchi with Jaipur by air. No other airline operating from Ranchi at present connects Jaipur, Koustav M. Dhar, the vice-president of MDLR Airlines, told The Telegraph over the telephone.																								The 70-seater Avro RJ-70 Jaipur-Delhi flight would take off from Jaipur for Delhi at 6.15am and land at Birsa Munda Airport in Ranchi at 10.30am. It then leaves for Kolkata. On its return journey, it leaves Ranchi at 2pm. The Delhi-Jaipur connecting flight is scheduled to reach Jaipur at 7pm. Through its new venture, the airline company aims to tap the business-class tourists of Jharkhand. It would operate on all days except Sunday.																								An MDLR official, Vikash, said that passengers from Ranchi headed for Jaipur would have to buy two tickets, first for Delhi and then again for Jaipur at a total price of Rs 5,500. However, the return journey would cost Rs 3,200 as one would need to buy a single ticket for flying to Ranchi from Jaipur. 																								Dhar said a Ranchi-Bhubaneswar service flight would be started within a month.

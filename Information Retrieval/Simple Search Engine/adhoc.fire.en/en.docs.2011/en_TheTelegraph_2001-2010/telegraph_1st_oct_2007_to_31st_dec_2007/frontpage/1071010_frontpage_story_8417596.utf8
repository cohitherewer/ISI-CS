				 Behind smiles, Sonia sits with nuke button 
 															- Govt gains time but faces tough choice  MANINI CHATTERJEE 				 	 Karat and Lalu in Delhi. (PTI)																								New																							 Delhi, Oct. 9: The faade of bonhomie between the government and the Left was on display today with a joint committee scheduling its next meeting for October 22, but the uncertainty over the coalitions survival will not go away till Sonia Gandhi takes a final call. 																								In the next few days, she will have to decide whether to put the Indo-US nuclear deal on the backburner or give a green signal for negotiations with the IAEA, well placed sources indicated today.																								At their meeting with Sonia on Monday evening, CPM leaders Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury made it clear that the government had only two options: to save the government and forget the deal or lose both the government and the deal. The third option  of losing the government but saving the deal  would not be feasible.																								If the government tried to exercise that option by going to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Left would immediately pull the plug, rendering any international negotiations politically untenable even if constitutionally valid, it was conveyed.																								The third option is being pushed by powerful sections within the government who want to seal the India-specific safeguards agreement before the government gets into election mode.																								Their calculation is that once the safeguards agreement is in place, the deal would be kept alive even if the next two steps  the Nuclear Suppliers Group waiver and the US Congress vote  are not completed.																								More important, they argue, if the government desists from going to the IAEA it would spell a complete surrender to the Left, and the Manmohan Singh government would be at the mercy of the communists for the rest of its term. 																								The Congress has to decide whether it prefers to survive that way or go in for early elections, a government source said. 																								The sources conceded that it was not an easy decision for the Congress chief to take. 																								On the one hand, most party MPs as well as important allies such as Lalu Prasad, Sharad Pawar and M. Karunanidhi are against early polls and would much rather put the nuclear deal on the backburner than risk the withdrawal of the Lefts support.																								On the other, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has placed his prestige on pursuing the deal and any reneging would harm Indias credibility in the world outside. 																								Both sides are exerting pressure on the Congress leadership and it is not yet clear who will win.																								Sonia did not reveal her cards to Karat and Yechury last night. The meeting, sources said, had not been held at the behest of Sonia but at the request of the CPM leaders. They had sought an appointment to personally convey to her the party central committees decision on the nuclear deal issue.																								The CPM leaders underlined that the Left was not at all keen on early elections and felt it would not serve the interests of either the UPA or the Left or indeed the country. However, their aversion to polls did not mean any change of stance vis--vis the nuclear deal.																								The government should not take the next steps in a hurry and this included starting formal negotiations with the IAEA. In case the government ignored this warning, the CPM and its allies would have no option but to withdraw support.																								Sonia, sources said, gave a patient hearing and promised to get back to the Left within a few days. Neither side wants the uncertainty over the governments survival to carry on indefinitely, the sources added.

				 Mob justice for Ulfa extortionist
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Guwahati, Oct. 1: A mob lynched one of the lynchpins of Ulfas notorious 28 Battalion a day after it triggered four blasts in Upper Assam, killing five persons and damaging two oil and gas pipelines.																								Mangal Singh, a sergeant major in the battalions B Company, and two accomplices were trying to intimidate a panchayat member into paying them a huge amount of money when residents of 1 Joraguri village in Golaghat district caught them and delivered mob justice.																								By the time a police team reached the village from the nearest town, Dergaon, the villagers had taken out their anger on Mangal and his accomplices  Monikanta Sare, a conduit for Ulfa, and Ganesh Pegu, a surrendered militant. The police took the trio to Dergaon Civil Hospital, but Mangal could not be revived.																								The incident occurred in the house of AGP member Sajal Chakraborty, who had received several calls from a stranger  he identified himself as one Amrit Goswami  before Mangal came calling. 																								Chakraborty, a councillor of the Paschim Brahmaputra Anchalik Panchayat and owner of a restaurant in Dergaon town, told The Telegraph that the caller wanted to meet him to discuss important things. I asked him to come over today for a discussion on the issue, whatever it was. I was slapped twice without any provocation, he said.																								Mangal and his accomplices reached Chakrabortys house on two motorbikes around 9am. The Ulfa militant entered the house and asked for the panchayat member while his accomplices waited at the door. 																								When Chakraborty identified himself, Mangal slapped him twice and demanded a contribution to the Ulfa coffers. When the panchayat member retaliated by grabbing him by his shirt, the militant whipped out a pistol from his pocket and fired two rounds.																								The bullets missed Chakraborty by a few inches, the police said.																								As Chakrabortys family members shouted for help, neighbours who were alerted by gunshots converged on the house and caught Mangal and his accomplices. It was a free-for-all after that, a police officer said from Dergaon. 																								The police have no record of Monikantas involvement with Ulfa but investigators believe he has been a conduit for the militant group.																								On Ganesh, the officer said he surrendered about three years ago but did not mend his ways. He has been a nuisance, involved in fights and drunken brawls in and around Dergaon town. 																								Sources said Chakraborty recently had an argument with Ganesh over a market lease in Amguri. Ganesh may have sought Mangals help to get even, they said. 																								He and Monikanta were shifted to Golaghat Civil Hospital from Dergaon after Mangal died. Monikantas condition was stated to be critical. 																								An Italy-made pistol, Rs 5,000, four mobile phones and as many SIM cards, as well as a sheaf of extortion notices were found on the extortionists.																								Mangal, who was from Senaichouk village near Pulibor in Jorhat district, joined Ulfa in 1993 and played a role in several incidents of subversion in Jorhat, Golaghat and Karbi Anglong districts. He was arrested once in 2004 and booked under the National Security Act, but jumped bail. He was since on the polices most-wanted list.																								Ulfas 28 Battalion has been Ulfas strongest weapon in Upper Assam, masterminding almost all blasts and attacks on civilians and security forces in the area. Yesterdays blasts in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts came after a period of relative calm.																								Militants surrender																								Seven Ulfa militants, including a woman cadre, surrendered before the army at Laipuli in Assams Tinsukia district on Monday. They did not deposit any arms and ammunition.																								Two Ulfa linkmen were apprehended by 21 Jat Regiment from Jhagrarpar in Assams Dhubri district on Monday. One pistol and some blank notepads of the outfit were found on them.

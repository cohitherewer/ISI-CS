				 Water hope for state by 2008 end
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Water woes																								Bhubaneswar, Oct. 23: Orissa is expected to get its share of irrigation water from Subernarekha inter-state irrigation project by 2008 end. 																								This was revealed at a meeting, chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik here, to review the progress of the inter-state irrigation project. 																								Subernarekha is an inter-state river flowing through Jharkhand, Orissa and Bengal. Under this agreement, water will be shared by the three states in the ratio of 71 per cent, 27 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. 																								On the Jharkhand side, construction of the Chandili dam and Galudih barrage on the upstream of Subernarekha and 90 per cent earthwork has been completed, officials in the state water resources department said. 																								However, this inter-state irrigation project is still incomplete as the Jambhira barrage and canal system on Jharkhand-Orissa border is yet to be completed. A sum of Rs 140 crore was spent on the construction of the barrage and canal during 2006-07. An estimated Rs 253 crore will be spent this year, said state water resources secretary Aurobindo Behera. Of it, Orissa will provide Rs 105 crore to Jharkhand this fiscal to complete work on its side. The project from Jharkhand is expected to be complete by December 31, 2008, so that Orissa is able to get irrigation water, said Behera. So far, construction of a 46km canal on Orissa side has been completed and the project is expected to be commissioned by 2009-10. 																								An estimated Rs 3,500 crore will be required for completion of the project, out of which Rs 1,756 crore will be made available under Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme of Central government. Orissa has so far spent Rs 466 crore on the project, said the EIC.

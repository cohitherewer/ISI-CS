				 Girl in knots gets political knock
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Dhanbad, Oct. 7: The controversy over the claims of Shilpi Agarwal of Digwadih, Dhanbad, being married to Prashant Upadhyay deepened with politicians being involved intervening in the matter.																								While local Shiv Sena leader Shakuntala Mishra arrived at the Jorapokhar police station from the girls side to enquire the genuineness of the whereabouts of the boys family, Upadhyays family members contacted Vijay Upadhyay, the Samajwadi Party state president in Calcutta.																								Upadhyay is the boys paternal uncle, the family claimed.																								Today was the third consecutive day for the girl at the police station, where she is staying with a lady constable. The boy was directed to go to Dhanbad where, along with his family and friends, they have put up at a hotel in Hirapur.																								We have to wait for a Delhi High Court order on October 22. The girl had to be kept back as she is not ready to go. She would be going to the court tomorrow and from there she might be sent to the Nari Niketan till a decision is taken, said an inspector of Jorapokhar police station, Bharat Ram. 																								A petition would be given to the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) to get a direction from the court over the girls custody, her family said.																								The police, however, were unable to intervene as the girl is not ready to give anything in writing.																								The girls family, meanwhile, has raised suspicion for the boys family and trade.																								He does not look to be from a good family. We also have doubts about his mother being real. She does not resemble her son. We are waiting for further legal advice from lawyers and the court verdict, said Shilpis father Jagmohan Agarwal said.																								He added that his daughter had been lying all through.																								She had not told us anything about her affair before and has been changing her versions from time to time. We cannot hold her back if she wants to go but we must ensure that the boy will be able to keep her well, said Agarwal.																								The fact that Basant and Shobha Upadhyay had not got their 32-year-old eldest son married yet and that Prashant had been staying with a 55-year-old uncle, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay, in a two-room flat at Bholanath Nagar in New Delhi have raised suspicion.																								Prashant denied all allegations against his family.																								We are a respectable family. Since my lawyer duped us with invalid marriage certificates, things came to such a pass. Today, the police also misbehaved with us, he said.

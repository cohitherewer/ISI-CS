				 Braver than most men, says Imran

																								Mumbai, Dec. 28: On the cricket pitch and political ring, Imran Khan has encountered no small list of tough men. But few could beat Benazir Bhutto for sheer guts.
																								Imran, however, was not remembering the assassinated leader as a formidable political opponent but as a friend from their days in Oxford over three decades ago.
																								She was a braver and bolder woman than most of the men I know, said the former cricketer, who arrived in Mumbai last evening on a private visit. I am still in a state of shock.
																								Asked to describe his personal memories of the former Prime Minister, Imran said Bhutto was deeply affected when Pakistans former military ruler, Zia-ul Haq, hanged her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1979. She was a different woman before and after the hanging.
																								Imran, who is staying at the Juhu house of socialite friend Parmeshwar Godrej, said he had learnt about the attack after his flight landed in Mumbai. His first reaction was not political  he said his heart went out to Bhuttos three children.
																								Today, he asked President Pervez Musharraf to step down over the assassination and said a caretaker government formed by consensus was the only way forward.
																								Musharraf is to terrorists what a red rag is to a bull, Imran said. The longer he stays, the more terrorists you are going to have.
																								Imran, who heads the Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, has been a staunch Musharraf critic and was beaten up and jailed for some time during the emergency.
																								We (the Opposition) hold Musharraf responsible (for the assassination). When Benazir arrived in Pakistan in what was perceived to be an America-backed plan to fight terrorism and the power-sharing deal, she was immediately under threat. Everyone knew she was under threat. People who were targeting Musharraf were going to target her.
																								He cited how Musharraf himself had survived two assassination attempts and required a convoy of 70 vehicles, empty streets and helicopter surveillance when he stepped out.
																								Knowing that she was a target (after the first suicide bombing), why was she not provided with similar security?
																								He said Musharraf must restore the judiciarys independence by reinstating Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and allow political parties to form a national government by consensus.
																								Benazir wanted an independent inquiry (into the first suicide attack) and called for foreign investigators. She wanted to find out why the streetlights were switched off (during the Karachi bombing). How can there be an independent inquiry when 60 per cent of our judges have been sent home? Imran said.
																								He described the scheduled January 8 election as a sham, saying most Opposition parties would boycott it.
																								Imran will return to Lahore tomorrow.

				 Vanishing act stumps IAF
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Dibrugarh, Oct. 14: Noktempong Jamir, 26, showed no sign of a man who could possibly disappear from a training programme. 																								The Indian Air Force, with which Jamir is a flight lieutenant, is as befuddled as the youths family in Nagaland by his sudden disappearance from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu on October 5.																								A resident of Mokokchung district, Jamir is posted at the Mohanbari airforce base in Dibrugarh. He left the base on October 1 for a training stint in Coimbatore. 																								Airforce sources said Jamir went to Dimapur by train on October 2 and stayed there with a friend. The next day, he went to Guwahati and took a flight to Coimbatore.																								Jamir also reported to the officers mess on the two subsequent days (October 4 and 5) for his meals, but after that there has been no news of him. We do not have any clue as to what has happened to him or where he has gone, a source said.																								The airforce reported Jamirs disappearance to the civil and police administration in Tamil Nadu almost immediately. 																								We have sent special teams from our vigilance and intelligence units to investigate the matter. We are very concerned about the whole issue. The family has also been informed, Group Captain Rajan Kapur, the station commander of Mohanbari base, said over phone.																								The airforce has, however, yet to report Jamirs disappearance to the Dibrugarh district administration officially. Neither has it filed any report with the police here. We did not file a report here since the incident took place in Tamil Nadu. However, let me assure you that everything possible is being done to trace the officer. We have informed Jamirs family about his disappearance, and a cousin of the officer, who stays in Mumbai, is in Coimbatore and is assisting the police and the IAF find him, the station commander said.																								The airforce has ruled out any possibility of abduction.																								But certain sections of the IAF are sceptical. 																								We cannot rule out anything at this juncture. We are getting regular updates on the investigation which is being carried out by our agencies and the civil administration there, a source said.																								Jamir, in fact, did his four-year course in engineering from Coimbatore before applying for the airforce. The officer has many friends in Coimbatore. We believe that we will be able to find him soon. We also have complete co-operation of the police there, the station commander added.

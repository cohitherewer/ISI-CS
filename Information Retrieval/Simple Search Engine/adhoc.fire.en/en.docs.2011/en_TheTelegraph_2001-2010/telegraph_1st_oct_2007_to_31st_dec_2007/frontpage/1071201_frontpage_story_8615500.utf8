				 MADHURI MAGIC? WONT WORK ON MAYA
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Nov. 30: Uttar Pradesh has banned Aaja Nachle and sought a countrywide blackout, hours after Madhuri Dixits comeback film was released in theatres across the country today. 																								Shailesh Krishna, principal secretary to the chief minister, said the bar followed complaints that the title song denigrated a particular caste. 																								The reference to the caste is not only objectionable and humiliating but also unconstitutional and, therefore, the screening of the film has been banned in Uttar Pradesh, he said.																								The chief minister (Mayavati) has written to the Centre for a countrywide ban on the movie, Krishna added.																								The director of the film, Anil Mehta, later said he was willing to delete the controversial words. 																								The film-makers are alleged to have poked fun at the cobbler caste in the line, Bole mochi bhi khud ko sonar hai (cobblers, too, are calling themselves goldsmiths). 																								Representatives of weaker sections had approached Mayavati to clamp the ban.

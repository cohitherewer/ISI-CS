				 Debate over Ekka feast 
 															- Minister in fix over goat slaughter on Gandhi Jayanti SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA 				 	 BJP workers stage a dharna at Gandhi Chowk against Anosh Ekka for allegedly taking part in a non-vegetarian party on Gandhi Jayanti. Picture by Gautam Dey																								Ranchi, Oct. 3: A feast, purportedly of mutton, on Gandhi Jayanti has landed rural development minister Anosh Ekka in a spot. 																								Ekka, not unknown to controversy, has triggered howls of protest for allegedly being party to slaughtering a goat and eating it on the Mahatmas birthday, declared International Non-Violence Day by the UN. 																								Ekka was in his ancestral village, Pakartand, 18km from Simdega, to witness the final match of a football tournament. The sports event is better known as Khassi tournament where a goat (khassi) is up for grabs as trophy for the winners. 																								The minister was there along with superintendent of police M.P. Lakra and deputy development commissioner C.P. Bakhla. 																								Ekka, however, denied that mutton was served after the tournament. Instead, kofta and other vegetables were on the menu, he claimed. The minister also alleged that it was a bid to malign the image of the poor tribals. In fact, I did not even touch the goat which was given as the winning trophy, he said.

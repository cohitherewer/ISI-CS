				 Hush hunt for suicide note
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 23: The CBI is looking for a suicide note that the agency feels Rizwanur Rahman might have left behind.																								Although a murder case has been started we have got information that he left a note before his death. We are probing all angles, a CBI officer said. 																								One of the persons questioned by the agency hinted that Rizwanur had prepared a note detailing his miserable condition after Priyanka Todi returned to her parents house in Salt Lake on September 8. 																								The purported note is different from the first person account Rizwanur had submitted to the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights.																								The person told us that Rizwanur had described in the note how police harassed him to leave Priyanka. He had also written down how frustrated and depressed he was at not being able to talk to his wife and how lonely he was, another CBI officer said. 																								We are trying to confirm whether he had left behind any such note.																								A disclosure by a member of Rizwanurs family today seemed to corroborate the officers statement. The family member said that while questioning Rizwanurs relatives yesterday, the CBI officers had asked them to search their houses for the note.																								They asked us several times to look for any suicide note he might have left behind. We told them that it was not true but they appeared very adamant, the family member said. We were told not to tell the media about it. 																								The CBI officers also asked Rizwanurs family members yesterday why they thought it was a case of murder and not suicide.																								This was the first question they asked me yesterday. I told them that if he had planned to commit suicide on railway tracks, he would have done so near his house. I told them my brother was mentally prepared to fight a legal battle to bring his wife back, Rukbanur, Rizwanurs brother, said.																								A CBI officer said the agency was also trying to find information on Rizwanurs state of mind during the last few days before he died. We got to know that he had spent several nights at an undisclosed location. This is very important to the case, the officer said, suggesting that the case was still open.

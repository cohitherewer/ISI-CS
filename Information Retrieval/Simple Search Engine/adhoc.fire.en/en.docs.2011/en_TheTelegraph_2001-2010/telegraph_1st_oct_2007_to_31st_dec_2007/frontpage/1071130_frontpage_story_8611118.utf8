				 Mumbai lands a goldmine 
 OUR BUREAU																								Nov. 29: The Maharashtra Assembly today agreed to repeal the states urban land ceiling law, freeing an estimated 25,000 acres of vacant private land for housing in land-scarce Mumbai.																								The move comes following the Centres refusal to provide funds under the urban renewal mission to any state that hasnt lifted the urban land ceiling. But Bengal, which too has such a law, today said it hadnt yet made up its mind.																								Once a committee hands in a report, the decision will be taken by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee who had a year ago said he was against lifting the ceiling to prevent land-grabbing by promoters.																								Maharashtras move to lift the 31-year-old, 10-acre limit for individuals and trusts could lower real estate prices, some analysts said. The market price of the entire freed-up land is estimated to be Rs 2,00,000 crore. 																								The Bengal urban development minister said the state had time till 2012 to revoke the ceiling before the central funds were cut off.

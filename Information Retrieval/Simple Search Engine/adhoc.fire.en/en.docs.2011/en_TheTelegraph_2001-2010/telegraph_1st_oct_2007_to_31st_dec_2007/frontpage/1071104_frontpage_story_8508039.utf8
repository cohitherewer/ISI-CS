				 Govt on ad path to trace top cop
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Nov. 3: Having failed to trace and arrest the suspended additional director-general (home guards and fire services), B.B. Mohanti, the government has decided to contact him over newspaper advertisements.																								A senior official of the home department said an order to this effect had already been passed and the notices would be issued shortly. He will be asked to come out and respond to the charges framed against him. We hope he will respond to our notice issued through newspapers. If he does not, punitive action will be initiated against him, said the official.																								Mohanti was suspended on August 24 after a Rajasthan court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against him for allegedly sheltering his son, Bitihotra, who has jumped parole on December 4 last year while serving a seven-year imprisonment for raping a German scholar in Alwar.																								A week later, Orissa government framed charges against the suspended cop for going on unauthorised leave in a bid to nullify the execution of the warrant. Charges were also framed against him for not giving information regarding his visit to Jaipur on November 20 last year to get his son released on parole.																								Mohanti had also not helped the government in implementing a court order to pay an amount of Rs 50,000 as he stood surety while bringing his son on parole, the chargesheet stated.																								The surety money, however, has since been recovered from the senior IPS officers account. Meanwhile, the government has withheld Mohantis sustenance allowance too, ostensibly to put further pressure on him to surrender.																								However, Mohanti evaded arrest since August and is yet to receive his suspension order as well as disciplinary proceeding charges. The six special squads, constituted under Cuttack SP, have so far carried search operations in Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Puri, Sambalpur, Sompeta, Vishakhapatnam, Delhi, Ranchi and Kanke, but failed to arrest him.																								Orissa government finds itself in an embarrassing position as the Rajasthan police had accused it of not co-operating with them in arresting the senior cop.

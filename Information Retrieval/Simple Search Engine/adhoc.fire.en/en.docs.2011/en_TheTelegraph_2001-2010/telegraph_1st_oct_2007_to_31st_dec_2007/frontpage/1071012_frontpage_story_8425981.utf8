				 Lawyer courts love trouble
 															- In love with magistrate, advocate held for suicide threat VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR				 	 A letter produced by Rajesh Kumar. Telegraph picture																								Hazaribagh, Oct. 11: Cupids arrow pierced the black robes of a 26-year-old lawyer and left him badly bruised as he was arrested and humiliated for expressing his feelings for an unmarried lady judicial magistrate.																								Rajesh Kumar, the lawyer who claimed he was hopelessly in love with the magistrate 12 years older than him and was even ready to commit suicide if he did not win her hand in marriage, was dragged to court like an ordinary criminal, rope tied round his waist. 																								Miffed lawyers demanded the immediate release of Rajesh and transfer of the lady magistrate from Hazaribagh. Sensing that the situation could snowball into an ugly confrontation, senior police officials ordered those bringing him to court to untie him. 																								Chief judicial magistrate B.N. Pandey later granted bail to Rajesh.																								Acting on a complaint from district judge Pradeep Kumar Sinha, the sadar police yesterday arrested Rajesh, who claimed he was in love with the magistrate. 																								Rajesh had written to Sinha and office-bearers of the Hazaribagh Bar association to help him marry the magistrate. Rajesh claimed the magistrate was also in love with him and had even exchanged love letters. 																								The police initially detained Rajesh and tried to convince him not to pursue the woman, who had made it clear she did reciprocate Rajeshs affections. 																								The lawyer, who spent the night in lock-up, proudly proclaimed his love as he was being dragged to court. Jail jane se mera pyaar aur rang layega and mohabbat zindabad. (If I go to jail, my love will blossom), Rajesh told The Telegraph.																								In his letter to Sinha, Rajesh had threatened to commit suicide if he was not helped in his bid to marry the lady. Rajesh claimed he and the woman fell in love a few months ago while taking up cases in her court. He said they even exchanged love letters, but the woman decided to snap ties with him for reasons unknown to him.

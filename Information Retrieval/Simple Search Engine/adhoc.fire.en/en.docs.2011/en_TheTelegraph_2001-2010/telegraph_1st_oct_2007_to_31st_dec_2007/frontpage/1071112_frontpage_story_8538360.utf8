				 Pressure pill for Koda govt
 															- Congress members decide to boycott Foundation Day  OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Balmuchu																								Ranchi, Nov. 11: Congress workers today told their state party president Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu to keep up the pressure on the Madhu Koda government to perform. 																								Balmuchu had organised an informal meeting of about 15 senior party leaders at a guesthouse near Paladu area this afternoon to seek suggestions about the action plan of the party vis--vis the Koda government. 																								We told Balmuchu that workers at the grassroots have welcomed the belated stand that the party has taken against the Koda government. The state leadership must continue to maintain the heat on the government or else the partys image will nosedive further, said a senior Congress leader. 																								For the past nine months, we have been insisting on the state leadership to take a serious note of the manner in which Koda was ruling the state. But these state leaders never gave us importance since they, too, were enjoying power. Now that the high command has become serious about Jharkhand, these state Congress leaders are turning the heat on the Koda government, said another. 																								Balmuchu denied any state Congress leaders involvement in any kind of activity for personal gains. 																								During a press conference at the party headquarters here this evening, Balmuchu announced that the party would boycott Foundation Day celebrations. 																								Instead, the party, led by AICC leader and in-charge of party affairs in the state Ajay Maken, will lead a protest march to Kodas house along with party MPs, MLAs and other leaders. A memorandum would be given to Koda containing the partys suggestions to improve the partys showing. Later, Maken would also meet Koda to express annoyance with the manner in which the government is functioning. Maken is also expected to announce a deadline by when the Koda government should deliver, or else Congress would withdraw its support. 																								Party members will organise a seminar of intellectuals on November 15 to discuss their views on Jharkhand and the role that Congress must play for development of the state, added Balmuchu.

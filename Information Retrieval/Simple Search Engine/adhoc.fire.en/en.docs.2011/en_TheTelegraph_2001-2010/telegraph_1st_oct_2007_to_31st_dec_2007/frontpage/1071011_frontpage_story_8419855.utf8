				 Power shot in the arm for state
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Bhubaneswar, Oct. 10: Orissa, one of the major coal producing states in India, would get a second ultra mega thermal power project to be set up at an estimated cost of Rs 16,000 crore. 																								 The Union power minister, Sushil Kumar Shinde, made this announcement while on a visit to the city to inaugurate a few National Thermal Power Corporation-sponsored eyecare projects here today. 																								Shinde said he had discussed the proposal with chief minister Naveen Patnaik today and he had agreed to it. 																								 The Union minister did not specify the location of the proposed ultra mega power project. 																								However, he said it would be set up somewhere along the coastal belt. 																								This would be the second ultra mega power project in the state. Earlier, a 4,000MW ultra mega power project to be set up in Sundargarh district was cleared by the Centre. 																								Shinde said the entire coal required for the second ultra mega power project would be exported from abroad, while captive coal block had been allotted for the first plant. 																								Land and other inputs like water would be provided by the state government, said the state energy minister, Surya Narayan Patro.																								The Centre has proposed to have 10 ultra mega power projects across the country with a capacity of 4,000MW each to bridge the gap in meeting 11th plan capacity addition target. 																								The government has launched a special initiative for the development of coal-based ultra mega power projects.... 10 such projects have already been identified to boost capacity, said Shinde. 																								We will achieve the 78,579MW power addition target in the current Five Year Plan. The government would invest Rs 10,00,000 crore to achieve the capacity addition target and we would try to cross this target in this plan period, he said.

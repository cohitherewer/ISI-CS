 															- Fake notes racket routed in Jharkhand OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Giridih, Sept. 30: An agent, arrested last night in connection with a fake currency racket, has revealed that the notes are sourced from Pakistan.																								The superintendent of police (SP), Arun Kumar Singh, said the agent was arrested with fake currency worth Rs 17,000 from Barganda. We had been receiving complaints of fake currency being circulated in Giridih since long. For the last fortnight, we were tracing the agent, Prakash Sao, a resident of Kurho village under Jamua block, added the SP.																								The seized currency comprised 26 notes of Rs 500 denomination and four notes of Rs 1000 denomination. Meanwhile, on August 8, another person, Md Akhtar had been arrested with fake currency worth Rs 19,000. 																								Elaborating on how the fake currency finds its way through to the state, the SP added: An international racket is involved in running the racket. Fake currency is being minted in Pakistan and routed through Bangladesh and Nepal before entering Bihar and Jharkhand. These rackets function out of Dhanbad, Bokaro, Hazaribagh, Ramgarh, Jamshedpur and other industrial areas of the state. 																								However, we cannot say that the racket involved has been busted as such gangs function in a pyramidal fashion. So, no one knows the identity of the kingpin, said Singh. 																								The SP said that the fake currency recovered in this case is almost identical to original ones and it was not possible for specialists even to differentiate the notes. 																								Even the chief manager of SBI could not differentiate the notes, the SP said. 																								The arrested told this reporter that he worked on a commission of Rs 50 for every Rs 500. Sao repeatedly claimed that he did not know much about others involved in the work. 																								The SP further claimed that only a handful of other gang members have been identified and they would soon be tracked down. Seeing the sensitivity of the matter, Singh added that they would hand over the case to the crime investigation department (CID) for further investigation.

				 Archers create world record 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 The winning trio. Picture by Bhola Prasad																								Jamshedpur, Nov. 21: Its official. Perhaps for the first time Indian archers have created a world record in the cadet recurve team event.																								The world archery body  Fita International Target Archery (FITA)  ratified this through a letter issued today.																								What makes this victory sweeter is that all the three archers hail from the Tata Archery Academy (TAA). 																								Adona Raju, Rajib Basumatary and Ravindhar Hembrom are the three stars who made the record at the 3rd Cadet World Archery Championship, which was held in Mexico between October 15 and 22 last year.																								The Jharkhand Archery Association received the letter from FITA today. The trio scored 441 out of 480, crossing the earlier record of 438 created by archers from Turkey in the same tournament. Although state archers have beaten the world record earlier, due to some technical difficulties, the FITA could not be informed about it and hence the scores could not be ratified. 																								Sanjeeva Singh, the JAA secretary and Tata Steel sports department chief, said that the scores in both the semi-finals and the finals of the event are added and the grand total is considered the final score. 																								At present, the three archers are taking part in the Junior National Archery Championship, which is being held at Amravati. 																								Officials pointed out that state archer Jhano Hansda, too, had come close to creating a world record on two occasions but it could not be ratified. Meanwhile, local archers won the Asian Championship after 17 years and Jharkhands Paltan Hansda went on to become the world champion. 																								Even Mangal Ho was selected as the brand ambassador for one of the worlds leading security agency. 																								After this achievement, both Vijay Kumar Malhotra, the president of the Archery Association of India and JAA have decided to write to chief minister Madhu Koda and the sports ministry to suitably reward the archers. Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman would felicitate the archers soon, officials said.

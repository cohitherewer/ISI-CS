				 Help for Hillary, from Benazir

 															- US presidential hopeful scores with prompt call for probe
 K.P. NAYAR
				 	 Hillary: Personal gain
																								Washington, Dec. 29: In death, Benazir Bhutto may have done a service to another woman politician in another corner of the globe: Hillary Clinton, who is seeking what is arguably the worlds most powerful job which has so far eluded a woman.
																								Clinton was in serious trouble in the first US presidential primary to be held in Iowa on January 3 to choose the Democratic candidate, but the murder of Bhutto has considerably salvaged her efforts to beat off a challenge from rival Senator Barack Obama.
																								Yesterday, she stole a march over every other candidate in the 2008 presidential race  Democrat and Republican  by being the first to call for an independent, international investigation into Bhuttos killing.
																								Clinton also captured the imagination of American voters, who are deeply suspicious of President Pervez Musharraf, by forthrightly stating that there was no reason to trust the Pakistani government in the investigations on the killing.
																								Clinton also became the first presidential candidate to publicly call for engaging India in the crisis in Pakistan. I just think we have given a blank check under President Bush to President Musharraf, she said on CNN. And the results are, frankly, not in the interests of the US, they are not in the interests of Pakistan, and they are certainly not in the interests of the region.
																								She added: We should begin to try to have an ongoing process that includes India and Afghanistan. A lot of what you see happening in Pakistan is driven by the, you know, very strong concern coming out of Pakistani government toward Afghanistan, toward India.
																								The irony of Clintons call for a proactive role for India is that it is more than what the UPA government has so far been able to say or do over the developments across the border. 
																								Clinton spent most of yesterday travelling across Iowa manipulating voters  cynically, her critics would allege  into thinking that she is the only Democrat candidate who has the international exposure and experience to be in the White House during crisis time.
																								I have known Benazir Bhutto for more than 12 years. She is someone whom I was honoured to visit as First Lady when she was Prime Minister, Clinton said at one meeting in a remark that was typical of what she said during most of yesterday.
																								Hinting at Obamas lack of experience and drawing a subtle comparison to herself as the inheritor of her husbands legacy, Clinton said of Bhuttos death: Certainly on a personal level, for those of us who knew her, who were impressed by her commitment, her dedication, her willingness to pick up the mantle of her father, who was also assassinated, it is a terrible, terrible tragedy.
																								Obama, a mere one-time Senator, was forced to begin every one of his campaign appearances yesterday with a reference to Bhutto. Lacking in experience, he could not be personal, unlike Clinton, about the slain Pakistani leader. 
																								She was a respected and resilient advocate for the democratic aspirations of the Pakistani people, was all Obama could say of Bhutto.
																								A poll in Iowa, held partly a day before Bhuttos assassination and partly on the day of the killing, showed Obama and former Senator John Edwards tied at 29 per cent and Clinton trailing just behind them with 28 per cent support. 
																								Among Republicans, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee was leading with 34 per cent, followed by former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney with 27 per cent, leaving former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani way behind with eight points. 
																								But Huckabee and Romney, with little Washington experience unlike Clinton and little anti-terrorist experience unlike Giuliani, have also been hurt in the aftermath of the Bhutto assassination as foreign policy takes the centrestage in the presidential campaign, at least for now.

				 Cops rely on call details
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jamshedpur, Nov. 3: More than 24 hours after the murder of shoe baron Ashish Dey, police are clueless about his assailants. They are scanning the calls made on his cellphone over the past one month to nail the criminals, though. 																								The police are almost certain that the Deys assailants contacted him over phone before taking the extreme step.																								The call records of the cellphone of Dey will definitely help us unfold the mystery behind the murder. We are hopeful of a breakthrough shortly, said deputy inspector-general of police (Kolhan) Ram Lakhan Prasad, who is camping at the steel city since the murder took place. He said several police teams had been despatched to different cities, including Calcutta, for conducting search operations. 																								The victim, significantly, received a series of ransom calls allegedly from Ulfa demanding a ransom of Rs 5 crore. Although the police and the victims elder sibling Shekhar Dey ruled out the possibility of the Ulfa link to the murder, they could not come up with the name of the probable criminal gang executing the crime.																								Sources close to the murder victim pointed out that Dey might have apprehended such action beforehand. He had become selective about receiving calls on his cellphone over the past fortnight. He had also stopped picking up the landline phone of his showroom in Sakchi and the one in his residence, said a close aide of the Dey family. 																								Meanwhile, the police have started detaining criminals having underworld connections. Ravi Chowrasia, who had earned notoriety for his alleged involvement with the murder cases of transporter T.P. Singh and basketball player P. Ratna Rao (Johny), has been detained in this connection.																								Sources in the district police said there was every possibility of Roshan Ali, a goon from the steel city and alleged linkman behind the abduction of another shoe baron, Parthapratim Roy Burman of Khadims in 2001, might also be involved in the case. 																								The police are also looking into the angle of Deys interaction with the apartment builders, particularly those in Sakchi and Aambagan area.

				 Case cracked, claims officer  - U-turn driver fails to convince agency
 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI																								Calcutta, Nov. 2: An officer today claimed that the CBI had cracked the mystery behind the death of Rizwanur Rahman, but refused to disclose the conclusion.																								However, the officer said the agency was sceptical about the train drivers statement that he had seen someone jumping in front of his train. The driver had earlier told the CID that he had not seen anyone being knocked down.																								Somehow, his body language did not seem to corroborate what he was telling us, the CBI officer said. We have wrapped up the case and have been able to tie up the loose ends. But the drivers body language was not convincing enough.																								Asked when the CBI would file its report in the high court, he said: We have solved the case but investigations will be on. Our priority now is to submit the report to the court within the stipulated time (two months from October 16).																								Terming the mysterious death case a thriller, the officer added that the CBI team had reconstructed the sequence of events on September 21, the day Rizwanurs body was found.																								We have been able to tie up the loose ends by finding out what exactly had happened on that particular day and why Rizwanur left his aunts house around 8.30am. He had gone to Rajabazar to meet someone and, thereafter, many things happened, the officer said.																								Hinting that Rizwanurs phone calls were tapped, the officer said the computer graphics teacher was scared over the past couple of days before his death. 																								He was desperate to talk to Priyanka and wanted to tell her what he was going through but could not, the officer added. 																								The fear of criminals had led him to spend nights at an undisclosed location. 																								During the interrogation of Reyaz, Rizwanurs cousin with whom he was staying before he died, we came to know that he had spent a sleepless night on September 20. He told Reyaz how criminals were following him and he had no idea whether Priyanka would ever return. But at the same time, he had vowed to bring her back, the officer said.																								The CBI has also traced some calls Rizwanur made from his mobile phone on the night of September 20. There were surprise elements but we have been able to reach a convincing conclusion. There are a couple of things to be re-examined and thats why we have been questioning people, he said.																								CBI officers today collected original documents linked to the case from Rukbanur, Rizwanurs brother. 																								We collected all documents, including original copies of correspondence made by Rizwanur to senior police officers, another investigator said. A lawyer is with us and he is going through the papers.																								Other officers described the role of the police as atrocious. We have got the original copies and this would help us nail them, an officer said, suggesting that charges of criminal intimidation and conspiracy could be filed.

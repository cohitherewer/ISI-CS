				 Dibrugarh ASEB staff on strike
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Dibrugarh, Nov. 1: Officers and other employees of the Dibrugarh office of the Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB) began an indefinite strike today. 																								They are protesting against the civil and police administrations failure to arrest some traders who manhandled an ASEB team on Monday. 																								The team, belonging to Dibrugarh Electricity Subdivision 3, had gone to Cole Road in the town to install digital electronic meters on the premises of some commercial establishments.																								A section of shopkeepers and businessmen, described as culprits and criminals by ASEB employees, allegedly assaulted subdivisional officer Ajit Phukon and junior engineer Ranjan Dutta. The traders, on the other hand, complained that the ASEB officials attempted to install digital power meters by force. 																								Both parties lodged FIRs at Dibrugarh Sadar police station. 																								We will intensify the strike if the police do not arrest the culprits at the earliest. We have also demanded permanent security measures at our office and protection for our men who go on field duty, said an employee of the ASEB office in Dibrugarh town. 																								In another incident today, a meter reader of the ASEBs Dibrugarh Electricity Subdivision 2, Laban Gogoi, was manhandled when he went to a consumers residence to take a reading of units consumed. 																								Four persons were picked up in this connection. They were interrogated at a police outpost.

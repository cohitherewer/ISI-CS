				 Blast trail in border
 GAUTAM SARKAR																								Dumka, Oct. 16: Mihijam, the sleepy town in Jamtara district close to the Bengal border, is in the eye of a storm. And a single man, Md Shahid, the owner of electronic shop Sargam Telecom, in the town is in its epicentre.																								Earlier, he was made accused of selling one of the SIMs used in the Mecca Masjid blast in Hyderabad in May. Shahid was taken into custody by a Andhra Pradesh-Bengal CID team and interrogated in Calcutta. He was later set free.																								Last night, a central intelligence team descended upon Mihijam quietly to raid Sargam Telecom, and till filling of this report, were interrogating Shahid. Hemant Toppo, the superintendent of police of Jamtara, said: I have information that a team from New Delhi has arrived at Mihijam. No arrest has been made.																								Local sources in the state intelligence claimed the central team had found a link between the May-18 Hyderabad blast and the terrorist attack at Ajmer shrine on October 11, which conclusively establishes the involvement of the same group behind the two blasts.																								The central team, which was trying to find the link between the two incidents came here in search for the real culprit, they claimed.																								The SIM found in the Hyderabad blast was apparently sold by Shahid in June 2006 without collecting valid documents and identity proof required under the law. He had then that the buyer had identified himself as a taxi driver and produced his driving licence as proof.																								The SIM recovered from the unexploded bomb in Hyderabad had been bought by militants in the fake name of Babu Lal Yadav from Calcutta. It was later revealed that the photograph used as identity proof was of one Dr Tarak Nath, a yoga teacher working in a Noida college. Investigations into the Ajmer blasts revealed that the SIM recovered was also bought in the name of Babu Lal Yadav using the photograph of Dr Tarak Nath.

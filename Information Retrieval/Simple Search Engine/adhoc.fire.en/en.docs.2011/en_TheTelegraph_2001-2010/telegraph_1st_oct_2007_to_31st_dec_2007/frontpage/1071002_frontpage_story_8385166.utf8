				 Congress concern cloud on Koda
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Oct. 1: All India Congress Committee general secretary Ajay Maken, who is also the partys Jharkhand affairs in-charge, today said the functioning of the Madhu Koda government was not satisfactory and that it will have to pay very dearly if it does not mend its ways soon.																								Without fixing any time-frame for the Koda government to perform or perish, he maintained: Suitable actions will be taken by the Congress high command very soon. I am proceeding to Bhubaneswar and would reach Delhi on Thursday. One-year time span is enough for a government to start working in positive directions, he said.																								Immediately after reaching the state capital last evening, Maken met the chief minister at the latters official residence, along with Congress state president Pradeep Balmuchu and CLP leader Manoj Yadav. 																								 We have had enough discussion over the issue. We will be separately meeting the MLAs and MPs. But it is clear that no one is happy with this government. We tried to give good governance to Jharkhand by toppling the NDA, but it has failed to live up to the expectations, said Maken. 																								He refused to reveal what transpired between him and Koda. He also remained tight-lipped on whether the state was heading for a mid-term election or if there was a change of guard in the state unit of the party.																								He apparently expressed concern at the absence of steering and co-ordination committees, and lack of a common minimum programme.																								He added that Congresss ideological commitment of work for welfare of minority communities, too, remained neglected in the absence of financial corporations, commissions and such other bodies. Meanwhile, while inaugurating at Sector IV in Bokaro a showroom of Jharkhand Khadi and Village Industries Board, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief and state UPA convener Shibu Soren today reiterated that his party would contest a mid-term election with UPA partners, but if the situation changed, JMM might even think of putting up its own candidates in all seats. Who knows the future? If growing indiscipline in the UPA goes beyond control, anything can happen, he added.

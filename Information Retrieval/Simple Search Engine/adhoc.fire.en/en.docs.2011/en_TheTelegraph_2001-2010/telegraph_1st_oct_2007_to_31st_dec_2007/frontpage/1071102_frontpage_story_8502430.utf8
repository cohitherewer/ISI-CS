				 Pin prick lands DC in clinic
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 The DC being taken to hospital. Picture by Hardeep Singh																								Hazaribagh, Nov. 1: The deputy commissioner of Chatra, Puja Singhal Purwar, was admitted to Apollo Hospital for treatment after she became unconscious following a pin prick at her official residence around 11am today. 																								She was taken to Sadar hospital at Hazaribagh, but later shifted to Apollo Hospital in Ranchi. 																								The medical superintendent of Apollo Hospital, P.D. Sinha, said: Her condition is stable but she is under observation and tests are being conducted to ascertain the cause behind her discomfort. 																								Purwar, in her early thirties, is presently posted in Chatra as the deputy commissioner. She is the wife of the IAS officer and registrar of co-operative societies, Rahul Purwar. The couple have two daughters.																								Officials at Chatra could not offer any explanation behind the sudden turn of events. 																								According to the information received by the state police headquarters from Chatra, the deputy commissioner felt the prick of a needle in her left hand. 																								She immediately started feeling giddy and fainted. Sometime later, she regained her consciousness. 																								It is still unclear how the needle pricked her. We are awaiting feedback from doctors. If there is need, we will surely probe the matter, said the spokesperson of the state police, R.K. Mallick.																								On if she was attacked by a poison-tipped needle, no one was ready to clarify how anyone could have breached the tight security cover at the residence of the deputy commissioner. 																								Top bureaucrats and police officers, including chief secretary P.P. Sharma and director-general of police V.D. Ram, visited Apollo Hospital in the evening to enquire about her health.																								The Union government had recently praised the IAS officer for developing a model for implementation of national rural employment scheme in Pakur district, where she was posted before being shifted to Chatra. 																								She was invited by the Union rural development ministry to give a presentation on the model to several district magistrates across India.

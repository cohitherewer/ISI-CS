				 Serving life, Dara gets more
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Dara in custody. A file picture																								Bhubaneswar, Oct. 29: Dara Singh, who has been sentenced to life for burning to death Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two sons eight years ago, was today sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a Muslim garment trader eight years ago. 																								Baripada district and sessions judge Sachidananda Sahu today handed out the punishment to Dara on the basis of the statement of a village watchman, who was a witness to Shaikh Rehmans murder at a weekly haat in Mayurbhanj district at Padiabeda in 1999.																								However, the three others accused were acquitted of charges, said Daras lawyer Prabhas Kumar Sahu. 																								Dara is already serving a life term in Baripada Circle Jail for burning Staines and his sons to death outside a church at Manoharpur village in Keonjhar district on January 22, 1999. 																								Singh said he would appeal in the high court against his conviction. 																								After killing Staines, Dara had let loose a reign of terror in the forests of Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar for about a year till he was arrested a year later. 																								Padiabeda and Jamubani are not far from the spot where Graham Staines and his sons were burnt to killed.																								A month ago, Dara and three others were sentenced for life by the same court on charges of killing Roman Catholic priest Arul Doss at a church in the same district. 																								The court acquitted seventeen others accused in the case due to lack of sufficient evidence. 																								Those sentenced in the Doss case included Chema Ho, Raj Kishore Mahant and Jadunath Mahant, who along with Dara are presently in Baripada jail.																								Dara and three others had been convicted of shooting down Doss on the night of September 1, 1999, with sharp arrows at Jamboni village of Mayurbhanj district.																								Doss (35), a native of Tamil Nadu, was the priest of the Anandapur Roman Catholic Church in Mayurbhanj.

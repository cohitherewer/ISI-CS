				 Todi fate in CID hand
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 8: The Bengal government today said Ashok Todi could be arrested and criminal proceedings started against the IPS officers accused of interfering in Rizwanur Rahmans marriage, if the CID recommended it.																								If the CID starts a case or makes any recommendation for penal action against him (Todi), there is no problem in arresting him, home secretary P.R. Ray said.																								So far, no case has been registered against Todi, a businessman and Rizwanurs father-in-law, though the computer graphics teachers brother had filed a formal complaint against him.																								Asked why the government did not ask the local Karaya police station to take the required steps, Ray said: The case is no longer at the police station level as the CID is looking into every aspect of it.																								The home secretary said the CID might summon the city police commissioner, Prasun Mukherjee, if necessary. 																								The political leadership is learnt to have taken a decision to act against the two deputy commissioners linked to the controversy and, at a later stage, the police commissioner.																								But the administrative arm is waiting for the CID to submit its report. The CID is probing the case and that is why the government is awaiting its report. The government cannot pre-determine action during a CID inquiry. So far, no decision has been taken on disciplinary action against the officers, Ray said. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee declined to comment. But former chief minister Jyoti Basu did not mince words, making the commissioners continuation virtually untenable.																								I have never heard such strange comments like that from a police commissioner. We had removed another police commissioner on a different ground earlier, Basu said, referring to Mukherjees controversial media conference. No guilty police officer or anyone else will be spared. 																								Basu added that its still not clear whether the boy was killed or he committed suicide. It was unfortunate  two young and educated people having their marriage end in such a way.

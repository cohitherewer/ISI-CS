				 Court whip on IPS father
 RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR 																								Jaipur, Nov. 15: Declaring him an absconder, a court here today issued a standing warrant against suspended Orissa top cop B.B. Mohanti after the police expressed their inability to trace him within the court deadline of November 15. 																								Mohanti, the former additional director-general of police, has been booked for allegedly helping his rape convict son Bitihotra Mohanti jump parole. The senior IPS officer has been evading arrest since May 28, 2007. 																								Public prosecutor N.D. Sharma told The Telegraph that additional chief judicial magistrate Rajendra Bansal had also issued a standing warrant against the son. 																								The court told the Cuttack collector to prepare a list of property of senior Mohanti for forfeiture. The next hearing in the case would be on January 10, 2008. 																								Rabi Satpathy, inspector in charge of Cuttacks Cantonment police station, who had arrived here earlier, recorded his statements, saying they had been unable to trace Mohanti senior and had carried out searches in various places, including Rourkela, Puri, Sambalpur in Orissa, Bangalore, Andhra Pradesh, Putapurthy, Delhi and Calcutta. 																								The court issued a fresh non-bailable arrest warrant against Mohanti senior on October 3, 2007, till November 15 after the Orissa police had stated that the IPS officer was untraceable. The Rajasthan police went on to file an affidavit before the Supreme Court, accusing the Orissa police brass of preventing Mohantis arrest. Mohanti senior is currently under suspension for helping his son jump parole. Bitihotra was convicted of raping a German student in Alwar, 145 km from Jaipur, in February 2006 and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. 																								After Biti jumped bail in December 2006, his father pleaded ignorance about his whereabouts and so far has refused to cooperate with his counterparts in Rajasthan. 																								Mohanti senior, who signed a surety bond of Rs 50,000 for his son, is accused of obstructing the probe into his sons disappearance.

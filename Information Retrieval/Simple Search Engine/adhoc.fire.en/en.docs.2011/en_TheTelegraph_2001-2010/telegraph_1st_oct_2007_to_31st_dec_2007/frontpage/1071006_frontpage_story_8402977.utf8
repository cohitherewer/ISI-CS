				 Act signal to cautious CM
 BISWAJIT ROY																								Calcutta, Oct. 5: Jyoti Basus comments today reflected the pressure mounting on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee from within the CPM for action against police officers accused of coercion. 																								Bhattacharjees response indicated he would not like to take a hasty decision and would wait for the high courts order. The government seems to be taking an administrative, rather than a political, approach. 																								The way Basu disapproved of commissioner Prasun Mukherjees remarks also sent a signal that the party and the government were decided on acting against the police. 																								Sources said Basu was this morning closeted with Bhattacharjee for a while before the CPM state committee meeting began. Basu apparently got an assurance that action would be take against two officers. But the veteran leader took this to mean that action had already been taken, a source said. 																								At the party meeting, in the face of criticism of the police role, Bhattacharjee said he did not want to be rushed. Its true the polices role and the commissioners defence of it damaged the governments image. But I cant take hasty decisions. We should wait till the high court decides on the petition asking for a CBI probe, a state committee member quoted Bhattacharjee as saying. 																								Party leaders who spoke to Bhattacharjee said they felt he had initially believed the police version, but changed his mind when evidence suggested otherwise. Bhattacharjee will hold a dialogue on the present situation in Bengal with leaders of the minority community on October 11.																								Most members of the state secretariat seemed to favour Bhattacharjees approach. Benoy Konar, another veteran, sought to dispel the impression that Basus words reflected the collective opinion.																								I have no knowledge of any secretariat decision on punishing police officers. If there is any decision, it is administrative. We dont intervene in the governments affairs daily, he said.

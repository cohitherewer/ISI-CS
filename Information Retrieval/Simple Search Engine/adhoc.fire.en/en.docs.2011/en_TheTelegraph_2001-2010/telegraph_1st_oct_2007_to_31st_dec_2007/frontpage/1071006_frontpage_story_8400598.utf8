				 Trial tonic in lynch verdict
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Patna, Oct. 5: Emboldened at its success at taking the G. Krishnaiyah murder case to a logical conclusion, the Bihar government is gearing up to open more special courts to step up the process of speedy trial in the state. 																								The government will move the high court to secure the latters concurrence for opening more special courts and increasing the number of judges at the civil courts. This is to pursue the cases of heinous crime more vigorously, principal secretary (Home) Afzal Amannullah told The Telegraph. 																								At the same time, Amanullah said, the government would not let its guard down in the G. Krishnaiyah murder case. The administration would marshal the facts and place them well in the higher courts to ensure that the convicted persons do not get any reprieve, he said.																								The Patna district and sessions court recently awarded capital punishment to the former MP Anand Mohan and two other don-cum-politicians in the case of murdering the IAS officer and former Gopalganj district magistrae G. Krishnaiyah in 1994. 																								Sources in the police headquarters revealed that the police administration had prepared a list of 21 don-cum-politicians who are involved in the cases of murder and arms act. A few of them are on bail also moving out freely. The administration will try to find out the ways to get their bail cancelled and speed up trail against them, a senior official revealed. The police headquarters have embarked on carrying out fresh perusal of cases against them, sources disclosed. 																								In fact, almost all those convicted in the Krishnaiyah murder case were linked to the ruling Janata Dal. Ironically, the courts verdict punishing them has caused more set back to the Opposition, particularly led by the RJD boss Lalu Prasad than the ruling establishment. 																								The ruling establishment believes that Anand Mohan, Lalganj MLA, Munna Shukla (who has been awarded life imprisonment) and others of late had turned critical to chief minister Nitish Kumar and had been supporting the rebel leader, Upendra Kushwaha, whom the party leadership expelled recently. 																								And these rebels were said to have a strong backing of Lalu Prasad  at work to destabilise the Nitish Kumar government  from behind the scene. Lalu Prasad was trying to use these rebels against the government, a senior JD(U) leader confided. All the accused convicted by the court in the Krishnaiyah murder case belong either to upper caste Bhumihars or Rajputs.

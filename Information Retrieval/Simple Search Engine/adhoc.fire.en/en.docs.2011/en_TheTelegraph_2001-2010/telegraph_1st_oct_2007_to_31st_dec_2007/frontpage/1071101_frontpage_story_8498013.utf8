				 Called back on way to DC chair
 															- Political pressure stops trio from taking charge in Naxalite bastions SUMAN K SHRIVASTAVA 																								Ranchi, Oct. 31: Political pressure has stonewalled the government decision to put at least three extremist-hit districts under the charge of young IAS officers and give impetus to development. 																								The government, in its transfer order issued yesterday, had set a deadline of October 31 for the three young officers  Amitabh Kaushal, Rahul Purwar and Rahul Sharma  to take charge in their new posts as deputy commissioners of Giridih, Garhwa and Simdega, respectively.																								Kaushal, the DC of Garhwa, ironically, was on his way to Giridih to take charge when he was informed on the phone by an official in the personnel department not to proceed to the district where 20 people were massacred by Maoists on Saturday. He was instructed to hand over charge to Rahul Purwar and join the personnel department. Purwar, at present, registrar, cooperative societies, was in Bangalore. 																								According to sources, JMM chief Shibu Soren cajoled chief minister Madhu Koda to stay the transfer of Giridih deputy commissioner Birendra Ram to the personnel department. 																								Soren, sources said, argued that Ram was due to retire shortly, so it would be improper to shift him now. 																								Soren, who could not be contacted for comment, also pointed out that the Election Commission had clamped a stay on the transfer of officers engaged in electoral roll revision. The arguments of a few senior officers that the government should go for post-facto approval of the poll panel did not cut much ice. The electoral roll revision is likely to be completed by January 10 next year. 																								Rahul Sharma too did not join as the DC in Simdega. Rural development minister Anosh Ekka was said to be not in favour of shifting Vinay Kumar Ambashtha, the incumbent. 																								Personnel secretary S.K. Satpathy, however, said the transfers had not been stayed. As of today the transfer order stands and I have information that Rahul Sharma would be joining as Simdega DC tomorrow, he said. 																								Nunulal Marandi, the brother of former chief Babulal Marandi, said the government had neither shifted Giridih SP Arun Kumar Singh nor taken any action against him. Nunulal, who the Maoists claim was their target, blames the SP for not adhering to requests for additional security.

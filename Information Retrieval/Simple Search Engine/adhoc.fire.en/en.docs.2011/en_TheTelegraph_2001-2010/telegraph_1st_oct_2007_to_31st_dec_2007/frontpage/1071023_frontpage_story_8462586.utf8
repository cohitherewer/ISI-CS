 RANJAN DASGUPTA																								Ranchi, Oct. 22: Alarm bells have started ringing among the state police officers following the Palamau polices recovery of over four quintals of explosives. 																								The Palamau police recovered the gelatin sticks after being tipped off by an arrested zonal commander of CPI(Maoist) Ravi, who was nabbed by the Gaya police yesterday. 																								After the arrest, the Palamau police had taken the rebel on remand for questioning. State director-general of police Vishnu Dayal Ram confirmed the seizure of explosives.

The Palamau police found the explosives stocked inside two big, empty water tanks in the residence of a resident of Chak. The area falls under Manatu police station.

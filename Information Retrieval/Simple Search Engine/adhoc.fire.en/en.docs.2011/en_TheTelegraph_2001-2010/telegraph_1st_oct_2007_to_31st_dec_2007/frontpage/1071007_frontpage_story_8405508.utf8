				 Hooliganism spoils varsity poll spirit
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 DSP Sangeeta Kumari tries to persuade students to lift the road blockade. Picture by Srinivas																								Jamshedpur, Oct. 6: A day before the campaigning for the students union polls ends, Jharkhand Chhatra Morcha (JCM) supporters allegedly manhandled NSUI activists and molested girls at a womens college here today.																								According to eyewitnesses, about 20 members of the JCM forcibly entered Jamshedpur Womens College around 11am when the NSUI members were electioneering there. The JCM activists, including several boys, tore apart the posters and banners put up by NSUI and started abusing girls. The crisis reached its peak when a few of the JCM members allegedly started beating up the girls with sticks.																								The students of the college claimed that the boys of JCM molested several NSUI supporters and other union members. The students of the college also alleged that they had put hands on their private parts.																								This is not campaigning, it is hooliganism, said Shabana Parveen, a senior NSUI leader at the college. 																								When we saw them, we tried to close the college gate. But one of the boys pulled the collar of my salwar-kameez and pushed me, said Nalini Sinha, the state general secretary of NSUI. 																								The college students, who blocked the Kharkai link road later, lifted the blockade after city deputy superintendent of police Sangeeta Kumari promised action against the culprits. 																								NSUI members later filed an FIR against senior JCM leaders, including Dhananjay Kumar and Jai Narayan Munda, at Bistupur police station. 																								Shukla Mohanty, the principal of the college, has written a letter to the university grievance cell requesting vice-chancellor to take necessary action, but Munda, the city election-in-charge of JCM, trashed the molestation charge. 																								Plea rejected 																								The high court rejected the petition of Chhotanagpur Law College students Rakesh Kiran, Julian Anand Toppo and Sachin Indivar challenging the decision of the returning officer to debar them from contesting the polls.

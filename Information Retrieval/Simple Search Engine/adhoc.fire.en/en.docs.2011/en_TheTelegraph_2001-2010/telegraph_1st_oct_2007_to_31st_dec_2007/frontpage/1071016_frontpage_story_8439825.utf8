				 Torpa for Mittal mill
 RANJAN DASGUPTA 																								Ranchi, Oct. 15: The Torpa-Kamdara zone, 65km from here, has been recommended for ArcelorMittals Rs 40,000-crore steel mill project. 																								The consultancy firm, Mecon Limited, has found Torpa-Kamdara location as conducive for the company to set up its 12-million-tonne steel plant. ArcelorMittal had engaged Mecon to undertake the feasibility study of the Torpa area. 																								The report prepared by Mecon has been submitted to the company. While 50 per cent of the land for the project falls under Torpa area of the newly created Khunti district, the rest lies in Kamdara area in Gumla district. 																								Mecon has said there is enough land in Torpa-Kamdara area to meet the requirement of the company. Similarly, the availability of water would not be a problem for the steel major. 																								CEO (India) of ArcelorMittal Sanak Mishra refused to comment on the issue since he has not got the report yet. All he was willing to say was that Torpa was on the priority list of the company.

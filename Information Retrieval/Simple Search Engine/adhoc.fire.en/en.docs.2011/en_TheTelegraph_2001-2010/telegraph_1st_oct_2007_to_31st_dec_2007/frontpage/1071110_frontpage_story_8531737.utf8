				 Support for Dey murder suspects
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jamshedpur, Nov. 9: Relatives of suspects in the Ashish Dey murder probe today demanded that those detained either be released or remanded in judicial custody.																								About 10am, about 18 relatives of the suspects demonstrated in front of the office of the East Singhbhum superintendent of police, Naveen Kumar Singh, with the demand. 																								Later, a delegation of the relatives met the superintendent of police.																								The protestors, inclu- ding women, alleged that the district police have been unnecessarily harassing innocent persons in the name of probing the business- mans murder. 																								The police have been in a nabbing spree after Dey, hotelier and owner of Sreeleathers Sakchi unit, was gunned down a week ago. 																								They have picked up about 30 suspects, of which several are from Mango and Azadnagar localities. Those picked up from Mango include, Mohammed Sohel, Mohammed Bhola, Santosh Gupta, Sunil Singh (builder), Sukhvinder Singh, Samir Akhtar and Javed Akhtar.																								One of the protestors said the police have arrested his nephew who is completely innocent. 																								My nephew works in Mumbai and had come here to attend a marriage reception. But the police picked him up in connection with the Ashish Dey murder case, he added.																								The officer-in-charge of Sakchi police station, inspector Surender Singh, said the police have the power to pick up any person on suspicion of involvement in a grievous offence. 																								The inspector, who is also the investigating officer of the murder case, said in case the police find the suspects in custody innocent, they would be released on a personal bond. 																								The bond is an undertaking that the person concerned would appear before the police when called.																								Whatever we are doing to crack the murder is legal, added the inspector.																								Meanwhile, the East Singhbhum police superi- ntendent Singh said he was taking all efforts to solve the case but no breakthrough has come so far.

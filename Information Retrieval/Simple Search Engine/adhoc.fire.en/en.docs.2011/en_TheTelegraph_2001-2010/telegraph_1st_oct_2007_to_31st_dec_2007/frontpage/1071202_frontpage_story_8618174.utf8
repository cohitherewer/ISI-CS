				 Julia chases amp; confronts paparazzi
				 	 Roberts																								Los Angeles, Dec. 1 (AP): Silver-screen sprite Julia Roberts is fed up with intrusive paparazzi, and she is letting them know it.																								The slightly built star who played Tinkerbell in Hook was videotaped on Wednesday in Malibu wildly tailing two videographers, flagging them down and lecturing them for taping her near a school.																								 The footage, taken by freelance videographers for the celebrity news and photo agency Splash and broadcast by Inside Edition, shows Roberts driving in a Mercedes SUV behind the men, honking and waving them to stop.																								Im going to talk to you about the fact that youre at a school where children go. Turn it off, Roberts, 40, said in the footage, standing outside their car and pointing at the videographers after they pulled over.																								While driving, the Oscar-winning star of Erin Brockovich crossed over a double yellow line, and did not have children in her car, Splash media sales representative Amy Wiwuga said.																								Wiwuga would not reveal the videographers identities, citing the agencys policy on freelancers. Calls to Robertss publicist Marcy Engleman were not answered yesterday.

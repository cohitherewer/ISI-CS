Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 																								Calcutta, October 29: The CBI today asked two Karaya police sub-inspectors why they had spent all of four hours at Rizwanur Rahmans home after his father-in-law Ashok Todi lodged a verbal complaint of kidnapping.																								Pulak Dutta and Jayanta Chakraborty were interrogated with two other officers as the CBI today swivelled its probe to the police harassment of Rizwanur and Priyanka Todi.																								The agency also focused on the role of deputy commissioners Ajoy Kumar and Gyanwant Singh and assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty, recording the statement of Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur against them and hinting they would be summoned, too.																								During the seven-hour questioning of the four junior officers, the sleuths kept going across to the room where Rukbanur sat, cross-checking their statements with him.																								The SIs four-hour visit came on August 31. The couple promptly produced their marriage certificate and age-proof documents. Then what took them so long? a CBI official told The Telegraph.																								Dutta and Chakraborty reportedly replied they wanted Ashok Todi and his family members  who too visited the Tiljala Lane house that day  to talk to Priyanka in front of them as long as they wanted.																								They claimed they refused to intervene and left when Priyanka insisted she wanted to be with Rizwanur, the CBI official said.																								Since Dutta alone had been assigned to visit the Rahman home, Chakraborty was asked why he had gone along, too. He reportedly replied he had just accompanied his colleague.																								Swapan Mitra, officer in charge (OC) of Karaya police station, was asked why his men had meddled in a married couples personal lives. The CBI also told Mitra to explain what he had done to ensure the security of Rizwanur and Priyanka, who had written to him on September 3 saying they were living in fear.																								The OC said his officers had informed a police kiosk near Rizwanurs home to look after the couples security.																								Rukbanur told the CBI how his brother was forced to sign a bond at Lalbazar on September 8 and Priyanka was bullied into returning to the Todi home, ostensibly for seven days. Kumar, then city detective chief, threatened to arrest Rizwanur if he didnt sign the bond, said Rukbanur, who was present.																								Rukbanur said Priyanka had pleaded with Kumar that she would go only for three days but he scolded her and asked her to keep quiet, the CBI official said.																								On September 4, Gyanwant had also pressured Priyanka to return to her parents, Rukbanur said, going on to describe the alleged strong-arm tactics used by Sukanti.																								The agency is yet to summon the three senior officers, but team leader Arun Kumar said, We will speak to all those who we think need to be examined.																								Entally OC Pradip Dam, whom Rizwanur had informed through a letter about his marriage to Priyanka, was the fourth officer questioned. The couple were planning to shift to the CIT Road area, which falls in Dams territory.																								We wanted to match the officers statements against those provided by Rizwanurs family. There are some anomalies and we are checking them, a CBI official said.

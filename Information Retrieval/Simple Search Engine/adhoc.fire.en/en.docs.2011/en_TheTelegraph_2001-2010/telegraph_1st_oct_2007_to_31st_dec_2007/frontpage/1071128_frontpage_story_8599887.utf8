				 Avinash kin claim cash lure
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Bhubaneswar, Nov. 27: The laptop of Avinash Patnaik, the young businessman from Angul whose body was found from the residence of upcoming model Moon Das at Mumbai, recovered by his family after his death has raised several questions. 																								Pritam Patnaik, Avinashs elder brother, said that the latter had transferred Rs 5 lakh to Moons account though a cheque on February 14  Valentines Day. 																								The documents are on his laptop and we can prove it anytime. Also, he has spent lakhs to book an apartment in the name of the girl and his mother, said Suvendu Pattnaik, the boys paternal uncle. A communication from the builder requesting him for the payment of money was found on the laptop. There are also photographs of Moon and him on a beach together, said Avinashs father, Bhupen Patnaik. 																								Avinashs family members alleged that Moon incited Avinash to spend fortunes on her and, once it was over, dumped him. Avinash, who owned a rice mill, had a bank balance of around Rs 1.25 crore and had availed a bank loan of Rs 2 crore. 																								Its strange that the Mumbai police is behaving in a one-sided manner. How can they close the case without proper investigation? asked Bhupen. 																								Pritam, an MBA student in Mumbai, said he was aware of his brothers relationship. 																								How can the police officers say its an open-and-shut case without proper investigation? Why should Avinash shoot himself on the left temple so perfectly when he was a right hander? he asked. Also the gun was found on his thighs, he added. 																								Avinash also wanted to launch a music album, starring Moon. For this purpose, he had invested some money to get offers for Moon in music albums, claimed Pritam. 																								Avianshs friends at Angul said she had visited him on September 24 and 25, and the duo stayed at the Durga Hotel in Angul as a married couple. 																								Refuting Moons claim that Avinash was mentally unstable, his father Bhupen said that only four hours before the shooting, Avinash had spoken to his mother over phone. He had sounded normal and cheerful. There is no way he would have killed anyone a few hours later, Bhupen said. 																								Noted celebrity manager Suvendu in Bhubaneswar said that the duo were known to be married in the party circuit. We were surprised to learn four months ago that Moon married a guy from Angul, he said. 																								Avinash had allegedly shot Moon Dass mother and uncle before killing himself in the New Link Garden building in Andheris Yamuna Nagar on Thursday.

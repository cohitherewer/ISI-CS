				 Blame game on top cop for shielding son
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 4: Rajasthan police have accused the Orissa police top brass of preventing the arrest of former Orissa DGP B.B. Mohanty who allegedly helped his rape convict son jump parole.																								Mohanty is currently under suspension. He is charged with helping his son Bitihotra Mohanty, who was convicted for raping a German student in 2006 and sentenced to seven years in jail, jump parole. 																								Bitihotra was released on parole for 15 days on Nov 20, 2006, and has since evaded police. His father, who signed his surety bond of Rs 50,000, is accused of hindering a probe into his sons disappearance. 																								He has claimed that he is unaware of his sons whereabouts. Mohanty senior was granted interim bail till February 5 by the Orissa High Court. But a Rajasthan court has since issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against him. 																								A state police team, which went to Orissa to execute the warrant, claimed that the Orissa top police brass had not been co-operating in conducting search and effecting arrest of the accused. 																								The team searched his office where it was intimated that he was on leave and searched the city, but he remained untraceable, the state police said in their affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court. 																								Rajasthan police also sought a court direction to the DGP, Orissa, Cuttack , to execute the warrant, arrest Mohanty senior and hand him for further probe into his sons disappearance. The issue of evading arrest and not surrendering gains more gravity as the accused is the highest ranking police officer and his conduct is not befitting of the rank he is holding, the affidavit said.

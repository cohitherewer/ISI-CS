				 Ranjit on CBI list
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Nov. 13: Ranjit Pal, the Maoist Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee accused of running arms training camps in Nandigram, figures on the CBI list of most wanted.																								The 24-year-old from Bankura in Bengal joined the rebel ranks in the late 1990s. CBI is looking for him in connection with the killing of Jamshedpur MP Sunil Mahto in March. Maoists have denied involvement in Mahtos murder, but Jharkhand police say Pal had pumped bullets into Mahto. Pal is a senior member of the Bengal-Orissa-Jharkhand (BOJ) border area committee that oversees Maoist operations in parts of south Bengal (Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore), Orissa (Mayurbhanj) and Jharkhand (East Singhbhum), a senior Jharkhand police officer said.																								The East Singhbhum police suspect that Maoists from their district frequent East and West Midnapore.																								 During a recent raid on Patamda and Ghatshila, they stumbled on at least six local train tickets from Ghatshila to Mecheda in East Midnapore.																								A police officer admitted the possibility of these Maoist cadre frequenting Nandigram. There are buses to Nandigram from Mecheda.

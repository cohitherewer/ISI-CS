				 Dad theft charge on runaway girl 
 A STAFF REPORTER								 Rakesh Sahu (top) and Sweety. Pictures by Gopal Senapati 				 				 		Calcutta, Nov. 2: A girl who angered her rich father in Mumbai by marrying an assistant cashier in Howrah could be dragged back to the western metropolis tomorrow by a police team armed with an arrest warrant.																								Unlike Ashok Todi who targeted son-in-law Rizwanur Rahman, Hanuman Mal Tater has filed his theft complaint against daughter Sweety.																								The 20-year-old woman fainted when the Mumbai police team arrived at her home in Howrahs Dr Abani Dutta Road this afternoon. Husband Rakesh Sahu, 24, rushed back from the Theatre Road clinic where he works to take her to Golabari police station with the Mumbai team.																								She fainted there again and was admitted to the district hospital. Tomorrow, she is to be produced in court, which will decide if the Mumbai police can take her away.																								The couple fell in love six years ago when the families were neighbours in Howrah, Rakesh said. We married on March 20 this year after she had turned 20.																								Events then closely followed the Rizwanur saga. Tater, who kept pressuring Sweety to leave Rakesh, moved to Mumbai as director of a financial firm in April. He coaxed Sweety into going with him for a few days but would not allow her to return, Rakesh said.																								Rakesh travelled to Mumbai and met Sweety outside Taters home on August 21 but the father-in-law allegedly spotted him and got him detained at Gamdavi police station. Rakesh said the officers threatened to frame him if he did not divorce Sweety.																								A suicide threat by Sweety, who landed up at the police station, secured Rakeshs release and he returned to Howrah.																								On September 13, Sweety ran away and flew to Calcutta, and Rakesh took her to Golabari police station at 8pm the same day to set the record straight. But Tater had already lodged the theft complaint and Golabari police had been informed, so they were detained till 3am.																								Rakesh later informed the CID, submitted copies of their marriage certificate and got Sweetys statement recorded on October 29.																								She (Sweety) will be produced in court tomorrow, Howrah police chief Niraj Kumar Singh confirmed.

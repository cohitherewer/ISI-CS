				 CBI glare on cop accounts
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Oct. 30: The CBI today summoned four police officers transferred for meddling in Rizwanur Rahmans marriage and asked them about their recent bank transactions, agency officials said.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had spoken of a money power angle to the case, in which the police have been accused of colluding with Rizwanurs businessman father-in-law Ashok Todi to try and break up the marriage.																								The officers were asked why no action had been taken against Todi for lodging a false abduction complaint against Rizwanur.																								Deputy commissioners Gyanwant Singh and Ajoy Kumar, assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das may be questioned again because their answers didnt always match those they had given the CID, agency officials said.																								The two IPS officers (Gyanwant and Kumar) were questioned at a neutral place. We spoke to them on a few aspects of the case that I cant divulge, said CBI joint director Arun Kumar.																								A fifth policeman questioned was Chandan Sarkar, the assistant sub-inspector from Government Railway Police, Dum Dum, who had seen Rizwanurs body on the Patipukur tracks.																								He was asked if any railway ticket was found on the body and said no. Some residents of Patipukurs Shanti Colony have said they did find a train ticket in Rizwanurs trouser pocket.																								The DCs were asked what they had done to ensure that Rizwanurs wife Priyanka returned to him after seven days from Todis home in keeping with a bond they had forced Rizwanur to sign.																								They told us they did not know that Todi had left the city with his daughter, a CBI official said.																								At that, the interrogators referred to then police commissioner Prasun Mukherjees declaration at a news conference that Todi had left Calcutta but would be back in two days. If they did not know about Todis movements, how did the commissioner know about his date of return? the CBI official said.																								He added that the agency would probe these discrepancies in the later rounds of interrogation.																								The CBIs day started at 10.30am with the interrogation of Sukanti and Krishnendu at Nizam Palace in the presence of the agencys special director M.L. Sharma. Around 2.40pm, the two officers were taken to the BSF headquarters on Gurusaday Dutt Road, where the two DCs were called in.																								Gyanwant and Kumar were questioned in front of Sukanti and Krishnendu. After about 40 minutes, the ASI was sent back to Nizam Palace for another round of questions. The other three were quizzed together as well as separately till 7pm.

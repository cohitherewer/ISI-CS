				 Scan on track for murder
 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI																								Calcutta, Oct. 20: The CBI today started its investigation into Rizwanur Rahmans death with a visit to the spot where his body was found, and hinted that it wanted to make Priyanka a witness in the murder case against her father Ashok Todi.																								The agency is also considering exhumation of Rizwanurs body for a second post-mortem.																								We will consider this after a detailed investigation. We also want to make Priyanka one of the witnesses, an official said.																								The sleuths also visited the Rahmans Tiljala home and spent two-and-a-half hours there, learning the full sequence of events since August 31, the day Priyanka had moved in, till September 21 when Rizwanurs body was found.																								The bodys unusual position  face up, hands folded across the chest  earlier occupied the seven-member team at the Patipukur railway tracks in north Calcutta, with the officials reconstructing the scene in a hunt for clues (see chart). 																								Our officials reconstructed the events leading to his death. We are collecting all documents relating to the case, joint director Arun Kumar, the leader of the team, told The Telegraph.																								The agency is expected to question Todi and members of his family in the next few days.																								Asked why they had registered a murder case against the businessman, Kumar said: We have started the murder case on the basis of the petition filed by Rizwanurs mother after legally examining the Calcutta High Court order.																								Normally, the CBI would have treated as its starting point the earlier CID probe, but this could not be done because the high court had termed the state agencys investigation not in accordance with law.																								The petition (by Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan and brother Rukbanur) blamed Todi and we took that as the starting point for our investigations, a CBI official said.																								We have also seen media reports  there are many unanswered questions. Even the role of the police is very suspicious, another official said.																								The FIR, on its way to the Bankshall court by post, mentions three sections: 302 (murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120B (conspiracy). It mentions Todi and others, and officials said the officers accused of bullying Rizwanur may be included if evidence is found against them.																								The CBI sleuths, who included deputy inspector-general (special) Satish Golchha, had arrived at the Patipukur tracks armed with a map. With them were a doctor, a forensic expert and two Government Railway Police officers.																								The sleuths examined photographs of Rizwanurs body and questioned Chandan Sarkar, the GRP assistant sub-inspector who had seen the body, about the injury marks on it.																								Around 12.45pm, they reached the CID headquarters and met Niraj Narayan Pandey, inspector-general (special), who had conducted the state agencys probe that termed the death a suicide. 																								Kishwar Jahan said: We told them (the CBI) everything and they noted down the details. I told them about Todis threat of dire consequences to Rizwanur.																								The CBI collected photocopies of the marriage certificate, Priyankas birth certificate, the couples letters telling Lalbazar bosses they were legally married, and a photograph of the couple.																								We took Rizwanurs mobile number and Rukbanurs letter of complaint to Karaya police station, an official said.

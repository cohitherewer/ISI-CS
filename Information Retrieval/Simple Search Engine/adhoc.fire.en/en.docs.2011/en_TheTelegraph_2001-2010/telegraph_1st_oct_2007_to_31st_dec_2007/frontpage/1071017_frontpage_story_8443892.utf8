				 CMP to set right history
 SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA																								Ranchi, Oct. 16: If the Madhu Koda government has its way, over 3,000 acres, which the British had confiscated during colonial rule, would be restored to Tana Bhagats!																								Besides, the state would set up fast-track courts to restore lands to tribals and dispose of rebel-related cases.																								These plans have found a place in the much-awaited common minimum programme (CMP) of the UPA government, which is ready with chief minister Madhu Koda.																								A committee, headed by deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi, drafted the guiding principles to the running of the government comprising at least five political parties and six Independents. 																								The allies have been invariably browbeating Koda for not adopting the CMP for the last one year.																								The Tana Bhagats had lost their land after they had participated in Gandhis non-cooperation movement. 																								The followers of the Tana Bhagat movement, which became a religious rally of sorts, have been demanding back their land since Independence. The tribals have also been fighting for the land, which the non-tribals had got transferred illegally.																								In Ranchi alone, 1,200 such cases are pending in the special area regulation (SAR) court.																								Meanwhile, the CMP was silent on adopting zero tolerance policy to deal with the scourge of extremism. Rather, it considers it as a socio-economic problem and plans to create awareness among those who have deviated to retrieve them to the mainstream of society, besides stressing development of affected areas.																								Also, the withdrawal of extremist-related petty cases might help to curb the menace, it says. It wants to compensate people in common, who were victim to Naxalite violence.																								Among the other plans, the CMP will give preference to local youths in Grade IV jobs in the government and public sectors. It wants to set up a university  both central and technical  in every division, and AIIMS, IIMs and IIT with central aid. Under the CMP, 10 per cent of the dwelling units under Indira Awas Yojana will be reserved for members of minority communities living below poverty line. At the same time, it has said the state will frame schemes for progress of the poor among upper castes and review MoUs to remove obstacles to them through a single window system.																								Stephen Marandi, refusing to divulge the details, said the CMP has been submitted to the chief minister, who has to make it public now.

																								Islamabad, Dec. 28: Benazir Bhutto died when the force of the explosion yesterday crashed her head against a lever on the sunroof of her vehicle, the Pakistan government revealed today.
																								Interior (home) ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said she was not killed by either bullets or shrapnel from the blast, as suspected yesterday.
																								The bomber struck when Bhutto was leaving a rally and had stood up out of her bullet-proof vehicles sunroof to wave to supporters just outside the venue. 
																								Three shots were fired and the blast then went off as Bhutto was ducking back inside the car. The impact of her head on the sunroof lever fractured her skull and killed her, Cheema added.

																								There was no foreign element in her body. There is no ambiguity about the fact that there was no pellet wound or shrapnel wound in her body.
		Cheema argued that if a bullet or shrapnel were to hit her, it would have struck her on the left side. But she had suffered the fracture on the right. He said Bhuttos husband Asif Ali Zardari did not want a post-mortem to be conducted.
																								The government claimed to have evidence the attack was carried out by al Qaida and the Taliban.
																								Cheema said the government recorded an intelligence intercept this morning in which al Qaida leader Baitullah Mehsud congratulated his people for carrying out this cowardly act.
																								Police have released a photo of the suspected suicide bomber after reconstructing his face.
																								Investigators would reconstruct the head and take DNA samples from other body parts found nearby. The bombers badly burnt head was recovered from the scene of the blast.
																								In the alleged conversation between Mehsud and another militant, described as Maulvi Sahib by the government, two persons are named as having carried out the attack.
																								Cheema said Mehsud was also behind the October 18 bombing against Bhuttos homecoming parade through Karachi. Mehsud is a commander of the pro-Taliban forces in lawless South Waziristan, where al Qaida fighters are also active. 
																								Bhuttos assassination ignited widespread violence. At least 23 people were killed as furious Pakistanis ransacked banks, waged shootouts with police and burned train stations. 
																								Prime Minister Mohammedmian Soomro, however, said the government had no immediate plans to postpone the January 8 parliamentary elections.

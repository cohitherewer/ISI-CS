 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Raipur, Oct. 29: Rebels today killed five police personnel in the newly created Bijapur district, Chhattisgarh.																								All five were special police officers recruited by the villagers and trained by the government to counter Maoist attacks in Bastar. 																								The attack comes some two days after Indias top bureaucrats gave serious thought to the red menace in and around the Chhattisgarh capital. 																								The personnel, along with Chhattisgarh police jawans, had left for Pamalwaya, 5km from Bijapur and 550km from Raipur, today to provide security cover to workers engaged in a road construction project. 																								Around 11am, 250-300 armed rebels stormed the area and opened fire indiscriminately. Inspector-general of police (Bastar range) R.K. Vij who was present at the spot said five SPOs died on the spot, while three others, including a constable of the state police, were injured in the attack. Soon, the rebels fled and slipped into the nearby forests. 																								The fact that the rebels at-tacked an area where there was heavy security, has made the attack a serious matter, said a senior police officer. 																								The police believe that the attack was well-planned, as the rebels opened fire from all corners, not allowing the security personnel to retaliate. 																								Vij added that CRPF jawans and Chhattisgarh police were rushed to the spot for reinforcement.

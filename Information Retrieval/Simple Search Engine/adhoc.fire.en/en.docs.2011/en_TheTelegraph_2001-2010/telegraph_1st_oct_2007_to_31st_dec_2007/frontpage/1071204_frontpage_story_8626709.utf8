				 Sex-test shock from the past
 G.S. MUDURNew Delhi, Dec. 3: A name almost identical to that of a Delhi gynaecologist The Telegraph had blown the whistle on 14 years ago has popped up in a BBC sting operation on sex determination for British couples of Indian origin.																								The BBC programme telecast today shows a couple working undercover visiting a person the report identified as Dr Mangala Telang, a leading gynaecologist in Delhi, and seeking her services for determining the sex of their foetus.																								In 1993, The Telegraph had done a sting operation on a Dr Mangla Telang who offered to carry out sperm sorting for the reporters husband, who posed as a client, for a mere Rs 3,000. The sting was part of a series on sex pre-selection prevalent in Delhi through sperm-sorting, followed by sex-determination tests.																								What we learnt 14 years ago and what we saw today suggests that the same doctor can get away with wrongdoing again and again, said Puneet Bedi, a New Delhi-based gynaecologist who has been campaigning against sex determination.																								We can only imagine how many foetuses might have been aborted during this period, Bedi said. 																								Sex determination of any kind is illegal in India.																								The BBC report said Telang, who specialises in IVF treatment and has practised in some of Delhis top hospitals, has campaigned against female foeticide, calling it an evil crime. 																								Telang, also the president of the Indian Fertility Society, told The Telegraph today that she would not like to comment on the BBC report. 																								The secret filming by the BBC shows the person named Telang agreeing to perform a scan for the undercover couple within minutes. She warned the couple not to tell anyone about what they were doing as it was illegal. 																								The couple also asked whether she could recommend someone to carry out a termination if the unborn child was a girl and they decided to abort. According to a BBC statement, the doctor said: Yes, I can recommend someone. 																								Told by the BBC of the evidence, Telang said she was not in the room when the scan was carried out. But she was seen in the room, congratulating the couple, the BBC statement said. 																								The BBC report provides evidence suggesting that people of Indian origin in the UK are visiting India for sex tests and female foetus abortions.

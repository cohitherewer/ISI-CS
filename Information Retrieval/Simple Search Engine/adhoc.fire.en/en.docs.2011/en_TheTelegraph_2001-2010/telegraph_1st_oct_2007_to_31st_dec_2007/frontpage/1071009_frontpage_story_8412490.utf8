				 Entry bar shift prompts cop job recast 
 SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA 																								Ranchi, Oct. 8: The Jharkhand government is likely to quash the ongoing process for the recruitment of some 8,000 constables. 																								The in-principle decision came at a high-level meeting convened by chief minister Madhu Koda today with a view to discuss the ramifications of the Supreme Court order issued a week back. 																								The move will leave in a fix some six lakh unemployed persons who had applied for the job. 																								The apex court had set aside the Jharkhand High Court order issued on November 10, 2004, restraining the state government from appointing seventh graders as constables. Instead, the high court had asked the government to fix matriculation as the minimum qualification for a constable. 																								The state government issued the advertisement, setting matriculation as the minimum qualifications early this year. 																								Significantly, the appointment procedure, underway in several districts, had been stayed earlier after JMM chief Shibu Soren requested chief minister Madhu Koda to amend the rules to fix seventh pass as the minimum qualification to get entry into the constabulary. 																								The state government was in a dilemma over Sorens demand. The SC order has resolved our dilemma, said a government source. 																								Home secretary Sudhir Tripathy, who, along with director-general of police Vishnu Dayal Ram, attended the meeting, told The Telegraph that the selection list for the 2004 recruitment test will be redrawn in the light of the apex court order. 																								It is quite possible that a few persons might lose their jobs if they are declared surplus after adjusting the successful seventh graders, he said.																								The home secretary said the government has two options after the SC order. 																								Either publish a corrigendum to the minimum qualification criteria mentioned in the 2007 advertisement or quash the appointment process altogether, he said.																								The government was clueless about the exact number of successful seventh graders. We are seeking details from various districts to work out the formula, he said.																								Tripathy would not elaborate further, but sources said the fresh vacancy list would be quashed to adjust the seventh graders, who otherwise had qualified the test in 2004. 																								Around 10,000 persons were appointed in 2004. The apex court had set aside the HC order on the ground that the issue should not have been decided through a PIL. 																								The SC order, significantly, runs in the face of recommendations of the consecutive police commission reports making the minimum qualification at matriculate. Most of the states, including Bihar, have amended their rules accordingly.

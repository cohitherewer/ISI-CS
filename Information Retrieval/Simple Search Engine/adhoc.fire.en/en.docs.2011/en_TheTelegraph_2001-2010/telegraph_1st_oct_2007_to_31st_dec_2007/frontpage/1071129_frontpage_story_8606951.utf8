				 Gag on guest Taslima
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: Taslima Nasreen can stay on as Indias guest but will have to mind her tongue.																								The Centre today said it would continue to protect the Bangladeshi author as India had never refused anyone shelter.																								This civilisational heritage, which is now government policy, will continue, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee told Parliament in a statement, but added a word of advice to the controversial writer. She would have to refrain from activities and expressions that might harm Indias relations with friendly countries and hurt the sentiments of our people.																								He added that as along as guests like Taslima were in India, the Centre and state governments would provide them protection.																								Although expansive on Indias civilisational legacy, the statement didnt mention why Taslima had to flee CPM-ruled Bengal and was silent on the way the author was tossed from state to state, ostensibly for security reasons.																								It was clear the government didnt want to risk embarrassing its ally as Taslimas flight from Calcutta after last Wednesdays violence by minority protesters had provoked a debate on artistic freedom.																								The BJP called Mukherjees statement meaningless and incomplete.																								The statement is silent on why she was forced out of Bengal. Is she free to return to Calcutta? There is also no mention of whether she would be provided security, party leader V.K. Malhotra said.																								Malhotra also wanted to know why the government hadnt categorically said if Taslima would be allowed to stay anywhere she liked in India and if her visa would be extended once it expired.

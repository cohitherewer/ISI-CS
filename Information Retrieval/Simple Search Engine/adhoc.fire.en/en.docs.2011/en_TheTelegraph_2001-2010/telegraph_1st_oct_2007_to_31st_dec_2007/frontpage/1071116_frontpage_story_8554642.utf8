				 Cyclonic rain to usher in winter
 PINAKI MAJUMDAR 																								Jamshedpur, Nov. 15: Various parts of Jharkhand are expected to receive heavy rainfall in the next two days as a result of the cyclone, christened SIDR, hovering over the Bay of Bengal. 																								Officials at the Alipore Met Office in Calcutta said that though the cyclone is unlikely to wreak any devastation on Jharkhand as it passes the Bengal-Bangladesh belt, it could trigger rainfall in almost all of Jharkhand. Jharkhand will not be affected much by the strong intensity cyclone, but it would help in bringing rain to most parts of the state in the next 36 hours, said G.C. Debnath, the director of Alipore Met Office. 																								According to Debnath, the impact of the cyclone will be felt much more in areas of Gangetic West Bengal, northern parts of Orissa and Bangladesh. The cyclone is moving at a speed of over 80 nautical miles per hour with wind speed of around 200 km per hour.																								People living in the vulnerable areas of coastal Orissa have been evacuated as the cyclone is expected to unleash tidal waves five to six metres above normal. 																								Several parts of Jharkhand, especially those located in the hilly terrain, today experienced inclement weather with rainfall in traces. In the steel city, the minimum temperature shot up by almost three degrees Celsius (as compared to yesterdays temperature) due to the presence of dense clouds. The maximum temperature also went up by two degrees. 																								Weathermen said the formation of clouds was owing to the prevailing cyclonic condition. But they said that once the cyclone blows over, the mercury could witness an instant drop. The cyclonic condition is obstructing the winter from setting in. The weather chart analysis indicates that several districts of Jharkhand located in the Kolhan and Santhal Pargana regions would experience rainfall of moderate intensity in the next 48 hours. The present wind pattern is favouring the formation of clouds, said T.N. Jha, the director of Patna meteorological office, which monitors weather in Jharkhand and Bihar. Jha said the minimum temperature in places such as Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Hazaribagh, Chaibasa, Daltongunj and Koderma is expected to dip below 12-degree Celsius after November 18. 																								Statistics available from the Patna Meteorological Office suggests that during the last four days, the minimum temperature in various districts, including East Singhbhum, Seraikela-Kharswan, Hazaribagh, Palamau and Simdega, came down by about four degrees Celsius. But due to the cyclone, the temperature again went up by about two degrees. 																								In Jamshedpur, the minimum temperature gradually started coming down from November 11. From 18.2 degrees Celsius recorded on November 11, the mercury dipped to 14.5 degrees on November 14. Today, due to the cloudy condition the minimum temperature went up to 17.1 degrees Celsius.

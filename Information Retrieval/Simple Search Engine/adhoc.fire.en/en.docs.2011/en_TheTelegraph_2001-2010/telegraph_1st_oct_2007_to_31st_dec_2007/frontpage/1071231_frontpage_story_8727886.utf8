																								Nairobi, Dec. 30 (Reuters): Kenyas President Mwai Kibaki won a second five-year term today in a disputed election victory that triggered deadly riots by tens of thousands of opposition supporters.
																								Pushing the stakes still higher, his opposition rival Raila Odinga rejected the results as rigged and announced an alternative inauguration for Monday in a Nairobi park.
																								Local TV said 10 people were killed in Kisii, an ethnically mixed town in Nyanza, Odingas ethnic Luo homeland.
																								To curb spreading chaos in a nation usually known as a haven of stability in volatile east Africa, the government sent trucks of police onto the streets and banned live TV transmissions.
																								As smoke billowed from protests in Nairobi slums, Kibaki was sworn in on the lawn of State House just an hour after the final vote tally was announced, his hand on a Bible.
																								The 76-year-old urged Kenyans to put aside election passions and promised a corruption-free government to forge unity in the ethnically polarised nation of 36 million, the regions biggest economy.
																								I thank all of you for the trust you have bestowed upon me, he said. I urge all or us to set aside the passions that were excited by the election process and work together.
																								At Opposition headquarters, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) invited supporters to the alternative inauguration ceremony for the peoples president Odinga.
																								 There is a clique of people around Kibaki trying to rob Kenyans of the election, he said, wiping away tears. The train of democracy in Kenya is unstoppable like the flow of the Nile.
																								As he spoke, the government suspended all live TV broadcasts  and transmission of his news conference was cut. People who want to commit a crime do so in darkness, Odinga said.
																								Word of Kibakis victory sent some of his supporters onto the streets in celebration. But they were fast outnumbered by furious Opposition supporters.
																								Police shot into a crowd in Kisumu, killing three people, residents and witnesses said. A Reuters reporter was attacked in Kisumu. Some Nairobi shanty-town dwellers called wealthier friends begging for refuge in their homes.
																								Opposition allegations of rigging had already fuelled two days of ethnic riots. Kibakis camp said ODM also rigged votes.
																								In Kibera, Nairobis biggest shantytown, witnesses said protesters burned shacks as they chanted pro-Odinga slogans. Theres a lot of heat over here. People are out in their thousands, Kibera resident Joshua Odutu said against a backdrop of gunshots, whistles and shouting.
																								Kenyas electoral commission head, Samuel Kivuitu, declared Kibaki winner amid chaotic scenes. He was then escorted to safety by police.
																								Chief European Union observer Alexander Graf Lambsdorff said doubt remained over the accuracy of the count.

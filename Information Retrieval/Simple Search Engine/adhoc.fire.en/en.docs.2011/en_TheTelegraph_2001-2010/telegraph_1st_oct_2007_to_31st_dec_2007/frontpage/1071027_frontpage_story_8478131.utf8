				 Power boost to surplus state
 							 - 110 hydel units await nod OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Enough for everybody																								Bhubaneswar, Oct. 26: Orissa, already a power surplus state, would generate an additional 1,000MW hydro-electricity in near future if the proposals submitted by various private companies to set up 110 small and mini hydelpower units are cleared.																								State energy minister Surya Narayan Patro said 28 private developers had earlier been chosen to set up small and mini hydelpower projects in the state. 																								Recently, the state had invited expression of interest from private parties to establish small and mini hydelpower units following the decision of the Union government to encourage setting up of more such units to generate power. 																								The small and mini environment-friendly hydel power units will get an incentive of 14 paise per unit from an international agency for not emitting carbon, said the state energy minister. 																								Several private firms have shown interest in setting up such units in the state not only at the 34 sites identified by the state government, but also another 48 locations identified by themselves, said the state energy minister. 																								Patro said he had directed the state technical advisory committee, headed by the engineer in chief (electrical), today to examine the proposals and submit its report soon. 																								The committee would meet every fortnight and dispose of the proposals, he said. 																								If all these proposals are cleared, 110 small and mini hydel units will come up in the state with a total generation capacity of 1,000MW. 																								Not only will these units generate cheaper power, but there will also be no pollution, said the minister. 																								Once the proposals are cleared, the private par- ties will apply to the co- mmercial banks or the All India Renewable Energy Development Agency for loan assistance, said the state energy minister . 																								More than 1,800MW of power is available in the state as against the average demand of 1,600 to 1700MW. 																								While the state generates around 600MW of this total electricity generated from hydro power stations, it gets around 700MW from thermal plants. 																								The rest is part of the states share from the eastern grid and the Centreowned power plants located in the state. 																								The state government has already signed MoUs with 13 companies, including Tata Power, Visa Power, Calcutta Electricity Supply Corporation, Essar Power, Jindal Photo, Bhusan Energy and Sterlite Energy, last September for establishment of thermal power plants with an investment of about Rs 59,000 crore to generate about 11,000MW. 																								Recently, the state government has cleared expansion of three thermal power projects with an additional capacity of 2,000MW.

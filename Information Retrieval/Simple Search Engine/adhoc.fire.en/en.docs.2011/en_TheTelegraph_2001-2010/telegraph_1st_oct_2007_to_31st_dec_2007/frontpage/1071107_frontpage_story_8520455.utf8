				 Fan number leak lands Shilpa in a phone jam
																								Mumbai, Nov. 6 (AP): Actress Shilpa Shetty was swamped with hundreds of calls after a fan got hold of her mobile number and sent it out in a mass email, forcing her to file a police complaint.																								We have no clue how this person got hold of it... Shilpa is being harrowed with hundreds of calls and SMSs from all kinds of people, her publicist Dale Bhagwagar, who filed the complaint, said today.																								Now in Britain performing a musical titled Miss Bollywood, Shilpa was extremely perturbed her number was known to hundreds of people, he said. She has stopped using the number.																								Some want to date her, some want to just listen to her voice, some want to enquire if Miss Bollywood is doing fine and some call just to check if they are speaking to the real Shilpa Shetty, he said.																								We have given the complaint in writing and will register an FIR as and when police tell us to. The person who is spreading the number identifies himself as Jeetu Sethi. The fans who are calling on the number are innocent, we want action against the person spreading the number.																								Shilpa became an international star after her appearance on the British reality show, Celebrity Big Brother.																								A Mumbai police officer, Sushil Joshi, said investigations were under way. The fan could face six months in jail for harassment and illegally using the Internet to publicise a private phone number.

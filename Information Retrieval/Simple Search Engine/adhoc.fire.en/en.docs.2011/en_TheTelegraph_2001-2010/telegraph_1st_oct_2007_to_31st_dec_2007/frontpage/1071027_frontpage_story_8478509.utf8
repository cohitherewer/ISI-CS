				 SC conditions for Vedanta
																								New Delhi, Oct. 26 (Reuters): The Supreme Court has set new conditions on Britains Vedanta Resources and its Indian unit on Friday before allowing it to mine bauxite in the sacred, forested hills in Orissa.																								Vedanta wants to dig open-cast mines in the Niyamgiri hills to feed an alumina refinery it has already built in the area as part of an $800 million project expected initially to produce 1 million tonnes of alumina per year.																								At an earlier hearing, Vedanta had promised to invest Rs 1.12 billion ($28.4 million) to develop the poor region, but a three-judge bench said it wanted this commitment to be made by the firms Indian unit, Sterlite Industries.																								What is Vedanta? the bench said. Vedanta is not listed in India. So let Sterlite give an undertaking.																								Thousands of tribal people say the mine will destroy hills they consider sacred, force them from their homes and destroy their livelihoods, which are based on farming millet, hunting and collecting fruits and spices from the forests.																								Environmentalists say the open-cast mine would also wreck the rich biodiversity of the remote hills and disrupt key water sources that supply springs and streams in the area and feed two rivers that irrigate large areas of farmland.																								The court asked Sterlite to pay five per cent of its annual profits from mining throughout India to the state government to be ploughed into developing the region.																								It also asked the company to deposit Rs 500 million with the state government, and specify how many local pe-ople would be employed in the project.																								The court has asked Sterlite to file an affidavit to this effect, and is expected to give a final order within a month, lawyers said.																								The indications seem more towards it getting clearance, said Ritwick Dutta, part of the legal team opposing the mine.																								I am really disappointed, said Bratindi Jena of ActionAid.																								The court didnt listen to what we were saying, she said, adding that Fridays discussion had been all about money. These things are really meaningless to us.																								Jena said that the survival of the Dongria Kondh tribe was at stake. At a community level, people are so against it.																								The state and central government both back the plan, as part of efforts to industrialise and exploit the mineral resources of underdeveloped eastern India.																								The environment ministry told the court this month that the mining would only affect a marginal amount of forestland.

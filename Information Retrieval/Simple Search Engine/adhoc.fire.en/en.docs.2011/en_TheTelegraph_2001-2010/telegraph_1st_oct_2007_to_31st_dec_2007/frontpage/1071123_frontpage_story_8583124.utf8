				 Fed up, CRPF boss leaves
 															- State polices partisan role frustrates central force KINSUK BASU				 	 Raj																								Nandigram, Nov. 22: The latest to flee Nandigram is the man the CRPF sent to restore normality.																								Deputy inspector-general Alok Raj left Nandigram this morning, apparently disgusted with state polices partisan role. Local officers have been freeing people nabbed by the CRPF while allegedly trying to keep the central force out of the trouble spots.																								Raj, the CRPFs senior-most officer in Nandigram, drove out around 11.30am, saying he was going to a meeting in Tamluk. But he headed for Calcutta.																								CRPF inspector-general Subhas Goswami, based in Calcutta, later said Raj had gone on leave for two days and commandant R.K. Sharma would be in charge. Rajs colleagues said that till yesterday, he had given no hint he was going on leave.																								The officers frustration boiled over when the police released Anup Mondal, 40, hours after the CRPF picked him up yesterday. Anup is not only accused of terrorising returning refugees, he has at least six criminal cases against him, including two murder attempts.																								Raj refused to go into all this but said certain things have not gone the way it was planned.																								CRPF sources said the force had informed its top brass about the polices partisan role. It today sent a report to the Centre explaining why it was proving impossible to instil confidence among the villagers. A copy was forwarded to state police chief A.B. Vohra.																								We wanted to set up a camp at Takapura but the police shot down the proposal. Now the police have set up a camp near Takapura. Why werent we allowed to go there? a senior CRPF officer asked. Takapura is the gateway to several villages where intimidation may be going on.																								We havent yet been handed a list of the wanted criminals. Intelligence-sharing is nil, the officer said.

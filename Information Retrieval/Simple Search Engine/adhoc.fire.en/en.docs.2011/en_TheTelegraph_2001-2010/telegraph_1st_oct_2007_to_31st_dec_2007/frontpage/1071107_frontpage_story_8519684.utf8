				 HC prod on power
 OUR BUREAU																								Ranchi, Nov. 6: The high court today directed the Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) to ensure that people were informed in advance when there would be load-shedding in their areas. 																								A two-judge bench hearing a PIL on the frequent load-shedding in the state said the people had come to believe that while they were deprived of power, judges, ministers and influential persons had enough of it. 																								A contingency plan needs to be drawn to remove the problem at its root so that all get electricity, the bench of Chief Justice M. Karpagavinayagam and Justice D.K. Sinha said. 																								The board, the bench said, ought to publish a timetable of load-shedding so that the people prepare themselves and are not taken by surprise. 																								The court also directed the board to file a status report in the matter. 																								The board said it would draw more power from Damodar Valley Corporation to meet its requirements. Talks are on for a proposal to take power from DVC to augment the depleted supply in the capital and in the state. 																								The JSEB said that till October 24, it drew about 270 MW of power from the central pool, but at present it has gone down drastically. With less power being received from the central pool, the supply has gone down to as low as 120 MW, which is way too short of the actual power.																								The counsel for the board also said of the two units in Tenughat of 210 MW each, one is not in working condition and the thermal power plant is running under capacity. 																								JSEB chairman V.N. Pandey told The Telegraph that the proposed MoU to be signed with DVC for additional power allocations for the state is likely to be signed tomorrow at Calcutta.																								The MoU was to be signed today but was deferred for technical reasons. 																								We are pressing for an additional allocation of at least 150 MW from the central pool. In case of difficulties, we would settle for 100 MW. However, we are making efforts for maximum allocation so that we can tide over the crisis, Pandey said.

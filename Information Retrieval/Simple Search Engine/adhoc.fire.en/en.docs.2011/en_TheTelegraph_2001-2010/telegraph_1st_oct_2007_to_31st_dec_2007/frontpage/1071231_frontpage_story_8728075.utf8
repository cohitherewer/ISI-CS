																								New York, Dec. 30: Benazir Bhutto was so fearful for her life that she tried to hire British and American security experts to protect her.
																								But the plans collapsed because President Pervez Musharraf refused to allow the foreign contractors to operate in Pakistan, according to her senior aides.
																								She asked to bring in trained security personnel from abroad, said Mark Siegel, Bhuttos US representative. In fact, she and her husband repeatedly tried to get visas for such protection, but they were denied by the government of Pakistan.
																								Bhuttos entourage discussed deals with the American Blackwater operation. Sources within the British private security industry said she also had negotiations with the London-based firm Armor Group, which guards UK diplomats in West Asia. Last night, the company said that it had no knowledge of any talks.
																								But a Blackwater spokesman confirmed the negotiations. We were approached to provide (former) Prime Minister Bhuttos security, but an agreement was unfortunately never reached, she said. She declined to go into the precise details.
																								Bhutto contacted officials, diplomats and friends in America, Europe and the Gulf to urge Musharraf to improve her security following the suicide bomb attacks that killed more than 140 during her homecoming parade on October 19.
																								Indeed, US diplomats took the highly unusual step of providing her directly with confidential US intelligence about militant threats to her life.
																								Pakistans interior ministry also passed on details of plots against her and aides said that letters containing death threats had been smuggled into her home.
																								Husain Haqqani, a US-based Bhutto adviser, confirmed that she wanted to use private international security contractors but said the Musharraf regime would not approve the plan.
																								He added that America, which has arranged for private contractors to guard Afghan president Hamid Karzai and leaders in Iraq, was reluctant to press Musharraf to change his mind. 
																								This was despite Washington seeing Bhutto as a lynchpin in its crucial diplomatic attempt to encourage Pakistan to return to democracy.
																								Siegels comments will add to the long-running controversy over Bhuttos security arrangements, which were widely regarded as woefully inadequate, given the threats against her.
																								She relied largely on using a human shield of loyal followers who would form a ring around her, but it was little real protection against a determined assailant.
																								Some security industry specialists have suggested, however, that there may have been other reasons why the help of foreign security firms was not enlisted. Being surrounded by foreign bodyguards would have added to criticism that Bhutto was in the pocket of the West  an accusation levelled at President Karzai  and might not have been welcomed by her own Pakistani security staff.
																								But the companies could have taken a back role as consultants and trained locals in bodyguard techniques.
																								Its odd and disturbing that the Pakistan government did not do a better job of protecting her and that the US apparently could not do more to persuade them, said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer.

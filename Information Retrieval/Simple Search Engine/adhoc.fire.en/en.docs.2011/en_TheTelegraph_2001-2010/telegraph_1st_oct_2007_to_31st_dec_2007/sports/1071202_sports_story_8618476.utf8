 Sasi draws with Macieja
Khanty Mansiysk (Russia): Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran played out an easy draw with polish GM Bartlomiej Macieja in the first game of the third round of the Chess World Cup here. After a lot of hard work in the first two matches that were stretched to the tiebreak stage, Sasikiran will look forward to an improved performance in the return game in the last 32 stage against Macieja, who has performed way above expectations here. The tournament started with 128 players including five Indians and Sasikiran emerged as the lone Indian survivor after the first round. The biggest upset since the ouster of Azerbaijani Teimour Radjabov came in the third round when Ivan Cheparinov of Bulgaria, more famous as second of compatriot former world champion Veselin Topalov, outplayed Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan. The first day of the third round produced just three more decisive games. Besides Cheparinov, the other winners were Gata Kamsky, Dmitry Jakovenko and Wang Yue of China. Sasikiran, had little troubles with his black pieces as he used an idea introduced by fellow Indian P. Harikrishna a few years back in the Slav defence.  (PTI)

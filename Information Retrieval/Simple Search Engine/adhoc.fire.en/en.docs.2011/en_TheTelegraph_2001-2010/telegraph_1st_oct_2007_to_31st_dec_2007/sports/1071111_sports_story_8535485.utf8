 Australians in cruise control
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Australias new era continued to look much like their old one as they dominated mercilessly at the Gabba for a third day, forcing Sri Lanka to follow-on a massive 340 runs behind. The visitors then lost both openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Maravan Atapattu to complete a miserable day, according to www.cricinfo.com. Ricky Ponting has been prone to batting again to give his bowlers a rest, so his decision to make Sri Lanka follow on may have raised a few eyebrows, but it was not entirely unexpected. Sri Lanka, with the odd exception, havent batted well all tour and they were well behind when their first innings closed. It was an innings notable for Mitchell Johnsons first Test wicket and Brett Lees four for 26, while Stuart MacGill nudged closer to 200 Test victims after eventually breaking through in the final session following some excellent, but unrewarded, toil Stuart Clark opened the day by finding the captain Mahela Jayawardenes edge in the third over, but the biggest cheers were reserved for Johnsons first Test wicket, that of Thilan Samaraweera. Atapattu then took root and played out a battling 51, compiled over 183 deliveries.

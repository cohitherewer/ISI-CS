 Symonds makes the difference
INDRANIL MAJUMDAR Sourav Ganguly after his dismissal for 86 on Sunday. (AFP) Nagpur: For most of the day, it looked as if the sixth ODI wont be one of those that go down the wire. And after a brief while when it looked as if India may upset all calculations, the match ended predictably. Eighteen runs separated the teams and it could have gone the Indians way had they shown a bit more positive approach. Australia go in to the final one-dayer in Mumbai having pocketed the Future Cup with a 4-1 lead. It needed a miracle for India to stay alive in the series after Man of the Match Andrew Symonds vented his ire on the hapless hosts. The 318-run target, however, looked within grasp as Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar stitched 140 runs in another epic opening stand. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Robin Uthappa rattled of 72 in 46 balls for the sixth wicket to raise fresh hopes, but the pairs dismissal in quick succession meant curtains. When Brett Lee had dropped Uthappa an over earlier, it was thought to be the defining moment. But the world champions proved they are made of sterner stuff. Uthappas 28-ball 44 ended with a superb tumbling catch from Hopes and Dhonis assault was also shortlived. Questions will continue to be raised about the logic behind sending Rahul Dravid at No.4. The team needed quick runs and sending the former captain, who has struggled through the series, was shocking. Even Ricky Ponting found it surprising. When Irfan Pathan was dismissed, India needed 129 off 102 balls. The Australians pounced on the opportunity as Dravid found the going tough. The momentum was lost as Australia made quick inroads. Three wickets fell within 15 runs and the balance tilted in favour of Australia. Dhoni could have sent Dravid at No.3. He would have got more balls to settle down. The former captain could have been placed further down the order too. A Dhoni or Uthappa blitzkrieg at No. 4 could have changed the complexion of the match. The way Sourav and Sachin timed their innings highlighted their importance to the side. It should put the Doubting Thomases to rest. Their 26th century stand was exhilarating. They not only captivated the full house with their skill and timing, what shone through was their assurance at the crease. Ponting was clueless during their 151-ball association until Sachin fell to a smart piece of work by Adam Gilchrist. The run-a-ball 72 had nine fours and a six. Souravs 86 (111 balls, 7x4, 2x6) was a typical demonstration of his indomitable will. Nothing shook his resolve or disturbed his concentration. The way he charged down to heave Nathan Bracken for a six showed he is not finished yet. Sachins exit, however, slowed down Sourav. Pathan tried to inject some momentum but lost his application after getting involved in a war of words with Symonds. Later Symonds tried to play it down. I cant remember anything I was trying to find out how many balls were left in that over, he said. Ponting tried to cool things after a light-hearted chat with Pathan. Brad Hogg (4/49) did the most of the damage. Symonds has transformed from a brash slogger to a champion batsman with an uncanny ability to bat efficiently in all conditions. Having got involved in an intense off-the-field controversy in the build up to this game, Symonds showed that nothing had disturbed his concentration and focus. The relief was evident as he reached his sixth and maiden century against India. An emotional fist pumping towards the dressing room was followed by a leap of joy. The absence of Matthew Hayden (hip injury) and the early departure of Michael Clarke made no difference as Adam Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting added 96 in 85 balls for the second wicket. The Australian captain set the tone with a crushing four and six off Zaheer Khan. Gilchrist was lucky to survive on 16 when Dravid spilled a chance at gully. Harbhajan Singh was introduced in the 13th over and the visitors found the going tough. Ponting was deceived by a straighter and Gilchrist followed playing straight into the hands of cover. A little later Murali Kartik got into the act. The Aussies were looking down the barrel at 204 for five but Symonds held fort. With Brad Haddin and James Hopes providing invaluable support, Symonds carried the innings on his shoulders.

 Federer back on track, Roddick in semi-finals
 - MASTERS CUP 
 - Davydenko eliminated from showcase tournament  Andy Roddick and Roger Federer after their wins over Fernando Gonzalez and Nikolay Davydenko, respectively, in the Masters Cup in Shanghai on Wednesday. (AFP) Shanghai: World No. 1 Roger Federer got his quest for a fourth Tennis Masters Cup title back on track with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Russian Nikolay Davydenko in the Red Group on Wednesday. Following Federer on court, American Andy Roddick became the first player to book a semi-final spot at the season-ending event in Shanghai after crushing Chiles Fernando Gonzalez 6-1, 6-4. Federer, stunned by Gonzalez in his round robin opener on Monday, was again below his best but he was still good enough to eliminate Davydenko from the showcase eight-man tournament. It was a different situation coming back from losing, shrugged the Swiss, who had never lost a round robin match at the Masters Cup before being ambushed by Gonzalez. Here you lose and you play another top 10 guy. This was a top-four guy so it doesnt get any easier. Anything can happen in the mens game. Youre a little bit off, youre a little bit tired, youll lose right away. But I created (for) myself many, many opportunities so eventually Ill break through and Ill break their will. Federer, who has a 14-1 record against Roddick, must now beat the American on Friday to avoid an early exit from the $4.45 million event. With cow bells echoing around the Qi Zhong Stadium, Federer struggled to overcome an opponent he had beaten in all their previous 10 meetings. Federer, who is bidding to win a fourth title in the last five years at the tournament, did just enough to take a scrappy first set despite 22 unforced errors. He broke to lead 5-3, promptly dropped his own serve but restored normal service in the next game, breaking again to win the set when Davydenko blew an easy smash. Federer raised his game in the second, a forehand rocket giving him a 3-1 lead, and he quickly put Davydenko out of his misery to kick-start his title challenge. Davydenko, who will be involved in the Davis Cup final starting later this month, already has his getaway planned once his final Masters Cup match is over with. I fly to the Maldives on Sunday for one week for a rest, said Davydenko, who won his appeal against a $2,000 fine for not trying hard enough during a match. The end of the season I was really tired physically and mentally. Gonzalez suffered a letdown after his upset over Federer, Roddick steam-rolling the Chilean in just 65 minutes to reach the semi-finals for the third time in four appearances. In the doubles event, No. 5 Lukas Dlouhy and Pavel Vizner of the Czech Republic beat No. 6 Arnaud Clement and Michael Llorda of France 3-6, 6-3, 10-5 (tie-break). (Reuters)

 Benitez wants calm approach
 Rafael Benitez with Steven Gerrard in Liverpool on Tuesday, the eve of their Champions League clash with Porto. (AFP) Liverpool: Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has warned his side not to be over-adventurous against Porto on Wednesday despite being in a precarious qualifying position in the Champions League. Liverpool are third in Group A with four points, three behind Marseille and a further point behind leaders Porto. In the nights other match the French side play Besiktas. We must not lose, he told reporters on Tuesday. People are not considering this but if we draw and beat Marseille in our final game, and Marseille lose to Besiktas we can also qualify. We are still in a very good position. We were outstanding in our last game when we beat Newcastle and are playing really well. You can see that the players are playing well, passing the ball and playing pretty football. Benitez says the furore over his future has not affected his preparations for the game. Reports have claimed he could face the sack after falling out with the clubs American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett over transfer funds. There has been no distraction for me, he said. Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina has given Benitez his full backing and claims the players are fully focussed on the match rather than their managers fate. It isnt affecting us at all. Its always not easy or nice but all we can do is play football and show how good or bad we are on the pitch, he told reporters. Its not a question of keeping the manager in a job, its about winning the game to keep playing in the Champions League as long as possible. We want to keep getting points so we can focus on playing Marseille and make it like a final.  (REUTERS)

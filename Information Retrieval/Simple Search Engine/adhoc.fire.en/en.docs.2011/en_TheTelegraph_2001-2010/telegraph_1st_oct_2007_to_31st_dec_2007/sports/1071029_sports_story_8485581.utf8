 Siddons named Bangla coach
Dhaka: Australian Jamie Siddons has accepted an offer to coach Bangladesh. Siddons, 43, would arrive in Dhaka on Monday to discuss and finalise his contract, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said in a statement on Sunday. I am thrilled to announce that I have accepted an offer from the BCB to coach the Bangladesh national team, the statement quoted Siddons as saying. Bangladesh last week expressed shock and surprise when former Australian batsman John Dyson, one of three men shortlisted for their coaching job along with Siddons and Zimbabwean Dave Houghton, took over as coach of the West Indies. Australias Shaun Williams has been in charge of the Bangladesh team on a temporary basis since Sri Lanka-born Australian Dav Whatmore declined to renew his contract in May. Siddons, who was a senior coach for Australia since 2005 and most recently the sides assistant coach, appeared in one one-day International for Australia against Pakistan in 1988. A former batsman for Victoria and South Australia, he also played Australian Rules football. (Reuters)

 Status quo a possibility
Cricket manager, not full-time coachLOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI		Still looking for 		 Greg rsquo;s successorMumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) may continue with the arrangement of a cricket manager in the next series too  at home, against Pakistan. Time is again short... We can only begin to think of somebody after the Australians have finished their tour (last match on October 20)... But, by then, Pakistans arrival will be days away... So, the present arrangement may continue, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph. Shoaib Maliks team arrives on November 1, with the first ODI a mere four days later. The Sachin Tendulkars havent had a full-time coach after Greg Chappell decided not to seek an extension of his contract. That was six months ago and the players have since worked with three cricket managers  Ravi Shastri, Chandu Borde and Lalchand Rajput. Rajput is likely to get an extension if the BCCI decides to maintain status quo.

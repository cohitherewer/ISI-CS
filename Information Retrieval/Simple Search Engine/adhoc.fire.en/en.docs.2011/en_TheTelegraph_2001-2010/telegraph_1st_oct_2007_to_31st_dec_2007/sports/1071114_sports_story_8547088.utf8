 Galaxy rule out Becks Premiership comeback 
Vicki Hodges David Beckham Los Angeles Galaxy have said David Beckham will not be allowed to return to the Premier League on loan during the winter break in America. The Major League Soccer club want the England international to remain in America to rest and avoid suffering another injury setback ahead of the new season which does not get under way until April. Beckhams switch to America from Real Madrid has been hampered by injury since his arrival last July. The 32-year-old missed much of the season due to an ankle problem he sustained shortly before joining his new club only to pick up a knee injury at the end of August which kept him sidelined for a further six weeks. Several Premier League clubs were thought to be interested in bringing the ex-Manchester United winger back to England during the winter break, but LA Galaxy owner Tim Leiweke has ruled out such a move. It will never happen. David is our property. For David to play in England in the off-season is not in his best interests or ours, Leiweke was quoted in a daily. He needs rest. We have to be careful he doesnt get injured again. Beckham is currently with the England squad who are preparing for their friendly in Austria on Friday evening before they face their potentially crucial final Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia at Wembley next week. It was thought that the LA Galaxy would allow Beckham to train with an English club to keep up his fitness during the long break. Ipswich and Watford had been two clubs who were thought to have expressed an interest in allowing the midfielder to utilise their facilities, but the Galaxy have since ruled out such a move. Beckham had earlier said that he will keep himself active through the winter months after the Galaxys season came to a premature end following their 0-1 loss against Chicago Fire. The Galaxy needed to win to claim a Major League Soccer play-off but former Manchester United trainee John Thorrington scored a 93rd-minute goal for the hosts as they snatched the final play-off berth.

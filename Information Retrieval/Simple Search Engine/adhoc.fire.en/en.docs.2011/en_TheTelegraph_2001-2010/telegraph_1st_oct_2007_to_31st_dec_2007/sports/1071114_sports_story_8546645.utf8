 BCCI wants Asia Cup to be postponed
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will seek a postponement of the Asia Cup when the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) meets next month, according to BCCI president Sharad Pawar. This is to avoid a clash with the BCCIs Twenty20 venture  Indian Premier League (IPL). Both the tournaments are scheduled for April 2008. There is an ACC meeting next month and we would make a request to postpone the Asia Cup till June 2008, Pawar said after a meeting of the BCCI office-bearers in the capital on Tuesday. With India being a major player in the Asia Cup, the BCCI request is likely to be granted. It would pave the way for the launch of IPLs inaugural edition. Pawar said a meeting of the IPL governing council has been convened on Saturday in Jaipur, a day before the fifth ODI between India and Pakistan to discuss about the television rights. The meeting will discuss the media rights presentation and players agreement ratification, said the Board president. More than 40 players have already joined the IPL, he added. Pawar also made it clear that Team India will have a new cricket manager for the tour of Australia. He scotched speculation that Dav Whatmore is in the race for the coachs job. No (hes not in the race). He has already been appointed, he said. The present cricket manager, Lalchand Rajput, will stay on till the Pakistan series, he said. The committee formed to appoint the coach would meet soon.

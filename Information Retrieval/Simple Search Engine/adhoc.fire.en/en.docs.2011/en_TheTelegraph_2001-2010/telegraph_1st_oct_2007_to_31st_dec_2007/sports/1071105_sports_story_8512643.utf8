 Shiv Kapur tied eighth 
Sentosa: Shiv Kapur was on course for a top five finish at the Singapore Open on Sunday before a hattrick of bogeys on the back stretch dashed his hopes. He carded a final round three-over 74 to finish tied eighth with a four-day total of two-over 286 along with Mark Brown and Ken Webber. US Open champion Angel Cabrera (72) staved off a late charge from Vijai Singh to win by one shot. Among other Indians, Calcutta pro S.S.P. Chowrasia carded a 74 to finish tied 23rd. In Sotogrande, Jyoti Randhawa carded a three-over 74 to slide to tied eighth while an identical score by defending champion Jeev Milkha Singh pushed him to tied 29th after the penultimate round of the Volvo Masters on Saturday. Arjun Atwal carded a four-under 67 and lift himself to tied 50th after Round III in the Nationwide Tour Championship at Barona Creek.  (PTI)

 Foreign boost for I-League teams
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee decided on Friday to allow all teams to recruit four foreigners instead of three for the I-League, beginning November 24. The teams were allowed to recruit three foreign players till the last season. The I-League, promising a more professional look, is to replace the National Football League from this season. Each team now can recruit four foreigners and register three for a particular match, said an executive committee member. This change was proposed by AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and was supported by all members in the meeting, he added. The latest development is a bit surprising in that the federation, for the past few years, had been talking about reducing the number of foreigners in Indian football to encourage local talent. The I-League winners will receive Rs. 50 lakh, while the runners-up will be richer by Rs 28 lakh. Winners of every match will receive Rs 35,000, five thousands more than the last seasons figure. The AIFF is likely to scrap prize money for teams finishing from the fourth to sixth spots. The I-League, which will be kicked off by film star John Abraham in Goa, will have a mascot in the shape of a snail. It has been named Foot Zee. The federation has also coined a slogan for promotion of the league  Get bitten by the football bug. The participating teams will have some extra responsibilities in the I-League. All clubs will be given 90 per cent of tickets for sale during their home matches. The rest will be sold by the local association. In a move to nurture local talent, the AIFF has decided to give the clubs Rs 5 lakh for raising their junior teams and paving the way for kick-starting the under-19 league. The tournament had to be put on hold for the past couple of years since there was no taker for it. East Bengal will kick off the I-Leagues city leg against Viva Kerala on November 25. The match will be held at Barasat stadium. This will be followed by Mohun Bagan-JCT match the next day.

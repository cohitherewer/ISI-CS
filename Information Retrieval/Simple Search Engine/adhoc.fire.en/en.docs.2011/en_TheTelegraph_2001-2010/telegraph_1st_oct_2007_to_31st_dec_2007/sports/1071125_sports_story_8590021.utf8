 Weve a good chance: Harbhajan 
 - Wicket is playing better... We are ready to chase any target, says Indian spinner OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Harbhajan Singh celebrates after dismissing Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik on Day III of the first Test at the Kotla on Saturday. (PTI) New Delhi: Harbhajan Singh on Saturday exuded confidence about Indias victory in the first Test at the Kotla. According to the off-spinner, the wicket which didnt help the batsmen for the first two days, showed signs of improvement, brightening India s chance of winning the match. We have a good chance since the wicket is playing better, even though we have to bat in the final innings. We are hoping for a better tomorrow, said Harbhajan, who dismissed Mohammed Yousuf and Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik in the post-tea session on Saturday. The way partnerships went today it did not feel like the same wicket we played on yesterday, he added, referring to the sixth-wicket stand between Kamran Akmal and Misbah-ul Haq. We are not unduly worried. The kind of team we have, we should face no problem in winning this match. We are ready to chase any target, he pointed out. According to him, Indian bowlers bowled extremely well to restrict Pakistan to 212 for five at Day III stumps, an overall lead of 167. There is no life on the wicket, still our bowlers have bowled very well, he said. Asked about his own performance, the spinner said he did not feel he was under-bowled. Like everyone, I too like to bowl in long spells. But it is up to the captain to choose his bowlers. I think he (Anil Kumble) called me up at the right time. Harbhajan agreed that a wicket in the first ball of his second spell gave him the much needed confidence. When you get a wicket in the first ball, your morale is bound to go up. It also happened to me when I dismissed Yousuf. Harbhajan felt India would have been in a much better position had Misbah not given a reprieve. If Wasim Jaffer had held the chance, maybe they would have been seven, eight, nine or even all out, Harbhajan said. But thats part of cricket. We are not ruing over it.

				 Houghton on right track 

Free Kick
 
PK Banerjee
The year just about to pass us by will be remembered in Indian football for the Nehru Cup triumph. It was significant on two counts  we had never won this tournament which started 25 years ago and also, we had not won an international championship since the LG Cup in Vietnam five years ago.
																								None of the top Asian guns participated in the Nehru Cup. Three of the teams we beat  Kyrgyzstan, Bangladesh and Cambodia  were either inferior or of the same standard as ours. Only Syria  who we lost to in the league stage and beat in the final  occupied a higher berth in the Fifa list. So the real value of the success can be debated.
																								I dont want to sound negative because beggars cant be choosers. At a time when we had forgotten to win matches, leave alone tournaments, it was definitely an achievement to win those four matches.
																								The Indian team also had a very good tour of Portugal before the Nehru Cup. We remained unbeaten in four matches, winning one and drawing the rest. It may again be argued that our national team played three third division and one second division side on that tour, but its the bottomline which mattered more than the quality of opposition we faced.
																								This is where I give Bob Houghton high marks. The experienced Englishman realised that the first step in his job of taking Indian football forward was to inculcate the winning habit, or get rid of the losing habit. The Portugal trip was his brainchild and I would say it was a masterstroke. Four matches in a top flight European nation gave our boys added confidence going into the Nehru Cup.
																								Houghton also managed to convince the AIFF brass that the camp for the national team had to be a long affair. For the first time, we had a 40-day camp with players from all clubs.
																								The 1-4 loss against Lebanon in the World Cup qualifier in Beirut was perhaps the biggest disappointment of 2007. We faced players superior in build and height, but I felt it was a match we should have at least drawn, and then gone for the kill at home. The Lebanese, after all, dont have the skills of the Koreans or the Japanese.
																								That one blot notwithstanding, we must stick to Houghton for at least three years. He has to be given sufficient time to implement his ideas which will fetch the desired results.
																								Our world ranking improved 14 slots to 143, but Im sure Houghton has his eyes set higher. Anywhere around 100 should be the next practical target.
																								Some individuals stood tall with their consistent performances during the year. The three I would like to pick are Subrata Paul, Mahesh Gawli and N. P. Pradeep.
																								Subrata, in my opinion, is one of our best finds in recent years. He is a very courageous young man and does not have the fear of life. Thats the most important attribute a goalkeeper should have. Some of the saves he pulled off were quite outstanding. The only problem is, he is prone to letting in some soft goals, but that can be rectified.
																								Gawli is a very dependable defender whose solidity is an asset for the national team as well as Dempo. His quality of interceptions can be the envy of most Indian defenders. He can also snatch the ball from any part of the field.
																								N.P. Pradeep is another player who has impressed me. Houghton has been using him as a midfielder, but Pradeep is an all-purpose footballer who can carry out any role. He can take powerful long-rangers to catch any defence napping. It was his goal which won us the Nehru Cup.
																								At the club level, the slide of the once powerful Calcutta teams continued. Dempo won their second straight National League crown. East Bengal managed fifth place and Mohun Bagan a lowly eighth after being in relegation zone for some time.
																								East Bengal did win the Federation Cup this season, but now that the National league (renamed the I-League) for 2007-08 has started, its back to square one: both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan are struggling.
																								The one most disturbing development is the four-foreigner rule in the I-League. Three were bad enough, one extra man means less scope for Indians. These second or third grade foreigners are turning out to be trump card for the clubs and fetching them trophies. They are also blocking key positions like strikers and central defenders, where we need to develop Indian talent.
																								The sooner we can lessen our dependence on these foreigners the better it will be for Indian football.
																								My pick 
																								Subrata Paul: One of our 
																								 best finds in recent years, he is 
																							 a courageous young goalkeeper. Some of the saves he pulled off were quite outstanding
																								Mahesh Gawli: A dependable defender whose solidity is an asset for the national team as well as Dempo. His quality of interceptions can be the envy of most Indian defenders

																								 N.P. Pradeep: Though Houghton has been using him 
																								 as a midfielder, Pradeep is an 

																								 all-purpose footballer who can 
																								 carry out any role. His powerful 
																								 long-rangers are a treat to watch

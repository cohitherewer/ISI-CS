 Manju returns today

A STAFF REPORTER
Calcutta: After their losses to Viva Kerala and JCT, Mohun Bagan will be under pressure when they take on fancied Air India in their fourth round ONGC I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium Saturday. 
The entire team is under pressure, Mohun Bagan coach Roberto Carlos Pereira said after their practice on Friday. N.S. Manju is set to return to the squad while Jose Ramirez Barreto will operate from a bit deep. P.C. Lalawmpuia will partner Bhaichung Bhutia up front. 
No one knows better than Pereira that it is high time for them to win, which will boost the confidence of the side. I hope everyone is feeling the heat, and not only me. They all will have to come out as a cohesive unit tomorrow, Pereira said. He also felt that the match might well be their chance to make a comeback. 
Brazilian star Barreto also vowed to come back strongly. I am motivated to play better tomorrow and I know this team has the capability, he said. 
Placed eighth among 10 teams, Mohun Bagan have one point from the draw versus Sporting Clube de Goa. Their opponents are placed fifth with three draws (vs Mahindra, Salgaocar and Viva Kerala). In the absence of injured Suley Musah, Air India are banking on their youth brigade as players like Covan Lawrence, Jiten Rai will play a crucial role. 
Not underestimating their opponents, Air India coach Bimal Ghosh said: We have a side full of youth and I can assure you that they would put up a good fight.

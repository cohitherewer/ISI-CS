 9 teams left scrambling for four slots
London: The remaining four Euro 2008 finals slots should be decided on Wednesday with nine teams still harbouring hopes of filling them. However, it will be something of a surprise if England, Portugal, Sweden and Turkey fail to advance to next years tournament in Switzerland and Austria where all the continents leading sides should be on duty despite some mid-campaign wobbles that threatened the old order. Portugal, runners-up on home soil in 2004, need only one point from their home game against Finland to go through behind Poland from group A. Weekend snow in Belgrade led to two postponements of Serbias game against Kazakhstan  which will now be played on Saturday  while they host Poland on Wednesday. If Portugal lose, two wins would send Serbia through. Things are more clear-cut in group E where England need a point from their Wembley meeting with Croatia to join their opponents in the finals. Sweden also need a home draw, against Latvia, to go through from group F but even if they lose they would only miss out if Northern Ireland beat already-qualified Spain away. Turkey, who pulled off a terrific 2-1 win in Norway on Saturday to regain the initiative in group C behind Greece, should complete the qualifying quartet. With Austria, Switzerland and holders Greece filling three of the four top seed positions, there is an advantage in being placed in the second pot to earn a theoretically easier group. France, Italy, Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Croatia, Poland, Romania and The Netherlands have already qualified.  (AGENCIES)

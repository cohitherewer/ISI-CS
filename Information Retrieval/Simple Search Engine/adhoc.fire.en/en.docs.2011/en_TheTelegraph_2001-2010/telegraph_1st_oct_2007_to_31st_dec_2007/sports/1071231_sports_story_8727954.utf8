 Tatiana leads France to victory

Perth: Rising star Tatiana Golovin led France to a 2-1 victory over Argentina in their opening group A Hopman Cup tie on Sunday. 
The teenager set the fourth-seeded French on the path to victory with a straight-set singles win over an ailing Gisela Dulko. 
Although Juan Ignacio Chela levelled the tie by thrashing Arnaud Clement, the French pairing were far too good in the deciding mixed doubles, setting up a pivotal clash with top seeds Serbia on Wednesday. 
France has never won the Hopman Cup, but the clash with the Serbian pair of Novak Djokovic and Jelena Jankovic is likely to decide which nation reaches Fridays final. 
Golovin agreed that Wednesdays tie is crucial and said she is looking forward to playing the Serbians. It was important to get the first win against Argentina, she said. 
Meanwhile, Jelena Jankovic and Novak Djokovic won their singles matches against Taiwan to give top-seeded Serbia a winning start. Jankovic defeated Hsieh su-Wei 6-4, 6-4 while Djokovic, who struggled with a back injury in the second set, rallied to beat Lu yen-Hsun 7-5, 2-6,6-3. With the match clinched, Serbia claimed a 3-0 win when Jankovic and Djokovic beat Hsieh and Lu 3-6, 6-2, 10-8 in mixed doubles.

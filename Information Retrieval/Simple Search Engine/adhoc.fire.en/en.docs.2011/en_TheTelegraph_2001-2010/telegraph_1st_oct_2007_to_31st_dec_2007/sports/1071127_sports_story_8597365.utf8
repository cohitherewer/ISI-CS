 United to unleash Portuguese duo
			Cristiano Ronaldo at practice on Monday		Manchester: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson will again unleash Portuguese duo Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani against their former club Sporting in Tuesdays Champions League tie at Old Trafford. Ronaldo, the match-winner in Lisbon in September, was rested for Uniteds shock Premier league defeat by Bolton on Saturday but will return for the group F tie as Fergusons side looks to extend their 100 per cent record to five games. I dont normally give my team out but I can tell you there will be two Portuguese players playing tomorrow (Tuesday), Ferguson told a news conference on Monday. Ronaldo is already established as a key player in Uniteds pursuit of a first Champions League success since 1999 and Ferguson also hailed the impact fellow winger Nani, 20, has made since following his Portugal international team mate to Old Trafford from Sporting in the close season. Were very pleased with Nanis performances, Ferguson added. As a young boy he has settled in very well and hes showing almost every week there is an improvement so I cant be more delighted than I am with his start at the club. Ferguson also confirmed that Tomasz Kuszczak will start in goal and there will be places in his side for midfielders Darren Fletcher and John Shea, while defender Nemanja Vidic is also fit to return after missing the 1-0 defeat at Bolton. The United manager may include some young players on the bench but will not weaken his team for a game that could end Sportings qualification hopes and take United through as group winners. I think the incentives are huge for us. If we win, we win the group and therefore look forward to being seeded number one from the group for next Februarys knockout stage. I think thats important, Ferguson said. A United victory would also allow Ferguson to rest players for the subsequent dead game against AS Roma in Rome ahead of Uniteds important league game against Liverpool on December 16. Ferguson is also looking for a positive response to Saturdays loss at Bolton when United were beaten in the league for only the second time this season. Its always important how you recover. Its never been any different and over the years I think weve coped with that quite well, he added. I am sure Sporting expect us to attack them and be positive and Im sure 75,000 fans will also expect us to be positive and I dont think we will let them down. Striker Wayne Rooney, defender Gary Neville and midfielder Paul Scholes are all still absent for United. Some other top clubs will seek to clear some of the last remaining obstacles to join Arsenal and Manchester United in the last-16. For reigning champions Milan, Barcelona and Real Madrid one point will suffice but for others, notably five-time European champions Liverpool, the journey has become a white-knuckle ride with no more margin for error. Two defeats and a draw from their first three matches in group A left Liverpool in the mire and needing a Houdini-like escape act to stay alive. Three victories were required and while Besiktas were duly thumped a record 8-0 at Anfield in the last round of fixtures, group leaders Porto will prove a far sterner test on what will be a highly-charged night at Anfield on Wednesday. The slick Portuguese can secure their place in the knockout round with a victory, although a draw would be sufficient as long as Besiktas do not beat second-placed Marseille. Steven Gerrards form in the 3-0 win at Newcastle United on Saturday bodes well for Liverpool but they will need another barnstorming display from their skipper. Valencias prospects are even bleaker than Liverpools as their fate is not even in their own hands after a desperately disappointing campaign in group B. They sit bottom with three points and must beat Schalke, one of three struggling German clubs, at home on Wednesday to have any chance of making progress. Group leaders Chelsea will be wary of a trip to surprise package Rosenborg after the Norwegians drew at Stamford Bridge and beat Valencia home and away to sit second. Victory would send Chelsea through but Rosenborg will be fired up with a last-16 place within touching distance. Sevilla will be hoping Arsenal rest some of their big names when they host the already-qualified English leaders. (Reuters)

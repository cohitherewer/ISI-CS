 Barry: I dont envy Dhoni
 - Its very tough being captain and keeper, says iconic South African LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Barry Richards Kochi: There havent been many wicketkeeper-captains and, in Barry Richards view, thats because its very tough to do both jobs. I dont envy (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni as its very tough being captain and keeper A wicketkeeper cant switch off, for hes got to be there on every ball, the iconic South African told The Telegraph. Dhoni, who captained India to victory in the World Twenty20, has been retained till the end of the ODIs against Pakistan  a run of 12 matches, with the first seven versus world champions Australia. In the past, Syed Kirmani has been the only keeper to have led India. He did so in one ODI, that too in a stand-in capacity. Barry, who is in India on a TV assignment, added: Because of the heavy demands placed on wicketkeeper-captains, I wouldnt favour a keeper getting the captaincy for any length of time Fact, of course, is that Dhoni is in the running to captain Team India in Test cricket as well.

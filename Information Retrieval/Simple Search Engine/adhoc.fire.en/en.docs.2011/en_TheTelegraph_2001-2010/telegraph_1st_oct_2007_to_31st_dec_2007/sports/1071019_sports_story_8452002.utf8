 Guus Hiddink tipped for England job 
THE DAILY TELEGRAPHGuus Hiddink is the bookmakers favourite to become the next England manager. Skybet are offering odds of 5/1 on the Dutchman replacing Steve McClaren. Russia rallied to beat England 2-1 at the Luzhniki Stadium on Thursday. That result has jeopardised Englands chances of qualifying for the tournament and seriously undermined the position of McClaren. Hiddink has been linked with the England job in the past, though the FA denied that they ever offered him the opportunity to succeed Sven-Goran Eriksson. Other potential candidates include Stuart Pearce (6/1), Jose Mourinho (7/1) and Martin Neill (8/1). Hiddink, meanwhile, attacked McClarens tactics in Moscow. He said: You could see in the first half that we had two strikers and they were playing with Lescott rather inside as a central defender with Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell. In the first half we had a lot of space on the right side and so we could penetrate there, although our attacking was not fine tuned, we still had that threat. Im not even thinking about losing my job. Im really not, McClaren said. The group is decided after 12 games. Russia have got two to play and we have got one. We are hugely disappointed to lose a football match we were controlling but beyond that, I am not thinking about losing my job.

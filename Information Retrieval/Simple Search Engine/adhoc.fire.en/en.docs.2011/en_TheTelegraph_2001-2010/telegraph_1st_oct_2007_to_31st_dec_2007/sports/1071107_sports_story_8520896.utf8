 A Diwali gift, says Barreto
A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto described his two goals against East Bengal as a Diwali gift for his teammates and fans, warning though that they had still some unfinished job in claiming the CFL Premier Division title. Yes, its a gift not only for my fans, but also for my players without whose support we could not have beaten East Bengal twice in the league, the Brazilian said after the match on Tuesday. But we have still two matches to play (against Peerless on November 12 and Mohammedan Sporting on November 16), so I dont want to celebrate the occasion right now. Barreto, leading the goalscorers list with 14 goals, also refused to dub his performance an answer to his critics, who had earlier doubted about his agility and effectiveness. Let people talk about me and I will keep answering them with my feet, he said. His captain Bhaichung Bhutia, however, warned the rivals of his combination with Barreto. When we had played together in 2002 it didnt click, but I believe it will be a different story this season, he said. Talking about the teams struggling first half, Bhaichung pointed out that the strategy was not to concede a goal as we knew East Bengal would come back hard at us because their urgency (for a win) was more than us. East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya tried to put up a brave face, picking Surkumar Singhs injury as the turning point. Its nothing but a bad day in office. Surkumars injury was crucial since I had to reshuffle my defence and middle-third. I wanted to win the match very much, but at the end of the day, you cant get everything you wish for, he said.

 Coach selection meeting on Nov. 3
Mumbai: After being without a coach for seven months, the cricket Board has decided to choose Greg Chappells successor and has convened a meeting of the coach selection committee here next week. The coach selection committee (for the national team) will meet in Mumbai on November 3, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said. Former Australian captain Chappell did not seek a renewal of his contract following Indias disastrous ow in the World Cup and later the team had functioned with cricket managers. The matter of appointing a new coach for the team was put on hold after the BCCIs decision in choosing Graham Ford backfired when the South African turned down the offer in June after initially accepting it. Then the BCCI decided to invite applications for the job, but despite receiving more than a dozen of CVs, preferred to play the waiting game till the end of the series against Australia. The meeting of the special committee, headed by BCCI chief Sharad Pawar and comprising the Boards principal office-bearers along with ex-Test captains S. Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri, is to be held two days before Indias opening ODI against Pakistan in Guwahati. Shah said the BCCI officials would also utilise the opportunity to hold discussions with newly-appointed director of the National Cricket Academy, Dav Whatmore, over the academys set-up.  (PTI)

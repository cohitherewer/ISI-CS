 Lara in talks with IPL
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Brian Lara Jaipur: The iconic Brian Lara is in a dialogue with the Indian Premier League (IPL), but he has been told that nothing concrete will be done as long as hes on contract with the breakaway Indian Cricket League (ICL). Lara has approached us and a dialogue has taken place. However, we dont want to be accused of encouraging players to renege on contracts. For anything concrete to emerge, Lara must first sort out his contract with the ICL, is what somebody associated with the officially sanctioned IPL had to say. According to the gentleman, who spoke to The Telegraph on Sunday, Lara probably feels let down by the ICL, whose chairman is the legendary Kapil Dev. Apparently Lara, who quit international cricket after the World Cup, was given to understand that some of the biggest names had already joined and, so, the leagues profile would be high. The reality is that the big guns have been queuing to join the IPL, which was launched quite some months after the ICLs birth. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf, is understood to have been briefed on the modalities of starting a league on the lines of the IPL. Dr Ashraf is in India for a couple of days and may return during the latter part of the three-Test series, which begins on Thursday.

 Hogg will do well vs India: Warne

 Shane Warne 
Melbourne: Spin legend Shane Warne said Brad Hogg has done well against India in the one dayers and there is no reason why he cant do it against them in the forthcoming Test series as well. 
Warne admitted supple wrists and nimble footwork of the Indian batsmen make them the best player of spin bowling but still believes Hogg would make his mark in the Test series. 
India play the spinners extremely well, but Australian pitches are different. There is a lot of extra bounce and he (Hogg) can still have an impact. Its not low, slow, big-turning wickets. Its fast, bounce and not much turn, Warne told a newspaper. 
Harbhajan Singh has already dared Australia to field Hogg, warning the spinner might be clobbered by his batting colleagues. 
Rival captain Ricky Ponting picked up the gauntlet and invited India to have a go at the spinner. 
Warne, meanwhile, conceded that against India, he did not do as well as he had done against other countries but insisted it was not too bad either. 
I think Hoggy will do well. They played me pretty well on the whole but I still had success against them. 
Warnes optimism stems from the fact that Hogg did reasonably well in the ODI series against India and his advice was to stick to the same game plan. 
You know they are going to play spin well and you are going to be under the pump a little bit. But the way he (Hogg) has played in one-day cricket is how he should bowl in Test cricket.

 Moores hints at going with Broad

 Mahela Jayawardene 
Hotter and more humid than Kandy, and played on a pitch where Muttiah Muralidharan has taken 143 of his 713 wickets, England face a massive task in Colombo if they are to win the second Test and level the series. 
Not many cricketing challenges require a greater effort, especially now that Sri Lanka possess the top-ranked batsman in world cricket, Kumar Sangakkara, as well as the leading bowler, Muralidharan. And as Michael Vaughans team prepare to strain every sinew over the next five days in search of victory, history reveals that England are not too handy at overturning early deficits abroad. 
If you ignore Ashes series in Australia, which have all been lost since 1986-7, England have found themselves behind early on in nine away series over the last 20 years. But while the team fought back heroically during the final Test to draw level in India two years ago, they have only once bounced back to win the series  against Sri Lanka six years ago. 
That comeback was touted as one of the great triumphs of the Duncan Fletcher era, so the current coach will be under no illusions as to what is required. As then, Muralidharan poses a constant threat. 
Unless the pitch looks like loosening, and Graeme Swann gets in as second spinner, the main contest for Hoggards place will be between Steve Harmison and Stuart Broad, with James Anderson joining the debate after proving expensive in the opening Test. Theres no doubt Stuart has done really well, Moores said Friday. He had a good one-day series here, adapting well to the conditions. But the challenge has always been picking the right moment to release him into Test cricket. Although I think hes ready, bowling three spells a day over a five-day Test will be pushing his physical limits, but hes mentally strong.

 Open verdict on Woolmer
 Woolmer Kingston: A Jamaican inquest into the death of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer failed on Wednesday to determine his cause of death, leaving a mystery that gripped the international cricket world unresolved. An 11-member jury said it had not seen enough evidence in the month-long inquest to decide whether Woolmer was murdered or died of natural causes in March during the World Cup in the Caribbean, a day after his team suffered a humiliating defeat to Ireland. The death stunned cricket aficionados, especially after Jamaican police launched a murder investigation. Suspicions immediately fell on illegal betting cartels or irate fans. But three months later, Jamaican police abandoned the murder probe when three overseas pathologists determined the former England international had been very sick and died of natural causes. The official inquest had been expected to deliver the definitive conclusion. Instead, the jury said it had reached an open verdict. The evidence presented was weak, said the foreman of the jury, who asked not to be identified. There were too many ifs and buts and what ifs. It just was not conclusive. We were insisting that we come to a unanimous verdict and we deliberated among ourselves and arrived at what we think was the right verdict. The cause of death now legally lies in the hands of Jamaicas director of public prosecutions, Kent Pantry. He has yet to say whether he will make a determination. Coroner Patrick Murphy, who presided over the inquiry, said that another inquest was not possible. Youve done your job, thank you very much. The inquest is now over and you are excused, Murphy told the jury. (REUTERS)ICC Statement The International Cricket Council (ICC) notes the decision of the coroners court in Jamaica to return an open verdict in the case relating to the death of Bob Woolmer.It is a matter of great sadness for everyone within the cricket community around the world who knew and respected Bob as a fine player and, more recently, as a great coach. Our thoughts remain with his family and friends who are still grieving their loss.It is important to note that, following an exhaustive police investigation, no credible evidence has been produced to prove that there was any foul play connected to Bobs death.Also, no motive or suspect for any crime to do with his death has been established while three expert and independent forensic pathologists told the court that Bob most likely died from natural causes related to heart disease.It should also be noted that extensive investigations by the Jamaican Constabulary Force (JCF) and the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit found no evidence of match-fixing or corruption of any kind related in this case.As has been the case throughout this matter, the ICC will continue to lend any assistance it can to the JCF should it be required to do so.

 Crouch chases iconic goal
Henry Winter Peter Crouch Some goals pay the rent. Others ensure the country is forever in the goalscorers debt. From Paul Mariner to Gary Lineker and David Beckham, those men whose goals have guaranteed tournament participation are revered. At Wembley on Wednesday, Peter Crouch wants to join those celebrated names. A clean sheet against Croatia will carry England through to Euro 2008, but such is the attacking threat posed by a visiting team boasting Eduardo, Luka Modric and Niko Kranjcar, that England will probably need a goal. Any player picked on Wednesday has a huge chance to be a hero and put England through, Crouch said. It is something I dream of. Final qualifiers have conjured up constant drama for England. Mariners moment came against Hungary in 1981. Lineker pounced against Poland in 1991. Beckhams free-kick swerved over Greeces wall in 2001. Crouch wants to be remembered for similar iconic moments. His 13 goals in 23 internationals is an impressive return, but he requires a real headline-grabber to secure his place in the England history books. Sitting at the Grove, in Hertfordshire, on Monday afternoon, training complete, Crouch talked eloquently and intelligently about his craft. He started by addressing what he is remembered for with England. Apart from a silly dance? smiled Crouch. There have been a great few moments for me and Ive been very proud of my goalscoring record, but I havent had the chance to play in a defining match, one that gets us to a finals. Wednesday is my chance. I was fortunate enough to get a goal in my first big tournament, the World Cup last year. I would have liked to score the goals that Michael Owen has scored, to be remembered like that, scoring in massive games in the World Cup  or David Beckham against Greece. I would love that to be me against Croatia  but if it is somebody else, that is good as well. A sense of relief flowed through Crouch that Wednesdays was a live game, thanks to Omer Golans late, late strike for Israel against Russia in Tel Aviv.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Malik counts the positives 
 Shoaib Malik Lahore: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik is in positive mood, despite his teams Test and one-day series defeat to South Africa, which he says will help them prepare for a tough Indian tour. We are disappointed to have lost a chance to win the series but the guys tried hard and we will learn from our mistakes for the Indian tour. If anything it is good we lost because now we can learn and be better prepared for the Indian tour which is always a pressure one for us, Malik said on Tuesday. We do not go there with any negative thoughts in our mind, he added. Pakistan will face India in five one-day Internationals and three Tests. Their first one-dayer will take place in Guwahati on November 5. Pakistan were defeated in their five-match one-day series to South Africa on Monday 2-3 after losing the final game by 14-runs. South Africa also won the Test series 1-0. Malik insisted his team did not cave in under pressure and said no one was to blame for the defeat. We batted irresponsibly in the final match after a solid start. Our finishing has to improve for sure. I dont want to blame anyone because everyone tried their best. One result does not mean we are chokers, he added. Malik said the return of rebellious strike bowler Shoaib Akhtar was a big boost for the team. He is always an asset for the team and a top bowler if he is 100 per cent fit. It is good he bowled so well having played after such a long time. It is a good sign for the Indian series. Malik also backed wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal whose skills behind the wickets have been criticised severely in recent times. Look anyone can drop catches even Jonty Rhodes dropped catches. But we know Akmal is a bit down and we need to talk to him and boost his confidence. We know he can be a key player for us in India, he remarked. Akmal dropped a straight forward chance of Jacques Kallis, who went on to make a match winning 86 for his team in the final one-dayer.  (AGENCIES)

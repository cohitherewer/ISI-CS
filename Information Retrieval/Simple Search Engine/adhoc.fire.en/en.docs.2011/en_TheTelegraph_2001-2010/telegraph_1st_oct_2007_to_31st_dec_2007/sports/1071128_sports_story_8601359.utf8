 Mixed luck for Bopanna
New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna had mixed luck at the ONGC ATP Challenger tournament on Tuesday. He lost his singles Round I encounter against second-seeded Igor Kunitsyn of Russia but came back strongly to win his second round doubles match partnering Pakistans Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi. They beat Indias Stephen Amritraj and Cecil Mamiit of Philippines 6-2, 6-4. Bopanna, on his way to script an upset, lost three match points and handed the Russian a 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 win at the DLTA courts. The fall of the big-serving Bopanna marked the end of the Indian challenge in the singles of $50,000 hardcourt event as Harsh Mankad and Karan Rastogi had lost their opening round encounters earlier on Tuesday. Mankad went down 7-5, 6-2 to Alberto Francis of the US while Rastogi found the going tough and lost 6-3, 6-3 against Wesley Moodie of South Africa. Other Indian challengers Tushar Liberhan, Prajnesh Gunneswaran, Sunil Kumar Sipaeya and Navdeep Singh had been eliminated on Monday. Among others, Pakistans Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi, seeded sixth, had to toil hard for a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 victory against Ivan Sergeyev of Ukraine. Bopanna did everything in his endeavour to win the match but tripped on the verge of victory. After pocketing the first set and leading 5-4 in the second, the Davis Cupper lost three match points in the next game on his own serve. (PTI)

 Mary Ann in joint lead 
 Mary Ann Gomes Antalya (Turkey): Indias Kiran Manisha Mohanty and compatriot Mary Ann Gomes were in joint lead after Round III of the under-18 section of World Youth Girls Chess Championship here. Showing her much improved positional sense Kiran, who recently finished second in the National Women Championship, was a cut above Yulduz Hamrakulova of Uzbekistan and even though it was a prolonged battle in the Ruy Lopez closed game, the result was never in doubt once the Indian had control. The game lasted 76 moves. Earlier in the day, Mary Ann also registered an emphatic victory over Madina Davletbayeva of Kazakhstan in a Sicilian defence game where the former played black. Up against the Alapin variation, Mary Ann displayed her best tactics and launched an attack against the black king in quick time in the early middle game. Davletbayeva did not have a clue as Mary Anns pieces started to roll and it was all over in just 30 moves. In the under-14 girls J. Mohana Priya also continued with her fine run and defeated Irina Bulmaga of Moldova in 69 moves. (PTI)

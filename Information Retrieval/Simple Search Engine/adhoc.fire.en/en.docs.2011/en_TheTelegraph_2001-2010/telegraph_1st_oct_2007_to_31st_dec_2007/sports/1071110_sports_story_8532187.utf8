 Italian under investigation 
Milan: Italys Alessio Di Mauro is under investigation for betting on other players matches, the Italian Tennis Federation has said. The world No. 124, who made the first round of the Australian and French Opens this year, could face a three-year ban and a large fine if found guilty of online gambling. He has an online account, it is a personal account. It is a new thing, we are still waiting for the ATP but sanctions are possible, an Italian tennis federation spokeswoman said on Friday, adding he had not bet on his own matches. The ATP has refused to comment. Di Mauro, 30, gained a ranking high of 68 in February after reaching his first ATP final in Buenos Aires, where he lost to Argentinas Juan Monaco. Tennis is cracking down on betting after a troubled period for the sport. (Reuters)

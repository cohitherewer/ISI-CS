 Murray not surprised by match-fixing talk
TIMES ONLINE AMP; AGENCIES Andy Murray Andy Murray, the British No. 1, believes players on the tennis circuit are involved in match-fixing. Top stars like Murray scarcely need the money reportedly on offer from crooked betting rings, but the 20-year-old fears the temptation to cheat is too great for players who struggle to make a living in the professional game.  It doesnt really surprise me, Murray said. Some guys have to come to tournaments like this every single week and the first-round losers cheque is sort of euro 2,500 and they have got to pay for their air fares and, you know, its only a 10 or 12-year career so you have to make all your money while youre still playing. Murray feels the nature of the sport makes it difficult to prove when someone is trying to engineer an outcome. Its not really acceptable, its difficult to prove if someone has tanked a match or not tried because they can try their best until the last couple of games of each set and then make some mistakes, a couple of double faults, and thats it, he said. Its pretty disappointing for all the players but everyone knows it goes on. The ATP has a zero tolerance policy towards players who become involved in gambling. The ATP is still investigating irregular betting patterns regarding a surprise defeat suffered by top Russian player Nikolay Davydenko in a meet in Poland, in August. The match, which attracted $7 million in bets, 10 times the usual amount, was won by Argentinas Martin Vassallo Arguello 2-6, 6-3, 2-1 with Davydenko retiring with a foot injury. Bookmakers refused to pay out after it emerged that significant bets were laid on a Vassallo victory even after Davydenko won the first set. The Russian denies any wrongdoing. Tennis chiefs, meanwhile, have agreed to set up an integrity unit to combat betting-related corruption. The International Tennis Federation, the Grand Slam Committee and the ATP and WTA Tours are close to finalising the remit of the new unit, according to the ATPs executive chairman Etienne de Villiers. We see the establishment of a dedicated global tennis integrity unit as a key priority for the sport and plans to create one are well advanced, De Villiers said. We have had a number of very constructive meetings on the issue this year and will be meeting again this week, with external experts, to discuss the next steps in ensuring the unit becomes a reality as soon as possible. Since the investigation into the Davydenko match was launched, a number of other players have revealed that they have been approached to throw matches. Gilles Elseneer claimed he was offered euro 100,000 to lose his first-round match at Wimbledon in 2005, while fellow-Belgian Dick Norman revealed he has been asked to provide in-depth information on other players fitness. Former British Davis Cup player Arvind Parmar has also claimed he was offered money to lose a match at a low-key ATP Challenger event.

 Barcelona testing for Force India
London: Italian Vitantonio Liuzzi and Austrian Christian Klien will press their claims for a return to the Formula One starting grid when they test for Force India in Spain next week. The Indian-owned team, formerly Spyker, said in a statement on Saturday that the two racers would join German driver Adrian Sutil at Barcelonas Circuit de Catalunya on November 14 and 15. Dutch test driver Giedo van der Garde and young Spaniard Roldan Rodriguez will open the test for the Ferrari-powered team on November 13. Liuzzi raced for Red Bull in 2005 before switching to sister team Toro Rosso for the past two seasons. The Italian has been replaced by Frances quadruple ChampCar champion Sebastian Bourdais for 2008. The 26-year-old Italian, who won the 2004 F3000 championship, had hoped to find a home at Williams but that door was closed when they confirmed Japanese rookie Kazuki Nakajima this week. Klien, 24, competed for Jaguar in 2004 and Red Bull for the following two seasons. The Austrian has been Hondas test and reserve driver this season but he said in a separate statement that he had reached an agreement with the Japanese team to be allowed to look elsewhere for a race seat. While Force India will be assessing European drivers, Indias Karun Chandhok will also be in Barcelona to test with Red Bull Racing.  (REUTERS)

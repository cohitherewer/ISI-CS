 Goa will suit us, says Bob
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Bob Houghton New Delhi: On Tuesday, when India play Lebanon in the rescheduled World Cup qualifier in Goa, national coach Bob Houghton would turn 60. Houghton was supposed to leave for Bangkok on Monday morning where his family was waiting to celebrate his birthday in a grand fashion. Instead, he had to hastily arrange his baggage and rush to Goa. The Briton, however, is not too disappointed. The sudden turn of events has instead made him confident of a turnaround. He believes his wards can erase the bitter memory of a 1-4 thrashing in Beirut. Houghton never wanted the match to be arranged in Chennai and is now happy that it will be played on familiar turf in Goa. I would have ideally wanted the match in Delhi If not in Goa, said Houghton at the Cuncolim ground where the team had a full-fledged practice session within two hours of arriving in Goa. My boys are quite familiar with the ground at the Nehru Stadium here, he said. Four Goan players would be on the pitch Tuesday. That would be an advantage. Houghton said it would be great to lead 1-0 at the half time but he would not press the panic button if the score remains even at the breather. My boys are capable of scoring at any point of time. Against Cambodia, they scored four goals in the last 20 minutes. We can do it in the second half too. However, captain Bhaichung Bhutia feels Goa as a venue wont provide any added advantage. Firstly, the Lebanese have now got enough time to recover from jet lag. Moreover, they have now acclimatised themselves with the weather. As he said in Chennai, Houghton wants the crowd to come in huge numbers at the Nehru Stadium. Thats necessary, he said. But given the fact that the match had to be arranged in a less than 48-hour notice, Goa Football Association (GFA) secretary Savio Messias is not too confident of having an impressive turnout Tuesday. We could only order the printing of tickets late on Sunday, he said. The sale would start at 11am on Tuesday. We didnt have too much time to do some publicity. Lebanon arrived in Goa at 4pm on Monday after changing flight in Bangalore. Since there was little time left, the visitors preferred to do some light practice on the sea beach near their hotel. The kick off is at 3pm. Lebanon would rush to Mumbai almost immediately to catch a connecting flight to Beirut. India would field the same team that was planned in Chennai.

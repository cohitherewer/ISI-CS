Comfortable travelling without a coach since splitting with the city-based Sanjay Poddar, Rastogi said: Its good to have someone with you on Tour, right now Im happy with my dad travelling with me. 
His finances are secure for the time being. Ive got a sponsor (DHFL of Mumbai) now, I dont have to worry about my expenses now.

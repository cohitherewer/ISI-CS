 US take 2-0 lead vs Russia 
Portland: James Blake earned the United States a commanding 2-0 lead with a gutsy 6-3, 7-6, 6-7, 7-6 victory over Russian Mikhail Youzhny in the second singles match of the Davis Cup final on Friday. American number one Andy Roddick had outclassed Dmitry Tursunov 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 in the opening rubber of the three-day tie at Memorial Coliseum. Blake, who lost to Youzhny in their only previous encounter in last years semi-final, held off a spirited fightback by his opponent in a fluctuating contest lasting three-and-a-half hours. The American world number 13 failed to serve out for the match when leading 5-4 in the fourth set, but he held his nerve to clinch the tiebreak 7-3 when 19th-ranked Youzhny netted a forehand. He played great and hes got a lot more experience than me in situations like this, a jubilant Blake said in a courtside television interview. For me to come through is a big moment for me and for the team. Its definitely my best performance. And playing at home makes it a lot more fun. Blakes victory puts the United States on the brink of a record 32nd Davis Cup title with the dominant Bryan brothers, Bob and Mike, due to take on Nikolay Davydenko and Igor Andreev in Saturdays doubles. The Bryans, winners of five grand slam titles together, have lost just one doubles match in 13 Davis Cup appearances. Big-serving Roddick fired down 25 aces against Tursunov to wrap up victory in just under two hours and put the United States in early control.  (REUTERS)

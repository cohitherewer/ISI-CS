 Anand blasts Fide rules
 Anand New Delhi: World champion Viswanathan Anand on Thursday ridiculed the championship rules that will require him to play former champion Vladimir Kramnik in a few months time to retain the title. The 37-year-old Indian GM, who won the championship last week in Mexico, said from Madrid that Fide formulated these complicated rules to win some votes during their election which was held last week and he hoped such a cycle would not be repeated in future. These are ridiculous rules. It was decided by Fide during their elections last year in order to win a few votes. I hope it is not repeated in future, Anand said. Under Fide rules, Anand will have to play Kramnik, the previous champion who finished second in the world championships, in a match-play format next year. Whoever emerges victorious will then play the winner of the match between former champion Veselin Topalov and the claimant of World Cup to be held in Russia later this year. Anand, who is expected to visit India later this month, was enjoying the honour being lavished on him in Spain, where he is based. It was really a nice reception in Spain. The mayor also called me up to congratulate, he said. The world No. 1, who next heads to Turkey to play some of the club matches, said he was still enjoying being the champion and was not thinking about the match against Kramnik. I am still enjoying the feeling. I will play a few club matches in Turkey now. I have not given a thought to the match against Kramnik. It is just a commitment, he said.  (PTI)

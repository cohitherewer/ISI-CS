 CRICKET BRIEFS 
 
	BCCI won rsquo;t help  
	 Kanpur: The BCCI and Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) on Monday refused to provide financial help to the family of former Ranji player Ram Babu Pal, who recently committed suicide. ldquo;The bank where Ram Babu used to work has to provide financial assistance to his family hellip; The BCCI won rsquo;t be able to do it, rdquo; vice president Rajiv Shukla said. 
	 UPCA director Jyoti Bajpai said the association wouldn rsquo;t be able to offer any help as there was no provision to provide financial assistance to the family of a player after his death. 
	 Tuffey may join ICL 
	 Christchurch: The Indian Cricket League (ICL) may rope in former New Zealand Test spearhead Darryl Tuffey, who said the offer is quite tempting. ldquo;I rsquo;m leaning towards (signing) hellip; It rsquo;s the money and a bit of security. Nothing rsquo;s guaranteed with New Zealand Cricket (NZC), even the money you get playing domestic cricket back home, rdquo; Tuffey was quoted as saying by a New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) report. ldquo;You rsquo;ve got to start looking after No.1 at some point, rdquo; he added. 
	 Session with psychologist 
	 Calcutta: Bengal cricketers are set for another mental toughness programme under Mumbai-based sports psychologist Dr Kinjal Suratwala. The squad on Monday returned from their tour of Hyderabad and Karanataka where they played four matches (three wins, one draw). Describing their practice stint as quite satisfactory, coach Bharat Arun said: ldquo;The boys did well in all departments hellip; There was total team effort. It helped us identify our positive and negative areas. It rsquo;s really satisfactory considering that few seniors have left (for ICL). rdquo; 
	 Mahela denial 
	 Colombo: As Sri Lankan authorities await the return of star batsman Maravan Atapattu into the side to take on the mighty Australians next month, captain Mahela Jayawardene has clarified that he never made any charges against the former captain.

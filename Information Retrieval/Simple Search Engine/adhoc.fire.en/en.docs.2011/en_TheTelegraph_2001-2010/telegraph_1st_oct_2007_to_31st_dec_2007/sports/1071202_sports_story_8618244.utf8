 CRICKET BRIEFS 
					 Lanka govt plans stamp in honour of Murali 						
	 Colombo: The Sri Lankan government will release a stamp in honour of Mutthiah Muralidharan after the spin legend breaks Shane Warne rsquo;s world record of highest number of Test wickets. Muralidharan, 35, needs five more wickets to achieve the feat and is expected to surpass the Australian rsquo;s mark of 708 wickets during the ongoing Test series against England in Kandy.						
	 ldquo;We have decided to release a stamp in honour of Muralidharan after he breaks the world record, rdquo; a top cricket official said. 						
	 A circular stamp is to be issued by the philatelic bureau of the department of posts of Sri Lanka. This will be the first time a circular stamp is issued in Sri Lankan history, a newspaper said. The stamp will be of a denomination of Rs 5 with a design of famous artist Pulasthi Ediriweera and a circular design denoting the cricket ball.						
	Pietersen loses cash						
	Colombo: England batsman Kevin Pietersen has reported losing 1,000 dollars in cash while the team was based at a plush hotel in the Sri Lankan capital, police said on Saturday. Pietersen, 27, had left the money in his hotel room in Colombo, police officer P.T. Sisira said.						
	 ldquo;The money was in his bag at the time it was reported missing, rdquo; Sisira said. ldquo;Investigations are going on and we have recorded statements from the hotel employees. rdquo;						
	 The dashing batsman, due to wed pop-star fianc eacute;e Jessica Taylor later this month, is currently touring Sri Lanka with the England team for a three-Test series.						Asif seeks third opinion 						
	 Karachi: Pakistan pacer Mohammed Asif could face a long time out of cricket if specialists in Australia recommend orthoscopy surgery for his elbow joints problem that has ruled him out of the ongoing tour of India.						
	 Asif leaves for Sydney on Sunday to consult specialist Paul Allot who will give his opinion on whether the pacer will require surgery for the problem that has troubled him since October. 						
	 Asif was ruled out of the one-day and Test series against India after failing to make a satisfactory recovery from the nagging injury.				 
	One doctor in Pakistan has already recommended surgery for him while another has said he can recover without it which is why he is going to Australia for a third opinion, rdquo; Dr Sohail Saleem, who is on the PCB medical panel, said.

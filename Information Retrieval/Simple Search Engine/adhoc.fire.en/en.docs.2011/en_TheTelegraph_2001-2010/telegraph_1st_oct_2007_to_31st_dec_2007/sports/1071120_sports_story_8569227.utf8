 Sourav, Deep back captain Shukla
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: The innings defeat to Baroda in their second Ranji match has sent shock waves through Bengal cricket. So much so that some are talking of a change in leadership. Former captains Sourav Ganguly and Deep Dasgupta, however, backed Laxmi Ratan Shukla on Monday saying the selectors should not act in a hurry. The CAB has sought an urgent report from the manager and the coach on the teams performance in Vadodara. Bengal slumped to an innings and 59-run defeat on Sunday. Its just the start of the season. One loss doesnt mean much They are proven performers and can still come back, said Sourav, who came home for a day. Asked if promoting Manoj Tiwary could be a solution, Sourav said: Too many leaders in one team doesnt help What happens if Manoj loses another match? Deep, under whose captaincy Bengal made the Ranji final in the last two seasons, said: Its unfair to comment based on the performance in just one game. It all boils down to what the coach and the team management are thinking Removing Shukla was no solution, Deep said. Performance wise,b it would unfair to remove Shukla Deep felt there was still hope for Bengal. Its not that we have lost everything Maybe we havent reached the same level as the last two years. But its still achievable, he said. The selectors, too, are undecided. Shukla is as good as his team What is the point of having another captain almost at the start of a season? said a selector. The selectors, however, are likely to effect a couple of changes. Iresh Saxena will come in if the injured Murtaza Lodhgar is still unfit. Arindam Ghosh may replace Safi Ahmed. Bengal next play Punjab in Siliguri from December 1.

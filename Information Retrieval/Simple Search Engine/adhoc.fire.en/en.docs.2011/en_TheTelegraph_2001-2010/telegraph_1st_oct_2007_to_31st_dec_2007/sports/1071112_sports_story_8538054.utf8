 Nadal, Ferrer start on winning note
Shanghai: Spains Rafael Nadal charged back from a set down to beat Frenchman Richard Gasquet 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the opening match of the ATP Masters Cup on Sunday. The French Open champion recovered from a sluggish start, winning his round robin opener in a shade over two hours in Shanghai. David Ferrer made it a perfect day for Spain with an impressive 6-4, 6-4 victory over Serbias Novak Djokovic in the second Gold Group match. In doubles, Leander Paes and Martin Damm made a winning start in the Gold Group. The Indo-Czech pair beat Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Belarussian Max Mirnyi 6-4, 6-1. The fourth-seeded pair, who had lost to Bjorkman and Mirnyi in the semi-finals here last year, overcame an indifferent form as they were coming on consecutive first round defeats in the Masters series tournaments in Paris and Madrid. Gasquet, who had lost all three of his previous matches against Nadal, took the first set after securing a break at 4-3 with a forehand rocket down the line. Nadal came to life in the second, the world No. 2 breaking Gasquet to love for a 4-2 lead and levelling the match with a fierce serve to his opponents body. Gasquet battled gamely to stem the tide but a pumped-up Nadal broke through at the same point in the decider and clinched victory with a textbook backhand volley. In another match, Israels Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram defeated Paul Hanley of Australia and Kevin Ullyet of Zimbabawe 6-7 (1), 6-3, 14-12.  (REUTERS)

 I hold none responsible, says Malik
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik is not ready to accept that most of his batsmen got out to poor shots. On Monday, after Pakistan lost to India by six wickets, Malik admitted that another 100 runs could have been enough to save the first Test but said every batsman has his own style of batting. Every batsman plays the game uniquely and succeeds in his own style, Malik said. You cant blame anyone for not playing the way you want him to. All these allegations start when the team loses. Things would be different if we can make a comeback in Calcutta. The Pakistan captain, who failed with the bat in both innings, refused to accept the suggestion that Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf should have batted in a more responsible manner. I hold no one responsible for the defeat, Malik said. Yousuf and Younis bhai are great batsmen. They have nothing to prove. I am confident that they will do well in the next two Tests. Overall, we didnt bat well in this match. The skipper admitted that Shoaib Akhtars form in the second innings was very encouraging. He is in great form. It is very encouraging. I am sure he will be too hot to handle in the next two Tests. Throughout the first match of the three-Test series, Pakistan were accused of lacking aggression. Malik laughed it off. The only thing missing was 400 runs on the board.

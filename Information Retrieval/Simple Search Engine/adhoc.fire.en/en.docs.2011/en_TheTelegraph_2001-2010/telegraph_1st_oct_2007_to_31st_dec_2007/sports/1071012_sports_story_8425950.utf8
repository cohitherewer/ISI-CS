 Ghei, Mann among Day I leaders
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Gaurav Ghei in action on Thursday. (AFP) New Delhi: Gaurav Ghei has learned to deal with the injuries which has threatened his career over the years. After spending several frustrating years on the sidelines because of injuries, he came back with a bang last year with a win in the Taiwan Masters. On the opening day of the $500,000 Hero Honda Indian Open on Thursday, things were no different. Ghei displayed his skills at the Delhi Golf Club Course here despite having a stiff neck. To add to his woes, the star golfer was fined by a vigilant traffic cop on way to the course in the morning! Yet Ghei came up with a solid performance to have a bogey free opening round of six-under 66 and join five others  Gurbazz Mann, Koreas Hur In-hoi, Australian David Gleeson, Thailands Chapchai Nirat and Malaysia Danny Chia in the lead. Lying just behind are Chinese Taipeis Lu Wen-the, who has already won two titles this season, S.S.P. Chowrasia, Shamim Khan, Ashok Kumar, amateur Jasjeet Singh, Martin Rominger and Chang Tse-peng. Calcutta based Chowrasia, who was edged out by Randhawa in a thrilling finish last year, wasnt too happy with his own performance. My chip-and-putt was okay but I missed a four-foot putt and thats simply not done, he said. Ghei, on his part, was happy with his performance despite the stiff neck. When I got up in the morning, I seriously thought that I would need treatment, Ghei added. But before I knew it, I was getting fined for not having a pollution certificate in my car at 6.30am! This set me back by 20 minutes and I just ran into the club and went to the range to hit a few balls. I wasnt feeling great when I got to the tee. But I putted extraordinarily and that helped. Starting from the 10th, Ghei birdied the 12th and 14th holes to turn in 34 before nailing an eagle on the first hole after he rifled a three iron approach to 12 feet from the flag. He finished his round in style with birdies over his closing two holes. Jeev Milkha Singh, playing in India for the first time in five years, hogged the limelight but had a rather lean day. He battled to a 72 with two bogeys over his last three holes spoiling his return. I missed a lot of birdies as my putts fell short, Jeev said later. Defending champion Jyoti Randhawa had a shaky start as he sank three birdies against a bogey. I didnt give myself too many opportunities but I felt I left a few shots out on the course, said Randhawa. After spending most of the time in Europe this year, I am taking some time to adjust to the greens here, he said. Thailand s Thaworn Wiratchant, considered a dreaded player in the Asian circuit, had a poor day, going three-over 75.

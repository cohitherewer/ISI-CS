 Im a proud man, says Brett Lee

 - Its something for the doubters: Clark 
Brett Lee and Stuart Clark, both of whom returned four-wicket hauls in Indias first innings, spoke to the media after stumps on Thursday. 
The following are excerpts 
LEE: It was a fantastic day and joining the 250 Test wickets club was a special moment... Im a proud man... The wicket is very slow and low and, so, patience was called for... Mitchell Johnson bowled superbly, but was unlucky not to get wickets... Brad Hogg also bowled very well... He was like a dog off a leash and any team would love to have him... Personally, it feels great to be on a high (at the end of the year)...It had, after all, been very painful mentally and physically to miss the World Cup (in March-April) through injury... 
CLARK: The nature of the wicket didnt change from the first day... If it was a bad ball, it got hit... As the ball got scuffed, we got quite a bit of reverse swing... Its nice that I got four wickets, its something for the doubters who werent sure I deserved to be in the XI.. Sachin Tendulkar was batting beautifully till I got him... Sourav Ganguly fell to a perfect flipper from Hogg...

Hed just returned to the team hotel after a scan. Cricket manager Lalchand Rajput said much the same thing. Its not a tear, but Sourav has to rest One cant take a chance. Sourav, it may be recalled, went off the field in the 27th over of the first ODI against the world champions, here on Saturday. The squad has only been picked for the first three matches and the selectors are likely to rest the Big Three  Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav and Rahul Dravid  by rotation.

 Pete makes Roger toil
 Pete Sampras and Roger Federer, wearing traditional South Korean outfits, in Seoul on Tuesday. (AP) Seoul: In an exhibition match between the giants of tennis present and past, world No.1 Roger Federer defeated Pete Sampras in straight sets 6-4, 6-3, though the match was more competitive than the scoreline suggests. The match in Seoul is the first of three Asian exhibitions the legends will play. The pair meet again Thursday in Kuala Lumpur before heading to Macau two days later. Sampras, 36, retired in 2002, a year after the only previous meeting between the pair in Wimbledon 2001. Federer won that fourth round match in five sets. If the Swiss star  who lifted his fourth Masters Cup title Sunday in Shanghai  expected an easier ride against the ageing American, he was in for a shock. Sampras won cheers from the crowd in Seouls Olympic Tennis Arena as he fired down two fierce aces in his first service game. The balding Sampras proceeded to break his opponents serve and then moved 4-2 ahead courtesy of a delightful drop shot. I feel pretty good, Sampras told Korean Television after the game. I made it competitive, which was my goal. Obviously Roger is the best player in the world and I retired five years ago. I am grateful that he invited me. Federer was equally happy. Pete was one of my idols growing up and its great to play him, Federer said. It wasnt easy for me, it wasnt easy for him as hes been retired five years. I am number one and everyone expects me to win. All the familiar trademark volleys and serves were on display but Sampras, who has won 14 Grand Slams to Federers 12, was slower around the court than in his 1990s heyday and made a number of unforced errors. Federer took advantage of those to break Samprass serve and take the first set 6-4.  (AP)

 Smith wary of Kaneria
 South Africa captain Graeme Smith and his Pakistan counterpart Shoaib Malik with the Test series trophy in Karachi on Sunday. (AFP) Karachi: South African skipper Graeme Smith believes putting runs on the board early will be key for his side in a Test series against Pakistan starting Monday. Smith and Herschelle Gibbs are set to resume their opening partnership in the first Test at the National stadium. South Africa have tried out six different opening combinations in their last 12 Tests. Playing in the subcontinent is always a big challenge and there is pressure. But I am pretty comfortable we can respond to it accordingly and do a good job, Smith told a news conference on Sunday. The key to doing well on these pitches in the subcontinent is to post enough runs on the board. There is a key role for our top three batsmen in this series. Pakistan have prepared a slow turning track for the opening Test and are expected to play two specialist spinners  Danish Kaneria and Abdul Rehman, who will make his Test debut. Danish is going to be a big challenge for us on this dry pitch, said Smith. But this is the sort of pitch we were pretty much expecting so we are not surprised. The challenge is to adapt ourselves accordingly and remain patient. The South African captain said he was pleased with the form of the only spinner in the touring side, Paul Harris, but admitted the foot injury to Morne Morkel was a worry. Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik defended the choice of a dry, slow pitch, saying home conditions were the only advantage Pakistan had. South Africa has depth and experienced batters and six pace bowlers and one spinner in their side. So obviously we have to play to our strength, he said. But I think this pitch is good for batsmen and bowlers provided you put in that extra effort.

 Uefa fixing fears under probe
Lucerne (Switzerland): Uefa has given police a list of 15 matches it suspects may have been fixed, a senior Uefa source said on Saturday. News of the match-fixing investigation came as Uefa officials and coaches gathered in Lucerne ahead of Sundays draw for Euro 2008, to be played in Switzerland and Austria. According to a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 15 matches are under investigation and being dealt with by Uefas disciplinary committee. The matches under suspicion were played in a variety of Uefa competitions including a Euro 2008 qualifier, Champions League qualifiers, Uefa Cup qualifiers and Uefa Cup and Intertoto Cup ties. Uefa would not confirm when the matches took place although a 96-page dossier handed to Interpol last month goes back to July 2005. Irregular betting patterns on the matches alerted Uefa to the possibility that some may have been fixed. (Reuters)

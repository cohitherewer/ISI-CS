 Ferguson likely to alter Sahas role
IAN WHITTELL Alex Ferguson The precarious nature of this seasons title race, not to mention the questionable nature of Wayne Rooneys durability, were underlined on Friday when the England centre-forward was ruled out of the Manchester United and England teams for at least one month. News of Rooneys injury came, ironically, within short hours of manager Sir Alex Ferguson declaring he had his strongest squad of the season available for Sundays meeting with Blackburn Rovers, a sobering thought for rivals who have seen United win 12 and draw one of their last 13 league and Champions League games. Even more tellingly, the announcement came in the wake of Ferguson outlining that he views the injury-prone 12.8 million French striker Louis Saha as an impact substitute rather than a starter. Saha, 29, has hardly earned a reputation for durability since arriving from Fulham, having been injured for most of the past 12 months, having failed to start a league game this season and having made just 37 starts in the three seasons before this. Were trying to manage Louiss situation, Ferguson said, before news of Rooneys injury emerged. We know we dont play him every game, so the dilemma is do we start him or do we bring him on? If we look at the composition of our side now, hes different to everyone else. I think he makes a bigger impact as a substitute. He makes a great impact. Therefore at the moment my inclination is to use him as a substitute. Hes fine with that. I think were managing the situation in the right way. Whether Ferguson now alters that analysis, deciding to partner Saha with Carlos Tevez from kick-off against Mark Hughes in-form Blackburn, remains to be seen. He could opt to use Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo or even Anderson in a supporting role to Tevez. Rooneys injury will also fuel speculation that Ferguson will reignite his interest in Boltons Nicolas Anelka. Blackburn will make the trip to Manchester without Robbie Savage (knee) but South African defender Aaron Mokoena (shin) could feature in the match. Manchester United, meanwhile, have beaten Liverpool and Chelsea to sign Burnley teenager John Cofie. The 14-year-old, who is of Ghanaian descent but has represented England at schoolboy level, has joined on a six-year contract for an undisclosed fee, understood to be in the region of 500,000. Liverpool had been favourites to sign the striker after inviting him as a guest to their recent Carling Cup tie against Cardiff City at Anfield. Burnley will receive a 25 per cent sell-on clause and first option on loaning Cofie back, and United have also agreed to play the Championship side in a friendly. Burnley director Brendan Flood said: The player was unwilling to come back to Burnley, so we didnt have a choice.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

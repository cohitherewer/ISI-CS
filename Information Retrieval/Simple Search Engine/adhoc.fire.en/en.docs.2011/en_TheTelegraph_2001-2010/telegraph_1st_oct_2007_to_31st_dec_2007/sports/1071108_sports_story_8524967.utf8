 We dont fear Australia: Jayawardene
A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene has remained confident saying they are not scared of Australia going into the first Test in Brisbane, despite poor batting in the warm-up against Queensland, according to www.cricinfo.com. We dont fear Australia. Weve improved as a group over the past two years, especially away from home, Jayawardene said on Wednesday, the eve of the Test. Ponting, however, has a different opinion and believes his opponents carry the same fear that forced them to rest key players when they faced Australia in the Super Eights at the World Cup. Its the same group and weve got a very good record against them, Ponting said. We had a great Test series against them in my first series as captain (in 2004). All those fears are definitely still there. We want to start this series well and reinvigorate some of those fears that are still in them. Sri Lanka have won only one Test against Australia, in Kandy in 1999, and Jayawardene hopes his senior pros  Sanath Jayasuriya, Maravan Atapattu, Muttiah Muralidharan and Chaminda Vaas  will be in top form if they are to add a second. In absence of Kumar Sangakkara, who is out with an injury, Prasanna Jayawardene will play at No. 7.

 Brett Lee sets up 14th straight Test win
 The Australian team with the Warne-Muralidharan Trophy in Hobart on Tuesday. (AP) Hobart: Australia beat Sri Lanka by 96 runs on Tuesday to win the second Test at Bellerive Oval and complete a 2-0 series sweep. The Australians wrapped up victory in the third over after lunch on the fifth and final day when Sri Lanka were dismissed for 410 despite a defiant 192 from Kumar Sangakkara, the highest score by a Sri Lankan in a Test against Australia. The tourists resumed on 247 for three, needing a further 260 runs to reach an unlikely victory target of 507, but lost six wickets in the extended morning session then their last batsmen 12 minutes after the restart. Australian fast bowler Brett Lee, who was named Man of the Match in both Tests, captured four for 87 to finish with 16 wickets for the series. The victory was Australias 14th consecutive Test triumph, leaving them two short of the world record they set between 1999 and 2001, with a chance of setting a new mark in the upcoming home series against India starting on December 26. The end results probably say that this series has been easy win for us but theres a lot of hard work that goes into winning any Test match, Australia captain Ricky Ponting told a news conference. We played well in the first Test in Brisbane and we carried a fair bit of that over into this game in Hobart. Once again, I thought our batting on Day I and most of Day II was absolutely outstanding and set the game up early and Brett led the way again with the ball. Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene conceded his side had been outplayed by a better team but could not hide his disappointment at losing the series 0-2. I felt we had a very good team, a good attack but the way we played wasnt very consistent, Jayawardene said. We couldnt penetrate that top-order, which was very disappointing. And the way we batted was disappointing as well  particularly the first innings we played in both Test matches. (Reuters)

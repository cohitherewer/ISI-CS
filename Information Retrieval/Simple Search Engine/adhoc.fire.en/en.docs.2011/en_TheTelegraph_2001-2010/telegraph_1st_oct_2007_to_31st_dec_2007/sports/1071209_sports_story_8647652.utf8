 Yuvraj should be a regular in Test XI

 - Sourav salutes fellow southpaw 
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL
 Sourav Ganguly en route to his unbeaten 125 in Bangalore on Saturday 
Bangalore: Back in his room at the Grand Ashok, Sourav Ganguly checked his cellphones for messages and, then, ordered his favourite Darjeeling chai. That done, the former Team India captain parked himself on the sofa and began surfing news channels. 
Clips of his and Yuvraj Singhs hundred-reaching boundaries made Sourav smile. Yeah, we did well in conditions which, early on, were tough, he told The Telegraph. 
The first to call and congratulate Sourav for hundreds in back-to-back Tests was Bengal minister Asok Bhattacharya. Wife Dona followed, but Sourav was waiting for daughter Sanas call. At this time (5.45pm), shes busy with friends! Ive got no choice but to wait... 
While doing so, Sourav spoke exclusively to this newspaper. 
The following are excerpts: 
On hundreds in back-to-back Tests for the first time since his debut series (England, 1996) 
(After a pause) I was under the impression Id got back-to-back hundreds versus Sri Lanka in 1997-98 as well... Feels good, definitely... Given the position we were in (61 for four), it was important to build an innings and make the decision to bat count. 
On whether scores of 102 and 46 in the last Test (at the Eden) boosted his confidence 
A hundred does lift confidence, but Ive consistently done well since my comeback at the Wanderers last December... I think Ive delivered whenever the team needed a contribution. 
On his unbeaten 125 
Because of the conditions, its one of the better ones... As the wicket here is different from the Eden, I suppose this hundred has been technically better... The Eden one will, of course, be very special  but for different reasons (first in his hometown)... This is going to be special as, at one stage, we were four down for next to nothing. That too in a Test with the series still undecided. 
On appearing to treat Saturday as just another day in office 
(Laughs) I dont have to get carried away, do I? 
On the odd occasion that he took a walk to psyche himself 
Did it when I felt I was beginning to play loosely... If the ball is doing something, then youve got to fight it out in that period... Its about having resolve and showing character. 
On having slowed down after getting into the 80s 
I knew I was nearing a hundred, but didnt have to rush there... After all, its a Test match. 
On whether hed like to dedicate his 15th Test hundred to somebody 
Not really. 
On plans for Day II 
Our first aim is to see off the second new ball, which isnt many overs old... Dinesh Karthik (the other overnighter) can bat as also Irfan Pathan and Anil Kumble, so we should get the maximum on the board. 
On Kumbles decision to bat 
With two spinners in the XI, we needed to have first use of the wicket. Absolutely no debate there. 
On the virgin wicket 
There was grass and it had moisture... We expected that because of the rain in the days leading up to the Test... Early on, the ball was doing quite a bit and, so, one had to stay focused. One has to be prepared for life in the opening session of a Test. 
On Yuvraj Singhs hundred 
Fantastic... He wasnt getting opportunities and, when he did, made the most... Its not for me to comment on matters of selection, but I do feel Yuvraj should be a regular in the Test XI. 
On his first 300 partnership in Test cricket (Sourav and Rahul Dravid, by the way, added 318 for the second wicket, against Sri Lanka at Taunton, in the 1999 World Cup) 
(Grins) Wasnt aware its a first... We enjoyed batting together and the good thing is that we scored very quickly... Indeed, when Yuvraj gets runs, its at a fast clip... We were positive and that made a difference, allowing the initiative to be taken away from Pakistan. 
On the time when the powers-that-be and a section of the media made it out as a Sourav versus Yuvraj fight for a Team India berth 
I suppose thats because both of us are left-handers! Honestly, cant think of any other reason. 
On Shoaib Akhtars gamesmanship before heading to hospital for an MRI scan 
He tried to be different and I backed off... Jason Gillespie would do something similar... 
On whether the hundreds on successive Saturdays have come as the perfect build-up for the Test series in Australia 
Well, that will be an entirely fresh series and in very different conditions. 
Finally, on emerging the frontrunner for the MoS award 
Havent thought about it... That cant be a goal, because cricket isnt played by setting such goals. But, yes, Im going to be happy if I get the award.

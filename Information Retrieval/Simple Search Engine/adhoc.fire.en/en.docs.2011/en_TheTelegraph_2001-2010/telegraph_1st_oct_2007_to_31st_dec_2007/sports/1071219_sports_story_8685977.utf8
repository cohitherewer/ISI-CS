 IFA mulls rotation policy 

A STAFF REPORTER
Calcutta: The IFA is planning to send a proposal to the AIFF to allow top players to play both local tour naments and the I-League through a rotation policy. 
IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly, after attending a league sub-committee meeting on Tuesday, said: We agree with the AIFF in principle that the I-League should have top priority. But we also need measures to ensure that the absence of key players, who are on national duty, do not take the sheen off the local league. 
To avoid such a situation, we may have a rotation policy in place through which the Bhaichung Bhutias can skip some I-League matches to play in local tournaments, he added. 
Ganguly will discuss these proposals with the citys top three clubs on Wednesday. It has been learnt that once he gets a green signal from them, the proposals will be forwarded to the AIFF. 
Meanwhile, Mohammedan Sporting won the Bodoland Martys Gold Cup after beating Chirag United 1-0 in the final in Korajhar, Assam, on Tuesday. Muritala scored the winner.

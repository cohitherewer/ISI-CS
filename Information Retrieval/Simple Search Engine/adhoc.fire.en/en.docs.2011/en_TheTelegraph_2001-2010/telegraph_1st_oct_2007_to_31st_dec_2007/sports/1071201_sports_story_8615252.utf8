 EBs turn to get JCT shock 
A STAFF REPORTER JCT players (from left to right) MoM Eduardo da Silva, captain Julius Akpele and Sunil Chhetri after their 3-1 win over East Bengal in their I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: East Bengal followed Mohun Bagans suit, going down 1-3 to JCT in the ONGC I-League at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Eduardo da Silva scored a hattrick (43rd, 68th and 83rd) for the Phagwara side while Edmilson pulled one back for East Bengal through conversion of a 50th-minute penalty. Edu, as he is affectionately called, also scored the brace in 2-1 win over Mohun Bagan on Monday. East Bengal didnt play as bad as one might believe seeing the scoreline, but the opponents enjoyed clear edge over them in finishing. Apart from Majek Bolaji, nobody in the East Bengal backline was able to withstand the waves of attacks from the likes of Eduardo and Sunil Chhetri. Chhetri, who also didnt score against Mohun Bagan, took up a different role on Friday, just to avoid his marker. Chhetris run down the touchline and sailing the ball into the East Bengal box was a strategy, East Bengal appeared clueless to counter. JCT drew the first blood in the 43rd minute. Marcoss free-kick from outside the box was headed home by Eduardo, after Chettris dummy jump. East Bengal restored parity in the 50th minute. Edmilson was brought down by Jaspal Singh inside the box and the referee Benjamin Silva pointed towards the spot. The Brazilian made no mistake in beating Karanjit Singh. Just when everyone was expecting East Bengal to take the JCT box under siege, Eduardo poured cold water on the home teams enthusiasm by scoring his second goal of the match. Eduardo, this time, headed home from an perfectly weighted Marcos corner. Eduardo then sealed the match seven minutes from time. Chettris cross from the right landed near Eduardo and the latter dodged past Madhab Das to place the ball to the left of Abhra Mondal. East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya later blamed his defence for the loss. We have so many players on the injury list that it has become difficult for us to field a strong team, Bhattacharya said. TEAMS JCT: Karanjit Singh, Jaspal Singh, Anwar, Julius Akpele, Baldeep Singh, Daljit Singh, Marcos, Gurwinder Singh, Baljit Sahni (Jaswinder Singh 59), Sunil Chhetri, Eduardo da Silva (Praveen Kumar 84). East Bengal: Abhra Mondal, Debabrata Roy, Majek Bolaji, Madhab Das, Syed Rahim Nabi, Mehtab Hussain (Mehrajuddin Wadoo 71), Jayanta Sen, Dipankar Roy, Alvito DCunha, Ashim Biswas (McDonald Mukansi 53), Marques Edmilson. Referee: Benjamin Silva.

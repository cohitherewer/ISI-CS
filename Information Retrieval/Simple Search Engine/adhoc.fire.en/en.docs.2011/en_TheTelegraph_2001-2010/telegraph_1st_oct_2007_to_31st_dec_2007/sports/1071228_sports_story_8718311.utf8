 CRICKET BRIEFS

 
	Shoaib in fresh trouble
 
	Karachi: The PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf has hinted that pacer Shoaib Akhtar could face disciplinary action when the governing body of the board meets to review the performance of the Pakistan team on their tour of India.

 The meeting will be held next month in Karachi. ldquo;We are not happy with the antics and efforts of Shoaib at times during the tour, particularly in the final Test in Bangalore and this will be discussed by the governing body, rdquo; Ashraf said. ldquo;It would be premature to comment on what the governing body might decide but it is authorised to recommend any disciplinary action against any player or official if it feels he has not shown enough commitment to the national team. rdquo;
 
	PCB rsquo;s no mercy
 
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Nasim Ashraf has ruled out the possibility of giving a general amnesty to players who were banned for participating in the Indian Cricket League (ICL).

 ldquo;Well it is something that can be discussed by our governing body members and they have the authority to take a decision on this. But I must emphasise that the players knew what they were doing and the consequences of playing in the ICL when they signed their contracts, rdquo; he said when asked whether the players would be pardoned.

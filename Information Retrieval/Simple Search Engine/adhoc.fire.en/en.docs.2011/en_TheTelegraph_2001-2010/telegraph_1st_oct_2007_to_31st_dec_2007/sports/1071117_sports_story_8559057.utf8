 England look for a miracle
Milan: Scotland will qualify for Euro 2008 with a home win over Italy on Saturday, a result which would leave the world champions in real danger of missing out when group matches come to a close next week. A victory for Italy, though, would shatter Scottish hopes of reaching the finals in Austria and Switzerland and send fellow-World Cup finalists France through as well. The group B showdown in Glasgow is one of a number of matches this weekend that could decide qualification. England are at risk of missing a major championship for the first time since the 1994 World Cup and are desperately hoping Israel do them a favour by beating Russia at home. Steve McClarens men would then have to avoid defeat by group E leaders Croatia on Wednesday to edge out the Russians, irrespective of their result in Andorra. As Ive said all week, the campaign is not over and I still believe Wednesday will be the crunch game, said an optimistic McClaren. Various other permutations are possible in Group E and fans of countries in other groups will also be whipping out their calculators on Saturday. The Netherlands will qualify from group G with victory over Luxembourg but their passage could be assured earlier on Saturday if Bulgaria fail to win at home against already-qualified group leaders Romania. Group F leaders Sweden visit second-placed Spain with both sides knowing a defeat could give Denmark or Northern Ireland an outside chance of qualifying depending on who wins their battle in Belfast. Another virtual shootout takes place in Group C where Norway in second need a win at home to third-placed Turkey to go through and knock out their opponents. An away victory, though, would make Turkey favourites to join holders Greece in the finals. (Reuters)

 Jeev off to poor start
Kochi: An off-colour Jeev Milkha Singh had a nightmarish start to his title defence with the Indian pro stuttering to an opening round of three-over 75 for a tied 43rd place in the Casio World Open here on Thursday. Compatriot Shiv Kapur did slightly better to card a two-over 74 and join 15 others at 27th place after the first round. A 10th tee starter, Jeev had just two birdies to show against a treble of bogeys besides the double bogey on the par-four third hole, where he four-putted to hole the ball. Kapur, also playing his back nine first, went two-over 74 after a round during which he bogeyed the 15th, 17th and ninth holes and managed to sink in his lone birdie on the seventh at the Kochi Kuroshio Country Club. The quartet of Tateo Jet Ozaki, Toru Taniguchi, Taichi Teshima and I. J. Chang turned in identical rounds of three-under 69 to share the top slot. (PTI)

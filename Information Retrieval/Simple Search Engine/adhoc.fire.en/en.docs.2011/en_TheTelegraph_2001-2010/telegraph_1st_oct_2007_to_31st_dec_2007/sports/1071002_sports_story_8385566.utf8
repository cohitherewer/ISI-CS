 History beckons Hamiltons
Kevin Garside Lewis Hamilton Anthony Hamilton is in rare company. Only eight British fathers have sired a Formula One world champion. None has roared a rookie home. Having watched his son take a huge stride towards racing deification with a display that evoked the riches of Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher in the wet, Hamilton Sr reached for the hyperbole. I think its great not just for us, but for everybody: the UK, the world. Though 40 million Spaniards and a few million Finns might disagree, we can forgive Anthony his champagne moment. He was after all alluding to his sons broad appeal. Some thought him over-egging the pud, yet in one important sense he was addressing a constituency previously denied representation in Formula One. Race is a dirty word at McLaren. The concept dare not raise its awkward head in polite paddock conversation. But no matter how deep craniums are buried, a Hamilton world championship victory would be significant, for it lays to rest Formula Ones great, unwanted stereotype. Hamilton was born neither white, nor middle class. British rail clerks have tended not to produce progeny who grow to influence events in Monaco and Monza. Hamilton, the grandson of a Caribbean manual worker, is on the verge of resetting the parameters of Grand Prix racing. A win in China is the key to myriad doors. And not just for Hamilton. A raft of youngsters from ethnic minorities as well as the more traditional working class strongholds will be tuning in next Sunday to will British sports new hero home. You never know, some might even fancy a crack themselves one day. Hamilton is proof that anything is possible, however unlikely. He has unleashed the power of dreams. Until then, dad is fighting nobly to keep a lid on the excitement. Although weve won today, I still feel the same now as I did before the race, Anthony said. Youve got to wait until youve brought it home. Then its all different. Just go back to the hotel and have a meal and an early night. You start celebrating now and you could end up with egg on your face. Hamilton Sr revealed how a heart-to-heart after the Italian and Belgian GPs helped focus his sons mind. We talked. He went to the factory and looked at all the data to find out where he had been going wrong. He came here feeling confident. He got up this morning and wasnt nervous about the rain. He just said, Thats great. Hes been happy all weekend  back to the way he was in the US. Im sure everybody at home must have been jumping up and down, on the edge of their seats like we were because you never know whats going to happen in this weather. Hell be buzzing now but when he gets up hell be back to normal. Whatever he does to switch off, it works. I cant believe it myself how calm he is. No tension. The Hamiltons now head to Shanghai to regroup ahead of Sundays penultimate race of the season. Hamilton does not have to win, a minimum of four points (fifth) will see off Kimi Raikkonen and any finish higher than that and within a point of Fernando Alonso would bring to a successful end the most incredible opening chapter in F1 history.

 Title for Md. Sp. 
A STAFF REPORTER Win a boost for us, says Shabbir Ali Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting could not have asked for more. Shabbir Alis men on Thursday tasted their maiden success of the season  Independence Cup in Nagaon, after beating Border Security Force (BSF) 3-2 in tie-breaker. Their triumph came close on the heels of beating East Bengal 2-1 in the Sahara CFL Premier Division return leg derby. And as expected, it was Mike Okoro, who turned out to be Mohammedan Sportings hero. The city club was caught napping in the first-half by a marauding BSF side. But the Calcutta side did not take much time to read their mind and unleash an attacking game. But only they could do was to create two chances  by K. Kulothungan and Okoro  in the first-half. While Kulothungan failed to capitalise, Okoros long shot went over the goalpost. BSF converted two of their chances, while Mohammedan Sporting was one better with Okoro, Adewusi Adebayo and V. Prem Kumar settling the issue. Its really inspirational, especially when the win comes after having beaten East Bengal, the winning captain Farooq Mir Hyder told The Telegraph from the team hotel in Nagaon. The coach was equally ecstatic. Mike and Nasim did the difference. This will definitely help us boost our morale ahead of the NFL, said Ali.

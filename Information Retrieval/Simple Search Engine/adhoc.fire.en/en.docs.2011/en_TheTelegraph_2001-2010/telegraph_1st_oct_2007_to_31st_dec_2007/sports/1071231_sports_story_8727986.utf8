 Liverpool held by City

London: Liverpool missed the chance to close in on Premier League leader Arsenal after their 0-0 draw at Manchester City Sunday. 
Liverpool, who won the most recent of their record 18 league titles back in 1990, dominated possession and chances at City of Manchester Stadium, but were unable to break down a defence anchored by Richard Dunne and Micah Richards. 
Liverpool almost scored through Dirk Kuyt with moments remaining but had to settle for a point that left them on 37 points, 10 fewer than Arsenal and eight behind Manchester United. 
West Ham beat United 2-1 Saturday to stop the Red Devils moving further ahead and instead let Arsenal move into first place with a 4-1 win at Everton. 
That gave Liverpool hope of re-igniting their challenge for the title, but it was unable to take full advantage. 
At the other end of the standings, Derby stayed firmly at the bottom when they lost 1-2 to visiting Blackburn in Sundays other match. 
The Rams, who have won just once since getting promoted to the Premier League by winning last seasons playoffs, led in the 27th at Pride Park when Matt Oakley hit a shot from Tyrone Mearss cross under goalkeeper Brad Friedel. 
Steve Howard missed a chance to make it 2-0 in the 36th when Friedel saved his penalty kick and Roque Santa Cruz, who had already had a goal ruled out because of a foul, equalised in the 39th with his eighth goal in five games. 
Blackburn led three minutes later when winger David Bentley hit a 25-metre (yard) shot. (AP)

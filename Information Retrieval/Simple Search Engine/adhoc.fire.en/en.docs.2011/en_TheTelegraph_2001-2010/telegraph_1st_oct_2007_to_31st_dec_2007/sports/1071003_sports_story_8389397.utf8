 Aussies romp to 84-run win
 Brad Haddin hits one en route to his unbeaten 87 in Kochi on Tuesday. (AP) Kochi: Andrew Symonds and Brad Haddin powered to 87 runs apiece to set up Australias convincing 84-run win over India in the second one-dayer on Tuesday and avenge last months ICC World Twenty20 semi-final defeat. Australia, playing their first full one-dayer following their long break after claiming a World Cup hattrick in April, overcame early trouble to amass 306 for six on being asked to bat first. India, on a high since winning the Twenty20 title, were all out for 222, conceding a 1-0 lead in the seven-match series which began with a rain-abandoned fixture in Bangalore. Symonds shared 108 runs for the fifth wicket with Haddin, who was unbeaten after his second successive fifty, after adding 94 runs with opener Matthew Hayden (75) for the fourth wicket to rescue the innings from two for eight runs in the fourth over. Haddin was named Man of the Match. Fast bowler Stuart Clark removed Sachin Tendulkar (16) in his first over and trapped the aggressive Robin Uthappa (41) in reply to reduce India to 87 for four and snuff out the chase. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni top-scored with a slow 58 before being the last man out as injury-hit Australia stamped their class on the match. India frittered away advantage in both batting and bowling. Tendulkar and Uthappa took 18 runs off one over from Brett Lee but Clark took the pace off the ball to great effect with the fight ending once Rahul Dravid (31), who added 49 runs with Dhoni, was caught in the deep. The third ODI will be played in Hyderabad on Friday.  (AGENCIES)

 ICC to discuss Symonds issue
Melbourne: The ICC has taken a stern view of incidents of alleged racist crowd behaviour in India and the head of the sports world governing body vowed to take concrete action. We have a board meeting next week and we will discuss matters there. We will definitely take action on anything we receive arising from the matches in India. We will look at the report provided to us by our Match Referee and our officials on the ground, and from there we will decide what is the best course of action to take, president Ray Maliwas quoted as saying in a daily. Malis statements followed Wednesdays seventh one-day International between India and Australia in Mumbai, which saw alleged racist taunts by a section of the crowd. Symonds had alleged similar gestures during the match in Vadodara too. Match Referee Chris Broad confirmed he had included details in his report after the match at the Wankhede. I would reiterate that racism should have no part in sport, Broad said. The report is now in the hands of the ICC. CA chief executive James Sutherland said he was happy with the way the BCCI has reacted to the issue and there was no question of boycotting the future tours of India. I dont think it has got to that stage or even gets to that stage (of boycotting), Sutherland was quoted as saying. There is an ICC anti-racism policy in place. The ICC and the BCCI, the host of these matches, will no doubt deal with these issues going forward. It is really pleasing to see overnight the announcements by the BCCI president to condemn racism in cricket, he said. (Agencies)

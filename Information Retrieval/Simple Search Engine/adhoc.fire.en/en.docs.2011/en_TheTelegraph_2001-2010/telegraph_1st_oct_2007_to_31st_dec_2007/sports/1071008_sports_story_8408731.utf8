 IOC in a spot over Marion gold
SIMON HART Katerina Thanau The International Olympic Committee is to explore its legal options in an attempt to avoid the humiliation of having to hand over an Olympic gold medal to the disgraced Greek sprinter, Katerina Thanou, in the wake Marion Joness dramatic confession that she took an illegal steroid before the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Jones, who won three gold and two bronzes medals in Sydney, pleaded guilty in a New York district court on Friday to lying to federal investigators when she originally told them she had never used performance-enhancing drugs. In court, Jones read out a statement confirming that before the start of the Sydney Games she had taken THG, the designer steroid at the heart of the Balco doping conspiracy. Her admission, which had been given advance publicity in the form of a letter to friends and family that had found its way into the Washington Post newspaper, means the American will inevitably be stripped of her Sydney medals since it falls within the IOCs eight-year statute of limitations for drug offences. Normally, those athletes who finished behind her in Sydney would expect to be elevated one place on the podium, but the nightmare facing the IOC is that the runner-up behind Jones in the 100m was Thanou, who was responsible for one of the biggest doping scandals in Olympic history at the Athens Games four years later. However, it is understood that the IOC is already taking legal advice about the options open to them after Jones loses her medals and it is by no means certain that the Greek will be promoted. You shouldnt take it for granted that its an automatic thing that Marion Jones gives her medal back and everyone else moves up, said an insider. Despite their reluctance to reward a convicted dope cheat, it is hard to see how they can avoid it because Thanou was not guilty of any doping offence in 2000 and would therefore argue that she was fully entitled to receive the 100m gold.  Marion Jones If the IOC fail to find a legal loophole, they will be in the invidious position of having to hand a medal to the woman who, along with fellow Greek athlete Kostas Kenteris, tarnished the Athens Olympics by missing a drugs test the night before the opening ceremony and then allegedly faking a motorbike accident. The pair were eventually forced to withdraw from the Games and later served two-year bans for missing three dope tests. They both still face a perjury trial in Greece for allegedly giving false statements about the crash and encouraging medical staff at an Athens hospital to issue false certificates. Dick Pound, the president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), admitted that rewarding the Greek would be a regrettable by-product of Joness confession. Thats one of the disagreeable aspects, said Pound. That will be hard to swallow.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

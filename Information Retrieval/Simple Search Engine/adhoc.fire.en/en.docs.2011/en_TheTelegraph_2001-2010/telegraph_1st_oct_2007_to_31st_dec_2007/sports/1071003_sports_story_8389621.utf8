 Alonso cant wait to leave Lewis 
Timothy Collings Fernando Alonso Fernando Alonso made it clear on Monday that he would be delighted to leave Lewis Hamilton and McLaren behind to return to Renault, or join any other competitive team, at the end of this year. The drivers champion, whose defence of his world crown was wrecked almost beyond repair when he crashed out of Sundays rain-lashed Japanese Grand Prix won by Hamilton, told the Spanish radio station, SER, that if he had to stay for the second year of his contract it would signal another season of acrimony and discord. The 26-year-old Spaniard also denied he was lining up a drive at Ferrari and quashed rumours that he would consider taking a year off in 2008 to escape from a teammate he clearly cannot abide. In a bitter relationship that soured almost irretrievably last week, Alonsos latest outburst confirms their feelings  as articulated by the championship-leading Briton last week  are mutual. Id be delighted if I didnt carry on with Hamilton, he said. If we are not together next season and I can go to a good car, then great. If we have to carry on together then we will have another great battle.  Lewis HamiltonAlonso added: It hasnt entered into my plans not to race next year  and I dont have any news about Ferrari. They have a contract with Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa for next year. The likelihood is that Alonso will leave for Renault in a swap deal that sees the talented 25-year-old Finn Heikki Kovalainen, who was second at the Fuji Speedway, moving to McLaren. Alonso at least knows he would be welcomed home at Renault, whose team chief, Flavio Briatore, said on Monday: I told Fernando that the moment he is free  we would be pleased to have him back. Meanwhile, Hamiltons stunning rookie season has sparked unprecedented ticket sales for next years British GP, organisers said on Tuesday. So far 10,000 tickets have been sold for the July 4 to 6 weekend.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND AGENCIES

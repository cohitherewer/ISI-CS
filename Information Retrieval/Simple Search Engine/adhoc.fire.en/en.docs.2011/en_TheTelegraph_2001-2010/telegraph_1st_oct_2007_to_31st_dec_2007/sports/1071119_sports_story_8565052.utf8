 Bengal in meek surrender
A STAFF REPORTER Yusuf had a match haul of 10 wickets Calcutta: Its been a reality check for Bengal. If the first (home) match of their Ranji Trophy Super League Group B campaign had ended in a draw, the second (away) match saw Bharat Aruns men surrender meekly to Baroda. A 10-wicket match haul and a blistering century by the senior Pathan, Yusuf, sealed the visitors fate on the Moti Baug strip in Vadodara on Sunday. A second five-wicket haul by off-spinner Yusuf and leftarm spinner Rajesh Pawars four for 23 brought an end to Bengals second essay. The visitors were skittled out for 86 to lose by an innings and 59 runs. Baroda thus have six points from one match while Bengal have three from two. Only two Bengal batsmen (Wriddhiman Saha and Rana Chowdhury) reached two digits, while first match centurions Manoj Tiwary and Anustup Majumdar failed to tickle the scorers. Laxmi Ratan Shukla, incidentally, opened his account as a skipper. Having got out for two ducks in his previous two knocks, Shukla in his third innings as Bengal captain lasted two balls and scored one.

Panchkula: Brian Lara failed with the bat for third time in a row as Mumbai Champs crashed to a 24-run loss to Delhi Jets in the Indian Cricket League here on Friday night. 
Mumbai Champs third consecutive defeat have virtually thrown them out of the ICLs Twenty20 tournament. 
Chasing a target of 164, Lara, who opened the innings with D. S. Jadhav, but made an early exit in the second over scoring just three runs. He nudged it to wicketkeeper Paul Nixon off man-of-the-match T. Sudhindra. 
Sudhindra wrecked the top order by bagging the wickets of Nathan Astle (4) and Vikram Solanki (4). After their exit, the Champs started disintegrating and in the ninth over they were struggling at five for 50. 
Jadhav (42) kept fighting a losing battle and managed 42 runs of 35 balls before he fell to 17-year-old Ali Murtaza. 
Even a late charge by Merven Dillon (19) could not prevent the inevitable as 27 runs were required by Champs in the final over. The champs ended up with 139 for nine.

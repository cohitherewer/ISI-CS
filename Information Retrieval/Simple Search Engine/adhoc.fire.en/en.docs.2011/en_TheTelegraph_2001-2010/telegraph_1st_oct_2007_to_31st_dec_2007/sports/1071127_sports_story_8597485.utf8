				 																																																				Berlin: There is no evidence that Tommy Haas was poisoned in Germanys Davis Cup semi-final defeat by Russia in Moscow in September, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has concluded. The ITF started an investigation after Alexander Waske, a doubles player on the German team, said he had been told by an unnamed figure in Moscow that Haas had been poisoned during Russias 3-2 win.				 																																																				Following enquiries, the ITF has concluded that there is no medical information or other evidence whatsoever to support recent speculation concerning the medical condition of Tommy Haas during Germanys Davis Cup semi-final tie against Russia, the ITF said in a statement on Monday. There will be no further comment on this subject.				 																																																				Haas said himself this month that blood tests had revealed no evidence of poisoning. 				 																																																				Bangalore: Anand Pawars run at the Scottish Open came to an end when he was beaten in the semi-finals by Japans Kenichi Tago 21-12, 9-21, 19-21.				 																																																				Having won the first game 21-12, Anand could not sustain the pace and lost the second game 9-21. In the decider, Anand led 19-17 but again the Japanese maintained better concentration level and won the next four points and the match at 21-19.				 																																																				The Japanese then went on to win the Scottish Open title, beating German No. 1 Bjoern Joppien in the finals 21-11, 15-21, 18-21. 				 																																																				Sydney: Australias five-time Olympic gold medallist Ian Thorpe said on Monday that he will never fully restore his swimming reputation in the wake of a drugs controversy. A French newspaper in March published details of a urine sample he returned last year that showed abnormal levels of testosterone and leutenising hormone.				 																																																				The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) subsequently found he had no case to answer and international swimming body Fina said earlier this month there was insufficient evidence he took performance-enhancing drugs.				 																																																				I was glad when it was over but its not really over yet and it never will be, Thorpe said. My name is forever tarnished, more so overseas than what its here, thats something i continue to have to deal with.				 																																																				Villarreal: Villarreal reached an agreement quot;in principle quot; with Juan Roman Riquelme on Monday that will allow the out-of-favour Argentina midfielder to rejoin Boca Juniors.

Riquelme leads Argentina with four goals in four World Cup qualifying games despite not having played for Villarreal since falling out with coach Manuel Pellegrini last December.				 																																																				The former Barcelona player moved to Boca Juniors on loan in January and led the Argentine club to its sixth Copa Libertadores trophy. He also helped to lead Argentina to the Copa America final in July. 				 																																																				Sydney: Asian Football officials have written to Fifa, asking them to change one of the dates for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers.

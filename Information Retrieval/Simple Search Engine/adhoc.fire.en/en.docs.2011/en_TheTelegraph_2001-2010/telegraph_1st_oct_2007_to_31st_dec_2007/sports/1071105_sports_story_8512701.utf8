 Kapil, Rameez put India ahead
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTOn Sunday, The Telegraph spoke to three former captains about the ODIs which begin on Monday. Heres what they said (alphabetically): KAPIL DEV: Playing at home, I think the advantage is with India... Having said that, the Pakistani players have this knack of producing something special against India... Well have to wait and see if theres something out of the ordinary. RAMEEZ RAJA: The advantage, to my mind, is with India... The way the Indians played their last two ODIs versus Australia (in Nagpur, Mumbai) was impressive... Pakistan, on the other hand, ended their series against South Africa very poorly (in Lahore)... AAMER SOHAIL: Its difficult to pick the winner... I suppose the team which bats better is going to win... Of course, its a plus for Pakistan that Rahul Dravid has been dropped (for the first two ODIs).

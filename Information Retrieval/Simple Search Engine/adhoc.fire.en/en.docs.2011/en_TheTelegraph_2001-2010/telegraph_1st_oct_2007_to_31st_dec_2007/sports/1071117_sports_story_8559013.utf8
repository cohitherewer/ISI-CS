 Dale shines again vs NZ
Centurion: South African fast bowler Dale Steyn took four wickets to pile the pressure on New Zealand on Day I of the second Test on Friday. New Zealand, who won the toss and chose to bat, lurched to 187 for eight before bad light ended play three overs after tea. A fiery Steyn, who took match figures of 10 for 93 in the first Test in Johannesburg, claimed four for 42. Paceman Makhaya Ntini struck in the eighth over of the match when Michael Papps, who scored nine, played away from his body to a wide delivery and edged a catch to Herschelle Gibbs in the gully. Craig Cumming and Lou Vincent consolidated in a stand that took New Zealand to lunch without further loss. Ten balls into the second session Vincent top-edged a pull to a delivery from Steyn and was caught by Paul Harris at mid-on for 33 to end the partnership at 62. Four overs later, Cumming, who was dropped on 37 before lunch, missed with a hook shot off Steyn and was struck in the face. Cumming retired on 48 and was taken to hospital for an X-ray examination, which revealed a depressed fracture of the cheekbone. New Zealand team management said Cumming would not bat again in the innings and had been taken to a bone specialist in Johannesburg for further assessment. In his next over, Steyn trapped Scott Styris in front for three, leaving fast bowlers Andre Nel and Jacques Kallis to reduce New Zealand to 184 for six at tea. Nel had Ross Taylor caught by Prince in the gully for 17.  (REUTERS)

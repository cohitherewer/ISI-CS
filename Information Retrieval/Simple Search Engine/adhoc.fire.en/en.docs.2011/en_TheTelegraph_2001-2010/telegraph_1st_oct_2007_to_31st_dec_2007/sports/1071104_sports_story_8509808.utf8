 Dravid scores 40 for Karnataka
 Rahul Dravid watches the match after his dismissal Mumbai: Beleaguered former India captain Rahul Dravids hope of a big score was dashed as Ramesh Powar snared him for 40 before completing his five-wicket haul to leave Karnataka reeling at 189 for nine on the day I of their four-day Elite Division Ranji Trophy match Saturday. Dravid, out of the Indian one-day squad for the first two ties against Pakistan after a string of low scores against Australia in the recent home series, came to the crease in the first over itself, batted doggedly for 137 minutes before being caught in the leg trap off a sharply turning Powar ball. Dravids 49-run stand in 21.4 overs with C. Raghu (31) steadied the Karnataka ship after the visitors, choosing to bat first, were gasping at 23 for the loss of openers Barrington Rowland (0) and K B Pawan (11), who were sent back by Ajit Agarkar in a fine first spell of eight overs. But once Dravid fell, Mumbai took the upper hand with Powar utilising the under prepared track very well. Karnataka, 97 for five at one stage, ended the day at a more healthy 189 for nine with allrounder Bhalchandra Akhil doing some fine rearguard action with a fighting, unbeaten knock of 53 in 140 minutes with seven fours. Akhil, who cut well of the back foot, and wicket keeper Thilak Naidu, who made 33, did the repair job with a 48-run sixth wicket stand to pull Karnataka out of the deep rut. At stumps Akhil and last man N C Aiyappa (1) were at the crease, the former having faced 119 balls. Powar picked up five for 69 while Agarkar got two for 24. Meanwhile, in Cuttack, rookie medium-pacer Sudeep Tyagi sliced through Orissas batting capturing six wickets for 46 as the hosts crumbled to 216 all out in their Elite group B match against Uttar Pradesh at the Barabati Stadium on Saturday.

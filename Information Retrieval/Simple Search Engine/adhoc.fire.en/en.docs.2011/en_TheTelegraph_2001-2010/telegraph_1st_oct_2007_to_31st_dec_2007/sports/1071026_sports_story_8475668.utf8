 Team India camp at the Eden 
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Team Indias conditioning camp before the series versus Pakistan will now be held at the Eden Gardens. This was announced by the CAB on Thursday after the BCCI agreed to defer Bengals Ranji Trophy match against Hyderabad by a day. The camp was earlier scheduled to be held at the CC amp;FC as the Eden was due to host the Ranji tie from November 3. The Bengal versus Hyderabad match will now begin on November 4. The camp for Mahendra Singh amp; Co. will be held on November 2 and 3, prior to the first ODI in Guwahati (November 5). CAB president Prasun Mukherjee visited the CC amp;FC on Thursday morning along with former India captain Sourav Ganguly, curator Kalyan Mitra and other officials including assistant secretary Snehasish Ganguly. We can use the floodlights and indoor practice facilities at the Eden. We were earlier forced to opt for the CC amp;FC as the Eden was not available. But I managed to convince the BCCI that the camp should be held at the Eden so as to give the players the best facilities, Mukherjee said.

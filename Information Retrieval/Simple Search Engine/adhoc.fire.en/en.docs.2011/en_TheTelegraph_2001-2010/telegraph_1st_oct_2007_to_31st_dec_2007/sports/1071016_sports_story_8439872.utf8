 Sachin in joint ninth place
A STAFF REPORTER		 Sachin TendulkarCalcutta: India may be 1-4 down in the ongoing ODI series versus Australia, but there is some consolation for the home side in the form of Sachin Tendulkar, who has moved back into the top 10 of LG ICC ODI rankings issued on Monday. The maestro is up three places to joint ninth alongside Chris Gayle of the West Indies in the updated list, according to information received here. Further down the list, Yuvraj Singh (15th) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (16th) are both heading in the right direction. Australias Andrew Symonds is within touching distance of top spot in ODIs. The powerful right-hander, who bludgeoned a brutal 107 from just 88 balls against India in Nagpur on Sunday, has rocketed up six spots to second place and is now just eight rating points behind his captain and team-mate Ricky Ponting. That rise is a reflection of his outstanding form during the ongoing series as he is the leading run-scorer from either side with 365 runs at an average of 91.25, and a strike-rate of 110.94 runs per hundred balls. The news is just as good for Pontings men in the bowling list with left-arm wrist spinner Brad Hogg breaking into the top 10 on the back of being joint leading wicket-taker (alongside teammate Mitchell Johnson) in India with 11 victims.

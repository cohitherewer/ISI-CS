 Kaneria, Sami likely to make Pakistan cut
Karachi: Leg-spinner Danish Kaneria and pacer Mohammed Sami are likely to be included in the Pakistan Test squad for the forthcoming three-match series against India. Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said Kaneria, Sami and batsman Faisal Iqbal are likely to replace Imran Nazir, Fawad Alam and Rao Iftikhar Anjum, who will return after the one-day series ends on Sunday. A national selector, however, made it clear that the final decision would be taken after discussions with the tour selection committee in India. The tour selection committees views will be very important They have to decide whom they want for the Test series, he said. The tour selection committee ignored Fawad and Nazir in the first three one-dayers of the five-match series, which Pakistan are trailing 1-2. Sami has been impressive in the ongoing domestic season, having taken 17 wickets, and is seen as a strong contender for a spot in the Test squad in view of Mohammed Asifs elbow injury.  (AGENCIES)

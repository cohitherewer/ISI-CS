 Pak coast to win in warm-up
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Salman Butt in action in Delhi on Friday. (AFP) New Delhi: The cricket wasnt serious but the spectators were. On Friday, at the Kotla, a strong crowd of 15,000 turned up to watch the warm up match between the visiting Pakistan team and Delhi. Though the game  eventually won by Pakistan by six wickets  was played in a light mood, there was no dearth of response from spectators. People formed long queues outside the stadium early in the morning and police had a tough time to control the rush. With the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) deciding to make entry free, stands on the A and B wings were completely packed long before Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik beat Gautam Gambhir on the spin of coin and put Delhi to bat. Since there was no competitive interest, both teams decided to use 13 players each. As usual the biggest cheers were reserved for star fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar every time he came to bowl or stepped out of the pavilion. The Rawalpindi Express didnt bowl at a great speed though. He took things easily and bowled more with the aim of striking rhythm before the series than intimidating the batsmen with pace. In 10 overs, he captured just a wicket and gave away 46 runs. Delhi coach Vijay Dahiya later said he was happy the way his batsmen handled Shoaib. Delhi, however, didnt go beyond 213 for nine in 50 overs. It would have been much less had not number six batsman Rajat Bhatia hit a fine 75 in 106 deliveries with the help of seven boundaries and one six. Delhi were without Ishant Sharma, Ashish Nehra (both injured) and Virender Sehwag. Apart from Bhatia, Shikhar Dhawan also played a solid innings of 52 in 81 balls. In reply, Pakistan batsmen played some entertaining innings and reached the target easily. The best came from Salman Butt who made 83 off 84 balls and made way for other batsmen. In the end, Butt was richer by Rs 40,000 as he was declared Man of the Match. While Younis Khan was named the Best Bowler (Rs 20,000), Rajat Bhatia received the Best Batsman award (Rs 20,000).

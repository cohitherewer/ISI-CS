 Bengal eves coach eyes the summit
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: The newly appointed Bengal womens coach Chandana Mukherjee feels that Bengal have the potential to emerge champions in the Inter-State Senior Womens meet of two-day and one-day matches. For the first time playing under the CAB banner, Jhulan Goswami-led Bengal have already made their intentions clear thumping Assam in back to back matches. We boast of nine allrounders (Jhulan, Rituparna Roy, Priyanka Roy, Ria Chowdhury, Beas Sarkar, Khathakali Banerjee, Bobby Ghatak, Annesha Mitra and Payal Dev) in the team Its a big advantage. Then there is Ananya Mitra who is very good wicketkeeping batswoman, Mukherjee, who has been appointed Bengal eves coach for the Inter-State meet, told The Telegraph. Jhulans inclusion is a big advantage. Her presence alone lifts the team spirit, said the coach. The ICC Womens Cricketer of the Year, Jhulan could not play under Bengal banner earlier due to technical reasons. Mukherjee however said her immediate target is the next match. Were taking one match at a time At the moment, Im focussing on our tie against Tripura tomorrow. The coach said results are bound to improve as the state association has taken up the womens wing. Its an excellent development. Earlier we did not get any facilities. However with the CAB taking up the big advantage would be that of the infrastructure, Mukherjee added.

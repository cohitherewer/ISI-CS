 2-0 win for Liverpool
 James Milner of Newcastle celebrates after scoring against Sunderland during their Premier League match at The Stadium of Light on Saturday. (AFP) London: Liverpool scored twice in the last nine minutes to beat Fulham 2-0 to move up to fourth in the Premier League on Saturday. The home side, who scored eight against Besiktas in the Champions League on Tuesday, were frustrated by a resolute Fulham side who held out until substitute Fernando Torres struck from close range with his left foot after 81 minutes. Steven Gerrard converted a penalty four minutes later to give manager Rafa Benitez victory in his 200th match in charge. Elsewhere, West Ham United won 5-0 at bottom club Derby County and Sunderland drew 1-1 with Newcastle United in their north-east derby. Six matches will be played on Sunday while leaders Arsenal visit Reading on Monday. Liverpool have 24 points from 12 matches with Arsenal (27), Manchester United (27) and Manchester City (25) above them. West Hams victory over Derby was their biggest in the Premier League since December 2000. Three of West Hams goals came in an eight-minute spell in the second half as Billy Daviess hapless Derby recorded their fifth successive game without a goal, the clubs worst run since 1920. Derby have six points from 13 matches while West Ham move up to ninth with 18 points from 12. Lee Bowyer put West Ham ahead after 42 minutes before Matthew Etherington (51), an own goal from Eddie Lewis (55), a second from Bowyer (59) and a free kick by Nolberto Solano (69) piled on the home teams misery. Sunderland, without a league win in six games and a home victory over Newcastle since 1980, went ahead after 52 minutes when Danny Higginbotham headed his first goal for the club. Newcastle equalised 13 minutes later as James Milners cross-cum-shot went in off the far post. In Germany, champions VfB Stuttgart handed Bayern Munich their first defeat of the season on Saturday, beating the Bundesliga leaders 3-1.  (REUTERS)

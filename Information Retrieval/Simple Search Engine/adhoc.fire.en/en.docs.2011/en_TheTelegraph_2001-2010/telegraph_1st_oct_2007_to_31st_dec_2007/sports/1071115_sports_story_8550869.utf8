 Bengal face Mhambrey challenge
A STAFF REPORTER Manoj Tiwary Calcutta: Bengal in their second round Ranji Super League Group B match face Baroda in an away match. But the battle between the two teams is more likely to be off the field than on it  between the two coaches Paras Mhambrey and Bharat Arun. More so, after his boys failed to register an outright win (five points) and settled for a draw (three points) against Hyderabad in their first round encounter at the Eden Gardens. The Mhambrey factor has already started to play a role with Bengal being offered a turner strip at the Moti Bagh Stadium. But Bengal have an answer in Murtaza Lodhgar (left arm spinner) and Sourashish Lahiri (off-spinner) for Barodas Rajesh Pawar and Yusuf Pathan. Its going to be a spinning track, no doubt about it , Arun told The Telegraph from Vadodara. In Amitava Chakrabortys absence (hamstring injury), Anustup Majumdar will open with Arindam Das. Skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla is expected to bat at No. 3. Amitava is replaced by Kamal Hasan Mandal, while the team think tank is planning to bring in southpaw Rana Chowdhury in place of Safi Ahmed.An unbeaten 111 in his debut match (vs Hyderabad) means that its a promotion up the order for wicketkeeper batsman Wriddhiman Saha (No. 5). Manoj Tiwary, who scored 203 against Hyderabad, however will remain at his fourth spot. TEAMS Bengal (likely): Laxmi Ratan Shukla (captain), Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Arindam Das, Kamal Hasan Mandal, Manoj Tiwary, Anustup Majumdar, Rana Chowdhury, Sourashish Lahiri, Shib Shankar Paul, Ranadeb Bose and Murtaza Lodhgar Baroda (from): Connor Williams (captain), Azharuddin Bilakhia, Abhimanyu Chauhan, Shatrunjay Gaekwad, Hamid Ali Saiyed, K. Panchal, Satyajit Parab, Vishwanath Parmar, Pragnesh Patel, Yusuf Pathan, Rajesh Pawar, Pinal Shah (wk), Rakesh Solanki, Sumit Mahatim Singh and Sankalp Vohra.

 Indians confident of getting through
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: On June 9, 2006, AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi had launched his Vision 2010 plan with lot of fanfare. The project was aimed at ensuring Indias qualification for the World Cup in South Africa. The 14-month old project, however over-ambitious it was, now faces the prospect of a first-round death when India take on Lebanon in Chennai on Sunday. After a high in the Nehru Cup, Indian football was brought crushing down to earth in Beirut when Lebanon handed out a 4-1 rout to Bob Houghtons men in the away outing. India now have an arduous task on the rain marred slippery surface of the Nehru Stadium as they need a 3-0 win to stay in contention. Though Houghton has put up a brave face and said he was looking forward to stand up to the task, achieving the target seems to be a difficult job. Keeping 3-0 win in mind would not be the right way of looking at things, said the British coach after the evening practice session. Instead, leading 1-0 at the half time would be a wonderful idea. Then we can go into the second half thinking about doing our job in a more appropriate manner. Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia also echoed his coachs words. We are not here to play with a calculator, the star striker said. The match would be played on the ground. We are hoping to achieve the desired result. To add to Indias woes, both left back NS Manju and left midfielder Rennedy Singh are not yet fit to play. Though Houghton has named Samir Naik and K. Ajayan as replacements, he would take a final decision on Manju only on Sunday morning. The fixture made by AFC is a catastrophe. You cant throw out a team just after one match. Lebanon might be without their playmaker Roda Antar but the west Asian side still has enough firepower to torment the Indians. The man to watch would be striker Mohammed Ghaddar, who mesmerised the Indian defence with a double striker in Beirut. Monsoon has descended on Chennai and India are hoping to take advantage of the wet ground conditions at the Nehru Stadium. Lebanon coach Emile Ruston, however, dismissed any such notion and said: Rain wont be any problem. We are used to playing under such conditions.

(AP) Faisalabad: Another splendid innings from Mohammed Yousuf led Pakistan to a six-wicket win over South Africa in the third one-dayer at the Iqbal Stadium on Tuesday. Yousuf followed up scores of 53 and 117 with an unbeaten 58 as Pakistan reached their target of 198 with 11 balls to spare to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. The experienced Yousuf shared a stand of 79 with captain Shoaib Malik (42) and an unbroken partnership of 55 with Misbah-ul Haq (29 not out). Earlier, South Africa were bowled out for 197 in 49.2 overs. Skipper Graeme Smith top-scored with 48 while Justin Kemp contributed 42. Shahid Afridi (three for 37) and Rao Iftikhar (three for 33) made the visitors rue their decision to bat first as they lost their last six wickets for 35 runs. Afridi, promoted to opener, then gave the Pakistan reply a rousing start by smashing 32 from 18 balls with two sixes and four fours on a pitch that was slow and sluggish. When Afridi was caught by Smith at mid-off from Shaun Pollocks bowling, the hosts struggled to maintain the same scoring rate. Yasir Hameed (18) fell driving at a wide ball from Makhaya Ntini and Younis Khan went for 10 when he flicked Albie Morkel to Johan Botha at short mid-wicket. Yousuf and Malik steadied the innings before the skipper was caught behind trying to cut Morkel in the 39th over. Misbah then joined forces with Yousuf to clinch victory. Earlier, Afridi dismissed Jacques Kallis (13), Kemp (42) and Shaun Pollock (one) to trigger a middle-order slump from which they could not recover. South Africa, reduced to 77 for three in 20 overs, was lifted by captain Graeme Smith (48) and Kemp, who shared a fourth-wicket stand of 45 off 75 balls but they never looked in command. Herschelle Gibbs, who scored a century in the first match, fell in the ninth over when he edged Umar Gul to wicketkeeper after scoring 19. Gibbs, on 10, completed 7,000 one-day runs, to become only the second South African behind Kallis to achieve the milestone. Kallis, who made eight and nought in the first two matches, failed once again as he miscued a drive off Afridi and was well caught in the covers by Misbah for 13. AB de Villiers, the best South Africa batsman in the series with 103 not out and 35, made just 17 before his uppish drive off Iftikhar was smartly snapped up by Afridi at mid-wicket. Smith and Kemp steadied the innings, taking the score to 122. Smith, who remained on 18 for 10 overs, was run out in the 33rd over when he failed to beat a throw from Shoaib Malik to the strikers end. South Africa lost Mark Boucher (17) to spinner Abdul Rehman as the tourists lost their last six wickets for just 35 runs. The fourth match will be played in Multan on Friday.  (AGENCIES)

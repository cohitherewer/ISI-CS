 Faisal: Jaffer left me speechless
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Pakistans young Faisal Iqbal, who has been included in place of injured Shoaib Malik for the second Test, was left speechless by Wasim Jaffers innings on Friday. Jaffer played really well... I am speechless... It was tremendous to watch him, said Faisal. He did not wish to get into the debate surrounding a half-fit Shoaib Akhtar. It was the decision of the team management to include him. All the 11 are fit now... For the last three-four days Shoaib was not fit, but the way he bowled today and the aggression he has showed was really remarkable, he said. Is the wicket tailormade for batsmen? The wicket behaves differently each day. We have to attack with full force tomorrow and get the breakthroughs, he added. Faisal said he was mentally and physically ready to play on Friday. Did he receive any special tips from uncle Javed Miandad before the India tour? The tour of India is always demanding I did ask him some things. But I have also been playing cricket for some time now and have been travelling a lot. I got a 100 the last time India played in Karachi.

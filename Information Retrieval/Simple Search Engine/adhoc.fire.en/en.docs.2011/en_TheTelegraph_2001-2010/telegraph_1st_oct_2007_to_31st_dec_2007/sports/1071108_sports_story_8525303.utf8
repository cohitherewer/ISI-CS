 Give Dhoni a long stint: Pak duo
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTMohali: Former Pakistan captain Aamer Sohail said on Wednesday that Sachin Tendulkars decision to reject Test captaincy should be treated with utmost respect. Speaking to The Telegraph, Sohail said: Sachin is a hugely experienced and a revered cricketer. It was his decision and one must respect it. No one knows it better than Sachin as he has been around longer than most. The former captain felt Mahendra Singh Dhoni would do a fine job as Test captain too. He should be given the captaincy on a long-term basis though, Sohail said, adding: The team management should guide him and have confidence in him. He should be backed during the series in Australia and shouldnt be criticised for few failures here and there. Sohails views were echoed by Rameez Raja, another former Pakistan captain.  A new captain should always be backed, so that he does his job in the right spirit, Rameez said. Dhoni is sharp and has an uncluttered mind. He should be given a long-term responsibility. On Sachins decision not to lead India for the third time, Rameez said it was his call. Given Tendulkars experience, it would have been good to get him as the leader in Tests. I feel he does not want to take extra pressure at this point of his career. I see nothing wrong in it.

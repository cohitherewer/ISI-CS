 Daniela earns Madrid berth
Linz: Slovakias Daniela Hantuchova defeated Patty Schnyder of Switzerland 6-4, 6-2 on Sunday to win the Linz Open. Victory also earned her the final place in the eight-player field for the WTA Championships in Madrid from November 6. Hantuchova ended the race with the same number of points as Russian Maria Sharapova, who also qualified when Venus Williams withdrew after suffering dizziness at the US Open. The American is still undergoing tests to determine the cause. It was Hantuchovas fourth final of the year and her second title, after she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova to win Indian Wells in March. It cant get any better, Hantuchova told reporters. Its a dream coming true for me. All the work throughout the year has really been paying off and all this happening today and in Madrid is just going to be a great bonus for me. I didnt get too much sleep this week, Ill be honest. It was tough at times, and especially being able to block that away and to be able to play my game proved just how much stronger Ive become mentally the last few months. Thats why the win this week has been that much more sweet, having to get through all this stuff about the Championships, she added. Schnyder hit two double-faults in her opening service game and had to fight off two break points before holding for 1-1. However, she earned the first break, taking a 3-2 lead when second-seeded Hantuchova put a forehand wide.  (REUTERS)

 Jaques cracks century
A STAFF REPORTER Jaques Calcutta: After 10 months of speculation over who would fill Australias three vacant Test positions, Phil Jaques hinted that at least one of those spots is in safe hands. Jaques celebrated his first match as a full-time member of the side with a century as Australia fought off Muttiah Muralidharans wiles to reach 242 for three at stumps on Day I of the first Test in Brisbane, according to www. cricinfo. com. Michael Hussey was on 28 and Michael Clarke had reached five at the close, leaving Sri Lanka to regret their decision to send Australia in on a Gabba pitch tinged with green. At least the predicted showers stayed away for most of the day  75 minutes were lost in the morning  and allowed Jaques to overcome his nervy start to settle into the openers role with an even 100. His century came off 196 balls with a confident back-foot drive forward of point for four off Chaminda Vaas. The milestone had only just arrived when Muralidharan enjoyed a well-earned reward with his deception of Jaques, who was not the only batsman troubled by Muralidharans efforts. He made his first inroads into the nine wickets he required to overtake Shane Warnes Test record of 708 victims when he also had Ricky Ponting stumped with a sharp piece of work from Prasanna Jayawardene. After a lengthy spell over the wicket, Muralidharan moved around the wicket and it took only four balls for the angle to unnerve Ponting, who pushed at a straighter delivery angled across him and briefly dragged his foot just centimetres out of safe ground. Ponting fell just short of his Test average, scoring 56, and it was a typical Ponting innings, punctuated by classical cover drives and a couple of lofted fours over mid off from Muralidharan. It took the brilliance of Muralidharan to remove Ponting after he and Jaques had brought the score to 183 for one. The pair dictated terms to Sri Lanka, not so much to Muralidharan but to the three-man seam attack of Vaas, Farveez Mahroof and Dilhara Fernando. Sri Lanka missed their fastest weapon, Lasith Malinga, who was overlooked to allow Mahroof into the side as they predicted sharp movement on the first morning. Mahela Jayawardene played his part by winning the toss and choosing to field but after Jaques played out the first over from Vaas, the rain came and ate away an hour of the time Sri Lanka had hoped to use to earn an advantage. When play resumed Jaques was shaky but Matthew Hayden ensured Australia were not outfoxed. Haydens 43 included several typically aggressive strokes preceded by his walk at the bowler, however it was one of those shots that brought his downfall. Hayden advanced to Vaas and tried to drive over the bowlers head, but he skied the ball wide of the mid-off, Muralidharan, who ran 15 paces to his right at full speed to take an excellent catch. It was the only wicket claimed by pace all day as the fast bowlers failed to help Muralidharan build pressure. Fernandos efforts were particularly frustrating for Sri Lanka, as he achieved the treble of consistently spraying the ball too wide, too short and too full.

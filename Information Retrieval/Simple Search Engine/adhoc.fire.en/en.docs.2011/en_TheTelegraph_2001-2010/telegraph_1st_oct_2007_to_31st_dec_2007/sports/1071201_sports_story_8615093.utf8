 Series much bigger than Ashes: Asif
A STAFF REPORTER Asif Iqbal and Mohammed Azharuddin at the Eden on Friday Calcutta: Debut match is always a moment to cherish; so is a players last appearance. But it becomes tragic if a swansong is cut short in the form of a run out. Former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal is the victim of such a circumstance. Iqbals sparkling career ended in a run out (involving Javed Miandad) in 1979-80. But that 15 in the second innings at the Eden (Jan. 29-Feb. 3, 1980) is something the 64-year-old still cherishes. I treasure each moment of my last match at the Eden  my favourite venue I wont say I was unlucky. I never regret in life..., said the former Pakistan captain. Iqbal is a CAB special invitee for the second India-Pakistan Test. Its good to be back here Mere presence is quite nostalgic, he added. The former Pakistan batsman criticised the inclusion of an unfit Shoaib Akhtar in the playing XI. I really dont think he (Shoaib) was 100 per cent fit... He was just playing because of the requirement, which is unfair. A player should not be fielded if he less than 100 per cent fit  be it Shoaib or anybody else, he told The Telegraph on the sidelines of first days proceedings. Struggling during his run-up, the Rawalpindi Express bowled just nine overs. Iqbal, a dashing right-hander who has played nine Tests against India, added that the rivalry between the two teams is bigger than the Ashes. India-Pakistan rivalry is different No series can be bigger than an India-Pakistan series This is the toughest of all... Much bigger than the Ashes. However, he felt that the current Pakistan bunch lack experience. Its a young bunch. Youve got to be patient; give them some time and Im sure they will do well. Its good that the PCB is backing Shoaib Malik. Age is on his side and Im sure captaining Pakistan in an away series versus India will give him a lot of experience Theres enough scope to learn. Among the young guns, the former Pakistan great picked left-arm medium-pacer Sohail Tanveer. Allrounder Fawad Alam and wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed are the two others whom Pakistan can look forward to, he said. On the three-Test series, he said: I cant predict what will be the result But Indians are the favourites. Iqbal thought Anil Kumble was doing an exceptionally good job. He did a marvellous job at the Kotla. Having served Indian cricket for so long, its (captaincy) a reward for him, the Hyderabad-born Pakistan batsman signed off.

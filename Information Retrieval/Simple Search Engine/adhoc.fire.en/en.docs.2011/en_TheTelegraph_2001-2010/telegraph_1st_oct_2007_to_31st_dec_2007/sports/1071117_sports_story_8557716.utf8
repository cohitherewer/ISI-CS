 Wish Sachin could play forever, says Cullinan
A STAFF REPORTER		Calcutta Tigers rsquo; Deep Dasgupta with South African coach Daryll Cullinan 
		 at the CC amp;FC on Friday. A Telegraph pictureCalcutta: Former South African batsman Daryll Cullinan is impressed by Sachin Tendulkars accomplishments to such an extent that he feels the maestro should go on forever. Tendulkar has managed his career in a fantastic mannerIts a pleasure to watch him bat, Cullinan, who is here to coach Calcutta Tigers in the Indian Cricket League (ICL), said on Friday. To put it in one word, he is a perfect batsman and the way he has been playing over 18 years is amazing, the South African maintained. Asked if Sachin has a shelf life, Cullinan said: He should play as long as he wants I even wish he goes on (playing) forever. Cullinan was also against the idea of axing seniors without setting up a proper bench. You cannot judge someone by age As long as the seniors are performing they should be persisted with and age shouldnt come in their way. Besides, you have to see whether you have enough resources to fill in those slots, he said. Taking a dig at the BCCI for blacklisting the ICL, the Calcutta Tigers coach said: I dont understand what is this politics all about. Players who want to play should play and it shouldnt be a concern for others. Reverting to the topic on South African cricket, the former Proteas batting mainstay admitted the game had changed a lot and Graeme Smiths boys were better than the ones of his time. The current bunch looks fitter too, he said. Cullinan will be joined by his one-time teammate Lance Kluesener in Calcutta Tigers as a player. Klusener didnt attend the first days practice at the CC amp;FC, but he was present at the news conference alongside Cullinan and Sri Lankan allrounder Upul Chandana. Klusener is hopeful about the future of Twenty20. Im not sure if it will be the future of cricket, but it represents great fun and ambience during the three-and-a-half hours of duration, Klusener said. Klusener also rated Cullinan as one of the best coaches, saying the team will be benefited by Darylls experience, he said. New Zealands Craig McMillan is expected to arrive here on Saturday morning.

 Railways champions

Puducherry: Indian Railways extended their lease over the womens title for yet another year defeating arch-rivals Delhi 95-74 in the final of the 58th National Basketball Championship here on Friday. Railways led 43-35 at the break. 
Railways were superior in all departments of the game and coach Satya Prakashs decision to rotate the players making use of the strong bench with seven internationals paid rich dividends. Delhi lacked tall players to counter their rivals. 
Railways, who led by eight points at the break doubled their lead (71-55) in the penultimate third quarter. Delhi could not raise their game as they found it difficult to wriggle out of tight situations created by Railway stars. (PTI)

 No sympathy for Symonds from Border, Mark Waugh
Mumbai/Melbourne: The debate over alleged racist remarks made against Andrew Symonds by spectators in Vadodara continued on Monday. Captain Ricky Ponting on Monday said no Indian or Australian player has made a big deal about the issue. Former Aussie players Mark Waugh and Allan Border, on the other hand, felt that the allrounder was acting precious. I dont think Symonds made too much of it. It was not him but the Match Referee who brought up the issue Symonds has dealt with it in the most sensible and mature way, he said. Ponting, who was speaking on the sidelines of a promotional, said the alleged racial abuse issue had been highlighted by the Indian media. When pointed out that Australian players had been penalised in the past for racism, Ponting said: Australians found guilty in the past have been penalised. What we would like is to have racism totally eradicated from all sporting events. Symonds was allegedly subjected to racial taunts while fielding during the fifth ODI in Vadodara. The visitors did not lodge a complaint. Waugh suggested just making monkey noises did not amount to racism. What is Symonds complaining about  monkey noises? he said during a TV programme. Does that come down to racism, without any words being said? I dont know. Waugh, who toured India several times, said such taunts were part of the game. It didnt worry me. I dont know if we are getting a bit precious here, really, he said. Former captain Border agreed that the fans always tried to irritate visiting sides. There have always been taunts from crowds, from as long as I can remember, he said. Symondss teammate Brett Lee echoed his captains words and said there was no ill feeling between the teams. The relationship we have with the present Indian team is better than ever before. There have been no problems in the past and I hope there will be none in the future, Lee said. We cant control what happens off the field while we are playing. He said players from both teams were great friends off the field and had respect for each other. The incident has been taken up by the Australian Cricketers Association and the Federation of International Cricketers (Fica).  (Agencies)

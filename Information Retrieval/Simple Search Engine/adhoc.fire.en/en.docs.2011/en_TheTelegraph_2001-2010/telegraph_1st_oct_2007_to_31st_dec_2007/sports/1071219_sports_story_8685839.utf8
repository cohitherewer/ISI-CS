 Tait, Hogg in XII for Melbourne

Sydney: Fast bowler Shaun Tait and allrounder Brad Hogg have been recalled to the Australia side for the first Test against India starting at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on December 26. 
Tait was recalled to the 12-man squad after missing last months series against Sri Lanka with injury, while Hogg replaces leg-spinner Stuart MacGill, who has been ruled out after undergoing wrist surgery. 
Australias chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement that the final starting XI would not be named until the day of the match but both players deserved their recalls. 
Were obviously very pleased with the Test team results so far this summer, but the injury to Stuart MacGill has forced a change to the side, Hilditch said. 
Brad Hogg replaces MacGill in the squad of 12, based on his Pura Cup (first-class) performances to date and his consistent performance for the one-day International team in that form of the game. 
Brad deserves the opportunity to once again represent Australia in Test cricket. 
Tait was originally chosen for the two-match series against Sri Lanka but was forced to withdraw after injuring his elbow. He was replaced in the squad by Ben Hilfenhaus, who did not play in either Test, but was included after proving his fitness. 
Shaun regains his place in the Australian squad, having been our initial selection in Brisbane, Hilditch said. 
Now hes fully recovered from injury he retakes his place in the 12. 
THE SQUAD 
Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Stuart Clark, Michael Clarke, Matthew Hayden, Brad Hogg, Mike Hussey, Phil Jaques, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Andrew Symonds, Shaun Tait.

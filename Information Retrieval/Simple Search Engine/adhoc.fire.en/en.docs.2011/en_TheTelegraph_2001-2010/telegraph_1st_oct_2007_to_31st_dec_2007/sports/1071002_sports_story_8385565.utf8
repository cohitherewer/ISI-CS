 Grand welcome planned for Anand too
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: The All India Chess Federation (AICF), taking a leaf out of the BCCIs book, is planning a grand public reception for Viswanathan Anand when he arrives in Chennai later this month. Speaking to The Telegraph on Monday, AICF treasurer Bharat Singh Chauhan said a special chariot would be made to carry Anand from the airport to his home in Chennai. Though things are yet to be finalised, we are planning a rathyatra for our champion, said Chauhan, one of the bigwigs of the AICF in the post-Umer Koya days. We are not as rich as the BCCI but will do everything to make it a memorable day for Indian chess. The AICF is also planning a big public function to felicitate Anand on the same day. Some of the top dignitaries of world chess will be present on the occasion. We are trying to get Fide president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov and (invite) some other big names. Sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will also be requested to attend the function, said Chauhan. The AICF, however, is not too sure when the world champion in likely to return to India. Anand has not given us a specific date but he is expected at the end of the month, said AICF secretary D.V. Sundar. The sooner he comes, the better. Otherwise, people may forget the feat. Unlike the hockey or billiards and snooker federations, the AICF is not upset with the fact that the government so far hasnt announced any financial reward for one of Indias greatest sportspersons. As it is we receive a substantial fund from the government, said Chauhan. We have no complaints. The only time we do feel bad is when no one recognises our junior champions. Indians have been doing extremely well on the world junior circuit but they are yet to receive government backing. Also last month GM-norm holder Tania Sachdev won the Asian womens championship, but Chauhan said her feat was hardly noticed by the government.

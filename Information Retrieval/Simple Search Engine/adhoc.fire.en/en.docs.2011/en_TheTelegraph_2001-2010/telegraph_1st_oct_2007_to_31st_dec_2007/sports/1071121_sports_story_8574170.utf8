 Tyson reports to prison
Phoenix: Mike Tyson reported to jail Tuesday to serve his one-day sentence for a DUI conviction. The former heavyweight champion will be at Tent City, an open-air jail near a dog pound and junk yard. The former heavyweight boxing champion, who pleaded guilty in September to drug possession and driving under the influence, was sentenced by a judge on Monday to 10 days in jail, but will only serve one as reported in our Tuesday late city edition. In addition to jail time for the driving offence, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Helene Abrams ordered Tyson to serve three years probation on each count and perform 360 hours of community service. The latest charges stemmed from a traffic stop in Scottsdale on December 29 after the boxer had spent the evening at Scottsdales Pussycat Lounge and was seen driving erratically. An officer said he saw Tyson wiping a white substance off the dashboard of his black BMW, and that his speech was slurred. Authorities said they found bags of cocaine in Tysons pocket and in his car. Tyson told officers later that he used cocaine whenever he could get his hands on it, and that he preferred to smoke it in Marlboro cigarettes with the tobacco pulled out, according to court documents. There were 2.16 grams of cocaine in several bags in his possession at the time and traces of marijuana in his system, prosecutors told the court in September. The boxer also told police that he used marijuana that day and was taking the antidepressant Zoloft, the documents state. (AGENCIES)

 CA criticised over rights row
Brisbane: Cricket Australia (CA) came under fire on Friday for imposing restrictions that have locked global news agencies out of the Australia-Sri Lanka Test in Brisbane. The worlds top three global news agencies  Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Associated Press  suspended all coverage of the 2007-08 cricket season, also involving India, unless a deal can be agreed with CA. Chris Warren, the alliances federal secretary, criticised the CAs attitude as greedy. News coverage should not be up for sale; that is the basic issue at stake here, Warren said in a statement on Friday. CA needs to remember, first and last, that a Test match involving the national team is a public event and news about it should be freely available to the public. At present CA is simply being greedy.

 Kapur 26th, Jeev 44th 
 Shiv Kapur Kochi: Shiv Kapur played his best golf of the week for a final-round two-under 70 to finish tied 26th even as Jeev Milkha Singhs one-under 71 saw him sign off tied 44th in the $1.3 million Casio World Open here on Sunday. Defending champion Jeev, whose title hopes were dashed after a disastrous 76 on Saturday, ended with a total of two-over 290. Kapur, on the other hand, finished with a level-par 288. Playing his back nine first, Jeev made an ominous start by stumbling to an 11th hole bogey but drew even with a birdie on the 13th. Making the turn even-par, Jeev picked up birdies on the second and seventh but a bogey on the third denied him a better finish. Kapur, a 10th tee starter, also dropped a shot on the 11th to make the turn one-over. However, the young Delhi golfer made up for the lapse with back-to-back birdies on the first and second hole. He struck a birdie on the fourth to end the tournament on a bright note. Local favourite Taichi Teshima sank in birdies on the last two holes to return a seven-under 65 and win the title by one stroke with a total of 275. Overnight leader, Australian Chris Campbell (69) finished a stroke behind while Korean I. J. Chang (69) ended third with 277.  (PTI)

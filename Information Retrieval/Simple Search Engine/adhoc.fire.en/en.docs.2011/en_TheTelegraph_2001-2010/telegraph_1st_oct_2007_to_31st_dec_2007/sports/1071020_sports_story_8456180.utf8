 Well stay positive: Uthappa 
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT (From left) Ricky Ponting, Andrew Symonds and Brad Hodge play rugby during training in Mumbai on Friday. (Reuters) Mumbai: Robin Uthappa has promised the same intensity and aggression that won India the ICC World Twenty20 title in South Africa when they take on Australia on Saturday. The team which won in South Africa has met again after we split in Mumbai (on return) So the atmosphere in the dressing room will be the same. Most of us have been playing together since the Under 17 and Under-19 days. We believe in being very positive, and we will play aggressive cricket, Uthappa said. We are the world champions. Playing conditions and wickets were different in South Africa, and it would be a new experience playing Twenty20 in India. It is a 20-over game, and can change in five balls. Whoever plays well will win. The key is to go out there and enjoy playing without fear of committing mistakes Uthappa said Sehwag had a son Thursday night and was expected to reach Mumbai late on Friday evening. On Pontings statement that the Aussies were not viewing the match as a means to get even at the hosts, Uthappa said: Australia have been looking forward to this more than us. They want to beat us. Asked if he felt the team would face a hostile reception when India tour Down Under, Uthappa said the tour was a long way off, and the players were now looking forward to the break before the series versus Pakistan.

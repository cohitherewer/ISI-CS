 Dravid dropped, not rested
 - I was a party to the decision, says chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHIMumbai: Expectedly, the official word was rested, but the reality is that former captain Rahul Dravid got dropped for the final ODI versus Australia. The last time hed been treated similarly was way back in September 1998, during the Sahara Cup face-off against Pakistan in Toronto. Yes, I was a party to todays decision, confirmed chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar in a chat with The Telegraph, dismissing talk that the move had been authored exclusively by captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and vice-captain Yuvraj Singh. Significantly, just over a week ago, after the win in Chandigarh, Dhoni had declared there were no replacements for the seniors. That they added much value to the team. The decision to drop Dravid was taken during Wednesday mornings team meeting and, so, he would have got the bad news in the presence of juniors. The night before, the former captain had been wondering where he would be asked to bat. Indeed, while Dravid scored only 51 in five matches (he didnt bat in the series-opener, in Bangalore), he got pushed up and down the batting order: No.5, No.4, No.5, No.3 and No.4. Hardly confidence-enhancing for somebody struggling to regain the form shown as recently as the seven ODIs in England. Ponting on Dravid  quot; Yes, I was a bit surprised at Rahul Dravid rsquo;s exclusion hellip; He didn rsquo;t get too many runs in the series, but he rsquo;s such a class player and has won many matches for India hellip; I don rsquo;t know what the future holds for him in one-day cricket, but I wish him well. quot;But while Dravid didnt make the XI here, his services are bound to be needed when Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif arrive in a fortnight. Some may cynically say one down, two (Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly) to go, but Dravid remains our most accomplished bat. Technique-wise, certainly. Moreover, in England, his strike-rate was 97-plus. Both Sachin and Dravid are 34, while Sourav is a year older. On the face of it, then, Dravids omission has to be seen as a message for the Big Two. By the way, coming off an injury, Sourav had been rested in Hyderabad. However, theres no guarantee that the younger replacements will succeed. At the Wankhede, for example, Dinesh Karthik (who took Dravids place) failed to get off the mark. Im amazed how Dravids form became such an issue Had he been an Australian, there wouldnt have been any discussion and the think-tank would have backed him, remarked the iconic Barry Richards. The Australian environment, though, is quite different.

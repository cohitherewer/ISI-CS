 Younis, Yousuf hold the key, says Smith 
 Yousuf has undergone a precautionary knee scan Lahore: South African captain Graeme Smith believes performance of Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf will hold Pakistans key during their tour of India. I think their experience on the tour of India is going to be very, very important. They are two quality batsmen at the moment, probably the lifeline of their batting. They control large majority of their batting, Smith said after sealing the ODI series 3-2 against Pakistan here on Monday night. Younis and Yousuf were the standout batsmen for Pakistan in the Test and one-day series against the Proteas as the former scored two hundreds in the Tests and the latter returned to the team with three half-centuries and a hundred in the one-day rubber. Yousuf, however, has undergone a precautionary MRI scan on a bruised knee before the teams departure for the tour of India. Team manager Talat Ali said Yousuf had complained of pain in his knee after being struck by a ball during the one-day series against South Africa. He was in some pain so we decided to have the precautionary MRI scans. But hopefully it is nothing serious, he said. Smith also praised the comeback performance of fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who took four wickets in the final match, after serving a ban for 13 international matches. We know what he is capable off and he showed it again against us. He is their main strike option always, Smith said. The left-handed opener said that the Test and one-day series wins in Pakistan could mark a huge step forward for South African cricket. It is a fabulous achievement for us and a huge stepping stone. After the World Cup people questioned our ability to play in these conditions. This series win is a big step forward for South African cricket. It is always a big challenge touring Pakistan for any team because of the lot of stuff that comes with it. Coming and playing in conditions you are not accustomed too is tough, Smith maintained.

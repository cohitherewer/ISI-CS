 Praveen helps Red stop Green
 India Reds Gautam Gambhir en route to his 73 in Ahmedabad on Friday. (PTI) Ahmedabad: Superb half centuries by Subramaniam Badrinath and Gautam Gambhir helped India Red post an 88-run win over India Green in the second match of the N.K.P. Salve Challenger Trophy on Friday. India Red had gone down to India Blue on Thursday. The finalists will be decided after Saturdays match between India Blue and India Green. Badrinath hit an unbeaten 82 and Gambhir struck 73 to propel India Red to 303 for seven after Mohammed Kaif had elected to bat. Kaifs bowlers then skittled out the Greens for 215 in 47 overs to romp home. Badrinath, who hit seven fours and a last-ball six in his 79-ball innings, staked claim for a spot in the ODI squad, while Gambhir continued to impress. Needing a shade over six runs an over, India Green got off to a disastrous start. Bengals Manoj Tiwary (65) tried his best to make a match of it, but received little support. Yousuf Pathan (0) departed in the first over off Praveen Kumar. Cheteshwara Pujara (7), the other opener, was also sent back by Praveen. When captain Parthiv Patel (19) was dismissed, India Green were 36 for three. Tiwary raised visions of a miracle, but once he was out in the 33rd over, it was all over for the Greens conceding a bonus point to India Red. Praveen Kumar claimed five wickets for 45 runs in the nine overs he bowled. Earlier, India Red, opener Gautam Gambhir provided the much needed momentum with a 74-ball 73 runs knock. However, skipper Mohammed Kaif again flopped with the bat. Munaf Patel, who has been out of the Indian side for the past several matches, gave 81 runs in his 10 overs picking one wicket in the last over of India Red innings.  (PTI)

 Lawson awaiting Pak feedback

 The turmoil in Pakistan following former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos assassination has left the countrys Australian coach Geoff Lawson in two minds on whether to return there at the end of his Christmas holidays. 
Lawson is currently in Sydney with his family to celebrate the holiday season after a gruelling tour of India and has said he is awaiting a feedback on the situation there before deciding on returning to his base in Lahore. 
Im making informal investigations with people I know in Pakistan to get their opinions. Ive sent a few emails this (Friday) morning just to people I know in Pakistan in different areas to get their opinions, Lawson was quoted in a report by Australian Associated Press. 
Im very open (to what they say) and Im more likely to take into account what theyve got to say rather than any officials. Im just seeking advice, Im not pre-judging anything, he added. 
Cricket Australia, meanwhile, have no plans to cancel the tour of Pakistan in March but will monitor the security situation there before it goes ahead. 
I dont think from our perspective much has changed, CA Chief Executive James Sutherland told reporters. 
During February well have a look at the circumstances that are relevant to the tour. 
The black arm band 
 Adam Gilchrist wore a black armband on the second day of the first Test against India on Thursday to mourn the death of Yalgoo farmer Bill Rowe, who died early on Boxing Day from injuries received in a Christmas Day beach attack in Geraldton. 
Gilchrist and his wife Mel are friends with Rowes brother Mike and his wife Mel. The Australian wicketkeeper decided to wear the armband after discussing it with Mike Rowe on Wednesday night. 
I was shocked and saddened to hear the news, quot; Gilchrist said before play on Thursday, according to a report in The Age. 
Adam Gilchrist raised $18,000 for each of his four dismissals on Thursday for the breast cancer fund-raiser McGrath Foundation. 
Racial taunts 
 Cricket Australias zero-tolerance policy notwithstanding, Australian fans racially taunted Indian supporters at the MCG on Thursday. 
According to a report in the Herald Sun, police and security staff did not eject any fans despite the Australian supporters shouting Show us your visas, show us your visas at their Indian counterparts and being within metres of the potentially explosive incident. (Agencies)

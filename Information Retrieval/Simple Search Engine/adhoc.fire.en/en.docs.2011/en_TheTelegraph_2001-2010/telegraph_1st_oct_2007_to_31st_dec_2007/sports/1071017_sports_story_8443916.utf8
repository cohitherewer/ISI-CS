 Massa deal extended
London: Ferrari have extended Brazilian Felipe Massas contract by two more years to the end of the 2010 season, the Formula One team said in a statement on Tuesday. The announcement follows recent media speculation that Spains unsettled double world champion Fernando Alonso could be lined up to join Ferrari from McLaren in 2009 as a replacement for Massa. Massa, 26, joined Ferrari at the end of 2005 from then Ferrari-powered Sauber after being first signed by the Italian team in 2001. He partnered Germanys seven-time champion Michael Schumacher last year before teaming up with Kimi Raikkonen this season. Raikkonens Ferrari deal runs to the end of 2009. The Brazilian has won three races this year but is fourth overall and out of contention for the championship which ends at his home Interlagos circuit on Sunday.  (REUTERS)

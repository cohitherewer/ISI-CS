 Md. Sporting stun East Bengal 2-1
 - Defending champions fail to overtake Mohun Bagan as leaders A STAFF REPORTER  Mohammedan Sporting captain Mir Farooq Hyder congratulates Adewusi Adebayo after he scored the teams first goal at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: A lot of football success is in the mind... You must believe that you are the best and then make sure that you are. These were Bill Shanklys words uttered decades ago but the legendary English managers observation remains the ultimate truth in the football ground even today. A number of Mohammedan Sporting players may not have heard of Shankly and how he had transformed a troubled Liverpool into a champion side in the 60s and 70s. But the way Shabbir Alis side psyched out the defending champions East Bengal in their second-phase CFL Premier Division at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday, spoke volumes of their mental integration. The 1-2 defeat is not only East Bengals first loss in the league, but the side  with 22 points from 10 matches  also missed the opportunity to overtake leaders Mohun Bagan (24 points). As the league is set to remain inactive for 21 days from Sunday, Mohammedan Sporting have shot up to the fifth place with 12 points, behind Chirag United SC and Peerless. United SC beat Peerless 3-1 in Saturdays other match. If Mohammedan Sportings display was a story of determination and dedication to come back from the wilderness, East Bengals was nothing but complacency. It could best be described by Edmilsons last-minute gamesmanship, which essentially aimed to gain a penalty. He fell to the ground theatrically inside the box, having seen V. Prem Kumar in the way, while a simple attempt to dodge past the Mohammedan Sporting defender could have opened a clear opportunity for him. Referee Rathin Mukherjee rightly waved play-on, sparking a wide protest from East Bengal players soon after the match. If East Bengal hoped Edmilsons antics would be good enough to bring up the victory, Mohammedan Sporting played with intelligence, relying more on the practical means available to them. Working as a unit, Shabbir Alis fought well within their limitations and smartly accomplished their mission. Since Adewusi Adebayo put Mohammedan Sporting ahead with a deft free-kick in the second minute, they looked determined to make the defending champions run for their money. Ali used his players cleverly from the bench. So, Tapan Giri made his debut in the black-and-white as a spoiler for Edmilson. The defensive-minded Prasanta Chakraborty replaced the creative-minded Basudeb Mondal and Roque Barreto, known to be a good passer from the deep, substituted striker Nirapada Mondal after the break. Alis tactical acumen paid dividends as the flowing nature of East Bengal midfielders found obstacles whenever they tried to make ground. With Mehtab Hussain hardly providing any bite to East Bengal attack, Alvito DCunha was introduced seconds before the first-half. Edmilson by that time found the equaliser. Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Nasim Akhtar was partially responsible for the goal in the 32nd minute as he set the wall porously against the Brazilians free-kick. The second-half was a battle between East Bengals search for a winner and Mohammedan Sportings determination to regain some pride, especially after their 2-6 and 1-3 losses they had suffered in the Premier Divisions first phase and Federation Cup, respectively. Mohammedan Sportings efforts reached fruition with 10 minutes to go, thanks to K. Kulothungans opportunism. East Bengal keeper Gopal Das parried a Roque piledriver following a corner, but Kulothungan was at the right place at the right time to snap up the rebound. As Alis boys grew in confidence, defending the lead tooth and nail, East Bengal lost the plot, looked aimless and lived in the make-belief world that Edmilsons antics would put them back on track. It never happened and Mohammedan Sporting returned the deserving winners. TEAMS Mohammedan Sporting: Nasim Akhtar; Seby Martin, Tapan Giri, Ayeni Bidemi Daniel, V.

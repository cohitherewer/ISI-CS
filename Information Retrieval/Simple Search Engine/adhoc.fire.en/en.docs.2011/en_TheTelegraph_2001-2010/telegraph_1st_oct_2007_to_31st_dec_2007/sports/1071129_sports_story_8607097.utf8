 Laxman returns to top 20
A STAFF REPORTER V.V.S. Laxman Calcutta: V.V.S. Laxman is back in the top 20 of the LG ICC player rankings for the first time in three years after an excellent knock in the first innings of the first Test against Pakistan in New Delhi. Laxman, who scored an unbeaten 72 in his teams 276, climbed two places to 20th position in the rankings for Test batsmen, according to an ICC release on Wednesday. He returned to top 20 for the first time since October 2004 when he was there during the home series against Australia. The 33-year-old now has South Africa captain Graeme Smith in 19th spot in his sights. Smiths next Test appearance will be against the West Indies in the Boxing Day Test in Port Elizabeth, which means if the Hyderabad batsman carries his good form into the next two Tests, he has every chance of overtaking the South African. Captain Anil Kumble is also rewarded for bowling his team to a six-wicket victory. Kumble, who won the Man of the Match award, jumped two places to fifth in the rankings for Test bowlers. Kumble thus narrowed the gap behind teammate and eighth-placed Irfan Pathan to four points. Wasim Jaffer and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are the India batsmen on the rise in rankings. Jaffer, who scored 32 and 53, jumped two places to 40th position  the first time he has achieved this ranking in his career  while Dhoni also improved his ranking by two places to 41st after scoring 57. Rahul Dravid is the highest-ranked Indian batsman in 11th position while Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguy are occupying 18th and 28th spots respectively. For Pakistan, the only consolation from the New Delhi Test defeat was Misbah-ul Haqs jump from 88th position to 66th spot. Misbah stood tall in an otherwise ordinary batting display by the tourists, scoring 82 and 45 in his two innings. Mohammed Yousuf maintains his fourth position but innings of 27 and 18 mean he lost 17 points. This widens the gap between him and third-placed Kumar Sangakkara to 28 points and also means that Australias Mike Hussey and Englands Kevin Pietersen are just 17 and 19 points adrift respectively. Yunus Khan, the only other Pakistan batsman in top 30, dropped one place to eighth spot while Kamran Akmal fell by four places to 34th and captain Shoaib Malik slipped six place to 51st position. Shoaib Akhtar, who had match figures of six for 102 in what was his first Test in 11 months, strengthened his position in the top 10 for bowlers by rising two places to eighth. Shoaib now has his eyes on seventh-placed Shane Bond and eighth-placed Brett Lee who are within striking distance of the Pakistan fast bowler. TEST RANKINGS BATSMEN  1.

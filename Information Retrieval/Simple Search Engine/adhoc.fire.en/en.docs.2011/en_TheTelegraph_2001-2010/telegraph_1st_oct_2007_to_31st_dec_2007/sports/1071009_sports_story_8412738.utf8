 German touch in Indias F1 circuit
Chennai: Two German architects will next week visit New Delhi to prepare a master plan for the countrys first-ever Formula One track, according to Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi. Kalmadi said although venue for the race was not finalised yet, he was confident India would host the race in next couple of years. Bringing F1 is not a simple matter but we are very confident, said Kalmadi at the prize distribution ceremony for the JK Tyres National Road Racing Championship. We have got an F1 racer in Narain Karthikeyan and now Vijay Mallya is heading an F1 team so it is a natural progression that we should have an F1 track now. We have two German architects visiting New Delhi next week to prepare a master plan for the F1 track, he said. Venues on the outskirts of Delhi  in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh  have been recently inspected by Formula One officials but so far nothing has been finalised about any particular site, Kalmadi said. We are in negotiation with the governments of both the states, he said adding we also welcome private companies. (PTI)

 Yuvraj in the dock

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
Melbourne: Yuvraj Singh is in the dock for showing dissent after being given out by Billy Bowden on Day II of the first Test. 
Yuvraj was called for a hearing by Match Referee Mike Procter on Friday evening, but the decision wont be known before Saturday. 
Im just looking into a few things... Id like to be sure I make the right decision, Procter told The Telegraph. 
Yuvraj may, eventually, be let off with a fine.

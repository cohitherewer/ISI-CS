 - Arch-rivals gear up for second Test 
 -  No re-entry passes for spectators after tea break A STAFF REPORTER Sourav Ganguly walks into the Eden for practice under the close vigil of security offcials on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: A three-tier security ring will be thrown around Eden Gardens to prevent any untoward incident from occurring during the second Test between India and Pakistan beginning on Friday. In an unprecedented move, the city police have decided that spectators who decide to leave the stadium during the tea break will not be allowed back inside. For security reasons, re-entry passes will be given only during the lunch break. Since the tea break is only for 20 minutes, it wont be possible for a person to enter again after going through the required security measures, city Police Commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said at a press conference on Wednesday. What we call Access Control will be in place This means a person will have to go through a three-tier security ring before entering the Eden. We are therefore requesting all concerned to enter at least an hour before the start. Modern electronic gadgets will be in place in and around the stadium. These have never been used before in a sporting event in the city. Hidden cameras will be around Every individual will be photographed, screened and frisked before entry, Chakrabarti said. He did not give any details on what the modern electronic gadgets were. While spectators will be allowed to carry cell phones, Chakrabarti said mobile communication will get affected because of the equipment. He also said that no one would be allowed inside the stadium with bags. No bags can be carried inside. Water bottles and food will also be not allowed, Chakrabarti said. Over 5,000 policemen, a number never used before according to Chakrabarti, will be on duty. There will also be plainclothes policemen all around. We are stressing on quality, though he said. Chakrabarti said he had discussed details of the arrangements with his predecessor and CAB president Prasun Mukherjee. The police were still trying to locate the source of the email that threatened to disrupt the Test a few days back. Special arrangements will also be in place for the 250-odd Pakistan spectators who are expected at the Eden during the match.

				 																																																	 Railway FC emerged champions in the Super Division to make the Premier Division. On Wednesday, Railway FC rode on a Sankha Roy Chowdhury brace to get the better of Calcutta Customs. The winners finished with 34 points from 16 outings. Railway got relegated only the last season.				 																																																	 Local clubs can now heave a sigh of relief. The IFA has now initiated a move clearing the deck for the clubs to replace two foreign recruits midway the season.

SNOOKER: One-frame handicap meet at the Outram Club. Matches from 5pm.

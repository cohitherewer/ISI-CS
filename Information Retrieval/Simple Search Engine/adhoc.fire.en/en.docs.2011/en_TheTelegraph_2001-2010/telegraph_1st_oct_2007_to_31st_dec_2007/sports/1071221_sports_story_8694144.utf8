Galle: Chaminda Vaas claimed four for 28 as England were bowled out for 81, their lowest total against the hosts, in just 30.5 overs in the third and final Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday. 
England finished the day in disarray after being asked to follow on, reaching the close on 2-0 and still trailing by 416 runs with two days left in the game. 
Englands pathetic 81 fell below their previous low of 148 against Sri Lanka in Colombo on the previous tour in 2003. 
The tourists, who are 1-0 down in the series, will resume with both Michael Vaughan and Alastair Cook on one not out. 
Sri Lanka had earlier piled up 499 for eight declared with Mahela Jayawardene extending his overnight score to 213 not out. 
England lost the wickets of Michael Vaughan (one), Ian Bell (one), Alastair Cook (13) and Kevin Pietersen (one) during a calamitous 40-minute session before lunch. 
Vaughan was trapped lbw as he padded-up to a big in-swinger from Chaminda Vaas and Bell was brilliantly run out by a direct hit from Tillekeratne Dilshan. 
Vaas then found the outside edge of Cook, who felt for an outswinger, and Lasith Malinga produced a brutish short delivery to have Pietersen caught behind taking evasive action. 
Wickets tumbled again straight the break with Ravi Bopara (nought) chipping a catch to mid on and Matthew Prior being clean bowled by a Vaas delivery that kept low. 
The tourists were steadied by Paul Colingwood (29) and Ryan Sidebottom (11) who added 37 for the seventh wicket. 
Play was interrupted during the mid-afternoon due to a tropical downpour, but Englands collapse continued when play resumed late in the evening, losing their last four wickets for 11 runs. 
Off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan started the final slide as Sidebottom was snapped up at bat pad. 
Earlier, Jayawardene had extended his overnight score of 149  a record 21st century for Sri Lanka  to reach his fourth double hundred. 
Jayawardenes remarkable innings  on a pitch that has been helpful for the bowlers throughout the first three days  lasted 10 hours and 13 minutes, spanning 411 deliveries and including 25 boundaries. 
Ja-yawardene was supported by Vaas, who scored 90 from 133 deliveries during partnership that added 183 runs for the seventh wicket  a Sri Lanka record against England.

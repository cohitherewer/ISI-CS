 Murray, Nadal clear the air
MARK HODGKINSON Rafael Nadal after being felicitated by the mayor of Madrid on Monday. (Reuters) Andy Murray has a possible third-round meeting with Rafael Nadal, the world No. 2, at this weeks Madrid Masters and on Sunday had a brief chat with the Spaniard, in which they discussed the Scots remarks about players being offered money to throw matches. On learning that Murray had last week suggested matches had been fixed and that everyone knows that its going on, Nadal had indicated that the British No. 1 had gone overboard, saying he had seen no evidence of corruption. Murray on Sunday told Nadal his words had been taken out of context, saying he did not mean that players knew matches had been fixed but that everyone had been aware of reports that players had rejected bribes. Murray put out a statement clarifying his remarks last week, but still wanted to talk to Nadal about the matter. I just spoke to Rafa five minutes ago and we were joking about it, said Murray, who plays Czech Radek Stepanek in the opening round. I explained the whole situation to him. He understands. He has been around the press for a long time and its easy for them to change words and not report the questions youve been asked and just put the answers in. Rafa thought that maybe I was annoyed with him because he had called me stupid. Hes fine. Murray added that the controversy had not been a distraction, saying: No, not really. I know what I said and Ive spoken to a couple of players about it and I dont think what I said is as big an issue as has been made out. It was taken out of context. I never once said that players fixed matches or that players were directly involved in betting on matches. I did say there was a lot of betting in tennis and everyone in tennis knows that betting is going up. Three or four of the players have said that they have been offered money. I definitely said that stuff goes on. I dont think that tennis matches have been fixed. I never said that. The 20-year-old will have a meeting on Tuesday with officials from the ATP, which is also mulling over whether to call on the services of Lord Condon, the former Metropolitan police commissioner who led the probe into match-fixing and corruption in cricket. I think its great theyre setting up an anti-corruption unit, Murray said.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 India colts shock Saudis 3-0 
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: India pulled off a stunning 3-0 victory over hosts Saudi Arabia at the AFC Under-16 Championship in Damman on Sunday night. India has 10 points from four matches and are now almost sure of a berth in the final round for the first time since 2002. A draw against lowly Bhutan on Wednesday would ensure Indias place in the last 16. India is second in group C behind Iraq on goal difference. Saudi Arabia has nine points. It was an unbelievable result, said goalkeepers coach Tanumoy Bose from Damman. The team has been playing well, but we did not expect to win so convincingly. India beat Sri Lanka 6-0 in the opener, followed by a 2-2 draw against Iraq and a 3-0 win over Lebanon. Indian expatriates thronged the Prince Mohammed Bin Fahad Stadium on Sunday to cheer the team on. So impressed are they by the teams performance that they also planning to felicitate the players. Striker Malsawmfela, a former Mohun Bagan-SAIL Academy student, starred with two goals in the 42nd and 50th minutes. Ralte Lalrindika scored the third in the 65th. All India Football Federation general secretary Alberto Colaco said the team would be kept together till the finals that are to be played in September/October next year. Our technical director, Collin Toal, has also made similar recommendations. We might start working with the boys from early next year.

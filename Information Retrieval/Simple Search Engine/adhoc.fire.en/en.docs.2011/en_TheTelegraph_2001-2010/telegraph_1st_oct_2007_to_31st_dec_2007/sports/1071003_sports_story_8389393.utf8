 ICC clarifies free-hit rule in ODIs
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed on Tuesday that the free hit in ODIs applies to all foot-fault no-balls and not just front-foot ones. According to information received here, a free hit will apply to the next delivery after a bowler either oversteps with his front foot or if his back foot cuts or does not land within the return crease. For any free hit, the striker can be dismissed only under the circumstances that apply for a no-ball, even if the delivery for the free hit is called wide. Field changes are not permitted for free hit deliveries unless there is a change of striker. The umpires will signal a free hit by (after the normal no-ball signal) extending one arm straight upwards and moving it in a circular motion. The change was first adopted in the abandoned ODI India and Australia in Bangalore.

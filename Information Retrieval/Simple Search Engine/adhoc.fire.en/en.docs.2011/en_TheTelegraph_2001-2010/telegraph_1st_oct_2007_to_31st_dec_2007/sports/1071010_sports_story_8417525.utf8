 PCB seeks legal advice on Koertzen
Lahore: The PCB has asked its legal advisors to find out if South African umpire Rudi Koertzen had breached any ICC Code of Conduct by allegedly describing the Pakistani players as cheats. PCB Chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf is in London to discuss the issue with the ICC and confirm if Koertzen had indeed made such remarks about the Pakistani cricketers. Australian umpire Darrell Hair, who is fighting a legal battle with the ICC at a central employment tribunal in London over his reinstatement for Test and international matches, has said at the hearing that Koertzen in a telephone conversation called the Pakistanis cheats. Hair claimed that Koertzen had in March expressed his pleasure at Pakistan being knocked out of the World Cup after losing to Ireland. Hair has said that Koertzen after exchanging pleasantries on the phone said: thats great news, those cheats can now go home. The call was made from the phone of Doug Cowie. A senior PCB official said that Ashraf had gone to London for the tribunal proceedings and to talk to the ICC and related people to find out about the statement made by Hair about Koertzen. (PTI)

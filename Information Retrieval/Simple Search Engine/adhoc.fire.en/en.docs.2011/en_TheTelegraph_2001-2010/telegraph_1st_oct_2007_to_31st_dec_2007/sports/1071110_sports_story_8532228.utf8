 Hill fears political bias
Kevin Garside Damon Hill Damon Hill, Britains former world champion, expressed his concerns for Formula One after the latest bout of spy fever. Hill believes another espionage trial could further expose a tawdry political underbelly and see people lose faith in Formula One. He has reservations about the way the Ferrari spygate case against McLaren was prosecuted by F1s regulatory body, the FIA, and points to a lack of consistency in the dispensing of justice as a particular area of concern. I would like to understand how the Ferrari-Toyota case [former Ferrari engineers in the employ of Toyota guilty of industrial espionage], which ended in court, did not lead to the same outcome as the Ferrari-McLaren case? Why was there no punishment of the team [Toyota]? Hill said. There was an uncomfortable feeling that there was something more to the McLaren outcome than the issue being investigated. The way that justice was meted out raised some questions about the way the FIA handle these breaches. If breaches occur then those things should be investigated and dealt with sensibly and appropriately. But in that case there were lots of questions about what really happened that went unanswered. There is a long-held view in Formula One that Ferrari are treated as a special case. They are the sports most powerful brand, hugely influential economically and politically. A measure of Ferraris importance can be seen in the way F1 commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone targeted a deal with Ferrari in 2005 to divide the manufacturers group ranged against him, to which they belonged, in the dispute over the distribution of money. Many believe that this influence is reflected in the way sporting disputes are settled by the authorities. Why, asked Hill, were Ferrari just given a slap on the wrist and told not to do it again after winning the first race with a device [a flexible floor] that was illegal? This brings about a lot of the problems relating to justice and consistency. In this country we are quite sophisticated sport and political spectators. If things dont stack up, and continue to fly in the face of what we regard as being just and fair, then the danger is people will just walk away. Its a problem that has existed for a long time in this sport, not knowing whether to believe things or not. Im not a lone voice here. There are a lot of people who love this sport and have got a lot out of it, who want it to be a healthy sport and to attract people to it. When there are episodes like we had in the last season our hearts sink because we think that theyre not doing it any good. Last season was the best in F1 for a long time, most notably because there were four drivers who could have been world champion. That brought about a massive amount of interest in the sport for the right reasons. It did not need any more controversy or sideshows.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Milan, Chelsea in knockout stage
 Fernando Torres exults after Liverpools win over Porto on Wednesday. (AFP) Milan: Holders AC Milan and Chelsea reached the Champions League knockout stages on Wednesday but Valencia bowed out after a 0-0 draw with Schalke. Real Madrid still have work to do after losing 3-2 at Werder Bremen with Group C now wide open after Olympiakos won 2-1 at Lazio, who could still qualify despite being bottom. Last seasons beaten finalists Liverpool continued their revival with a 4-1 home win over Porto with Fernando Torres scoring his first two Champions League goals while Besiktas beating Marseille 2-1 also boosted the English side in Group A and kept the Turks in the hunt. Massimo Donatis stoppage-time goal secured a 2-1 win for Celtic over Shakhtar Donetsk which leaves the Scottish champions needing just a point next week in Milan, with the holders already through after a 1-1 draw at now eliminated Benfica. Andrea Pirlo put Milan ahead with a superb strike after a quarter of an hour and although Maxi Pereira levelled matters soon after Milan held on to amass 10 points in Group D, one ahead of Celtic and four ahead of Shakhtar. The Ukraine side, who took an early lead in Glasgow through Brandao before Jiri Jarosiks equaliser on halftime, must beat Benfica at home and hope Milan do them favour despite being through. Werder hung on for the win against Real after going ahead on five minutes through Markus Rosenberg. Robinho levelled but fine goals from Boubacar Sanogo and Aaron Hunt either side of the break put Werder clear before Ruud van Nistelrooy struck with 20 minutes to go. Chelsea will top group B after overwhelming Rosenborg 4-0 with two first half goals from powerhouse forward Didier Drogba and a free kick five minutes before the break from defender Alex. Joe Cole scored in the second period. (Reuters)

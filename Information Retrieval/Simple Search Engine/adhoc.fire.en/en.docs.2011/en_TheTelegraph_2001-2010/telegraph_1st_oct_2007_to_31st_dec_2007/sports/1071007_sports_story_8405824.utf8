 Sourav works out at nets
Chandigarh: Sourav Ganguly and Robin Uthappa practised for half-an-hour at the Sector 16 Stadium after the Indian team arrived here on Saturday for the fourth ODI against Australia. Even though both the teams reached the hotel late in the afternoon, both Sourav and Uthappa took time off in the evening for practice. Team manager Lalchand Rajput bowled to Sourav, while a local bowler helped Uthappa. Bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad was also present at the ground. Sunday, both the teams will have an extended nets session at the stadium, which is hosting a match after a gap of 14 years. Late in the evening, Chandigarh-based star batsman Yuvraj Singh took time off to attend a function along with his father Yograj Singh at DAV School in Sector 8 here.  (PTI)

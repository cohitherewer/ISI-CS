 Schumi rues not being with team in Brazil
Berlin: Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher congratulated Kimi Raikkonen for claiming the Formula One drivers crown in Brazil, saying he had never expected such a dramatic finish. Raikkonen won the 2007 championship after finishing first ahead of Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa at Interlagos on Sunday. I congratulate Kimi and the whole team for this superb performance, Schumacher told his internet site. Its a pity I was not there to celebrate the title with the whole team, added the driver who retired at the end of 2006. This last race was incredible, passionate and with an unlikely scenario. I always thought you have to believe in your chances right till the end even if they are very small. But nobody really believed there would be an end to the championship like this.  (AFP)

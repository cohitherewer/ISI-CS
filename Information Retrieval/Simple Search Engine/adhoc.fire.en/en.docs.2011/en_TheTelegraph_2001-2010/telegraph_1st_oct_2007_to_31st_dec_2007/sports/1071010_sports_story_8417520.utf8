 Rest are the best
 Ishant Sharma took three for 31 Rajkot: Paceman Munaf Patels devastating five-wicket haul propelled Rest of India to a nine wicket victory over Ranji champions Mumbai on the penultimate day of their Irani Trophy encounter here on Tuesday. Chasing a small target of 88 runs, Rest of India needed just 18.5 overs. The match was over even before the lunch break with a day and more than two sessions to spare. Earlier, resuming at 98 for six, the remaining Mumbai batsmen caved in against fiery spells from Munaf and Ishant Sharma. They were bundled out for just 106. Munaf, who was struggling to get his rhythm in first innings, came back with a vengeance in the second essay to finish with five for 25. Opener Wasim Jaffer, who was unbeaten overnight, misread Munafs swing to be bowled while the last three batsmen  Iqbal Abdullah, Omkar Guruv and Rajesh Verma failed to open their accounts. Ajit Agarkar remained unbeaten on 11. In fact, Munaf and Ishant took just 2.3 overs on Tuesday morning to take the last four wickets, sharing two each. Ishant finished with impressive figures of three for 31. Mumbai had conceded a first inning lead of 19 runs. Rest of India achieved the target by losing only Aakash Chopra (7). Parthiv Patel, the centurion in the first innings, was unbeaten on 60 off just 49 balls with 10 fours while captain Mohammed Kaif remained unbeaten on 22 (46b, 4x4).  (PTI)

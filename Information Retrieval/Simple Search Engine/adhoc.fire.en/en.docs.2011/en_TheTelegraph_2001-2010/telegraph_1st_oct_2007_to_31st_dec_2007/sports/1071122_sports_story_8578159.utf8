 Real plan 30m bid for Drogba
STEVE WILSON Didier Drogba Real Madrid have been alerted to Didier Drogbas growing dissatisfaction at Chelsea and are preparing a 30 million bid to take him to the Bernabeu next summer. The Ivory Coast striker has upset Chelseas hierarchy by expressing a desire to be involved in his countrys 2008 Beijing Olympic campaign, the announcement coming only weeks before he is due to miss a month of the season on African Nations Cup duty. Involvement in the Olympics would take Drogba out of most of Chelseas pre-season and, with the final on August 23, potentially the first few weeks of next season. National team manager Gerard Gili has said that he wants to assemble his squad at the first available opportunity for a Nations Cup tournament that runs from January 20 to February 20, meaning Drogba is likely to miss five Premier League matches, the start of the Champions League knock-out stages and potential FA Cup and Carling Cup games. When taken in isolation a desire to represent his country would not be held against the powerful forward but comments in the wake of Jose Mourinhos departure have strained relations at Stamford Bridge. Drogba, who was exceptionally close to the Portuguese and reportedly cried when his former manager broke the news of his departure, referred to the club as being broken and in a subsequent interview spoke of how his decision to join Chelsea from Marseille had left him disgusted. Chelsea, despite Avram Grant attempting to make peace with Drogba and another player still disgruntled by this seasons upheavals at the club, are resigned to the fact that Drogba wants to leave and would be happy to listen to offers from any continental clubs. At 29-years-old Drogba is at the peak of his form but recouping the 24 million that was spent on him, and even making a profit, would be considered good business by the club. Reports in an English daily also suggest that Chelsea are already planning for Drogbas leaving and are pursuing Boltons Nicolas Anelka.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

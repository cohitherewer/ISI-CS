 Advantage Pak in second leg
Islamabad: After conceding the first leg, Pakistan players retaliated by getting the better of Indian duo Ashutosh Singh and Vivek Shokeen in doubles and take a 1-0 lead in the second leg of the tennis series here on Thursday. The Pakistani pair of Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi and Aqeel Khan defeated the visitors 7-5, 7-6 in a clay court match. As the players were exhausted after playing the doubles, the Pakistan Tennis Federation rescheduled the matches and now both singles would be played on Friday. The Indian duo have a tough task ahead as they have to win both matches to claim the series. The first leg in Lahore, which India clinched 2-1, was played on grass. (PTI)

 Kirsten is here to get familiar

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
 Gary Kirsten checks into a Bangalore hotel on Friday 
Bangalore: It could be called the tale of two South Africans. 
Six months ago, Graham Ford avoided the media after being offered the Team India coachs job. On Friday evening, Gary Kirsten didnt mind taking the odd question on his first trip to India as coach. 
Of course, Im excited and why not? Its good to be back in India, Kirsten told The Telegraph as he checked in at the Grand Ashok. 
Kirsten, a former stand-in captain, didnt show signs of jet lag. I had a comfortable journey from Joburg to Dubai and, then, on to here, he said as the hotels security staff escorted him to the elevator. 
At the airport, Kirsten emphasised that hed made the trip to make himself familiar with the cricket culture and hadnt come with a plan which had to be implemented straightaway. 
Indeed, Kirsten will only be taking charge from March 1. Till then, hes going to act more as a consultant. 
Kirsten timed his arrival rather well: Around an hour or so before the team left for dinner hosted by Test captain Anil Kumble. 
That informal setting allowed Greg Chappells full-time successor to interact with the ones hell soon be working with closely. 
Kirsten, by the way, acknowledged that the pressure in these parts was immense. Its not just on the players, mind you. 
As of now, Kirsten is going to be in Bangalore throughout the third and final Test against Pakistan, which begins on Saturday.

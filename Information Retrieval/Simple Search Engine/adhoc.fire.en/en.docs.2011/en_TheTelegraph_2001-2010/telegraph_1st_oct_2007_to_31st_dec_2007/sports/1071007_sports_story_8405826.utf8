				 Wada rues Shoaib, Asif let-off						
	New Delhi: The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) Saturday rued International Cricket Council rsquo;s late tie-up with Wada, saying the laxity had resulted in two ldquo;drug cheats rdquo; walking away scot-free.						
	Wada director general David Howman said they were not impressed with the ICC rsquo;s handling of the doping fiasco involving pace duo Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, who had tested positive for banned drug nandrolone in an internal test conducted by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) before the Champions Trophy last year.						
	 ldquo;We were not happy with the manner in which the issue was dealt with but could do nothing about it, rdquo; Howman said referring to PCB appellate tribunal revoking the bans on the bowlers despite the two admitting that they had taken the banned substance ldquo;unknowingly. rdquo;						ICC defends Hair demotion

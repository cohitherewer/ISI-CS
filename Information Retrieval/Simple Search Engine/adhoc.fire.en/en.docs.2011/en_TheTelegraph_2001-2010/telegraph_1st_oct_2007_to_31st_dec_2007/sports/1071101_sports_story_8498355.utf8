 Santoro derails Djokovic

(AP) Paris: Frenchman Fabrice Santoro thrilled the home crowd by crushing world number three Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-2 in the second round of the Paris Masters on Wednesday. Djokovic, a revelation this season with five titles and a final appearance at the U.S. Open, was a shadow of his brilliant best. World number two Rafael Nadal, making his debut at the $2.45 million indoor event, had no such problems. The Spaniard recovered from a break down to outclass Italian Filippo Volandri 6-3, 6-1 and set up a third-round match against Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka. Im happy with my serve, the Spaniard said. I made some mistakes at the start, but after that I played very well. Paris is a very big tournament and I am going to try to play my best here, Nadal said. If I play a good tournament here I am going to arrive (in) Shanghai with more confidence. Russias Nikolay Davydenko, who won the tournament last year and is seeded fourth, overcame a sluggish start to move past Argentine qualifier Juan Martin Del Potro 7-6, 6-1. Its not really 100 per cent, Davydenko said. Im really scared. You cannot practice very well and you cannot prepare for the tournament, he added. Djokovic, who entered the Bercy hall wearing a Zorro mask which he took off when the match started, made a string of unforced errors. Its been a very long season and Im really exhausted, said the 20-year-old Serb. I hope people will understand. You cant be at 100 per cent all the time. I wasnt moving well. Santoro took over the control. I was having all the unforced errors and making free points for him. Unfortunately I couldnt give my 100 per cent  not even 30 percent. Santoro, who has a reputation for upsetting big names and had knocked out world number five Andy Roddick last week in Lyon, double-faulted on his first match point but made amends with a backhand volley on the second to seal victory after 69 minutes. The resilient 34-year-old next faces British number one Andy Murray, who had earlier stayed on course for a Masters Cup berth by beating Finn Jarkko Nieminen 7-6, 6-3. The 20-year-old Scot, who won his third career title on Sunday in Russia, is one of several players fighting for the two remaining spots at the November 11-18 season-finale in Shanghai featuring the worlds top eight. Murray took the first-set tiebreak 7-5 when Nieminen hit a backhand into the net. Nieminen broke serve in the fourth game of the second set but the Briton hit back immediately before capturing the Finns serve again in the seventh game. Murray, who escaped unhurt from a car accident in Paris on Monday, stayed in control until Nieminen bowed out with an unforced error on the second match point. Santoro is my favourite player to watch, Murray said. You wont see a game style like his probably for the rest of my career. Hes just a completely different player, plays some unbelievable shots.

 2 injured in Indias win
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Two key players in the India team are set to return home from Dubai after they were injured during the soccer friendly against local side Al Nasr on Monday night. According to reports reaching here, goalkeeper Sandip Nandy and striker Abhishek Yadav were injured during Indias 2-1 victory. While Nandy pulled his hamstring, Yadav suffered a head injury. According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, both footballers may be sent home in a day or two. Coach Bob Houghton feels that taking the two footballers to Lebanon for the World Cup qualifier would be a futile exercise since none of them are likely to get fit before October 8, said an official. Of the 23 players in the squad, only 18 can be registered for the match. In the absence of Yadav, Manjit Singh is likely to get the nod. On Monday, backed by a couple of thousand Indian expatriates, India dished out a fine game. Playing their first match since the triumphant Nehru Cup final against Syria, India trailed by a goal before scoring twice through NP Pradeep and Manjit. India will practice a few more days in Dubai before leaving for Beirut on October 6.

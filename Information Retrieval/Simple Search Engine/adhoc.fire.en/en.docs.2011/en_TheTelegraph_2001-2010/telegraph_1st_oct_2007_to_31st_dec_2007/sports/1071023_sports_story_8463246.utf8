 Ex-coach for Clarke
Melbourne: Former Australia coach John Buchanan on Monday backed Michael Clarke as the future captain of the world champion side. Buchanan said Clarke should be given the opportunity to perform the role of a captain in domestic games, which would prepare him for a similar job at the international stage. As I look at it, Michael Clarke is the person who should be groomed for the Australian captaincy. We actually need to see him in that role. That might mean he should captain his state side or take more of a leadership position within the Australian team, Buchanan was quoted in a daily. If Cricket Australia accepts Buchanans advice, then the 26-year-old Clarke may replace Simon Katich as the New South Wales skipper. Michael needs to be given roles in terms of captaincy or vice-captaincy in certain tours and see how he handles them. Adam Gilchrist has mentioned a couple of times that he may not choose to play one-day cricket for long and if that is the case, then Clarke should be given the vice-captains role, Buchanan added.

 Pak save Test, not series 
 - Inzamam misses Miandad mark, breaks bat in frustration
 - Kallis named Man of the Series  Younis Khan celebrates his century against South Africa  his second of the series and 14th overall  in Lahore on Friday. Younis made 130. (AFP) Lahore: South Africa secured only their second series win in 10 years in Pakistan on Friday after the second and final Test ended in a draw at the Gaddafi Stadium. The South Africans, who won the first Test in Karachi by 160 runs, settled for the draw after Younis Khan (130), Kamran Akmal (71) and Mohammed Yousuf (63 not out) guided Pakistan to 316 for four at the close. We controlled nine out of 10 days of Test cricket in this series. We bowled very well and kept Pakistan under pressure from the word go. We are over the moon with this series win, South African skipper Graeme Smith said. It is not easy to win in the subcontinent but we have put in a very good team effort. Pakistan, set an improbable victory target of 457, were boosted by his second century of the series by Younis who batted for 246 balls and hit 16 fours before he was out after lunch. The day also featured the final Test innings of Inzamam-ul Haq who fell for just three runs to end his career with 8,830 runs including 25 centuries from 120 matches. Inzamam had required just six runs to become Pakistans highest run-getter in Tests. Inzamam played his first shot to mid-wicket for three but was out second ball when he jumped down the wicket to Harris and was stumped. The former Pakistan captain smashed his bat in frustration after falling agonisingly short of Javed Miandads Pakistan Test runs record in his final international appearance. Inzamam shrugged in disgust before trudging back to the pavilion for the last time amidst applause by 5,000 home fans and a guard of honour. The master batsman later broke his bat in the dressing room in a fit of anger. Miandad, thus, remains Pakistans highest scorer with 8832 runs in 124 Tests. Yousuf scored his 28th career fifty after he missed the first Test due to lack of match fitness. Kallis was named Man of the Series for his 421 runs that included three hundreds and a fifty.

 Counselling a must for Shoaib: PCB
 Shoaib Akhtar Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board on Friday said it was compulsory for the temperamental fast bowler to undergo counselling as part of his rehabilitation process. The 13-match ban and fine is the maximum we could impose on him for his violation of the code of conduct. But it is also compulsory for him to have some sort of counselling in this period, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf told reporters. Pakistans team manager Talat Ali had recommended to the board that Shoaib required counselling to overcome his problems which have seen him get into trouble with authorities since his debut in 1997. The probation period is meant to tell him he has to now improve, and if during this period he is again involved in any violation of the team code of conduct or indiscipline, he will face an automatic life ban, Ashraf said. He said Shoaibs behaviour had disappointed him a lot as it damaged the image of Pakistan cricket. But he has realised his mistake and regretted his actions to the disciplinary committee, team and the board. So we want to move on. But we expect him to be very careful about his behaviour. The boards disciplinary committee on Thursday imposed a 13-match ban and 3.4 million rupees ($56,000) fine on Shoaib for four misconduct charges, including hitting team mate Mohammed Asif with a bat before the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. Shoaib will be eligible to play in the fifth and final ODI against South Africa on October 29, the PCB said. Shafqat Naghmi, the PCBs chief operating officer, clarified that the ban period had started the day after the incident on September 7 when team manager Talat Ali sent Shoaib home. Since his ban period started immediately it covers seven matches of the World Twenty20 and also the two Tests against South Africa, he said. The Pakistan players touring India next month will have their interaction with the media closely monitored by the team management and the board. (Agencies)

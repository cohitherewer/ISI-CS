 Selectors on terrace, not in dressing room
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar (right) and colleague Bhupinder Singh watch the proceedings in Guwahati on Monday. (AP) Guwahati: In a departure from recent practice, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar and colleague Bhupinder Singh didnt sit in the vicinity of the Team India dressing room during ODI No.1 against Pakistan. That the Board of Control for Cricket in India would finally discourage the quintet  Venkatapathi Raju, Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal being the other selectors  from doing so was reported by The Telegraph on October 31. For the first hour, Vengsarkar and Singh (the only two on duty here) sat adjacent to the dressing room and, then, were moved to the terrace of the pavilion building. Its not confirmed, but the International Cricket Council probably raised an objection as the dressing room area is meant exclusively for the players and the support staff. Incidentally, theres constant monitoring by the world bodys Anti-Corruption and Security Unit. Also, there was talk that the players just werent comfortable with the Vengsarkars around all the time.

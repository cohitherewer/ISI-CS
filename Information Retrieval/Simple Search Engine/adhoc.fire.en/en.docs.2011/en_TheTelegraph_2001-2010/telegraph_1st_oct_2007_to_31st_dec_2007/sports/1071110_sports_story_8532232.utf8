 Jyoti slips to tied 31st, Ghei 37th
 Kevin Stadler in Shanghai on Friday Shanghai: All Jyoti Randhawa needed  after a sedate opening round  was yet another solid show to hang around for a top finish but the Indian stuttered to two-over 74 to slide to tied 31st after the halfway stage at the $5 million HSBC Champions here on Friday. Compatriot Gaurav Ghei, who shared the 22nd place with Randhawa overnight, did worse and his second-round card of three-over 75 pushed him down to tied 37th, even though the veteran Indian can take heart from the august company of K.J. Choi and Sergio Garcia, all having totalled one-over 145. The shot Ghei picked up in the seventh hole was the lone highlight of a round that saw him dropping a shot each in the fifth and 11th holes besides the double bogey in the par-four ninth. Randhawa fired a birdie in each nine but could not prevent bogeys in the fifth, seventh 12th and 15th holes to settle for a two-day total of even-par 144 and join the group of six, which includes Lee Westwood, who carded an identical 74 on Friday. Laidback American Kevin Stadler recorded a steady three-under-par 69 to storm into a four-stroke lead early in the second round. Stadlers eagle three at the 16th was a small reminder of Thursdays fireworks, when the 27-year-old American and Swedens Niclas Fasth both matched the course record with rounds of 64, but a brace of bogeys kept the chasing pack in touch. Three-time major winner Phil Mickelson closed the gap with birdies on the last three holes for a bogey free 66 at the Sheshan International Golf Club. Asian tour regular Simon Yates of Scotland blasted a similar score as he leaped up to tied third position alongside Englishman Ross Fisher who carded a 68. Fijian stalwart Vijai Singh posted a 70, four strokes off the pace together with South African Andrew McLardy who recorded a 69 in joint fifth place.  (AGENCIES)

 Pele backs FAs 2018 Cup bid 
Jeremy Cross  Pele at Sheffield Uniteds home ground on Wednesday Englands hopes of hosting the World Cup in 2018 received a significant and timely boost last night when Pele, one of the most respected and influential figures in the game, offered his backing to any bid by the Football Association. FA chief executive Brian Barwick is keen for the World Cup to return to these shores for the first time since 1966. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has publicly supported the possibility of footballs showpiece event being hosted in England in 11 years time and has appointed former sports minister Richard Caborn as his World Cup ambassador. The campaign gathered further pace on Wednesday when Pele, arguably the greatest player the game has seen, insisted he would like to see the tournament return to England. Under current Fifa guidelines, the tournament is scheduled to rotate between the worlds major footballing continents. Fifa president Sepp Blatter, however, said last week the system was less than perfect, prompting a potential change in policy from the games world governing body and encouraging Barwick and his colleagues at Soho Square to consider making a serious move in an attempt to make amends for their failed bid to host the tournament in 2006. Pele said: I would love to see the World Cup held here in England again. It has been a long time since the last one here in 1966. This is a good opportunity for England. You must fight for what you want to happen. Of course, it is a big question, but why not? It will be a tough fight, but all of England wants the World Cup to come back. It was a long time ago when I played in it here in England, but England is the capital of football and it would be fantastic if it came back here. The backing of such a powerful voice will be music to the ears of Barwick, not least because the Brazilian great may be able to secure votes for Englands bid from South American nations. Pele, however, admitted Englands chances might be hampered by the fact that European neighbours Germany hosted the tournament only last year, adding: When you consider 32 countries are involved, then it is very complicated It could be too close, that could be the problem.

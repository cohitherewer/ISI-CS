 Race is still very open: Hamilton
Sao Paulo: Three title contenders. One race to go. One of the most thrilling and wild Formula One championships in decades comes down to the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday. Rookie sensation Lewis Hamilton, two-time champion Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen are vying for the title in a season marked by many twists and turns from the beginning. Hamilton, trying to become the first rookie to win the title and the youngest champion ever, has a four-point lead over McLaren teammate Alonso, and a seven-point advantage over Ferraris Raikkonen. Whilst I might be ahead by four points, this championship is still very open, Hamilton said. I will do what I can to score the points I need, and the rest is out of our hands. The last time three drivers entered the final race with chances of winning the championship was in 1986, when Prost edged Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet. Although Hamilton has the lead, Alonso may be the one in the most comfortable position for the race at the Interlagos circuit. The Spaniard clinched both of his titles at the Brazilian GP, winning the 2005 race and finishing second last year. Hamilton, on the other hand, has never raced at Interlagos. (AP)

 Racing norms take a beating 
 STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Excepting trainer Daniel Davids less-fancied winner, Elegant Road, the course-favourites were in total command in Saturdays six-event card which was, however, reduced to five. It happened after the RCTC stewards declared the Jujube Handicap null and void. They ordered an enquiry into the running of the race and the possible reason for doing so could be a false-start. However, stewards decided against announcing any reason for an enquiry, leaving turfites to draw their own conclusions. In fact, all racing norms were overlooked. Even the official results were not announced after trainer Dipak Karkis Grand Ceremony managed to beat Way To The Stars and Arrayal.				 										Agreed that the stewards enquiry was a foregone conclusion for those who watched the race minutely but what about the gullible punters and those who backed the winner. They had the right to information. Yes, the course-favourite Sea Legend was observed to be galloping riderless after the starter released the lever. 				 										The afternoon was otherwise ruled by trainers Daniel David and Vijay Singh. Vijays tally included Afforce (Islam-up), who won the Access All Areas Cup.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

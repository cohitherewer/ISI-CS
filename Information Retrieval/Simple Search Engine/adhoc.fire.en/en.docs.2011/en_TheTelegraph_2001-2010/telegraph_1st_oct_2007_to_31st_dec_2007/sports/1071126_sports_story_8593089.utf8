 Scrappy EB begin on a winning note
A STAFF REPORTER Scorers Edmilson Marques and Alvito DCunha after East Bengals win over Viva Kerala at the Barasat stadium on Sunday. Picture by Gautam Bose Calcutta: East Bengal got off to a winning start in the ONGC I-League at Barasat stadium on Sunday. The local giants won 2-0 against Viva Kerala with Edmilson Marques and captain Alvito DCunha scoring in the 74th and 80th minutes, respectively. The scoreline may suggest that East Bengal won the match quite comfortably, but that wasnt the case. The former National League champions were never in control of proceedings and could have lost had the visitors not squandered a few golden opportunities. Foreign recruits Baba Tunde and Abbey Wisdom constantly kept the East Bengal defenders on their toes. Had Majek Bolaji and Syed Rahim Nabi not come to their aid, it could have meant disaster for Subrata Bhattacharyas boys. Jayanta Sen played a stellar role in the midfield while the others were reduced to mere spectators. Jayanta, doing all the hard work, was former champions lifeline and was rightly adjudged Man of the Match. The biggest disappointment was their foreign recruit McDonald Mukansi. The South African failed miserably and his replacement Ashim Biswas, coming on in the 65th minute, impressed with his deceptive speed and sharp floaters. Biswass introduction changed the whole complexion of the match. East Bengal were 1-0 up within nine minutes of his taking the field. Crosses from the wings confused the Viva Kerala defenders. The first cross was from the left, which an advancing Edmilson tapped home. Alvito doubled the margin in the 80th minute with a 25-yard volley. There was no let-up in the East Bengal offensive as they gave the rival defenders very little time to settle down. East Bengal could have got their third goal had Edmilsons lob not missed the framework by the proverbial whisker in the 82nd minute. The match at Barasat stadium, which hosted its first floodlit match, went without a hitch until the start of the second half. The start of the second half was delayed by 20 minutes after the floodlights went off. TEAMS East Bengal: Abhra Mondal, I. Surkumar Singh (Dipankar Roy 21), Debabrata Roy, Majek Bolaji, Madhab Das, Syed Rahim Nabi, Mehrajuddin Wadoo (Mehtab Hussain 49), Jayanta Sen, Alvito DCunha, Edmilson Marques, McDonald Mukansi (Ashim Biswas 65). Viva Kerala: M.V. Nelson, Ebin Rose, Khelemba Singh, Tutu George, Tabia Othalo, Birua B. Bimal, S. James Singh, Baba Tunde, P. Sajesh, Abbey Wisdom, K.V. Lalu. Referee: A. Arjunan.

 Murali better than Warne, says Arjuna
Melbourne: Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga insists that Muttiah Muralidharan is a better spin bowler than Australian legend Shane Warne as the off-spinner often took wickets without much assistance from other bowlers. Ranatunga said the fact that Muralidharan had reached 700 Test wickets playing lesser number of matches than that of Warne stood proof to the Lankans superiority. If you take the record, Murali has played less matches and Warne never had to bowl at the top-order batsmen. He always had McGrath and Gillespie to take wickets at the start. Warne would come in sometimes and clear the tail. If you look at Murali, he has to come on and take top-order wickets from the start, Ranatunga was quoted as saying by an Australian daily. The 1996 World Cup-winning captain said Muralidharan got his wickets while bowling against better batsmen, especially the Indians who were better players of spin bowling. If you look at the top players who play spin well, especially the Indians, Murali has done pretty well, he said. Murali is far more difficult to play than Warne. Warnie was a really good bowler but I feel Murali is the best. Backing India, Ranatunga said the team from the subcontinent could beat Australia during their forthcoming tour Down Under. This is another opportunity for India to win against Australia, he said. India look a better batting and bowling side now with some younger guys coming through  they should play positive and aggressive cricket. (PTI)

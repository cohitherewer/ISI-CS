 Evidence from hotel matches Bob DNA
Kingston: A Jamaican analyst said genetic evidence found in a hotel room where Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer was discovered unconscious matched the coachs DNA profile. Sharon Brydson, an analyst at the Forensics Science Laboratory in Kingston, said on Tuesday at the inquest into Woolmers death that the 22 swabs of genetic evidence from Woolmers room did not match other DNA samples taken during the murder probe, including those from Pakistan team members staying on the same floor of the hotel. Woolmer, 58, was found on the floor of his rooms bathroom on March 18, a day after Pakistan were eliminated from the World Cup. Pakistan team members, including captain Inzamam-ul Haq, were fingerprinted and swabbed for DNA as part of the murder investigation, though police said they were never suspects. On Monday, Coroner Patrick Murphy, presiding over the inquest, said toxicology samples from the coachs stomach will be re-examined because experts disagree on whether poisoning was a factor in his death. The re-examination and further analysis of the samples, which Murphy ordered to be completed by November 12, is to be done at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica.  (AP)

 Chang, Nirat lead at halfway stage
 - INDIAN OPEN 
 - Jeev Milkha narrowly makes the cut OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Shamim Khan, who at joint fourth was the best-placed Indian after Round 2, in action at the Delhi Golf Club on Friday. (AFP) New Delhi: Chinese Taipeis Chang Tse-peng, a distant cousin of former tennis star Michael Chang, produced a breathtaking round of five-under 67 to emerge joint leader with Thailands rising star Chapchai Nirat (68) after the second day of the $500,000 Hero Honda Indian Open. Nirat, a monk-cum-golfer, hit seven birdies early in the day but a double-bogey on the par-four fourth curbed his progress. The Thai, however, kept his calm despite the ball getting into the bush. I was not angry... The meditation that I do has helped me keep emotions under control, said Nirat, who became a monk only recently. Australian David Gleeson was a stroke behind the top duo following a 68 on Friday. Delhi boy Shamim Khan was the best placed Indian, lying joint fourth with Koreas Hur In-hoi. They trailed the frontrunners by four shots. A total of 25 Indians made the cut. Jeev Milkha Singh just about managed to qualify for the weekend rounds, with a final hole birdie. Jeev, playing here after five years, said he was not too comfortable at the Delhi Golf Club Course. I dont exactly feel at home playing here (Delhi Golf Club), Jeev said. I prefer the Army Golf Course. This course doesnt suit my style of play. I am an aggressive golfer who wants to use the driver more often, but there is little room for that. Asked about the battle ahead, Jeev said: Come what may, I will play my usual aggressive game and wont care where I end up. At one stage on Day Two, the Indian star was in a mess as he went two-over 74 after being done in by a treble of double bogeys. He started his front nine with a double bogey and continued to be inconsistent. On the 15th hole, too, the Chandigarh man dropped two bogeys against six birdies. Caddie-turned-golfer Shamim, on the other hand, had a bright day at the course and carded a four-under 68 to be in joint fourth. His total after two days stood at seven-under 137. Shamim, a local boy, said: I was putting and chipping quite well. This is my home course and I managed to hold my scores even though it was windy. Im going to just keep pushing during the weekend and play my natural game. And Im not thinking of winning, the 28-year-old added. Calcutta s Rahil Gangjee was in fifth place. Rahil carded a five-under 67, sinking four birdies and an eagle on the par-five 14th. His lone bogey on the back nine came on the 16th. Overnight leader Gaurav Ghei (73), defending champion Jyoti Randhawa (69), S.S.P. Chowrasia (71), Australian Unho Park (69) and Malaysias Danny Chia (73) are bunched on 139.

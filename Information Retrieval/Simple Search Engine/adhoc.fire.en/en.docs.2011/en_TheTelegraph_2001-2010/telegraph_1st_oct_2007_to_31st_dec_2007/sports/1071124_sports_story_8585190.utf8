 Rahil, SSP make the cut 
Hanoi: Rahil Gangjee (71) and S. S. P. Chowrasia (72) made the cut for weekend action even as six other Indians fell by the wayside after the second round of the inaugural Vietnam Masters here on Friday. Gangjees 71 saw him jump one rung to tied ninth with a total of four-under 140, while Chowrasia was a shot adrift at the $500,000 event. At the top, Englishman Simon Griffiths (70) was tied for a three-way lead with the Thai duo of Boonchu Ruangkit (70) and Chawalit Plaphol (67). (PTI)

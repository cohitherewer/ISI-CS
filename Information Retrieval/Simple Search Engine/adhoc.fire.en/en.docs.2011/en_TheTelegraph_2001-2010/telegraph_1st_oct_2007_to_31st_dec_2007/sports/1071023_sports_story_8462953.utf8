 Nalbandian aces Roger 
Astrid Andersson Roger Federer greets David Nalbandian after losing to the Argentine in the final of the Madrid Masters on Sunday. Nalbandian won 1-6, 6-3, 6-3. (AFP) Unseeded David Nalbandian claimed a shock victory over world No.1 Roger Federer when he recovered from a set down to clinch his first Masters Series title with a 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 win on Sunday. On his way to the final, Nalbandian beat the worlds No. 2 Rafael Nadal and No. 3 Novak Djokovic to become only the second player  after Djokovic at the Montreal Masters in August  since Boris Becker in 1994 to beat the top three players in the ATP rankings at the same event. The Argentine, who had slipped from a top-10 slot to 25th in the rankings, looked out of it when Federer raced away with the first set. But he became the first man this week to crack the Federer serve when he broke in the second set and he kept his nerve to level the match before taking advantage of some uncharacteristic errors by the Swiss to inflict only Federers seventh defeat of the year. Federer had beaten Nalbandian in eight of their last nine meetings, including a 6-4, 6-0 win in the semi-finals here last year, but the Argentine was the last man to beat him indoors when he won the Masters Cup in Shanghai in 2005. I was very focused, knowing Id have to play incredibly to win, and everything went right for me, Nalbandian said. It was a big boost for me to beat so many good players here this week. Federer admitted he had been unable to hold his opponent in the final two sets. I guess when you beat Nadal and Djokovic back-to-back you come into the final feeling better than ever, Federer said. It was a pity I couldnt stop him today. He played well and came back strong and he was the better player all in all. Federer appeared to be on course for another win after making his customary polished start on the ultra-fast court. He broke the Nalbandian serve in the fourth game after putting the Argentine under pressure with a superb backhand pass, and again in the sixth with a fierce forehand drive as he wrapped up the first set in half an hour. But Nalbandian fought his way back by breaking Federers serve in the second game of the second set. The match was interrupted briefly when the watering system for the courtside flowers sprang a leak, but Nalbandian maintained his concentration and withstood heavy pressure on his serve to take the set 6-3. Federer looked uneasy at the start of the decider and gifted Nalbandian another break in the third game after two uncharacteristically loose shots that drifted beyond the baseline. Nalbandian kept Federer on the ropes with some excellent serving and deep returns and broke again in the ninth to claim the sixth ATP title of his career and make up for the disappointment of losing to Marat Safin in the 2004 final. The womens world No.1, Justine Henin, secured her ninth WTA title of the season on Sunday, beating French teenager Tatiana Golovin 6-4, 6-4 in the Zurich Open final. The Belgian has won all but four of the 13 tournaments she has entered this year and is now unbeaten in 20 matches.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

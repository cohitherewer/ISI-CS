 Jeev falters in Round 3
Kochi: Jeev Milkha Singhs hopes of defending the title went up in smoke after the Indian pro returned his worst card of the week, a nightmarish four-over 76, to slide to tied 51st after the penultimate round in the Casio World Open here Saturday. With one more round to go, Jeev totalled three-over 219 after rounds of 75, 68 and 76. Compatriot Shiv Kapur, however, came up with his best show of the week so far, carding one-under 71 to total two-over 218 for a share of the 39th slot. Jeev birdied the fourth, ninth and 18th holes but was greeted with a bogey hattrick on his back stretch which completely derailed his campaign. He also dropped a shot each on the sixth and 17th holes and as if it was not bad enough, he double bogeyed the par-four 16th to stutter to a round of 76. In contrast, Kapur, who had rounds of 74 and 73, was unfazed by a bogey quartet and reeled off five birdies to keep things under control and move up the leader-board. At the top of the table, Chris Campbell blasted a sizzling eight-under 64 to total nine-under 207 and grab the sole lead with a one-stroke lead over Toru Taniguchi (70) and Ij Chang (72). (PTI)

 Becks rules out return
Vicki HodgesEngland midfielder David Beckham will not return to the Premier League for a loan stint during the Major League Soccer close season. Sunderland have become the latest club thought to be interested in signing the former Real Madrid winger on a six-month loan. But Beckhams spokesman has said the LA Galaxy player will not be joining Sunderland or any other Premier League club next month. There will be no loan moves or short-term contracts. He is under contract to the Galaxy, the spokesman said. Beckham is currently sidelined with a knee injury suffered playing for the Galaxy in the Superliga final at the end of August. His club have coped admirably in his absence, however. They are unbeaten in four league games  which includes three straight wins  to push themselves into play-off contention. It is thought Beckham, who will miss Englands Euro 2008 qualifiers against Estonia and Russia this month, could be fit to return for the Galaxy should they reach the play-offs.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Mahelas reminder

Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene has urged his team to remember the lessons of Englands 2001 tour and make sure they do not squander their 1-0 lead after winning the first Test by 88 runs. 
Sri Lanka won the first Test of the 2001 series in Galle but then lost the next two matches. 
The defeat in that 2001 series still hurts and the memories of it will make sure we hit England hard in Colombo, Jaywardene said. 
Sri Lanka will be making one certain change from Kandy with opener Upul Tharanga replacing Sanath Jayasuriya, who retired after Sri Lankas win on Wednesday. 
Englands preparations have been dogged by fitness concerns over Matthew Hoggard, their best bowler in Kandy before the recurrence of an earlier back injury. 
Peter Moores admitted that Hoggard was very doubtful for the Test starting on Sunday. 
We have one seamer extra with Steve Harmison having joined so we wont be calling for replacements unless someone else breaks down. 
Hoggards absence weakens Englands attack considerably and their selection will now revolve around identifying the best bowling combination to take 20 wickets. 
We are 1-0 down and we need to win if we are going to be able to go to Galle to win the series, said Moores. 
England have the option of drafting in Graeme Swann to give extra variety and greater batting depth, or playing Stuart Broad or Harmison. 
The good news for England is that Kevin Pietersen is batting again without painkillers after fracturing a finger. 
Pietersen batted today and should hopefully be fine, Moores added.

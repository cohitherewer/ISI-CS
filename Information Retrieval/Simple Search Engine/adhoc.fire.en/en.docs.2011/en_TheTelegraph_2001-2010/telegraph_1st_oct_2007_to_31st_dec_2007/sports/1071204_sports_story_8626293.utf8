A STAFF REPORTER East Bengals Edmilson Marques (left) and Ashim Biswas after their 3-2 win over Salgaocar in the I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: East Bengal returned to winning ways, beating 10-man Salgaocar 3-2 in their third ONGC I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. East Bengal had lost their second match 1-3 to JCT at the same venue last Friday. Edmilson Marques scored twice  once from a penalty  while Ashim Biswas scored the other. For Salgaocar, Biju Kumar and Shylo Malsawmtluanga found the target. The match witnessed some ugly scenes as players of both sides were engaged in a free-for-all in the second half, following Remus Gomess rough tackle which brought Ashim down. Gomes was rightly given the marching orders while Alvito DCunha and Rocus Lamare were booked by referee P.K. Bose. At the onset, Salgaocar had control over proceedings with more ball possession, but the East Bengal defence looked more compact in comparison to their last match. Perhaps it could be due to M. Sureshs return as the central defender. East Bengal shot into the lead in the 19th minute when Syed Rahim Nabis cross from the left was headed home by an unmarked Edmilson. Five minutes into the second session, the equaliser came from Salgaocars Biju Kumar. Biju met Nicholas Rodrigues cross inside the six-yard box but his header struck the horizontal. Within nine minutes, East Bengal were up again. A Mehtab Hussain centre was nodded in by Ashim after Edmilson failed to connect. Just after the second goal, East Bengal increased their speed in search of more goals and Salgaocar, failing to match that, resorted to rough football. A free-for-all took place but the referee managed to keep matters under control by flashing a red card to Gomes to and a couple of yellow cards. Down to 10 men, Salgaocar went into the defensive. They conceded another goal in the 68th minute. An advancing Edmilson was brought down by Biju inside the box and the local team was awarded a spot-kick. Edmilson took it upon himself to put his team 3-1 up. Even after conceding the third goal, the Goans continued to fight. They were rewarded in the 75th minute when Man of the Match Felix Chimaoqwe sent an addressed through to Shylo Malsawmtluanga, who slotted the ball home in a clinical finish.

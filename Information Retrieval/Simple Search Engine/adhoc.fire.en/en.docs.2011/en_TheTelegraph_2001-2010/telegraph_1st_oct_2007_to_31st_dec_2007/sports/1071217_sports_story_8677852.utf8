 Indian bid likely for meet

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
New Delhi: India may bid to host the 16-nation AFC Challenge Cup next year, according to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources. 
The bid is likely to be placed in the AFC meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur on Monday and Tuesday. Both AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and general secretary Alberto Colaco are attending the meeting. 
The AFC Challenge Cup is contested by 16 nations ranked below 16 in the AFC rankings. The champions will receive an automatic entry into the 2011 AFC Cup. 
Tajikistan won the inaugural Challenge Cup in 2006, hosted by Bangladesh. 
At the moment there is some uncertainty about the venue as original hosts, Chinese Taipei, have backed out. AFC asked Thailand to stage the meet but they too may go the Chinese Taipei way. 
The tournament was scheduled from March 1 to 16, but now it will be held at a later date, said a source in the AIFF. If it suits Indias domestic schedule, AIFF would like to host the tournament. 
National coach Bob Houghton is believed to be very much interested in India holding the meet and he has impressed upon the AIFF officials to try and shift it to India. Given the success of the Nehru Cup recently, the AIFF officials are also keen to showcase the national side in front of the home crowd. 
Meanwhile, the draw for AFC Cup 2011 and the group stage for the AFC Club Cup 2008 will also be held on Monday. 
In the club cup, a total of 20 teams will be drawn into five groups of four each. Two teams from India  East Bengal and Dempo  are in the fray.

 Galibardy blames it on lack of talent
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Joseph Deville Galibardy has stopped following hockey. But the nonagenarian is aware that the game has few takers these days. Joe Galibardy, as he is popularly known in the sporting fraternity, is the only surviving member of the 1936 Olympics hockey team that won the gold in Berlin. On Thursday, he was in the city on way to attending the centenary programme of Goethals Memorial School, Kurseong. An alumnus of the school, Galibardy left hockey in 1956 and emigrated to England. India met Germany in the final on August 15, 1936, and won 8-1. In a warm up match on the first day, Germany beat us 4-1. But we got the gold medal in the end, he said. The Fhrer was present at the final, reminisced Galibardy. I have little to say as I stopped following the sport long time back But I think natural talent is lacking. Most of the youngsters these days are getting into cricket as hockey hardly earns good money, added his son Naville, who was present with his father at the press conference. Galibardy will be in Kurseong on Saturday to attend the centenary programme of the school.

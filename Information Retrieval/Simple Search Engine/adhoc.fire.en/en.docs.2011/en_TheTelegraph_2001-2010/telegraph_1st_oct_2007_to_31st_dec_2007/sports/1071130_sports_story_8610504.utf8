 Azharuddin: Pak lack experience
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: For someone whos 44, Mohammed Azharuddin looks remarkably fit without a shade of flab. And on Friday  Day I of second India-Pakistan Test  hell be back at the Eden after a gap of nine seasons. This time, though, as CABs special invitee. His Test appearances still stand at a tantalising 99  one less than that magic mark. Azhars last appearance at the Eden was in 1998-99, also against Pakistan. Its no wonder then that he is overwhelmed to be back in the venue where he averages a boastful 107.5 from seven appearances. Youve a feeling from inside I dont know what is there in the ground but its true that there are some grounds for which youve a feeling from inside and Eden is one such, the former Indian captain told The Telegraph. Im very happy to be here and quite excited. However, Azharuddin feels Pakistan are a depleted side. They look like a depleted side Except for Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan they lack in experience In the last match they missed Umar Gul badly, he said. When told that Gul is ruled out for this match as well, thats even worse, he quipped. Azharuddin, who has come here despite wife Sangeeta Bijlani being unwell, said: There have been lots of great moments here. But winning the Hero Cup was quite memorable especially the phase was good as till that time we were not doing well and that was a turning point of sorts. One of the most successful Indian captains, the wristy Azharuddin voted for Anil Kumble. He fully deserves it. Having played under lot of captains Hes a very experienced campaigner. The Hyderabadi also gave thumbs up to the Twenty20 format: Cricket is changing. Its not how we used to play Thats natural. That shows the changing society, change in trends Twenty20 is more intense and good for the game On Rahul Dravid stepping down and whether captaining India was the toughest job, he said: Captaincy is always a matter of pressure whether you win or lose. I dont know what happened with (Rahul) Dravid Im not in a position to comment.

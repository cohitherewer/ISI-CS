 Schumi to return, provisionally
London: Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher will come out of retirement to test Ferraris title-winning 2007 Formula One car in Barcelona next week, the team said on Tuesday. Its half for pleasure, half for technical reasons, said a spokesman. Schumacher, 38, retired from Formula One at the end of the 2006 season after winning 91 Grands Prix in the most successful career of any driver. The German has stayed out of the limelight since, although he attended several races this year as a Ferrari technical adviser. The team won both of this years titles, taking the drivers crown with Kimi Raikkonen. Formula Ones technical rules are changing next year, with traction control systems and other so-called driver aids being removed. Michael has a big experience in driving cars with no traction control and no electronic aids, so it makes sense for him to give his input, said Schumachers spokeswoman. Although Schumacher said in May he had no desire to step back into a Formula One car, team boss Jean Todt has made clear that the offer was always there. Todt said that if Michael had the desire to drive the car, he would be happy to fulfil it, said the spokesman. Schumacher has not taken part in a test since he retired, although he did drive the F2007 for a few laps in the wet at Ferraris Fiorano track at the end of last month to coincide with a visit of the board of parent company Fiat.

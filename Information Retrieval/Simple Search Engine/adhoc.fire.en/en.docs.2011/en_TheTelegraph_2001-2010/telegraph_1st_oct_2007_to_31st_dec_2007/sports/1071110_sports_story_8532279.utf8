				 																																																				Kingston: Bora Milutinovic, who coached five teams to the World Cup finals, was fired as coach and technical director by the Jamaica Football Federation.				 																																																				The JFF informed Serbian-born Milutinovic on Wednesday that it was sacking him for breach of contract. A statement from the JFF on Thursday didnt elaborate on the breach, and calls to president Captain Horace Burrell and his executive were not returned. Milutinovic took over as coach and technical director of Jamaicas soccer program last November, and led the team to the Lunar Cup title earlier this year. But Jamaica hasnt played since July and fallen in the Fifa world rankings to 103.				 																																																				Milutinovic received a four-year contract, partially funded by the government. 				 																																																				Zurich: FIFA has lifted its ban on the Kuwait Football Association (KFA) after the association agreed to meet several demands made by world soccers governing body.

The organising body said it had made its decision following an extraordinary general assembly of the KFA on November 4.				 																																																				The assembly voted to remove the board of directors whose appointment on October 9 led to the Fifa ban. It also reinstated a transition committee set up by Fifa in March to lead the association into new elections.

Obviously its a long story of doping and discussions with Telekom, Jim Runau, Adidas Group spokesman, said on Thursday. We have told Telekom of our decision and we are in talks to get out of the contract early.				 																																																				Bangkok: IBF world heavyweight champion Vladimir Klitschko said on Thursday he was confident he would get the chance to unify the WBO, IBF and WBA titles next year.

If Klitschko beats Russian Ibragimov, he is likely to next face WBA champion Ruslan Chagaev. Hopefully, in the near future we will get unification bouts and there will be no question, he said. Im number one and looking to unify the title. Its possible and I think next year there will be unification.

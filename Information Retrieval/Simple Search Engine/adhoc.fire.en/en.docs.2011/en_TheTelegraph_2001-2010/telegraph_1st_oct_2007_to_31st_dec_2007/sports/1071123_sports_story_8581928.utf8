 Randhawa gives India solid start
 Gaurav Ghei and Jyoti Randhawa on Day I of the World Cup in Shenzhen on Thursday. (AP) Dongguan (China): Jyoti Randhawa dazzled with a birdie binge to give India a solid start in the Omega Mission Hills World Cup golf as the seasoned pro and compatriot Gaurav Ghei fired seven-under 65 to end the day in a share of the 11th place here on Thursday. Randhawa reeled off six birdies to produce a stellar show that had Ghei highly impressed. Jyoti played really well. I was just riding along, said Ghei. On his part, Randhawa said he thoroughly enjoyed Gheis company and patted his partner for keeping the round blemish-free. Gaurav was there all the time and that gives you a lot of support and I got aggressive and made birdies. Whenever we needed pars, he made it. Its not that I was the only one who played...Its a good team effort. Not dropping bogey was a great effort from us, said Randhawa. It was easy to click as a team. We were great. A few times, he read my lines and I read his lines. There were a lot of things that we talked about on the golf course, which cannot be printed! We were relaxed out there, Randhawa said. Meanwhile, Thai duo of Thongchai Jaidee and Prayad Marksaeng joked their way to a nine-under 63 to lead the Asian charge. Thongchai contributed six birdies in the better-ball format while Prayad sank three birdies at the Mission Hills Golf Clubs Olazabal course to end the day in joint third place. Thongchai was two behind the US team of Book Weekley and Heath Slocum who combined for a blistering 61 to lead by one shot from Germany, represented by Alex Cejka and Martin Kaymer in the $5 million event billed as the Olympics of golf.

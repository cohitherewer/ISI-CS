 Dilip remark irks Rajput
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Rajput Chandigarh: Team India cricket manager Lalchand Rajput on Sunday has taken strong exception to the reported comment made by the chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar that senior cricketers should either perform or make way for the juniors like S. Badrinath or Suresh Raina. Speaking to the The Telegraph here, Rajput, who was also the manager of the Indian team that won the ICC World Twenty20, said he was highly disappointed with Vengsarkars comments at this juncture of the series. This is not the right time for him (Vengsarkar) to say such things, that too being the chairman of the selection committee, Rajput said. There is pressure on the team and complete focus is on the match. This is a very, very crucial game for us. On Saturday, Vengsarkar told a section of the media that seniors needed to raise their game, especially in the wake of the World Twenty20. There are many players like S. Badrinath and Suresh Raina who are performing with the India A side. These guys are waiting for their chance and you cannot ignore them. Its a professional set-up and nobody can take their place for granted. The former India captain also criticised the fielding of the current Indian side. We are not a great fielding side anyway, he commented. Australia saved about 25 runs on the field. If we had fielded that way, the match would have been much closer, said Vengsarkar about the game in Hyderabad.

 Jeev ends tied 40th
Vilamoura: Jeev Milkha Singh signed off with a sedate 71 to finish tied 40th. But final round blues came to haunt compatriot Shiv Kapur, who carded his worst round of the week, a 77, to be tied 64th in the Portugal Masters. Jeevs rounds of 70,67,70 and 71 saw him aggregate 10-under 278 and get richer by Euro 18000 for his exploit, while Kapur totalled four-under 284 to pocket Euro 6900. Jeev mixed three birdies and two bogeys in his final round, while for Kapur, it was a nightmarish experience. After rounds of 67,70 and 70, Kapur went into the final round hoping to notch up another decent show following his tied 18th finish in the Open de Madrid last week. But after three days of steady golf, he was suddenly and he could not sink in a single birdie in his final round. And things became only worse as he bled bogeys, the first of which came on the fifth hole. On the back stretch, Kapur bogeyed the 11th, 12th, 17th and 18th holes to complete his misery. Meanwhile, Steve Webster lifted his second European tour title with a brilliant final round 64 for a 25-under 263.  (PTI)

 Anil Kumble amp; Co. thrust into a test of character

 - The boys are determined... The mood in the dressing room is to fight, says Chetan Chauhan

			Harbhajan Singh celebrates one of his three wickets at the MCG on Friday
Melbourne: Most here are convinced that the opening 3mobile Test will finish on Saturday itself, with Australia posting yet another win. 
Given Team Indias appalling batting in the first innings, its difficult arguing with that view. However, as Harbhajan Singh put it, anything is possible with the line-up weve got. 
In reality, for all his bravado, only the most courageous (or reckless) will bet on anything other than an Australian victory. 
Its not that the Indians have thrown in the towel, though. 
Makeshift opener Rahul Dravids body language, for example, was pleasingly different and he chose to face the first ball (from Brett Lee) instead of specialist Wasim Jaffer. 
Ricky Pontings declaration at 351 for seven set India a never-before-achieved target of 499. The openers, however, played out eight overs to deny the Australians their last objective of the day  wickets before the close on Friday. 
The boys are determined... The mood in the dressing room is to fight... Weve got to take it session by session, lets see how it goes, manager (and former India opener) Chetan Chauhan told The Telegraph. 
Michael Clarke, who top scored with 73 (opener Phil Jaques, by the way, got his second fifty of the Test), agreed that the Indians had a very strong batting line-up, but added scoring would be difficult once the ball became soft. 
Also, reverse swing could be a real big factor. 
According to Clarke, the key for both teams will be patience. He was quite patient himself and explained hed been more determined. I got out early in the first innings, but was intent on a big score the second time around... 
Clarke talked about patience but, more than anything else, its a test of character for Anil Kumble and Co. 
Theyve often spoken about challenges and being up for them. The biggest has arrived within three days of this four-Test series. 
So, its time to go beyond the mere rhetorical. 
Ponting went cheaply, to newest 250 Club entrant Harbhajan once again, but every other batsman made a contribution on a slow wicket with dual bounce. 
The Indian bowlers, in fact, made little impact and it didnt help that spearhead Zaheer Khan sent down 12 no-balls. 
For the record, weve got a specialist bowling coach  Venkatesh Prasad, a one-time medium-pacer. 
Weve also got a specialist fielding coach (Robin Singh), but the effort on the ground was pretty inadequate. And thats not being harsh. 
You just cant field like this if youre wanting to compete with Australia, pointed out former captain Bill Lawry. 
To compete, mind you, quality fielding isnt the only requirement.

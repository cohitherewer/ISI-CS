 Jaques, Hussey on the rampage 
 Mike Hussey on way to his unbeaten 101 on Friday Hobart: Mike Hussey and Phil Jacques posted back-to-back hundreds and Muttiah Muralidharan closed in a bowling world record Friday in the second Test between Australia and Sri Lanka. Their performances came as an extended media rights dispute between Cricket Australia and the three major international news agencies was settled just before stumps Friday on the first day. The News Media Coalition (NMC) has reached an agreement in its talks with Cricket Australia (CA) regarding news coverage during the current season, the agencies said in a statement. After winning the toss and electing to bat, Australia reached 329 for three at the end of the first day at Bellerive Oval. Hussey, who also scored a century in Australias innings and 40-run win in the first Test in Brisbane, was unbeaten on 101 and Michael Clarke was batting on 8. Jaques was out for 150 and Sri Lankan spin bowler Muralidharan, who started the Bellerive match needing seven wickets to surpass Shane Warnes record 708 Test wickets, returned one for 62 from 25 overs. The AP, Reuters and Agence France-Presse were locked out of the first Test last week after refusing conditions of accreditation that limited the distribution of news and images from Cricket Australia venues and a demand for a license fee. The move caused a backlash from newspapers, particularly in Sri Lanka and India, because of a lack of images and reports of the cricket usually provided by major news agencies.  (AP)

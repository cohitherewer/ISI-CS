 Bob death probe hasty, says official
Kingston: Police may have spoken prematurely when they declared Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer was murdered in his hotel room during the World Cup, Jamaicas top security official testified. From what I have seen, they may have done things too hastily, security minister Derrick Smith told a Coroners inquest on Friday. He said he based that conclusion on an unreleased government report on the investigation into the death of Woolmer. Jamaicas pathologist maintains that he died of asphyxia and pesticide poisoning. A forensic scientist recently testified that he found lethal amounts of Cypermethrin in Woolmers stomach samples, contradicting foreign experts who also analysed samples and found no pesticide.

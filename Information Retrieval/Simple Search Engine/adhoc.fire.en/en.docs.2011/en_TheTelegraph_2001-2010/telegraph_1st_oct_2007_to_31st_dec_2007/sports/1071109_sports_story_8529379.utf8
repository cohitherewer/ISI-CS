 Teams fined 
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: India and Pakistan have been fined for slow over-rate during the second ODI in Mohali on Thursday. Match Referee Roshan Mahanama imposed the fines after both the teams were ruled to be one over short of their targets when time allowances were taken into consideration. In accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct regulations governing over-rate penalties, players are fined five per cent of their match fees for every over bowled short, with the captain fined double that amount. As such, rival captains Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Shoaib Malik have been fined 10 per cent of their match fees while their players received five per cent fines each.

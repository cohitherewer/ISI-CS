 Weather plays spoilsport 
 STAR RACER Calcutta: Inclement weather and failures of favourites left the punters a battered lot on Thursday, the concluding day of the monsoon season. However, jockey Imran Chisty and trainer had a reason to celebrate during the afternoon with goodies like championship titles in their respective fields. The treble scored by the jockey and a brace of winners by the trainer were the additional bonus on the day which bid goodbye to the 14-day season. 				 										However, with the winter season beginning from October 25 there will no respite for the punters and the professionals. Cyrus Madan, chief steward, RCTC, however, emphasised at the media conference in the morning that with the stakes money hiked from a near Rs 3 crore to over Rs 6 crore, the new season would be different.

 Prasun faces heat at CAB too
A STAFF REPORTER Prasun Mukherjee Calcutta: The state governments decision to transfer Prasun Mukherjee and four other police officers in connection with the Rizwanur Rahman case caused immediate ripples in the CAB. The ruling group wasted no time in defending the CAB president, who was the commissioner of police till Wednesday afternoon. There is no question of Mukherjee resigning, he will serve out his full term (till July 2008), they said. The opposition was equally vehement in demanding Mukherjees resignation. He must leave his chair on moral grounds, they argued. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees announcement that the five police officials would be removed with immediate effect surprised CAB joint secretary Samar Paul. It has come as a surprise but its a government decision. The CAB is not run by the government, we will follow our rules, Paul told newspersons on Wednesday evening. With its president under the scanner, shouldnt the CAB convene a meeting to discuss the issue? I see no reason why we need to discuss all this Paul said. Nothing has been proved against him in the first place. He has been elected president of the CAB till July 2008, why should he step down before that? Pauls remark reflects the brave front the ruling group is trying to put up. But they all know that the number of members who feel Mukherjee should resign is not insignificant. Letters from 20 members are needed to call a special general meeting to discuss any important matter. According to a member from the rival group, the numbers could easily add up against the president if he decides to continue. Mukherjee should have put in his papers earlier. Now that the government has taken action against him, he should definitely do so immediately, said former assistant secretary Biswarup Dey, known to be a Jagmohan Dalmiya loyalist. The CAB presidents post is an office of high repute. Its image has been tarnished if he has any sense of morality, Mukherjee should quit, Dey said, adding that the president chaired the working committee meeting earlier this month despite objections. It remains to be seen what Mukherjee does, but the next few days promise to be eventful. Mukherjees predecessor has not been involved with the CAB for almost a year, but there is no doubt that the Dalmiya factor will come into play in the coming days.

 Long way to go: Sushmita
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Sushmita Jamshedpur: Sushmita Singh Roy won the only medal for Bengal in the 47th National Open Athletics Championship which concluded at the JRD Tata Sports Complex here on Friday. Sushmita won the high jump bronze with an effort of 1.65m. Bengals Mallika Mondol leaped the same 1.65m to claim fourth place. After all my injuries, even winning a bronze was not easy. I feel good that I managed to secure a medal for my state, Sushmita told The Telegraph. This meet helped me evaluate my shortcomings. I still have much work to do. There are a lot of improvements to be made for me to come up to international standards, she said. Sushmita has been bothered by a hamstring injury and now has developed problems in her ankle as well. Sushmita said that she is bracing up to overcome all her problems and perform her best for the selection trials for the Olympics. Although I have improved on my javelin throw, a lot of speed work has to be done, she said. I have started swimming and also doing slow jogging to improve my fitness, she added.

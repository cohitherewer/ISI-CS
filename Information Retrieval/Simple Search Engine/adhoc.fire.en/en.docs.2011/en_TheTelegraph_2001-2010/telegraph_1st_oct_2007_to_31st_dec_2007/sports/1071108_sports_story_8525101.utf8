 Sania bowled over by Akhtar 
 Sania Mirza Chandigarh: Shoaib Akhtar has won an admirer in tennis ace Sania Mirza. Sania, in the city to watch the second Indo-Pak match in Mohali on Thursday, said she was a fan of Shoaib Malik and Shahid Afridi as well, but the Rawalpindi Express stood apart because of his aggression. Shoaib Malik is good and I also liked Afridi for a while. But personally, I like Shoaib Akhtars aggression. He is a great cricketer, Sania said at the Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association (CLTA) Stadium here on Wednesday. Sania said she would be watching her first India-Pakistan ODI live on Thursday. The last one I watched was between India and New Zealand in Hyderabad, said Sania, whose father and some friends are accompanying her. Sania, who spent the last weekend in Goa trying to relax during the off season, said she would restart training at the end of this month. I am trying to relax during the off-season, she said, adding that a return from injury takes a lot of physical and mental effort. Sania cut short her assignments after pulling a stomach muscle in Japan last month but is expected to be ready to play in the Hopman Cup in Perth from December 30. Sania, currently ranked 32, said she was constantly trying to improve her ranking. Though being No. 32 in the world is not bad, I am working hard. Maybe some day I will be there (in the top league), she said. The tennis ace also said that she would do her best to win a medal in Beijing. I have never played in the Olympics. Its going to be my first Olympic Games and also my first event in China, she said. Asked about her memories of playing at the CLTA, Sania said it has been around six years sice she last played here. I remember that I was playing in the under-18 semi-final match when I sustained a knee injury. The scar is still there, but I went on to win that match after being down 2-5 in the second set and won the final as well, she said. (PTI)

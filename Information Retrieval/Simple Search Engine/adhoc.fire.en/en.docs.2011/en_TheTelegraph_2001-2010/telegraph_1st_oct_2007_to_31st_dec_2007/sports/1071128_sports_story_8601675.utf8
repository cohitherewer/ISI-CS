 Ferguson charged by FA
MARK OGDEN Alex Ferguson Sir Alex Ferguson has been charged by the Football Association with using abusive and insulting words towards an official following his half-time altercation with Mark Clattenburg at Bolton (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). The Manchester United manager has until December 11 to respond. However, he made it clear on Monday that he stills felt aggrieved about the Tyneside referees performance during Saturdays surprise 0-1 defeat that allowed Arsenal to move three points clear at the top of the Premier League. Ferguson was banished to the stands for the second half at the Reebok Stadium after complaining to Clattenburg about Wanderers over-aggressive tactics, typified by a particularly heavy challenge on Patrice Evra by Kevin Davies. The FA were always likely to take action once they examined Clattenburgs version of events, but on Monday, while Fergusons comments were more measured, they were not entirely repentant. You can expect a team in Boltons position to play that way, he said. You expect a team near the bottom to battle, scrap and fight. But the key thing is how the referee controls it. Ironically, earlier this month, Ferguson claimed Clattenburg was one of the Premier Leagues best referees, although he has not brought them much luck this season, taking charge of the matches at Manchester City and Bolton which both ended in defeat. Ferguson was hit with a two-match touchline ban and a 10,000 fine four years ago after a stinging attack on the fourth official.  The Daily Telegraph

 I was a bit tense, admits Paul

A STAFF REPORTER
Calcutta: Shib Shankar Paul was feeling on top of the world after completing a five-wicket haul in the Ranji Trophy Super League tie against Uttar Pradesh at the Eden. 
He last had a fiver in the 2005-06 Ranji Trophy semi-final. 
I missed the last season because of injury and this time it wasnt just happening. I was a bit tense and it felt great to have finally achieved the feat after a long gap, he said. 
Paul said his clenched-fist celebration after completing the haul was not meant to convey anything. 
The tall, strapping fast bowler felt that all hope was not lost in the match. All bowlers tried their best But things dont always go your way. 
We need to bat sensibly and have the capability to deny UP a direct win The pitch is getting slower and its not easy for the bowlers, he said. 
Piyush Chawla, who scored a half-century, said he enjoyed batting with captain Mohammed Kaif. 
Making a comeback into the national side is not in my hands. My job is to perform, said the leggie.

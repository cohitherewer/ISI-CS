 Messi strikes in 2-0 victory 
 Messi after scoring his goal against Venezuela Maracaibo: Lionel Messi added another superb goal to his collection to help Argentina beat Venezuela 2-0 away in a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday. Messi struck two minutes before half-time after his Barcelona teammate Gabriel Milito had given Argentina the lead with his first goal for his country on his 30th appearance. The win gave Argentina, who have won all 15 meetings with Venezuela, maximum points from their first two games in the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup. Venezuela, the only South American team never to have played at the World Cup, have three points from two games after winning in Ecuador on Saturday. Argentina went ahead three minutes when defender Milito rose to head home Juan Roman Riquelmes free-kick. Riquelme had scored both goals direct from free kicks in Argentinas 2-0 win over Chile on Saturday. Venezuela enjoyed plenty of possession but could not find the final pass and fell further behind two minutes before half-time. Carlos Tevez broke down the right and pulled the ball back to the edge of the area where Messi breezed by one defender with his first touch, then unleashed an unstoppable shot past Renny Vega. Venezuela enjoyed a flourish after the break as Juan Arango broke clear but shot straight at Roberto Abbondanzieri and Maldonado headed over from a corner. Messi had the ball in the net again in the 65th minute but his effort was ruled out for offside. As the Venezuelan defence opened up, Esteban Cambiasso hit the post for Argentina 10 minutes from time and debutant striker German Denis, who came on in the 81st minute, missed an easy chance in injury time.

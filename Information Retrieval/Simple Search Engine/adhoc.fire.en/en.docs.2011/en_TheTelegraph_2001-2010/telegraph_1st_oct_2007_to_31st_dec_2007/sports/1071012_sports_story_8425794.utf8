 Senna spirit drives Hamilton
Kevin Garside Hamilton Those concerned about the capacity of Lewis Hamilton to cope with the demands of winning the Formula One world championship, having thrown it away in Shanghai, have yet to get their heads around just what this boy is about. It is pointless measuring responses according to a common standard. It serves no purpose to imagine how we might deal with a weekend as portentous as that coming up in Brazil next week, were any of us behind the wheel of his McLaren. Console yourself with the thought that Hamilton himself does not know how he manages the maelstrom of emotions associated with becoming the ninth Briton to claim the greatest prize in motor sport, not to mention the addition of three defining statistics all his own; youngest winner, first rookie champion, first black driver. If anything Im mentally stronger. Other drivers might be on the back foot and struggling after experiencing something like that. But I have taken the negatives and turned them into a positive. Its not the end of the world. I can bounce back. Im four points ahead. I just need to go out there and do a good job. To recap, Hamilton was 26 laps from annihilating the F1 annals when he beached his McLaren on entry to the pit lane. His tyres were shot. Hamilton accepts that it might have been better to approach the Chinese Grand Prix with the focus on winning the championship rather than the race. It was just unfortunate. We were in a perfect position to win the championship. But I wanted to win the race. I was out there driving for the win. I understand the position Im in. We cant take risks thats for sure. Maybe at the last race I did take a risk. Hamilton was back in the bosom of his family within 24 hours, plugging into an atmosphere that he describes as his power plant. A week in the company of friends and relatives, the odd round of golf, a run in the woods with his trainer Adam, adds up to rocket fuel for the assault on history that he is about to unleash within shouting distance of Ayrton Sennas resting place. The link with Hamiltons childhood hero is more than a narrative convenience. The yellow helmet is no coincidence, the silver McLaren, in which Senna thrice conquered the world, has resonance for Hamilton because of the Brazilians deeds a generation ago. Senna would have approved of Hamiltons individual streak and his love of family. When asked if he would be paying a visit to Sennas grave in the Morumbi cemetery, Hamilton was Senna-like in his response. It would be quite emotional, quite moving for me to go there. It is something I will think about doing, but only after the race. I have enough on my plate. I think it is important I go to Brazil with a clear mind and one aim.. No other distractions. I think I have done pretty well all year in terms of finishing in good positions. And after having a DNF [did not finish] Im still leading the championship with a good chance of winning it. With that in mind it is still pretty cool. Im in the best position to win in Brazil in a good car that should suit the circuit.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

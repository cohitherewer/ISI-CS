Having helped Bengal to two successive Ranji Trophy finals, nobody can read Bengal players minds better than Mhambrey. He will surely have his strategic in place accordingly and look to exploit the home condition. For Baroda, the match against Bengal will be their first tie. Bengal coach Bharat Arun is aware of the Mhambrey factor. The boys are aware of the fact and we need to rectify our shortcomings before the big match. We really, really have to play well to win the match in Baroda. It will be a good contest, Arun told The Telegraph from Chennai. After celebrating Diwali with his family, Arun will be back in the city on Saturday morning. The team will have a practice on Saturday afternoon before leaving for Baroda on Sunday. Captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, however, had a different view. Obviously, theres a lot of pressure on us now. But Mhambrey factor cant be an advantage for Baroda. Every match is tough Its a positive sign that our spin department has shaped up, so lets hope for the best, said Shukla. A senior Bengal player termed the draw against Hyderabad as a dark Diwali.

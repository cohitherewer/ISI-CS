 McLaren fine amount to promote safety
Paris: McLaren will pay more than half of their record $100 million fine to the FIA in December. The FIA, which fined them in September for possessing confidential documents belonging to Ferrari, said on Wednesday that a sum in excess of $50 million would be used to promote safety in the sport around the world. Especially in countries where the motor sport infrastructure is in need of support, the FIA said in a statement on its website. The money represents a fine handed to McLaren in September as a result of a spying controversy. The FIA had imposed on McLaren a $100 million fine and the loss of their 2007 constructors points. The fine included McLarens expected loss of income. The FIA then said the size of the fine could be halved ultimately, with revenues and prize money deducted from it according to where the team would have ended up at the end of the season with the points scored prior to the hearing. The FIAs World Motor Sport Council also approved a request from Singapore to host the first Grand Prix to be held at night.  (AGENCIES)

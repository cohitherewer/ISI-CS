 Moores looks at Ramprakash
NEIL HALLAMPeter Moores, the England coach, has said he will consider Surrey batsman Mark Ramprakashs claim to a Test recall at the age of 38. Ramprakash, who scored 2,000 County Championship runs for the second successive season this year, has not played for his country since 2002.  But amid reports that he may be back in contention to be named on Friday in the squad to travel to Sri Lanka, Moores acknowledged: Obviously, Mark had a great season. He has certainly warranted discussion. Moores also had heartening news of Andrew Flintoff, following the allrounders latest bout of surgery on his problem left ankle three days ago. It is widely anticipated that Flintoff will not be able to play again until the start of next summer, but Moores was able to confirm successful surgery and an optimistic long-term prognosis for the 29-year-old. The operation apparently went very well, Moores said. They found some fragments of bone and are confident he will make a full recovery.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

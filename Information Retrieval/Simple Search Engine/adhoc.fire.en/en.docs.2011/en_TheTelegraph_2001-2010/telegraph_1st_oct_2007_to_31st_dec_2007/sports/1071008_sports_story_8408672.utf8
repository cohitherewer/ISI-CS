 Bengal lift U-16 title
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTChandigarh: Bengal won the under-16 National football championship for the Mir Iqbal Hussain Trophy for the second consecutive year when they defeated Uttar Pradesh 2-1 in the final at Haldwani on Sunday. According to reports reaching here, Bengal, who led 2-0 at the half time, scored both their goals through Suprovan Dhar to emerge winners in front of 3,000 odd partisan crowds.

In the final, Dhar opened the scoring in the 17th minute after he was put through by Amit Singh. Dhar doubled the score in the 30th minute making best use of a pass from Andrews. Uttar Pradesh pulled one back through Krishna Kumar.

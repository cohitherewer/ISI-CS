 Raina wins it for India Blue 
 India Blues Suresh Raina during his knock of 92 in Ahmedabad on Thursday. (PTI) Ahmedabad: Suresh Raina sent out a clear signal to the national selectors about his fitness and form with a composed 92 to help India Blue beat India Red by 12 runs in the Challenger Trophy on Thursday. Chasing a target of 247, India Red could manage 234 for eight in their 50 overs. Raina, who came in to bat with India Blue in dire straits at 41 for four, batted calmly. He shared a 87 run partnership with Niraj Patel (35) for the fifth wicket and then partnered Joginder Sharma (27) to help India Blue reach 246 in 49.3 overs. After being out of action for most of the year, Raina made a statement by striking a stylish half century, laced with seven boundaries and two sixes. Raina had been out of action after suffering a knee ligament injury. However, his captain Virender Sehwag, who has been out of the squad, failed to get his act right. Sehwag began cautiously, but was caught in the covers by S. Badrinath of Praveen Kumar. Sehwag, who opened with Maharashtra teenager Ajinkya Rahane, once again failed with the bat. The former India opener made just nine runs off 19 balls before becoming the second victim of Uttar Pradesh mediumpacer Praveen Kumar. Earlier, Praveen bowled Rahane (0) on the very first ball of the match. Praveen went on to pick the wickets of Dinesh Karthik (0) and Ramesh Powar (21) to finish with figures of four for 42 in 10 overs. Siddarth Trivedi with three wickets was the other successful bowler for India Red. Raina hit 92 off just 100 balls (2x6, 7x4) to rescue India Blue.  (AGENCIES)

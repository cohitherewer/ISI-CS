 England stumble, FA sacks McClaren
DAVID BOND amp; GILES MOLE  Steve McClaren Steve McClarens reign as England manager came to an end after failure to qualify for the Euro 2008 Championships next summer. Members of the Football Association (FA) executive board decided on Thursday morning that McClarens brief but disastrous reign as England manager needed to be brought swiftly to a close. Directors on the 12-man board discussed their next move in the aftermath of Englands 2-3 defeat by Croatia at Wembley on Wednesday. But they agreed to wait until Thursday morning before making a final decision. McClaren said after the game that he would not resign, even though defeat confirmed Englands absence from a major tournament for the first time since the World Cup in the US in 1994. But his survival in the post he has held since last August was always likely to end. With two years left on his contract he is expected to receive a 2.5 million pay-off. FA chairman Geoff Thompson said: We have unanimously decided to terminate the contract of Steve McClaren with immediate effect and we have terminated the contract of the assistant coach Terry Venables. There will be a full examination of the whole England set-up and the chief executive (Brian Barwick) will pick a new head coach. There is no definite time frame for this. We are all bitterly disappointed. We have no divine right to play in major tournaments but it is quite right that qualification is expected. McClarens commitment to the job cannot be questioned but our recruitment process begins now. Barwick quickly realised the need to make a decision directly after the final whistle at Wembley as McClarens players were greeted with boos from the angry Wembley crowd. Barwick is understood to have turned to Thompson after the game and said: Geoffrey, I think we need to have that meeting. Despite Englands stuttering form during the Euro 2008 qualification campaign, which included an away defeat to Croatia and draws against Israel away and Macedonia at home, the FA insisted they would give McClaren until the end of the competition. Wednesday night, however, his time ran out. Barwick said: The decision was unanimous. Steve and I had a grown up discussion and in the end we both agreed that not qualifying for Euro 2008 comes up short. Agencies add: McClaren took full responsibility on Thursday for Englands failure, saying his sacking was the saddest day of his career. Its a huge disappointment, he told reporters at a news conference.I feel Ive left the fans down and the country down. I really thought we were ready but sadly it wasnt to be. I said 18 months ago when I took over it was the proudest day of my career, this is the saddest.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

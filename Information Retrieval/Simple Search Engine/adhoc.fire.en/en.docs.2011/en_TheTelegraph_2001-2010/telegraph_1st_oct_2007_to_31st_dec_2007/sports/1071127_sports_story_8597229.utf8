OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: The BCCI is unlikely to hold a meeting to select the coach for the Indian team. BBCI secretary Niranjan Shah said here on Monday that a teleconference could be enough to select the coach. There is no need to hold a meeting for it. The selection committee members can discuss it over the phone and take a decision. Shah said a total of 20-22 coaches have applied for the job but refused to divulge the names. Asked whether the coach would be an Indian or a foreigner, Shah said: We are going with an open mind. The BCCI secretary made it clear that no other candidate, who is not in the list would be called. We dont want to give undue importance to anyone, he said.

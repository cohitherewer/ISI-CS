 Jaitley, Bindra to look into Dilips compensation
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has asked two of its senior members to look into the matter of compensating chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar after he agreed to stop writing his newspaper columns. Speaking to The Telegraph on Friday, BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla said: A final decision in this regard will only be taken during the India-Pakistan Calcutta Test on December 1. Vengsarkar has acceded to our request to stop writing for newspapers. At the same time he told the board president (Sharad Pawar) that since he earns his livelihood by writing columns, the board should also consider compensating him for the loss. Shukla said DDCA president Arun Jaitley and senior board member I.S. Bindra of the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) have been entrusted with the job of looking into the matter. They will submit a report and the BCCI will then take a decision.

Q Sachin Tendulkar has been getting out in the 90s so often now. Where is he going wrong? Is he plain nervous? A I have no doubt that he will keep getting runs and keep getting centuries... Hes done that before and Im sure its only a minor hiccup in his progress... I dont think theres any advice I can give that hes not already receiving.

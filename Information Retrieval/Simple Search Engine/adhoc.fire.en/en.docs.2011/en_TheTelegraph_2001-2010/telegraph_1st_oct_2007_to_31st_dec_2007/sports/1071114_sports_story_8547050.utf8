 CRICKET BRIEFS 
Warne still sceptical of Murali Melbourne: Muttiah Muralidharan may have cleared all kinds of bio-mechanical tests to prove that his action is genuine, but his closest rival Shane Warne is not convinced and wants the Sri Lankan to be tested in a match situation. The googly comes on the cusp of Muralidharan breaking Warnes world record of 708 Test wickets. I agree with Terry Jenner (Warnes coach) that he should be tested under match conditions. Im sure he is sick of it all, but it would be well worth the exercise and hassle, Warne wrote in his column a local newspaper.SLC warns Atapattu Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) on Tuesday said it would take disciplinary action against Maravan Atapattu for describing the national selection panel as muppets headed by a joker but retained the former captain for the ongoing Test series against Australia. The SLC said the governing body was distressed and disappointed by Atapattus remarks. SLC does not wish to disrupt the ongoing tour of Australia, specially as the second Test in Hobart will commence on November 16. However, SLC is very distressed and disappointed about statements made by Atapattu on the selectors and will take disciplinary action on his return to Sri Lanka, the board said in a statement here.PCB bans umpire Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board has suspended Test umpire Riazuddin for passing unsavoury comments against board officials while supervising a match of the Australia A team which toured Pakistan in September. The PCB claims that Riazuddin was suspended after conducting an inquiry on a complaint by Daryl Foster, coach of the Australian team. However, sources said the boards version has holes because if this was the case, Foster would not have waited until mid-October to file a complaint. Riazuddin, 49, has stood in 12 Tests and 12 one-day Internationals and was also on the ICC Panel of Umpires. Raj Singh  to contest Mumbai: Former BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur, against whom a series of charges  including financial impropriety  have been levelled by the present Cricket Club of India (CCI) management, is to seek re-election of the club as president for the 15th straight year. I am going to contest the elections and am confident of being elected as the CCI president for the 15th straight year, Dungarpur said on Tuesday. Bob inquest Kingston: A Jamaican specialist who performed additional tests on stomach samples from Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer said on Monday that he found no traces of a potentially deadly pesticide. The testimony of Professor Das Gupta, chemistry department director at the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies, cast more doubt on findings by Jamaican government specialists that Woolmer had been poisoned by cypermethrin.

 Germany best in Europe, says Kaiser
		BeckenbauerBerlin: Germany have the best team in Europe and have improved considerably since the World Cup while Italy, France and England have fallen behind, former coach and captain Franz Beckenbauer said on Monday. In an interview on the German federations website, Beckenbauer said coach Joachim Loew had done a great job since taking over from Juergen Klinsmann 15 months ago and said they were among the favourites to win Euro 2008. Unbeaten in their Euro 2008 qualifiers, Germany were the first team to earn a spot in the finals with a 0-0 draw against Ireland on Saturday. Germany are the best and most consistent team in Europe right now, said the 62-year-old Beckenbauer ahead of Wednesdays match against the Czech Republic in Munich. In the past, he was often among the teams most vocal critics. Theyve kept a high level since the World Cup and have even improved upon it. Other top teams like Italy, France or England have let up and are having a lot of problems even qualifying, he said, adding he believed they would nevertheless qualify. Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as West Germany captain in 1974 and coach in 1990, said he hoped Loew would extend his two-year contract soon. Germany have won 12 of 15 matches under Loew with two draws and one defeat  in a friendly against Denmark. The team have taken a big step forward and theyre ready to win the championship, said Beckenbauer. Itd be good if he stays longer. At the moment there isnt anyone better than him with his system and his assistants. Meanwhile, German coach Joachim Loew will have injury doubt Bastian Schweinsteiger in his line-up for the showdown for first place in Euro 2008 qualifying group D against the Czech Republic in Munich on Wednesday. But he will be missing injured captain Michael Ballack, suspended goalkeeper Jens Lehmann and other leading players. He will also have to counter complacency after Germany became the first team to qualify for the Euro 2008 finals with Saturdays 0-0 draw in Ireland. (REUTERS)

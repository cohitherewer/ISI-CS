 Karun test drives for Red Bull
 Karun Chandhok during his test drive for Red Bull in Barcelona on Wednesday London: Indias Karun Chandhok had his first Formula One test drive on Tuesday. Red Bull had the promising young Indian, a race winner in the GP2 support series this year, in their Renault-powered car. He completed 39 laps and was 18th out of the 20 drivers present. For me, its a huge thing  for any driver Formula One is the ultimate ambition, the 23-year-old said. To have your first Formula One test you know, gets my foot in the door and allows me a chance to see how its really like at the pinnacle of the sport. He shrugged off comparisons with compatriot Narain Karthikeyan, who became the first Indian to drive in Formula One when he raced for Jordan in 2005. Of course people in India will always compare but I just do what I have to do, I have my own career, said Chandhok. At the moment its on the way up for me  Im here today testing a Formula One for the first time and thats all I really care about. Force India, formerly Spyker, tested with Dutchman Giedo van der Garde and Spaniard Roldan Rodriguez propping up the timesheets in 19th and 20th places, respectively. Also on Tuesday, seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap in testing for Ferrari at Barcelonas Circuit de Catalunya. The 38-year-old German has no intention of returning to Formula One racing after quitting at the end of 2006 however. Champions Ferrari have described the test as half for pleasure, half for technical reasons. Formula Ones rules are changing next year, with traction control and other so-called driver aids being removed, and Schumacher can give useful input as a driver who has raced cars with and without the systems. Schumacher topped the unofficial timesheets, completing 64 laps in the F2007 car with a fastest lap of 1:21.922 seconds. The circuit website said 3,000 spectators attended the session. (REUTERS)

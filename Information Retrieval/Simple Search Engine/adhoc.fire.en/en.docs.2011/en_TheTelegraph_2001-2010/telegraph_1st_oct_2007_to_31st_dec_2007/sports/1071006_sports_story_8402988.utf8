 SA ride Steyn fiver to thumping win
 Dale Steyn after taking a wicket on Friday Karachi: Pacer Dale Steyn took five wickets to lead South Africa to a thumping 160-run win over Pakistan just before tea on the final day of the first Test at the National stadium on Friday. Pakistan were bowled out for 263, chasing an improbable victory target of 424 runs with captain Shoaib Malik the last man out after an obdurate 30 runs from 99 balls. Steyn, playing in his 12th Test, took his third five-wicket haul when he finished with five for 56. This was South Africas eighth victory in 15 matches against the hosts and only their second on Pakistan soil. They last won in Faisalabad in 1997. Pakistan suffered just their second defeat at the National stadium venue in 40 Tests. The Pakistan innings was wrapped up just before tea despite a blazing hundred from Younis Khan who hit his 13th Test hundred and his first against South Africa.  (REUTERS)

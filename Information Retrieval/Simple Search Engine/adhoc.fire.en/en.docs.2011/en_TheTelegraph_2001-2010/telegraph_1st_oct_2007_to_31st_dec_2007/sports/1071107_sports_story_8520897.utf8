 Bagan snuff out EB hopes
A STAFF REPORTER 			Jose Ramirez Barreto gives a thumbs up while Bhaichung Bhutia is all smiles after beating East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. Picture by Gautam Bose		Calcutta: Mohun Bagan virtually laid their hands on the Sahara CFL Premier Division trophy, beating arch-rivals East Bengal in the second leg too, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. Jose Ramirez Barreto gave the green-and-maroon fans a Diwali gift in advance, scoring both goals in the 2-0 win. With two matches to go, Mohun Bagan, with 30 points, have opened up a five-point lead over Subrata Bhattacharyas side. The title is now only theirs to lose since they also have a better goal difference and all Barretos team needs is a point from their next two matches. The second-leg derby might not have been as dramatic as the 4-3 thriller at the same venue on August 17, but it had all the ingredients that make an East Bengal-Mohun Bagan encounter so special. There were East Bengals ferocious attacks in the first-half, Mohun Bagan midfields transformation from the struggling to the scintillating with the passage of time and concomitant to these were some individual sparks. Two incidents on either side of the break eventually stood out as the key moments of the match. The first took place in the 37th minute, when both Barreto and Surkumar Singh went up for an aerial challenge. The East Bengal defender fell and went out of the ground with a head injury, leaving the backline exposed to the lethal stings of Barreto and Bhaichung Bhutia. Then five minutes after the breather, Barreto cast his spell on the match. Alvito DCunha  who didnt shine as bright as he had promised to do on the match-eve  gave away the ball to Dharamjit Singh around the central park. The Bagan midfielder promptly sent it in the direction of an onrushing Barreto. From there started the Brazilians magical journey. He sprinted like a panther, sensing hes well within his target. On approaching the rival box, he met M. Suresh in his way but easily took the challenger in his stride. Then he waltzed with the ball over a few yards further, before unleashing a lethal left-footer which beat Subrata Paul all ends up. Spotless and dazzling. As East Bengal upped their ante in search of an equaliser, their fort was also in danger of being under siege from quick counter-attacks. Thats exactly what happened in the closing minutes of the match, when Bhaichung had a free run following a Habibur Rahman through. Only a Paul lunge could stop him, forcing referee M. Suresh to point to the spot-kick. Barreto was, once again, spotless in converting the penalty, sending East Bengal fans into the darkness of despair three days before the festival of light. The summit meeting had flickered into life right from the word go. Within the first four minutes, Edmilson and Ashim Biswas wasted a couple of chances as the red-and-golds made their intention clear, leaving Mohun Bagan on the backfoot and gasping. But first Surkumars departure and next his replacement Soumik Deys injury, seriously affected the midfields industry, forcing Bhattacharya to make two side-halves fall back to attend to the backline needs. Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira, on the other hand, reshuffled his middle-third after the half time, putting Douglas da Silva as a defensive screen against the ambitious East Bengal side. The move paid off, with N.S. Manju beating Edmilson in the air time and again and Douglas keeping a close tab on Ashim and Alvito in and around the half-line. And when their protection in the Mohun Bagan defence was breached, Shilton Paul was exceptional under the bar. The way he flung himself acrobatically to save Edmilsons shot from close would surely have made Englands former World Cup goalkeeper (after whom the 20-year-old was named) proud. Teams Mohun Bagan: Shilton Paul; Habibur Rahman, Sanjeev Maria, N.S. Manju, Subhashish Roy Chowdhury; Douglas da Silva, James Singh (Anit Ghosh, 90), Dharamjit Singh, S. Venkatesh (Lalkamal Bhowmick, 65); Jose Ramirez Barreto, Bhaichung Bhutia. East Bengal: Subrata Paul; Surkumar Singh (Soumik Dey, 37, Dipankar Roy 70), M. Bolaji, M. Suresh, Debabrata Roy; Syed Rahim Nabi, Jayanta Sen, Mehrajuddin Wadao, Alvito DCunha (Dipendu Biswas, 79); Edmilson, Ashim Biswas. Referee: M. Suresh.

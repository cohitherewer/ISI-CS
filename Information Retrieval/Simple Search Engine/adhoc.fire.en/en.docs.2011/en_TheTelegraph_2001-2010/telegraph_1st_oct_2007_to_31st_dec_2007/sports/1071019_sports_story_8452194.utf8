 Tough but not beyond reach: Bob 
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Bob Houghton New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton is confident that India still have a chance to make a comeback against Lebanon, despite the 1-4 defeat in Beirut. India will take on the Gulf rivals in Chennai on October 28. Speaking from Goa on Thursday, Houghton said: Securing a 3-0 win, especially against Lebanon, will be tough, but it is certainly not beyond our reach. We believe we can do it. The British coach, however, refused to accept that Lebanon had burst the Nehru Cup bubble in the World Cup qualifier and showed full faith in his boys. According to him, the same set of boys may make a turnaround and deliver the goods in Chennai despite being outpaced and outsmarted by the Lebanese in Beirut. I dont see any reason to change this batch of players, Houghton said after two days of practice session in Goa . Only 13 players showed up on Day I, but Houghton made it clear that no excuses would be tolerated if players  who have been granted leave due to religious festivities and other reasons  failed to turn up. Houghton said that given an option, he would have preferred to play the home match in New Delhi, where India won the Nehru Cup recently. The big crowd that was there at the Ambedkar Stadium, got the best out of players, he said. Its a pity that the match is not being played in Delhi. We can certainly do it in Chennai, but for that we need to play at our real best. The crowd too will be a factor. We need everyone to rally behind the team like they did in Delhi, Houghton said.

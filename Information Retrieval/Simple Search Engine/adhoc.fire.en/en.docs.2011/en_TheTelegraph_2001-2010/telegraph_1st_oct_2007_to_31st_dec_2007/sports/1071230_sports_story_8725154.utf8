 West Ham stun United 

 Manchester Uniteds Cristiano Ronaldo leaves the field after the 1-2 loss. He scored the teams lone goal but missed a penalty 
London: Manchester United lost 1-2 at West Ham United Saturday and allowed Chelsea to gain ground by beating Newcastle United by the same score with a controversial late goal from Salomon Kalou at Stamford Bridge. 
Until last season, Manchester United had never lost in the Premier League at Upton Park but the Londoners, who also triumphed at Old Trafford in May, made it two in two seasons with late goals by defenders Anton Ferdinand and Matthew Upson. 
United still lead the way on 45 points but Arsenal, on 44, can go above them if they win at Everton. Chelsea are third on 41. Liverpool, fourth on 36 and fifth-placed Manchester City (35) meet at Eastlands on Sunday. 
The game of the day was at White Hart Lane where Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov scored four as Tottenham Hotspur beat Reading 6-4 with seven goals coming in a crazy 20-minute second-half spell. 
It was the second time this season that Reading had scored four away from home and lost following their 4-7 defeat at Portsmouth in September. 
Across London, Manchester United took the lead when Ryan Giggs crossed for Cristiano Ronaldo to head his 18th of the season after 14 minutes. 
The Portuguese winger should have settled it from the spot in the 66th after a Jonathan Spector handball but shot wide. 
West Ham, who had always been in the game, equalised with a header by Ferdinand, brother of Uniteds Rio, after a 77th minute corner and won it eight minutes from the end with Upsons header from a free kick. 
Chelsea, without a host of first-choice players through injury and suspension, also struggled for long spells against Newcastle despite Michael Essien putting them ahead after 29 minutes. 
Nicky Butt scrambled a 56th-minute equaliser but Newcastle were left down and out after Kalou, who seemed clearly offside, got the winner three minutes from the end.

 Captain lauds seniors
- False hostility or not, Team India pull one back in Chandigarh...
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT			Team India celebrate their win over Australia in Chandigarh on Monday. (AFP)		Chandigarh: Chairman of the selection committee Dilip Vengsarkar might have made some remarks about the senior players, but skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Monday heaped praises on the ageing stalwarts. Moments after defeating Australia by eight runs in the fourth one-day International, Dhoni said it would have been impossible to win without Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar and their 91-run opening wicket partnership. Both Sachin and Sourav batted in a great manner, said Dhoni. Without them, we would not have won the match. Dhoni did not agree with the suggestion that Sachin should have scored faster. Because of them the Indian innings got the solidity It needed badly at that time. It was not easy to play on this wicket. The Aussies were bowling extremely well early in our innings. The Jharkhand cricketer said the experienced cricketers were playing extremely well. No one wants them out. All we need is to groom the junior cricketers, who would come up in future. It is a process. It cannot be achieved by throwing out someone. There was no turning point in the match as such. It was achieved in bits and pieces and through a total team effort. Every over mattered and we slowly inched towards victory. At no point was I afraid of losing the match. Murali Kartiks fine bowling at the fag end came as a huge relief for Dhoni. Kartik was simply brilliant, he said. I was the one who wanted him in. Had he not done well, I would have been at the receiving end. On his first win as ODI skipper, Dhoni said: It is only the beginning But there are many more to come. We are on the right track and the series is wide open. Dhonis Australian counterpart, Ricky Ponting, thought his team lost the battle in the crucial stage. We lost crucial wickets and gave away too many runs as extras.

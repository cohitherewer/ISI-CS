 Malik quietly confident
-Young Turk dares Pakistani spearhead; Younis confirmed vice-captain 
Lahore: Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik Wednesday vowed to make up for the disappointing home series loss to South Africa by winning the series against their arch-rivals. We know people are disappointed at the way we lost the final one-dayer to South Africa and also the series. But we also know a repeat performance against India will not be acceptable to the people, Malik said a day before leaving for Delhi. We all felt bad at the way we had gifted the match to South Africa and we want to make amends in India. The young captain assured he had played enough international cricket to be able to handle the pressures that comes with an Indian tour. I have played against India and been there before, so I know what it is all about. I am not going to take any extra pressure on this tour. We had a brain storming session yesterday (Tuesday) and we all know that whether we play India or any other team we have to give our best, he said. Dispelling the impression that his team could not handle the pressure in the big matches, the skipper said: Look we handled the pressure games in the ICC World Twenty20. The final was a close affair and it could have gone either way, Malik said. Even against South Africa, we came back to level the series 2-2 but lost the final because of irresponsible and poor cricket. I am confident my players can handle the pressure well in India. Pakistan have picked a 16-member squad for the five ODIs. The squad includes three openers, Imran Nazir, Salman Butt and Yasir Hameed with Shahid Afridi and Kamran Akmal also having opened against South Africa. Malik conceded the form of openers would be the key to the performance in India. If the openers do well we have the depth in our middle and lower order to get big scores. I am counting that since the pitches are similar in Pakistan and India the openers will settle down quickly and get the runs. Malik said if required even he was not shy of opening and would bat at any position for his team. As expected, Younis Khan has been named vice-captain for the tour. Afridi, meanwhile, has accepted responsibility for Pakistans defeat to South Africa in the final ODI in Lahore, describing his reckless dismissal as a nightmare. I couldnt sleep for the whole night thinking about the stroke I had played. I kept on thinking if I had not played that stroke, we could have won the match and the series, Afridi said on Wednesday. Pakistan lost the final match by 14 runs with Afridi getting dismissed for nine attempting to hit an overboundary. Afridi, however, promised to make amends in India. I think we need to learn from our mistakes as a team also and perform well in India. If we repeat the same mistakes against India I have a feeling a lot of people will pay the price for defeat, he said. He pointed out that people never forgot or forgave a poor performance against India, especially if the players had not tried hard enough. I have played against India a number of times and I know the expectations are very high from our people. They dont like to see us lose against India in the manner we lost to South Africa, he added.

 Dhoni defends Dravid move
OUR CORRESPONDENTNagpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Sunday tried to defend his strategy of sending Irfan Pathan at No. 3 and Rahul Dravid at No. 4 in a flimsy manner. He (Dravid) was padded up for a long time So decided to send him then. He has been going through a tough time but it happens with all batsmen including Sachin He hasnt been getting enough time to settle down. Its not a major issue. Every time when someone has been promoted and has failed this question crops up The move also left Ricky Ponting surprised. I was a little bit surprised You always try and get your batsmen in at important positions. Thats the way we look at it. Why didnt Dhoni himself bat at No. 3 considering that he has scored runs in the past in that position? I need to practice more playing at that position. Havent batted at that spot for a long while. Im practising now and may be in the next series I could try myself there provided someone can fill my role at No. 6 Its quite tough to bat at all positions, the Indian captain said. Dhoni was quick to list the causes of the defeat. We dropped a couple of catches and our bowling wasnt good in the death overs. We lost a couple of wickets at the wrong time. Sachin and Sourav got out at a time when we would have liked them to go on and we never got any partnerships thereafter. The asking rate was always high and it was difficult for a batsman who had just come in to score at that rate. I think we never performed well in all three aspects of the game. The only time we did well was in Chandigarh, when we excelled in all aspects, and the result was in our favour, Dhoni said. Ponting was basking in the glory of the series victory. This series has been a good contest and today was really good one. We got the wickets when we needed them. The game can change very quickly in this part of the world A win shouldnt be underestimated. Today we kept partnerships going and Andrew Symonds played a really sensible innings. I think his innings was the defining moment. He has been confident and has been a changed player from what he was five-six years ago. He is well prepared and adapts quickly to any situation. Man of the Match Symonds said: If you look at our innings, wickets fell at times when ideally we didnt want them to fall, and this meant I had to knuckle down a bit and help build a big total. It was a special innings and I really feel proud about it..

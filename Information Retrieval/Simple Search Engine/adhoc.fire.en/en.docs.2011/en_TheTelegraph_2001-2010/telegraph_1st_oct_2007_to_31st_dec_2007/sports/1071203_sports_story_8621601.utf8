 Bedi: Bhajji too chucks
Melbourne: After criticising Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan as a chucker, former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi has pulled up Harbhajan Singh, saying he is no different. Bedi also lashed out at the ICC for turning a blind eye to this (chucking) problem. He (Harbhajan) is no different. The ICC is turning a blind eye to both of them. They are blind to this monstrous problem and it is unfair and undesirable, Bedi said. It is not something to be ignored. A lot of people have questioned Harbhajans action and they are right too. He has the same problem as Muralidharan, the former India left-arm spinner was quoted as saying in a local newspaper on Sunday. And young bowlers on the subcontinent are coming through and are copying the actions of Harbhajan and Muralidharan. These boys will be Test cricketers one day and the ICC is going to have a hell of a problem. (PTI)

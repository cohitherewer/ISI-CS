(AP) Jakarta: Indias Gaganjeet Bhullar was pipped to the post by Juvic Pagunsan of the Philippines who claimed his maiden title at the Indonesia President Invitational on Sunday. Bhullar carded a final round 69 but it was not enough as the 29-year-old Pagunsan produced a card of 65 to emerge best at the Damai Indah golf course with a winning aggregate of 19-under-par 269. Bhullar led by two strokes, but with three holes to play, Pagunsan produced a stunning finish, striking a birdie on the 17th and an eagle on the 18th hole to walk away with the winners cheque of $ 55,475. Pagunsan, who shot a 71 in the third round, was three strokes off the pace heading into the final round but four birdies on the front nine set him on the right path. Pagunsan, the Asian Tours rookie of the year in 2006, chalked up his fifth birdie of the day on the 13th hole before a dropped shot on the 15th. With five birdies against two bogeys, Bhullar was ahead of Pagunsan and completed his round with a one stroke lead before the eagle by the Filipino ended the Indians chances of a maiden win in his rookie season. Among other Indians, Harmeet Kahlon, who was just one shot off the pace at one stage, finished tied fifth with a final round 69 and Digvijay Singh tied 14th after carding a 70. (PTI)

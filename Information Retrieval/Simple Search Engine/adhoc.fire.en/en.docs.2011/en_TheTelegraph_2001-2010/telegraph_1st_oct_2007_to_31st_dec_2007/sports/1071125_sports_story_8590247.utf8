 Klinsmann is Kaisers pick 
DAVID BOND IN DURBAN Franz Beckenbauer As several leading figures pulled out of the running for the England managers job, Franz Beckenbauer has urged the Football Association to turn to his German compatriot, Jurgen Klinsmann, to replace Steve McClaren. Beckenbauer said Klinsmann would rouse the nations footballers from their coma following their failure to qualify for Euro 2008. Klinsmann has been a free agent since the last World Cup when he guided an unfancied German team to the semi-finals. He has an intricate knowledge of the English game from his time as a Tottenham player and has invaluable experience as a World Cup winner in 1990. His refusal to relocate from his California home caused him problems while Germany manager, however, and that could also be an obstacle for the FA. But Beckenbauer said: Who can carry the boys with the three lions on their shirt out of their coma? One name comes to my mind immediately: Jurgen Klinsmann. For him the England job would be ideal, and also for England. A day after the FA promised a root and branch review of the national team, Beckenbauer was one of two of the most powerful figures in world football to attack the English game over its reliance on imports. As England were dealt another blow with confirmation that they had been placed among the second seeds in the 2010 World Cup draw, Beckenbauer and Fifa president Sepp Blatter reopened the debate on the Premier Leagues foreign invasion. Beckenbauer said: The motherland of football should have been a part of it (Euro 2008). Whats going wrong? Is the Premier League only booming because there are so many foreign players?THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

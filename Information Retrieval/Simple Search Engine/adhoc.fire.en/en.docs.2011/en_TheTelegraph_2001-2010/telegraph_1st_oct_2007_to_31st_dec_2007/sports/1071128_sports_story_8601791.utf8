 Dravid happy to be back
A STAFF REPORTER Rahul Dravid in the city on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: The last time Rahul Dravid played at the Eden  against Pakistan in 2004-05  he came up with two centuries and was adjudged Man of the Match. For somebody who scored his maiden first class hundred at Eden Gardens (against Bengal in 1990-91) and averages 65.41 from seven Test appearances here, the venue is expectedly very close to his heart. My love affair with the Eden started in 1990-91 when I scored my maiden first class century against Bengal. Since then it has continued. Its one of the best venues Nowhere else do you bat with 100000 people watching you. Its a different feeling, the former Indian skipper said during a function at the Behala College ground on Tuesday. Dravid was talking to National James School children during an exhibition by photojournalist Suman Chattopadhyay. The 34-year-old hopes to carry on his good form. I see it (the second Test at the Eden) as an opportunity to showcase my skill and Im looking forward to it. I hope its a sporting track and we witness a good five days of cricket. He went on to add that Eden had given him the brightest moment in his career. Beating Australia here, especially after we were following on was the brightest moment of my career Laxman and I batted really well. The win was very special, more so since we stopped Australias 16-match unbeaten run. Dravid (180) and Laxman (281) had shared a 376-run fifth wicket partnership in the second innings to power India to a 171-run win in March 2001. On how does he excel so well under pressure, Dravid said: I love challenges Love to be challenged. There has to be a certain hunger, an amount of desire in you You should learn to enjoy the situation under pressure He added that hes not concerned about records. Having played so many matches, Im not worried about any personal milestone, centuries Its more about contributing to the teams cause. See the opposition as an opportunity but not a threat. Say, for example, if you see the examination as an opportunity to do well in your career, youll excel but if you see it as a threat youll fail Dravid said to the kids. The former India captain said parents were his source of inspiration. They showed me a lot of Ranji matches Kapil Dev, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath  the three great Indian cricketers  were my idol. In fact, watching India lift the 1983 World Cup was a huge source of inspiration His advice for youngsters taking up cricket was to love the game.

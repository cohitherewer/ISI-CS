 Sreesanth message for Ian
Melbourne: Unfazed by Ian Chappells sharp criticism of his on-field behaviour in the ongoing India-Australia one-day series, pacer Sreesanth has said he did not need a ban to improve his conduct as suggested by the former Australian skipper. I feel I am okay. I feel Ian should really look at the video of the last few games. I dont need a ban, Sreesanth was quoted as saying in an Australian daily. I am not bothered, but I do respect Ian Chappell. I loved the way he played the game. However, I do not need a break. If there is change from me, it will be for good, the mercurial bowler quipped. Sreesanth drew flak for his aggressive behaviour in the series, which became all the more harsh after he failed to make much impact with the ball. Chappell, in his column, said the speedster was an accident waiting to happen. Sreesanth said he was trying to find the balance between good and bad behaviour. I can learn. Im grown up enough to realise how to play cricket. I love the game. Its not a new Sreesanth. I am trying to find that exact limit between really bad and really good. See how far I can go, he said. Sreesanth said Indians would prefer to remain quiet after having lost the series. Even if we win the next game, the series still belongs to Australia, so its a time they can say anything. Its a time for us to keep quiet and hopefully we can defeat them in Australia. Its cricket, you never know. Weve got four matches there and you never know, we might win 4-0, he said.  (PTI)

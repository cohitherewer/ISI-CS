 Selectors upset, but not quitting
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: The national selectors are upset with some of the decisions recently taken by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), but none has threatened to resign as was the talk late on Monday. Dilip Vengsarkar, it appears, is particularly unhappy as he has been forbidden not only from writing columns but also from interacting with the media as chairman of the selection committee. It is possible that the selectors could make a representation to BCCI president Sharad Pawar in the next few days expressing their unhappiness over certain issues. The instructions from the Board to the selectors are:  No selector will speak to the media and no more than one selector will be present during an international match at home.  The selectors cannot travel abroad for matches and will not be allowed to go to the dressing room when the match is on.  The selectors cannot associate themselves with players agents or any business group that have a vested interest in cricket.  The selectors must watch more domestic matches. The Telegraph, it may be recalled had on Sunday quoted a confidant of Vengsarkar as saying that he was extremely cut up with the Boards double standards. Dilip feels the BCCI should also bar technical committee chairman Sunil Gavaskar and the National Cricket Academy chairman, Ravi Shastri, from writing columns... Hes doing an honorary job and the Board cant deprive him of his livelihood. Vengsarkar has stopped syndicating columns in English after a BCCI directive, but continues to write in a leading Marathi newspaper. Niranjan Shah said that the BCCI hasnt heard from the selectors. A message has been sent to the selectors not to write columns. The selectors havent spoken to the BCCI Its the BCCIs policy and everyone has to abide by it, the secretary said. It may be noted that four of the five selectors, except Venkatapathi Raju, are office bearers of their respective state associations.

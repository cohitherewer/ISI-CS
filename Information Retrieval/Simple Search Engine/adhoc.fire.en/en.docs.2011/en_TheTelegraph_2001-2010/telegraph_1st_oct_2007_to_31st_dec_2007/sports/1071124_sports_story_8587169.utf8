				 Time the Big Two made their presence felt
				 - I-League kicks off today with a lot of promise but new rule on foreigners is hardly welcome 
FREE-KICK 
 PK BanerjeeThe National League is all set to unfold in its new avatar, the I-League. The 10-team championship will see several changes, most of which have been designed to expedite the process of complete professionalism. The new rule on foreigners, however, is hardly a welcome move.																								The I-League teams can register four foreign players and play three of them. Thirty per cent of every team comprising imported manpower means lesser scope for homegrown players. Thats not what the doctor ordered for Indian football.																								The influence of foreign players on our club football is already quite pronounced. If anyone had a doubt, a quick glance at the NFL stats will clear it. Bhaichung and Raman Vijayan topped the scorers list in the first two editions, but in the next nine, overseas strikers have monopolised that honour.																								That doesnt reflect well on the quality of desi strikers. But isnt that all the more reason that they should be encouraged? If every team is packed with two foreign attackers, what happens to the likes of Dipendu Biswas, Ashim Biswas, Sunil Chhetri? Not only is their exposure very limited, their confidence takes a serious beating as well.																								Three foreigners per team was bad enough, an extra one in the premier club competition wont do Indian football any good.																								Getting back to the I-League, this will be a big year for Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. The Calcutta heavyweights won six of the first eight competitions (thrice each) but have been denied glory the last three seasons, when Dempo triumphed twice and Mahindra once. Its time the Big Two made their presence felt once again.																								Both have some problems to address, especially in defence where they need a big-built stopper. Otherwise, I think both can be serious title contenders. East Bengal, under Subrata Bhattacharya, showed by winning the Federation Cup that they are hungry. Mohun Bagan, too, should be confident after winning the CFL Premier Division crown.																								Mohun Bagan have a set of gifted midfielders, but their fortunes will revolve round the form of Barreto and Bhaichung. The Brazilian has already served notice by emerging as the highest scorer in the Premier league, while Bhaichung has been playing well for the national team. Both, I feel, have two good years left in them and will be eager to explode on the biggest stage of Indian football.																								One sound move by Mohun Bagan was roping in Douglas da Silva. The robust Brazilian will come in handy in tough matches where the defence will come under severe pressure.																								The key men in the East Bengal campaign will be Edmilson, Alvito DCunha and Surkumar. Edmilson has been a prolific scorer and had a neck-and-neck battle with Barreto in the local league. The red-and-golds will be hoping the Brazilian retains his scoring touch throughout the marathon competition.																								Coach Subrata will also be banking on Alvitos game-making skills. His left foot has to deliver telling passes for the likes of Edmilson to pounce on.																								Dempo, Mahindra and Sporting Clube de Goa will be the ones to challenge the Big Two in their pursuit for the summit. Dempo have retained the fulcrum of the side which emerged champions last year and even consolidated their roster with the inclusion of Mahesh Gawli and Chidi Edeh. The form of Ranty Martins, who took over the mantle from striker Junior since the Brazilians tragic death three years, will be important.																								Mahindra lost a number of star players in the transfers this season but still have an efficient unit.																								Sporting Clube have come close to winning the coveted title twice and will be determined to make this the breakthrough season.																								The key for the Calcutta clubs will be to make sure that the injuries are minimised. They cant afford to have their key men missing too many games, whatever the bench strength.

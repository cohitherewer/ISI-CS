 Milan, Liverpool bite dust  - Chelsea back on track 
JOHN LEY in Valencia Chelsea captain John Terry, wearing a protective mask, directs his players against Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia on Wednesday, while Liverpools Yossi Benayoun reacts after the loss to Marseille at Anfield. (AP/AFP) John Terry wore a mask and Chelsea succeeded in disguising their recent failings by securing a remarkable victory on a balmy Spanish night in the Mestalla. A victory inspired, not for the first time in this imposing stadium, by Joe Cole took Chelsea to the top of Group B. Crisis? Surely not? Six months ago Jose Mourinhos Chelsea came to Spain and left with an impressive 2-1 victory to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League. Given the turmoil that has followed Chelsea so far this season, the repeat success was arguably a greater achievement  a view echoed by Terry. I think it was, he said. We fought back and came right back into the game. It was certainly a personal accomplishment for Avram Grant, the man ordered to pick up the pieces from the fall-out created by Mourinhos departure. It may not be enough, yet, to erase the memories of Mourinho  indeed, they will remain ingrained in the history of the club  but in terms of signalling a new era, this victory will serve as inspiration. How Roman Abramovich must have delighted in this improbable success. Despite a barren time, Grant has stood by his players and they responded splendidly, with Cole scoring the equaliser and then supplying the pass of the season for Didier Drogba to collect a 71st-minute winner. For Grant, the game was a huge test and he did not shy away from making potentially immense decisions. Terry returned just four days after fracturing his cheekbone, while Andrei Shevchenko and Juliano Belletti were dropped to the bench. In one fell swoop, Grant had not only dispensed with the services of two Champions League winners, but two men who had scored winning goals in the final. Shevchenko, the second-highest goalscorer in European football, claimed the winner for AC Milan in 2003, while Belletti broke Arsenal hearts with the late winner for Barcelona three years later. Terry started off the pace but improved and, towards the end as Valencia launched a wave of desperate attempts to steal a point, he was thrusting his protected head where others would not venture. Grants only previous win came at Hull, so confidence was not what it might have been. If David Silvas shot wide after just 39 seconds was a warning, Valencia confirmed their early dominance in the ninth minute. Claude Makeleles attempted clearance hit Michael Essien and ricocheted into the path of David Villa, who finished in style beyond Petr Cech. In April Chelsea were trailing 0-1 when they brought on Cole and he inspired their 2-1 win. This time Cole started and at times looked like a whippet as Chelsea searched for an opening. Ultimately, he was to win the game, the comeback beginning in the 21st minute. The build-up was like the Chelsea of old: swift and positive, with the impressive Drogba feeding Florent Malouda. His cross, from the left, was found by Cole who challenged with Emiliano Moretti. Cole got a strong touch and though it may have found the net off Moretti, the winger predictably claimed it. Chelsea continued to look unsure in defence and Villa should have regained the lead for Valencia off Ricardo Carvalhos poor clearance. Instead he sent the ball high into the stand. Before the break Chelsea had shown signs of a recovery, with a containment designed to frustrate the Spaniards but the danger signs returned when, in the 54th minute, Moretti rose at the far post to head narrowly wide. Two minutes later the defence was exposed again when both Villa and Fernando Morientes were clear. Villa, though, was offside as he beat Petr Cech, to the relief of Terry and his back-line. The game had fallen flat when, in the 71st minute, Chelsea turned it on its head with a goal outstanding both in its inception and delivery. Cole produced the most delicate touch, stealing the ball off Carlos Marchena before sending Drogba racing forward with a 50-yard delivery. The striker held off Raul Albiol before using his left foot to claim only his second goal of the season. It could prove to be his most valuable, certainly this side of Christmas.

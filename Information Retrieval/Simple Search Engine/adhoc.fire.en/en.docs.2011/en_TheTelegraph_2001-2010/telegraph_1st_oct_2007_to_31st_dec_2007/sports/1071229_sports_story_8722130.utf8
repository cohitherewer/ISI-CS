Melbourne: Michael Clarke and Phil Jaques led a dominating batting display before Australia declared their second innings with a seemingly insurmountable lead over India and two days remaining in the first Test. 
Australia declared at 351 for seven late Friday and India were 6 without loss after surviving eight overs before stumps, still needing 493 runs to win on a slow and deteriorating Melbourne Cricket Ground wicket. 
Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh took three wickets for 101 runs. while India captain Anil Kumble had two for 102. 
India  dismissed for 196 runs in reply to Australias first innings of 343  will need to make history to win the match, while Australia have six sessions to take 10 wickets on a pitch that is becoming increasingly difficult for batsmen. 
The highest successful run-chase at the MCG was Englands 332 against Australia in the 1928-29 Ashes series. Only three teams have ever completed a winning run-chase in excess of 400 runs in the fourth innings of a Test. 
The West Indies hold the Test record of 418 for seven when they beat Australia in St Johns in 2003. India had rattled up 406 for four to defeat the West Indies in Port of Spain in 1976 while Australia scored 404 for three to prevail over England at Headingley in 1948. 
Rahul Dravid (3) and Wasim Jaffer (2) will resume Indias chase on Day IV. 
Though none of the Australians raised a three-figure score, there were contributions aplenty from everyone across the chart but for captain Ricky Ponting (3) who suffered his second failure of the match. Jacques (51) and Clarke (73) were worth half-centuries but even the rest of the batters made 30s and 40s to keep Australia chugging along. 
Australia again had a good start to thank for their position in this match as Jacques and Matthew Hayden put on 83 runs for the first wicket. 
Hayden was beginning to shift gears when he fell for a lofted stroke off Harbhajan that went straight to Sourav Ganguly at long off. The mighty left-hander made 47 from 54 balls in his 84 minutes of batting, striking six fours. 
Jacques, Mike Hussey (36) and Andrew Symonds left in the session but Australia, at 248 for five, were already close to 400-run lead mark. 
Zaheer was roundly booed by Indian supporters at the MCG for the flurry of no-balls but apparently there was a reason to it. The legendary Wasim Akram had advised him to understand that his method of swinging the delivery, as he did so brilliantly in England this summer, would not work in Australia. 
It wouldnt help if he was to just come and release the delivery in Australia as he did in England. There is a different method of obtaining swing in this part of the world, Akram said. 
When you bowl with the old ball, trying to gain reverse swing, you tend to overstep, thats common I like the way he has bowled in this Test though I would like him to keep switching on either side of the wicket, lest a batsman gets used to his style of bowling, Akram said.

 Steve blames Dravid

A STAFF REPORTER
 Steve Waugh 
Calcutta: Former Australian captain Steve Waugh blamed Rahul Dravid for India surrendering the momentum in the first Test. 
Rahul Dravid looked out of touch and instead of being bold and countering with aggression, he opted for a grafting response which would have been fine if he went on to make a significant score. But to fall for five off 66 balls was to hand the momentum clearly back to Australia, Waugh wrote in his column for Melbournes Daily Telegraph. 
India would have been well pleased to bowl Australia out for 343 but immediately gave the impetus back by getting bogged down at the crease and allowing Lee and Johnson to determine the way forward. 
Much in the same mould as (Matthew) Hayden, Tendulkar appeared primed for a big innings, playing straight off the quicker bowlers and accumulating runs before setting himself for a premeditated assault on Brad Hogg where he swatted across the line and over the infield, much in the same way he took to Warne on the subcontinent. 
Waugh was all praise for Brad Hogg. With two exceptional players of spin in Ganguly and Tendulkar clearly showing their intent against Brad Hogg, the blowtorch was well and truly on, with no place to hide. 
The perceived weakness in the past was his temperament, which could falter under pressure, but on this occasion he showed a calmness and control over his emotions, culminating in Gangulys dismissal, in a display that justified his spot in the side, he wrote.

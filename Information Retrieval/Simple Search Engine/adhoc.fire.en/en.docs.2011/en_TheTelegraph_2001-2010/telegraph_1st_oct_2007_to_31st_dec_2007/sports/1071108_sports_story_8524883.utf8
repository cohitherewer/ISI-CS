 Becker to sue for custody 
Berlin: Former world No. 1 Boris Becker says he will launch a legal bid to obtain custody of his seven-year-old daughter Anna. Becker had a short liaison with the girls mother, Angela Ermakova, in 1999. The retired tennis star has two sons from his marriage with Barbara Feltus. I have a custody order for my two boys, but not unfortunately for my daughter. Believe me, I will fight for the right, Becker told a German weekly magazine which hits the stands on Thursday. It is not something I am doing for publicity, it is something I want to do for the Becker family. My daughter deserves to see her brothers and her father regularly, said the 39-year-old. Anna, who bears a striking resemblance to her father, was recently in the headlines when a company was fined for illegally using her to promote their cosmetics. Becker is said to have been furious with Ermalova over the incident. The three-time Wimbledon champion was confirmed as Annas father in 2001. (AFP)

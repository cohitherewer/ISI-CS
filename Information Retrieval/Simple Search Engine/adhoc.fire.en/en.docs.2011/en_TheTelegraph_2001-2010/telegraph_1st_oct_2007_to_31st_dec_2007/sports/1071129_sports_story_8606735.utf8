 First defeat fails to perturb Wenger
Madrid: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger did not regret his decision to field a new-look team after they slipped to their first defeat of the season in a 1-3 loss at Sevilla in the Champions League on Tuesday. However, the Frenchman strongly criticised the fourth official after being sent off 10 minutes from the end of the match for complaining about what he felt was time wasting by Sevilla captain Daniel Alves. The fourth official was very busy tonight. Ive been involved in over 100 games in the Champions League and his behaviour was absolutely shocking, Wenger told a news conference after the match at the Sanchez Pizjuan. Alves was down wasting time and when the guy (team physio) came on the pitch he stood up and two minutes later he was sprinting. I asked the referee why he sent me off and he said he would explain after the game but he couldnt give me another reason. Asked if it was a risky strategy to field a weakened team with the leadership of the group at stake, Wenger replied: Yes it was, but I dont regret it because I wanted some players to be exposed to the top level and Im happy I did that. For me an unbeaten record in the Champions League is not important, what it important is to qualify and weve got the Premier League too. Weve got a lot of big games coming up and weve got a big December. We have to make some difficult choices and for me December is based on the (Premier League) championship. Im not worried because we didnt have the usual team out. We started well but we relaxed.... They deserved to win. Sevilla coach Manolo Jimenez was delighted at how his team recovered from back-to-back losses in the league to Villarreal and Real Mallorca to end Arsenals unbeaten record and wrest the leadership of group H from the English side.

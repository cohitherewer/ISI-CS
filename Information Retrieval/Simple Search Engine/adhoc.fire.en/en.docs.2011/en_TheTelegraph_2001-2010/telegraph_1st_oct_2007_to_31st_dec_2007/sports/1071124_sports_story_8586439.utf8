 I want to keep playing like this: Laxman
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: V.V.S. Laxman rescued India on Friday with an unbeaten knock of 57 but the real battle, he said, will only be fought on Saturday morning. Talking to reporters at the end of Day II, Laxman said the morning session of the third day could decide the fate of the Test match. Tomorrows morning session will be very crucial. The ball is still moving and the Pakistan bowlers are bowling well, said Laxman. I am happy that I could put on a good partnership with Dhoni. I was playing to the merit of the ball. It was also good to see Dhoni play that way. It would have been better if he (Dhoni) had stayed till the end of the day, said Laxman. About his own innings Laxman said: The situation was tense but I have always wanted to perform under such conditions, when the team wants you. I just want to continue playing like this. There is always a bit of challenge involved Actually we lost too many wickets in the middle overs. Their bowlers also bowled very well, he said. Laxman was full of praise for debutant Sohail Tanveer who picked up the crucial wickets of Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid. Adjusting to Sohails style of bowling was difficult but facing him was easy. But I think Shoaib bowled the best, said Laxman. Asked to comment on why he has not been considered for the one-day matches, the Hyder- abad batsman said: I dont think about things over which I have no control. I am quite happy with the way I played in England. I am sure the team management has taken note of it. As a cricketer I have proved myself time and again. If people still have doubts about my ability, I cannot help it.

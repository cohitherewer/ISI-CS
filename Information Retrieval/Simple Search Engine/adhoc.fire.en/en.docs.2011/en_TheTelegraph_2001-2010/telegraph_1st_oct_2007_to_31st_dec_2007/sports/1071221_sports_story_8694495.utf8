	BCCI in a fix over taxes
		 		 
	New Delhi: The BCCI is in a fix over the new Australian policy that requires deduction of taxes from the prize money of the touring Indian players and is in discussing how to go about the issue. For the present, the BCCI has decided to deduct the tax to be paid in that country from the match fees for Anil Kumble and his teammates during their tour Down Under. ldquo;The issue was discussed in the recent working committee meeting and we decided to leave it to our tax consultant to find a way out, rdquo; joint secretary M.P. Pandove said on Thursday. 
		 		 
	 ldquo;Any team visiting Australia and earning money has to pay tax. It is not that the players would have to pay anything from their pocket. As of now, they would receive deducted match fees and there is a double taxation avoidance treaty (in existence) between India and Australia, rdquo; Pandove said. Under the provisions of the treaty, the players would not be taxed for the second time when they return home. 

		 		 
	Lawson unsure
		 		 
	Melbourne: Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson said on Thursday that he had always felt ldquo;safe rdquo; in Pakistan but was unsure of security situation during the parliamentary elections next month.
		 		 
	 ldquo;Not for one second have I felt unsafe in Pakistan so far. But the elections in January could change things, rdquo; Lawson said. ldquo;Nobody really knows what rsquo;s going to happen after that. rdquo; 
		 		 
	Aussies most keen on IPL

In a survey conducted by the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA), more than 80 per cent of the players admitted that they were keen to play in the IPL.

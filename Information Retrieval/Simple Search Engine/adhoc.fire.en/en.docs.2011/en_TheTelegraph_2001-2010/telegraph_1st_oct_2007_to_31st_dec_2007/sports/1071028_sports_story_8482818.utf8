 Pak to benefit from Dravid omission: Inzy
New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Saturday expressed surprise at Rahul Dravids omission from the India squad for the first two ODIs and said it would benefit Shoaib Maliks team. Pakistan will get an advantage as Dravid is out of the team. If a famous and experienced player like Dravid is in the team, juniors can learn a lot from him, he said. Former India wicketkeeper and chief selector Syed Kirmani blasted the selectors decision. It is unfair. If this is the benchmark to drop the player of Dravids calibre, then it should happen to Sachin (Tendulkar), (Sourav) Ganguly and rest of the guys also if they fail in three/four innings. The same rule should apply to all of them, he told a television channel.  (PTI)

 Splendid may do it again 
 SRIMAX				 										Mysore: The Poonawalla Mysore Derby, originally scheduled for October 28, gets underway on Thursday. There are 12 hopefuls for the prized event which promises the winner a hefty purse of Rs. 48 lakh.				 										Of the dozen runners vying for the Derby honours, only three horses have the realistic credentials to win the race. Horses who merit attention are Splendid Surprise, Sweeping Success and Star Team.				 										Splendid Surprise, from trainer M. P. Maheshs yard, had broken the jinx after his series of failures when he won the Mysore 2000 Guineas in style. The Steinbeck-Falling Feather son is likely to start as favourite and he would be the one to beat in the Derby. J. Christopher partners the horse.				 										The challenge to Splendid Surprise may come from Sweeping Success and Star Team. While Sweeping Success (Placerville-Lady Moura) is the convincing winner of the Deccan Derby, Star Team and his jockey, B. Prakash, are seeking revenge for their humiliating defeat in the Guineas. 				 										SELECTIONS				 										12.30pm: Gati Power 1. Smile Again 2.

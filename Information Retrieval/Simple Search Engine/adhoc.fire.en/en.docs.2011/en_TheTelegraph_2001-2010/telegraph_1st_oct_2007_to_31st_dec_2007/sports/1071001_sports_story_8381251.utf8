 India A pull off a thriller
Rajkot: India A pulled off a thrilling one run victory over South Africa A in the pulsating third and final one-day match at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground here. Middle order batsman S. Badrinaths (88 .. and 4/43) allround performance and captain Mohammed Kaifs 98 saw India A clinch the three-match series 1-0. The first two ties in Ahmedabad and Vadodara were washed out. Bengals Manoj Tiwari failed to contribute, however, scoring just 4 before he was dismissed. Chasing 291 in 50 overs, the visitors were all out for 289 in the last ball of the final over. The Proteas needed 12 runs in the final over bowled by mediumpacer Praveen Kumar. Johan Botha and Charle Langeveldt were at the crease. Kumar conceded just two runs of his first three balls, but Botha then hit two successive fours on fourth and fifth ball. The visitors needed one run to level the score, but Botha failed to cover his ground while running for a single and was brilliantly run out by Kaif.Earlier, Kaif won the toss and decided to bat. Praveen Kumar (1) and Cheteshwar Pujara (0) failed to negotiate the new ball. Parthiv (15) too could not contribute and the hosts were in trouble with the score reading 23 for three in 10 overs.

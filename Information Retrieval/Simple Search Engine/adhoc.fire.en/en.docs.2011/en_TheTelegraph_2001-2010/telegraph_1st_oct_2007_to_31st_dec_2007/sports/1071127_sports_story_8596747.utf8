 Pereira defends Douglas
A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira came to Douglas da Silvas defence, saying it would be unwise to single out one player for the 1-2 loss to JCT on Monday. Douglas struggled as a defensive midfielder, being beaten time and again by Edu Ardo da Silva and Sunil Chhetri. No comment, was what Douglas had to say when asked to describe his performance. According to Pereira, it was just a bad day in office. From my perspective, it wasnt a bad match, but we didnt take advantage of the opportunities which came our way. The Brazilian also defended his move to start Jose Ramirez Barreto, who had been struggling with a groin injury in the build-up to Mondays game. He was absolutely fit before the match, but unfortunately suffered a foot injury and had to be taken off, the coach said. JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh attributed his teams success to better coordination in midfield. Our midfield functioned well and helped Edu score twice at crucial junctures. His goals proved too much for Mohun Bagan, Sukhwinder said.

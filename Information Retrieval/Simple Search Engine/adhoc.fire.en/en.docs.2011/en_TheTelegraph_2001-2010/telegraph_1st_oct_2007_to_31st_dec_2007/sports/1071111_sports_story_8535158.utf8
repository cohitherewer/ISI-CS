 Ric reveals Wright, Chappell link
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Charlesworth New Delhi: The new technical director of Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), Ric Charlesworth, on Saturday revealed that he had spoken to John Wright and Greg Chappell before he took up the assignment. The Australian hockey legend, however, didnt divulge what the two former cricket coaches told him about their experience in India. I spoke to many people, including Chappell and Wright about their Indian experience, said the former Australian skipper, who also captained Western Australia in cricket. I know I have to work here as an outsider. The best way is not to be a part of any group. My job is to remain unbiased. Charlesworth also dismissed any notion that he would interfere with the coaching process of the national team. I will only advise if Carvalho (Joaquim) wants it. Otherwise, I will have no role to play in coaching, Charlesworth clarified. According to IHF sources, national coach Carvalho was not too happy with the appointment of a technical director. He was apprehensive that the Australian, who has been appointed under instruction from the international hockey federation (FIH), may interfere in the coaching process. Charlesworth is working very intelligently, said an IHF official. Before coming to Delhi he went to Bangalore and had a quiet meeting with Carvalho. They discussed the national teams progress. FIH, which is keen to see the revival of Indian hockey at the international level, has almost forced the IHF to appoint Charlesworth till the 2010 World Cup in India. He would reportedly receive an annual salary of $150,000, which will be paid jointly by FIH and IOC. Charlesworth has been vested with lot of powers. Other than looking after senior and junior teams in both the mens and womens sections, he would also work as a consultant for Sports Authority of India (SAI) and ministry of youth affairs and aports. The selection process, the Australian said, was the most critical factor. Those selected should meet all criteria. This is a hard task. Charlesworth said he was surprised to see that the fixtures for the next Premier Hockey League (PHL) were not released yet. The tournament is starting next month. The draw should have been ready by now, he said.

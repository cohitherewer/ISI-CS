 Davydenkos wife questioned 
Steve Wilson Nikolay Davydenko The investigation into possible match-fixing on the ATP tour has been widened with Nikolay Davydenkos wife and brother the latest to be questioned in connection with allegations of wrong doing. The Russian world No 4s wife was asked about Davydenkos ability to withstand pain in the light of his withdrawal through injury in a match that attracted an unusual betting pattern, as highlighted by the betting exchange Betfair. Davydenko could not complete a second round match against world No 74 Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina in the Poland Open in August. Betfair voided around 3.5 million of bets on the match after identifying suspicious patterns of betting. The ATP investigation has been stepped up after Davydenko refused to provide details of telephone records as requested under the governing bodys anti-corruption regulations. Davydenko, who has consistently denied any involvement in match-fixing, refused the request to offer up the detailed records within seven days on legal advice. The Russians lawyer, Professor Frank Immenga, maintains that the ATPs request contravenes data protection laws because it is not restricted to his clients personal phones but also those of his family and friends. He is a professional sportsman, said Immenga. He doesnt have his own mobile phone. He has a manager who does that for him. The ATP sent my client the telephone request when he was playing at the US Open. He had to provide within seven days records of all telephones owned and used by him. The legality of the investigation is disputed by Davydenkos advisors and has been referred to the games anti-corruption hearing officer in Switzerland. If the Russian is charged and found guilty he could face a lifetime ban from the sport. While the hearing officers decision is still pending, Immenga has requested that the whole process be halted. I have asked for this to stop until December 31 and then the hearing officer can decide whether they should continue or not, said Immenga. Nikolay is under economic and mental pressure. He has done everything he could; he and his wife and brother have talked to the investigation. Now they have been investigating for four months they have the names of the accounts of everyone who has bet on this. An ATP spokesman said: Honesty and integrity are critical in our sport. This is why we are engaged in a serious, comprehensive and thorough independent investigation to ascertain whether anything of concern took place.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

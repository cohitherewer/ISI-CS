 CRICKET BRIEFS 
World Cup song by Brett LeeMelbourne: Australian pacer Brett Lee is all set to produce and perform the theme song for the 2011 World Cup in the subcontinent. The tearaway bowler, who turned 31 on November 8, said he was looking forward to wooing billions of people in the region with his song for the mega event, to be hosted jointly by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Musics a great passion of mine, apart from cricket, and to be able to produce a song for such a big occasion  particularly given its in the subcontinent, a place that I love  only adds to the excitement, Lee told an Australian daily.The people in that part of the world have such a passion for cricket and music. Im sure the World Cup on the subcontinent is going to be a great event, he added. The song will also make the affable Aussie one of the highest-selling musicians from Down Under along with pop star Kylie Minogue. Inquest extended Kingston: DNA samples taken from the body of former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer will be re-tested, extending the inquest into his death into a fourth week. Woolmer, a former England batsman, was found unconscious in his Jamaica hotel room on March 18, a day after Pakistan crashed out of the World Cup after a shock defeat against minnows Ireland. Coroner Patrick Murphy has asked for more tests of samples from Woolmers corpse, pushing the review beyond Fridays scheduled conclusion. The latest testimony focused upon what money Woolmer had and when and where he had obtained it. Money he had on March 12 was not his World Cup per diem.Atherton lauds SA moveCalcutta: Michael Atherton has welcomed South Africa sport ministers recent statement that racial quota in cricket is on its way out, says A Staff Reporter. The former England captain, in his column for The Sunday Telegraph, wrote: No one would argue whether Gibbs and Ntini are worth their place in the side. More recently, Prince and Amla have shown themselves to be international players of calibre Older, white South African cricketers were openly cynical. No doubt this was partly because of his look  the long beard poking through his helmet. And this surely is the strongest reason why quotas should be abolished, to spare cricketers like Amla the embarrassment of being seen as a puppet who doesnt belong.De Mel refuses to commentColombo: Sri Lankas chief selector Asantha de Mel Sunday declined to comment after being called a joker by senior batsman Marvan Atapattu during the ongoing opening Test in Australia. I do not want to comment and I want to ignore his comments. All that I am keen as the chief selector to see Sri Lankan batsmen save the test, De Mel said. The 36-year-old opening batsman Saturday blamed the selectors for the teams current woes. Sri Lanka Cricket at this moment of time is not going in the direction it should be going, especially with a set of muppets headed by a joker, Atapattu said.

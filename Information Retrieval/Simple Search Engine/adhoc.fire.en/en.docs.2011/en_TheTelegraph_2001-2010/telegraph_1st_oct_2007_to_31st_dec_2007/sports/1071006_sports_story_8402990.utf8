 Inzy to quit after 2nd Test vs SA
 Inzamam-ul Haq in Karachi on Friday. (AP) Karachi: Former captain Inzamam-ul Haq announced on Friday that he will retire after the second Test against South Africa in Lahore, for which he has been guaranteed a place in the playing XI. The announcement pulls the curtains on an illustrious career spanning over 16 years in which he scored 25 Test centuries. The 37-year-old former captain said that he still had a couple of years left in him, but took the decision because he wanted to go gracefully. I thought about my future a lot Although I felt I can play for another one or two years, I think my presence in the dressing room may put pressure on the new captain and other players So I have decided to retire now gracefully, Inzamam said. I think this is the best time for me to move on and give the younger players a chance to cement their place. I have not taken this decision under any pressure from anyone, he added. Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson urged his team not to get distracted by Inzamams farewell during the second Test in Lahore. Inzamam deserves a grand farewell and I hope he gets not one but two hundreds in the match. But we as a team know what we must do to win the Test and level the series, the Australian said after Pakistans loss in the first Test. In a separate incident on Friday, Inzamam made it clear that he would not testify in Darrell Hairs racial discrimination suit against the ICC in London. (AGENCIES)

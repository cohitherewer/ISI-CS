 Ghei ends tied 55th, Jyoti 58th
Shanghai: Gaurav Ghei returned a roller coaster one-over 73 to finish tied 55th, while Jyoti Randhawa carded his weeks worst of seven-over 79 to slump further and sign off a disappointing tied 58th in the five million dollar HSBC Champions golf tournament here on Sunday. While Ghei accumulated a total of 11-over 299, Randhawa was a couple of shots adrift of his compatriot in Asias richest event. Ghei started with a bogey on the first before dropping another shot on the sixth. The seasoned pro recovered to strike a birdie on the seventh but stumbled to a ninth-hole bogey to make the turn two-over. The Delhi-golfer seemed on way to a recovery in his back nine  with birdies on the 13th and 16th  but a dropped shot on the final hole spoilt his chances of a better finish. Randhawa dropped a double bogey on the first. He then added to his woes with bogeys on the second and fourth hole. However, the 32-year-old arrested the slide by gaining strokes on the fifth, sixth and eighth hole before undoing the good work in a disastrous back nine. The Indian first stumbled to a double bogey on the 10th and then dropped three shots in the space of four holes from 15th to 18th to round off a disappointing day. World No. 2 Phil Mickelson survived a dramatic collapse to win in a three-way playoff. The 37-year-old blew a five-shot lead during his final round and had to fight it out with Britons Ross Fisher and Lee Westwood before sinking a four-foot birdie putt on the second extra hole to claim his first title in Asia.

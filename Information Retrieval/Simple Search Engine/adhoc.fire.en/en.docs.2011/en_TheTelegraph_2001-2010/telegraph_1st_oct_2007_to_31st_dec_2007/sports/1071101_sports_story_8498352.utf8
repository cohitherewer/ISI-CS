 12 umpires on panel
A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The International Cricket Councils board has decided to expand the Elite Panel of Umpires from 10 to 12 to cope with the busy international schedule, besides approving a merit-based increment for the officials. In a two-day meeting that concluded in Dubai on Wednesday, the board accepted the recommendations made by the umpires task force, concerning the structure, support mechanisms, remuneration and selection of officials in future. The Elite Panel of Umpires will be expanded from 10 to 12 to cope with busy periods in the cricket calendar, allow the leading officials to spend less time away from home and also allow them to work on their skills, the media release said. The board decided that the selection of umpires to the panels and matches should be carried out by an independent three-person selection group chaired by the ICC general manager, cricket. The board appointed a four-man recruitment committee to lead the search for a successor to current CEO Malcolm Speed, who is to step down at next years ICC annual conference in June-July. The committee comprises president Ray Mali, president-elect David Morgan, vice-president Sharad Pawar and chairman of the governance review committee Creagh Connor. The board also adopted amendments to the ICC memorandum and articles, which were formally drafted at the ICC annual conference. The amendments include: approval of a regional rotation policy for the ICC presidency, starting in 2008 with a candidate from England/West Indies (David Morgan), followed by India/Sri Lanka (Sharad Pawar); Australia/New Zealand; Bangladesh/Pakistan; South Africa/Zimbabwe; and an associate/affiliate representative, before this cycle of rotation begins again.

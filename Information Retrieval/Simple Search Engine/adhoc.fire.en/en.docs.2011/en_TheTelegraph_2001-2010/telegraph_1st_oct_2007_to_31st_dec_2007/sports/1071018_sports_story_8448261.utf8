 Anand: An unbelievable reception
OUR CORRESPONDENTChennai: M.G. Road in Besant Nagar on Wednesday evening was strewn with rose petals as the horse driven Victorian carriage carrying world chess champion Viswanathan Anand slowly made its way to his residence as the wizard touched back home to a heros welcome. The 90-year-old young national chess player, Bhau Padsalgikar, who had come all the way from Sangli in Maharashtra with small band chess lovers, was unabashedly jumping with joy. Anand was truly overwhelmed even as hundreds of students all along the five-km route from near the Ambika Appalam Depot opposite the Adyar Bus station, from where the procession began around 3.30pm, swarmed his chariot to shake hands and get his autograph. It is an unbelievable reception. I could not even dream of getting such a reception. I am at a loss for words. The whole journey was fantastic, said Anand in a brief response to the media before retiring for the day.

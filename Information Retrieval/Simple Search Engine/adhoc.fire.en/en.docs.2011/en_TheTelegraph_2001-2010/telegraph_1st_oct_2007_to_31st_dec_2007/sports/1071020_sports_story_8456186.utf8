 Nadal no match for Nalbandian
 Madrid: Unseeded Argentine David Nalbandian inflicted a shock 6-1, 6-2 defeat on world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the Madrid Masters on Friday to earn a semi-final date with Serbian youngster Novak Djokovic. An out-of-sorts Nadal still looked to be suffering from the after-effects of Thursday nights gruelling victory over Andy Murray as he surrendered his serve on five occasions and failed to find the range on his ground strokes. For Nalbandian, a runner-up in Madrid in 2004, the victory put him into the last four of a tournament for the first time this year and came as a welcome boost at the end of a disappointing season that saw him drop out of the top 10 to 25th in the world. Unlike Murray, who had five break points early in his match against Nadal, the Argentine took his chances and broke the Spaniards serve in the third. With Nadal on the ropes, he broke twice more to take the set 6-1 in under half an hour. Nadal struggled to control his ground shots while Nalbandian continued to exploit his problems to the full as he stretched the Mallorcan across the court and kept the rallies going to tire his opponent. A frustrated Nadal slammed an easy forehand into the net to surrender his serve once again in the second game and although he tried to pump himself up with the crowds support, he was unable to break the Argentines concentration. Earlier world No. 3 Djokovic powered his way to a 7-6, 6-2 win over unseeded Croat Mario Ancic to book his place in the last four. The 20-year-old Serb became the first player to take a set off Ancic this week when he took the opener on a tie-breaker, but then twice broke his opponents serve in the second to run out a comfortable winner.

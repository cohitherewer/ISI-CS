 Its official: Brazil to host 2014 Cup
 - Five-time champions to stage showpiece event after 64 years  Dunga and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva with the World Cup after Brazil was named hosts for the 2014 edition. (AFP) Zurich: Brazil, the only bidding country, were named as the host nation of the 2014 World Cup finals by world soccers governing body Fifa on Tuesday. They become the fifth country to host two World Cups following Mexico (1970 and 1986), France (1938 and 1998), West Germany/ Germany (1974 and 2006) and Italy (1934 and 1990). Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the president of Brazil who was present at Fifa House where the announcement was made said: I would just like to say how happy I am to see Brazils name on that card. Organising the World Cup is a huge task and we have far more responsibility weighing on our shoulders than when we arrived here. But we will organise a great World Cup and I am very happy. Fifa president Sepp Blatter said although there was only one candidate, Fifa still had a tough task in awarding the finals to Brazil. It was a real big challenge, he said: There were the same list of responsibilities and the same conditions that had to be met as if there had been more candidates. Brazil, who have won the World Cup a record five times and are the only country to have played in all 18 World Cup finals tournaments, last staged the event in 1950. They become the first South American hosts since Argentina staged and won the 1978 World Cup finals. Brazil were the only country nominated to bid for the World Cup by the South American confederation (CONMEBOL) whose turn it was to stage the finals after they were awarded to Europe (Germany) in 2006 and Africa (South Africa) in 2010. Eighteen cities have bid to stage matches, and, according to the Fifa inspection report published last week, it is envisaged that between eight to 10 cities will host games. However, the report, while giving the bid its blessing, says that none of the stadiums are currently up to Fifa safety standards for staging World Cup matches. That includes the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, which held a world crowd of 199,000 for the 1950 final. Brazil were the only contenders because of Fifas policy of rotating World Cups through its six continental confederations, a strategy that was scrapped on Monday. More than 160 Brazilian delegation members and media were in Zurich for Tuesdays announcement including President Lula, Romario and Dunga, who captained the side in 1994 and is now the national coach. Pele, however, who was in Brazils winning World Cup teams of 1958 and 1970, was not with the delegation. He has not endorsed Brazils World Cup hosting aspirations in the past. It is of huge importance for the country. There is plenty of time to organise and to build what needs to be done, former player Junior, who played for Brazil 74 times, said. Brazil is the only one of seven countries that have won the World Cup never to have lifted the trophy on home soil. Well see if we can do that in 2014, former Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said. We have seven years to build the stadiums. Germany, meanwhile, have been named as the hosts of the 2011 womens World Cup, beating off a rival bid from Canada. Germany have won the last two womens World Cup finals. We are very proud and grateful for this distinction of being able to organise the 2011 womens World Cup after hosting the 2006 World Cup, German football association president Theo Zwanziger said following the announcement. Australia have said they would probably bid to host the 2018 soccer World Cup after Fifa scrapped the rotation policy that would have taken the tournament to North America. Football Federation Australia chief executive Ben Buckley said Tuesday Australia were very serious about bidding for the tournament. We flagged our intention to bid for the World Cup at the earliest possible opportunity and we are delighted that the Fifa executive committee has decided to abandon the rotation policy, Buckley said.

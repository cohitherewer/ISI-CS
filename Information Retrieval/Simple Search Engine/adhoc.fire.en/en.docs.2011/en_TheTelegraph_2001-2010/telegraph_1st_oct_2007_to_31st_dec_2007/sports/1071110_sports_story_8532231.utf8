 Smooth Roger hopes to play another 9 years
 Roger Federer receives a caricature from a local fan at a promotional in Shanghai on Friday Shanghai: Roger Federer has some bad news for his rivals: Retirement is so far in the future that he hasnt really thought about what he might do when he hangs up his tennis shoes for good. I hope I play for a very long time, Federer said Friday, mentioning a target of competing until he turns 35. Considering hes only 26 and already is within sight of Pete Samprass record of 14 Grand Slam titles, that could be a very long time indeed for perennial No. 2 Rafael Nadal and up-and-coming stars like Novak Djokovic, not to mention talented adolescents whacking balls on practice courts around the world while dreaming of becoming No. 1 some day. Federer already has held that distinction for four consecutive years and shows no signs of slowing down, with three Grand Slam championships among his seven titles this year. A victory at the Australian Open in January would pull him within one of Samprass mark heading into the one major that has eluded the Swiss star so far, the French Open. For now, the target is a fourth title at the Masters Cup that opens in Shanghai on Sunday for the worlds top eight players. With Nadal and Roddick fighting knee problems and Nikolay Davydenko weighed down by a match-fixing scandal, the path seems less treacherous than usual. Federers hoped-for longevity would clearly be good news for a sport that already was trying to bolster its popularity even before the match-fixing broke recently  and even better news for the corporate sponsors eager to trade on his talent and squeaky-clean image. That was clear as Federer gave a shaving lesson Friday night to 1,000 male college students. Thats right: a shaving lesson. For some athletes, this promotion for Gillette  Federer did another gig for a coffee-maker the day before  could have been an exercise in farce. But demonstrating the same grace he shows on the court and the wit he often wields away from the game, Federer somehow pulled it off, even while spouting lines like: Its about waking up in the morning and feeling fresh and confident. Then the guys in the crowd followed suit, with mirrors lined up on tables so they wouldnt nick themselves. The most interesting moments came when Federer was asked questions submitted in advance by the audience. First up was what he planned to do when he retires. The query seemed to briefly put him on his back foot before he said he would play until hes 35 if his body holds up. While many of the pretenders to his throne have been hit with a variety of ailments, Federer has remained nearly injury free. He did say he hopes to do more work for his charitable Roger Federer Foundation, might start a family with his longtime girlfriend and hopes more opportunities will open up to him as he continues to play.

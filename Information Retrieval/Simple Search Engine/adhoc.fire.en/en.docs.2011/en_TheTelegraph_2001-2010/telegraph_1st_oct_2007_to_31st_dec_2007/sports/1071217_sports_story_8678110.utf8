 Bagan let go lead twice 

Margao: Mohun Bagan survived some anxious moments in the second half before holding Churchill Brothers to a 2-2 draw in the sixth round of the ongoing ONCG I-League at Nehru Stadium here on Sunday. 
After a barren first half, Mohun Bagan took the lead in the 47th minute through Dharamjit Singh, but Odafe Okolie netted Churchill Brothers equaliser in the 66th minute. 
Bhaichung Bhutia then put the Calcutta outfit in lead for the second time in the 70th minute, but the Goa team hit back one minute later, restoring parity through Man of the Match Mboye Iyomi. 
Mohun Bagan were reduced to 10 men in the early part of the second half after Maldives referee Ahmed Ameez showed N. Mohanraj the marching orders after he received his second yellow card for a tackle on Okolie. 
The draw took Churchill to 10 points from six matches while Mohun Bagan collected five points from as many outings. 
Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira finally started an XI without Douglas da Silva, who has been off-colour in the competition so far. Peter Odafe came in place of the Brazilian. 
Bhaichung amp; Co. had a clear chance to forge ahead in the 25th minute but the captain struck a weak header from close, which was collected by keeper Vinay Singh. 
After Mohanrajs exit, Mohun Bagan were forced to play a defensive game, but their defenders did a good job in keeping the Churchill strikers at bay until Okolie found the equaliser in the 67th minute off a cross pass from Reisangmi Vashu. 
The match came alive when Mohun Bagan took the lead again in the 71st minute via Bhaichung. But their joy was short lived as Iyomi scored the equaliser within a minute off a pass from Odafe. 
Meanwhile, Dempo stayed on top of the I-League when they drew goalless with JCT, Phagwara, in a sixth-round match at the Ambedkar Stadium on Sunday, adds Our Special Correspondent from New Delhi. 
Dempo lead the 10-team pack with 14 points and JCT are in second place with 12. 
The clash of the league toppers, which was shifted to Delhi after the Guru Nanak Stadium in Ludhiana became unavailable because of an ongoing kabaddi meet, was a dull affair and never rose to great heights. (Agencies)

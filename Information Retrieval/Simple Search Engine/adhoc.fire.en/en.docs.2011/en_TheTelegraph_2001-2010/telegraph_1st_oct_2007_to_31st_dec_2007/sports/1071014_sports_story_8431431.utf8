 I expected Marion to confess: Ben 
 Ben Johnson during his infamous 100m run at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. Picture below shows Marion Jones celebrating her 100m win at the Sydney Games London: Disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson wasnt surprised by Marion Jones confession, and hes now waiting for more athletes to admit they took performance-enhancing drugs. Johnson ran a record 9.79 seconds to win the 100m gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, then tested positive for the steroid stanozolol and was stripped of his medal and time. I expected it, Johnson said of Jones, who admitted last week that she was using banned substances when she won five Olympic medals at the 2000 Sydney Games. But again I believe that everyone on the international level is using performance-enhancing drugs and, you know, its widespread and its going to continue, the Canadian said in a radio interview. A lot more people (are) going to be also coming forward. Johnson said current athletes would have a harder time covering up their illegal activities. The tests will be more powerful, and these people who are trying to mask this information, theyre going to have problems, he said. Jones, who gave back her three gold and two bronze medals, pleaded guilty last Friday and announced her retirement from the sport. I support her, and, you know, its going to be tough times, Johnson said. Her life has changed now. Johnson, who last year claimed Carl Lewis played a part in a conspiracy to sabotage him at the 1988 Games, said there is even more pressure on athletes to be faster now than when he was running. Its much greater now than I was competing because theres too (much) prize money out there, said Johnson, who thinks he was unlucky to get caught when he did. Meanwhile, Jearl Miles-Clark, a former relay teammate of Jones, acknowledged she might have to pay for the disgraced sprinters doping violations, perhaps even giving back her gold medal. I defended Marion against critics and said that I wouldnt believe she had taken performance-enhancing drugs unless she said it herself, Miles-Clark said in a statement Friday. Well, the other day she admitted it, and the reality of the situation has to be dealt with. (AP)

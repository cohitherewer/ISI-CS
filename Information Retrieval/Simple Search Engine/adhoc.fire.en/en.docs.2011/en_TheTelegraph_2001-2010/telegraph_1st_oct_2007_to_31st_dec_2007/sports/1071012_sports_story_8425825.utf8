 Landis goes to CAS
Washington: Disgraced American rider Floyd Landis said on Wednesday he had lodged an appeal against his two-year doping ban with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Landis had 30 days to appeal last months divided ruling by an arbitration panel which upheld findings that he used synthetic testosterone in winning the 2006 Tour de France. After much thought, I have decided to appeal my case to the CAS, Landis said in a statement. I want to take this opportunity to say again, that I am innocent of the doping allegations against me.

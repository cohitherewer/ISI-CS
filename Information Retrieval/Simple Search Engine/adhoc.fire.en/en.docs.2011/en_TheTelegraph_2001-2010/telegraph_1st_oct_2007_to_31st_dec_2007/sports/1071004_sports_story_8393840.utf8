 Jothi earns a point for Md. Sporting
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Mohammedan Sporting came from behind to draw 1-1 with George Telegraph in their ninth encounter of the Sahara CFL Premier Division at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. Jothi Kumar ensured a point for Mohammedan Sporting with a goal in the 79th minute to neutralise Nuruddin Salau Olawales 41st-minute strike. Playing in front of near-empty stands, both teams appeared listless from the early minutes. The injured Paul Noachuku  Mohammedan Sportings lone man up front  was mostly ineffective and had to be replaced by Roque Barreto in the 68th minute. The midfielders and defenders were no better, encouraging George Telegraph to get ambitious. Pauls only good moment came early in the game, but his long-range shot was well thwarted by George keeper Arnab Das Sharma in the sixth minute. George Telegraph muffed a sitter in the 21st minute when Goutam Thakurs right-footer missed the target by a whisker. Twenty minutes later, Nuruddin converted a Thakur cross from the left. Roques introduction sparked some urgency in the Mohammedan Sporting ranks. In the 79th minute, his centre from the right found Jothi in the right spot to shoot home the equaliser. Mohammedan Sporting took their tally to nine points from nine matches. George Telegraph went up to five from 10 matches.

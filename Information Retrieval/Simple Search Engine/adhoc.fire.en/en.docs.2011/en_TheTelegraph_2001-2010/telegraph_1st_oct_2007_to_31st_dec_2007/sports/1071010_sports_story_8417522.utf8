 Vengsarkar, Rajput cautioned by BCCI
Rajkot: The BCCI has taken exception to selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar and team manager Lalchand Rajputs statements to the media over the senior players performance. If the selectors are unhappy with their performance, they can be dropped. But they should not go to the media and discuss the matter, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said here on Tuesday. The BCCI has asked Vengsarkar and Rajput not to speak to the media about such issues in the future, Shah said. I have personally discussed it with Vengsarkar and Rajput and cautioned them not to speak openly against any player, Shah said. Vengsarkar is the selection committee chairman and should talk to the concerned players and discuss the matter with them. It is not proper to criticise players openly, he said. Vengsarkar had recently said that senior players will have to perform if they want to stay in the team, while Rajput responded by saying that he should not have made such comments in the middle of a series.

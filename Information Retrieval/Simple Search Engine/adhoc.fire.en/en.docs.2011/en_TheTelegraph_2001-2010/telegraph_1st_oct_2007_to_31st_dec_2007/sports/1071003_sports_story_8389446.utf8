 Barreto: Enjoying the competition 
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Twenty-four hours after Edmilson Marques struck four goals to go atop the scorers list, fellow-Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto netted a brace to reclaim his position as the ongoing CFL Premier Divisions No. 1 striker. The question was bound to be thrown at Barreto: You must have been eager to overtake Edmilson on Tuesday? Hes in great form, Im also in very good form, both of us are scoring many goals Theres no rivalry between us, Im enjoying the competition, said Barreto, who took his tally to 11 (one more than Edmilson). Delighted with the 3-0 win over Chirag United SC, Barreto said he wasnt thinking of the East Bengal match yet. We are going match by match and not thinking too far ahead, said the Brazilian. Coach Roberto Carlos Pereira was a satisfied man too. United SC are a very strong side, the 3-0 result tells you that we won comfortably. Someone asked him why the side wasnt very impressive, the usually calm Brazilian lost his cool for a moment. Mohun Bagan are not Barcelona Mohun Bagan can play like Mohun Bagan only. Picking Barreto as the player of the match, Pereira said he was also impressed by second-half substitute Sewram Gobin. I want to try out as many players as possible.

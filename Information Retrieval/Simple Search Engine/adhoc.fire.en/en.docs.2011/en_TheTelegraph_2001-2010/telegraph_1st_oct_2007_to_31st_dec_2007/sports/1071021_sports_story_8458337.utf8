 Pole for Massa, Hamilton second
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIESSao Paulo: McLarens Lewis Hamilton drew first blood in his Formula One title battle by qualifying in front of his two rivals for Sundays Brazilian Grand Prix. Hamilton, the 22-year-old rookie who can become Formula Ones youngest champion on Sunday, will start second with Ferraris Brazilian Felipe Massa on pole position for the second successive year in front of his home fans. Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen was third fastest in Saturdays qualifying and shares the second row in the season-ending race with McLarens unhappy double world champion Fernando Alonso. Hamilton leads Spaniard Alonso by four points, with Finlands Raikkonen a further three behind in the first three-way title decider since 1986. Hamilton, who saw the Interlagos track for the first time only on Thursday, said he had enjoyed the session. We seem to have really good pace here, he said. Im just buzzing, really buzzing. Hamilton will be champion if the grid positions are maintained and having Massa, who won in Brazil last year, on pole rather than Raikkonen or Alonso also boosted his chances. No driver has won a race this season from further back than third place on the grid. Its a fantastic feeling, said Massa of his sixth pole of the year that also leaves him with a real chance of winning again on Sunday. Massa would have been expected to help Raikkonens championship challenge but, with Hamilton sandwiched between the Ferraris, that may not be possible. Id rather be on the front row but thats where we are, said the Finn. Tomorrow we can try and do something different and see what happens. On Friday, McLaren came dangerously close to exceeding the dictionary definition of the word competence for the second successive Grand Prix weekend. How else does one explain the kind of tyre catastrophe that put Hamilton through the ringer a fortnight after the rubber fiasco in China that speared his coronation? Ferrari must have laughed their socks off when McLaren sent the championship leader out on two sets of wet weather tyres during Fridays first practice session when only one is permitted. Hamiltons teammate Alonso could not have been anything other than delighted. Asked about Raikkonens chances, Ferrari team manager Jean Todt delivered the understatement of the year: In this business too many things can happen. Not much. The last thing Hamilton needed on the eve of this momentous weekend was another visit to the stewards office. One hundred per cent our fault. We are trying so hard. It was a silly mistake, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis said. Human does not get the job done in circumstances such as these. Professionalism is the minimum requirement. On the day of Hamiltons appointment, Dennis made it a condition that Hamilton knew the Formula One rulebook inside out by the time of the first race in Australia. Pity he did not extend the instruction to the pit crew. As day turned to night Hamilton still waited to learn the severity of the penalty. When the verdict was handed down, McLaren escaped with a 7,300 fine. But what price shredded nerves? It could have been much worse, a grid penalty was thought to be the most likely outcome, which would hardly have sent him into qualifying with a smile on his face.

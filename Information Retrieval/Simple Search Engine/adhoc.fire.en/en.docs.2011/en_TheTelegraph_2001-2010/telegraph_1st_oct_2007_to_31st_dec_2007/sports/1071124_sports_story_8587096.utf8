 Sachin in the form of his life: Akram
A STAFF REPORTER Wasim Akram in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: The Big Three of Indian cricket found a supporter in Pakistan legend Wasim Akram on Friday. Akram, who was in the city to create awareness on diabetes through his Accu-Chek campaign, said that Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid had a lot to offer Indian cricket. Those who were saying the trio should be dropped are totally wrong. These guys are very fit at 34 (Sourav is 35). And they still have a lot to offer Indian cricket, the 41-year-old said authoritatively. The man who had some memorable contests with Sachin had a special word of praise for the seniormost pro. He (Sachin) is in the form of his career. Ive never seen him bat like this Its entirely up to him to decide when he wants to retire, the former Pakistan captain said. Akram, who played 60 matches (48 Tests and 12 ODIs) against India, said the two countries always featured in keenly contested battles. On the ongoing three-Test series, Akram said: India are the favourites going by the way they are performing But everyday the complexion of the game changes. Its too early to predict the winners. In an Indo-Pak contest, the players fight till the last minute. Akram praised Indias left-arm medium-pacers Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan and R.P. Singh, picking the last named for special praise. RP is really impressive He is sharp and swings the ball at a speed of 130-140 kmph, said Akram, who has a record 502 ODI wickets from 356 appearances. On Shoaib Akhtar, Akram said: Pakistan needed him to be in the side. Now we need him to perform to win the series. Asked what the turning point of his career was, Akram said: It was after I joined Lancashire that I became a much improved bowler. Akram, who claimed a record four hattricks in international cricket (two each in Tests and ODIs), retired shortly after the 2003 World Cup.

 Visitors to fly in 2nd keeper
Karachi: Pakistan will be sending a second wicketkeeper to India as reinforcement for the injured Kamran Akmal, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Sunday. The tour selection committee has requested for a second wicketkeeper since Akmals finger injury has worsened. The national selectors will now decide on the replacement, a PCB spokesman said. Pakistan lost the third one-day International on Sunday in Kanpur and trail 1-2 in the five-match series. Sarfraz Ahmed, who led Pakistan to the ICC Youth World Cup title last year, is expected to replace Akmal who is suffering from indifferent form in the one-day series. Akmal is being severely criticised for his ordinary show though he found a supporter in captain Shoaib Malik, who defended him during the post-match press conference in Kanpur. A PCB source said that the board and selectors were already concerned with Akmals form and were trying to discuss the issue with the team management in India. Sarfraz is considered to be one of the most promising keepers in Pakistan and has done well at the domestic level. Apart from Sarfraz, Test batsman Faisal Iqbal may also fly to India as back-up for senior pro Mohammed Yousuf who has complained of a knee problem, sources added. Yousuf had undergone a MRI before going to India but the results had cleared him of a major problem. (AGENCIES)

 Mistakes in post-mortem: Pathologist
 Bob Woolmer Kingston: Mistakes were made in post-mortem examinations of late Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, a British pathologist said under cross-examination at an inquest into Woolmers death. Pathologist Nathaniel Carey spent the three-hour morning session on Thursday answering questions from Kent Pantry, Jamaicas director of public prosecution, in the probe into the shock death of the 58-year-old former England player. Woolmer was found in his room at the Jamaica Pegasus unconscious on March 18, a day after Pakistan were embarrassed by Ireland in the World Cup. Carey told the court that Jamaican government pathologist Ere Sheshiah, who conducted the first post-mortem, made a mistake when he suggested murder. Following Sheshiahs post-mortem two days after Woolmer died, the Jamaican police first reported inclusive and then suspicious circumstances around the death before saying Woolmer was murdered. Jamaican police went to Scotland yard for help and Londons Metropolitan Police, after an exam by Carey concluded that Woolmer was not murdered, but died of heart failure. Carey, who said there was no evidence of strangulation or poison, admitted he also made mistakes in a pathology exam of Woolmer. In his report, Carey said the neck was cut before the brain was removed, but after shown videos, he admitted otherwise. I was mistaken when I said the brain was not removed before the next. I have to withdraw that statement, Carey told the court. (AFP)

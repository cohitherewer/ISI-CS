 It was one of those days: Bhaichung
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: The Indian football team returns home early on Wednesday, their hopes of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup practically dashed. The Indians lost 1-4 to Lebanon in Beirut on Monday (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). Captain Bhaichung Bhutia, however, reached late on Tuesday as he has a function to attend in Calcutta on Wednesday. It was one of those days when nothing went right, he said. We missed chances in the first half. They played very well in the second. We will do our best to make a comeback in the home match in Chennai. The unexpected defeat has pushed India to the brink of elimination as they now have a tough task in the home leg on October 28. Bob Houghtons men will now have to win by at least a 3-0 margin in Chennai to take advantage of the one away goal that they scored through Sunil Chhetri on Monday. Going by the result of the first match, such a turnaround looks unlikely as Lebanon have proved to be much tougher opponents than they were expected to be. Placed just one spot above India (145) in the Fifa rankings, the West Asian side simply routed the visitors, especially in the second session when they scored three goals in a span of 15 minutes. Two Lebanon players  Mohammed Ghaddar and Roda Antar who plays for FC Colonge in Bundesliga  were in great form and rattled the Indian defence, in which only Mahesh Gawali performed creditably. The midfield, too, failed to perform. The result has shocked the All India Football Federation (AIFF) officials, who were hoping for better days after the Nehru Cup win. Its a huge setback when things were beginning to look up, said an official. It could have an adverse effect on the inaugural Pro League also. A reputed club coach, who didnt wish to be named, said things will never improve unless the AIFF makes an effort to lift the standard of age- group soccer. Houghton is a great coach but he must have enough options and reserves in hand to executive his plans.

 Windies seal historic win

Port Elizabeth: Fast bowlers Fidel Edwards and Jerome Taylor shared six wickets as the West Indies surged to their maiden Test win in South Africa Saturday. 
Chasing 389 to win the first Test, South Africa were dismissed for 260 after tea on the fourth day to hand the West Indies victory by 128 runs. Edwards took three for 37 with Taylor claiming three for 66. 
It was the West Indiess first away Test win against opposition other than Zimbabwe or Bangladesh since they beat England by an innings and 93 runs in June, 2000. 
The West Indies resumed their second innings on 146 for eight but were soon bowled out for 175, left-arm spinner Paul Harris taking both wickets to finish with four for 35. 
South Africa then slumped to 20 for three with fast bowler Daren Powell starting the slide. Edwards first struck when he had Hashim Amla caught behind by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin for eight.

 IAAF erases Marions results
Monte Carlo: All of Marion Joness results dating to September 2000, including her Olympic and world championship titles, were annulled Friday because of doping. Track and fields world governing body also told her to return prize money from that period. The IAAF recommended that Joness relay teammates be disqualified and lose their medals from the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The IAAF council also upheld the two-year ban imposed on Jones by US officials. She retired last month after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators in 2003. Jones admitted she had taken the designer steroid the clear from September 2000 to July 2001. Jones won gold medals in the 100m, 200m and the 1,600m relay in Sydney, as well as bronzes in the 400m relay and long jump. IAAF spokesman Nick Davies said Jones owes an estimated $700,000 in prize money and cant compete again unless she pays it back. Even though Jones has retired, she is officially suspended until October 7, 2009. Jones would have to give the IAAF 12 months notice if she wants to return to competition after the ban, Davies said. The IAAF did not take a position on whether Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou should be upgraded to the Olympic gold medal in the 100m. Thanou and fellow-Greek runner Kostas Kenteris failed to show up for drug tests on the eve of the 2004 Athens Games, claimed they were injured in a motorcycle accident and eventually pulled out. They were later banned for two years.  The IOC is considering whether to leave the 100m winners place vacant. (AP)

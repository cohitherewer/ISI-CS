 Lee: India series like Ashes
 Brett Lee Melbourne: Australian paceman Brett Lee has put the forthcoming four-Test home series against India on a par with an Ashes contest. The series starts on December 26 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Lee has fond memories of facing the Indians at the famous venue where he took five for 47 on debut against Sachin Tendulkars side eight years ago. Time has flown by so quickly and there are some absolutely great memories playing at the MCG, on a team basis and an individual basis, Lee was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper. We have always said that playing against England in the Ashes is where its at, but I also think now playing against India is one of our greatest challenges as far as Test match cricket goes. Lee hopes for more assistance from his fellow bowlers this summer as the home attack badly missed the injured Glenn McGrath and suspended Shane Warne when the Border-Gavaskar Trophy was last contested in Australia in 2003-04, with the series finishing 1-1. But the fast bowler has come a long way since and proved himself a worthy leader of the attack in the recent series win over Sri Lanka, when he took 16 wickets and was named the Player of the Series. Im really happy with the way that Im playing and Im happy with the way the teams going, he said. Speedster Shaun Tait is preparing himself for the possibility that Australian selectors will opt for a four- pronged pace attack for the first Test. (PTI)

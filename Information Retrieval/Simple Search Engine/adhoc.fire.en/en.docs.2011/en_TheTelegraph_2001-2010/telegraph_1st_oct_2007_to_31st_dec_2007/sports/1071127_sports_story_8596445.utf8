 Brazil stadium tragedy 
Brasilia: A deadly soccer stadium accident in Brazil has revealed grossly inadequate infrastructure in the country that will host the World Cup in 2014, experts said on Monday. Fans jumping to celebrate their teams victory in the northeastern city of Salvador fell to their deaths on Sunday as part of the stadium bleachers collapsed. At least seven people died and 40 were injured. Critics said on Monday that authorities had ignored warning about the poor condition of the Fonte Nova stadium in Salvador, one of 18 cities bidding to hold matches in the 2014 World Cup. Brazil was chosen as host only last month. This accident is not the best publicity for Brazil to host the Cup, Jose Roberto Bernasconi, head of the national association of engineering and architecture companies, said.
	The association had found several structural problems with the Salvador stadium in a report published this month.
	 What we found was worse than what we expected, Bernasconi said. Many stadiums are in an absolutely deplorable state. 
	The report showed that 80 percent of Brazils stadiums needed structural repairs, 90 percent had no access for handicapped people and 95 percent had poor or terrible sanitary facilities.
	 Only a few stadiums, including the famous Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, were considered adequate, the report said.  (Reuters)

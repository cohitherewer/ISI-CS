 Lloyd reflects on WI decline
THE TIMES, LONDON Clive Lloyd After Packer and World Series Cricket, Clive Lloyd returned to captain the West Indies in 1979. From that time until his retirement, the team were beaten in only three of the 47 Test matches in which they played, a loss rate of 6.4 per cent. In the next six years, when Vivian Richards was captain, that figure rose to 18.9 per cent, and under successive captains it has risen and risen till the wins and losses are almost a mirror image of what they were in Clives years. The greatest reason for the decline of the West Indian cricket is that we became thoughtless, says Clive in his forthcoming biography, Supercat. Too many people assumed that we had a right to go on being great for ever. It was as if they believed that the West Indians would always produce great cricket in the way that France is famed for its fine wine  a never-ending national institution. But life has changed for people in the West Indies, cricket has changed in the rest of the world, and we failed to appreciate those changes. To put it simply, the West Indies have lost for so long because there are not enough great players. Thats obvious. But great players dont just turn up, they have to be shaped. What very few people seem to realise is that the Test team I had in 1975-76 was really no different from the one that there is today in terms of its potential. Fidel Edwards and Daren Powell can both bowl at 90 miles per hour. (Shivnarine) Chanderpaul and (Ramnaresh) Sarwan are both world-class batsmen. Our cricketers are free-flowing men. Early on, Viv Richards was a free-flowing guy, he got forties and never made big scores. But you knew once he had harnessed his talent and got the mental side of his game right, then he was going to be a class player. Gordon Greenidge took some time to get going, same with Michael Holding. All those guys came in and worked at their game. The great West Indies sides were shaped, just as this one could be. The problems we are having now are the consequence of a decade of letting the fruit wither on the vine. There have been big cultural changes in the West Indies. The regional cricket competition is not what it was. Our cricketers no longer play county cricket. The board has not used its authority wisely. The players expectations, what they want from the game, what they want from life, have changed. Above all, we neglected to plan for the future. When people speak about the demise of the West Indian cricket, the influence of America is never very far from their lips. I disagree. I think the real sporting distraction has not come from basketball or the other American sports, but from football. Its true that in some of the islands, the first thing that a politician does is put up a basketball court; its much smaller and cheaper than a cricket ground, but I dont believe that a lot of kids go on to play professionally. In the summer of 2007, Gary Sobers was in England and told an audience about the problems facing cricket in the Caribbean: If someone said to me that soccer is the reason for West Indian cricket falling so low, I might think about it. But the real problem, and it is a problem for sport around the world, is television. Sir Gary mentioned his own boys, both fine sports players, whom he believed had suffered because of the distractions of modern life. When they got home from school they would not go outside and play, they would sit in front of a video. Thats your real culprit. Kids do not organise games of cricket by themselves, playing outside morning, noon and night. Today, if it is not organised, nobody leaves home. They wait for you to pick them up, take them to the ground, give them the best cricket attire. The natural flow of the game has gone. Its true that kids have many more things to do with their time, says Clive.

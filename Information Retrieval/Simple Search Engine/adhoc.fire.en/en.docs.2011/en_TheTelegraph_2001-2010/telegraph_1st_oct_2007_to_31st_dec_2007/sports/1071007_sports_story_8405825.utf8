 Greg: No need for a foreign coach
New Delhi: Former Team India coach Greg Chappell on Saturday said the team did not need a foreign coach. He felt anybody with skills to streamline players development could be useful for the job. Chappell said the process which he started during his tenure should be carried forward. Its not necessary to have a foreign coach. I think you need someone to manage the process of player development. Its an ongoing thing. Just because you reach the international level that does not mean your development stops. I mean in many cases, its the start of the development process. The work which was put into the players over three years was a very important part of the way they are right now and if you stop that work, the development process was going to drop off, Chappell told a TV chanel. The person is irrelevant as long as the right person is there and he can continue that management process of development of individuals and the team. I think anyone who thinks that you dont need someone to manage that process does not really understand much about it, he said. The former Australian captain, however, said he would not coach the Indian team if the offer came his way once again. No, I had a wonderful opportunity and wonderful experience and honour to coach India at international level. Its a very demanding role with any team. The amount of international cricket is being played, the amount of travel that goes on, its probably a young mans game, he said. (PTI)

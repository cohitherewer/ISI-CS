 Warne: Expect special knocks from Sachin

 Warne says Sachin is the greatest batsman he has played against 
Melbourne: Sachin Tendulkar may be in the twilight of his career but spin legend Shane Warne believes the master batsman is still a force to reckon with and would score heavily in his last tour of Australia. 
Warne, who mastered the art of leg-spin but failed to solve an enigma called Tendulkar during his illustrious career, warned the hosts to write off the great player at their own peril. 
I dont believe just because he is getting old, he is finished. Given the conditions, Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide are going to be pretty flat. I expect Sachin to get lots of runs, Warne said. 
There is no doubt that he will play one or two special innings in this Test series. Absolutely no doubt (that) he will play a couple of unbelievable, breathtaking innings. 
Warne chose Tendulkar as the greatest contemporary batsman he played against. 
He is the best batsman I have played either with or against. You never write off a great player, said Warne. 
Two of the Tests are in Sydney and Adelaide. Melbourne has been very, very benign and flat. If you dont take wickets with the new ball, you are in for a long day in the field. 
Warne said the experienced Indian batting line-up will pile up huge runs, but for getting 20 wickets and winning against the Australians, India will have to depend on spinners. 
Can India take 20 wickets? I think it will be down to Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. 
Two of the Tests are in Sydney and Adelaide. They are obviously spinning tracks. They will go in with two spinners and the wickets will help their batting. 
Warne expressed his admiration for captain Anil Kumble for being a gentleman and yet being the most competitive of players. 
He is one of the gentlemen of the game One of the nicest blokes you will ever meet but also one of the most competitive players going around in that Indian side. 
Warne also called former coach John Buchanan a goose and somebody who had no idea and lacked common sense. 
I dont think he has made one good point in a long time. He is living in a pixy land. We had to listen to his verbal diarrhoea all the time. Warne also chose to criticise the present set-up in Australia. 
Australian people, administrators, ex-players and coaches, also Buchanan, have got to stop the arrogant mindset that Australia are so much better than anybody else. 
There is going to be a time in the next two or three years when Australia are tested. 
Warne also gave an insight into what he intended to do with his life after cricket. 
I am looking to set up my own cricket academy where a lot of countries can send their captains and spinners and I can work with them. Its going to be more like a workshop than academy.

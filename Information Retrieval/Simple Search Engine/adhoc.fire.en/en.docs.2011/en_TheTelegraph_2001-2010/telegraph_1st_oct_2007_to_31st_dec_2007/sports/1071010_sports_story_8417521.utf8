 Late SA blows rock Pakistan
Lahore: Pakistan struggled to 140 for four in reply to South Africas 357 all out at close on day two of the second Test at the Gaddafi on Tuesday. Inzamam-ul Haq, 37, appearing in his 120th and final Test, was batting on 10 alongside Misbah-ul Haq (10) after Pakistan lost four wickets in the final session despite a confident opening stand of 90 by Salman Butt (40) and Kamran Akmal (52). Left-arm spinner Paul Harris took two wickets and pacemen Andre Nel and Dale Steyn took one each to rock Pakistan, who lost four wickets in the space of 33 runs. Inzamam got a warm ovation from a crowd of around 5,000 and a guard of honour from the South African team as he walked into bat at the same venue where he made his debut 17 years ago. I think the boys had talked about this (guard of honour) in the dressing room, but when Inzy came out it was more like a spontaneous reaction from them, coach Mickey Arthur said. I am proud of the boys the way they welcomed Inzamam, he added. Butt and Akmal brought up the 50 in 7.5 overs, but the visiting bowlers gained control after Harris had Butt caught round the corner by Graeme Smith as the batsman top edged a sweep shot. Nel then bowled Younis Khan (3), and Smith scooped up a low diving catch in the covers to get rid of Akmal, who hit seven fours in his sixth Test half-century. The biggest blow came with the total on 123 when Steyn trapped Mohammed Yousuf (25) leg before although TV replays suggested the ball was high. We attacked a bit more with the new ball, but after that I think we have done the right things, Arthur said. South Africa were earlier boosted by an eighth-wicket stand of 88 from 212 balls between Mark Boucher (54) and Harris (46) to frustrate the Pakistanis after resuming on their overnight 259 for six. The pair defied Pakistan bowlers for two hours and forty minutes on either side of the first two sessions. Paceman Umar Gul (3/103) got a much-needed breakthrough when Harris played a loose drive after lunch and spooned a catch to captain Shoaib Malik in the covers. Harris hit six boundaries in his 132-ball knock. Danish Kaneria (4/114) then clean bowled Steyn without scoring before Boucher completed his 26th test half century with a pulled six off of Gul.

 Maiden Durand for Churchill
New Delhi: Odafe Onyeka Okolie of Churchill Brothers scored in the final as the Goan club edged out Mahindra United 1-0 to lift their maiden Durand Cup title at the Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday. Mahindra United had scored only one goal in their three previous matches and their poor form continued in the final as their forwards failed to pose any real threat to the Churchill defence. Churchill skipper Odafe, on the other hand, had 10 goals in the tournament coming into the final and he lived up to his billing on the big day and was the clear difference between the two sides. Odafe was later declared the winner of the Golden Boot award. Churchill forwards Iyomi and Okolie made repeated forays into the rival defence and one of those attacks saw Odafe latch on to a pass from Bernardo Pires before taking aim at the goal from just inside the box that beat Mahindra custodian Sandeep Nandy all ends up. The match started in an explosive manner when Churchills Thokchom Naoba Singh, running in from the right flank, gave a fine centre that found Mboyo Iyomi, who tapped it inside the goal only to be ruled offside by the linesman. Odafe, who was firing on all cylinders in the first half, tucked himself into defence in the second session and that took the sting out of the Churchill attack. Meanwhile, New Road Tango (NRT) emerged champions in the 29 th All India Goverors Gold Cup in Gangtok on Wednesday. NRT beat arch-rivals Three Star Club.  (AGENCIES)

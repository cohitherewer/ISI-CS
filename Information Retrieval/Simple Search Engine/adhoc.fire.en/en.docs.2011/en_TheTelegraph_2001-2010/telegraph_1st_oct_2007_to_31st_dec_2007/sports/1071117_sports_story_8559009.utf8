The IPL is the Indian boards multi-million dollar professional Twenty20 league launched to counter the rebel version. Yousuf has been asked to attend the hearing in Mumbai a day before Pakistan begin their first Test against India in New Delhi on November 22. Indias Essel Group, the promoters of the ICL, confirmed they had sent the batsman a legal notice for arbitration. We will not let him set a bad example, Ashish Kaul, executive vice president of the Essel Group, said on Friday. The inaugural tournament of the ICL will be played from November 30 to December 16.

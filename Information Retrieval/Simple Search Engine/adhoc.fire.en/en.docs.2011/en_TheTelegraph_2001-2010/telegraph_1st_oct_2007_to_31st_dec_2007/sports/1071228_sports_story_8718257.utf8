 Sad day, say former captains

A STAFF REPORTER 
Calcutta: Former Bengal captains were unanimous in pointing out that Laxmi Ratan Shukla amp; Co. failed to recover from the shock after seven players joined the rebel Indian Cricket League . 
The following are excerpts from The Telegraphs conversation with three former captains (alphabetically): 
DEVANG GANDHI: Flawed strategy and lack of application from coach Bharat Arun led to Bengals relegation. I would ask the coach why did he play on greentops without having enough preparation? I am absolutely saddened to see Bengal go down like this. 
ARUN LAL: Its a sad and emotional experience for me. Theres no denying that Im deeply hurt by the plight of the team. I have not been following Bengal cricket now and, therefore, dont know what has gone wrong. May be some key players exodus to the ICL affected the team and the present players didnt fill up the vacuum. 
ASHOK MALHOTRA: Its just shocking, particularly after Bengal had played so well in the last two seasons. I would put the blame on Bharat Arun, who had no idea about his teams strengths and weaknesses. He thought a greentop would help Ranadeb Bose and Shib Shankar Paul, but didnt realise that his batsmen were not strong enough to back the move. .

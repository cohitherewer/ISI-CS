 Doctor testifies in Bob case
Kingston: Efforts to revive Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer when he was found unconscious were hindered by the position of his body, a doctor testified on Friday. Asher Cooper was the first doctor to reach Woolmers room at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel, where the former England player was found unconscious on March 18, a day after Pakistan were embarrassed by Ireland in a major World Cup upset. Cooper said the awkward position of the body initially prevented him from carrying out his usual resuscitation measures. When I went to the room, Woolmers head was under the toilet bowl and I could not do resuscitating exercises, Cooper told coroner Patrick Murphy on day four of the inquest that is being held at Jamaica Conference Centre in downtown Kingston. I was only able to take pictures with my cellular phone camera, which I gave to the police, he said. Cooper added with the help of the police, Woolmer was removed into the hall, where Cooper performed CPR and chest compression. He continued the measures until an ambulance arrived, even though Woolmer was without a pulse and not breathing. (AFP)

 Domenicali new Ferrari chief
Milan: Ferrari will replace Jean Todt as their Formula One team boss with Stefano Domenicali from January, the world champions said in a statement on Monday. Domenicali will head the Gestione Sportiva, Ferraris racing department, having served as sporting director. Todt, who has been team principal on an interim basis, looks set to revert to his role as chief executive of the overall company, including the commercial car business. The move follows news that former Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn is joining Honda as team principal. Brawn, the master strategist who helped Michael Schumacher win seven world championships with Benetton and Ferrari, had been on sabbatical from the Italian team since Schumacher retired at the end of 2006. The 61-year-old Todt said in August that he had no intention of retiring amid speculation that Brawn could return as Ferrari team boss with Todt stepping down. Ferrari have shuffled the rest of their backroom team with Mario Almondo becoming operations director, Aldo Costa taking on the role of technical director and Frances Gilles Simon staying as engine director. The statement also said further details about the organisation would be announced before the end of the year. Domenicalis elevation means Ferraris race team have gone back to the Italian roots of founder Enzo Ferrari after being run by Briton Brawn and Frenchman Todt. Ferrari won this seasons team championship after rivals McLaren were stripped of all their constructors points for a spy scandal. Ferraris former employee Nigel Stepney, a compatriot and close associate of Brawn, faces legal action for allegedly leaking classified technical information to McLaren. Honda, meanwhile, pulled off a major on Monday with the announcement that former Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn was joining them as team principal. Brawn said he decided to join Honda as team boss rather than return to Ferrari because he wanted more of a challenge than the Formula One champions could offer. The fact that Ferrari wasnt in crisis made it less attractive to me, the Briton said in a conference call on Monday after the Japanese team announced that he would be joining them at the end of the month.

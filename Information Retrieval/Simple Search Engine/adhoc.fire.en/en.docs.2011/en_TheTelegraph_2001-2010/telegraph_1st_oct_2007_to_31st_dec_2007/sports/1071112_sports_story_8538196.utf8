 New Zealand crash to heaviest defeat
 Dale Steyn completed 10-wicket match haul Johannesburg: Fast bowler Dale Steyn completed a 10-wicket haul to seal South Africas record win in the first Test against New Zealand on Sunday. Steyn, who took five for 34 in the first innings, claimed five for 59 to finish with match figures of 10 for 93 as South Africa wrapped up victory by 358 runs with more than a day to spare. New Zealand, who needed 531 to win, were dismissed for 172 after lunch on the fourth day. The result marked New Zealands heaviest defeat, surpassing the 299 runs Pakistan beat them by in Auckland in 2001. The visitors resumed on 57 for three and they lost their fourth wicket to the ninth ball of the day when Steyn had Scott Styris caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher for 16. Steyn struck again eight overs later when Brendon McCullum, who scored 26, flapped at a delivery outside his off-stump and was caught by Herschelle Gibbs. New Zealand slipped to 109 for six when Michael Papps edged a delivery from fast bowler Jacques Kallis and was caught by AB de Villiers at third slip. Papps, selected as an opening batsman but only able to bat at No.7 after being off the field all day Saturday because of illness, made only five. (AGENCIES)

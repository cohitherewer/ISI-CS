 A former captains journey from a 4-year-old to 98 Tests
	 - Sourav ganguly and his association with eden gardensLOKENDRA PRATAP SAHICalcutta: The Eden is Sourav Gangulys home turf, but the former India captain actually has a rather disappointing record there  a Test average of just 24-plus. Well, the upcoming face-off versus Pakistan gives Sourav the chance  possibly his last at the Eden  to improve on that substantially. Incidentally, the Test (No.2 of the current series) is going to be his 98th. Sourav recently spoke to The Telegraph, before the Board-imposed gag, wherein he talked exclusively about the Eden. The following are excerpts On his earliest memory of the Eden Coming to the ground as a four-year-old to watch the 1976 Test against England I remember Tony Greig was the captain  one can hardly forget somebody so tall  and also recall having been introduced to the manager (the late Ken Barrington) However, I dont remember anything of the match Cant say whether I was overawed as I was too young then. [For the record, India lost by 10 wickets.] On the first time he played at the Eden Versus Orissa, at the U-15 level. I think I got a hundred On his first appearance for India (the 1996-97 Test against South Africa) at the Eden Id come off an injury (torn calf muscle) and didnt do well Id gone into the Test without match practice That we also lost makes for a rather painful memory. On his most special moment at the Eden Winning the 2001 Test versus Australia That will always be memorable Also, beating Pakistan in the last Test there (2005) On his worst moment (After a pause) Probably that 1996 Test against South Africa It had been billed as a big moment for me, playing at home after all, but I scored 6 and 0 and the team lost. On whether theres an Eden-specific regret Not playing the one-dayer versus South Africa two years ago I wasnt even in the squad. On the performances which, in his book, stand out Both happened in the same Test  (V.V.S.) Laxmans 281 and Harbhajan Singhs match haul of 13 for 198 That Test (against Australia, in 2001) wont be forgotten. On whether, because of the conditions, players need to do anything different at the Eden Not really In fact, players look forward to walking out at the Eden One of Brian Laras regrets is that he didnt play a Test there On the Eden buzz (Smiles) Difficult to describe I hope the fans get to see good cricket and, more important, another Indian win. On whether theres more pressure on him during a Test or one-dayer at the Eden It was so during my first Test, not afterwards Having played at the Eden at different levels, Im familiar with the ground Over the years, Ive been comfortable. On the debate over whether an Indo-Pak series is bigger than the Ashes Ive been approaching every Indo-Pak Test as just another match I dont look at any series as being smaller or bigger than anything. Finally, on his thoughts as he nears his 100th Test Im aware the milestone is getting close One dreams of playing for the country and, then, playing for as long as possible... Getting to 100 Tests is going to be an achievement, but every Test is special Every Test holds meaning (After a pause) While theres definitely some excitement, Im still some matches away

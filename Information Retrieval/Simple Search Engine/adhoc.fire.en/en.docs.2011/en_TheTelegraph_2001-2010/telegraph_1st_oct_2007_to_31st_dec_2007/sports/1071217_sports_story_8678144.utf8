 Kumble pins hopes on seniors

Mumbai: India Test captain Anil Kumble is relying on seniors to deliver the goods and stop the Aussie juggernaut. 
The veterans, for whom this may well be the last tour Down Under, will board the Australia-bound flight on Monday and it will be up to them to stop Ricky Pontings men who have won 14 Tests in row, or so feels Kumble. 
If you look at our middle-order, we have about 30,000 Test runs there. Thats a lot of runs. For some of the senior players this will be the last tour of Australia. Whatever comes our way, we will handle it, Kumble said during a press conference on Sunday. 
For the veteran leg-spinner and his senior mates such as Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman, this could also be the last chance to secure the seemingly unattainable  a series win in Australia. 
We came very close to winning the series on the last tour (2003-04). We have the experience and the potential to go out there and do it, said Kumble. The tour starts with the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. 
According to the captain, most of the players in the squad have played in Australia before and that should be of great help in tackling the Brett Lees on green tops. 
We know what to expect. It will be a challenging tour and we are ready for it. We have won the one-day and Test series against Pakistan, said Kumble, who was felicitated for completing 550 wickets in Tests at the BCCI annual awards function on Monday. 
Though questions have been raised over Indias ability to pick up 20 wickets in a Test against Australia, Kumble seemed confident. 
If our batsmen can put up runs on the board and do that consistently, we do have the bowling attack to pick up 20 wickets. 
On whether the inexperience of pacers such as Ishant Sharma and Pankaj Singh will be the deciding factor, Indias Test captain said: We have the required experience in Zaheer (Khan), R.P. Singh. (Irfan) Pathan has played in Australia before. Ishant is very promising. Pankaj is also exciting. Hes tall and hits the deck hard. 
On whether he missed a left-arm spinner, Kumble said, We have picked the two best spinners. Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) has done well. On the previous tour, Kumble had bagged 24 wickets. 
Asked if he would try his hand at seam bowling again as he did in Bangalore to get India within sniffing distance of a win against Pakistan, Kumble said with a chuckle, Surely, if the wicket is slow. 
The captain firmly backed Sehwag and said the explosive opener, who has a meaty average against Australia, could provide India the attacking option. 
Hes a quality player And we have shown our confidence in him by selecting him.

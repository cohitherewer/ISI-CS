 Ruthless Australians make it 15 in a row

 Ricky Ponting and Brad Hogg celebrate the dismissal of Sourav Ganguly on Saturday 
Melbourne: The famed Indian batsmen surrendered meekly to suffer one of their heaviest Test defeats as a ruthless Australia crushed them by 337 runs with one full day to spare to take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series Saturday. 
Chasing a seemingly insurmountable 499, the Indians were skittled out for a paltry 161 in just 74 overs to give Australia their 15th consecutive Test win. 
Only VVS Laxman (42) and Sourav Ganguly (40) provided a semblance of resistance. The Indians lost the bottom half for just 17 runs with the last four wickets falling dramatically in a span of four runs. 
Australia will now seek to equal their world record of 16 consecutive Test victories when the two teams brace up for the second Test in Sydney from January 2. 
For the hosts, Mitchell Johnson (3/21) turned out to be the most successful bowler, while Brad Hogg (2/51) and Brett Lee (2/43) also had their share of the spoils. Australia keeper Adam Gilchrist, with 399 dismissals, surpassed fellow Australian keeper Ian Healy (395). 
Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni proved Indias weak link in the lower half and it wouldnt surprise many if Virender Sehwag plays the second Test. 
Meanwhile, Man of the Match Matthew Hayden admitted that he is nursing a sore back but assured that he would be fit for the second Test in Sydney.
GILCHRIST-SPEAK 
Its a terrific feeling to get past another milestone... Its more pleasing because I kept well on a difficult wicket and contributed to our big win... Early on, one did have some self doubts, but the encouragement from Rodney Marsh and Ian Healy helped me along the way... I dont regret moving from New South Wales to Western Australia (in the early 1990s) for the sake of my career...

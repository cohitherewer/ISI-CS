Brazil were named on Tuesday as the host for the 2014 World Cup. Here are some facts about Brazilian football:  Brazil have won the World Cup a record five times  in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002. The 1970 team is considered to be one of the best teams the world has ever seen. Brazil have also been runner-ups twice  in 1950 and 1998.  Football was introduced to Brazil in the 1890s by Charles Miller, the son of a Scottish expatriate railway engineer, who had played the game at school in Britain. The square outside Sao Paulos municipal Pacaembu Stadium is named after him.  Brazils worst World Cup experience was their 1-2 defeat in the deciding match of the 1950 World Cup by Uruguay in the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. The Uruguayans stunned the world record 199,000 in the stadium and millions across the country into silence. The event is known as the Maracanazo  the Maracana Blow.  The Selecao, as the national team is known, adopted their famed strip of yellow shirts with green trim and blue shorts after the Maracanazo. They are the colours on the Brazilian flag.

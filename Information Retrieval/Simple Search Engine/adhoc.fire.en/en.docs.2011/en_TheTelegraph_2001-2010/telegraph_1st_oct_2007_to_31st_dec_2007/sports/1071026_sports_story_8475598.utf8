 Pakistan will miss Inzamam, says Harbhajan
 Harbhajan Singh Jalandhar: Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh on Thursday fired the first salvo at Pakistan, saying absence of their former captain Inzamam-ul Haq would give hosts India an edge in the upcoming Test and one-day series. Pakistan, led by young captain Shoaib Malik, will play a full-fledged series of five one-dayers and three Tests against India from November 5. No doubt Pakistan are a tough side but without star batsman Inzamam, who recently retired from the international arena, we will definitely have an edge over our arch-rivals, Harbhajan said on the sidelines of a promotional here. Inzamam had the capability to turn a match around under any circumstances His absence would definitely be useful for us, he added. The off-spinner, however, said India would not take things lightly with allrounder Shahid Afridi and prolific batsman Mohammed Yousuf still around. Pakistan have star players such as Afridi, Yousuf and Malik We will have to play at our best to win, he said. Harbhajan said it is important for the home side to win and be in a positive frame of mind ahead of the tour Down Under. Victory against Pakistan would definitely boost the morale of the team and set a tone for series against Australia, the off-spinner said. On the spat between Indian and Australian players during the recently concluded ODI series, the Punjab bowler revealed that Sreesanth and he had reacted to the Australian playerss comments and would continue to do that in the future as well. We will give a fitting reply to their aggression. Australian players try to put opponents under pressure through their comments and gestures This does not work What works is their performance, he said.  (PTI)

The first three legs of the World Cup were held in Ulsan (South Korea), Varese (Italy) and Antalya (Turkey). Dola had logged 12 points in the Ulsan leg. The Arjuna awardee was tense and nervous before setting off for Dubai on November 22. Having changed her equipment owing to a crack in the handle, she struggled with the new one, recalled brother Rahul, who trains with her at Tata Archery Academy (TAA) in Jamshedpur. Didi was tense So we would practise under lights very late. That was natural since she just got one day with the new equipment, Rahul said from Jamshedpur. But I was confident especially when she called me in the afternoon to convey the news of her entering the final She promised a surprise gift for me. Ill go to receive her tomorrow (Sunday) evening, an elated Rahul added. Not surprisingly, for TAA too, it was time to celebrate. Its a big achievement and this boosts our medal chances in the Beijing Olympics. Dola has made us all proud, said coach Sanjeeva Singh, who had trained Dola from 1988-2001. Dola has also trained under Dharmendra Tiwari and Purnima Mahto who, incidentally, is accompanying her in Dubai. She started training under Korean coach Lim Chae Woong from 2004.

 Barreto to play today
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Mohun Bagan launch their I-League campaign when they take on JCT at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. If my boys can play to their abilities, there is no reason why we wont get full points from this match, Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira said after practice. Jose Ramirez Barreto, who emerged as the highest scorer in the CFL Premier Division with 12 goals, confirmed that he was fit and would play alongside Bhaichung Bhutia. There will also be P.C. Lalawmpuia to assist Bhiachung and Barreto, perhaps the most lethal combination in the League. Bagans midfield comprising Brazilian Douglas da Silva, Shanmugam Venkatesh, James Singh and Dharamjit Singh are strong on paper. But the defence would be a major concern for the three-time champions as N.S. Manju will have to sit out with a groin injury. The CFL Premier Division champions would largely depend on their other foreign recruit Peter Odafe along with Bijoy Basfore, Sanjeev Maria and Rauf Khan to keep their fort intact. On the other hand, JCT will begin as the underdogs. Its going to be tough but we are playing will, coach Sukhwinder Singh said.

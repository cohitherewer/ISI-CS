 Justine Henin of Belgium returns a forehand to Maria Sharapova of Russia during their WTA Championships final in Madrid on Sunday. (Reuters) Madrid: Justine Henin rallied to beat Maria Sharapova 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 on Sunday to win the WTA Championships in the longest three-set final of the tournaments history. Henin won on her fifth match point, breaking Sharapova after the Russian hit a drop shot into the net. The match lasted a record three hours and 24 minutes. Henin, who won her 25th straight match, saved five of Sharapovas six break chances in the final set  and 14 of 18 overall  to become the sixth player to defend the WTAs season-ending championship. It was also her 10th title of the year. Sharapova, who came into the tournament after a long injury lay-off caused by a shoulder injury, took the first set after breaking in the 12th game on her eighth set point. Henin then corrected her erratic serve to secure an important break in the 11th game of the second set. Earlier, Cara Black and Liezel Huber won their ninth title of the year when they beat Katarina Srebotnik and Ai Sugiyama 5-7, 6-3, 1-0 (10-8) in the doubles final. The pair, whose titles this year also include the Australian Open and Wimbledon, fought back from a set down to level the match in the second and edged the deciding tie-break to clinch victory. It was the first time that Black, who hails from Zimbabwe, has won the event after finishing runner-up five times over the past six years. The pair finished the season as the joint-top ranked players in the world.  (AGENCIES)

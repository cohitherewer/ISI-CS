 Federation seeks Abraham touch
JOHN ABRAHAMOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT John AbrahamNew Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has approached film star John Abraham to inaugurate the Professional League in Goa on November 24. According to AIFF sources, the Bollywood star is yet to confirm but the federation officials are confident about his presence during the opener between Dempo and Salgaocar at the Nehru Stadium.The Pro League will be inaugurated during the film festival in Goa. All the top stars will be available there, said an AIFF official. AIFF, whose president Priyaranjan Das Munshi is also the union minister for information and broadcasting, is encouraged by the fact that the actor has starred in a football-centric movie alongside Bipasha Basu. The movie is set to be released on November 23 and the AIFF is hoping John Abraham chooses the Pro League as an ideal and realistic publicity pad. This could tempt the actor and win over new audiences for Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal, shot on location at Manchester Uniteds home ground, Old Trafford.

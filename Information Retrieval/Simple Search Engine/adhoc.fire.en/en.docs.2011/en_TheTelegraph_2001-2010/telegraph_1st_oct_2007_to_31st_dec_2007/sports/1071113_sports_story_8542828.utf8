 Theres room to improve: Henin 
 - World No. 1 claims 10 tour titles in a year 		Justine Henin 		 with the trophy 		 in Madrid 		 on SundayMadrid: It was the final they wanted and it did not fail to live up to expectations. Maria Sharapova and Justine Henin pushed each other to the limit on Sunday but in the end it was the Belgian who wanted it most. Henin, the defending champion, became the first female tennis player to earn more than $5 million (about 2.4 million) in a season after she secured a 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 victory at the WTA Championships. With the withdrawal of Serena Williams, the retirement of Jelena Jankovic and some one-sided pool matches, this showpiece event had failed to live up to the hype that comes with a tournament involving the top eight players in the world. But it burst into life on Sunday with those lucky enough to be at the Pabellde Cristal  packed to the rafters for the first time during the week of the tournament  witnessing one of the most dramatic matches in history. It was a year to the day since the last meeting between these two, a remarkably long time when you consider that they are involved at the business end of tournaments all year round, but they did not waste their time in resuming hostilities. Their games are like night and day. Sharapova is all about power, hitting her groundstrokes from side to side like only those brought up on the courts of Nick Bollettieri know how. Henin is about spin, angles and that beautiful backhand, but her fluidity deserted her for much of Sunday. The world No. 1 was edged out by Sharapova in the first set as she experienced problems on her serve and struggled to cope with her opponents powerful ground strokes. She hit back in the second and then found another gear in the third to clinch a thrilling victory in three hours and 24 minutes. She pushed me a lot and we were both pretty nervous at the end in the first set, said Henin. She was better at that time but I started to play much better at the end of the second set. I was aggressive and I played down the line. The Belgian has claimed nine other titles this year, including Grand Slam victories in France and the US Open, and ended the year on a 25-match winning streak after she became the first woman since Steffi Graf in 1989 to go undefeated in the second half of the season, post Wimbledon. Henin also became the first player to claim 10 tour titles in a year since Martina Hingis won 12 in 1997. Yet Henin believes there is plenty of room for improvement in her game. I think I can still improve a lot, in my attitude especially, the 25-year-old Belgian. I wouldnt say I played my best tennis, I was just fighting a lot. I played with my heart and it was great because that brings a lot of emotion. But I have to keep improving my aggressive game, moving forward and taking my opportunities. She said her sights were now set on reclaiming the Australian Open title she won in 2004 after missing this years tournament because of personal problems following her separation from her husband. I was sad I wasnt in Australia this year and I hope to take my revenge in a few weeks, she said. Its time now for a good rest, time for holiday and two weeks off and then Ill start my preparations. Henin has recovered from the marital breakdown and ridden the emotion of a family reunion after seven years estrangement. Its the last day of the season, the last match and 25 wins was great motivation. Its been fantastic and emotional and I just wanted to enjoy this last moment, said Henin, who rushed straight up into the stands to celebrate with family and back-up team. It was a notable effort too by Sharapova, who has been struggling with a long-term shoulder problem. Its been a pretty rough year for me with all of these injuries, one after another. Its an honour to play against her (Henin). I hope we can play a few more times. I hope I can get my revenge a few more times, she said. I wasnt sure I would play here and I only came here hoping to get as many matches as possible, and this happens. Its more than I expected. (AGENCIES)

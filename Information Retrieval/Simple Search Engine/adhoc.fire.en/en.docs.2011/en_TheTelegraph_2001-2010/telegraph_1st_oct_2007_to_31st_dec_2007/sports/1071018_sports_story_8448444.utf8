 Lopez stuns Ferrer
 Feliciano Lopez returns the ball against David Ferrer during their match in the Madrid Masters on Wednesday. (AP) Madrid: Wild card Feliciano Lopez delivered a blow to seventh seed David Ferrers bid to qualify for the season-ending Masters Cup with a 7-6, 7-5 win in his opening match in the Madrid Masters on Wednesday. Ferrer started well and looked to be in control of the all-Spanish duel when he took a 4-1 lead in the opening set, but the tall, powerful Lopez bounced back to edge the set on a tie-break. There was little to separate the two players in the second, but Lopez looked more comfortable on the fast hard court and put Ferrer under pressure on the key points to book his place in the third round. Last years losing finalist Fernando Gonzalez had to dig deep to record a 7-6, 7-5 win over the combative Nicolas Almagro in his second-round match. On Tuesday, British No. 1 Andy Murray blew away Argentine 15th seed Juan Ignacio Chela 6-1, 6-3 to reach the third round. Earlier, Argentine Juan Monaco upset 11th-seed Tommy Haas of Germany 6-4 7-5 in the second round.  (REUTERS)

 Bhaichungs gift for wife Madhuri

A STAFF REPORTER 
Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia might have scored over 250 goals, but his winner against East Bengal on Sunday would have a special place in his heart. According to him, it was his birthday gift to wife Madhuri. 
Today is my wifes birthday. She asked me in the morning wheres my gift? I told her, let me score a goal against East Bengal and it will be my gift to you. Had I not scored today, I might have had to buy something for her, a smiling Mohun Bagan captain said after the match. 
Describing the win as an important one in their I-League campaign, Bhaichung said: It will keep us afloat in the competition. Practically speaking, we are not giving any serious thought to the championship but its important to keep the winning habit intact. 
The team is in a better shape we need to be positive and assess our situation match by match, he added. 
East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya rued that another silly defensive lapse cost him the match. Im not thinking about relegation but our chances of staying in the title hunt are almost over. The target is to gain as many points as possible and finish as close to the top as possible, he said.

 Tiwary puts Bengal in control on Day I
A STAFF REPORTER Manoj Tiwary at the Eden on Sunday Calcutta: When at the Eden, the one batsman who naturally comes to mind is that of Very Very Special Laxman and his vintage 281 on March 11, 2001. The same venue on Sunday found a hero in Manoj Tiwary against Laxmans side, displaying an array of strokes which reminded one of the classy Hyderabadi batsman. Tiwarys unbeaten 147 (4x19, 6x2) not only helped Bengal take Day I initiative against Hyderabad with 289 for five at stumps in their Ranji Trophy Super League group B tie, but he also staked his claim for a berth in the national side. Though Laxmans knock against the Aussies in the second innings of that famous Steve Waughs juggernaut-halting Test remains unparalleled, Tiwarys effort could come as close as to that, the difference in competition notwithstanding. Laxman himself acknowledged Tiwarys performance. Lets not compare my innings with his But having watched him bat freely from the slips, it felt that Tiwarys knock was a good one, Laxman told The Telegraph. The 21-year-old never looked tired and beaten, despite the fact that he had undergone a shoulder surgery not long ago. Tiwarys flamboyance took a toll on Hyderabad left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha who was touted to exploit the under-prepared track. Laxman, expectedly, brought the Cuttack-based spinner in the ninth over after Bengal elected to bat. He did give a breakthrough taking opener Amitava Chakravarty. But the tweakers dominance came to an end when Tiwary joined Anustup Majumdar in the middle. He swept and drove Ojha at will, hitting eight fours and one six off the spinner. Off another left-arm spinner, Lalith Mohan, the Bengal batsman hit one six and six fours, including the one which helped him cross hundred. Hyderabad rejoiced briefly when off-spinner Amol Shinde took two wickets in two balls  which included new Bengal skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla (0) six overs after tea. Having lasted two minutes and one ball, Shuklas initiation as skipper was forgettable, though he later denied he was under any pressure. It happens in a match. Zindagi mein kabhi bhi mein pressure mein nahin aaya, said Shukla. Wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha  making Ranji debut as the replacement of former skipper Deep Dasgupta  started off with a blazing boundary off Ojha. He and Tiwary, having played cricket at under-19 level together, got into the act with an unbeaten 68 runs off 20 overs.

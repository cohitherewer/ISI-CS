 Bolton hold Bayern 2-2 
London: Struggling Bolton Wanderers held European soccer aristocrats Bayern Munich to a 2-2 draw in Uefa Cup group F on Thursday. Bolton, second from bottom in the English Premier League, shocked Bayern with an eighth minute opener in Munich, the first goal in five years for defender Ricardo Gardner. Bayern, past winners of four European Cups, a Cup Winners Cup and a Uefa Cup, replied with goals from Germany striker Lukas Podolski Cup either side of halftime. But Kevin Davies made it a night to savour for new coach Gary Megson with an 82nd minute strike against the run of play. Bayern stay top of the group with four points from two games. Aris Salonika jumped to second after beating Red Star Belgrade 3-0 and Bolton are third a point behind. It was a good night for English clubs playing away and new coaches. Juande Ramos, who steered Sevilla to successive victories in the Uefa Cup final in the last two seasons, saw his new Tottenham Hotspur team ease to a 2-0 victory at Hapoel Tel Aviv in group G. First half goals from Robbie Keane, who scored with a 26th minute volley, and Dimitar Berbatov, who struck with a 31st minute header, put Spurs in complete command. What little resistance Hapoel offered effectively ended with the 50th minute dismissal of midfielder Gal Shish for a second yellow card. Girondins Bordeaux top group H after beating Austria Vienna 2-1 away. Helsingborg of Sweden are second after 36-year-old striker Henrik Larsson spearheaded them to a 3-2 victory over Galatasaray in Turkey. (Reuters)

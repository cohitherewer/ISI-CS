 Rashid best in Faldo series 

New Delhi: Delhi teenager Rashid Khan was crowned Faldo Series Asia champion for 2007 at Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen. 
The 16-year-old carded a six-under 66 on the Faldo Course on Saturday for a 54-hole total of 205 to finish five shots ahead of fellow- Indian Rahul Bakshi (63) and Chan Shih Chang of Chinese Taipei. 
Although Rahul finished second, his round of 63 was a new course record. 
An elated Rashid said: I am absolutely delighted to win and to do it with Nick Faldo watching is extremely exciting. Nick told us to be positive and play with a smile on our faces and that is exactly what I did. I have never played so well. 
As well as collecting the Faldo Series Asia trophy from Faldo, the youngster also received an invitation to the European Grand Final of the Faldo Series 2008, R amp;A world amateur golf ranking points, a place in the Volvo Masters of Asia 2008 and a scholarship to Stage I of the Asian Tour Qualifying School. 
Faldo was impressed with Rashid. I would like to congratulate Rashid on becoming a worthy champion of the Faldo Series Asia 2007. (PTI)

 Roger Federer the master, again
 Roger Federer celebrates with the trophy on Sunday Shanghai: Top-ranked Roger Federer won his fourth Masters Cup title on Sunday, overwhelming No. 6 David Ferrer 6-2, 6-3, 6-2. It was the third consecutive dominating performance by Federer, who won his 53rd career title  including eight this year  and ran his record against Ferrer to 8-0. Only three others  Ilie Nastase, Ivan Lendl and Pete Sampras  have won the season-ending tournament four times or more. It was Federers 70th career final against just nine for Ferrer, highlighting the gulf between them. It was a nice victory, proving to myself and the world that I can do it over and over again, said Federer, who collected $1.2 million (euro 820,000) and a new car for the win. This is the year-end tournament that only the best can make it to. For me to win is a fantastic experience. Im looking forward to a vacation and then come back hopefully stronger next year. The Spaniard was simply no match for Federers blend of spins, power and volleying skills, managing only 10 winners to 38 unforced errors as he was forced to try to do too much with Federer getting everything back. Federer had 30 winners and 29 unforced errors. Next up is an exhibition in Malaysia against Pete Sampras, who holds the record of 14 Grand Slam titles that Federer is chasing. The Swiss star will begin pursuit of No. 13 at the Australian Open. Swiss fans in the chilly but packed 15,000-seat stadium said it all with a banner reading, Shhh! Quiet! Genius at work. Federer faced a break point at 2-2, 30-40 in the first set, then ran off 18 of the next 19 points. The streak also started a stretch in which Federer won 30 of 33 service points through the end of the second set. It seemed that no matter how well Ferrer played, Federer was just better, never giving up on a single shot, finding angles where none seemed to exist and moving even better than usual. Ferrer, constantly trying to pick on Federers backhand, hit two amazing winners while serving at 3-3 in the second set. Federer still broke him. While Ferrer was stunned, so was the generally pro-Federer crowd. As they watched in awe, the fans slowly switched allegiances, hoping Ferrer could make a match of it. Not a chance. I surprise myself at times, Federer said. Ive always had a tendency to all of a sudden go in streaks. Once you get on a roll, its so hard for the opponent to come back into it. I dont allow them. I can mix it up... This is my big strength. I hope I can keep that going for many more years to come, obviously. With Ferrer serving at 3-5, the normally placid Federer pumped his fist after hitting a backhand cross-court winner to end a long rally. When he sent a backhand long on set point two games later, Ferrer smashed his racket on the court, nearly breaking it in two. Playing in his biggest-ever final and first Masters Cup, Ferrer admitted he was a bit nervous  and Federer made sure he never got comfortable. I try to do my best. I fight, said Ferrer, who had been undefeated in four matches, beating Nadal, third-ranked Novak Djokovic and Roddick along the way. But Federer, hes playing very, very well. He has no weak point. Roger is the best in history. Ferrer got one last shot with three break points as Federer served at 1-1 in the third set, but couldnt convert. Federer then broke him the next game on a forehand passing shot on the run. Serving at 2-5, Ferrer double-faulted at deuce, and Federer finished it off with a forehand across court that went untouched. Federer, who already clinched the world No. 1 race for the fourth year in a row, lost his first round-robin match, then ran off four in a row, looking sharper each match. In the doubles final, top-seeded Mark Knowles of the Bahamas and Daniel Nestor of Canada beat Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Julian Knowle of Austria 6-2, 6-3. The worlds top-ranked team of twins Bob and Mike Bryan pulled out of the tournament because of an elbow injury to Mike but they hope to play when the US faces Russia in the Davis Cup final at the end of the month. The Masters Cup will again be played in Shanghai next year, but it will move to London in 2009 for four years and be renamed the ATP World Tour Finals.  (AGENCIES)

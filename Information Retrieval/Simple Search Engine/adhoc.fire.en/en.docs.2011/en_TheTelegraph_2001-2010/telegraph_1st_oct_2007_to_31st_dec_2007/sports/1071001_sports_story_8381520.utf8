 India take on Al Naser today
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Following their recent Nehru Cup triumph, the Indians will play their first match on Monday night when they take on Dubais Al Naser in a friendly encounter. The match is part of Indias preparations for the first round World Cup qualifier against Lebanon to be played on October 8 (Beirut) and Chennai (October 28). The Indians are currently camping in Dubai for a training-cum-exposure trip. According to information received here, two players  defender N.S. Manju and midfielder Climax Lawrence  who played a crucial role in Nehru Cup victory, are unlikely to figure in the starting XI. Coach Bob Houghton may field Samir Naik and Mehrajuddin Wadao in their places. Both Lawrence and Manju are nursing injuries and practising hard to regain their fitness. Like in all friendlies, Houghton is expected to try out all his 23 players before finalising his squad of 18 for the Lebanon tie.

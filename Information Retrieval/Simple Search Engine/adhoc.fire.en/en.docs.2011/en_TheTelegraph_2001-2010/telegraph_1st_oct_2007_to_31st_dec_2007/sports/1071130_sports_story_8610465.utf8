 Mohun Bagan lose again 
A STAFF REPORTER Viva Keralas scorers Wisdom (left) and Tunde on Thursday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Bob Houghton hit the nail on the head when he said that Viva Keralas foreign trio had been the dominant force in Thursday evenings ONGC I-League clash against Mohun Bagan. Nigerian Baba Tunde opened the scoring and Ghanaian Wisdom Abbey netted a brace as the rookies conjured a dream 3-1 verdict at the Salt Lake Stadium. Tunde and Abbey terrorised the Mohun Bagan defence into submission with some pacy play, scoring twice in the first 25 minutes. Mohun Bagan pulled one back late in the second half through substitute Ishfaq Ahmed but Wisdoms second strike minutes from the final whistle buried the three-time champions. Two losses in two games, and both at home. Three-time champions Mohun Bagan couldnt have had a worse start. With Jose Ramirez Barreto unfit to play, Mohun Bagan were left with just a couple of foreigners in their ranks  Peter Odafe and Douglas da Silva. Both started in defence and cut sorry figures. In the 14th minute, Douglas let an aerial ball beat him and land near Wisdom, whose square pass was promptly pushed into the goal by Tunde. Ten minutes later, bigger tragedy struck the green-and-maroons. Goalkeeper Shilton Paul rolled the ball towards Odafe, who let it deflect to an unmarked Wisdom. The tall striker, 20 yards from the goal, noticed that Shilton was out of position and placed his grounder to perfection. Mohun Bagans midfield, non-functional for most of the match  more so after James Singh was pushed back to defence after the early goals  had a bright spell in the last quarter. Ishfaq, who replaced Dharamjit Singh  one of many who were off colour  connected a Lalkamal Bhowmick cross nicely with his head to reduce the margin. Within a minute, Ishfaq nearly scored again with a grounder. He then laid open one for Lalkamal to unleash a scorching left-footer which ricocheted off the base of the post. Bhaichung then saw his header being blocked by custodian M.V. Nelson. This is our worst performance this season, Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira later said. I dont want to point out any single player, the whole team performed poorly. We gave away two goals and missed many chances, he added. TEAMS Viva Kerala: M.V.

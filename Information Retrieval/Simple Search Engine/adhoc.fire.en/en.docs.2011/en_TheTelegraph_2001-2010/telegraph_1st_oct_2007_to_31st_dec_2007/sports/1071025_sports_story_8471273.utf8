 Asif unlikely for last two one-dayers
Multan: Pakistan fast bowler Mohammed Asif is unlikely to play in the last two one-day Internationals against South Africa as the national selectors are keen on giving him a long rest before next months much-anticipated tour of India. The fast bowler has already missed the first three matches of the series owing to an elbow injury after breaking down while bowling in the second Test against South Africa earlier this month in Lahore. He is not certain to play in the last two games because we need him in India for the Tests and one-day Internationals and he is a proven performer, Pakistan chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said on Wednesday. Pakistan, who lead South Africa 2-1 in the one-day series, are due to play three Tests and five ODI in India. The hosts are also monitoring the fitness of left-arm spinner Abdul Rehman, who has played a vital role in his teams victories in the last two one-dayers against South Africa. A team official said Rehman was suffering from a groin problem and the players availability for Fridays match would be confirmed closer to the contest.  (REUTERS)

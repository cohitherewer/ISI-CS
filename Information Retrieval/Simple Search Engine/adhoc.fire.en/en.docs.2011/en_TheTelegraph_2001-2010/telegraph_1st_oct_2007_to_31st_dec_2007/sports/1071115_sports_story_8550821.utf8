 Biswals take is very different
 Biswal Ranjib Biswal, the Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) president, has reacted strongly to Greg Chappells allegation that the assault on him in Bhubaneswar was racist and that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had engineered a cover-up. Biswal, also one of the five senior national selectors, spoke to The Telegraph from Mumbai on Wednesday afternoon. The following are excerpts: The man who attacked Greg belonged to a political outfit and he did so for publicity I reject the charge that there was a racism angle In fact, the Team India physio (John Gloster), physical trainer (Greg King) and the-then biomechanist (Ian Frazer) are foreigners and all were there as well From what I remember, no cameraperson could record the incident, but we believed Greg when he said hed been punched on the jaw The police acted promptly and the person was behind bars for a month or so Im also surprised at the allegation of a cover-up If anything, its the BCCI which did a cover-up when it stood by Greg after hed made an ungentlemanly gesture at the crowd outside the Eden before the (November 2005) ODI against South Africa If there was racism, would Greg have come back to India and taken up the Rajasthan Cricket Association Academy job (in Jaipur)? That question is echoing across India. Equally, nobody doubts that there actually had been a major security lapse in the Orissa capital. LPS

 No Test berth for Strauss 
Giles MoleEngland opener Andrew Strauss has been dropped for the forthcoming three-Test tour of Sri Lanka. The 30-year-old Middlesex batsman, who has averaged just 27 over the past year, paid the price for poor form, despite recently being awarded a new central contract. There was no recall for Surreys Mark Ramprakash. England have named just 15 in their travelling party, with four uncapped players. Nottinghamshires Graeme Swann was rewarded for his performance in the recent ODI series against Sri Lanka, with the second spinners slot behind Monty Panesar. Pace bowler Stuart Broad, also of Nottinghamshire, got an opportunity to push for a first Test cap, while Essex all-rounder Ravi Bopara was also included. Durham wicketkeeper Phil Mustard made the cut along with a fit-again Matt Prior. Pace bowler Steve Harmison, who has not played since a hernia operation in the summer, was included but must first prove his fitness in a short stint in South African domestic cricket. England chairman of selectors David Graveney said: We have chosen a balanced squad which includes a number of experienced Test players, together with several young players who performed well in the recent one-day series in Sri Lanka. Harmison is scheduled to play two four-day matches for Highveld Lions in mid-November and he will join the tour party in Sri Lanka, to him proving he has regained form and fitness following his back injury in the summer. Strauss needs to recover his best form and he has not been included in the squad on this occasion. Graveney made it clear Strauss remains a contender for the second half of Englands winter. He said: We fully anticipate that he will have a major role to play with England in the next 12 months, and he will be considered for the tour of New Zealand in the new year. Owais Shah and Bopara are both fine players of spin bowling, and their performances for the one-day side recently have demonstrated that they have the temperament required to succeed at the highest level. We have chosen Mustard as our number two wicketkeeper for the tour. Having recently toured Sri Lanka with the one-day squad, Phil is familiar with the conditions and will be ideally placed to deputise for Matt Prior should the situation arise. Swann made an excellent all-round contribution to the one-day squads series win in Sri Lanka and will come into consideration for a place in our start-ing line-up at those venues where we require two spinners. The England performance squad will be in India from mid-November for four weeks and will provide nominated stand-by players in key positions to cover for any injuries to the Test squad in Sri Lanka. THE SQUAD Michael Vaughan (captain, Yorkshire), Alastair Cook (Essex), Ian Bell (Warwickshire), Kevin Pietersen (Hampshire), Paul Collingwood (Durham), Owais Shah (Middlesex), Ravi Bopara (Essex), Matt Prior (Sussex), Phil Mustard (Durham), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), James Anderson (Lancashire), Matthew Hoggard (Yorkshire), Monty Panesar (Northamptonshire), Ryan Sidebottom (Nottinghamshire), Graeme Swann (Nottinghamshire).

 Award catches Tiwary unawares

A STAFF REPORTER
Calcutta: Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary was taken aback when he came to know that he had been nominated for the best under-22 cricketer award replacing Delhis promising Abhinav Bali who had joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 
The BCCI, at its working committee meeting in Mumbai on Sunday, decided to replace Bali with Tiwary as the recipient of the M. A. Chidambaram Trophy, which carries a purse of Rs 50,000. Balis name was struck off at the last minute after it was discovered that he had joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 
I am really inspired on getting this award But I dont want an award for one year. I want to continue playing like this every season and get an award each time, Tiwary told The Telegraph on Sunday evening. Tiwary, however, was unaware of the announcement till this newspaper conveyed the news. 
Tiwary sounded like a senior pro when asked about his role in the team. Last time I played my own game but this time I will have to score runs and guide others who are yet to gain experience, Tiwary said. 
Tiwary knows well that the match against Uttar Pradesh will be crucial as chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar will be present at the Eden to watch him and Suresh Raina. 
Tiwary ruled out any rivalry with Raina for a berth in the ODI squad Down Under. 
I dont see any rivalry between us Rather I would like to perform in front of the chief selector and I am confident of that, Tiwary remarked. 
According to Raina, though, its good to have a healthy rivalry between Tiwary and him. It helps to perform better.

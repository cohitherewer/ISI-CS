 I was counting hours: Inzy
Lahore: If it can happen to Don Bradman, it can happen to anyone. The stage was set for Inzamam-ul Haq to make a glorious, record-breaking, farewell to international cricket Friday when he walked to the crease on the last day of the Pakistan-South Africa second Test. He needed just three runs to break Javed Miandads Pakistan record of 8,832 Test runs. But five minutes later he was on his way back to the pavilion. It may not have been as dramatic as Bradmans duck in his final innings in 1948 that cost him a Test average of 100, but Inzy was every bit as disappointed. It is disappointing not to have got a big score in my last match. I wanted to play aggressively and maybe I could have won the match for Pakistan, but sadly that was not the case today (Friday), Inzamam told a news conference. It was a very emotional moment for me going out to bat one last time for Pakistan. It was very difficult for me to spend these last five days in the dressing room. I was counting hours today. I am sad but there are no regrets because I have enjoyed a lot of success and got a lot of love from the people. The former captain and veteran of 120 Tests and 378 ODIs said: It would have been nice to have got the record but I was not particularly gunning for it because it belongs to a man who was a better player and from whom I learnt a lot about batting. So perhaps it is best the record remains with him. It was like yesterday when I began my one-day International career from this very ground in 1991, Inzamam said.  (AGENCIES)

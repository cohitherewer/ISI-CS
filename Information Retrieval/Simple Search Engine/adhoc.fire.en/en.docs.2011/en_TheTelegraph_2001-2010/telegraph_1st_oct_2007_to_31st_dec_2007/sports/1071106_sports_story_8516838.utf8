 Factors which may prove decisive today
For the pundits and public alike, there is no favourite in a derby. However, come Tuesday a host of factors may come into play in deciding the outcome of the second-leg CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium. Heres a look: REINFORCEMENTS: Both teams are going to be boosted by the arrival of India players. While N.S. Manju and Bhaichung Bhutia will strengthen Mohun Bagan, East Bengal will be benefited by Surkumar Singh and Debabrata Roys presence in defence and Rahim Nabi in the midfield. REVENGE THEORY: Revenge is on East Bengals mind. Federation Cup win, it seems, hardly assuaged the pain they had suffered at the hands of Mohun Bagan during the 3-4 loss in the first leg. Mohun Bagan are also aware of their pole position in the home stretch and look to go 2-1 up against the arch-rivals in the ongoing season. BHAICHUNG/ALVITO: The two players who hold the key for Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, respectively. Besides making his Maidan debut this season, Bhaichung is also going to lead Mohun Bagan for the first time in a derby in Calcutta. Incidentally, of the 15 derby goals he has scored, only two have been in the green-and-maroon jersey. Alvito is in excellent shape now and knows quite well that a good derby performance may land him in Bob Houghtons camp anytime. BARRETO/EDMILSON: Their goal-scoring rivalry is the talk of this league. Both have scored 12 goals each in 10 matches, going into Tuesdays crucial tie. Its a healthy competition and Im enjoying it, Barreto said. DOUGLAS: This stout and temperamental Brazilian has an unusual derby record: his team has never lost in these clashes. He has played 10 derbies of which nine were in East Bengal jersey. Its nothing but statistics. I know I have to play well to make my fans smile, he said.TOP 5 TEAMS  Bagan: 27 pts in 11 matches  EB: 25 pts in 11 matches  United SC: 19 pts in 12 matches  Peerless: 15 pts in 12 matches  Md. Sp.: 13 pts in 12 matches

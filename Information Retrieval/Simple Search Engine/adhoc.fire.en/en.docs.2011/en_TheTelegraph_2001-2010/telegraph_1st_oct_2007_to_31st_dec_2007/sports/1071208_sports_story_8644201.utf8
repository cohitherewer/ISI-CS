 CRICKET BRIEFS 

 Boje ready to help
 Delhi Police 
 
	Panchkula: Former South Africa allrounder Nicky Boje is ready to help Delhi Police in the 2000 match-fixing scandal investigation.
 
	 ldquo;I will be more than happy to co-operate with them in whatever way I can hellip; I have nothing to hide, rdquo; said Boje, currently playing for Hyderabad Heroes in the ICL rsquo;s Twenty20 tournament.
 
	 Asked when he would join the investigation, Boje declined any comment.
 
	However, said he was not found guilty by the Kings Commission, that investigated into the matter. ldquo;The fact is that Herschelle Gibbs was found guilty and fined for it. The Commission never found me guilty and that rsquo;s why I was not banned, rdquo; said the player, who is in India for the first time after the scandal came to light in 2000.
 
	 Denying reports of Friday newspapers about him alleging Gibbs of match-fixing, Boje said: ldquo;I only stated the factual position and all that what is on record. I never directly levelled any allegations against Herschelle, rdquo; Boje said on the sidelines of his team rsquo;s practice on Friday.
 Buchanan lauds Gilly
 
	 Melbourne: Former Australian coach John Buchanan has welcomed Michael Clarke rsquo;s elevation to the leading role in Twenty20 side but feels Cricket Australia should not rush to hand him over the vice-captaincy of the ODI and the Test teams until Adam Gilchrist retires.
 
	 Buchanan said Gilchrist rsquo;s presence was required in the Australian team.
 
	 ldquo;Adam is still a person that most people in the team can learn a lot of things from. Having him still in that role of vice-captain is important for the team and also for Ricky Ponting, rdquo; Buchanan said. Buchanan was of the view that time was still not ripe to replace Gilchrist by Clarke. ldquo;At this stage there is still too much to be learned and gained from Adam for that to be rushed, rdquo; he said.
 Russell Tiffin landmark
 
	 Calcutta: Russell Tiffin became the 11th umpire to stand in 100 ODIs when he took the field for the fourth ODI between Zimbabwe and the West Indies at the Queen rsquo;s Sports Club in Bulawayo Friday, says a Staff Reporter.

 Stadium opposed
 
	 Chandigarh: Congress on Friday opposed the proposed construction of a cricket stadium in Bathinda demanding that the fertile land at the location should not be used for commercial purpose.
 
	 The Punjab government is all set to lay the foundation stone of the stadium Saturday. A delegation of Congress MLAs, led by leader of opposition Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, met governor General (retd) S. F. Rodrigues to protest against the handing over of the land belonging to Punjab Agricultural University, which has Rodrigues as its chancellor.

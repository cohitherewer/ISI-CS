 Kumble praises Sourav, Laxman
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Anil Kumble on Monday singled out Sourav Ganguly for special praise for his remarkable performance in the first Test. Speaking to the media after winning his first Test as captain by six wickets at the Kotla, Kumble said he was happy with Souravs allround performance. Whenever Sourav had the ball in his hands, he delivered, Kumble said. With the bat, too, he excelled in the second innings. His 48 runs came at a very crucial time and helped us win. Asked what prompted him to hand over the ball to the former captain during the pre-lunch session on Day IV, Kumble said it wasnt pre-planned as projected by the media. I wanted to change ends and called up Munaf (Patel). Then I thought of Sourav and asked him to handle the new ball for a while. The decision, however, proved to be the turning point. Kumble lauded V.V.S. Laxman for his knock of 72 in the first innings. Laxman, along with Dhoni, brought us back into the game. Laxmans innings was crucial. He is a fantastic player, the captain said. I dont know why there is always a sword hanging over his head. Its really unfortunate. Kumble didnt agree that Pakistan batsmen fell to poor shots. We bowled well and created pressure. It was a low and slow pitch. I am happy we got them inside 250 in both innings. We created that kind of pressure by suffocating them. Zaheer (Khan) bowled exceptionally well from both ends. He got reverse swing. The pressure we created by not giving runs proved crucial, the Indian captain said. On using Harbhajan Singh in short spells, Kumble said: I can put up my hands and say that as a spin bowler I understand the importance of spells. Harbhajan bowled exceptionally well. The wickets he took were crucial. It was not easy to bowl on this pitch and you have to rotate the bowlers.

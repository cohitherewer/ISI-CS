 Nightmarish return for victors
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: They hoped for a heroes welcome. Instead they returned home with a nightmare. Bengal under-16 national football team, which reached Howrah Station on Tuesday afternoon, had little to cheer about despite lifting the Mir Iqbal Trophy for the 12th time in Haldwani. Goalkeeper Nasir Ahmeds suitcase was stolen while travelling on the Bagh Express. As if that was not enough, the players had to be without meals during the journey. The IFA did accord a reception to them after their arrival, but it hardly assuaged the grief they had suffered during the journey. We will talk to IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly and tell him everything in detail, a source in the team said. The source added that there were no incentives announced for the boys nor was there any word of appreciation from the officials sitting here. We got a phone call, that too from Utpalda a day after advancing to the final, he added. The two coaches Swarup Das and Nasir Ahmed (goalkeeper), it has been learnt, have already informed IFA secretary about the plight of their journey. It is up to the secretary to decide on the issue, Swarup said. Ahmeds suitcase contained goods worth Rs 10000, including clothes, a camera and other things. He is very upset, the source added. For the likes of Sajal Das, Suprovan Dhar, Shibha Mullik and Ahmed, this was altogether a new experience. But besides such setbacks, they looked enthused by the success and wanted to keep the momentum going. My goal in life is to don the red-and-gold colours one day, Suprovan said at the Howrah Station. Suprovan, who scored two goals in the final against Uttar Pradesh, felt that the match against Chandigarh was the toughest. Otherwise we had had a easy run, he said. Ahmed was also happy with the teams performance. Full credit to the boys who, despite being newcomers, nicely adapted to the conditions, he maintained.

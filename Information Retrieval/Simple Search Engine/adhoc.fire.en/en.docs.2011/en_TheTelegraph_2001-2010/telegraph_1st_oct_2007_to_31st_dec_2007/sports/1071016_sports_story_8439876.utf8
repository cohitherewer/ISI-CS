 Kapur ends tied 18th
Madrid: Shiv Kapur overcame his putting woes and turned in a final round of one-under 71 to finish a commendable tied 18th in the Open de Madrid Valle Romano here. Kapur, who has been groping for the touch that brought him the Asian Tours Rookie of the Year award in 2005, would be happy with his show that also left him richer by euros 10836. The Delhi golfer, after rounds of 72, 70, 69 and 71, totalled six-under 282 to share 18th spot with, among others, Ryder Cup star Thomas Bjorn of Denmark. Tied 20th overnight, Kapur had a sedate start to his round as he parred the first three holes before sinking in back-to-back birdies. The dropped shot on the par-three seventh halted his progress but he still took the turn at one-under. Denmarks Mads Vibe-Hastrup (67) lifted the title. (PTI)

 Madugalle still learning

A STAFF REPORTER
Calcutta: Ranjan Madugalle, who on Saturday became ICCs first Match Referee to complete a century of Tests, said the pace of cricket has improved tremendously and so have the skill levels. 
The 48-year-old who is officiating in the third and final Test between India and Pakistan in Bangalore, in an ICC release, said: Fitness and fielding are the two main aspects that have improved significantly over the last 20 years or so. 
Even in my role as a referee, I watch it as a cricketer trying to learn as much as I can, marvel the skills of the players and see the plots and sub-plots develop in the game. And the best part is that I dont have to pay anything for it. 
A modest Madugalle said he prepared for the Bangalore Test as it was just another match. Records dont mean much to me. It is just another match for me and I prepared myself to carry out the role as it was my first Test, he said. 
As a player Madugalle represented Sri Lanka in 21 Tests and 65 ODIs between 1979 and 1989. He was captain from 1987 to 1989 and served two spells as a national selector in his home country. 
He was appointed to the ICC Match Referees Panel in 1994 and became the first person to hold the position of Chief Match Referee in 2001, a post he still occupies.

 Two-match ban for Dida
Berne: AC Milan goalkeeper Dida has been given a two-match ban by the Uefa following his dramatic fall during the Italian sides 2-1 Champions League defeat against Celtic in Glasgow last week. Dida went down after a Celtic supporter ran onto the pitch in the final stages of the match and appeared to make light contact with the Brazilian. The Uefas disciplinary committee said it had fined Celtic US$57,000  half of which will be suspended for a two-year probationary period  for failing to keep the fan off the pitch. AC Milan announces that it intends to appeal to the Uefa Appeals Commission against the two-game ban inflicted on Nelson Dida, the statement said.  (REUTERS)

 McClaren: Becks eager to prove critics wrong 
 Beckham Manchester: England coach Steve McClaren has tried to dispel rumours that David Beckham is unhappy in the United States, maintaining the Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder is eager to prove his American critics wrong next season. I read a couple of things about him over there not enjoying the life and not enjoying the experience, said McClaren, who dashed over to California last weekend to assess the 32-year-old Beckhams fitness and motivation ahead of a crucial European Championship qualifier. I couldnt find that further from the truth. He loves it over there, hes settled there, his kids are in great schools and hes got a great lifestyle. Beckhams arrival in California was trumpeted with massive fanfare and hype, but many fans quickly became disillusioned when the English star sat out much of the season with a bad ankle and sprained knee. He played just five league games, scoring one goal on a trademark free-kick. Hes got a lot to prove over there and in fact he was disappointed being injured in his first season so hes looking forward, McClaren said. Beckham and Spice Girl wife Victoria might be mixing with Hollywood stars like Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, but McClaren said it didnt seem like his player is engulfed by the celebrity culture. No, because hes got a quieter lifestyle ... over there now to what he had before (in Europe), McClaren said. McClaren himself is facing a barrage of criticism in the British press and could be jobless if England fail to qualify for next summers Euro 2008 tournament. Hes hoping Beckhams experience can help the team get a win against Croatia in their last qualifier at Wembley on November 21  although even that may not be enough if other results dont go Englands way. Beckhams inclusion in the squad  despite still lacking match fitness  continues a recent comeback to international play for the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star. One of the first things McClaren did when succeeding Sven-Goran Eriksson after the 2006 World Cup was to drop Beckham, who captained England in three major tournaments, believing fresh blood should be allowed to prosper. It was a hard decision, but I thought it was for the benefit of the team, McClaren recalled. I felt players could come in and take over that mantle on the right hand side. I didnt find that was the case. With new talent struggling, Beckham was recalled in May to revive the qualification campaign. He played a decisive role in Estonia, as well as featuring in friendlies against Brazil and Germany before his injuries kept him out of four matches in September and October. The impact that he made in the summer, he has failed to capitalise on that. So he is itching to prove these injuries are out, McClaren said. He knows he needs to be fitter. Frustrated by the paucity of talented youngsters at his disposal, McClaren has also been drawing inspiration from New Zealands rugby union team.  (AP)

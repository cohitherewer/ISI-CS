 Former BCB chief in jail 
	Dhaka: The former president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) was sentenced to 13 years in jail by a Dhaka court on Sunday on corruption charges, a state prosecutor said. 
	 ldquo;Ali Asghar will have to serve 10 years in jail for (illegally) amassing wealth, and another three years for concealing the information in his wealth statement to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), rdquo; the prosecutor told reporters. 
	 ldquo;The jail terms will commence one after another, rdquo; he added. 
	 The court also ordered Asghar, a former lawmaker of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by ex-prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, pay a fine of one million ($14,500) Taka, or serve another six months in jail. 
	 The court also ordered Asghar rsquo;s wife, Khusnud Asghar, to serve three years in jail for abetting her husband in corruption. Smith pulls up Shoaib 
	Karachi: South Africa captain Graeme Smith said Pakistan rsquo;s controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar was a match winner but also had been a disruptive influence on the team. 
	 ldquo;Certainly he is a player who has won Test matches for them as a bowler, but certainly we have seen he has been a disruptive influence for them, rdquo; Smith said, replying to a query about how Shoaib rsquo;s absence was influencing their ongoing Test series against pakistan. 
	 Smith, however, made it clear ldquo;my focus is on what we have to do best to win matches. rdquo;
 Shoaib is currently facing a disciplinary hearing after being sent back home from South Africa last month before the ICC World Twenty20 after having a brawl with teammate Mohammed Asif. Atapattu set to join ICL 
	Colombo: After rejecting a place in the Australia-bound national team, former Sri Lankan captain Marvan Atapattu is believed to be considering playing for the breakaway Indian Cricket League (ICL). 
	 ldquo;There are indications that he has a link with the Indian rebel league, rdquo; said Sri Lankan Cricket selection committee chief Ashantha De Mel. The 36-year old batsman has apparently been at odds with the selectors since he was not included in the squad for the World Cup in the West Indies. Later he withdrew from the three match home Test series against Bangladesh. 
	 ldquo;With regard to Marvan, our decision not to play him at the World Cup seems to have upset him, rdquo; De Mel was quoted as saying by a Colombo-based daily.

 Hope to carry on: Butt
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Star Pakistan batsman Younis Khan on Friday promised to deliver against India. Speaking during a promotional event, the 30-year-old pointed out that he has a penchant for scoring well against India. You must have noticed how I return to form whenever I go through a lean patch. Moreover, scoring against India is always a pleasure. Asked to comment on the upcoming India-Pakistan series, Younis said: We know each others strong and weak points. It is going to be a highly interesting series. Younis felt there was no need to target any particular bowler in Indian team during the series. We havent planned to target a particular individual like Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth or Pathan.We will try to score runs against all of them. Seven players  Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf, Farhat Alam, Abdul Rehman, Salman Butt and Imran Nazir  were present during the function but most of them chose not to speak. We will be here in India for quite some time now. You will have a lot of time to speak to us, said a smiling Yousuf. To get an opportunity to come to India, Imran Nazir said, was a great feeling. I consider myself fortunate to play in a series like this. Its a great privilege to be a part of India-Pakistan series. Salman Butt, who played a scintillating innings against Delhi earlier in the day in the warm up tie, said he was lucky to have a good beginning. By the grace of God, I played a good knock. But it is only the beginning. I hope to carry on the same form for the rest of the tour.

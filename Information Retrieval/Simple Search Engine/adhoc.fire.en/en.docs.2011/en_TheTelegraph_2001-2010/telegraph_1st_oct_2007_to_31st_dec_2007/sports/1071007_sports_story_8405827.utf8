 Jekyll Ryan turns Hyde on field
RICHARD HOBSONDambulla: Fortunately for holiday-makers sharing the England team hotel, Ryan Sidebottom is a different animal off the field. Otherwise tourists may find themselves pierced by glares from behind in the buffet queue or barracked for taking the last reclining chair by the pool. There is an illness in cricket known as white-line fever, defined as the change in personality from Jekyll to Hyde on the field. Glenn McGrath and Anil Kumble have been chronic sufferers and Sreesanth would seem to be incurable. Sidebottom, too, presents an easy diagnosis. Think of him as part Basil Fawlty, part Monty Panesar. At one point in the win against Sri Lanka on Thursday, with fists clenched, knees bent and red-faced, he resembled the hotel owner about to thrash his broken-down car. Then, when Sanath Jayasuriya became his second wicket, Sidebottom circled away in an aimless, screaming sprint like the nations favourite patka-wearer but without the missed high fives. The nature of good left-arm swing bowling means that batsmen will play and miss, but time has not mellowed the 29-year-old Sidebottom. As he has aged and improved he is creating more chances, which leads to more bad luck (as he sees it) and more blood starting to boil. Unlike Sreesanth, though, his performance survives the occasional eruption. It is a gee-up for myself, he said. It shows the opposition they are in a bit of a fight and we are out here to win. If I bowl a bad ball then I suppose that release helps me get on track again. Away from cricket I am actually quite laid-back  quiet, really. I dont say much at all. Having missed the whole of the one-day series against India owing to a side strain, Sidebottom may have thought that James Anderson and Stuart Broad would resume their new-ball partnership here. But a combination of experience, especially in the closing overs, and variation fully explain the recall. Broad himself was named in a party of 16 for the England Performance Programme which involves six weeks in Loughborough and in India before Christmas. Players will be on standby for the Test matches in Sri Lanka and are still in contention for the senior squad. Sidebottom has outgrown that tier. With a central contract in his back pocket, he is a key player in all formats. Its little wonder that he should speak so highly of the regime of Peter Moores as head coach. We have a good team spirit here, Sidebottom said. A lot of guys are enjoying their cricket.  THE TIMES, LONDON

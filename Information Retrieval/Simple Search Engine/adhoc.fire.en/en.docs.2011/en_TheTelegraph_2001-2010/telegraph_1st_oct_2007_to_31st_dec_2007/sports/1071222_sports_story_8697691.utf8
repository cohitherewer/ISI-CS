 Bagan look to end Goa trip with a win

Margao: Mohun Bagan will look to end their Goa trip on a winning note when they come up against Salgaocar in a seventh round ONGC I-League match at the Nehru Stadium on Saturday. 
Carlos Roberto Pereiras side have so far managed a 0-2 loss against champions Dempo and a 2-2 result with Churchill Brothers in Goa. 
The Brazilian coach, who has been feeling the heat ever since his team lost two of their first three matches at home, will return to Calcutta a delighted man if his players can pick up three points on Saturday and take their tally to eight. 
The boys are playing well as a team. The only thing now is that they should convert the chances that come their way, said Pereira. 
Mohun Bagan will be missing N. Mohanraj, who was shown the red card in the last game. 
Salgaocar, who earned promotion to the elite division this season, are in a worse situation. 
Perched at the bottom with Sporting Clube de Goa, Salgaocar will be looking for their maiden victory. The former champions have managed just three points.

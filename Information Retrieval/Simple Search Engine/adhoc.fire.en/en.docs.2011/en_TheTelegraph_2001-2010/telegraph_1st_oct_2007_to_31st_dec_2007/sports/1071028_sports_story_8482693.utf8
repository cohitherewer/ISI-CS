 Jyoti stays tied 13th 
Mallorca: Jyoti Randhawa carded a one-under 69 in the second round of the Mallorca Classic on Friday to remain at tied 13th. Randhawa is now three-under 137 .  Robert-Jan Derksen of The Netherlands and Frances Jean-Francois Lucquin share the lead. Both shot five-under 65s for a nine-under total of 131. The pair are three shots ahead of Denmarks Mads Vibe-Hastrup and Irelands Peter Lawrie. In Miami, meanwhile, Arjun Atwal will have to wait to know if he will make the cut at the $575,000 Miccosukee Championship on the Nationwide Tour after heavy rain led to the suspension of play on Friday.

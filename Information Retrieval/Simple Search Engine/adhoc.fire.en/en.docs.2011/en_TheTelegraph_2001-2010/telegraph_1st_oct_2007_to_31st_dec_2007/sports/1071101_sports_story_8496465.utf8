 Jeev returns to defend title
Sotogrande (Spain): Jeev Milkha Singh returns to the Volvo Masters of Europe on Thursday to defend his title. With the continents top players  including eight former champions  jostling for glory, a decent finish in the 20th edition of the tournament would be a reasonable target for Jeev Milkha Singh. Jeev had a fairytale season last year, which yielded four titles and the icing on the cake was his one-stroke victory over Luke Donald, Sergio Garcia and Padraig Harrington here. He would need a miracle of sorts to repeat the feat but a top 10 finish should be good enough for Jeev, who will be joined by compatriot Jyoti Randhawa. Jeev has been paired with Valderrama rookie Fredrik Andersson-Hed of Sweden, while Randhawa will have British Ryder Cup star Donald for company. The event is expected to live up to its billing as a magnificent finale to the European season. (PTI)

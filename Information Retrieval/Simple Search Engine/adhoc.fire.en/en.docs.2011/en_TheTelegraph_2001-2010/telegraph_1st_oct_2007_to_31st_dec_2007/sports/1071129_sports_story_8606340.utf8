 Jose Mourinho to FA: Come and get me 
TIM RICH  Jose Mourinho Jose Mourinho has stated he would be interested in succeeding Steve McClaren as England manager. The most charismatic manager of his generation, who won two Premiership titles with Chelsea and the Champions League with Porto, on Tuesday night told the Football Association to come and get me. You will have to speak to the FA to see if they would be interested in offering me the job, he said on Tuesday. I cant say what I think until they are interested. Tell the FA to come and get me. We will have to wait and see but I rule nothing out. While candidates such as Martin Neill, Sam Allardyce and Alan Curbishley have ruled themselves out of the race, Mourinho ridiculed suggestions that the post of England manager was an impossible job, saying: There is no such thing as an impossible job in football. Mourinho, who since his sacking by Chelsea in September had been expected to wait for an offer from a leading club in Italy or Spain, would be an expensive but popular choice. He fulfils nearly all the requirements. He has been hugely successful, he has charisma, speaks English fluently and knows the domestic game. Also, Mourinho would have no problem facing down the wilder excesses of the English media. Should the FA want a less controversial figure at the helm, Guus Hiddink, who withdrew his candidacy to succeed Sven-Goran Eriksson last year, is yet to sign a promised contract extension with the Russian FA that would take him beyond the 2010 World Cup.

 Renault to ask Alonso to tie knot again
KEVIN GARSIDE Alonso Renault team principal Flavio Briatore is just days away from taking Fernando Alonso to be his lawful wedded driver for a second time. The colourful Italian opted for a matrimonial analogy to explain the status of the contract talks taking place between them. When you marry, split up and get back together, it is not easy, B riatore said. This week will be decisive for this marriage. He can choose and he knows us. Last year he chose McLaren and made a mistake. We often forget these are 25-year-olds who have never lived their youths. Theyd prefer to stay at home with their auntie rather than to go doing promotional work in Bangladesh. Alonso knows us from a human point of view and that is important. At McLaren he arrived as the world champion and he was put in competition against a rookie driver: that way the relationship inside a team is put in danger. You cant have two prima donnas inside a team. In this phase he is not thinking of the money. Should Alonso accept the proposal, the arrangement spells doom for his teammate, who will also be new to the team if Briatore is to be believed. Renault will definitely have different drivers next year. There is a 60 per cent chance Alonso will be with us, he said. Either way it appears Giancarlo Fisichella is on his way out of Formula One and Heikki Kovaleinen to a new team, probably McLaren if Williams refuse to release Nico Rosberg. Briatore has clearly assured Alonso that Renault will not suffer the same fate as McLaren in the espionage case against them. It must be hoped that the defence being drawn up by Renaults legal team to answer charges of possessing unauthorised technical information belonging to McLaren is more compelling than Briatores. When we discovered everything, we informed McLaren and the FIA (Formula Ones regulatory body). We found out who had brought these disks. When you have a thousand employees it is difficult to notice what is happening, Briatore said. The information at issue was allegedly contained on 10 floppy disks and introduced to Renault by a former McLaren engineer. The World Council in Monaco will hear the case on December 5 and a judgement will be handed down the same day.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

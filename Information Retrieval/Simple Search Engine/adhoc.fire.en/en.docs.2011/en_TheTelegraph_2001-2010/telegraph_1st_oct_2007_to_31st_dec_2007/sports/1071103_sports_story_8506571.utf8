 Rahul Dravid the cynosure as Karnataka face Mumbai
 Mumbai captain Amol Muzumdar during a practice session with Rahul Dravid in Mumbai on Friday Mumbai: Rahul Dravid gets a chance to rediscover his golden touch with the bat when he turns out for Karnataka in their opening Elite Division group A Ranji Trophy tie against holders Mumbai starting here Saturday. The former India skipper, omitted from the first two ODIs of five-match series against Pakistan, will play under another stalwart Anil Kumble. The first-class game at the Wankhede is the ideal stage for Dravid, who had a lean time in the seven-match ODI series against Australia, to get among the runs ahead of the season. The last time Dravid had turned out for Karnataka in Ranji Trophy was in Rajkot for last seasons league clash against Saurashtra. Also keen to get into the groove for the Test series against Pakistan would be Kumble, playing his first Ranji tie for Karnataka in two seasons since returning home from England in August. The ace leg-spinner has turned out for the All Star team in the sixes event in Hong Kong, but had played little else since Indias last Test rubber. Newly appointed Karnataka coach and ex-ODI player Vijay Bharadwaj on Friday said the presence of the star duo would certainly be a big plus for his team against an opposition like Mumbai. The youngsters in the team can learn a lot by sharing the dressing room with Rahul and Anil whose perseverance is to be appreciated. They are still going strong after such a long career, the Level III coach said. Recalling Karnatakas surge into the semi-finals last season with a young team, Kumble said it was important for the team to get a winning start to their campaign. Gujarat  after being relegated to the Plate Division  will look to claim their spot in the Elite Division when they open their season against Assam on Saturday at the Sardar Patel Stadium at Motera. Gujarat bowling will be bolstered by the return of medium-pacer Siddharth Trivedi who had missed out the entire season last year due to a lower back injury.  (PTI)

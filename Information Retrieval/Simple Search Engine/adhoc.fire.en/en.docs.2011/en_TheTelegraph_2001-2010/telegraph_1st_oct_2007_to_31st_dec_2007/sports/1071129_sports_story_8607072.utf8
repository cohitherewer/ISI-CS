 Hameed: Give Malik time 
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Yasir Hameed is confident that Shoaib Malik will prove his mettle as Pakistan captain if the selectors show some patience. He (Malik) is a good thinker and a good listener He is very energetic on the field and popular with his teammates, the Pakistan opener told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. What Malik lacks is experience. If he is given some time, Im sure he will prove himself, said the 29-year old from Peshawar. Asked how Maliks style of leadership differed from Inzamam-ul Haqs, Hameed said it was the experience factor. Inzybhai was an experienced campaigner. He played for the country for about 15 years. He was like a big brother and always guided us in crucial matches, Hameed said. Shoaib is a nice captain who will get better with experience We should rely on him. On his own goals, Hameed said he was focused on getting runs consistently and cementing his place in the XI. The only thing Ive got to do is stay focused and score runs which will help me be a regular member of the team, Hameed said. Hameed, who made his Test debut against Bangladesh in 2003, scored 29 and 36 in the Kotla Test which India won by six wickets on Monday. Hameed, who should be playing his 22nd Test on Friday, missed out on a big score in the first Test and was determined to make amends at the Eden. It was one of my dreams to play a Test at the Eden Hopefully it will come true and Ill play a good three-figure knock, said Hameed, before setting off for a hair cut.

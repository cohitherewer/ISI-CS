 Paes, Damm set to part ways
AMITAVA DAS GUPTACalcutta: Leander Paes and Martin Damm have decided to end their two-year association at the end of this season. The Indian will team up with Australian Paul Hanley in 2008, while Damms new partner will be fellow Czech Pavel Vizner. We have different goals next year Martin wants to cut down on his tennis, while I want to play a full year, so we decided to get new partners, Paes told The Telegraph from Vienna where he and Damm have reached the last four. We respect each other a lot and are very good friends It will remain like that even when we are not sharing the same court, said Paes. Paes and Damm had a very good first year, reaching the Australian Open final and winning the US Open besides triumphing in sHertogenbosch. This season, they have won the Indian Wells Masters and the Rotterdam crown so far, but had a wretched run in three of the four Grand Slams. The Wimbledon quarter final appearance apart, Paes and Damm managed a third round in the Australian Open, second round in the French and, as the defending US Open champions, tripped at the very first hurdle at Flushing Meadows. Paes and Damm are, however, within striking distance of sealing a berth in the Masters Cup again. They are currently No. 4 in the ATP Doubles Race with 542 points. The top eight pairs will qualify for the prestigious season-ending event in Shanghai. We are almost there the goal now is to have a good four weeks going into Shanghai try to win as many matches as possible, said Paes. The ongoing Vienna tournament is Paes and Damms first since the disappointing US Open. They will next play the Madrid Masters, Basel and the Paris Masters in the build-up to the Shanghai Masters Cup Doubles. Winning the Masters Cup would be a fitting finale for us Neither Martin nor I have won it before, so we are really looking forward to Shanghai, said Paes. The Indian, by the way, has been on the losing side of the Masters final four times  thrice with Mahesh Bhupathi and once with Nenad Zimonjic.

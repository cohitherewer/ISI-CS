 ZC request to PCB
Karachi: Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) has requested the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to arrange a few first-class matches when they tour Pakistan for a one-day series early next year. Zimbabwe and the International Cricket Council (ICC) came to an agreement in 2005 that the African nation wont play Tests until their domestic system is revived and some good players come to the fore following a mass exodus by leading players. A PCB official said Zimbabwe are due to play five one-day Internationals in Pakistan in January next year but have also asked the PCB to arrange some first class matches. They want to come around January 6 and play a few side games in Karachi before the start of the official one-day series. They want to give their younger players more exposure, the official said. The PCB has decided to schedule some of the ODIs versus Zimbabwe in lesser-known venues where international matches have not been played for a number of years. According to the itinerary, the one-day games are scheduled in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sialkot, Faisalabad and Sheikhupura. A PCB official said the smaller centres were being given games as part of a rotation policy to allow every association to host an international team.  (PTI)

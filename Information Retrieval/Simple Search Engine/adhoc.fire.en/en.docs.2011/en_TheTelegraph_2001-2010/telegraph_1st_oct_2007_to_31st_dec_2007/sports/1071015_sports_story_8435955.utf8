 Germany first to grab Euro berth
- Henry equals Platini rsquo;s record of 41 goals for France
 Italys Andrea Pirlo celebrates his goal against Georgia with teammate Fabio Grosso in Genoa on Saturday. (AP) London: Germany became the first country to win a place at Euro 2008 with a 0-0 draw in Ireland on Saturday, while World Cup finalists Italy and France still live in fear of losing out to Scotland. The draw left Germany three points clear of Czech Republic in group D and eight ahead of third-placed Ireland, who have two games left and are very unlikely to qualify. Coach Joachim Loew told a German television: Were all delighted... now weve qualified for the Euro finals. Hats off to the team. Germanys feat is unique as most groups have three or even four teams fighting for two places at next years finals in Austria and Switzerland. However, the Czechs, Romania, who beat the highly fancied Netherlands 1-0, Croatia, Spain and Sweden all look very good bets for a tournament ticket. Nowhere is the battle more enthralling than group B, where the Scots remain surprise leaders on 24 points after a convincing 3-1 victory over Ukraine at Hampden. Goals from Kenny Miller and Lee McCulloch had Scotland 2-0 up after 10 minutes and James McFadden struck in the second half to allay any fears raised by Andriy Shevchenkos 24th minute riposte from the visitors. World champions Italy are second on 23 points after beating Georgia 2-0 in Genoa, with France just a point behind after their 6-0 rout of the Faroe Islands. Italy, whose hopes are likely to turn on their crunch game away to Scotland on November 17, had goals from Andrea Pirlo and Fabio Grosso to thank for their win. A strike by Thierry Henry in the Faroes equalled Michel Platinis record of 41 goals for France as Les Bleus made light of a tortuous journey to the islands which ended only hours before kick off. There was no doubting the verdict of Romania coach Victor Piturca after his teams home victory over the Dutch: It is a huge step towards qualifying for next years finals. (Reuters)

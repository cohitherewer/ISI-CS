 Regent Appeal may come good 
 STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Regent Appeal is fancied to lift the 1,400m Unknown Warrior Cup, the prime attraction in Wednesdays poorly represented seven-event race card. The Colts Trial Stakes run of the Daniel David-trained colt needs to be ignored. The earlier runs of the Eljohar-Tamure colt points to his winning chances. More importantly, Regent Appeal has been maintaining his good form and may score in the hands of jockey Imran Chisty.

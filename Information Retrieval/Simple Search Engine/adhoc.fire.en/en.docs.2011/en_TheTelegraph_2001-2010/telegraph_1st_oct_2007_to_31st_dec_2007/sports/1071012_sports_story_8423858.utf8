 Saturday tryst for Holyfield
 Holyfield will take on Ibragimov for his fifth world title Moscow: The story of Evander Holyfields career can be told by its numbers. Nicknamed The Real Deal, Holyfield is the only four-time heavyweight world champion and has fought 22 title bouts in 20 years since moving up as undisputed cruiserweight champ. Hes beaten Mike Tyson twice, and counts George Foreman and Larry Holmes among other wins. But when Holyfield bids for a fifth world title by challenging unbeaten WBO champion Sultan Ibragimov on Saturday, it will be only six days before his 45th birthday  a number that has many wondering if he should even be allowed in the Khodynka Arena ring. After losing a unanimous points decision to journeyman Larry Donald at Madison Square Garden in 2004 for his third straight defeat, Holyfied was banned from fighting again in New York on the grounds of diminished skills. But following a two-year break, he went to Texas and got four straight wins, albeit over modest opposition, to earn another title shot when WBA champion Ruslan Chagaev withdrew because of injury. Holyfield could become the second-oldest man to win a heavyweight title, behind Foreman after he beat Michael Moorer for the WBA belt in 1994 at 45, and he is adamant that he deserves a chance to not only beat the 32-year-old Ibragimov but also unify the various titles. It should not be based on age, Holyfield said on Wednesday. If you pass a physical and can protect yourself, why not? I dont believe in superstition and numbers and all that. I believe that I can win on any given day, at any given time. I dont believe in losing. I think the only way you can lose is if you quit. Im not a quitter and wont lose. My goal is to be the undisputed heavyweight champ of the world. (AP)

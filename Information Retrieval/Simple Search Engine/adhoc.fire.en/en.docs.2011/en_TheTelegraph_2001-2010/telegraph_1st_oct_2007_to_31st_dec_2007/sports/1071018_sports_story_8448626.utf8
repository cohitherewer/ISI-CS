 Symonds abused at the Wankhede
SPORTSDESK AMP; AGENCIESA section of the Wankhede turned abusive when Andrew Symonds came out to bat on Wednesday afternoon. The section in question, at the far end, also made monkey-like faces and noises. That Symonds failed to score only encouraged that section to have a go at him even more. Apparently, that got caught on camera and the police were asked to identify and evict the culprits. The Australians find such behaviour racist and, shortly after the latest incident, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Cricket Australia (CA) issued a joint statement. Cricket crowds in all cricket nations are often noisy and boisterous, which is part of the fun of cricket, BCCI president Sharad Pawar and CA chairman Creagh Connor said in a joint statement. But all cricket nations have to be on guard to ensure that the fun does not cross the boundary into unacceptable behaviour. If it does, it is our expectation that the specifics of ICC anti-racism code be enforced without fear or favour. Talking about the crowd at the post-match press conference, Ricky Ponting said: The reception we received here was a lot different from the reception at other venues Some of the things which happened today would be totally unacceptable anywhere I understand a couple of people were arrested and take out of the stadium. The joint statement added: Players of all countries have a right to expect they will be treated with respect wherever they play in the world, the statement said. Spectators, team officials or players who are concerned about inappropriate behaviour of other people at venues should draw the attention of venue authorities immediately so that it can be assessed on the spot and, if appropriate, addressed immediately rather than being reviewed via media reports published well after the crowd has gone home.

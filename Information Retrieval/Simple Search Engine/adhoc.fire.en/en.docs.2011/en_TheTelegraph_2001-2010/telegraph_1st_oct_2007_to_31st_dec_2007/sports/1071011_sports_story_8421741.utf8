 I take it one match at a time: Sachin
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTVadodara: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar didnt do any homework before putting the Big Three  Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid  on notice the other day. On Wednesday afternoon, a lady from the media didnt get her facts right either. What do you have to say about more lows than highs in the past year? she asked Sachin Tendulkar during his brief interaction with the media. Bewildered, the senior-most pro replied with a touch of irritation: You should see the scores... It seems youve been following some other game. Point made. Indeed, if Sachins ODI performances in 2007 are to be focused on, then he averaged 63.67 against the West Indies, 27.50 versus Sri Lanka, 32.00 in the World Cup, 51.00 in Ireland (against Ireland and South Africa), 53.43 versus England in England and is averaging 34.50 in the ongoing series against Australia. The following are excerpts from Sachins interaction  incidentally, some of the questions were dealt with by him during his exclusive chat with The Telegraph on Tuesday evening: On being less than a day away from his 400th ODI appearance Accha mehsoos ho raha hai... Mera approach normal rahega... On the special moments in his one-day career (Smiles) Quite a few, but the really special ones are three  when I bowled the last over in the 1993 Hero Cup semi-finals versus South Africa, the way I batted in the (April) 1998 tournament in Sharjah and the 98 against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup. On the landmark coming versus world champions Australia Its a coincidence... It has worked out that way, but the 400th match could have been against any opposition. No special feelings or emotions. On whether he will continue till he reaches the 500 mark I take it one match at a time... Today, Im just looking forward to tomorrow... Thats the way it has always been with me. On having scored three of his 41 hundreds at the venue (Reliance Stadium, formerly the IPCL Stadium) That Ive done well makes me happy... Like all batsmen, I aim to do well and to help the team do well... Getting hundreds isnt as important as ensuring that the team wins... Its not that Im playing for hundreds, Im playing with the aim of helping the team win... Finally, on the ongoing series It has been competitive and, yes, I expect more good cricket. Footnote: Sachin has reached so many milestones that this one is actually going to be a small dot in his illustrious career, is what teammate Murali Kartik had to say.

 Bengal see Yuvraj threat
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Yuvraj Singh, who failed to find a place in the Indian Test team during the ongoing series against Pakistan, was released on Friday to play Ranji Trophy for Punjab, BCCI sources said. Now Yuvraj will be seen in action against Bengal in Siliguri in their four-day Group B Super League match beginning Saturday. With Punjab side boosted by Yuvrajs addition, Bengal will be under pressure to do well after losing to Baroda in their last match. Bengal are expected to play three seamers  Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul and Ashok Dinda  against Yuvraj Singh and Co. The home team is likely to bring in another change with Priyankar Mukherjee replacing out-of-form off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri. Its going to be a tough time for Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who has been passing through a lean patch having just managed one run with two noughts from three innings.

 Malik: Our fielding let us down
OUR CORRESPONDENT 		Shoaib MalikGuwahati: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik did not blame his teams five-wicket loss to India at the Nehru Stadium on Monday to their bowling or batting. According to him it was the fielding lapses that cost them dear. India won the first ODI by five wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.  Two hundred and thirty-nine was defendable on this kind of a surface, a disappointed Malik told reporters at a press conference. Had we taken the chances that came our way, things might have been different. I picked the best possible team but our fielding was not up to par, he said. Gautam Gambhirs successive edges between first slip and the wicketkeeper in one Shoaib Akhtar over were the most glaring lapses. To add insult to injury, they fetched Gambhir two fours. Gambhir was on seven and 11, respectively, when he edged the deliveries between Kamran Akmal and Younis Khan.  Shoaib AkhtarHe went on to make 44 and help steady the Indian innings after Shoaib had dealt the home side a blow by having Sachin Tendulkar out cheaply for four. On top of all the clumsy fielding, a catch was also dropped. It (fielding) is one area we need to improve, Malik said, dismissing suggestions that it was the Indian spin attack  of Harbhajan Singh and Murali Kartik  and the partnership between Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh that did them in. He said that the hard and bumpy outfield compounded their fielding woes. Shoaib, who took two for 52 in eight overs, came in for praise from the captain. He is an asset and is our best option. On top of that he is fit, said Malik. The Pakistan captain is not taking the loss too much to heart. We take every match as a new match. The past has no relevance, he said, adding that with the packed calendar, You get another chance to make amends quickly. When asked about playing in India, he said: It always feels good to play here. There is always a good turnout and the crowd is passionate about the game. He did not entertain any questions on the political situation in Pakistan.

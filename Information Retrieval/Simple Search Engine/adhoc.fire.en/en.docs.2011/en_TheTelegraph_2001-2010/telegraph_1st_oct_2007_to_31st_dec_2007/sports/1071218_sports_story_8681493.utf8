 CRICKET BRIEFS 

 Gilchrist rested for final ODI vs NZ
 Sydney: Adam Gilchist will be rested from Thursdays final Chappell Hadlee Trophy one-dayer against New Zealand to ease his workload ahead of the India Test series, Cricket Australia said on Monday.
 It was always the selection panels intention for Adam to play in the Twenty20 International and the opening two matches of the Chappell Hadlee Trophy regardless of results, Chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement.
 New South Wales keeper Brad Haddin will deputise for Gilchrist in the third and final Chappell Hadlee Trophy game against the Black Caps in Hobart.

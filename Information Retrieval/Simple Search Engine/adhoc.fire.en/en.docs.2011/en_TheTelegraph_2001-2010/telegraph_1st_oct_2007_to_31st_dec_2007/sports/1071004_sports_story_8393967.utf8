 Shoaib needs a psychiatrist: Manager
 Shoaib Akhtar Karachi: Pakistan cricket team manager Talat Ali has recommended counselling for controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar after his latest brawl with teammate Mohammed Asif in South Africa. According to sources, Talat in his report to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and disciplinary committee has recommended that Shoaib needed to be counselled for his attitude and behavioural problems. Talat has even said if necessary he should have a session with a psychiatrist, the source said. Talat also said the paceman be slapped with only a heavy fine and a ban of five international matches. Talat feels that sending him back from South Africa was strong enough punishment and he should now be let off with a five matches ban and a fine, the source said. The disciplinary committee has summoned Shoaib in Lahore on Saturday for a hearing and is due to announce a decision on October 8. On Monday, the PCB charged Shoaib with five counts of indiscipline, including the one involving his brawl with Asif, which may lead to a six-month ban on the mercurial pacer. A PCB official said the five charges also include violating a probation period of six weeks, going to England to play a charity match without boards permission, making accusations against teammate Shahid Afridi and addressing an unauthorised press conference after being sent home from South Africa. Shoaib has to respond to these charges when he appears before the disciplinary committee on Saturday, the official said. He said a fine of Rs 300,000 was now automatic for violating the probation period of six weeks while he could be banned for up to six months if he did not come up with a satisfactory reply before the committee. After being sent back from South Africa before the ICC World Twenty20, Shoaib held a press conference and accused Afridi of instigating the brawl with Asif. He also claimed that he accidentally hit Asif with the bat. Meanwhile, Pakistans former captain and fast bowler Waqar Younis has also said the board should not be too harsh on Shoaib and discouraged any long-term ban on him. If Shoaib is in a mess today the board is to be blamed for this situation. In the past, when it should have taken action against him it didnt. Now this latest offence is no big deal. Such fights have taken place before in the Pakistan dressing room but were never publicised, Waqar said. He said the board should stay with a fine and a ban of few matches but ensure Shoaib is available for the coming tour of India. It is up to the board to ensure discipline in the side but it shouldnt be to harsh with him now, he added.  (PTI)

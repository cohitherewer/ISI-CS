 CRICKET BRIEFS 
						
					 Malinga vows to be fast and furious						
	 Brisbane: Sri Lanka pace spearhead Lasith Malinga has vowed to go hammer and tongs at the Australian batsmen in the two-Test series getting underway here Thursday. Malinga will make his first tour appearance in the three-day match against Queensland at the Allan Border field starting here Friday. The Australians named four fast bowlers in their 13-man Test squad on Thursday, but Malinga believes he can generate more pace than he did on Sri Lanka rsquo;s last tour here in 2004. ldquo;I have more pace now than last time we played here. I think maybe I can hit around 140kmph now mdash; I want more pace, rdquo; Malinga said. ldquo;All fast bowlers are fond of the bouncer. I am the same. We are going to be very attacking. rdquo;					
	 Captain Mahela Jayawardene has promised his side would give as good as the got from Australia his summer.						
	 ldquo;That rsquo;s important hellip; That you don rsquo;t lose your cool. That rsquo;s the seniors rsquo; responsibility to guide the guys through periods in difficult situations, rdquo; Jayawardene said.						
	 Jayawardene warned of a new and improved Malinga for the Australian tour.						
	 ldquo;He rsquo;s learned a lot in the last three years since he has been here, rdquo; he said.
 ldquo;He has learned to adjust to different conditions. Now he rsquo;s got the ability to control his aggression, which is a good thing.						
	 ldquo;Malinga is one of our attacking options, but we don rsquo;t want to put a lot of pressure on the young guys, rdquo; he said.						
	 Book traces bonhomie						
	 Sydney: The Indian subcontinent has transformed from a cricketing afterthought in Australia to a financial powerhouse increasingly important to players and officials Down Under, a history of Cricket Australia (CA) reveals. The book, Inside Story, by Gideon Haigh and David Frith examines the archives of CA, formerly the Australian Cricket Board (ACB), to present a warts-and-all account of the game rsquo;s history.					
	 Until the 1950s, the book says, Australian cricket administrators ldquo;manifested little interest in the cricket world beyond the lsquo;Anglosphere rsquo;, rdquo; mdash; England, New Zealand and apartheid-era South Africa. Relations with India were almost non-existent. However, as a sign of changing times, Australia this year altered their traditional Test schedule to accommodate India rsquo;s visit beginning on December 26.

 Rangers surprise Lyon 3-0
 Inter Milans Zlatan Ibrahimovic after scoring against PSV in Milan on Tuesday Belgrade: Rangers produced the biggest surprise in the Champions League on Tuesday with a 3-0 win at Olympique Lyon that gave them maximum points in group E. Goals from Lee McCulloch, Daniel Cousin and DaMarcus Beasley put Rangers level on six points at the top of the group with Barcelona, who won 2-0 at VfB Stuttgart thanks to second-half goals by Carles Puyol and Lionel Messi. On a bright evening for British clubs, Manchester United edged Roma 1-0 at Old Trafford to put themselves in pole position in group F. Arsenal also edged out Steaua Bucharest 1-0 in Romania to keep top spot in group H. Goals from Tonel and Polga gave Sporting Lisbon a 2-1 win at Dynamo Kiev after their opening home defeat by Manchester United while Sevilla bounced back from a 0-3 rout at Arsenal to record a 4-2 victory over visitors Slavia Prague. In group G, Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored off a penalty and a header in the first half to hand 10-man Inter Milan a 2-0 home win over PSV Eindhoven after Cristian Chivu was sent off in the 65th minute. The result put Inter level with PSV on three points from two matches behind leaders Fenerbahce, who have four points after their 2-2 draw at CSKA Moscow. Three Brazilians scored in the encounter, Alex giving the Turkish champions an early lead and Deivid snatching a late equaliser after Serbian midfielder Milos Krasic and Vagner Love and had turned the match for CSKA, who have one point. There was no such drama in Lyon, where Rangers produced their best Champions League performance of recent times in an emphatic victory over the winners of six successive French league titles. McCullough headed Rangers into a 23rd minute lead, Cousin rifled in the second and Beasley calmly slotted home the third as the Scottish side ended their nine-game winless away streak in the competition dating back to 2000. Second-half goals from Carles Puyol and Lionel Messi gave Barcelona a convincing win. Defender Puyol poked the ball in from a few metres in the 53rd minute after keeper Raphael Schaefer failed to hold a Ronaldinho header. Messi made certain of victory 14 minutes later when he swept the ball in from Thierry Henrys cut-back. (Reuters)

 Kirsten proud to get Team India job
 Gary KirstenDurban: Gary Kirsten said on Saturday that his India job was very much a reality and the deal would be signed and sealed by Monday. They (the BCCI) have given me a week to make a decision, but its pretty much a reality. By Monday, it will be pretty much signed and sealed, he said. I have turned down numerous coaching opportunities due to family reasons in the past but this one is such an esteemed one that I have to take a different look, Kirsten said. Its something I always wanted to do and to be offered such an esteemed job is mind-boggling. Its something I am proud of, he added. Kirsten said only the logistics part of the deal remained to be settled. I am very keen to take up the post. I am just looking at the logistics with my family and how it is going to work out. Negotiations are under way and I would make a final decision by Monday. Kirsten said the job would become effective immediately, but he had obtained an assurance that he could start from March 1 next year as he had a number of commitments in South Africa. I will be moving in and out for the time being and then join the team in Australia, said the South African. He will join the team after the second Test in Sydney. Kirsten said hes already had a very encouraging chat with Test skipper Anil Kumble. He was very encouraged to hear that I could join the team. I am also looking forward to working with Anil and the rest of the team, Kirsten said. The last thing you want to do is come in and be a distraction, but I have spoken to Anil about my situation and he is comfortable with me joining the tour later. Kirsten, who doesnt have the experience of coaching any side, was confident of making a mark. I will not be coming in and imposing my ideas on them. That would be wrong. I will try and blend in and help anyway I can. On the upcoming Test series Down Under, Kirsten predicted India would cash in on Australias lack of a quality spinner. They had Shane Warne there for many years, and he was able to fill a lot of jobs for them, most notably his ability to strike and take wickets in all conditions and situations, Kirsten said. Now there is a possibility that Australia may play an inexperienced spinner, and Im sure the Indian batsmen will look to put pressure on whoever that turns out to be, Kirsten said. If they can do that successfully, it could play into Indias hands. They have got a good record against Australia, and I think the guys are feeling pretty confident heading into the series, he said. Kirsten, however, added that the Aussies could never be underestimated. Im always very wary of an Australian team that seems to have a few holes in it, he said. They have plenty of depth and in a lot of cases have the players to replace those who have left. Someone like (Brad) Hogg is a good example, having played a lot of one-day cricket, and he could do a good job. Still, there seems to be uncertainty there, so you have to look at it. (AGENCIES)

 Akmal gearing up for India tour
 Kamran Akmal Lahore: Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal has been preparing for the tour of India by training on simulated surfaces based on what he expects to face in the Tests and ODIs there. Akmal, under fire for his keeping in recent months, said he had already started preparing for the India tour realising its importance. I went there in 2005 and have a fair idea of the sort of surfaces that could be used in the Tests in particular. I have started training by concentrating on my keeping, especially against spinners, he said. The 25-year-old said he was aware how tough it was to keep on the slow Indian pitches and was mentally and practically preparing himself for the challenge. Pakistan drew the Test series 1-1 the last time they were in India  with Akmal scoring a match-saving hundred in the first Test in Mohali  and won the ODI series 4-2. But he expected the Indian team to give a tougher fight this time. They have some good young players and they have more bowling options which has made them a more consistent side, Akmal said. He said he did not take the pressure of criticism about his wicketkeeping skills. It has been hard for me to ignore calls to replace me. It adds to the pressure, but I am learning to accept these things. Watching the way wicketkeepers like Mark Boucher and Adam Gilchrist perform consistenly over the years is in itself a big motivation for me. I look at Boucher and Gilchrist, and know I can take the pressure and also play for a long time, Akmal said.  I tell myself that if Boucher and Gilchrist can last for so long having battled through bad form or fitness problems, I can also do the same. Pakistan paid a heavy price in the first Test against South Africa in Karachi when Akmal dropped Jacques Kallis on 51 and he went on to score a match-winning 155. The wicketkeeper, who has played 28 successive Tests and 57 one-day Internationals since late 2004, scored three consecutive half-centuries as an opener in the two Tests against the Proteas to redeem his reputation.

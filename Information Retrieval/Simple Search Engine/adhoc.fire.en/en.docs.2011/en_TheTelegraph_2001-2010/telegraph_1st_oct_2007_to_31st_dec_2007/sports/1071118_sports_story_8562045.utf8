 Yusuf, Rakesh run amok
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Yusuf Pathan continued to wreak havoc on Bengal for the second consecutive day  this time with the willow  in the Ranji Trophy Super League match in Vadodara on Saturday. Having taken five wickets to contribute to Bengals downfall (from 262 for three to 370 all out) in the first innings, the senior Pathan blasted 183 off 150 balls to put Baroda on top, according to information received here. While Pathan was in hurry to score his maiden century, his teammate Rakesh Solanki was a bit sedate. He hit a brilliant 186 off 335 balls. The southpaw, who was unbeaten on 43 at stumps on day II, added 276 with Yusuf for the sixth wicket. Baroda folded up for 515, thus grabbing a lead of 145 . At the end of the days play, Bengal were one for one. But the new Bengal skipper, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, was not awed. Well put all our efforts together one point is what were looking for, Shukla told The Telegraph from Vadodara. Shukla however blamed it on the Lodhgars absence. Having sustained a back injury, the left-arm spinner could only bowl six overs before he left the ground. He will at least take a week to recover, Shukla revealed. How much more could (Sourasish) Lahiri (the only full-time spinner) could have done.

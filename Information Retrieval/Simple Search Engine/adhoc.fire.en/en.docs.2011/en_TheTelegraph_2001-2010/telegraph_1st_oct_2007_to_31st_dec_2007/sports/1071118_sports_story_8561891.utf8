 Kapur up to tied third
Hong Kong: A blemish-free five-under 65 propelled Shiv Kapur to tied third spot, while Indian-born Swede Daniel Chopra was equally impressive, carding a 66 to share the seventh position after the penultimate round of the $2.25 million Hong Kong Open here Saturday. Kapur now has a total of 11-under 199 with Chopra a shot adrift at the par-70 Hong Kong Golf Club. Four of Kapurs five birdies came in the front nine and he ended the day just five strokes behind leader Robert Karlsson of Sweden, who fired a four-under 66. The Delhi-golfer credited his caddies reading of the course and his improved putting for the brilliant day. Ive putted better today as I have been struggling with my putting the last couple of weeks. Ive been hitting good shots but my putting has let me down. However, the last two days have been great, Kapur, currently ranked 15th on the Asian Tours Order of Merit, said. I think my caddie has done a great job reading the greens. He has been with me for 15 years now and I brought him all the way from India, he added. Chopra was also impressive, striking six birdies against a couple of bogeys. Among other Indians in the fray, SSP Chowrasia was tied for the 39th spot after returning an even-par 70. A couple of shots behind Chowrasia was Rahil Gangjee at tied 51st position. Gangjee returned a card of 69.  (PTI)

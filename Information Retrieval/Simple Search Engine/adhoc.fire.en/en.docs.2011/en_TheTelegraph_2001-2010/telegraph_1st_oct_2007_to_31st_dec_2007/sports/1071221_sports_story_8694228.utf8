 Age is just a number: Narain

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
 Narain in New Delhi on Thursday 
New Delhi: Ace driver Narain Karthikeyan is still hopeful of making a Formula One comeback in near future. 
Speaking to the media on his triumphant return from China where he led Team India to top honours in the A1 GP race, Karthikeyan said he still has a few options to get back to the top tier of motor sport. 
Leaving Team Williams was not the end of the world, Indias lone F1 driver said. I was a test driver with them and I left because they didnt offer me the position of the third driver. It is something my management staff didnt like. But there could be so many options in the near future. 
Karthikeyan, 31, refused to accept the suggestion that it may be difficult for him to make a comeback at this age. 
Age is just a number, he said. If I remember well, Damon Kill made his F1 debut at my age and went on to win the world championships. These things hardly matter. If I win races, no one would talk about my age. 
The Coimbatore-based Karthikeyan said he would be concentrating on the A1 GP at the moment. 
People do notice you when you win. I am on a high after winning in China. In F1 circuit, you do everything for your individual success. Here, it is a great feeling to achieve something for the nation. 
The ace driver said his aim was to lead Team India to a top six finish every time in the A1 GP. Next season we are going to drive Ferrari cars. That would certainly boost our chances.

 Lewis Hamilton has the drive
Kevin Garside Hamilton Room 1422 of the Sao Paulo Hilton was indeed a scene of desolation the morning after the day before. The boy who might have been king sat in a T-shirt and shorts. The brightness had gone from the eyes, the skin no longer shone. Hangovers are a terrible thing. If only. Lewis Hamilton would have preferred his condition was attributable to the post-race action at the McLaren end-of-season party in the Museum Lounge across the street. This was more a celebration of what is to come. The Fernando Alonso experiment may have dissolved in bitterness but the punt taken on Hamilton has already paid rich dividends for McLaren, championship or not. Something he ate left him pole-axed on Monday. A scheduled press conference had to be canned as a result but he set aside his discomfort to permit a discreet audience with members of the British press. An unopened bottle of champagne lingered beside the sofa, a symbol of the fruitless end to an epic campaign. While Hamiltons stomach lay churning in his bed, the words of his estranged teammate Alonso were already flying around the ether, condemning the teams decision to appeal the stewards conclusion on fuel irregularities at the Brazilian Grand Prix. The thrust of Alonsos point was that a championship acquired in a courtroom is not one worth having. Ferrari may beg to differ. For what its worth, Hamilton agreed with Alonso. I dont believe it will happen [a successful appeal]. Everybody [opponents] did a great job. What can you say? If theyve done something wrong, then theyve done something wrong, but I want to win on the track. You want to do it in style. You want to win the race, you want to be challenging for the lead. Being promoted after people have been thrown out isnt the way I want to do it. It would feel weird after Kimi did such a fantastic job in the last few races. To have it taken away from you is cruel. Its not the way to do it, not good for the sport. Its over. We should get on. The view has been expressed elsewhere. The sports commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, said as much on touching down at Heathrow on Monday. Alonso weighed in with his tuppenceworth with the whole of Spain supporting his viewpoint. The prevailing wind is blowing in Raikkonens direction. The idea of a just win advanced by all. The only regrettable element of the rush to fall into line behind Raikkonens victory is that part of it governed by anti-Hamilton sentiment. Meanwhile, McLaren have formally lodged an appeal against the decision not to penalise three drivers in Sundays Brazilian Grand Prix because of fuel irregularities, the team said on Tuesday.

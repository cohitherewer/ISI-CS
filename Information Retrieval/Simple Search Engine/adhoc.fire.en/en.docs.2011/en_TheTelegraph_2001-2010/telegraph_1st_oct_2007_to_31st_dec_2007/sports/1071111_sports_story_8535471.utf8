 All eyes on The Glory 
 STAR RACER Calcutta: The frontline classic colt Steal The Glory will be seen in action on Sunday in the 1,400m Octogonal Cup. The Conquering Hero-Winter Dreams son has already lifted the Trial Stakes and the Derby during the monsoon season and he is eyeing the winter Classics now. Imran Chisty partners the Daniel David-trained ward.				 										Fields are big and competitive, too, in the days card but the city racegoers would have loved to see more number of events than six planned for a day like Sunday.

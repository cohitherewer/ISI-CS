 Dhoni to stay aggressive
OUR CORRESPONDENT AGENCIES Dhoni Ranchi: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Thursday said his team would continue to play with aggression. Everyone knows about his role and responsibility. And we should continue to play aggressive cricket, Dhoni told reporters. Australian captain Ricky Ponting recently said it would be interesting to see if India could sustain the aggression when they tour Down Under. Asked on Sreesanths aggression, Dhoni said: Questions do arise, and play goes on. We have guidelines and so long one plays within the frame work, it is okay. Welcoming the much-needed 10-12 days breather before India take on arch-rivals Pakistan in the five one-day series, Dhoni said: We have enough time before the tough series against Pakistan. Whatever 10-12 days time we have, we ought to utilise efficiently. It is important to relax, regenerate energy and charge our batteries before the important series ahead. On senior players not playing in the ongoing Challenger Trophy that could have given a cue to selectors, Dhoni said seniors with over 15 years experience did not have to prove themselves. Teamwork is very important. Captaincy is secondary. It is immaterial who will be the captain at one dayers or Test matches, he added.

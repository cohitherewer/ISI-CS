 Sourav: Kumble was fantastic 
 - New captain draws all-round praise for opening day show LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI He moved the chess pieces around quite well and knew what he was doing hellip; Some of his field placements were interesting  LAWSON on KUMBLENew Delhi: Despite losing the toss, overall, Thursday was an excellent first day for Anil Kumble as Indias Test captain. Its no surprise, then, that there was much appreciation both from within and outside. Besides making an impact as the man at the helm, Kumble returned the best figures  three for 38  too. Oh, Kumble was fantastic Even when he wasnt captain, I always felt he was capable of being outstanding He handled the fielding and bowling changes very well and, most important, made me bowl 12 overs! is how Indias most successful Test captain, Sourav Ganguly, lauded Kumble. That Sourav turned up to address the media after stumps caused quite a stir, but he insisted nothing should be read into his being the chosen one. Today its me, tomorrow it will be somebody else Im here only because the captain decided I should represent the team, Sourav (who himself had a good day, getting the ball to swing) explained. Getting back to Kumble, Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson also had nice words for his captaincy. He moved the chess pieces around quite well and knew what he was doing Some of his field placements were interesting, Lawson told The Telegraph. There was praise from former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja and one-time India opener Arun Lal as well. Both are doing television commentary. Kumble was very impressive He had a plan (giving short spells to bowlers) and his body language was excellent The teams body language looked off in the last session, but that can happen, Rameez said. As for Lal, he felt Kumbles use of Sourav had been brilliant. Normally, captains tend to start a fresh session with regular bowlers, but Kumble gave the ball to Sourav after lunch and he struck with his first delivery of that spell It was smart and showed Kumble thinks and probably wont be bound by conventional cricket But, then, Kumble has never been one to fit a stereotype. Footnote: Speedster Shoaib Akhtar, who was practising with teammates, was the first to congratulate Kumble when he came out of the dressing room and was heading for the toss.

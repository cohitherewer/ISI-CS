 Harikas third win on the trot
Yerevan: Top seed Women Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika continued with her fine form and downed Sopiko Guramishvili of Georgia in the fifth round of the World Junior Girls Chess Championship here. Playing white, this was Harikas third victory on the trot and it helped her reach the joint second spot behind in-form Russian Vera Nebolsina who kept her slate clean and accounted for Sarah Hoolt of Germany. Harika took her tally to four points out of a possible four and is now a full point behind Nebolsina along with compatriot WGM Eesha Karavade, Soumya Swaminathan and six others. Eesha played out a draw with Spanish Sanrina Vega Gutierrez in her fifth round game. Among other Indian girls in the fray, Mary Ann Gomes and Padmini Rout suffered defeats at the hands of Mongontuul Bathuyag of Mongolia and Bela Khotenashvili of Georgia respectively while P. Priya split the point with local Varduhi Kalashyan. In the World Juniors Championship, countrys latest GM G.N. Gopal remained within striking distance of sole leader Wesley So of Philippines after holding GM Viktor Laznicka of Czech Republic to a draw. Playing black, Gopal played solidly and did not let the cup slip from the lip. GM Deepan Chakravarthys juggernaut was halted by Dmitry Andreikin of Russia. After a loss in the first round and three victories thereafter, this was Deepans first draw in the event. (PTI)

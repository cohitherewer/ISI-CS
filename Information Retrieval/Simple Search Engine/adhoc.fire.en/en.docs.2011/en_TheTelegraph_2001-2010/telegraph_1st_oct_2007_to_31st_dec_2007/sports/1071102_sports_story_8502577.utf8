 Real storm to 5-1 win over Valencia 
Madrid: Real Madrid hit four goals in a devastating first-half spell as they stormed to a 5-1 away win over Valencia at the Mestalla on Wednesday. A second-minute strike from Raul, a Ruud van Nistelrooy double and a superb shot from defender Sergio Ramos put Bernd Schusters side 4-0 up after just 37 minutes while Robinho added a classy fifth midway through the second half. The win left Real four points clear of Villarreal at the top of the table and five ahead of Barcelona who are away at Valladolid. Villarreal moved into second spot after a crushing 3-0 win at home to basement side Levante, the goals coming courtesy of an early strike from Mexico international Guillermo Franco, a Giuseppe Rossi penalty and a Pascal Cygan header. Levante, the only side in the Primera Liga yet to post a win this season, remain anchored to the foot of the table with just one point from 10 games. Atletico Madrid moved up to fourth, level on 20 points with Barcelona after a highly entertaining 4-3 win over Sevilla at the Calderon. Argentine forward Maxi Rodriguez put 3-2 up with a spectacular flying volley 20 minutes from time and midfielder Jurado added a fourth with a classy finish before Luis Fabiano pulled back a late goal back for the visitors with his second of the night. Valencia sacked their coach Quique Sanchez Flores after Sundays 3-0 defeat at Sevilla, but if the move was designed to spark a reaction from the team it backfired spectacularly as Raul put Real in front with just over a minute on the clock. It just opened the goal-rush Valencia never recovered from. In Italy, second-placed AS Roma came from behind to beat city rivals Lazio 3-2 on Wednesday and Alberto Gilardino scored twice to help AC Milan rediscover their form with a 5-0 victory at Sampdoria. All of Serie As top sides won with David Trezeguet netting his second hattrick of the campaign in Juventuss 3-0 victory over Empoli while leaders Inter Milan beat Genoa 4-1. Fiorentina edged out Napoli 1-0 thanks to Christian Vieris second-half strike from Adrian Mutus low cross.  (Reuters)

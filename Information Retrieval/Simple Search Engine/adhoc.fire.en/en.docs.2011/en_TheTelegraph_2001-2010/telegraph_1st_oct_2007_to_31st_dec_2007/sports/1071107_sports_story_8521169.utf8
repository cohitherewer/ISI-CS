 Over with Warne, McGrath: Symonds
Melbourne: Just a day after young batsman Michael Clarke hinted that the new-look Australia were not invincible, senior teammate Andrew Symonds has declared that they were over retired stars Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath and that it was time to move on. The allrounder said the young side should not live on past glories but use the opportunity to create their own mark on world cricket. As bad as it sounds, we are over them (Warne and McGrath). Weve got to get on with it. We wont have those blokes any more, Symonds said. When we go to training, weve got to work out ways to bowl sides out and score our runs and thats what we are doing. I think it creates a great opportunity for all of us to do a little bit more. Its an exciting time for us as individuals, he was quoted as saying in a local newspaper. At Australias team meeting on Monday morning, senior players spoke about the absence of Warne and McGrath and the effect it would have on team dynamics. Vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said recent Twenty20 and ODI tours of South Africa and India had helped the transition. (PTI)

 Becks aims for revenge vs Croatia
Patrick Nathanson amp; agencies		David Beckham in Sydney on Monday. (AFP)London: England midfielder David Beckham said he was relishing the chance to make up for Englands Euro 2008 misery by gaining World Cup revenge on Croatia. England were again drawn in the same group as Croatia for the World Cup 2010 qualifiers, along with Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Andorra, just days after Slaven Bilics side knocked them out of Euro 2008 with a 3-2 win at Wembley. However, Beckham was optimistic England could overcome the challenge presented by the Eastern European teams. Its a group that theres still some very tough teams in there and obviously Croatias in there again and we have to try to get our own back on Croatia, he said. But its important that we go into the qualifiers now with a positive frame of mind, theres going to be obviously a new manager in place by then Im sure so well have to wait and see. The LA Galaxy midfielder, who is currently in Australia with his club, also reiterated his ambition of reaching 100 caps for his country. I know how things can change so quickly in the national team  eight months ago if someone would have said to me that Id be getting another cap and playing for England I probably wouldnt have believed them, Beckham said. But I was brought back in and I got up to 99 caps and I want to go on from there. I believe that I can, Im 32 years old, but I believe that Ive got the experience and the passion still to play for my country. And I hope that when the next manager comes in that he gives me that chance but well have to wait and see.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Dont burden Dhoni: Shastri
OUR CORRESPONDENT		Ravi ShastriMohali: National Cricket Academy (NCA) chairman Ravi Shastri on Tuesday said Mahendra Singh Dhoni shouldnt be burdened with Test captaincy, yet. Dhoni has done well leading the side in ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals. Burdening him now with the Test captaincy would be asking for too much. It will put him under a lot of pressure, Shastri said. The former India captain is in Mohali to check out the facilities the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) ground has to offer so that the BCCI can hold camps before tough tours such as South Africa and Australia. Dhoni, according to Shastri, can become the Test captain after gaining experience from tough tours. He needs a couple of tough tours before he is handed over the mantle, Shastri asserted. The time is not ripe to anoint him. Shastri, though, declined to comment on who should be given the responsibility after reports that Sachin Tendulkar had declined the offer. It will not be fair for me to comment. It is the selectors who will choose, he said, adding that there was no harm to have two captains till someone was ready for the task. Shastri said Sachin, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid should be told that they would be rotated. Shastri said there was need for state-level cricket academies. The NCA will provide technical knowhow. Once the state-level academies are in place in two to three years, the results will be enormous.

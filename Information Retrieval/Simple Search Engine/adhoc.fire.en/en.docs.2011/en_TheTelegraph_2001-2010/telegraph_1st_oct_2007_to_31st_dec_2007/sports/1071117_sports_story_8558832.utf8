 We have to stop the Aussies: Kumble 
 Anil Kumble Melbourne: Indias new Test captain Anil Kumble, drawing inspiration from the performance during their last tour Down Under, feels his team has the ammunition to stop the Australian juggernaut. Kumble, who has been appointed captain for the three-match home Test series against Pakistan, said though the Aussies were better than the other sides, they were not unbeatable. The way I like to look at it is that we did extremely well in Australia last time and, in fact, we had a chance to win in Sydney and we draw a lot of confidence from that, Kumble was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper. I think the gap is there, but its something for us to stop and weve done it in the past. I see no reason why we cant do it again with the experience and quality in our side, he said. Kumble said the retirement of veterans like Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer would give India an advantage in the Test series. Australia always have good players but we can use that (the retirements) to our advantage. While praising the younger players in the side, Kumble maintained he preferred to silence the opponents by putting up a good performance than being engaged in a war of words like Sreesanth. I wasnt on the field during the one-day series, so Im not in a position to say what was happening but I like let cricket do the talking we need to play to our strengths, he said. He (Sreesanth) is a great talent, but its important for him not to cross the line. Its something everyone is aware of, Kumble said. (PTI)

 Century No. 29 by Kallis
 Jacques Kallis in Centurion on Saturday Centurion: Jacques Kallis scored his fifth century in seven Test innings to establish South Africas lead over New Zealand in the second Test on Saturday. Kallis 131 was the top score in South Africas total of 272 for three, which they reached before bad light ended play seven overs after tea on Day II to earn a lead of 84 runs over New Zealands first innings of 188. Kallis 29th century was also his fastest, coming off 143 balls. The allrounder and Hashim Amla, who was 89 not out at the early close, shared a stand of 220 for the third wicket. New Zealand had resumed on 187 for the loss of eight wickets but were dismissed just four balls into the first over of play when Chris Martin edged a delivery from paceman Makhaya. Reduced to 31 for two, South Africa fought back through Amla and Kallis. Kallis scored 95 between lunch and tea before being trapped in front by debutant fast bowler Mark Gillespie with the fifth ball after tea.  (PTI)

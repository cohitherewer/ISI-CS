A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: The Eden wicket will be an ideal Test match one but the odd ball may come a bit slow said the BCCIs grounds and pitches committee chairman Daljit Singh on Monday. The wicket will initially help the pacers but later on the ball may come a bit slow, Daljit said. Satisfied with the pitch preparation which was delayed because of the rainfall, he added: We hope we will see a good Test match and going by the past record a result could very well be expected. Ticket sales for the second India-Pakistan Test is gradually picking up. CAB president Prasun Mukherjee said: The sale of daily tickets is quite encouraging. We hope to see a good turnout. Meanwhile, Sourav Ganguly arrived on Monday and will join the teammates on Tuesday.

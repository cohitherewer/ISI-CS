 Lee keen to take on Tendulkar

Melbourne: Australias pace spearhead Brett Lee is keen to challenge Sachin Tendulkar in a bid to prove to the worlds greatest that he is a vastly improved bowler now. 
I am actually looking forward to bowling against Tendulkar. Its going to be his last tour of Australia. Hes a pretty amazing player and I think any opportunity you get to play against the worlds greatest is always a good chance to see where you are as a bowler, remarked Lee. 
The fast bowler has come a long way from the previous tour by the Indians in 2003 when he played in the final three Tests and helped Australia win the Melbourne Test. 
I wasnt well when I played in MCG on that tour, said Lee, who took eight wickets at 60 runs each in that series completely dominated by the Indian batsmen. 
Lee fears that the conditions here this time around may not be too different. 
If you think about bouncy wickets in Australia, its probably only in Perth. The wickets that we have played on recently have been pretty low and slow, pretty much like a traditional Indian wicket I would think. Im hoping and praying there is a bit more life in the wicket so we can use what we know to do out here in these conditions. 
Lee didnt want to be drawn into the controversy whether Shaun Tait or Mitchell Johnson should open bowling with him. 
It would be brilliant to open the bowling with Tait but Johnson has done an outstanding job. Success against Tendulkar may give him an edge over Tait. 
It was at the MCG eight years ago when Lee made his debut against India and impressed straightaway. (PTI)

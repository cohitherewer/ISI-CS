 Karun joins new GP2 team

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
 Karun Chandhok in New Delhi on Wednesday 
New Delhi: After a successful test session with Formula One team Red Bull, Indian racing ace Karun Chandhok will now be a part of iSports international team during the 2008 GP2 Series. 
In the cockpit with him will be Bruno Senna, nephew of former Brazilian world champion, the late Ayrton Senna. Senna is a wonderful driver, said Chandhok here on Wednesday. Given his background, this sport should be in his blood. It would be exciting to drive with him, he added. 
May be with the new team I would be able to achieve the feat of Timo Glock (iSports driver), who won the GP2 championship and joined the Toyota F1 team, Chandhok said. 
Chandhok said that though he raced for Durango in the 2007 season, he decided to join iSports since it was a top flight team. 
I had a good season with Durango and won the race in Spa-Francorchamps ( Belgium ). But its a mid-field team. After all, iSport is the top flight team. There were a lot of contenders but I managed to get it, he said. 
Chandhok also expressed hopes that he will be ready for Formula One by the end of 2008. 
By 2009, I certainly would like to be in Formula One. GP2 would be an acid test for me. I think I stand a chance if I finish among the top five. In 2010, when India is suppose to host their first Grand Prix, I should be there to take part. 
In between, I will wait for more F1 opportunities from Red Bull. They have made me part of the junior team programme and Im expecting more testing opportunity with them, said the 23-year-old.

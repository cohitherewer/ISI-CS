 AIFF wants states to hold U-19 league
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: With the Professional League beginning November 23, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is planning to make it mandatory for the state associations to hold an under-19 league every season. Under the Pro League directives, all teams are supposed to have a junior team of under-19 boys apart from a squad of 25 senior professional players. In order to provide more opportunities to these players, AIFF may ask the state associations to hold annual u-19 league. AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said that the u-19 National League could not be staged for the past two seasons as there were no takers. Under the circumstances, it is not feasible to ask the teams to run junior sides as there is hardly any competition for them. A team would raise a junior side only when adequate competition is assured. The best way to do it is for the local associations to host a separate league for the junior teams. It would also give the players the required exposure, the AIFF secretary felt. Though no club has yet signed the contract for the Pro League, the AIFF seems to be going ahead vigorously to implement a few clauses involved. One of them is to compel the clubs to train their teams under licensed coaches. As of now, it has been decided to hold a 10-day seminar for coaches whenever there is a break in the Pro League. The seminar is likely to be conducted by national coach Bob Houghton. Colaco said the seminar will not primarily be only for coaches, who are currently handling the Pro League sides. There may be very few without an AFC or equivalent degree among them. Tough we are yet to give it a final shape, coaches aspiring to take up Pro League assignment may also take part in it.

 Inzy not obliged to appear in trial: PCB
Karachi: The PCB on Tuesday rubbished Darrell Hairs charges of racial discrimination and said former captain Inzamam-ul Haq was not obliged to appear as a witness in the Australian umpires case against the ICC. PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said Inzamam was not obliged to appear as a witness. The summon was served to Inzamam while he was in England playing for Yorkshire but has since returned home. Ashraf revealed that Inzamam had not approached the PCB for any help as yet, but if he did, the board would support him wholeheartedly. Hairs charges are nonsense as the entire ICC executive board took a decision against him because of his own doing, he said.  (PTI)

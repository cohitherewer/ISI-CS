 Fina drops case against Thorpe 
Sydney: Fina has dropped its case against Australias Olympic champion Ian Thorpe saying there was not sufficient evidence he took performance-enhancing drugs, reports said on Wednesday. Following a ruling in August by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority which declared the now-retired Thorpe had no case to answer, Fina has dropped its case. Thorpe faced allegations he had taken drugs after he apparently returned abnormal levels for two banned substances from a May 2006 urine sample. Thorpe had presented the ASADA with evidence and records to clear his name, strenuously denying any wrongdoing. Thorpe burst on to the world stage as a 15-year-old at the 1998 world championships and went on to become one of the sports greatest competitors. He won three gold medals as a 17-year-old at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 200 and 400m freestyle double at the 2004 Athens Olympics. He still holds the world record for 400m freestyle. (AFP)

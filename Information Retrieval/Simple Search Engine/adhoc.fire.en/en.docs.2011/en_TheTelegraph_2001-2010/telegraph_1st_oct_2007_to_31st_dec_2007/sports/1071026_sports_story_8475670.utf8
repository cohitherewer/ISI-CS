 Indians were well behaved, says Lee
 Melbourne: Australian fast bowler Brett Lee has defended the behaviour of the Indian spectators as well as cricketers like pacer Sreesanth during the recent one-day series, saying they were all well behaved. Personally, I like the controlled aggression. We know that through world cricket that we have a line in the sand that we cant overstep. If you overstep that line, well then you get penalised for it. Its all about passion. Its all about playing for your country, Lee said. Lee said the on-field verbal duels were in the right spirit. The way India have come back and fought really hard and given a bit of a mental barrage and also a bit of a verbal barrage, and theyve been saying it in the right way... It hasnt been a problem. Without being too controversial, youve got to realise theres two or three people in the crowd out of 90 to 100,000 people. I mean if you do the odds, the crowd was so well-behaved. Its the same here in Australia. The crowds here are brilliant and Im sure theyre looking forward to some great cricket, he said.Inzy eager to get going New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq Thursday said he would participate in Indian Cricket Leagues inaugural Twenty20 championship, starting in Panchkula on November 30.

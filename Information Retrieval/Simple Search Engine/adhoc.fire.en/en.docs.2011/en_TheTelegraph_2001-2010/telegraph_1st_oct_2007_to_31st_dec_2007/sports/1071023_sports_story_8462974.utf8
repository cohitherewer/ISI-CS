 Confusion over camp in city
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: There was confusion over the Team India camp in the city after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said it would decide by Tuesday evening. A senior Cricket Association of Bengal official claimed that the BCCI had cleared the camp before the series versus Pakistan on November 2 and 3. The uncertainty arose after the BCCI was informed about the unavailability of the Eden which will host Bengals opening Ranji Trophy fixture against Hyderabad from November 3. The CAB suggested CCFC as an alternative venue. We will decide by tomorrow We are still looking into the logistics, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph from Rajkot. The infrastructure at the CCFC is of the highest standard, but the nature of wickets is unknown. In 2002, England had a week-long camp there and Duncan Fletcher had complained about the wickets and its inadequate number. The first ODI versus Pakistan is in Guwahati on November 5.

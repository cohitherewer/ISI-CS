 On his day, Sourav can strike better than anybody: Kapil
 - Asias first World Cup-winning captain picks his dream Indo-Pak XI in ODIs LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL Guwahati: On the eve of the latest Indo-Pak one-day series, Indias only (and Asias first) World Cup-winning captain, Kapil Dev, chose his dream Indo-Pak XI (and the reserves) for The Telegraph. Here goes: On his criteria for selecting the XI Mainly that all have to be match-winners... Ideally, in any one-day team, all XI should be so. On his XI (in batting order) SACHIN TENDULKAR: Do I actually need to say anything? I dont think anybody has had as much time as him to play shots... That he hasnt lost the hunger or the will, despite being around for 18 years, is remarkable. SOURAV GANGULY: On his day, he can strike better than anybody... Fielding is his one weak point, but dont forget he could chip in with some overs, especially if conditions are overcast. SAEED ANWAR: Another match-winner... Probably wasnt the most attractive batsman to watch, but very effective and could raise the tempo of his game at will. MOHAMMED AZHARUDDIN: A fantastic one-day player... Watching him on song was such a delight... Then, he was such a brilliant fielder. INZAMAM-UL HAQ: Has ended his career with a great record and had the ability to win single-handedly. Thats an awesome quality. JAVED MIANDAD: Every team, I suppose, needs somebody notorious! I mean, Javed could be used to needle the opposition... Seriously, though, my dream XI has to have a fighter like him. Besides unsettling the opponents, he could lift his own team. MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI: Hes also a match-winner, isnt he? Hes not the finest keeper Ive seen in India or Pakistan, for weve had Wasim Bari and Syed Kirmani and Moin Khan, but what sets Dhoni apart is his ability to force a win single-handedly. IMRAN KHAN: An allrounder who had the ability to run through any team... Most definitely a match-winner of the highest quality. WASIM AKRAM: Certainly the finest left-arm paceman of all time... He could swing the ball both when it was new and old... Indeed, he could do anything with the ball... A true champion. ANIL KUMBLE: Very focused, very disciplined... An amazing bowler, particularly in the subcontinent. WAQAR YOUNIS: Terrific whatever the conditions... His record speaks for itself... You could make out he was always giving that one hundred per cent. On who would be best suited to captain his dream XI Imran... Besides being an outstanding allrounder, he was a positive captain and showed his worth as a leader when Pakistan won the 1992 World Cup. On the reserves Id first go for Abdul Qadir... In fact, it was tough leaving him out of the XI... Then, Ill pick three batsmen  Salim Malik, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh... As when I chose Azhar, Ive selected Malik for what he did on the field... (After a pause) Much has been made of Sehwags footwork, but he has shown you can get runs even if you dont have Sunil Gavaskars technique. Finally, his choice for the coachs position (Grins) Id prefer the designation cricket manager... It has to be somebody of stature, somebody respected by everybody... Either (Mansur Ali Khan) Pataudi or Gavaskar Any one of them would do a good job.

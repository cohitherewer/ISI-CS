 Dravid falls 2 rungs in ICC rankings

 - Sourav, Sachin move up

Calcutta: Rahul Dravids poor performance in the Boxing Day Test saw him drop two places to 14th in the latest LG ICC Test rankings for batsmen. 
However there was good news for Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. Indias top scorer in the first innings, Tendulkar, moved up a place to 17th. Sourav, who scored 43 and 40 in the first Test, climbed a place to be 18th, according to an ICC release on Sunday. 
Despite the defeat in Melbourne, skipper Anil Kumble finds himself one place up at the fourth slot in the bowlers rankings, which has Zaheer Khan static at 13th. 
Meanwhile, Sri Lankas Kumar Sangakkara returned to the top of the Test batsmen rankings for the second time in three weeks after Australias Ricky Ponting and South Africas Jacques Kallis suffered rare batting failures in the Melbourne and Port Elizabeth Tests respectively. 
Ponting had entered the Boxing Day Test leading second-placed Kallis by one rating point and third-placed Sangakkara by three. But his contribution of four and three in his teams 337-run victory over India meant he has conceded 19 ratings points to fall behind the two on 917 points. 
Kallis also squandered an opportunity to surge to the top when he was dismissed for a duck in the first innings of his teams 128-run defeat to the West Indies. Despite managing 85 in his second dig, it was not enough to avoid losing 12 ratings points, illustrating just what it takes to stay at the top these days. Kallis did just enough for him to hang on to his second place on 923 points. 
There were all smiles in the West Indies camp after their first Test victory in 31 months and maiden win on South African soil. Captain Chris Gayle, who scored 66 and 29, jumped five places to 23rd while opener Daren Ganga climbed 11 places to 58th. 
The West Indies bowlers are also on an upward move. While Fidel Edwards retained his place in 34th position, Jerome Taylor jumped seven places to 35th spot. 
In the allrounders rankings, Chris Gayle leapfrogged Indias Irfan Pathan in sixth place.

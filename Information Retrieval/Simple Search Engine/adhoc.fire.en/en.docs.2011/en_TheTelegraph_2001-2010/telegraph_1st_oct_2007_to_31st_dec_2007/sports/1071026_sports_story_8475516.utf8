 Drogba pulls up Ballack
GILES MOLEDidier Drogba has once again courted controversy amongst the Chelsea hierarchy by suggesting Michael Ballack made a mistake signing for Chelsea. The Ivory Coast international says Ballack should have joined rivals Manchester United or Arsenal, where he would have been better suited to their style of play. These latest comments will come as further embarrassment to Chelsea bosses still reeling from an interview he gave to a French sports publication, claiming he wants to leave the club as soon as possible in the wake of Jose Mourinhos dismissal. Regarding Ballack, Drogba told a British daily: Its hard for Ballack at Chelsea because this club is special. Im convinced he would have had a much easier time at Manchester United or Arsenal because they benefit from their well-balanced team, he would have been a better fit there. At Chelsea we depend on our individuals so maybe Chelsea is not the right club for Ballack. The German international, 31, moved to Stamford Bridge from Bayern Munich on a free transfer, but has so far failed to make an impact and was even left out of the teams Champions League squad list. He is currently recovering from ankle surgery and admits the length of time he has had to endure on the sidelines is becoming more and more frustrating. Initially Ballack was told he would return to training in three-to-four weeks. Instead six months and two operations have passed. Ballack said: Its frustrating, but I can only say Im not a doctor, but a player. Some injuries are simple and some are complicated. But it looks good now. Im on the field. I can work with the ball. I can do everything. I hope to be team training soon. The fact that Ballack will be fit and playing soon makes it all the more confusing as to why Chelsea made him unavailable for European competition, a fact not lost on Drogba. He said: I was very surprised he was not nominated because he was one of our team leaders. Of course he is still a leader now. His experience and his strength in the air make him indispensable. But I dont know what happened between him and the front office. While Drogbas views may not endear him to the board, Chelseas players have stuck by the striker, with Petr Cech and captain John Terry publically showing their support.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

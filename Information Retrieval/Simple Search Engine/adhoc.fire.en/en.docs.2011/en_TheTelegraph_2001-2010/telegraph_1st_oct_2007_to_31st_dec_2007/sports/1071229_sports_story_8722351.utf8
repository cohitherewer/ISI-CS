London: Blackburn Rovers snatched a 2-2 Premier League draw at Manchester City after their Paraguayan striker Roque Santa Cruz scored his second of the night in the 84th minute on Thursday. 
City, who had won all their previous nine home league games this season, had been leading after three goals were scored in a thrilling three-minute spell midway through the first half. 
Bulgarian midfielder Martin Petrov, in superb form, provided a perfect cross for Darius Vassell to head City into a 27th minute lead. 
Blackburn levelled a minute later when Santa Cruz met David Bentleys free-kick with a glancing header, but City were back in front when Petrov broke down the left and the square pass was slid into his own net by Rovers defender Ryan Nelsen. 
Blackburn came out much sharper after the break and their pressure was rewarded at the end when Santa Cruz nodded in his seventh goal in four games off another Bentley cross. 
The draw kept City fifth in the table, on 35 points, one behind fourth-placed Liverpool and 10 adrift of leaders Manchester United. Blackburn are ninth on 27 points. 
Meanwhile, Chelsea and Newcastle face selection problems ahead of their Premier League game on Saturday  and not just because of injury and suspension. 
Newcastle midfielder Joey Barton will spend the next six days in jail after being refused bail Friday and charged with common assault and affray, or starting a brawl. 
At least Chelseas issues are limited to injuries and suspensions. Midfielder Frank Lampard was ruled out for several weeks on Thursday after hurting his right thigh during Chelseas dramatic 4-4 draw against Aston Villa on Wednesday. 
Defender John Terry, medio Florent Malouda and striker Didier Drogba were missing that match with injuries and defender Ricardo Carvalho and Ashley Cole received automatic three-match suspensions after being sent off. 
One person has benefited from the injury list  striker Andriy Shevchenko. He scored two goals and set up a third against Villa and also scored against Liverpool in the League Cup quarter finals on December 19. 
I feel I played well against Villa, but for me the result of the team is more important, Shevchenko said. But I feel much better, and my confidence is good. I want to play every game and do my best on the pitch. 
Chelsea fell off the title chase last season when it drew three straight games after Christmas. But Chelseas unbeaten streak in the league at Stamford Bridge is 72 games and Bartons arrest isnt the only problem for Newcastle. 
Allardyce has only been at Newcastle since April, but is aware his future is shaky after a run of poor results. Newcastle is obviously a big club, but we all love the gaffer, Newcastle winger Damien Duff said. We are behind him and we just want to put it right for him. He cannot take all the flak. We are the ones on the pitch  so dont hammer him, hammer us.

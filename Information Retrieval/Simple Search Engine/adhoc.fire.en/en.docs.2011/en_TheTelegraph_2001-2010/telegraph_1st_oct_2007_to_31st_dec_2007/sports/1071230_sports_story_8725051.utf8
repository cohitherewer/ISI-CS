 US too good for Sania, Rohan 

Perth: The United States made light of the temporary absence of Serena Williams as they beat India 2-1 in their opening group A match at the Hopman Cup on Saturday. 
Meghann Shaughnessy, standing in for the world No. 7, gave the US a perfect start to the warm-up event for next months Australian Open by beating Sania Mirza 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. 
Mardy Fish sealed the tie with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Rohan Bopanna before the Indian pair took the doubles 6-4, 6-4. 
Williams is due to arrive in Perth in time for her teams second group match in the eight-nation mixed-team tournament against the Czech Republic on Monday. 
World No. 52 Shaughnessy won the first four games against an erratic Sania and looked on course for a quick win when she led by a set and 2-0. 
However, Sania hit back to level and then took command at 3-1 in the decider only to falter when it mattered  losing the last five games to hand Shaughnessy the win. 
I got the call a couple of days ago, said Shaughnessy, who left within minutes of the doubles to catch a flight to Australias Gold Coast, where she is due to play in the WTA event starting on Sunday. 
Sania blamed the loss on leg cramps but expressed satisfaction with her form.

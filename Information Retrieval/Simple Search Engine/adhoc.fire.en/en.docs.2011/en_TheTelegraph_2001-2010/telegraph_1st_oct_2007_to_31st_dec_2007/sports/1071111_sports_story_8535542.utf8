 CRICKET BRIEFS 
 Warne plays his parents in TV ad 
	 Melbourne: This has got to be one of Shane Warne rsquo;s best. The Australian spin legend plays his own mom and dad in a television commercial. 
	 The retired leg-spinner dressed up as his father Keith and mother Brigitte for an advertising campaign of VB beer and said he ldquo;absolutely loved rdquo; the experience. 
	 ldquo;It was fantastic. I had a great time dressing up as my old man and my mother. I even had the chance to be baby Warnie. It was a hoot, rdquo; Warne was quoted as saying in a daily. 
	 The 38-year-old flamboyant cricketer said it took him just a couple of hours to age for the camera and make fun of himself. 
	 ldquo;I absolutely loved doing the ads. It took a couple of hours to get made up for each character, but it was a load of fun. I felt really comfortable dressing up as my father. It was cool, completely different. I felt like I was Tom Selleck, Magnum Pi or someone, rdquo; he said. 
	 ldquo;I think the ads are very funny and hopefully everyone else thinks they are as well. The bald head, the long socks, the retro VB can, I loved it all, rdquo; he added. Solanki joins ICL 
	 London: Despite a strict advisory by England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to stay away from Indian Cricket League (ICL), Vikram Solanki has joined the rebel league, according to media reports. 
	 ldquo;Vikram Solanki has become the third England player to join the rebel league. The Worcestershire skipper is due to join fellow County captains Paul Nixon and Darren Maddy in a move that could end his international career, rdquo; according to a report in British media. Solanki, 31, has played 51 one-day Internationals. Meanwhile, the ECB is putting pressure on the Counties to reconsider allowing players to sign deals with the ICL. However, the players are not bound by ECB contracts during the winter.  Sami scalps 8 
	 Karachi: Pakistan rsquo;s discarded pacer Mohammed Sami reminded the national selectors of his presence with a brilliant eight-wicket haul against Sialkot in a Quaid-e-Azam Trophy first class match here on Saturday.

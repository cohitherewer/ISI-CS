 Chelsea approach Ajax coach
 London: Chelsea are lining up Ajax coach Henk ten Cate to join manager Avram Grants backroom staff at Stamford Bridge. Grant, who was promoted from director of football to replace Jose Mourinho, has targeted the international break as a chance to rebuild the coaching set-up, with the Ajax coach thought to be one of the men he wants on board. It is unclear whether Grant, the Israeli coach, would appoint Ten Cate in the director of football role, or whether he wants the former Barcelona assistant to work alongside his current No. 2 Steve Clarke. According to a Dutch magazine website, Chelsea technical director Frank Arnesen has held talks with 52-year-old Ten Cate about a possible move to west London. The Dutch club have yet to comment on the matter. Cristiano eyes European glory  London: Cristiano Ronaldo is someone who wears dark glasses well but on Thursday he is wearing them for a reason.

Scolari ban reduced  Berne: Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolaris four-match ban during the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign has effectively been reduced to three matches following a meeting of Uefas appeals body. Uefa said on Thursday the ban had been changed to three months, including one month suspended, allowing Scolari to resume his coaching duties one day before his teams final qualifying match against group A rivals Finland on November 21.

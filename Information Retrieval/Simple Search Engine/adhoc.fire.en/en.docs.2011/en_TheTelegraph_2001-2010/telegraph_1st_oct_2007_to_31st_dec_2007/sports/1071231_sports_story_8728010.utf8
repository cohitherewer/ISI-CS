 Title defence will be tough, says Malisse

Chennai: Having recuperated from a wrist injury which kept him away from the court for most of the year, Xavier Malisse is happy with his form and fitness but admits it would be tough to defend his Chennai Open title. 
Malisse said the draw was strong, quite open and that anyone could reach the final. He felt Spaniard Rafael Nadal and Russian Mikhail Youzhny would be strong contenders. 
Everybody has to play a high quality game. The draw is tough. I have to take it round by round and plan for the next. I will do my best, he said. 
The 27-year-old Belgian took part in only five tournaments after suffering a wrist injury in February. 
Before sustaining it, Malisse won both singles and doubles titles in Chennai in January. 
I played perhaps my best tennis last year while beating Nadal. The season is just beginning. I am happy to be really fit now. That is the main reason I have come here to play, he said here on Sunday. 
Malisse said he had played in the US Open and an ATP series at home since returning from injury. 
I have worked well in training for 45 days. Match and training is different. I have to get into match rhythm. Thats what I am up to and I am totally fit now. 
It is the beginning of the year and a new season is starting. Like all players, I look forward to an enjoyable year, he said. 
The Belgian said he would use the season opener to prepare for the first Grand Slam of the year. (PTI)

 We have more than just one or two guys to make an impact: Ponting
 - The Australian captain is following in Steve Waughs footsteps LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI		Ricky PontingMumbai: Predecessor Steve Waughs association with under-privileged children in India is well documented. Whats not very well known is that Ricky Ponting is also doing his bit, through the ING Vyasa Foundation, an initiative of the ING Vyasa Bank. Every run that the 32-year-old Australian captain scores in ODIs between now  actually, it started with his first appearance in the ongoing series, in Hyderabad  and next September will benefit one underprivileged child whose education is going to be taken care of by the Foundation. As Ponting has so far scored 142 runs, the Foundation is already committed to sponsoring that many children under the Run Ricky Run project. Besides, Ponting has been auctioning bats and photographs (signing a coffee table book too), proceeds of which will go to the Foundation. On Monday night, for example, the auction here raised Rs 4,42,000 through two bats and Rs 3,77,000 through three photographs. Before the auction, Ponting took questions from a select gathering and, on Tuesday afternoon, briefly spoke to The Telegraph. The following are excerpts On lending his name to a noble cause Im fortunate that I can do such things It gives a lot of satisfaction Its something I enjoy doing. On whether he gets the time for such activities back in Australia Oh, yes Im quite closely involved with the Sydney Cancer Centre I try and manage time As Ive said, Im one of the lucky few to be able to lend my name to charitable causes. On defeating Team India so convincingly in the ongoing series (Laughs) I havent played a huge role Andrew Symonds and Mitchell Johnson, Matthew Hayden and Brett Lee need to be asked why theyve beaten India so convincingly! On having come out all guns blazing Except for playing in the World Twenty20, wed been off cricket for a full four months The boys have been very keen and our one-day cricket has been terrific. On the bad blood between the teams I think things only got out of hand in the second ODI (Kochi) and the Match Referee (Chris Broad) spoke to Mahendra (Singh Dhoni) and myself It has been fine after that In fact, after the third ODI (Hyderabad), the Match Referee congratulated us both for ensuring that the match had been played in the right spirit. Mahendra and I made an effort I hope the last ODI and the Twenty20 are also going to be played in the right spirit. On on-field exchanges I dont have a problem as long as it doesnt get personal There should be no personal abuse I dont think there are many international sport where theres as much pressure as in cricket. On whether hed expected the Indian bowlers to be aggressive Going by what some of them said before the ODIs began, yes Didnt take us by surprise Were fine with that. On whether, nowadays, the rival teams have much less time to socialise There are a lot more things to do in the evenings There are recovery sessions and (Socialising) Thats probably one thing that has died out Of course, Ive played against some of the Indian players for a number of years and, so, know them (well) I dont know some of the newer ones. On motivating players It must not be left to somebody to motivate Wearing the Australia cap is motivation enough. On the Australians constantly striving for the next level Our players are never happy with what theyve achieved The batters want to score more in the next match and the bowlers want to take more wickets We try to do a few things differently Try and get better On Australia having posted three 300-plus totals in the ongoing series Players have taken responsibility The other day (in Nagpur), Symonds took his time in the first 30-40 balls and, then, played the innings he did He was lucky to get dropped, but realised he had a responsibility to see the team through a difficult phase. Under pressure, our players have stood up to be counted We have more than just one or two guys to make an impact Weve shown that. On the about-to-end tour Weve got two matches to go and theres no better place than Mumbai to be in On whether 400 could become the benchmark in ODIs Theres every indication that it will It depends on the mindset of batsmen Its about batting without fear... Even Test match totals have, in recent years, got bigger and have come faster too. On strategy Has to be flexible Has to keep changing On Wednesday, it would be best to win the toss, score 300-plus and defend it! On the approach he would like his players to take, irrespective of the situation Im never going to have a go at somebody for having been positive They should always play to their strength  which is being positive Theyve got to play their natural game On few actually making the Australian team at a young age Yes, the average age of our side is 31 or so, which makes our team one of the oldest I made my first-class debut at a very early age (17), but not many do so The selectors are aware of this Weve had some champion players and theyve had a long innings. On the competition in international cricket Today, every team is ultra-competitive. On cricket in India I first came here with an Academy team in 1991-92 So, Ive been coming for a number of years The evolution of cricket has been staggering and the amount of money generated is staggering as well We want to come to India and want to do well here. On Team India, despite being 1-3 down, deciding to see a movie in the lead-up to the Nagpur ODI I dont know what they did At times it helps to take a break and stop thinking about cricket 24x7 For, if the goings not good, then the mind can become more congested. If watching a movie is one way out of that, so be it. On his interests outside cricket Golf and Australian Rules Football I was into Australian Rules till about the age of 16 or so, thats when I decided to focus wholly on cricket. In Australia, there are other sport which compete (with cricket) for the kids attention. Thats not so in India. Finally, on the golfer hed like to be (Laughs again) Tiger Woods Wouldnt even mind being his caddy!

 Alonso quizzed
Milan: Double world champion Fernando Alonso was interviewed by magistrate Giuseppe Tibis for more than two hours on Tuesday as part of a legal probe into Formula Ones spying controversy, the magistrate said. McLaren were stripped all their constructors points and fined $100m last month after being found guilty of benefitting from the possession of Ferrari information. Emails between Alonso and the teams test driver Pedro de la Rosa about Ferrari were used as evidence in a hearing of the FIA, which led to McLarens punishment. Alonso was called to Modena as a witness and a person in knowledge of the facts.  (REUTERS)

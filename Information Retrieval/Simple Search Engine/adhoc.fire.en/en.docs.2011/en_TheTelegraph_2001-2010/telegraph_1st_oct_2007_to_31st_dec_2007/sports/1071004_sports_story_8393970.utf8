 Armstrong: US jury wouldve let off Landis
 Armstrong New York: Lance Armstrong believes an American jury surely would have ruled in favour of Floyd Landis, unlike the arbitrators who found him guilty of doping. The seven-time Tour de France winner lamented the consequences of the panel disregarding shoddy lab work in his first public comments about last months decision to ban Landis for two years and strip him of his 2006 Tour de France title. I didnt follow Floyds case that much, but I will tell you, if theres a jury trial in the US, with eight or 10 or 12 of our fellow citizens, you get off every time, Armstrong said on Tuesday while promoting a new line of Nike apparel that supports his Livestrong campaign to fight cancer. Armstrong, who has endured doping accusations throughout his career, has criticised the French lab where Landis tests were conducted. Although the arbitrators faulted the labs practices in their ruling and warned that future errors could result in the dismissal of a positive finding, the panel still upheld Landis positive doping test. When you are giving someone the death penalty, which they essentially did, you cannot tolerate shoddy work, which they clearly did, Armstrong said. I dont understand that type of rationale. I dont understand the verdict. Its tough for Floyd; its tough for cycling. But at the same time, its also really tough and unfortunate for the fans of all athletes. You never know when youre in that position, when an athletes in that position, and you want to make sure that every things done right. Armstrong conceded that cycling is going through a tough period. But I think all of sport is going through a tough time, he said. You can look at cycling and say, oh, theyre all cheaters. But you know what? You can look at the Mclaren Formula one team and say theyre cheaters. Last month, Mclaren was fined $100 million for spying on rival Ferrari. Its top-level sport, Armstrong said of cycling. Theres a lot of money, a lot of pride, a lot of fame on the line. People are going to cut corners. Its the job of the governing bodies and the police and all these agencies to make sure what were watching is pure and clear. Armstrong said he hopes the money generated by big-time sports can help his foundation fight cancer. (AP)

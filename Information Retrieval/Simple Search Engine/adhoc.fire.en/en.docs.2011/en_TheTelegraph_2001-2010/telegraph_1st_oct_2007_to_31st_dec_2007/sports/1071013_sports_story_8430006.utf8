 Rajput confident of squaring series
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni arrives in Nagpur on Friday Nagpur: It would require a Herculean effort, especially after the thrashing at Vadodara, but Indian team is confident of squaring the seven-match rubber against Australia which they are currently trailing 1-3, said cricket manager Lalchand Rajput on Friday. Why not? The boys are confident. They have come back from 0-2 down in England to level the series 3-3. We will go in with a positive intent and the boys are very confident, said Rajput two days before the sixth ODI at the VCA Stadium here. The boys will have the urge to do well playing at home, added Rajput. Rajput conceded that the team was outplayed totally at Vadodara but insisted it was just a one-off thing. It was one bad day for us. It was a fantastic new ball spell from the Australians, he said. Sachin (Tendulkar) batted very well but there was no one to support him after we had lost five wickets (for 43), he pointed out. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and some of his teammates watched Bollywood movie Bhool Bhulaiyaa at a local cineplex later in the evening.  (PTI)

 Kumbles experience a big plus, says Borde
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Pakistan, 0-1 down in the 3-match series, are plagued with injuries ahead of the Eden Test and former India captain Chandu Borde sees no reason why India should not wrap up the series here. A CAB special invitee for the second Test, the septuagenarian regretted that he will be unable to make it to the city to watch the match that begins on Friday. Its something that Ill miss... For some personal reasons, Ill not be able to travel to Calcutta. Eden Gardens is a great venue, I always enjoyed playing here... The crowd is quite knowledgeable. Theres a lot of love and passion for the game there, Borde told The Telegraph from Pune. Praising Anil Kumbles captaincy, Borde said. The fact that hes an experienced campaigner is certainly a plus.. He knows when to bring in which bowler, depending on the match situation. We should look for a victory to wrap up the series. The boys are in tremendous form and I dont see any difficulty in wrapping up the series here. That the Pakistan team is plagued with so many injured players is also an advantage.

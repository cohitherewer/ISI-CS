 CRICKET BRIEFS 
						 Lee to record album 				 in India						
							 Melbourne: Brett Lee plans to record and						 release his first studio album in India during breaks						 in his playing schedule over the next year. He is also looking forward						 to doing charity work and getting movie offers in the country.						
	 Having fielded and rejected several approaches from movie producers,						 Lee hopes to grace India rsquo;s silver screen after his cricketing						 career. He is also in the process of forming a charitable fund						 in India. ldquo;Steve Waugh is loved over here because he has						 done so much charity work, and that rsquo;s how I would like						 to be remembered as well: someone who enjoyed his cricket, but				 also put a fair bit back in, rdquo; Lee said.						
	 Aussie-Pak Twenty20 						
	 Lahore: The first Twenty20 International in Pakistan						 will be played early next year when the hosts take						 on Australia during their tour in March-April. Cricket						 Australia has confirmed the itinerary for the tour						 that includes three Tests, five ODIs and the Twenty20				 match, besides a three-day practice game.						
	 Pak board eyes bigger TV deal						
	 Lahore: The PCB has started getting queries from						 interested bidders for the international and domestic						 TV rights of Pakistan cricket. The PCB rsquo;s contract with Dubai-based						 TEN Sports expires with the Australian tour next year. A source						 said the board was expecting to earn much more than				 the $43.2 million-four year deal they have with TEN sports.

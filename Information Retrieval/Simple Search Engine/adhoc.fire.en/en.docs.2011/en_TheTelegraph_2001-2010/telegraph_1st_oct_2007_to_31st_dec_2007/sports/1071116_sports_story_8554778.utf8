 F1 signs track deal 
New Delhi: Formula One bosses have signed a deal with an Indian company to build a race track near Delhi. JP Associates chairman Manoj Gaur confirmed that F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone had signed a 10-year contract with the company to build the track in Greater Noida and express confidence that Formula One would grow in leaps and bounds in the coming years. We hope that like Twenty20 cricket, popularity of Formula One will also be boundless, he said. When contacted, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi said: Im not aware of this development, adds Our Special Correspondent in New Delhi. The IOA had been instrumental behind inviting Formula One to India and two sites on the outskirts of the capital had been okayed for the purpose. Later, famous track architect Hermann Tilke visited the sites and submitted a report to Ecclestone. India has been hoping to stage a Grand Prix since Narain Karthikeyan became the first Indian Formula One driver in 2005. (Agencies)

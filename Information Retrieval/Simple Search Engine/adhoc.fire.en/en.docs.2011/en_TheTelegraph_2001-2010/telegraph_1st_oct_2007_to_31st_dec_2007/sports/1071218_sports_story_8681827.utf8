 PCB must act tough, says Younis

 Younis Khan 
Karachi: Pakistans senior pro Younis Khan feels the PCB needs to take a few tough decisions. 
In an interview before leaving for Haj, Younis, who has expressed his willingness to become the Test captain, said he needed six months to turn the team into a winning combination. 
I am prepared to be the captain but on certain conditions. The bottom line is some difficult decisions have to be taken in the larger interest of the team and if the PCB can take them, I assure you positive results would be visible within six months. 
Younis, who has so far been reluctant to be the skipper and turned down the offer earlier this year after the World Cup, said he may play for another two to three years. 
If I can do something for Pakistan cricket as captain I would be very happy. 
But I want to lead on my own terms. This is necessary to be successful. Some changes have to be made, he added. 
Younis said former captains such as Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Inzamam-ul Haq had been urging him to shoulder the responsibility. 
I am not keen on it but since I respect the views of these former captains, I have decided to accept the challenge. 
I doubt the PCB will make me the captain at this juncture but I have put the ball in their court, he stated. 
The PCB, meanwhile, is deliberating a rotation policy aimed at reducing the workload on senior players. 
Chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said on Monday that the matches against Zimbabwe in January and February would be used to give exposure to the fringe players. 
The chief selector said players such as Mohammed Irshad, Abdul Rauf, Sohail Khan, Khalid Latif and Khurrum Manzoor, who had done well in domestic matches and for the Pakistan A team in recent times, would be tried out.

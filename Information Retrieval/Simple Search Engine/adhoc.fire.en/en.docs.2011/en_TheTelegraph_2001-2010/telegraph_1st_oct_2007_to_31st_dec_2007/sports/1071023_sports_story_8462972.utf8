 Buchanans new role
A STAFF REPORTER John Buchanan will be amabassador for Cricket Coaches Australia Calcutta: Cricket Australia on Monday announced that former coach John Buchanan has accepted a new role as ambassador for Cricket Coaches Australia. After retiring as Australian coach I have been looking to stay involved in cricket in some form, so I am excited to be taking on the ambassadorship with Cricket Coaches Australia. The importance of coaching to the health of Australian cricket is something I am passionate about and I hope to use my experience to shape the next generation of coaches around Australia, Buchanan said after the announcement. I have a passion for coaching and a strong desire to educate coaches in providing a safe, fun and inclusive environment for their players he added. It was learnt that Buchanan, as an ambassador will conduct coaching seminars around Australia, write articles for the Cricket Coaches Australia monthly magazine Overview along with helping to shape the direction of coach education. Buchanan is arguably the most successful coach in Australian sports history. So it is a tremendous asset for Cricket Australia to retain his knowledge and passion for coaching. He will have an active role in working with volunteer coaches at the local level and also promoting the importance of coach education programs and CCA membership, Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said.

 Ive never batted so fluently: Jaffer
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Wasim Jaffer led the Indian domination on the opening day of the second Test with an unbeaten 92. The following are excerpts from what the opener said at the press conference on Friday: Q Are you happy with your performance? A Im very happy with todays performance Ive never batted so fluently in my Test career. I was not taking risks and concentrated on cricketing shots. Will try to get 200 and more tomorrow Will this hundred rank as special? All hundreds are special and I have got only a few Scoring 192 in a day is something I havent done before. That way this innings is special. How did you find the wicket? The wicket is not slow like in Delhi We also have to consider that the Pakistan attack was comparatively weak because of Shoaib Akhtar not being fully fit. Would you like to compare this with any of your previous knocks? I cannot compare this innings with any of my previous knocks. Im happy that we are in a strong position at the end of Day I. Having failed to build on your starts in previous occasions, were you extra cautious this time? In England, I was getting the starts but couldnt build on them. So I was very focused today and was bent on carrying on after I got past 50 You have big scores in the domestic circuit too Ive gone through many lean phases in my career. Ive been dropped two or three times and gone back to Ranji Trophy, got big scores and came back. Im used to scoring big. Its just that I havent done that much in international cricket and Ill try to do that from here on. How hard has it been to cope with being left out ? This phase hurts you but also teaches you a lot of things How to work on in bad times and make the most of the circumstances It makes me come back stronger each time. Dinesh Karthik must be having a similar feeling I realise how Karthik must be feeling after two bad knocks. I empathise with him. I have gone through it I know how it feels I wish him all the luck. Didnt Shoaib Akhtar not being at his best make a big difference? Shoaib is their strike bowler. His not being fit did hurt them It did make a difference. You seemed to smile once the giant screen focused on your wife after you reached your hundred. Did her presence disturb your concentration? (Laughs) I always keep an eye on my wife Are you aiming to overtake Virender Sehwags 309? Lets see Let me get my first run tomorrow. Only then will I think of it What did the mid-pitch discussions centre around when batting with Rahul Dravid or Sachin Tendulkar? Nothing special when batting with Dravid or Sachin. Whenever I was doing anything wrong, they were telling me where I was going wrong and vice versa I have a good understanding with both. Any special plans for the tour Down Under? Thats sometime away Im not thinking too much ahead and focusing on this tour. That will be different the bowling and the conditions.

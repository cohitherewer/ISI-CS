 Dont worry, I can still do it: Hamilton
VICKI HODGESLewis Hamilton is confident he can still win the world championship despite suffering a setback at the Chinese GP on Sunday. Hamilton was forced to retire in Shanghai and could only watch as his McLaren teammate and rival Fernando Alonso cut his lead from 12 points to four with a second-place finish. Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen is seven points off Hamilton in the race for the title after his victory in China set-up a three-way showdown at the final race of the season in Brazil in two weeks time. Hamilton remains upbeat of becoming the first driver to clinch the championship in his debut season and said after his retirement: Weve still got one more race to go. Dont worry, I can still do it. Well-worn weather tyres forced Hamilton to slide off the track just as he was coming in to the pit lane and he said: I was having a great race and we didnt know whether it was going to rain or not. The tyres I was on were getting worse and worse and in the end I could almost see the canvas underneath. Coming into the pits it was like ice. I couldnt do anything about it. My mirrors were dirty, I couldnt see the tyres but it felt like they were completely finished. Hamilton said he was disappointed to have made his first mistake of the season but is focused on finishing on a high note in Brazil. When I got out of the car I was just gutted because I hadnt made a mistake all year and to do it on the way to the pits is not something I usually do. But you cant go through life without making mistakes. Im over it, now we can look to Brazil.  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

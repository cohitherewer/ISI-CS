 Durgapur school in final
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Sagarbhanga High School (Durgapur), comprising players from Mohun Bagan-SAIL Academy, entered the final of the under-17 Subroto Cup football meet here on Wednesday. Coached by Santosh Mondal, the Durgapur boys were stretched till extra time at the Ambedkar Stadium before they earned a 3-2 verdict over Om Roy High School (Shillong). They became the first Bengal team in seven years to reach the final of Indias most prestigious inter-school tournament. A delighted Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra, when contacted in Calcutta, said the hard work put in by the club has paid off. We have been crying hoarse for many years to make it mandatory for all state associations to set up at least one academy each, but the AIFF hasnt accepted our proposal. For the winners, Dipendu Dori scored twice while Ram Mullick struck the match-winner two minutes into extra time. Lamlangki and Sanely scored for the Shillong school. In the final, the Durgapur school will take on the winners of NCC (NER) and Goan outfit Rosary High School, scheduled to clash in the other semi-final. The Bengal schools squad has been reduced to 13 as three of their players were found to be over age.

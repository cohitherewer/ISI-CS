 Arsenal back on top of table
 Arsenals Robin van Persie celebrates his goal against Sunderland in London on Sunday. (Reuters) London: Arsenal beat Sunderland 3-2 on Sunday to move back to the top of the Premier League after Robin van Persie secured victory with a well worked winner 10 minutes from time. It was Arsenals tenth successive win in all competitions but they made hard work of it after racing into a 2-0 lead in the opening 14 minutes before allowing Sunderland to pull level early in the second half. Manchester United, who beat Wigan Athletic 4-0 on Saturday and led the table overnight, slipped back to second, with Sven-Goran Erikssons Manchester City consolidating their third place with their fifth straight home league win, 3-1 over Middlesbrough. Liverpool, beaten 1-0 by Olympique Marseille in the Champions League at Anfield on Wednesday, were just 90 seconds away from another home defeat when Fernando Torres scored with a header to force a 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur, whose goals came from Robbie Keane either side of halftime. Chelsea scored for the first time in five league matches to win 1-0 at Bolton Wanderers where Salomon Kalou grabbed the only goal after 41 minutes. Arsenals victory took them on to 22 points from eight matches, followed by United on 20 from nine and Manchester City, 19 from nine. Liverpool are fourth with 16 points from eight games. Portsmouth, who won 2-0 at Fulham, are fifth with 15 points. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was a relieved man after their victory over Sunderland. Van Persie put the Gunners ahead with a blistering free-kick after seven minutes while Senderos made it 2-0 with a scrappy goal seven minutes later. Sunderland came back into the match with goals from Ross Wallace and Kenwyne Jones before Van Persie scored Arsenals late winner after being freed up by substitute Theo Walcott. Meanwhile, there was some good and bad news for England coach Steve McClaren. Frank Lampard returned to the Chelsea side after missing the last seven matches with a torn thigh muscle while Michael Owen, who had a groin operation last week, came on as a late substitute and scored in Newcastle Uniteds 3-2 win over Everton at St James Park. They should both be available for Englands important Euro 2008 qualifiers against Estonia and Russia later this month, but Andy Johnson, who scored for Everton in the defeat at Newcastle, pulled out of the squad with an ankle injury. Derby stay bottom with five points after losing 1-0 at Reading, while Bolton also have five points after losing to Chelsea.  (REUTERS)

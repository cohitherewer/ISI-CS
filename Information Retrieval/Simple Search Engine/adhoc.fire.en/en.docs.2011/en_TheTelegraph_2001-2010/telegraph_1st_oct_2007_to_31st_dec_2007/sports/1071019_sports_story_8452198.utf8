 Federer cruises into quarters
 Roger Federer in action against Guillermo Canas in Madrid on Thursday. (AFP) Madrid: Holder Roger Federer crushed Argentine Guillermo Canas 6-0, 6-3 to take his place in the Madrid Masters quarter-finals on Thursday. The world No. 1 made a whirlwind start on the super-fast greenset surface at the Madrid Arena by rattling through the first set, leaving Canas totally bemused. The Argentine managed stiffer resistance in the second set but still could not cope with the technical brilliance of the 26-year-old Swiss, who will play either Stefan Koubek or Feliciano Lopez in the last eight. I took my chances and always felt in control. It was a good feeling out there, said Federer who had lost three of his four previous meetings with Canas. Earlier, third seed Novak Djokovic fended off a determined Juan Carlos Ferrero to makes the quarter-finals with a 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 win. Djokovic started sharply and took the first set with some ease. He steadied his own serve, stretched Djokovic around the court in the succeeding games and then broke again with some deft play at the net to take the set 6-2. Djokovic broke in the opening game of the decisive set when he forced Ferrero into an error at the net and held off the battling Spaniard to clinch the win. On Wednesday, Djokovic had to shake off a determined challenge from unseeded Fernando Verdasco to win 6-7, 6-3, 6-3, while Ferrero in the last 16 after the Spaniard got the better of compatriot Carlos Moya 7-6, 6-4. Also on Thursday, last years losing finalist Fernando Gonzalez breezed into the last eight with an emphatic 6-4, 6-2 victory over Argentine Juan Monaco. On Wednesday, world No. 2 Rafael Nadal recovered from an unsteady start to overpower Marcos Baghdatis 6-4, 6-4 and set up a mouth-watering last-16 clash against Andy Murray. Eight seeds including Masters Cup hopefuls Tommy Robredo, James Blake, David Ferrer, Ivan Ljubicic and Richard Gasquet tumbled out of the tournament on Wednesday. (Reuters)

London: Tottenham, Bordeaux, Bayer Leverkusen, Spartak Moscow and FC Zurich secured places in the next round of the UEFA Cup on Thursday. 
Tottenham drew 1-1 at Anderlecht to make sure it will be one of the three qualifiers from group G, while Bordeaux beat already qualified Helsingborg 2-1 to advance from group H. Group E was settled, aside from final position, in favour of Spartak Moscow, Leverkusen and Zurich, raising the number of qualified teams to 12 of 24. 
Bayer Leverkusen won 1-0 at Sparta Prague despite the 60th-minute sending off of Carsten Ramelow for violent conduct, and Spartak Moscow beat Zurich 1-0. 
Tottenham needed only a draw from a match played in constant driving rain before 24,000 fans at Vanden Stock Stadium, so coach Juande Ramos kept Berbatov on the bench until the 59th minute, when he replaced Robbie Keane. 
Anderlecht went ahead in the 68th when the Tottenham defence showed the weakness that has led to the clubs worst start to an English league season for 29 years. 
Cyril Thereau found space on the right and crossed into the centre, where two Spurs defenders failed to clear and Bart Goordrove the ball past goalkeeper Paul Robinson. But Anderlecht was caught off guard moments later and, when Jermaine Jenas broke through the centre, defender Jelle Van Damme brought him down from behind. After furious protests, Berbatov coolly sent keeper Daniel Zitka the wrong way while chipping the ball in the opposing corner. 
Five minutes from the end, Zitka needed to save a shot from substitute Jermain Defoe to safeguard the draw. While Spurs are finished with seven points from their four matches. 
Bordeaux have nine points, two more than Helsingborg and five more than Panionios, which won 1-0 at Austria through a goal by Daniel Majstorovic in injury time. 
Yegor Titov scored 12 minutes into the second half off a cross by Nikita Bazhenov for Spartak Moscows win over Zurich, 
Bolton beat Red Star Belgrade 1-0 while Aris drew 1-1 with visiting Braga, so that, with Panionios winning, Greece could still have four teams in the next round.

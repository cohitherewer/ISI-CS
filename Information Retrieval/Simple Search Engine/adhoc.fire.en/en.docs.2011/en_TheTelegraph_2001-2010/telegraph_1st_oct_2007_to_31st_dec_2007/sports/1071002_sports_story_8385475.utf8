 Yousuf pullout raises eyebrows
Karachi: Senior Pakistani batsman Mohammed Yousufs last-minute pullout from the first Test against South Africa here might be an attempt to escape legal hassles likely to crop up after he broke off with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) to make himself available for the national team. Chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said Yousuf cited lack of match fitness for his withdrawal and would be available for the second Test in Lahore from October 8. He opted out himself. He feels he needs more time to regain match fitness before playing again, Ahmed said. But there is a feeling that Yousufs pullout might have been prompted by a letter sent to him by the ICL asking him for an explanation for signing a central contract with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) while still being contracted to the ICL. Sources say the decision to not play Yousuf might have been taken on legal advice from the PCB lawyers as the next step expected from the ICL is a legal notice. The real reasons for the withdrawal are likely to be clear by the time the second Test starts. Last night, Yousuf received two cash prizes from the PCB. One for winning the ICC Test Player of the Year award and another for being in the category A of the central contracts, a total sum of $200,000 which is said to be the figure that he was to get for playing in the ICL in their first season.Yousuf, meanwhile, claimed he had informed the selectors beforehand about his non-availability for the match on Sunday night. I told them (the selectors) last night I was not playing, he said. It is just that I have not played any cricket for the last two months and have not been on the field. I was on a religious preaching tour to Dir last month. So I was not prepared for this match, he said. (PTI)

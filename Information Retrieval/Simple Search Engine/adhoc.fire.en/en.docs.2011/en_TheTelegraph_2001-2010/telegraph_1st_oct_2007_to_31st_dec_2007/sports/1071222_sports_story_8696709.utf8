 Mary Ann signs off in style

A CORRESPONDENT
 Mary Ann 
Calcutta: Mary Ann Gomes, who clinched her third and final WGM norm as well as the Asian Junior Girls meet title on Thursday, signed off on a winning note. 
Her convincing final round win over Kruttika Nadig in Mumbai on Friday meant that the defending champion finished with a tally of 8.5 points. 
The 18-year-old Calcuttan was issued a certificate for crossing the 2300 Elo rating by chief arbiter R. Anantaram. The WGM title is now a formality and will be ratified by the Fide in its next list. 
Mary Ann was unfortunate not to get an IM norm as well. Her final score was sufficient to fetch her one, but the walkover in the first round spoilt her chance. 
While most expected her to settle for a quick draw in the final round, Mary Ann decided to go all out with black. 
P. Karthikeyan emerged the surprise winner in the Asian Junior (open) section with seven points. Aswin Jayaram also tallied seven, but was second on tie-break.

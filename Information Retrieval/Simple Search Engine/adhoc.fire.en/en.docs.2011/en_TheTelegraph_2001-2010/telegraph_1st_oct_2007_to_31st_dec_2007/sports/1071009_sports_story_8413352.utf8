 Tiwary, Munaf help Rest tighten noose
 Munaf Patel bagged 3/19 Rajkot: Riding a fiery bowling performance from their pace trio and a delectable Manoj Tiwary century, Rest of India tightened the noose around Mumbai, reducing them to 98 for six in their second innings of the Irani Cup match here on Monday. Mumbai, who conceded a 19-run first innings lead, were severely rattled by pacemen Munaf Patel, Ranadeb Bose and Ishant Sharma on Day III. The Ranji champions are now 79 runs in front with four wickets in hand. Munaf struck twice in his third over to remove Prashant Naik (13) and first innings centurion Abhishek Nair (8). Munaf, who was struggling to get his rhythm in the first innings and went wicketless, was the pick of the bowlers for Rest of India in the second edition, bagging three wickets and conceding 19 runs in six overs. Ranadeb and Ishant took a wicket each for 42 and 29 runs, respectively. Wasim Jaffer (21) and Ajit Agarkar (7) were at the crease when stumps were drawn. Resuming at their overnight 292 for four, Rest of India managed to take a slender lead over Mumbai. Parthiv Patel added another 18 runs to his tally. He made 179 off 225 balls with 27 boundaries. However, Tiwarys composed knock of 130 helped Rest of India get past Mumbais first innings score of 453. Tiwary spent 274 minutes at the crease and faced 184 balls, cracking 12 fours and five sixes. He got useful support from Munaf (31) and Ranadeb (19). For Mumbai, mediumpacer Rajesh Verma captured five for 97.  (PTI)

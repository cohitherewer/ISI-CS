 DAY II HIGHLIGHTS

Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly during their 65-run partnership went past their 2500 runs aggregate for the 4th wicket. 
 Tendulkar hit his 48th Test fifty, eighth against Australia, fourth in Australia, second at the MCG and sixth in 2007. 
 Tendulkar is now on par with Brian Lara who also has 48 fifties. Only Border (63), Steve Waugh (50) Rahul Dravid (49) have more fifties than Lara and Tendulkar. 
 Adam Gilchrist took his 50th catch against India in Tests when the wicketkeeper caught Yuvraj Singh. Gilchrist has taken 15 matches to achieve this milestone. The only other wicketkeepers to reach the milestone vs India are Wasim Bari (50 cts, 18 Tests) and P.L. Dujon (58 cts, 19 Tests). 
 Later when he held Zaheer, Gilchrist equalled the tally of fellow Australian Ian Healy. Now both he and Healy have 395 dismissals each. Only South African Mark Boucher with over 400 dismissals has more dismissals in Test cricket. 
 Brett Lee (251 wickets) became the sixth Australian to take 250 Test wickets when he scalped Anil Kumble. He becomes the 28th bowler overall to do so.

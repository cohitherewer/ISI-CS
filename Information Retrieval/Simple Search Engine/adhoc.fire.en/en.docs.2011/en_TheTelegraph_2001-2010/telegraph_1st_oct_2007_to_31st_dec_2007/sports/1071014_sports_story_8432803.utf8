 Dont write off Dravid: Ponting
OUR CORRESPONDENTNagpur: Rahul Dravid, who has struggled to be among runs in this series, found support from Ricky Ponting on Saturday. Its not that he has been throwing his wicket away Rather he has fallen prey to good balls. Hes a class batsman and such players dont stay away from scoring too long, the Australian captain told a media conference. The former India captain has hardly been at the crease to judge what kind of form he is in. After having stepped down from the captaincy, he has only 44 runs in four innings. It would be cruel to rest or drop someone like him who has served the teams cause so efficiently over the past decade. On Sunday, Nagpur ka jamai will get another opportunity to stamp his class. The VCA Stadium hasnt been unkind to him and could be the perfect place to mark his return to form. Though Mahendra Singh Dhoni didnt wish to comment on Dravids form in Vadodara, he has found support within the team. It would be unfair to judge someone on the basis of the last few innings. Remember, he has over 10,000 runs in one-day cricket May be he lacks the consistency but it is only a matter of time before he returns to form, said a senior Team India player. Ponting, meanwhile, said racism was not acceptable in any form. Andrew Symonds was apparently made the target of money like noises when fielding in the deep during the Vadodara ODI. Racism is unacceptable anywhere in the world. You dont expect it to happen when you step out to play. He (Symonds) did not deserve it and you dont expect it to happen. I know the Match Referee knows about it. He has got the chance to write about what happened on the match day. If the ICC gets it in the report they have got something to do about it. Symonds was upset, but hes okay about it at the moment, Ponting said.

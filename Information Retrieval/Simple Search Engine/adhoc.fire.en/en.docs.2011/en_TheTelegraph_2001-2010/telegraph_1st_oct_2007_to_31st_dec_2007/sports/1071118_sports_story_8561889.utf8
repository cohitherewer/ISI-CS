 Paes, Damm bow out
Shanghai: Leander Paes and his Czech Republic partner Martin Damm went out of the season-ending tennis Masters Cup after going down in the semi finals to third seeds Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Austrias Julian Knowle in straight sets here on Saturday. The Indo-Czech pair, seeded fourth in the event, were beaten 4-6, 4-6 as Aspelin and Knowle advanced to a title showdown with top seeds Mark Knowles of Bahamas and Canadian Daniel Nestor. Knowles and Nestor beat second seeds Paul Hanley of Australia and Zimbabwean Kevin Ullyet 6-3, 6-7(8), 10-5 to make it to Sundays final at the Qi Zhong Stadium. This was Paes and Damms last tournament as a pair. The Indian ace will play with Australian Paul Hanley next year after the Czech decided to cut down on his Tour appearances. (PTI)

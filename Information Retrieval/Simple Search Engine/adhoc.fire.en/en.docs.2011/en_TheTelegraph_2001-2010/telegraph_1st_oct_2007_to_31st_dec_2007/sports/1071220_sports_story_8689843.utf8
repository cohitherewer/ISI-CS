 Carragher unmoved by Capello wish

 Fabio Capello 
Fabio Capello suffered the first setback of his reign as England manager on Tuesday when Liverpools Jamie Carragher insisted he would not come out of international retirement. 
Named as Steve McClarens successor last Friday, Capello has already talked of his desire for Carragher to rescind his decision to step down from the international arena. Carraghers performances in the Champions League, particularly against Capellos old Juventus side, had impressed the new England manager. 
But Carragher wants to concentrate on Liverpool and will refuse any plea from Capello to return for England. I dont think so, said Carragher. I am happy with the way things are now and I get to have a break with the family as well. I cannot see that changing. 
Asked if Capello travelling to the North-West and knocking on his door would influence matters, Carragher responded: I dont think so. 
Carragher had grown frustrated at being shifted around Englands back-line by Sven-Goran Eriksson, who used him at left-back and also as a holding midfielder. Capello, who sees his England spine involving John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney, wanted to add Carragher to his central-defensive options. 
Italys World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi, meanwhile, believes that Capello may have to axe an important player for the overall good of the England team. 
Lippi, who was among the candidates considered for the England job, was not afraid to drop star players during his successful reign with the Italian national team and predicted that his compatriot would also face difficult decisions. 
Capellos most difficult task will be to make a team become a team, something which in recent years it hasnt felt like, he said. That will be the most difficult challenge. The national team is not the selection of the best players of the country, but in order to make a team you may also need to have to drop an important player that perhaps is not on the same wavelength as the others. 
Capello plans to study English intensively over the next month and Lippi agrees that mastering the language will be fundamental to his success. 
I have always said that a coach must transmit to his players everything that goes through his heart and head and in order to do so, he cant be talking and then asking the interpreter to translate, its impossible, he said. The fact that I dont speak English is one of the reasons why I have turned down three or four proposals that have arrived from the English Premiership.

 Indian trio tied 10th
 ChowrasiaHanoi: The Indian trio of Rahil Gangjee, S.S.P. Chowrasia and Gurbaaz Mann turned in identical opening round cards of three-under 69 to share the 10th spot in the inaugural Hana Bank Vietnam Masters at the Hanoi Phoenix Golf Resort here on Thursday. Playing his back nine first, Chowrasia returned a blemish-free card and birdied the 12th, 15th and 17th holes to round off his satisfying day. Fellow Calcutta pro Gangjee bogeyed the third, 10th and 14th holes but birdies on the first, second, eighth and 12th and the eagle on the par-four fifth hole put him back on track. Mann mixed four birdies and a bogey in his round.  (PTI)

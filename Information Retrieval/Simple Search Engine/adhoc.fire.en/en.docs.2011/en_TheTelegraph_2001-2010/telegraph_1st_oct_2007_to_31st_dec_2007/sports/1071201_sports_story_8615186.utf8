 The accumulator makes a point
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Rahul Dravid on way to his 50 at the Eden on Friday Calcutta: Points were scored on and off the field during Day I of the latest Test at the Eden. The biggest, clearly, was made by low profile opener Wasim Jaffer. Seen as an accumulator from the Sunil Gavaskar school, the Mumbaikar remained unbeaten on 192  the third highest score by an Indian on any day of a Test. Only Virender Sehwag (twice) has done better. Jaffer himself acknowledged Ive never batted so fluently in my Test career His third fifty (100-150) was the quickest both in terms of time consumed (no more than 80 minutes) and balls taken (just 57). Quite a revelation. It was an innings, a feature of which was flawless timing, that invited all-round appreciation. Pakistans chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed, for example, told The Telegraph: A wonderful knock with great shots. Off the field, the applause which greeted former captain Rahul Dravid each time he got a boundary (seven in all) helped erase memories of the barracking hed been subjected to during the India-South Africa ODI two years ago. That, of course, had been because of Sourav Gangulys exclusion from Team India. The then coach, Greg Chappell, was also targeted that day and it didnt help that a camera caught him making an objectionable gesture outside the Eden. One expects the crowd here to break into a frenzied Dada, Dada roar each time Sourav prepares to take guard, but back in November 2005, few wouldve believed that Dravid would actually be cheered on Souravs home turf. The ODI against Sri Lanka in February hardly saw action and, so, Day I of this penultimate Test versus Pakistan was the locals first real exposure to Dravid since that ODI against South Africa. Shoaib Akhtar also tried to score a point by making himself available for selection, but drew a blank as he couldnt bowl more than nine overs. That too, believe it or not, in four spells! The visitors may have wanted to make a psychological point  Shoaib, after all, made a huge impact during the Asian Test Championship face-off here in early 1999  but ended up getting scalded. Signing off, one couldnt really understand the point made by Sohail Tanveer (and stand-in captain Younis Khan) when he sent down a few overs of left-arm spin. Bowling quick is at the top of Tanveers CV, followed by his ability to make decent contributions with the bat.

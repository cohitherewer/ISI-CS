 Bagan look to seal title today
A STAFF REPORTER Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira keeps a watch on captain Bhaichung Bhutia and his teammates during practice at the club ground on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Mohun Bagan need just a win over Peerless SC on Wednesday to pocket the CFL Premier Division 2007 title. If coach Carlos Perreira is to be believed, the green-and-maroons will not do anything foolish, but to go for a safe 1-0 win. We need a 1-0 win tomorrow and we will go only for that, Perreira said after Tuesdays practice. Before their penultimate match, Mohun Bagan face with injury problems in their defence. N.S. Manju has a groin injury while Sanjeev Maria is down with fever. In their absence, Douglas da Silva will play as a central defender alongside Peter Siddiqui. Also to get an early lead, Perreira may field Bhaichung Bhutia, Jose Barreto and P.C. Lalawmpuia in a three-pronged attack. Barreto may play from a bit deep with Bhaichung and Lalawmpuia up front, the coach said. Mohun Bagan are on 30 points from 12 outings while closest to their heels are East Bengal with 25. Both teams are to play two more matches. We have to finish the league tomorrow only As we dont want to take any chanced in our last match against Mohammedan Sporting, the Brazilian added. Having performed well this season, Barreto is just excited. I am happy with the way Ive played Having beaten East Bengal twice, win in this league would be more satisfying, Barreto said.

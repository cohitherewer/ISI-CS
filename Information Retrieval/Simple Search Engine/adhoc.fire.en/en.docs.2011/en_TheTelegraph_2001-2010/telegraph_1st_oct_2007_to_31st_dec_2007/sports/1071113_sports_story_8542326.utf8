 AIFF to hike Pro League prize money
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Monday gave major clubs a reason to smile when it assured them of enhancing the prize money for the inaugural Professional League beginning on November 24. The league, to be sponsored by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), is likely to be known as I-League. Since the inaugural edition of the National Football League (NFL) in 1996, the winners have pocketed Rs 40 lakh while the runners-up have settled for Rs 22 lakh. According to sources, there is a possibility of the AIFF hiking the prize money to Rs 50 lakh for the winners. A final decision will only be taken in the executive committee meeting in Delhi on Friday. The prize money will definitely be increased, a club official said after the culmination of a day long seminar on the Pro League for participating clubs and State associations, at Goa. The clubs were also informed that a direct red card in an NFL tie that normally results in the offender being banned for two matches will now invite only one match suspension. National coach Bob Houghton said there should be a minimum of 14 teams in the Professional League and it should be over between 32 and 40 weeks. Pro League teams, Houghton said, should stay away from local leagues and instead field reserve sides, under-21 or youth teams.

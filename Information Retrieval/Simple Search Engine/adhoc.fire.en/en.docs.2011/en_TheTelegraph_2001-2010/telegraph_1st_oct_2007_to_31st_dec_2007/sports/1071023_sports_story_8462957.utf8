 Dida ban reduced to 1 game
Milan: AC Milan goalkeeper Didas two-match Champions League ban for feigning injury against Celtic was reduced to one game on Monday. The Brazilian will miss Wednesdays home fixture with Shakhtar Donetsk, with the second match suspended for a one-year probationary period, Uefa said on its website. Dida fell dramatically to the ground after chasing a Celtic fan, who had run on to the pitch to celebrate his teams late winner in a 2-1 victory on October 3 and appeared to make light contact as he slapped the Brazilian round the neck. Uefas disciplinary committee banned Dida for two games and fined Celtic 60,000 Swiss francs ($57,000), half of which will be suspended for two years, for failing to keep the fan off the pitch. European champions Milan immediately indicated they would appeal, saying the ban was excessive and the real villain was the fan. Uefas appeals commission decided on Monday to halve Didas suspension based on a paragraph in the regulations of European soccers governing body stating players, officials and members shall conduct themselves according to the principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship. Dida stood in the centre circle and bowed to each corner of the ground before Sundays 0-1 defeat by Empoli to say sorry for the incident, Milans first home game since the defeat at Celtic. The Celtic supporter, who identified himself to police the day after the match, was given a lifetime ban by the Scottish champions.  (REUTERS)

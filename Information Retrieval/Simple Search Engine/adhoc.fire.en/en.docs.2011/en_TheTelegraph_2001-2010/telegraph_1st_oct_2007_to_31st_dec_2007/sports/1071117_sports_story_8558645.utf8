 BCCI wants explanation from Vengsarkar
Mumbai: The BCCI on Friday sought an explanation from chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar for continuing to write newspaper columns defying the gag order. We have asked for an explanation from him. Thats all. We cant monitor each and every paper in the country (whether Vengsarkars columns appear or not), BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said from Rajkot. Vengsarkar is continuing to write his columns in some vernacular newspapers, notably a Marathi daily which is owned by BCCI chief Sharad Pawars brother. Asked whether the ban on his columns applied only to English newspapers, Shah said: He has been told not to write his columns and it applies to all the languages, thats it. Vengsarkar was barred by BCCI office-bearers from addressing the customary media conference after the Test squad against Pakistan was selected in Mumbai on Wednesday. We dont have to tell the media why we have taken this decision, Shah had said after that meeting.  (AGENCIES)

 Security fears over 2010 Cup
DAVID BOND IN DURBANFears over security overshadowed the draw for the 2010 World Cup on Sunday after it emerged that a former Austrian goalkeeper, a close friend of Franz Beckenbauer, had been shot dead on a golf course near Durban. Although the Fifa president Sepp Blatter dismissed any direct link to the draw for the tournament  the first big test for South Africa in the countdown to 2010  news that Pieter Burgstaller had been murdered sparked fresh concerns over the countrys deadly crime rate. Austrian and German Football Federation officials confirmed that the 43-year-old events manager was on holiday in South Africa, but had been invited to attend Sundays draw by Beckenbauer, who is a Fifa vice-president. Burgstaller was found shot dead with a single bullet wound to the chest on Friday evening on the 12th tee of a golf course at the exclusive Selborne Hotel, Spa and Golf Estate in Pennington, an hours drive from Durban. Police believe the motive was robbery. Burgstaller used to play in goal for SV Salzburgan. Fifa and South African organisers tried to play down the shooting. Blatter said: To make parallels between Fifas presence here and this death is a combination that does not reflect the actuality. We deplore that a tourist from Austria was shot dead on a golf course. We deplore that as we would deplore all death or casualties in any country. This tourist was not a member of the delegation coming for the draw  The Daily Telegraph

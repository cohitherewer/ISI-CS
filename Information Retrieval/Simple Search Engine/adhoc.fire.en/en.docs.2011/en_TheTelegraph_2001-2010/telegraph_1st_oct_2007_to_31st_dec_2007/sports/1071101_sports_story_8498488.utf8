 Camp unlikely to be shifted
A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Team Indias conditioning camp is unlikely to be shifted from Calcutta even if the squally weather continues on Thursday. The two-day camp, prior to the ODI series against Pakistan, is scheduled to be held at the Eden on Friday and Saturday. Wednesdays unseasonal showers raised the obvious question whether the Eden will be ready by Friday afternoon for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. to practise. But the CAB was hardly concerned. Samar Pal, one of the joint secretaries, said in the evening that there was very little chance of the camp being held anywhere else as time was at a premium. Well have a look at the wicket tomorrow (Thursday) morning and see how things are There shouldnt be any problem if there isnt further rain, said Pal. The forecast, though, isnt too encouraging . If the pitch is not ready, the players will work out at the Pankaj Gupta Indoor Training Centre, said Pal. Pal said he will get in touch with BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah on Thursday after inspecting the Eden. Shah, asked if there was any chance of the camp being shifted, played it safe. Lets see how it goes Shah had no idea whether Virender Sehwag  who lost his father on Tuesday  would attend the camp. He hasnt informed us anything yet, so we presume he will be there, said the secretary. Till late on Wednesday, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar also had no information on Sehwag  whether he would join the camp and be available for the first two ODIs.

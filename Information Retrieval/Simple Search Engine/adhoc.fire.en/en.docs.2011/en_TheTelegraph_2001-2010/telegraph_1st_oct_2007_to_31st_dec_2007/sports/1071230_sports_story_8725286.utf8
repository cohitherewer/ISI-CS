 Wish I knew what went wrong, says Kumble

 - Team India to have a day off despite losing in under four days 
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
Melbourne: Its hardly well earned, but The Telegraph learns that the Anil Kumbles will have a day off on Sunday, the scheduled last day of the opening Test which finished in under four days (on Saturday). 
Captain Kumble, however, seemed to have been affected by the crushing defeat. The pain and disappointment came through during his session with the media. 
The following are excerpts 
On what went wrong 
Wish I knew what went wrong... Our batting didnt stand up... It was important to hang in there... We started losing wickets after lunch and... It wasnt an easy wicket to bat on, but you could still settle down. 
On what needs to be done 
The mental make-up of the batsmen needs to change... Its not that they dont have the skills to counter Australia... 
On the only warm-up game being hit by rain 
One isnt enough because, whatever the conditions, one requires time to acclimatise... Having said that, we had our moments but didnt capitalise, particularly after taking nine wickets in two sessions on the first day. 
On the awful run-rate 
I agree that it needs to be healthy and weve got to be positive... It was a matter of just one batsman getting a big score... Well be positive going forward... The batsmen didnt bat freely and theyre a finicky lot... Bowlers can adjust quickly, not so the batsmen. 
On whether the batsmen felt intimidated 
Never thought so... Theyve got to be relaxed and positive... The bowlers showed they could bowl Australia out, now its a question of the batsmen getting runs. Id been confident that our batsmen would at least get close to the Australian first innings total (343), even if we didnt take a lead... 
On the move to promote Rahul Dravid to the second openers slot 
It was the right decision... Going by form and the team dynamics, it was the best combination... It was tricky, but I didnt have a choice as the specialist openers who didnt play (Virender Sehwag and Dinesh Karthik) hadnt been among runs (before the tour)... If Yuvraj Singh hadnt been played, you would have asked why not? Ifs and buts will always be there. 
On Yuvraj being one of the big failures (0, 5) 
Im not going to blame one batsman... That wont be fair because the failure was collective. 
On whether Dravids failures (5, 16) have left him worried 
Hes too good a player to worry over his batting... Hes got over 9,000 runs and has over 100 Test appearances... 
On where he would rate the batting failures in both innings 
I dont sit and rate... But, yes, its very disappointing and the team needs to be more hungry for success. The defeat hurts and not just individually. 
On what had been the game plan for Saturday 
We wanted to take it session by session... It wasnt easy to score, but it wasnt difficult to put ones head down... Australia need to be given credit for the way they bowled. 
On too much respect having been given to Brad Hogg 
He bowled well... The situations werent there to go after him. 
Finally, on the poor ground fielding 
Some of us, including myself, are on the other side of 35 and its difficult to make adjustments... Some things cant change... In any case, you dont win by fielding alone... But, yes, one needs to have a high degree of intensity.

 Roger Federer tops chart again 
 Roger Federer after winning the title in Basel on Sunday. (Reuters) Basel: Roger Federer won his seventh tournament of the season on Sunday, beating unseeded Finn Jarkko Nieminen 6-3, 6-4 to successfully defend his hometown title in Basel. Federers latest victory guarantees that the Swiss will finish the season as world No. 1 for a fourth consecutive year. Federer had not dropped a set in any of his previous seven meetings with the world No. 29 and the Swiss Indoors final proved predictably straightforward. Its been a fantastic week, having the support of my home crowd behind me all the way, said Federer after receiving a standing ovation at the tournament where he once worked as a ballboy. Securing the No. 1 ranking for the year and doing it here is particularly special. In a way its a shame for the fans when the match only lasts for an hour now its no longer a best-of-five final, especially after they have travelled from all over the country and even down from the mountains. But I think they were all wanting me to win so hopefully I sent them home happy. A single break of the Finns serve at the start of the opening set put Federer comfortably on his way to winning his 52nd career title and his third on home soil  following last years Swiss Indoors title and his 2004 triumph in Gstaad. Nieminen started to find his rhythm in the second set, securing a break point in Federers first service game but failing to convert it. The left-hander then won two service games to love, a feat that Federer failed to pull off throughout the match. But any hopes that Nieminen might make things difficult for the world No. 1 faded when he next came to serve, double-faulting to hand Federer a further break point before hitting a forehand wide. I was trying a little too much in the beginning and falling 3-0 behind is obviously not the best way to start against Federer, said the Finn after missing out on what would have been his second career title.

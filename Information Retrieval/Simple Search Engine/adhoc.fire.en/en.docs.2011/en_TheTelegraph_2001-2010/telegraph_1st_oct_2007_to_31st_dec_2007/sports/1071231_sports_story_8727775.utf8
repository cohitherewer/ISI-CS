 Hi-Fliers, Dynamos in semis

Chandigarh: Former champions Bangalore Hi-Fliers edged past Sher-e-Jallandhar 2-1 to sail into the semi finals of the 4th Premier Hockey League at the Sector 42 Hockey Stadium on Sunday. 
In another match, local favourites Chandigarh Dynamos, riding on Sher Singhs 26th minute goal, scraped past Maratha Warriors 1-0 to book their berth in the semi finals. 
While, Hi-Fliers completed their engagements in the league winning five of the six matches and currently top the table with 14 points, Dynamos, with a match in hand against Chennai Veerans, have 12 points from equal number of games. 
Maratha Warriors are on seven beating Hyderabad Sultans and Shers remained on five. 
After a barren first half, Hi-Fliers drew the first blood converting their third penalty corner in the 47th minute. Twenty minutes later, they increased the lead with a superb field goal by Hyo-Sik. Shers pulled one back in the 69th minute when Gurvinder Singh deflected home off a long diagonal cross into the circle from the left. (PTI)

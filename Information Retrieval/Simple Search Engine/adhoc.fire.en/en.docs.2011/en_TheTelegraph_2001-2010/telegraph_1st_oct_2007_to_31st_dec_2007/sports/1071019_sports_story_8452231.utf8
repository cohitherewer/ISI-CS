 Becker daughter in child labour row
Berlin: A cosmetics company that used the seven-year-old daughter of German tennis star Boris Becker in an advertising promotion has been fined for exploiting child labour, reports said on Thursday. Anna Ermakowa appeared for the Alessandro cosmetics firm at a trade fair in Duesseldorf in March, promoting nail varnish for girls aged five and upwards, newspapers reported. But the industrial safety office in Duesseldorf fined the company euro 1,316 ($1,880) because it had broken rules concerning the work of children by failing to seek prior approval from the authorities. Anna was conceived in a brief moment of passion between Becker and model Angela Ermakowa in a cupboard at a London restaurant in 1999. A three-time Wimbledon champion, Becker is no longer with Annas mother. He said recently that he did not approve of using his daughter for fashion modelling or advertising. If it was up to me, Anna wouldnt do those things, he said. (AFP)

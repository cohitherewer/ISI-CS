 Inzy stand at the Gaddafi
 Inzamam-ul Haq walks back after being dismissed for 14 on Wednesday Lahore: A stand at the Gaddafi Stadium will be named after Inzamam-ul Haq. The PCB is also planning a rousing farewell for Inzamam, who has announced that he will retire at the end of the ongoing second and final Test against South Africa. Former Test players have been invited to the function to be held on the final day of the Test. A special gold medal will be presented to Inzamam. According to an unconfirmed report, the PCB  which has already dedicated the match as the Inzamam Test  will also hand over a cheque for rupees 1 million. We are trying our best to give Inzamam a befitting farewell and hope to have a big crowd for the occasion. He has given great service to Pakistan cricket, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said. Inzamams 120th and final Test has not gone well for him and the team so far. He was dismissed for 14 in the first innings as South Africa took a 151-run lead. Overall, the visitors are 305 runs ahead with eight wickets in hand and two days remaining. Inzamam needs six runs in his last Test innings to displace Javed Miandad as Pakistans highest run scorer in Tests.  (PTI)

 Leg-spinner ready for mantle
New Delhi: Veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumble on Wednesday threw his hat in the ring and announced that he is ready to take over as Indias Test captain if the selectors ask him to do so. The 37-year-old leg-spinner, a veteran of 118 Test and 271 one-day Internationals, said leading India would be an honour but it was up to the selectors to decide whom they want for the top job. I would certainly do the job if asked to. I dont know what the big deal is Why so much is being made of this. I have said this before also, Kumble told a website on Wednesday. Since predecessor Rahul Dravid quit the job after leading India to a successful tour of England, India are without a Test captain and with Sachin Tendulkar  selectors first choice for the job  pulling out of the race, one day and Twenty20 International captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni seems the obvious candidate. The senior pro said he had no idea if his name would be discussed at all or not but the ball was now in the selectors court. I dont know whether Im in the race, but if its offered it would be a great honour, said Kumble, who many felt could have been a good captain because of his cerebral approach to the game. I have relished it whenever I had the opportunity. But thats not something for me to decide, Kumble added. Incidentally, cricketer-turned-commentator Sanjay Manjrekar has also advocated having Kumble as the captain of the Test team.  (PTI)

 Brazil off to a dull start
Bogota: Brazil struggled to an uninspiring goalless draw away to Colombia in their opening match of the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign on Sunday. The only team to have played at all 18 World Cups, Brazil are likely to be happier with the point, achieved at 2,600m above sea level on a slippery pitch, than their lacklustre performance. Despite making wholesale changes from their Copa America squad and fielding an inexperienced team, Colombia had most of the pressure and Brazil became less adventurous as the game went on. Considering that we were playing away from home, at high altitude, on a heavy pitch, it was a reasonable start to the qualifiers, Brazil coach Dunga said. The first half was evenly balanced and we had a few chances. In the second half, we lacked speed and strength and the players felt tired. If Colombia play like they did against Brazil, they will qualify, Dunga added. Brazil forward Ronaldinho was also satisfied. With the pitch and the altitude, it was a good point because I dont think many other teams will come here and get a point, he said. The match kicked off 45 minutes late after a torrential downpour left puddles on the pitch but the water drained away quickly. Backed by a passionate crowd at the El Campin stadium, Colombia took the game to Brazil and Radamel Falcao Garcia was close after a well-worked move from a free-kick in the third minute. Colombia striker Wason Renteria twice forced Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar to make difficult saves from headers and the visitors were so uncomfortable that Julio Cesar was booked for time-wasting in the 44th minute. Brazils best first-half effort came when Ronaldinho had a shot from a narrow angle turned around the post by Agustin Julio. Colombia continued to press forward after halftime and Julio Cesar was forced to parry a long-range shot from substitute Freddy Grisales. Aldo Leao Ramirez also tested the goalkeeper with a low shot but Colombia were unable to find their way past a packed Brazil defence. Midfielder Mineiro had Brazils only second-half scoring chance when his 25m drive was turned away by Julio. Brazil still have 17 matches to play in the World Cup qualifiers, a competition which takes two years to complete. The outcome was a 0-0 draw after a match in which Brazil gave away 23 free kicks and defended for much of the time with seven or eight men.  (REUTERS)

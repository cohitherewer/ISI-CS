A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Chirag United confirmed their status as the No. 1 challengers to the Big Two with a 4-0 rout of Mohammedan Sporting in the return leg of their Sahara CFL Premier Division match on Saturday. Biswajit Bhattacharyas side had beaten the black-and-whites 2-1 in the first leg. Shabbir Alis team had to incur the wrath of fans who had gathered in the hopes that their side would avenge the first-leg loss. They also booed the coach and demanded his resignation. The win, despite the scoreline, was no cakewalk. Chirag United had a fight on their hands in the first half before Theodore capitalised on a Sankar Oraon pass to give them the lead in injury time. In fact, Theodore was the hero of the match, later scoring one more by converting a penalty. The 1-0 lead was enough to put Mohammedan Sporting on the back foot as the home team conceded another in the fourth minute of the second half. Taking advantage of Sheikh Nasibul Haques misjudgement, N.R. Dhanranjan banged in a long volley. In the 32nd minute of the second half Gouranga Dutta added to Mohammedan Sportings misery, deceiving substitute Sheikh Azim to net the third goal from the left half. Five minutes before the final whistle, Theodore sealed the rout. Mohamemdan Sporting got a chance to pull one back in the last minute thorough a penalty but K. Kulothungan squandered the chance. Chirag Uniteds tally now stands at 19 points from 12 matches. Mohammedan Sporting have 13 points, also from 12 matches. TEAMS United SC: Shibram Dey, Dulal Biswas, Barun Oraon, Louis Nigiebami, N.R.

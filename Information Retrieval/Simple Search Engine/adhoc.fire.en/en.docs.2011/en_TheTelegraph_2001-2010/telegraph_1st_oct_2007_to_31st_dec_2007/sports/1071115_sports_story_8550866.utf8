 BCCI draws a cover on transparency
Mumbai: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar has been gagged by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) which has asked him not to interact with the media. Vengsarkar was earlier banned from writing syndicated columns. The decision not to allow the selection committee chairman to speak to the media after the meetings was taken at the office bearers sitting (of the BCCI in Delhi) on Tuesday, board secretary Niranjan Shah said. The selectors on Wednesday provided only a media release of the first Two Test squad against Pakistan, instead of the normal conference addressed by Vengsarkar. From now on there will only be media releases after a selection committee meeting and there wont be any interaction (between the chief selector and media), said another board source. We have reverted back to the days when Chandu Borde and Syed Kirmani were chairmen, if you remember, he added, referring to Bordes second innings as chairman between 1999-2002 and Kirmanis term in 2003-04.

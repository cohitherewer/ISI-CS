 Sohail hails Sourav
INDRANIL MAJUMDAR Aamer Sohail Gwalior: A hundred wickets in one-day Internationals was not something Sourav Ganguly had bargained for. It wasnt something he had set out to achieve at the start of this series. Its been more of a bonus. The former India captain is more focused on realising his dream of playing a hundred Tests. His current tally stands at 96. Only three players have thus far achieved the feat of 10,000 runs and 100 wickets  Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya being the other two. Former Pakistan captain Aamer Sohail feels Sourav deserves the honour. He has always been a class player in this form of the game. This was always on the cards He deserves every inch of this honour, Sohail told The Telegraph on Thursday. Theres no doubt that of late the former India captain has been under tremendous pressure to retain his place in the side. The need to infuse young blood has attained much importance keeping in mind the 2011 World Cup. Sohail, who has 4780 runs and 85 wickets in 156 one-dayers, feels such drastic measures need not be taken in a hurry as Sourav still has it in him to succeed at the top level. If someone like Sourav has been producing the results whats the need? Grooming the youngsters doesnt mean dumping the seniors. The ICC World Twenty20 has proved that India has some promising youngsters waiting in the wings. If you are looking ahead then it can always be done after consultation with the concerned players. The national selectors and players should realise what is good for the country. The selectors should make their viewpoint known to the players in a proper fashion. Once they sit down and sort it out any decision will be easy. No one will object and controversies can be avoided, he explained. FOURTH ODI HIGHLIGHTSSourav Ganguly took his 100th wicket, 15 years after he made his ODI debut on January 11, 1992. The former India captain took 311 matches to reach the landmark. Souravs 99th victim was Ian Bell at Headingley on September 2, 2007 Younis Khan scored his 29th half-century and fourth against India Mohammed Yousuf scored his 59th half-century and his ninth versus India. It was also his seventh 50-plus score on Indian soil. Yousuf became the eighth cricketer to remain 99 not out at the end of the innings. The others are: B. A.

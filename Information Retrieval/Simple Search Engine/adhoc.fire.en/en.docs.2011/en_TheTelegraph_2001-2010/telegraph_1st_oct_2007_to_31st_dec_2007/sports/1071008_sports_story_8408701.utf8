 Hair tribunal highlights flaws in ICC: Atherton
A STAFF REPORTER Darrell Hair Calcutta: The ongoing legal battle between Darrell Hair and the ICC has brutally exposed the lack of leadership dogging the games world governing body, feels Michael Atherton. In his column in The Sunday Telegraph, the former England captain said if the ICC experiences one more day as they did on Friday, then the Great Darrell Hair Fightback is not too far away. A farce whose origins sprang, as the ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said at the time  from a series of entirely avoidable over-reactions  has finally reached its conclusion just over a year later at the Central London Employment Tribunal. And if the ICC have many more disastrous days, such as they endured on Friday  the start of, in David Cameron-speak, The Great Darrell Hair Fightback  it may be a seminal moment for the future of the administration of the game, felt Atherton. Delving into minute details of what passed in the courtroom between Hairs lawyer Robert Griffiths QC and the three ICC directors, Atherton said only Inderjit Singh Bindra survived the fierce cross-examination without cutting a sorry figure. On Friday, it was the turn of three of the ICC directors  Sir John Anderson (New Zealand), Inderjit Singh Bindra (India) and Ray Mali (then the South African director, now the president)  to face cross-examination by Griffiths. Only Bindra retained any sense of clarity of thought, sticking resolutely to his line that the game had to go on! and no man is bigger than the game! By then it was too late; the damage had been done. What a time of it Griffiths had! Turning to the gallery with a malevolent grin every time a point was scored, he revealed completely the vacuum of leadership at the heart of the organisation that purports to run the game, wrote Atherton. Atherton stressed that he has little sympathy for Hair during the Oval fiasco, but the way the tribunal went, Hair suddenly emerged as one who has been wronged. I had little sympathy for Hair during the events of the Oval, but I rather hope the tribunal chairman (this whole process has an Orwellian ring to it) finds a way of recognising that Hair has been treated appallingly since then, while throwing out the racism claims. Instinctively I find myself sympathising with the individual and the powerless over the corporate and the powerful. This is not about what happened at the Oval, but what has happened since. There is no doubt that Hair has been treated poorly. Beyond these narrow confines, perhaps the lasting effects of this case will be the governance of the ICC. It was clear on Friday that decision-making should be left to the professionals, to the paid executives, rather than to the well-meaning amateurs. Nothing summed this up more than the cross-examination of Mali. He was asked what the primary role of an umpire was, to which he replied that an umpire has certain responsibilities inside the boundary rope and certain responsibilities outside it. Would he like to elaborate? For an instant, Mali looked like he had been asked to describe the internal workings of his wrist watch. Then he declined to say anything further, except that he felt Hair could resume his responsibilities as an elite umpire in the future. At that point every man jack in the room, possibly even Robert Griffiths QC, wondered what the hell they were doing there.

 Bharat Arun wants two-week camp

A STAFF REPORTER
Calcutta: Bengal coach Bharat Arun wants a two-week camp before the National one-dayers. The camp is likely to be held in the third week of January. The coach will also watch the League matches before deciding on the players. 
Bengal had a disastrous Ranji campaign this season and were demoted from Super League to Plate. 
It will be a different ball game in the one-dayers and there is no reason why we cannot do well, a senior CAB official said on Saturday. 
Arun will also have to face the panel comprising three former Bengal captains Gopal Bose, Sambaran Banerjee and Utpal Chatterjee to explain the reasons behind the disaster. The coach left for Chennai on Saturday and will be back by January 6. 
Laxmi Ratan Shuklas captaincy is also under the scanner. He may still retain the post though Ranadeb Bose and Manoj Tiwary are also in the reckoning.

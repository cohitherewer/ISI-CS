 Becks to play in Spain again
Malaga: David Beckham will play in an anti-poverty charity match on November 19, his first game in Spain since leaving Real Madrid. He is on a list of players set to take part in the fifth game sponsored by the United Nations Development Program and its ambassadors, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo, a Spanish news agency reported on Monday. Zidane and AC Milan striker Ronaldo will each captain a team at the La Rosaleda stadium in Malaga. Milan defender Paolo Maldini and Brazilians Roberto Carlos, Cafu, Dida and Rivaldo are all set to play, while retired Italian referee Pierluigi Collina will participate for the fifth time. Beckham left Madrid in June after four years with the Spanish club to join Los Angeles Galaxy. Proceeds will benefit anti-poverty projects that range from support to female entrepreneurs to the construction of sports centres for street children in Asia, Africa and Latin America. (AP)

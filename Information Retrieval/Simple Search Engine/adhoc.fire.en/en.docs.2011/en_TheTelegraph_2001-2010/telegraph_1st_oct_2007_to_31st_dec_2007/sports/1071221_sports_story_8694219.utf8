 J amp;K satisfy AIFF team

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
New Delhi: The Santosh Trophy may be held in Jammu and Kashmir after 30 years, according to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources. 
A two-member AIFF team, which visited the northern Indian state recently to inspect the facilities and infrastructure in Srinagar and Jammu, has expressed satisfaction over the arrangements. 
The J amp;K Football Association has done a good job, said Subrata Dutta, AIFF vice president and a member of the inspection committee. In our opinion, they have the capacity to host the Santosh Trophy as scheduled in May, 2008. 
The state government, Dutta said, has assured full security for every participant during the National football championships. The entire J amp; K government, including the chief minister, is very keen to stage the championships in the state, Dutta said. 
The last time J amp;K hosted Santosh Trophy was in 1978-79 when Bengal defeated Goa in the final.

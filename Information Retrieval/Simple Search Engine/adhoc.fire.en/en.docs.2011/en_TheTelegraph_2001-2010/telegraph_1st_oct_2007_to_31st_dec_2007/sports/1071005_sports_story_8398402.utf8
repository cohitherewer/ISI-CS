 Selectors undecided
OUR CORRESPONDENTHyderabad: The national selectors are undecided on enforcing the rotation policy following Indias performance in the series. The five wise men, led by Dilip Vengsarkar, meet on Friday evening. The outcome of the match will decide whether they pick the squad for the remaining four matches or restrict their choice to the next two ODIs. The selectors are unwilling to rest the seniors if Australia take a 2-0 lead in the series. They may then have to wait for two more games before making a final decision.

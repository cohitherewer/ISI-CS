 Manchester United a victory from knockout stage
 - Champions League
 -  Barcelona counting on home advantage versus Glasgow Rangers  Wayne Rooney during practice at Manchester Uniteds Carrington training ground on Tuesday, the eve of their Champions League match against Dynamo Kiev. (AFP) London: Everything is coming together nicely for Manchester United and they could secure Champions League progress with two games to spare by beating Dynamo Kiev in group F on Wednesday. Kiev, without a win in 10 Champions League games over three years, have lost all three of the current campaign and look unlikely to ruffle the feathers of a United team who overwhelmed them 4-2 two weeks ago in Ukraine. That was a run of four successive wins where the Premier League champions scored four goals, a run brought to an end by Saturdays 2-2 draw at Arsenal. Even though the goals were a little harder to come by at the Emirates Stadium, manager Alex Ferguson came away with even more confidence about his strike force after a telling contribution from substitute Louis Saha. The French striker Saha appeared for the first time in a month and linked nicely with Patrice Evra to create Cristiano Ronaldos goal that had United 2-1 up until injury time. Louis Saha made a marvellous contribution when he came on, said Ferguson, who knows a win will be enough if Sporting Lisbon fail to beat AS Roma. Midfielder Michael Carrick also returned after a month, full back Gary Neville appeared for the reserves after a seven-month absence and, with Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez forging a great partnership up front, Ferguson has enviable options in all areas. I had the strongest bench that weve had all season, thats encouraging for us, he said after the Arsenal game. The lads who have been playing all this time have been fantastic and we are very proud of them. But we can now alternate our teams a little bit better. Victory on Wednesday should just about wrap up qualification for the knockout rounds and leave Ferguson to concentrate his efforts on domestic issues until the New Year. While it is all smiles at Old Trafford, Kiev have reached the halfway point of their league season under a cloud. A 0-1 home defeat by Metalist Kharkiv on Saturday left them third, 10 points behind leaders Shakhtar Donetsk and in danger of missing out on the Champions League next season. They also lost coach Jozef Sabo, appointed in place of Anatoliy Demyanenko after the 0-2 defeat to AS Roma in the opening game of the group stage. He has had to step down with a heart problem and will be temporarily replaced by his assistant Oleg Luzhniy. Brazilians Rodrigo and Kleber and Ukraine midfielder Mykhalyk are all injured, though forward Serhiy Rebrov has recovered from a knee problem and should play. With so many problems and disruptions, president Igor Surkis is already looking to next season. We cant wait for the winter break, said.We will make fundamental changes in the transfer market and add four or five young Ukrainian players to the squad. If we dont win a Champions League berth for next season I will not make a tragedy out of it. On the contrary, I see a positive side to that. It would give us a year to create a new team which could gain experience in the UEFA Cup. The great Bayern Munich have taken that path and were not ashamed to walk it as well. Barcelona, meanwhile, are counting on home advantage and the return to form of Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry to prise open a Rangers defence that has conceded just three goals in their last 10 European matches. With the two teams tied on seven points at the top of group E, a win for either side at the Nou Camp on Wednesday would take them to the brink of the last 16 with qualification certain if Olympique Lyon lose to Stuttgart. Barcelona were held to a 0-0 draw when the two teams met at Ibrox two weeks ago with the Rangers determined defence and an inspired display by keeper Allan McGregor frustrating the Catalans hopes of victory. The Glasgow side has fond memories of the Nou Camp having won the Cup Winners Cup there against Dynamo Moscow in 1972, but their record in Spain is otherwise poor having never won any of their other eight matches on Spanish soil. Olympique Lyon midfielder Jeremy Toulalan and striker Milan Baros have been left out of the squad to face VfB Stuttgart in a group E match on Wednesday. Czech Baros is suffering from a groin injury while Frances Toulalan has a knee injury. (REUTERS)

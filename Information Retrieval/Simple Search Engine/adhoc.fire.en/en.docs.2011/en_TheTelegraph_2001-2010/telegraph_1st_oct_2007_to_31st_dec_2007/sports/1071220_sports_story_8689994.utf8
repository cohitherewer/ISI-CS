 United player arrested 

 Jonny Evans 
Manchester: Manchester United defender Jonny Evans was being questioned by police on Wednesday in connection with an alleged rape of a woman at the clubs Christmas party. The 19-year-old Northern Ireland international was arrested on Tuesday evening after turning himself into police. 
A 26-year-old woman was allegedly assaulted early on Tuesday at the Great John Street Hotel in downtown Manchester. United players booked the entire hotel for a party on Monday night. 
Police are currently investigating a report of rape at a hotel in Manchester city centre, Greater Manchester police said. At about 4:15am on Tuesday, police were called to the hotel on Great John Street to a report that a 26-year-old woman had been raped. Inquiries are continuing. 
A police force member, speaking on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said that Evans was the 19-year-old man in custody. 
A British tabloid and Britains Press Association also identified Evans as the man under arrest. Manchester United has declined to comment, but police were expected to update the media on the investigation later Wednesday. 
Evans was among the United players photographed leaving the clubs Christmas lunch Monday. He is not a regular in Alex Fergusons first team, but was handed a Champions League start last week at AS Roma with progression to the next round already secured. (AP)

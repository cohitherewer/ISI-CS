 Covered rivals pose new challenge to Indian eves
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Iranian women during a football match New Delhi: Playing football with clothes covering from head to toe is certainly not a comfortable experience. On Saturday, when India play Iran in the AFC womens championship in Gurgaon, the hosts will witness this uncomfortable experience  but from the other end. The eves from Iran will take the field wearing specially made head gears, long-sleeve shirts and trousers. Under the Iranian law, women footballers are required to cover their body before playing a match in an open stadium. Indian women, led by Ronibala Chanu of Manipur, will wear the usual football outfit. There is no restriction on our dress code when we go to Iran to play the away match on October 27, said All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary Alberto Colaco. As per Fifa rules, Iranian girls are allowed to play in their specially made outfit, he added. Iran are participating in the AFC womens championship for the first time. The team recently took part in the West Asian Womens Football Games and finished runners-up. The Iranian girls have played so little in the international arena that Fifa is yet to list them in the official rankings. Indian senior girls are placed 11th in Asia and 55th in the world. After a prolonged struggle with the authorities back home, Iranian women finally managed to acquire permission to play football. Their first proper match was held on April 28, 2006 when they ever played against other footballers in front of fans. The players wore specially designed sports headscarves. Only women were allowed into the stadium. The team is arriving on Thursday, said Colaco. Anyone can come and watch the match. There is no restriction. The security, however, will be strict, as per AFC instructions.

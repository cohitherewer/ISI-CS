 Dilip not amused by Board directive
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Dilip Vengsarkar discusses a point with Sourav Ganguly in Jaipur on Saturday. (PTI) Jaipur: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar, one learns, hasnt been amused by a Board directive asking him not to write columns. A controversy arose when he recently wrote for a player-management company, which handles the business interests of quite a few in Team India and some emerging cricketers. Vengsarkar, who is in town for the fifth and final ODI, declined to comment (I have absolutely nothing to say) but a confidant told The Telegraph that he was extremely cut up with the Boards double standards. Dilip feels the Board should also bar technical committee chairman Sunil Gavaskar and the National Cricket Academy chairman, Ravi Shastri, from writing columns... Hes doing an honorary job and the Board cant deprive him of his livelihood, the confidant pointed out. While Vengsarkar has stopped syndicating columns in English (through that player-management company), he continues to write in a leading Marathi newspaper. According to the confidant, the columns in Marathi arent handled by any agency. Dilip sends the material on his own. Its to be seen if the Board clamps down even harder in the next few days. If it does, whats Vengsarkar (a former India captain) going to do?

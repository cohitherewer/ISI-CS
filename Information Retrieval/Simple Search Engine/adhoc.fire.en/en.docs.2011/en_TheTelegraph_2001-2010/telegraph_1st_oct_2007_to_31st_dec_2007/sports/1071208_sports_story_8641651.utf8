 Dilip to meet Pawar on Dec. 14

 A STAFF REPORTER
 Vengsarkar 
Calcutta: Dilip Vengsarkars one-on-one with Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar will take place in Mumbai on December 14. This means the national selection committee chairman will be able to watch the third and final Test versus Pakistan in Bangalore from Saturday. 
Vengsarkars meeting with Pawar was originally scheduled for this weekend. 
The BCCIs finance committee meeting is scheduled on the same day while the working committee meets on December 16. 
Vengsarkar attended the last selection committee meeting in Bangalore on Wednesday to pick the squad for the third Test and the probables for the Test series Down Under. 
Vengsarkar left midway through the Calcutta Test following differences with the BCCI over the guidelines issued to the selectors. 
The former captain and the BCCI have been at war after he was barred from writing. That he would write for a Calcutta-based player management company is what irked the bigwigs the most. 
Hectic parleys over the phone with Pawar on the eve of the selection meeting, after the BCCI softened its stand, helped Vengsarkar to change his mind and proceed to Bangalore and chair the selection meeting. Pawar said he wanted Vengsarkar to continue in the post.

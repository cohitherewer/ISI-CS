 Afforce may do the trick 
 STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs ward, Afforce (Islam-up), may lift the 1,200m Access All Areas Cup, Saturdays main event. The challenge to the Diffident colt may come from the Imran Chisty-ridden Over The Limit who had gone down narrowly to Foot Tapper, even without a serious effort. On Friday, Chistys riding was also questionable on a fancied runner. It could be a repeat story on the day and work to Afforces advantage. 				 										Again, Chisty-willing, Daniel Davids Golden Celebration may win the Regal Star Plate unless the stable money is directed towards Touching Moment.				 										4.

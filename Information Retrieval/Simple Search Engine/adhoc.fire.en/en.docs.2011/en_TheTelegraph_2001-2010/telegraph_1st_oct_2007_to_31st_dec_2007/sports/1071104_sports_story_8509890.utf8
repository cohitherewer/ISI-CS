 CRICKET BRIEFS 
 Bar on Dilip rsquo;s columns Dilip Vengsarkar 
	 Mumbai: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar has been asked not to write columns in the newspapers. quot;We have asked Vengsarkar not to write columns in newspapers, quot; BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told reporters here on Saturday. 
	The Telegraph had reported on October 30 that some key officials would raise the issue with BCCI president Sharad Pawar.  
	There appears to be a conflict of interest on the issue as the agency which syndicates Vengsarkar's column also represents the commercial interests of some Indian cricketers, including ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.  Dew control measures 
	 Mohali: Ground authorities at the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) stadium will use a chemical spray to control the dew on the ground during the second ODI between India and Pakistan on November 8. ldquo;We will be using a chemical spray called APSA-80, which we had used successfully a year back during the Champions Trophy, rdquo; PCA curator and chairman of the BCCI pitch committee Daljit Singh said. Sunny raps selectors 
	 Kolhapur: Sunil Gavaskar on Saturday made a veiled attack on the selection committee for their decision to drop Rahul Dravid from the first two ODIs against Pakistan. ldquo;Selection process not only affects the morale of the team but also benefits the opposition, rdquo; Gavaskar said when asked about Dravid rsquo;s exclusion.  NCA steps  
	 Mumbai: The revamped National Cricket Academy (NCA), with Ravi Shastri at its helm, decided to appoint a physio, trainer, fielding coach and if possible a fast bowling coach to fulfil its aim of becoming the finishing school for young players and a rehab centre for injured ones.

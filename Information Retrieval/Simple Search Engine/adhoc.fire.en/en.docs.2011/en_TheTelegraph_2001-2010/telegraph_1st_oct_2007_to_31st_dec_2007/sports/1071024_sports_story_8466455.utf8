 Yuvraj supports limited number of Twenty20 ties
			Yuvraj Singh at a promotional in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)		Mumbai: Yuvraj Singh supported the ICCs decision to limit the number of Twenty20 Internationals for every team in a calendar year. It obviously feels great to be part of the World Twenty20 winning team, but this format is more of an entertainment for the crowd and the batsmen, said the flamboyant left-hander on the sidelines of a promotional on Tuesday. Hence the ICCs decision to restrict the number of Twenty20 Internationals in a calendar year (seven per country) is welcome, explained the man who was Mahendra Singh Dhonis deputy in South Africa as well as the recent ODI series against Australia. For me, excelling in Twenty20 or in the 50-over format is not the benchmark. Performing consistently in Tests is what I am looking forward to before being called a complete cricketer, said the 25-year-old son of Yograj Singh. Yuvraj endorsed Dhonis view that non-stop cricket was making the players a tired lot and said breaks were welcome. We have been playing continuously for the last five months. Certainly the bodies get tired. But we do feel happy being on the field and playing, since cricket is our job. Yuvraj preferred to play with a straight bat when asked how the players would react if Dhoni was named Test captain too. Thats up to the selectors and not for the players to comment on, he said. On the tour of Australia in December, Yuvraj aid: An Australian tour is never easy for any team, especially from the subcontintent. But the team (led by Sourav Ganguly) had played well on its last visit. We hope this will be an interesting tour too, he said. (PTI)

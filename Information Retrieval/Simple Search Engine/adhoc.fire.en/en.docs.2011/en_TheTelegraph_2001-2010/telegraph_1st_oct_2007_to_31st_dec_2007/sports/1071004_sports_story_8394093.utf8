 Roma fail to tackle Rooney brilliance
 - Champions 
 - League Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter Milan earn full points Henry Winter Manchester Uniteds Wayne Rooney in an aerial challenge with Romas Daniele de Rossi at Old Trafford on Tuesday. (AP) There was no repeat of the Magnificent Seven, but Manchester Uniteds favourite gunslinger, Wayne Rooney, still shot AS Roma down on Tuesday. Vanquished 1-7 on their last visit here, the Italians proved far more obdurate opponents but they still could not deal with the one flash of brilliance from Rooney, whose 70th-minute shot was unstoppable. One-nil to the United is becoming a familiar refrain this season, this being their sixth such scoreline in eight games. The solitary goal was still a special affair, comprising all the qualities of speed of thought and movement and deftness of touch that Sir Alex Ferguson expects from his players. This was United at their fast-flowing, devastating best, completely catching the Italians out. Michael Carrick performed the quarter back duties, exchanging passes with Cristiano Ronaldo before finding Nani. Apprentice to Ronaldos established sorcerer, Nani impressed all evening, and his pass to Rooney was perfect. Watched by an admiring Steve McClaren, Rooney had angled his run across Romas defenders, and Nani read his intentions superbly. Rooney shot first time, injecting real power into the ball which skimmed across the turf past Gianluca Curci, Romas goalkeeper. United, the new kings of parsimony, had their goal, their victory and never mind the quality, feel the quantity of points. Rooney and company now sit atop group F with two wins out of two. Tuesdays victory did complicate one issue: the identity of Uniteds best strike-force. Clearly Rooney has to start and Ferguson simply has to find the striker who works most successfully with the England man, Carlos Tevez or Louis Saha. Tevez and Rooney appear too similar, both exuding most danger when playing off a front man. Ferguson appeared to have had misgivings about the Rooney-Tevez axis as he gave Saha his first start since February. Yet Rooney and Saha rarely clicked. It was only when the Frenchman came off, a little bundle of Argentinian energy charged on and Rooney pushed up, that United finally cut Roma apart. The Italians suffered a setback an hour before kick-off when their goalkeeper Doni fell ill, perhaps remembering events of six months ago, so ushering Curci in for his Champions League debut. Otherwise, the Italians had been determined to make sure that what occurred on that extraordinary April evening was a one-off. Uniteds players were certainly greeted with a sustained volley of expletives from the 900 Roma fans amid the 73,652 crowd. Recalling that frailty, United again went for the jugular, looking for any vulnerability, although the first half brought only frustration. United kept looking to their flying wingers. Nani, dangerous when on his feet, eluded Cicinho 11 minutes from the break, nipped to the byeline and lifted over a magnificent cross that Rooney met on the volley, the ball flying disappointingly over. Rooney kept dropping off Saha, trying to pull the strings, working in the no-mans land area he finds most productive. Attempting to weave some magic, Rooney was clattered by Philippe Mexes, who went into the referees book. A more cohesive force than last time, Roma seemed far from over-awed, and built some decent moves of their own, particularly when the ball enjoyed the company of the busy feet of Alberto Aquilani and Francesco Totti. Romas captain, a lone striker who loves to drop deep, twice fashioned enough space for 20-yard shots, both held by the solid Tomasz Kuszczak. Simone Perrotta went close, a moment that will have excited his watching parents, Francesco and Anna-Maria, who raised the future Italian World Cup-winner in nearby Ashton-under-Lyne. Inevitably, though, it was Totti who should have struck just after the re-start. Seizing on Ludovic Giulys cutback, Totti nudged the ball on and, as Kuszczak came out, lifted it over the keeper but also over the bar. United then had to survive a nervous moment when Carrick caught Mancinis ankle with a clumsy tackle in the area. Old Trafford breathed a sigh of relief as Manuel Mejuto Gonzalez waved play on. Reprieved, United celebrated with Rooneys fine goal. Fergusons side were now really in the mood, moving the ball around with a touch of swagger. Paul Scholes fired a shot wide. Yet, in a tense climax, Roma posed real problems and Perrotta and Mauro Esposito should really have equalised. United were caked in sweat and  in Ronaldos case  blood. Working hard to close down Roman attackers, Ronaldo took an accidental elbow from Marko Vucinic in the face, opening up a gash and sending blood spilling down his cheek. Ronaldo was led away for four stitches. But it was Roma who suffered most damage on Tuesday.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

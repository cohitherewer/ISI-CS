 CRICKET BRIEFS 
 Razzaq changes decision 
	 Lahore: Pakistan allrounder Abdul Razzaq Saturday reversed his retirement decision but said he remained committed to his contract with the breakaway Indian Cricket League (ICL). ldquo;The reason I have decided to come out of retirement is because I want to play cricket not only at the domestic level but also at the international level. I spoke to my seniors at my club P amp;T Gymkhana and they advised me I still had a lot of cricket left in me, rdquo; Razzaq said. 
	 ldquo;I will be playing for my departmental team from November 1 in Sheikhupura and other domestic games as well as I want to get back into match form and enjoy my cricket, rdquo; he said. 
	 One of the category A contracted players with the PCB, Razzaq said he was now available if the national selectors wanted him.  Pak selector hopeful 
	 Lahore: The high pressure tour to India starting next month will make Pakistan players more consistent performers in the long run, chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said Sunday. 
	 ldquo;There is no doubt the Indian tour is very important. It is never easy playing against India in India but that is the best way also for many of the younger players to come of age and mature, rdquo; Salahuddin said. 
	 ldquo;We are strong in both the pace and spin departments. We have picked a specialist spinner in Abdul Rehman and have three back-up spinners in Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik and Fawad Alam. There is a lot of variety in our spin bowling, rdquo; Salahuddin said. Jayasuriya hits 154 
	 Brisbane: Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya served warning to the Australian team when he smashed 154 on the first day of the tourists rsquo; three-day match against a Chairman rsquo;s XI in Adelaide on Saturday. At stumps on the first day, Sri Lanka were 335 for four with Thilan Samaraweera not out on 53. 
	 Recalled batsman Marvan Atapattu made 56 and Michael Vandort 55 on a day when the Sri Lankans dominated an attack made up of players not needed for domestic duty this weekend. The only sour news was a thigh injury to Kumar Sangakkara, who retired hurt after making just one.

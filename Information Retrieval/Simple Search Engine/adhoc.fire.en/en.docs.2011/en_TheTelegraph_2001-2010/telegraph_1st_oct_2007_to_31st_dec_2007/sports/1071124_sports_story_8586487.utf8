(AFP) Dongguan (China): Jyoti Randhawa and Gaurav Ghei slumped to tied 23rd spot after returning a three-over 75 in the second round of the Omega Mission Hills World Cup here on Friday. The Indian pair, tied 11th on Thursday with a 65, slipped down with a total of fourunder 140. Americans Boo Weekley and Heath Slocum moved into sole lead with a total of 14-under 130 after carding a threeunder 69 in the second round of the 28-team event. Its a difficult format, Slocum told reporters. We would have liked to have shot something lower but we started the day ahead and we we finished it ahead so were in good shape going into tomorrow. The English pair of Justin Rose and Ian Poulter along with the Scottish duo of Colin Montgomerie and Marc Warren were a shot adrift at the tied second spot after returning an identical 68. Its a little bit of a shame when youve got off to such a flying start, said Poulter after a four-under 68. The only really disappointing thing was the first putt on the 17th. But we certainly go into tomorrow feeling good. South Africans Retief Goosen and Trevor Immelman carded a 69 to take the third spot with a total of 16under 132. Among other Asian contenders, Thailands Thongchai Jaidee and Prayad Marksaeng endured a frustrating day with a 76 to slip back to tied 19th place. The Korean pair of Lee Sung and Lee Seungho were four shot off the pace after firing a 69 to total 134 along with the Dutch duo of RobertJan derksen and Maarten Lafeber, who also carded a 69.  (PTI)

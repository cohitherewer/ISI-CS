 India end tied 17th 
 Scotlands Colin Montgomerie and Marc Warren after defeating the US in a play-off to clinch the title on Sunday. (AFP) Dongguan (China): Jyoti Randhawa and Gaurav Ghei carded their worst round to finish a disappointing tied 17th in the Omega Mission Hills World Cup on Sunday. The Indian duo totalled a 12-under 276 to join Austria, Italy and Canada in 17th place at the Mission Hills Golf Club. Scotland earned their first World Cup through Colin Montgomerie and Marc Warren, who beat American duo of Boo Weekley and Heath Slocum with a par on the third play-off hole. This triumph will erase Scotlands heartbreaking defeat in the play-off last year when Germanys Bernhard Langer and Marcel Siem lifted the title. Scotland shot six-under 66 while the Americans carded 67 to finish level at 25-under 263. Fantastic, Montgomerie told reporters after finally getting his hands on the trophy at the ninth attempt. Its been a long time for Scotland, weve been runners-up six times and Marc and I were last year. To come back and win it after losing the playoff last year is superb. The Americans looked set for victory when the Scots twice found the sand on the first extra hole but Warren nailed a 12-foot putt for par and Slocum just missed a birdie effort. Slocum had successfully sunk a five-foot birdie putt at the same green to force the playoff, giving the Americans a five-under 67 to match the Scots on 25-under for the tournament after the final round foursomes. An eagle at the 15th courtesy of a sublime six iron from Montgomerie and a six-foot Warren putt was the highlight for the Scots in their round of six-under 66. A birdie would have been good but an eagle was superb, said Montgomerie. It gave us the outright lead for the first time today and although the Americans caught us with a great birdie at the last, we felt very good about ourselves after that. The Americans had led by a shot after all three previous rounds in their pursuit of a 24th World Cup victory for their country. We feel kind of disappointed of how we finished up but overall it was a great week, said Weekley, the world No. 43. Like the Scots, they missed a long birdie effort at the second extra hole and it was Weekley who went wide with a 15-footer when he was putting for par to keep the match alive. The Chinese team of Zhang Lian-wei and Liang Wen-chong produced a final round of four-under 68 in to finish tied 11th on 17-under-par 271, eight shots behind the winners. They were the joint best Asian teams, with Koreas Lee Sung and Lee Seung-ho, in the 28-team competition.  (Agencies)

 Im not Harbhajans bunny, says Ricky Ponting

 Ricky Ponting is determined to prove that his first-Test failure against Harbhajan Singh is merely an aberration, and that he is not the off-spinners bunny. 
Ponting fell to Harbhajan in the second innings of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. He dismissed Ponting on all five occasions he batted during the dramatic 2001 series for a total of just 17 runs, including three ducks. 
Weve got a good little battle on our hands, Ponting was quoted as saying by The Australian in the wake of his sixth failure against Harbhajan in seven Tests. 
Im actually looking forward to Sydney now, especially after he said some of the stuff he has about getting me out. He must have a pretty short memory. 
Ponting admitted Harbhajan has had the better of their exchanges in Test cricket but stressed he had paid the bowler back in one-dayers. There was a World Cup final and all sorts of things in the middle of it (2001 and last week) he seems to have forgotten about pretty quickly, Ponting said. 
Cooley praise 
 Australian bowling coach Troy Cooley has rated the Australian attack equal to the Ashes winning England side which tasted success in 2005. 
Cooley guided the quartet of Simon Jones, Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard and Andrew Flintoff during Englands successful campaign. 
Now with Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson and Shaun Tait under his tutelage, Cooley said Australias young and improving attack was as potent as the England line-up two years ago. 
Im not generally keen on comparing, but Id say these guys are equally as good (as the England attack of 2005), Cooley said. Its hard to compare, but the one thing youd say about both attacks is that there is a lot of variation, and a lot of quality, he was quoted as saying in The Age. 
Symonds disapproval 
 International cricket would be better off without technological innovations like Hawk-Eye, which is not as accurate as it should be and only adds to the pressure on an on-field umpire, feels Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds. 
Theres been some great innovations in cricket in the past decade but I must admit theres one Im not the biggest fan of  Hawk-Eye, wrote Symonds in his column for The Daily Telegraph. 
Put simply, Hawk-Eye frustrates me.

 Zimbabwes Pak tour after polls
Karachi: Zimbabwe will tour Pakistan after the host countrys general elections on January 8 to play five one-day Internationals, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Tuesday. The official said that at the request of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union, which has had its Test status suspended since 2005, the team would play a four-day and three-day game before the one-day series. They want their players to get exposure in the longer duration of the game as they are not playing Tests at the moment, the official said. The one-day Internationals will be staged in Karachi, Hyderabad, Multan, Faisalabad and Sheikhupura. The official also said the itinerary for the Australian teams tour to Pakistan in March-April next year would be completed after a visit by a delegation of Cricket Australia following the elections. The Australian Cricketers Association have said they are worried about security arrangements in Pakistan because of the political upheaval.  (REUTERS)

 Jaffer can topple 309, says Sohail
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Former Pakistan captains Asif Iqbal and Aamer Sohail on Friday praised Wasim Jaffers unbeaten 192 at the Eden. If Asif was left speechless seeing the India opener bat on Day I of the Test, Sohail said the way he was going Virender Sehwags 309 may not be too far on Friday. The following are the excerpts (alphabetically): ASIF IQBAL: Jaffer (192 batting) played really well... I am speechless... It was tremendous to watch him. His innings showed class and I did not see him play any wrong shot during his day-long stay at the crease. His innings certainly has put India on top. AAMER SOHAIL: He played an exceptional innings. Having seen him bat in the first innings of the Kotla Test, I felt his innings of 32 was a bit shaky. He needed to improve his technique and scored 53 crucial runs chasing 203. Here, the team needed a good start and he delivered it today. It wont be a fair idea to compare him with anybody but there was a touch of Majid Khan in the way he was fluent with his strokes. He was playing exceptionally well. And he batted along with the great Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid with equal ease and took the centrestage. So far he has done well and with Shoaib Akhtar not at his best anything can happen 309 (Virender Sehwag in Multan) may not be far enough.

 We came with a flawed group and got the result we deserved: Greg
 - Former Team India coach expected World Cup campaign to end in disaster  Team India players in the dressing room during the World Cup match against Sri Lanka. India lost the match to bow out of the showcase event Melbourne: Even before setting foot on Caribbean soil, Greg Chappell was sure that Indias World Cup campaign would end in disaster as it was a flawed group without any youngsters. The former Team India coach says the team composition was such that it was never in the reckoning for the title. The Indians crashed out in the preliminary stage after losing to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. We came here with a flawed group and got the results that we deserved, Chappell said in ABC Televisions documentary Guru Greg. They (BCCI officials) might just decide that they dont want to talk about it. They might be quite happy to sack the lot of us and move on. Even before leaving for the quadrennial showpiece, Chappell said he knew that having old warhorses instead of fresh faces would ultimately prove detrimental to Indias chances. We tried to change it (the team) to move away from an old-based team To get some youth, young legs and some strong arms as well as some good batting and bowling, Chappell said in the programme, according to media reports. But unfortunately its been resisted, actively resisted from within the team and without so were going to finish up with an old team going to the World Cup. On paper it looks good but Im not sure its going to get the results the people of India want, he said. This is the second of Chappells sensational comments after Wednesdays revelation in the same programme where he termed the fan assault on him in Bhubaneswar as a racist attack. Reacting to that, though, he had blamed a section of the international media for attributing malicious motives to his actions. However, contacted by The Telegraph in Jaipur, Chappell said that he was not interested in talking about the documentary. Chappell said the Indian team needed an infusion of youth but the BCCI chose to look the other way and continued to hold on to veterans. To be quite honest, if there is not an intention of change, theres not much point myself or any of the other coaches for that matter getting involved. Its very difficult to keep putting wallpaper over the cracks, he explains in the documentary. The cracks have got big and the structure needs to be dealt with. Chappell told an Australian daily that he wanted to give up his job after the World Cup humiliation but chose to continue to honour his contract. I probably had the chance to walk away at that stage but you cant walk out halfway through something youve taken on, he said. Chappell also took a pot shot at Sourav Ganguly and said the left hander expected him to toe his line after being instrumental in getting him the coachs job. From an Indian cultural point of view, if you do someone a favour then they owe you for life, Chappell said. Sourav may have thought that was the way it is. It couldnt be that way. I cant work that way and it doesnt work that way from a team point of view. The team unit is more important than the individual, whoever that individual is, he added. (PTI)

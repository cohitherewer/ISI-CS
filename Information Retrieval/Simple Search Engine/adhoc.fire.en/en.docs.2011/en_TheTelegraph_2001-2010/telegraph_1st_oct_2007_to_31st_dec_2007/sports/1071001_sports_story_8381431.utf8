 Germany make Cup history
Shanghai: A solid defence and clinical efficiency in front of goal allowed Germany to triumph 2-0 over Brazil to become the first back-to-back winners of the womens World Cup on Sunday. German midfielder Simone Laudehrs headed goal in the dying minutes sealed the win, after captain Birgit Prinz had coolly slotted home early in the second half. The whole team played very well and I am very proud, German coach Silvia Neid said. We had an aim before the game that everybody should work their way back to defence as much as possible. We had 21 to 0 goals in the tournament, and thats pretty good, Neid said. German keeper Nadine Angerer made several extraordinary saves in the second half to maintain her clean sheet for the tournament. Despite dominating possession, Brazils talent-studded attack failed to breach the German defence, with breathtaking runs from Daniela and tournament top-scorer Marta repeatedly cut off at the last moment. Where lesser teams would have wilted, the Germans absorbed the pressure, bided their time and scored when it counted. The Brazilians, playing in their first final, were left to regret a number of missed chances, chief amongst them a penalty brilliantly parried by Angerer. Trailing 0-1 in the second half, Cristiane was brought down in the penalty area, leaving Marta to take the spot kick. The 21-year-old Fifa 2006 Player of the Year aimed left and low but Angerer lunged to save. Brazilian coach Jorge Barcellos said he was very sad at the result, but happy the team had played its best. We created a lot of chances today, but we just missed them. The Germans scored after their first real chance. (They) were better at finishing. Germanys win follows their 2003 triumph over Sweden in Los Angeles. Earlier, two-time World Cup winners United States trounced Norway 4-1 in the third-place playoff. (Reuters)

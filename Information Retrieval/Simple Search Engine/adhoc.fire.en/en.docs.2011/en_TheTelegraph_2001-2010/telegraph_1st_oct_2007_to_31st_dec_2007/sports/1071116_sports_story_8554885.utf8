 Gilchrist amazed by Indias Young Turks
Melbourne: Australias greatest ODI cricketer Adam Gilchrist thinks power-hitters in Mahendra Singh Dhonis side have redefined the game with their amazing strokeplay. Without naming any particular player, Gilchrist said he was stunned by some of the shots played by the Indian youngsters during the ICC World Twenty20 and the seven-ODI series last month. Some of the things I saw in India, some of the shots their young players are playing and the power in the game at that Twenty20 tournament was amazing, he was quoted as saying by a Sydney-based newspaper. Gilchrist said after looking at the Indian youngsters, he began to wonder whether his days as a power-hitter were all but over. I definitely feel like I have still got a role to play and still can be very much a feature in one-day cricket, but its a bit different. There may have been a time when I was a trailblazer, (but) I think it has surpassed me now. Im not saying Im redundant, its just the way the game is evolving, and its exciting, he explained. The wicket-keeper batsman, who was voted Australias greatest one-day cricketer by his fellow players, said the changing face of the game was making it tough for him to keep pace. The way the guys are hitting them these days, I dont feel like Im keeping up, Gilchrist, who turned 36 on Wednesday, said. The affable stumper felt Steve Waughs decision to promote him as an opener was the turning point of his career and helped him create a niche for himself.  (PTI)

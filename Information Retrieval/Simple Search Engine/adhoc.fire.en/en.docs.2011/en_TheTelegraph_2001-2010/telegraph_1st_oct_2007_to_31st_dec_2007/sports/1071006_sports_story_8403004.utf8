 Marion admits using steroids
DUFF WILSON amp; MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT Marion Jones Former track star Marion Jones, one of the most accomplished female athletes in the world, is expected to plead guilty to lying to federal agents about her use of performance-enhancing drugs, two lawyers connected with the case said on Thursday. The admission will end years of denial and probably lead to her being stripped of the record five medals she won in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Jones, 31, who won three gold and two bronze medals at the Sydney Games, will become the first athlete convicted in the cases arising out of the four-year Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative investigation that has fuelled a continuing series of steroid scandals in sports. Five men who manufactured, marketed or supplied the drugs to athletes have pleaded guilty, and three of them have served time in prison. Jones is expected to plead guilty to one count of making false statements to federal agents about her use of performance-enhancing drugs and one count of making false statements to federal agents in connection with a separate check fraud case, the lawyers said. Its the destruction of a heroine of the day, said Dick Pound, the chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency and a member of the International Olympic Committee. Its sad at one level, but its still tawdry cheating at another level. Pound, who said that the IOC had opened a file on Jones in 2001, said that her Olympic medals would be revoked. Jones wrote to family and friends in a letter that she unwittingly took the designer steroid THG that was supplied by her coach for two years beginning in 1999 and lied to federal agents about it in 2003, according to one of the lawyers, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Jones is scheduled to appear at the United States District Court in White Plains, Clifford Kirsch, the district executive , confirmed on Thursday. I do know shes on the calendar, he said. Thats all we know. Jones and her lawyers did not return calls for comment on Thursday. The United States attorneys office in San Francisco, that spearheaded the Balco case, also declined comment. Jones told investigators that she lied to protect herself and her former coach, Trevor Graham, who is awaiting trial in San Francisco on charges that he lied to federal agents. Jones said Graham had told her the chemical was flaxseed oil, but she later realised it was a steroid, the lawyers said. Jones will probably face a maximum of six months in jail, one of the lawyers said. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Jones had told family and close friends that she would be sentenced in three months under a plea bargain agreement and that she apologised for disappointing them. Jones, who turns 32 next Friday, has one child by her former partner Tim Montgomery, an Olympic gold medal sprinter who has been barred from competition for doping. She and Montgomery have been among a group of people also implicated in a check-cashing scheme. Montgomery has pleaded guilty.  NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

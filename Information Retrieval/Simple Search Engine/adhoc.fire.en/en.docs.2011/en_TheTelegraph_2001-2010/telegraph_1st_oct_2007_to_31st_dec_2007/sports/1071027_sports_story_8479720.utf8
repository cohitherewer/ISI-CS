 Martin Jol gets the boot
Martin Smith amp; John Ley Martin Jol Martin Jol was on Thursday sensationally sacked as Tottenham Hotspur manager before the 1-2 Uefa Cup loss against Getafe at White Hart Lane with Sevilla coach Juande Ramos set to be named as his replacement. Ramos is expected to take over by the beginning of next week with former Tottenham midfielder Gus Poyet as his No 2. Jols assistant, Chris Hughton, was also sacked, and Clive Allen and Alex Inglethorpe were named as caretaker managers. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said: For me, Martin and Chris departure is regrettable. Our greatest wish was to see results turn in our favour and for there to be no need for change. We feel honoured that Martin has been manager at our club, having seen us qualify twice for Europe. Chris has been with us since 1977, bar a three-year period, both as player and coach, and he has been an excellent ambassador for the club. They have been professional, popular and respected members of the coaching staff and there will always be a warm welcome for them both at the Lane. Despite the chairmans warm words it was a humiliating evening for Jol who watched his side suffer another dismal defeat. On a night of high emotion the fans sang his name loudly. He said: I can understand the position of the club in light of the results. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here. Tottenham Hotspur is a special club and I want to thank the terrific staff and players. For me the fans were always amazing with their support so I would also like to say thank you  I shall never forget them. The players were told by Jol of the decision in the dressing room after the match. He hugged members of the squad before leaving the floor to Damien Comelli, the director of football, to explain the situation to them. The timing of the announcement will have embarrassed the Tottenham board because, as a limited company, they are obliged to inform the Stock Exchange of any significant changes at the club. That would not have been possible until business opened this morning. However, Levy has been unable to hide his disappointment at Spurs poor start to the season, their worst for 19 years. As early as August, Spurs were linked with a move for Ramos. The courting never cooled, it seems. Ramos is likely to be at the helm for either the Carling Cup tie against Blackpool next Wednesday, or the League visit to Middlesbrough next weekend. There was no golden farewell for Jol on the pitch on Thursday. Tottenham, who have won just once in the Premier League this season, gave another disappointing performance, only enlivened by the reception given the departing man by the crowd once the news reached them. Michael Laudrup, the Getafe coach, said: I am sorry for Martin. But it is a hard world, the football world: one year you are fantastic, the next year the opposite. What he has done here is fantastic; he will have no problem getting another job. Time will tell.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

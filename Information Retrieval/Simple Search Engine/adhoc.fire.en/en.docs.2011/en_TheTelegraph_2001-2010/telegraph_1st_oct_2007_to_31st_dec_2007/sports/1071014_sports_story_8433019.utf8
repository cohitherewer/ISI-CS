 England lose chance
A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Englands 3-2 series win in Sri Lanka is certainly something for Paul Collingwood and his teammates to celebrate. After all, it included the sides first ODI win in the country for 25 years and is Englands first series win in a ODI rubber in the Asian sub-continent since 1987, when Mike Gattings team beat Pakistan 3-0 in the aftermath of the World Cup. But after crashing to defeat by 107 runs in the final match in Colombo on Saturday evening, Collingwood could be forgiven for thinking what might have been, even as he held aloft the series trophy. According to an ICC release, victory in that final match would have secured fourth spot in the LG ICC ODI Championship table and Englands highest placing since January 2005 ahead of a series in South Africa. Instead England remain in seventh position, the same spot they occupied at the start of the series. ODI Rankings 1. Australia (130), 2. South Africa (124), 3. New Zealand (114), 4. Sri Lanka (108), 5. Pakistan (108), 6. India (108), 7. England (107), 8. West Indies (102), 9. Bangladesh (48), 10. Ireland (28), 11. Zimbabwe (17), 12. Kenya (0).

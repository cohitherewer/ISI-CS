 Well play, let Indians talk: Ponting
OUR CORRESPONDENT Ricky Ponting at a press conference in Hyderabad on Thursday Hyderabad: Mind games have been an integral part of any series involving the men from Down Under. Now Ricky Ponting would try and make us believe that their attitude has often been misconstrued! Aggression of the players on and off the field has threatened to take alarming proportions in the ongoing series. Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh were in the thick of action in Kochi and, on Thursday, Ricky Ponting decided to speak up for his teammates, providing it with a new dimension. The Australian captain made it clear that his men were not going to take anything lying down and were ready to fight fire with fire. Ponting was reacting to Harbhajans comments in the Australian media and at a promotional here on Wednesday evening that they had targeted him with personal and vulgar words during the second ODI. They (Australians) say they play in the right spirit, but they didnt in reality. There is nothing gentlemanly about the way they play We will come hard at the Aussies. We are determined to play tough cricket, said the off-spinner in reference to the incidents that followed his dismissal by Michael Clarke. Ponting was quick to react at the news conference on the eve of the match No. 3. Good luck to him! said the rival captain. I really dont care to tell the truth He has got plenty to say on the field and whenever someone says something back to him he is the first one to run away from it. We play our cricket in a nice aggressive way. We play within the rules and the spirit of the game. They are the ones who have come out and made all the statements since weve been here This new India and the new aggressive outlook, the way they are going to play We will go and play the best aggressive cricket we can and leave all the talking to the Indians, Ponting said. The Aussie captain felt people were reading much into it than was needed. It has been a long time There has been a lot more made about all the sledging and stuff like that over the years than is necessary. Probably even now we are adding more fuel than required. Perception is an amazing thing. If we were ever as bad as everyone said we are or, had been, then we would have had a lot more Australian players reported, especially in the last couple of years. Aggression doesnt mean sledging or giving personal barrage, it is having a presence on the field and playing good, aggressive cricket. I wasnt there the other day, but there were a few things on the field and Harbhajan was involved in one. If you look at both his and Sreesanths record over the last two years, they have been involved in a lot of those altercations, he said. Its not that the Indians are defending Sreesanth. Yuvraj Singh made it clear that the pacers behaviour in Kochi was not welcome and that he had been spoken to and asked to calm down. It happens sometimes But he should concentrate more on cricket in the next game... I thought both teams overdid it a bit in the last game, Yuvraj said. Ponting said that match referee Chris Broad was quick to explain things in perspective. It is pretty clear to me that nobody stepped out of the line. I think both teams were right on the limit the other day and the match referee made that pretty clear to us after the game. He said there were a few things that wasnt pleasing. Both sides were right on the edge. Perhaps Broad needs to do a lot of backroom work to improve their on-pitch behaviour in the remaining of the series.

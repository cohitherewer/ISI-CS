 Dhoni rues schedule

Melbourne: Indian vice-captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has admitted that the side goes into the Boxing Day Test against Australia short of match practice as just one warm-up game before the four-Test series was not enough to get acclimatised with the conditions here. 
Its always better to have a few sessions before a big Test match (and) we dont really have much time for practice, Dhoni was quoted as saying in an Australian daily. 
The Indian team arrived here on Wednesday and started their only warm-up match against Victoria on Thursday. Dhoni felt the three-day game was just not enough considering that rain was threatening to play spoilsport. 
Youd love to have more time, but thats too many ifs and buts. If it rains theres nothing that can be done about it  well go to the indoors and have a knock, do whatever we can. 
Getting used to the conditions is very important, so the practice game is important, especially when youre coming from a series in India, he said. 
The swashbuckling wicketkeeper-batsman also said that the bouncy tracks in Australia were a difficult challenge for the visiting bowlers. 
When youre playing in Australia, the length youre bowling is very important, very different to where you bowl in the sub-continent or England, he said. 
India play their opening Test of the four-match series from December 26.

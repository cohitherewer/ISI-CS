 Gambhir-Afridi in war of words
OUR CORRESPONDENTKanpur: Gautam Gambhir and Shahid Afridi were involved in a slanging match during the 20th over of the Indian innings on Sunday. Umpire Ian Gould intervened to prevent any further flare-up. As Gambhir pushed Afridi to short third-man and set off for a single, the two collided in the middle of the pitch. The batsman felt the Pakistani had blocked his path and a war of words between the two ensued. Gould spoke to both players separately and later to Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik. Both Malik and his Indian counterpart, however, played it down at the post-match press conference. I think people love to see a little aggression of this kind in one-day cricket, isnt it? Mahendra Singh Dhoni said. At times, aggression spills out. After the incident, I said sorry to Gambhir These things happen. There was nothing serious about it, maintained Malik. Malik also pointed out that Match Referee Roshan Mahanama didnt speak to him nor Afridi after the incident.

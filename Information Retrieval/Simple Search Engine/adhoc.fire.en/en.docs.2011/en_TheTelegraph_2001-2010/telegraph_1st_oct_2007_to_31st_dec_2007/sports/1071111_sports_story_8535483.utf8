 Bond injury adds to Black Caps woes
Johannesburg: Centuries by Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis enabled South Africa to set New Zealand a towering target of 531 runs for victory on the third day of the first Test on Saturday. New Zealand limped to the close on 57 for three after South Africa declared their second innings on 422 for three. Scott Styris was 16 not out with Brendon McCullum on 11 for the visitors. As if South Africas onslaught wasnt enough, the Black Caps suffered another telling blow on Saturday when ace fast bowler Shane Bond was ruled out of the rest of the tour after tearing an abdominal muscle on Day III of the first Test. Bond will be out of action for four to six weeks and will return home after the match, New Zealand manager Lindsay Crocker said. Kallis made 186 and became the eighth player to score 9,000 Test runs while Amla was unbeaten on a career-best 176, including 24 fours. Their third-wicket partnership of 330 was the biggest for South Africa in Tests against New Zealand, surpassing the 183 from Gary Kirsten and Daryll Cullinan in Auckland in 1998-99. South Africa resumed on 179 for two, and Amla and Kallis added 108 runs in the wicketless morning session. New Zealand squandered a chance to dismiss Kallis for 108 when substitute fielder Michael Mason at mid-off dropped a catch off Daniel Vettori. An hour after lunch, Kallis played a tired drive to a delivery from medium-pacer Jacob Oram and was caught behind by wicketkeeper McCullum. He faced 262 balls and hit 25 fours and three sixes. New Zealand slipped to 39 for three in the first 10 overs of their second innings with Craig Cumming, Stephen Fleming and Ross Taylor all falling to slip catches. Dale Steyn had Cumming caught at first slip by Graeme Smith for seven before the South Africa captain held another to remove Fleming for 17.  (REUTERS)

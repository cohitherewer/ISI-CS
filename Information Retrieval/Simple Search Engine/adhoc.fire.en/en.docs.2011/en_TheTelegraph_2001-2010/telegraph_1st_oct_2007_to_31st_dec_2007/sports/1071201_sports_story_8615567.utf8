 Bindra briefs on IPL
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTCalcutta: Perhaps it wasnt anything more than a coincidence, but the fact is that Team India got briefed about the Indian Premier League (IPL) around the same time as the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL) got under way in Panchkula. According to The Telegraphs sources, former Board president Inderjit Singh Bindra conducted the briefing. The IPL, it may be recalled, is being promoted by the Board. Bindra wasnt available for comment, but the session on Friday evening lasted around 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the Boards bigwigs will be meeting here informally on Saturday.

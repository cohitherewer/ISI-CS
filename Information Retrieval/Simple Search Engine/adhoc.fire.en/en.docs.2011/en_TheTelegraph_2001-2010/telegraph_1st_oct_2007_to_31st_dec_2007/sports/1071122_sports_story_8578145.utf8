 Yuvraj misses cut again
 - FIRST TEST
 - Stiff back keeps out Gul; Tanveer to make debutJAYDEEP BASUNew Delhi: These are challenging times for Anil Kumble. He has been saddled with the responsibility of guiding a combination of youth and experience against arch rivals Pakistan in the three-match series for the IndianOil Cup. Against an opposition going through a period of transition, India start clear favourites in the first Test beginning at the Kotla on Thursday. On paper, India appear stronger in batting and bowling, despite the absence of R.P. Singh and Sreesanth. Zaheer Khan and Munaf Patel will share the new ball, while spin twins Kumble and Harbhajan Singh will back them up on a wicket that is expected to turn in the later stages. Pakistan were dealt a blow as Umar Gul, who was expected to play a key role, was ruled out with a stiff back. According to well placed sources, the decision was taken after he underwent an MRI on Wednesday. Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik felt that the Kotla track could be spinner-friendly, while Kumble thought it would be a sporting pitch. I would love to take the pitch out of the equation, Kumble said. As a player, you do take a look I think its a good sporting track. But instead of thinking about it, we are planning to do well in the match. Malik and Pakistan are obviously banking on Shoaib Akhtar. Shoaib is bowling at a great speed. He could be our trump card, the captain declared, before quickly adding: Even Danish (Kaneria) is a fine spinner. He may turn out to be a match winner. Whatever the nature of the pitch, fast bowlers always take wickets, said Malik. That has been the trend in recent Tests. The good news for the home team is that vice-captain and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni is fit to play. Team India have finalised their playing XI, though it was not made official. Yuvraj Singh, Man of the Series in the ODIs, will once again have to warm the benches as the team management decided to keep faith in experience. While Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik will open, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman would follow. Munaf and Ishant Sharma have been drafted into the squad as replacements for RP and Sreesanth, but Munaf is set to get the nod. As far as the Pakistan XI is concerned, Sohail Tanveer will make his debut. Shoaib and Mohammed Sami will be the other quicks, while Kaneria and Malik will provide the spin option. Pakistan have two proven performers in the batting department, in Mohammed Yousuf and vice-captain Younis Khan. The Indians had a long nets session early on Wednesday, followed by Pakistan. While the others got down to business immediately, Kumble had a long discussion with Tendulkar before joining teammates. Dhoni also had a long stint at the nets. After a fielding session, he worked on his keeping for half an hour with Robin Singh. The ODI captain was still not through, and batted for 20 minutes.

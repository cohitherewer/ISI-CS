 Sipaeya loses

New Delhi: Sunil Kumar Sipaeyas dream run at the SAIL Open Challenger Series came to a halt when he was outplayed in straight sets by Czech Tomas Cakl in the semi-finals bringing an end to the Indian campaign in the $ 50,000 event Friday. 
The wildcard went down 4-6, 2-6 to the unseeded Cakl, who now takes on fifth seed Russian Michail Elgin in the summit clash Saturday. 
Elgin thrashed eighth seed Ivan Sergeyev of the Ukraine 6-1, 6-1 in the other semi-final. 
Sipaeya, who stunned second seed Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi in a marathon quarter final Thursday, looked out of sorts and found the going tough against Cakl. (PTI)

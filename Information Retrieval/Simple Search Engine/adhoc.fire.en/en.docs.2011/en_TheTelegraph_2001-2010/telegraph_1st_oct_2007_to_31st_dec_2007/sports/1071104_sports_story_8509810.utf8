 Nadal on course for a rare double
 Richard Gasquet after beating Andy Murray Paris: Rafael Nadal stayed on course for a rare double by surviving a spirited challenge from Marcos Baghdatis to down the unseeded Cypriot 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the semi-finals of the Paris Masters on Saturday. The world number two, appearing at the $2.45 million indoor event for the first time, is trying to become the second player to win the Paris Masters and the French Open after Andre Agassi. The muscular Spaniard, who could emulate Agassis 1999 feat by claiming both showcase tournaments in the same year, will face Argentine David Nalbandian or Frenchman Richard Gasquet in Sundays final. Baghdatis, featuring in the last four of a Masters Series event for the first time, needed to win the title to stand a chance of making the Masters Cup featuring the worlds top eight. His defeat hands the last remaining spot at the Nov. 11-18 season-finale in Shanghai to Gasquet. Gasquet ended Andy Murrays Masters Cup hopes by beating the British No. 1 6-3, 0-6, 6-4 in quarter finals on Friday. Russias Mikhail Youzhny also crashed out on Friday with a 4-6, 2-6 defeat by Nadal in the quarters. The unseeded Nalbandian, who had beaten Federer in the Madrid Masters final late last month, needed three sets and nearly as many hours to down Spains David Ferrer 7-6, 6-7, 6-2 in a ferocious contest featuring thrilling rallies.

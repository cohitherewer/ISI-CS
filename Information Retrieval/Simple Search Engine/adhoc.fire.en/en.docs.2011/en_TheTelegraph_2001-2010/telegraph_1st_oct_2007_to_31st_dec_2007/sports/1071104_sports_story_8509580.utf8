 Younis bats for seniors
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Younis Khan New Delhi: Younis Khan feels it is time both India and Pakistan work out a policy on how to treat senior cricketers. The Pakistan vice-captain said in a press conference on Saturday that there was no alternative to having experienced players in international cricket. Without them, a team would be in trouble. A team needs experienced cricketers, Younis said. When a match reaches a crucial stage, a youngster may either finish it off or break down mentally. In such a situation, a senior cricketer could be of help to the team. After all, they have gone through similar circumstances several times in their career, the veteran Pakistani said. Seniors are used to playing under pressure. For players like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and me these things come easily. Sachin has been playing international cricket since 1989. You dont need to tell him what pressure is all about. Younis feels Sachin always makes a difference. Sachin is still in great form. Make no mistake Given a chance he might come up with another 30 centuries. The right-hander from North West Frontier Province, who has 14 hundreds in 55 Tests to his credit, made no secret of the fact that he was against the way Rahul Dravid had been ignored. There should be a definite policy on how to treat senior cricketers, he said. For the moment Dravid has been dropped. If India lose the first two one-dayers, he may be rushed back. My question is why should it be like that? Nothing should be done on compulsion. There are better ways of dealing with things, said Younis. About grooming juniors, Younis said only deserving players should get into the national team. People talk about Australia and how they groom juniors. I agree but here in India and Pakistan we should only take those who are cap- able of delivering at the top level. These are what some of the other Pakistan players had to say (in alphabetical order): RAO IFTIKHAR ANJUM: I dont possess the pace of a Shoaib (Akhtar) or Mohammed (Asif), but I can still trouble the Indian batsmen with my line and length. My task is to contain the batsmen in the middle overs. I have played against Yuvraj (Singh) and (Robin) Uthappa before So I know how to tackle them. I try to bring variation to my bowling. Time was when a score of 250 was considered a winning total. Nowadays teams even chase 400 and win. SALMAN BUTT: At the moment our openers do lack consistency. But that wont be a problem against India. Things will be more stable than it was against South Africa. I hope to emerge a top performer. Its not as if I was stripped of the vice-captaincy. I relinquished the honour after consulting my seniors and elders. I have time on my side. I am sure I will get it back one day. MISBAH-UL HAQ: Id never be able to forget the Twenty20 World Cup final. For me, it was a tragic end to a great match. It took me quite some time to get over it. When I hit that crucial shot, I was confident of getting a boundary. Instead I turned and found Sreesanth taking the catch. I have been playing that kind of shot from the start of my career. It has always fetched me runs. Inzamam-ul Haq had always been my role model. It will be difficult to fill his place. My role as the No. 6 in ODIs will be no different than it is in Twenty20 matches. I will have to go for big shots. ABDUR REHMAN: I am not at all tense. Its all media hype. Why should I be tense? All I am looking forward to is playing some good cricket against India. On this tour I want to enjoy myself, see new places, make new friends and play good cricket. Most important, however, is to win the series. SOHAIL TANVIR: My (wrong-footed) bowling action comes to me naturally. I never realised how strange it was till I watched myself on screen. But I get a lot of swing. You dont get much swing on subcontinent wickets but with my kind of action I manage it. On Friday, against Delhi, I derived some swing from the pitch. Rule changes in ODIs have made things more difficult for bowlers. One-dayers were always a batsmans game, and now even more so.

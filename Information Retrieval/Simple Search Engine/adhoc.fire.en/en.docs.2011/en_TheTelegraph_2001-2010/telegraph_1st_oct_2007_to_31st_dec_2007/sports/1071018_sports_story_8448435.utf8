 Kartik: I was lucky
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: It was Murali Kartiks day. He first returned career best figures of six for 27 and then hit an unbeaten 21 to help India snatch a two-wicket victory in the seventh and final ODI at the Wankhede. The Man of the Match, though, said he was lucky at the post-match presentation ceremony. Yes it was my day. When somebody like Harbhajan (Singh) goes wicketless, you are left wondering what actually happened... I was lucky with the bat as well. I think I nicked one, Kartik confessed. The Wankhede has been Kartiks lucky ground. In the Border-Gavaskar Trophy fourth Test in November 2003-04, Kartiks seven-wicket match haul earned him the MoM award too. It (the wicket) was spinning a lot. It reminded me of the Mumbai Test. Its a special place for me. I broke a record here in an Irani Trophy match also. It has been a happy hunting ground, the left-arm spinner said. The secret of the run-chase, revealed the bowler, was staying calm. We (Zaheer Khan and he) cracked jokes to help us stay calm. We kept on telling each other that weve to get so many runs We divided the runs among ourselves, and just went for one run at a time Coming in at No. 10  with India on 143 for eight  Kartik and Zaheer (31 not out) stitched together an unbeaten stand of 52 to guide India home.

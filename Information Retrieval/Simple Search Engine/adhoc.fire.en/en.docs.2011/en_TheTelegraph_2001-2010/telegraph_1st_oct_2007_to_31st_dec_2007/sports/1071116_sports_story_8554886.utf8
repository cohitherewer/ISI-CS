 Warne, Murali patch it up 
A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan Calcutta/Melbourne: After a shrill war of words in which Muttiah Muralidharan called Shane Warne a miserable man, the two spin wizards on Thursday patched up at the unveiling ceremony of the Warne-Muralidharan Trophy, describing the entire episode a case of miscommunication. The controversy started after Warne, in his column for a newspaper, suggested that Muralidharans action be tested in match conditions, which infuriated the Sri Lankan. Muralidharan hit back saying that the Australian leg-spinner was a miserable man and threatened to snub Warne during the trophy unveiling ceremony. However, the two laughed off the controversy at the function in Hobart on Thursday, saying that it was nothing more than a misunderstanding. There is no issue at all. I thought he said something about my bowling action and then I said he was a miserable man, Muralidharan was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper. I spoke to Murali about it this morning so Im pretty happy actually, Im not that miserable. Ive got absolutely no issue with Murali and his action or anything like that, Warne said. Ive enjoyed having it (the world record). Im happy to pass it on to Murali. I think hell take a thousand (wickets), he added. A joint initiative of Cricket Australia and Sri Lanka Cricket, the has silver casts of Warne and Muralidharans right hands complete with cricket balls used by both men while playing for their countries, according to a CA release.

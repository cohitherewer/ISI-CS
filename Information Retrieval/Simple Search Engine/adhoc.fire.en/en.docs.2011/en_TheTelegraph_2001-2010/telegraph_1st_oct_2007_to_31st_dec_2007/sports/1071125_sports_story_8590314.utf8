 CRICKET BRIEFS 
 NZ gesture for cyclone survivors  
	 Dhaka: New Zealand will host a Twenty20 International against Bangladesh in December to raise funds for cyclone survivors in the South Asian country, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said on Saturday.  
	 The game will be played in Hamilton on December 23 during Bangladesh rsquo;s tour of New Zealand during which they are also due to play three one-day Internationals and two Tests.  
	 Cyclone Sidr struck Bangladesh last week, killing around 3,500 people and leaving thousands missing or homeless.  JSCA stadium issue 
	Ranchi: The Jharkhand High Court has directed Heavy Engineering Corporation and Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) to clarify if the proposed international cricket stadium on HEC land would host other games as well, adds Our Correspondent. 
 The court, while hearing a petition filed by HEC seeking permission to lease out land to JSCA, enquired if the stadium would be exclusively for cricket or there would be provision to host other games. 
	 The state government, represented by advocate-general S.B. Gadodia, contested HEC rsquo;s proposal to transfer land claiming that the government had preferred an appeal against an earlier order of the high court. The bench had directed the HEC then to transfer land to CISF to settle its dues with the security forces. Gadodia argued the order is already under challenge and to pass any other order with regard to transfer of land would not be judicious.  Bishop rsquo;s concern 
	New Delhi: With injuries becoming common for fast bowlers across the world, former West Indian tearaway Ian Bishop on Saturday expressed concern over the current scenario in world cricket and said pacers needed to be managed well.  
	Bishop said the Indian seam attack was good but genuine pace was not their forte. ldquo;R.P., Sreesanth, Munaf Patel, Irfan Pathan all have their strengths but there is no genuine fast bowler apart from Brett Lee. Shane Bond and Shoaib Akhtar have also cut down on their pace, rdquo; he said.  Ijaz batting coach  
	 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has appointed former Test batsman Ijaz Ahmed as the batting and fielding coach at its National Cricket Academy in Lahore. 
 Ijaz will take up his assignment from December 1 after returning from Adelaide where he has gone to play a charity match for the David Hookes Foundation.

 Dynamos pip Sultans 

Chandigarh: Riding on a late penalty stroke conversion, local favourites Chandigarh Dynamos beat former champions Hyderabad Sultans in the inaugural match of the Premier Hockey Leagues fourth edition at Sector 42 hockey stadium here on Thursday . 
Dynamos shot to the lead with Sandeep Singh (59th) converting a penalty stroke and held nerves in dying moments to emerge victorious. 
Hyderabad defender Nitin Kumar blocked a Prabhjot Singh attempt in the circle and umpire V.B. Singh had no hesitation in awarding a penalty stroke. 
Sandeep grabbed the opportunity to give his team a winning start in the prestigious tournament. 
The Hyderabad Sultans had their chances after the recess as Sardara Singh and Bikas Toppo made some smart moves but failed to sound the board. 
Earlier, both the teams played cautiously in the beginning and had an equal share of exchanges and ball possession in the first half. 
The Dynamos forced the only penalty corner of the match in the 10th minute of the first quarter, but failed to cash in on. The crowds, which had turned out in good number braving cold weather, kept cheering for their team. (PTI)

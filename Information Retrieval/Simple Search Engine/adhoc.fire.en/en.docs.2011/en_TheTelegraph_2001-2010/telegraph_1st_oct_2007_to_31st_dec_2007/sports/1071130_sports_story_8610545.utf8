 We need to bat to our potential: Kumble
 - Its good for the captain to be a bit jittery A STAFF REPORTER India Test captain Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh during practice at the Eden on Thursday. Picture by Gautam Bose Calcutta: Less than 24 hours before leading India at the Eden, where he has had much success, Anil Kumble appeared confident of wrapping up the series here. He was candid during the 30-minute press conference. The following are excerpts Q How do you see the wicket? A It seems to be a decent wicket and should play well. But it is for us to take the momentum from Kotla and ensure that we turn the screws on early. We need to bat to our potential... we should not let them off the hook as we had done in the first innings at the Kotla. Will the injuries in the Pakistan camp help the Indians? I dont think so... Ideally we should look to control what we can control. All of us are fit and raring to go... That is a good sign. How are you looking at this Test? I would love to go 2-0 up and seal the series here. Sourav Ganguly hasnt had much success at this ground... Are you looking at a bigger role for him in this Test? I dont think we can say one is successful at one ground and not successful at another... He did well in the last game, and I dont think he should change whatever he has been doing. I think his role in the team as a bowler was very important at the Kotla. I am sure he will get a bit of bowl here as well. I hope he will be more successful here than at Kotla. Will this be your last appearance at the Eden? Whenever I play a match, I think its my last appearance as then only you can give the best every time. I dont know what the itinerary holds... I can even make a comeback to one-day cricket or play Twenty20. Eden Gardens is a special venue and I might turn up for Twenty20, you never know... Sourav was successful as a bowler at the Kotla. Was he underbowled under previous captains? It all depends on the match situation. Some people think I should have bowled more during the Delhi Test. At the end of the day, the team should win. Thats the bottomline. Is Mahendra Singh Dhoni fit? I have heard about Dhonis injury through the media. According to us, Dhoni is 100 per cent fit and will start. Is Pakistan missing Inzamam-ul Haq? Pakistan are still are a good team. Inzamam had been the pillar of their middle-order. Obviously it makes a difference when someone of his stature retires. They still have some good players in their ranks They stretched the Delhi Test to five days. It was pretty close till the last day. We are aware of their strengths and weaknesses, but would like to concentrate on our strengths ahead of a crucial Test. The BCCI has interviewed Gary Kirsten for the coachs post. Would he be an ideal choice? I have played against Gary and he was a tough competitor. He was in a team that had been successful in the late 90s. His skills as a player will be an asset to the side. Are you happy with Rahul Dravids form? At the Kotla, Rahul batted well. It is just a matter of time before he goes out there and hammers a century. Last time when he played against Pakistan here, he got hundreds in both innings... I am sure that will give him a lot of confidence. Are you feeling the pressures of captaincy? Its good to be a bit jittery. You always feel a bit nervous before the start... Thats good for everyone. Once you cross the line its okay. Given Pakistans injury worries, would you say the pressure will be less this time? I would like to play against the best opposition. I wouldnt like to comment about what others think... Modern cricket is about handling pressure... Ive been around for 17 years... The external pressures are a lot more. Its tough on the players and captains. Earlier, opinions used to be confined to a room or restaurant. Nowadays they are a lot more public...

 Dilhara nails England
Colombo: Dilhara Fernando claimed a career-best six for 27 to propel Sri Lanka to a 107-run win over England in the fifth and final one-day International. England won the series 3-2. Fernando, coming into the attack as first change, produced an inspired spell to bowl out England for a paltry 204 in 29.1 overs. England were chasing a modest target after their bowlers had bundled out Sri Lanka for 211 in 48.1 overs. Middle-order batsman Chamara Silva top-scored for the hosts with a fine 73 from 109 balls that included nine boundaries. Sri Lanka were unable to defend an identical target on Wednesday, but Englands batsman struggled on Saturday against Fernando, who mixed aggression with clever variations in pace. However, it was left-armer Chaminda Vaas (2 for 36) who broke through first as Phil Mustard (one) was acrobatically caught by wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara.  (REUTERS)

 Business-like win for Regal Connection 
 STAR RACER Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs crack sprinter, Regal Connection, justified expectations by winning the 1,200m R.W.I.T.C Cup comfortably on Thursday. Jockey C. Alford rode a clever race on the Mr Mellon colt  allowing Cromwell and Exploding Wonder to call the shots till turning for home. Soon after, Alford switched Regal Connection from the rails bisecting the two leaders 250m from home for a businesslike victory. 				 										Regal Connections much talked about match race, with the likely Guineas favourite, Star Team, never happened. The Daniel David ward badly needed the run and placed a poor third.

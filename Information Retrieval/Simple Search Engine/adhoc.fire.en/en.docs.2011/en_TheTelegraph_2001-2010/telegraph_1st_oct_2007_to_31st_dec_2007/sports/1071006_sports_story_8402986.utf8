OUR CORRESPONDENTHyderabad: The on-field animosity in the ongoing series took a new turn on Friday with Mahendra Singh Dhoni bringing to the umpires notice certain remarks made by the Australian players. The incident happened during the 31st over when Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh were batting. The Team India captain walked up to umpire Steve Bucknor and protested some remark made by the Aussies. Ricky Ponting also joined in the conversation a few seconds later. A couple of players said something which was not in the right spirit... I spoke to the umpires who brought it to the Match Referees notice immediately, Dhoni said later. Dhoni, however, did not wish to disclose what was uttered. Lets leave it at that, he said. Ponting and a few others were involved in the incident, it was learnt.  On Thursday, the Australian captain had made it clear that his men were not going to take anything lying down.. That was in response to Harbhajan Singhs comments that the Australians had targeted him with vulgar and personal remarks during the Kochi one-dayer.

 Davydenko wins appeal against ATP
Shanghai: The ATP has dropped the fine of $2,000 imposed on fourth-ranked Nikolay Davydenko for lack of best effort during a 1-6, 7-5, 6-1 loss to Marin Cilic at St Petersburg last month. Davydenko, also at the centre of an ongoing investigation into unusual betting patterns during a loss to Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina at the Poland Open in August, had appealed against the fine, the ATP said on Thursday. Following an extensive review of the match between Davydenko and Cilic that included a full video analysis, it was decided that Davydenkos appeal should be upheld and the $2,000 fine rescinded, Gayle David Bradshaw, ATP executive vice-president for rules and competition, said in a statement. Davydenko has blamed his poor performance on exhaustion. With one of the heaviest annual schedules of any player, the 26-year-old Russian has said he plans to cut back next year because he feels his body is breaking down. Despite his ranking of world No.4, Davydenko has been fairly low profile. But all that changed since the ATP began investigating his loss to Arguello. Betfair, an online gambling company, voided all bets on the match after unusually large amounts were wagered on the lowly ranked Argentine throughout the contest, even after he lost the first set 6-1. Davydenko retired with an injury in the third set. Since then, several players have reported of having been approached and offered money to fix matches. (AP)

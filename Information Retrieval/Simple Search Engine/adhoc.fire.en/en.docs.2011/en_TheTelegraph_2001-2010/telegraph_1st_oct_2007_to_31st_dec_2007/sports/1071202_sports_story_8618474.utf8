 Jeev Milkha jumps into joint lead
Tokyo: Defending champion Jeev Milkha Singh is in contention for a second successive Golf Nippon Series JT Cup title after moving into joint lead with a four-under 66 in the third round here on Saturday. Jeev sank in six birdies against a couple of bogeys to take his total to seven-under 203 and share a two-stroke lead with local favourite Hiroshi Iwata, who carded a five-under 65, studded with five birdies and an eagle against two bogeys at the Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club. A couple of shots behind Jeev and Iwata was the Japanese quartet of Wen-Chong Liang (65), Hiroyuki Fujita (65), Toru Taniguchi (67) and Hirofumi Miyase (68) and Thailands Prayad Marksaeng (68).

 Kapur up to tied 12th
 Daniel Chopra during the second day of the Hong Kong Open on Friday. (Reuters) Hong Kong: A double bogey came in the way of Shiv Kapur breaking into the top 10 but the Delhi golfer was still the best among the Indians, carding a second successive three-under 67 to be tied 12th after the second round of the $ 2.25m Hong Kong Open here on Friday. Kapur sizzled with five birdies at the par-70 Hong Kong Golf Club and had it not been for a double bogey on the 14th, the Delhi-pro could well have been inside top-10. Todays 67 took Kapurs overall total to six-under 134. Kapur was sharing the 12th spot with Daniel Chopra (68) and Korean K. J. Choi (72). It was a fine show by Kapur as he completed a flawless front nine studded with a birdie on the sixth. In the last nine holes, Kapur gained a shot on the 13th before the double bogey on the 14th. He, however, did not let the setback bog him and sank in a hattrick of birdies from 16th to 18th to round off a decent day. Among other Indians in the fray, S.S.P. Chowrasia was tied for the 33rd spot after returning a 67 in the second round to take his total to four-under 136. Rahil Gangjee was at tied 63rd after carding an improved two-under 68 for a total of one-under 139. Amandeep Johls campaign ended after he missed the cut following a second successive 71 to finish with a total of two-over 142. Gaurav Ghei, who opened with a disastrous 75 on Thursday, withdrew from the tournament. At the top of the leaderboard, Swede Robert Karlsson shot a second successive 64 to jump into sole lead with a total of 12-under 128. Karlsson held a four-shot lead over second-placed Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez, who shot a 67.  (PTI)

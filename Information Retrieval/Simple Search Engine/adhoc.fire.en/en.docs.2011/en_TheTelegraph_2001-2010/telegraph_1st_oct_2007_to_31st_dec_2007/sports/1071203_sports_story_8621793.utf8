A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Kamran Akmal says staying positive helped him get his fifth century at the Eden on Sunday. This century was difficult... The wicket helped the spinners and the crowd was rooting for them. So there was a lot of pressure. Still I played a positive game, as advised the coach and the captain It helped, said Akmal. Was it the toughest of his five centuries? It was tough out there The wicket was also not playing easy and to score runs here was very satisfying Misbah was of great help He played positively. Akmal said there was no secret behind his four hundreds against India. I always think that my team needs me and I have to deliverI need to save the team. Did he have any special plan for this innings? We had planned to stay at the crease and keep the scoreboard moving We aimed to play out short sessions of 30 minutes each Did he feel he was out at the wrong time? I think I got out at the wrong time I should have played on. He felt the match was very open. Two days are still left and the wicket is not easy to bat onI think the match is very open We need to score at least 80 runs more Akmal believes Kumble will enforce the follow on if Pakistan fail to get another 59 runs. Akmal says he has improved on his keeping. I want to be a keeper-batsmen... I have spoken to my seniors and former wicketkeepers and improved on my keeping. Ive had to make some adjustments to keep against Danish Kaneria. Hopefully I will reach my peak in keeping too

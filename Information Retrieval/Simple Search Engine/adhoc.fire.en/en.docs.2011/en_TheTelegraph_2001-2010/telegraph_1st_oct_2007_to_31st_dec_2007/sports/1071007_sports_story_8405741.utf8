 Lewis takes pole in China
Giles Mole Fernando Alonso in Shanghai on Saturday Lewis Hamilton has claimed pole position for Sundays Chinese Grand Prix, and in doing so has taken another huge step towards winning the world championship. Hamilton, 22, and bidding to become the first rookie in Formula One history to win the prestigious title, had trailed Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa for the majority of the session. However, he produced a time of 1:35.908 seconds on his final lap in the third qualifying to edge out the Finn by just over a tenth of a second, with Massa settling for third and championship rival Fernando Alonso only fourth. Hamilton said: This weekends been a bit of rollercoaster and quite an emotional trip. I found out they were going to investigate the way I was behaving in the race under the safety car. I thought I was going to get a penalty for sure. Thankfully, with the team support, we pulled through it. Yesterday was a tough day. With that at the back of my mind, it was not easy to forget about something like that, not knowing if you would get your points taken away. Good decision by the FIA last night. Hamilton, who holds a 12-point lead over Alonso going into the penultimate race of the season at the Shanghai International Circuit, set the first competitive time of the session, a lap of 1:36.610secs, with just over six minutes remaining. Alonso just failed to beat that mark before Raikkonen, who had dominated all three practice sessions, narrowly surpassed Hamilton. However, Massa went three tenths quicker than the Finn to set a new benchmark of 1:36.221 and all four drivers dived into the pits before emerging for their final runs. Hamilton crossed the line first and waited anxiously as the other three contenders failed to outdo him. David Coulthard will start an excellent fifth in his Red Bull, ahead of Ralf Schumacher and teammate Mark Webber. BMW Sauber duo Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica line-up eighth and ninth, while Jenson Buttons Honda completes the Top 10.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

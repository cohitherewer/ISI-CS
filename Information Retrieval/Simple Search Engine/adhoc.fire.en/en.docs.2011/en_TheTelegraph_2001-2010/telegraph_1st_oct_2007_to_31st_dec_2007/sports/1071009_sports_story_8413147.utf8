 Giving media the slip
Calcutta: Neither Prasun Mukherjee nor Snehasish Ganguly showed the courage to take questions from the media after Mondays working committee meeting.

Assistant secretary Snehasish had private security guards of the CAB for company in his attempt to keep the journalists away.

 Alford, Darius face suspension 
 SRIMAX				 										Mysore: The Calcutta champion jockey C. Alford and the southern heavyweight trainer Darius Byramji face long suspension following an enquiry conducted by Mysore Race Club (MRC) stewards into the running and riding of the course-favourite, Echoes Of Light, in the Huntsey Gold Trophy on October 11. 				 										The expanding odds of Echoes Of Light (Alford up) and the victory of the Rashid Byramji-trained Bold Reply, who also sported the same colours, had prompted stewards to order the enquiry. 				 										The decision of the MRC stewards needs to be ratified by their counterparts in Bangalore Turf Club (BTC). And if they do so, then each of the two professionals will stand down for one year. The BTC stewards are expected to discuss the issue during the next fortnight.

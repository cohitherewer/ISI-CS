 Yusuf curbs Bengal march 
A STAFF REPORTER Yusuf Pathan Calcutta: The hard work done by Arindam Das and Anustup Majumdar went in vain with Bengal failing to cash in on the advantage against Baroda in their Ranji Trophy Super League match in Vadodara on Friday. Having resumed at 262 for two, Bengal lost their last eight wickets for just 108 before getting dismissed for 370. According to information reaching here, Baroda were 129 for three in reply at Day II stumps. Rakesh Solanki (43) and Baroda vice-captain Pinal Shah (21) were at the crease. The hosts still need another 241 runs to surpass Bengals first innings total. It was bowlers day as 11 wickets fell and 237 runs were scored in a contrast to the first days play. Off-spinner Yusuf Pathan was the wrecker-in-chief in Bengals innings, by capturing five wickets. Had we scored a few more runs, it would have been better, but even now we are in command, team manager Samir Dasgupta said from Vadodara. Bengal camp is thinking of using the three-pronged spin attack on Day III  Murtaza Lodhgar, Sourashish Lahiri and Kamal Hasan Mondal likely to bowl in tandem at least till lunch. Murtaza strained his back during the play, but is expected to be alright before Saturdays play begins. Dasgupta said Bengal would like to win the win the match with a bonus point. The wicket is behaving in a bizarre manner and it will tough for the hosts to bat in the fourth innings, he said. Arindam was dismissed in the second ball of the day without adding to his overnight 117 while partner Manoj Tiwary got out on 28. Only Kamal Hasan (28) offered some resistance as Bengals middle and lower orders failed to keep the momentum. During his 363-minute stay at the crease, Arindam faced 217 deliveries and hit 18 fours.

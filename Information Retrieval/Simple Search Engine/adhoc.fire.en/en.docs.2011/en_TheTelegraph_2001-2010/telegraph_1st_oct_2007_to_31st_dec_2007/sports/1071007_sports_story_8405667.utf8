 Big Mac encore after 26 years
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND AGENCIES John McEnroe Eindhoven: John McEnroe beat Bjorn Borg 7-6, 7-6 in a veterans tour match on Friday just over 26 years after defeating the Swede in the Wimbledon final. Both players showed all of their old magic, skill and determination in a thrilling clash with McEnroe saving set points in both sets before battling to victory. It was their first meeting on the Tour of Champions for five years after Borg, winner of 11 Grand Slams, returned to competitive action in August following a six-year absence. The greatest matches Ive ever played in my life have been against Bjorn, and I just want to say to him, welcome back to the Tour of Champions, the 48-year-old McEnroe was quoted as saying in a release. Hes a freak of nature. Hes still so fit and I was getting a little nervous at the end because its a huge crowd here and any time I play Bjorn you dont know youve won until the end. McEnroe has also expressed concern about the threat of a fully-blown gambling scandal in tennis, and the possibility that players will be found to have been making a cheap buck by taking bribes to throw matches. A number of mens players have disclosed that they have been offered money to deliberately lose, but the ATP Tour have said that they are yet to come across any evidence of corrupt professionals accepting the bribes. Im worried for tennis. Its a cheap way to make a buck. But throw them out  if players are making a living doing it, throwing matches for money, then if they get caught they should be severely punished, McEnroe said.

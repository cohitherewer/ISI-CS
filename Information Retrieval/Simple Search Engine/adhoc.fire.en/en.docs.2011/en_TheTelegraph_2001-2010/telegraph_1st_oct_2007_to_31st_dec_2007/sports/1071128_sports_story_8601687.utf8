 BCCI stooping too low: ICL
Chandigarh: The Indian Cricket League hit out at the Indian cricket board for stooping too low by luring its star player Brian Lara but claimed they were expecting the move before their Twenty20 tournament kicked off in Panchkula on November 30. We were expecting it. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) can stoop low and do this. They tried to do it earlier as well by spreading rumours that Lara was planning to join them. However, you can see he has arrived here and will be playing, ICLs top executive Ashish Kaul said. BCCI has said the door is open for Lara to join next years Indian Premier League (IPL) but the West Indies batting great would have to first snap all ties with the Essel Group-backed rebel Twenty20 extravaganza. Kaul, who is executive vice-president of the Essel Group, said that instead of blowing up millions of rupees in public money on IPL, the Indian cricket board should instead pump in money to improve the state of affairs in domestic cricket. Contrary to our aim of promoting domestic cricket by giving cricketers opportunities at that level and allowing them to play with international players, IPL will be using public money to pay big international stars. Why dont they spend this money on Ranji Trophy or C. K. Naidu Trophy or other domestic events, he questioned. He claimed that BCCI had now recognised what ICL was doing is right, which is why it is now offering money to cricketers to woo them. They failed to administer cricket in this country with transparency and now they are using every tactic to create hurdles in our event, in which they will fail miserably, Kaul said. Meanwhile, Lara remained in his five-star hotel room here and was not accessible to the media. However, many stars of the six teams playing in the Twenty20 event had a brief interaction with the media at another hotel where they have been lodged after their arrival here this evening. Former Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq and former Sri Lankan skipper Maravan Atapattu said ICL was a good development as it would provide a good platform for budding talent to hone their skills in the company of experienced players. Asked to comment on former South African opener Gary Kirsten being the likely coach of the Indian side, Inzamam said though he could not comment on what he could do for the side, he favoured whoever was appointed should be an experienced person. He also opined that if the Indian team was doing well (in the absence of a regular coach), they might as well continue like that. (PTI)

 Just 10 overs on second day

 - INDIA in australia 
Melbourne: Fresh thunderstorms played spoilsport on Friday to deny India valuable match practice here with the second day of their three-day warm-up match against Victoria producing just 10 overs. 
After a delayed start owing to wet outfield caused by Thursdays downpour, the penultimate days proceedings lasted just 45 minutes, during which India lost Sourav Ganguly (59) and reached 133 for four before rain put paid to their hopes for a good practice ahead of the Test series against Australia. 
At stumps, Dravid was unbeaten on 38 and Yuvraj Singh, hoping to retain his place in the Test XI, was giving him company on six. 
Allan Wise scalped Sourav for his fourth wicket of the match. 
Resuming on 110 for three, Sourav decided to go after the hosts. He clipped wise through the mid-wicket region and then cut him for a four before the bowler had his revenge in the same over. 
Wise pitched it on the middle stump and induced a flick from Sourav which found Aiden Blizzard at mid-wicket. 
Souravs 59 came off 99 balls and included nine hits to the fence. 
Yuvraj Singh, too, looked in trouble against Wise while Dravid was his studious circumspect self, though a straight drive of his for three stood out for its clean strike and precision in placement. 
Yuvraj was on 6 when the rain came and he was with Dravid, who was again difficult to rattle. Wise took all three wickets on the first day and he finished the second with 4 for 37. His extra height  he is 200cm tall  and the seam movement he extracted from the Junction Oval pitch made him hard to handle. 
India may not find out if their pace attack could exploit the conditions as well, if the rain continues on Saturday. They had been exploring whether the match could be extended to a fourth day but the teams media manager MV Sridhar said that was now unlikely. 
We are not extending the game, Sridhar said. If the weather holds this way there is nothing much we can do. Fortunately most of these boys are in good nick, they are coming off a long series so it is really not affecting anyone. 
The Indians, sensing that weather could play a real spoilsport in their preparation, sent their key members like Virender Sehwag to indoor nets at the MCG.

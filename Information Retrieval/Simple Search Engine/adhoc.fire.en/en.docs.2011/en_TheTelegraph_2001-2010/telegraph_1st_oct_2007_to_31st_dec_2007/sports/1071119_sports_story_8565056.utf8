 Aussies have Lankans in iron grip
 Lee bagged four for 82 Hobart: Australia led Sri Lanka by 407 runs with nine second innings wickets in hand after resisting the temptation to enforce the follow-on on Day III of the second Test at Bellerive Oval on Sunday. The Australians had the option of making the Sri Lankans bat again after bowling them out for 246  296 runs behind the home sides first innings total of 542 for five declared  but decided to give their bowlers a rest and increase their lead before a second declaration on Monday. When stumps were drawn, Australia were sitting pretty at 111 for one with opener Phil Jaques batting on 53 and captain Ricky Ponting giving him company on seven and on course to complete a series sweep after winning last weeks first Test in Brisbane by an innings and 40 runs. The Sri Lankan captain, Mahela Jayawardene, scored a superb 104 in his teams first innings and was well supported by Kumar Sangakkara, who made 57, but the rest of the batting crumbled under the relentless pressure of the Australian bowlers. Brett Lee picked up another four with his sheer pace while seamer Stuart Clark and leg-spinner Stuart MacGill finished with two wickets each and paceman Mitchell Johnson one.  (REUTERS)

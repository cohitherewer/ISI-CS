 Hamilton wants to do it on track, not any other way
 Fernando Alonso, who finished third, doesnt look a happy man carrying his trophy. (AFP) Sao Paulo: McLarens Lewis Hamilton said on Monday he wanted to win the Formula One title on the racetrack, not weeks later on appeal. It would be wrong, said the 22-year-old Briton, still suffering the effects of a heavy night out after letting the title slip from his grasp by one point in Sundays season-ending race in Brazil. For me, I want to win it on the track, he told reporters in his hotel room. You want to do it in style, you want to win the race, you want to win battling it out for the lead or something in the race. Being promoted after some people have been thrown out is not the way I want to do it. The rookie, Formula Ones first black driver and the title favourite before Sundays race, lost out to Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen after finishing seventh at Interlagos. Raikkonen won the race but the Finns first title was overshadowed by a stewards enquiry into the three cars that finished ahead of Hamilton. McLaren have said they will appeal against the stewards subsequent decision not to penalise Williams Nico Rosberg and BMW Saubers Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica for fuel temperature irregularities. The aim would be to lift Hamilton above them in the classification, securing the points he needs to become champion instead. The Briton said he would feel uncomfortable with that. It would feel weird after Kimi did such a fantastic job in the last two races, he said. He won yesterday (Sunday) and to have it taken away would be a bit cruel and probably not good for the sport. Last night was good and Ron (Dennis) did a speech and we had a great evening and sort of rounded up the whole year, he said. Late in the evening I felt it (the defeat) more for sure, its tough on everyone but theres always another year.... Im only 22, theres going to be plenty more opportunities for me to win the world championship and I have no doubt that we can do that in the future.(Reuters)kimi Factbox

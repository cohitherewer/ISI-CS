 EUROPEAN CLUB UPDATE 
 Ten Cate set to move to Chelsea  Amsterdam: Ajax coach Henk ten Cate is set to join Chelsea as an assistant. Ajax issued a statement on Monday confirming that Ten Cate was in talks with the Premier League club after weeks of speculation in the British press  fuelled by his agent  that the move was imminent. The statement added that Ten Cate and Chelsea were still to finalise personal terms. Ajax doesnt expect that will take very long, it said. Despite denying plans to leave Ajax as recently as Friday, Ten Cate will probably join Chelsea as assistant coach under Avram Grant. Ten Cates contract with Ajax was due to expire at the end of the season. But his position at the Dutch club was uncertain after Ajax was eliminated in the qualifying rounds of the Champions League and then the Uefa Cup  the first time in more than a decade that they have failed to reach the second round in Europe. Stoitchkov shown the door at Celta  Madrid: Celta Vigo coach Hristo Stoitchkov has been fired by the Spanish second-division club, reports said on Monday. Stoitchkov, who played for FC Barcelona and is widely considered Bulgarias greatest soccer player, was dismissed one day after Celta defeated visiting Xerez 3-1, Spanish National Radio and other media reported. Celta have had a slow start in the second division and lie 11th in the standings with 10 points from seven games. Former Real Madrid coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caro will replace Stoitchkov, the reports said. Uefa opens case against Dida  Nyon: Uefa opened disciplinary proceedings on Monday against Dida over an incident last week when the AC Milan goalkeeper fell to the turf claiming injury after being brushed by a Celtic fan. Uefa said it was investigating whether Dida acted according to the principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship. Uefa also opened proceedings against AC Milan for substituting Dida near the end of last Wednesdays Champions League game at Celtic Park in Glasgow. The case will be heard on Thursday. Uefa announced on Friday that it had opened proceedings against Celtic for not stopping a fan from running onto the field during the match. Levante sack coach  Madrid: Levante sacked coach Abel Resino on Monday after their 0-3 defeat away to Real Zaragoza on the weekend left them rooted to the foot of the Primera Liga. After the recent run of negative results the club have decided to change the person on the bench, Levante said in a statement on their web site. Resino replaced Juan Ramon Lopez Caro in January and steered the side away from relegation to 15th in the table last season. But they have had a poor start to the new campaign collecting just one point from their opening seven league games. A successor has not yet been named. Jol job safe at Spurs  London: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy on Sunday night signalled his faith in Martin Jol, despite the shattering blow of Fernando Torres injury-time equaliser at Liverpool. Levy was at Anfield and indicated that no change of management was imminent. There is nothing to discuss with Martin  everything is fine, he said. There are now almost two weeks until Tottenhams next game and it is understood that an unbeaten six-match run since the 1-3 defeat to Arsenal has reassured the Spurs board that Jol has the support of his players. Tottenham insiders said that Jols position was safe, although the apparent unavailability of the likes of Juande Ramos and Jose Mourinho may also be a factor. Bruces fears  Birmingham: Birmingham manager Steve Bruce believes he could be fired when Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung takes over the Premier League club. Bruce has 20 months of his contract left and had agreed to a new one in principle with the current Birmingham board. But president David Sullivan is set to sell out to Yeung, who bought 29.91 per cent of Birmingham shares on July 16 and has plans to take over the club. This could mean the end of Bruces time at the club, which he has managed since December 2001.

 2nd pathologist rules out strangulation
Kingston: A second pathologist told the inquest into the death of Bob Woolmer that he couldnt determine the cause of death of the Pakistan cricket coach who died during the World Cup in March because he had not been presented with a copy of the toxicology report. Dr Michael Pollanen, director of forensic pathology with the coroners office in Ontario, did however say on Monday that Woolmer had not been strangled, as had initially been suggested. The testimony, in the second week of an inquest into the high-profile death, contradicts a Jamaican autopsy that concluded Woolmer had been strangled. The Canadian also told coroner Patrick Murphy and the 11-member jury that he saw no signs of violence in X-rays and photos of Woolmer, who was found dead in a downtown Kingston hotel room. I have found no cause for lethal injury in this case, said Pollanen, one of at least three pathologists whose findings contradicted a report by Jamaican government pathologist Dr Ere Sheshiah. The Canadian said Sheshiah incorrectly reported the hyoid bone in Woolmers neck was broken, often a sign of manual strangulation. If the hyoid bone was broken, it would be good evidence of injury to the neck, he said. It was not broken in this case. In my view there is no foundation of physical attack or pressure on the neck. Pollanen said Sheshiah failed to follow procedure when he examined Woolmers neck. Based on the evidence, I would exclude strangulation as the cause of death, he said. He added, however, that the hyoid bone doesnt have to be fractured for strangulation to take place. When asked if he would entirely rule out strangulation, he said no. Under cross-examination by director of prosecutions Kent Pantry, Pollanen said a British pathologists finding that the 58-year-old Woolmer probably died from heart disease had not influenced him. Questioned by Pantry as to whether he had been informed that poison had been detected in Woolmers body, Pollanen said: I was aware that there had been a positive toxicology finding relating to Woolmers death. Asked to explain what the foreign substance was and his knowledge of a toxin called cypermethrin, Pollanen responded by saying: It is a form of insecticide or herbicide. Pollanen said he couldnt state what symptom cypermethrin would induce in a person, but he did say: It could weaken the body movement. According to images shown at the inquest, Woolmer had injuries on the face and neck. Pollanen agreed with Sheshiah that bleeding would be caused from the injuries. If there is bleeding in these areas, there would be a head injury, which may be caused from a fixed, hard surface, he noted, adding that the injuries could have been the result of the face coming in contact with a hard surface. The inquest to determine the cause of death is expected to end November 9.  (AGENCIES)

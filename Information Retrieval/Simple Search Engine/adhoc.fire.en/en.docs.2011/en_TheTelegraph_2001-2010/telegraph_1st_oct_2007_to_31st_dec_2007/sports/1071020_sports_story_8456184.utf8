 Mourinho favourite
Vicki HodgesJose Mourinho has emerged as the favourite to replace Steve McClaren as England coach. On Thursday, bookmakers gave the Portuguese manager odds of 7/1 to take over the helm if McClaren is sacked following Englands Euro 2008 qualifying defeat in Russia. Mourinho has returned to his home town of Setubal in Portugal since his departure from Stamford Bridge earlier this season, but is thought to want to return to coaching before the end of the campaign. While the self-proclaimed Special One has said he will not take up a post at another Premier League club before the 2008/09 term, the England job is one which could persuade the 44-year-old to make a return to English football in the near future. However, it is widely thought that Mourinho would like to return to domestic football. A close confidant of Mourinho said he sees the national side as a challenge and is willing to discuss the job. But other sources close to the Portuguese have said they are absolutely sure it is not the kind of job he wants but he would still be willing to speak to the FA.THE MAIN CONTENDERSMartin O rsquo;Neill: The man many wanted before McClaren took the job. O'Neill, 55, is turning Aston Villa round and, after successful spells at Leicester and Celtic, would be a popular choice.
 Guus Hiddink: The Dutchman, 61 next month, is highly qualified to lead England. He took both Holland (1998) and South Korea (2002) to fourth place in the World Cup finals. 
 Jose Mourinho: The ldquo;Special One rdquo; admitted a desire, in the future, to manage an international team but with his native Portugal. 
 Felipe Scolari: The 44-year-old is more likely to opt for club football in Italy. Scolari, 58, came close to replacing Sven-Goran Eriksson last year. He led Brazil in the 2002 World Cup finals, then as Portugal coach, knocked England out in 2006 finals. 
 Frank Rijkaard: An outsider and another Dutchman. The 45-year-old took Holland to the semi-finals of Euro 2000 and, since 2003, he helped Barcelona win the Champions League in 2006.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Chelsea fined
London: Chelsea have been fined 30,000 for failing to control their players during Septembers 2-0 Premier League defeat at Manchester United, the FA said on its website on Thursday. The charge, which Chelsea admitted, related to the conduct of several players towards referee Mike Dean following the dismissal of Nigerian midfielder John Obi Mikel after 32 minutes of the September 23 match for a foul on defender Patrice Evra. Assistant first team coach Steve Clarke was given a 5,000 fine after admitting a charge of using foul and abusive language. (Reuters)

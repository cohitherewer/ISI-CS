 Arjun Atwal tied 21st
Las Vegas: The bogey on the 11th hole was the lone blot in an otherwise impressive show as Arjun Atwal shot a sedate final round of three-under 69 to finished tied 21st in the Las Vegas Open here. Indian-born Swede Daniel Chopra came tied 44th after his even-par final round took his four-day tally to six-under 281. Atwal carded rounds of 68, 69, 72 and 69 for an aggregate of 278 that earned him a share of the 21st slot, along with eight others. Orlando-based Atwal began with a birdie and a string of par shots saw him take the turn at one-under. On his way back, he dropped a shot  his lone blemish  on the par-four 11th but more than atoned for by reeling off birdies on the 13th, 16th and 18th. He pocketed $36,533.34 for his effort. (PTI)

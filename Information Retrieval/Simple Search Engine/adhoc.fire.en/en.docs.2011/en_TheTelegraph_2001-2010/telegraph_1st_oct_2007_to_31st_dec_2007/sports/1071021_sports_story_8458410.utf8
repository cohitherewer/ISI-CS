 Chelsea may fine Drogba
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH Drogba Didier Drogba is facing a possible fine of 180,000 for his outspoken attack on Chelsea. The Ivorian travelled to the north-east with Chelsea on Friday after being called for a meeting with senior club officials to discuss his comments. It is understood that internal disciplinary action is being considered, which could include a fine of up to two weeks wages, while a carefully worded statement was released in which Drogba expressed his regret for speaking out. I am a Chelsea player and will be 100 per cent committed and supportive to my manager, my teammates and the club, he said. I will not be discussing my future until I meet privately with the club at the end of the season. Drogba has accused several of his teammates of deception amid the departure of manager Jose Mourinho, criticised club owner Roman Abramovich and said that he wanted to leave because something is broken at Chelsea. Real Madrid, Barcelona, AC Milan and Inter Milan are his preferred destinations, although he has now signalled his intention to stay until the end of the season. Drogba trained normally on Friday, although the atmosphere was sure to have been tense. Manager Avram Grant refused to comment on what he called internal business.

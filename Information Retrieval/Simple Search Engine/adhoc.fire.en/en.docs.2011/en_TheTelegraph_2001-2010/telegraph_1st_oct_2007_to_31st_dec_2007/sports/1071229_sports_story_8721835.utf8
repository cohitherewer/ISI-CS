 Ready to give our best, says Sania

Perth: The Indian team of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna begin their Hopman Cup campaign against former champions and second seeds United States in the 20th edition of the prestigious mixed team event starting here on Saturday. 
While Sania is pitted against Meghann Shaugnessy, Bopanna takes on Mardy Fish in their singles ties before the mixed doubles match. 
Fish, an Australian Open quarterfinalist, is ranked as high as 39 against Bopannas 267 on the ATP rankings. Both the players are yet to play against each other. 
Sania, however, got a bit of a reprieve after her original opponent, Australian Open champion Serena Williams, was replaced by Shaugnessy for this tie. 
Shaugnessy is 21 rungs below Sania at 52 on the WTA charts but she has been successful in overhauling the Indian twice in their three meetings so far. 
Sania, making a comeback after an abdominal strain cut short her season-ending campaign, was oozing confidence ahead of the eight-team tournament. 
We have a very tough draw, having been pitted with the USA, Australia and Czech Republic. But Rohan and I are ready to give it our best shot, Sania said before leaving for the tournament. 
The Indian team, seeded seventh, has been given a direct entry as reward for their good show in the previous edition of the mixed team event. Sania and Bopanna had upset Croatia and Czech Republic before losing to Spain last year. 
After the tough tie against the United States, India will take on Australia, comprising Alicia Molik and Peter Luczak, and Czech Republic  represented by Tomas Berdych and Lucie Safarova  on January 1 and 3, respectively. 
The group A comprises Serbia, France, Argentina and Chinese Taipei, the winners of Asian Hopman Cup. 
The four teams in each group will play in a round-robin format and the winners will advance to the final. Serbia, with world No. 3 Novak Djokovic and Jelena Jankovic, are top seeds in the tournament. (PTI)

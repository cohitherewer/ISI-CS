 Testing time for CAB president
	 - Snehasishs Todi links set to be an issue; Paul in Chandigarh as observer A STAFF REPORTER UNDER PRESSURE: Prasun Mukherjee (top) and Snehasish Ganguly Calcutta: For the past few days, Prasun Mukherjee has been under pressure to keep the police commissioners chair. On Monday, when the Cricket Association of Bengals working committee meets, he may find the going hot there too. Former assistant secretary Biswarup Dey has, in a letter, already asked Mukherjee not to preside over the meeting in the light of the recent developments related to Rizwanur Rahmans death. According to joint secretary Amitava Banerjee, Mukherjee will chair Mondays meeting. Working committee meetings are generally held with a fixed agenda. However, other issues can be raised under the miscellaneous head after due permission from the chair, Banerjee said. There has been talk of moving a no confidence motion against the president but according to the constitution there is no provision for it. Amazingly, another joint secretary Samar Paul is in Chandigarh, as an observer for Mondays ODI versus Australia. Assistant secretary Snehasish Gangulys role will also come under the scanner. There has been growing pressure from a section of the members for his resignation. Snehasish has conceded to having introduced Pradip Todi, younger brother of Ashok, to the police chief. He is also a director in their company. It may be recalled that police had raided Todis Burrabazar office in 2002 and arrested four persons in connection with a betting racket. Three computers and eight mobile phones were seized. Todi was interrogated by officers of the anti-rowdy section but was let-off. Till late on Sunday, Snehasish neither took calls nor responded to text messages from The Telegraph seeking details of when he got involved with Todi. If Snehasishs Todi links do go back to 2002, then the wisdom of his continuing to have business ties with Todi is bound to raise eyebrows as younger brother Sourav was then the Team India captain. Late on Sunday, Mukherjee visited Chandi Ganguly at his residence in Behala. Besides being the father of Snehasish and Sourav, he is also the chairman of the Board of Trustees at the CAB. There have been several instances of officials having to quit because of links with bookmakers. Thilanga Sumathipala of Sri Lanka Cricket couldnt attend an International Cricket Council meeting because of his familys connection with the bookmakers. Another official, Charat Ram, won elections in the West Indies board but had to resign because of his familys links with bookmakers. At the meeting on Monday, there will also be opposition to the removal of Barun Burman and Kalyan Chowdhury as senior selectors. Bengal have been Ranji Trophy runners-up for the past two seasons and the selectors role have come in for praise. Raja Venkat, a Mukherjee confidant who had contested unsuccessfully for the joint secretarys post last year and Jaidip Mukherjee, who is close to the Gangulys, are being considered as replacements. There is also a move to promote Venkat to the national selection committee next year. Burman is likely to be made chairman of the junior selection committee. Another issue that may turn contentious is M.K. Sens nomination as chairman of the tour committee. According to the rules, only working committee members can head the sub committees, and Sen is not a member. Any mistake will be rectified The minutes of the meeting where he was made chairman havent been confirmed yet. So we can always look into it, the joint secretary said.

 Im on an amazing run, says Federer 
 Roger Federer with the trophy after finishing 2007 as the No. 1 player, in Shanghai on Tuesday. (Reuters) Shanghai: Roger Federer was honoured in Shanghai on Tuesday after finishing the year as the worlds top player for the fourth season in a row. The Swiss was assured of finishing 2007 ahead of Spanish rival Rafael Nadal in the ATP Tours Champions Race after winning his hometown title in Basel at the end of last month. Federer, still licking his wounds after Mondays shock defeat by Chiles Fernando Gonzalez in his opening round-robin match at the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, paid tribute to Nadal. This year was very special because I was behind Nadal and won it back, said Federer in an on-court ceremony before the Spaniards match against compatriot David Ferrer. Its the fourth consecutive year for me to finish as number one. Its an amazing run Im on and Ill try my best to maintain it in 2008.  (REUTERS)

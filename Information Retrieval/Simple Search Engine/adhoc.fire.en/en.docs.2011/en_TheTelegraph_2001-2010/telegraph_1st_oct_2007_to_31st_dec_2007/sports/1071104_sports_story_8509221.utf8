 Keeping cool the key: Praveen
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Praveen Kumars way of showing aggression is a far cry from Sreesanths over the top variety. Praveen believes in being calm and composed and doing things his own way. Perhaps he has taken a cue from his idol, Amitabh Bachchan  Mujhe jo sahi lagta hai woh mein karta hoon, phir chahe woh bhagwaan ke khilaaf ho, samaaj ke, police, kanoon ya pure system ke khilaaf (I do whatever I think is fine be it against God, society, police or the entire system), greets a person calling his cellphone, summing up the rookie medium pacers attitude. I dont want to follow anybody Ive my style and Im confident with it Maybe Sreesanth is good with his aggression but, for me, keeping cool is the key, the 21-year-old told The Telegraph. He made it into Team India after his stellar showing in the Challenger Trophy, taking nine wickets for India Red. The Meerut lad had his first brush with the circus that surrounds cricket in this country when he fell from an open jeep during a reception in his hometown. I fell down after a push from the back I fainted It was a shocking but a good experience. I was really overwhelmed with the reception, the people could not control their excitement that day. Cricket in India is big and people go mad after you make it. Next time, Ill be more careful, he said. Making it to the squad for a series against arch-rivals Pakistan is always big. It will be a great feeling to make ones debut against Pakistan It would be a dream to play against them I will have to stick to basics. Its always going to be a pressure series. I never thought that the Challenger would give me this break but ummid pe toh duniya kayam hai Aap logon ka dua ho, toh mein aage jaoonga, he said.

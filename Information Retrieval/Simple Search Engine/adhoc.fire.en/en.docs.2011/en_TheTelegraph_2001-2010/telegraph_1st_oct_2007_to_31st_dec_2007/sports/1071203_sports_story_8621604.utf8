 Bengal on top
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTSiliguri: Openers Anustup Majumdar (99) and Arindam Das (93 batting) helped Bengal consolidate their position in the Ranji Trophy match against Punjab at the Kanchenjungha Stadium here on Sunday. After dismissing Punjab for 241 on the second morning, Bengal reached 231 for one at close. Anustup and Arindam have virtually ensured that Bengal will get the first-innings lead, which will fetch them at least three crucial points from this Super League fixture. We are in a good position and our target is to get at least a 200-run lead, said coach Bharat Arun. If we can achieve that, we can put extra pressure on them. The Punjab tail could add only 31 runs on Sunday morning. Ashok Dinda picked two more to finish with four for 42, while Ranadeb Bose took the other to return figures of three for 56. The Bengal openers then put on 194 in 274 minutes to put their team firmly in the drivers seat. The only disappointment was Anustup missing out on his second century of the season by one run.

 Suresh, Paul doubtful 
 - I-League East Bengal cautious vs Rookie Kerala outfit A STAFF REPORTER Subrata Bhattacharya explains a point to Dipendu Biswas and McDonald Mukansi at practice on Saturday, the eve of East Bengals I-League opener vs Viva Kerala. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Having lost the Sahara CFL Premier Division title to Mohun Bagan recently, East Bengal are determined to launch their I-League (erstwhile National Football League) campaign in style against Viva Kerala at the Barasat stadium on Sunday.  We have to win tomorrow there is no other option for us after a disappointing finish in the CFL, Subrata Bhattacharya said after Saturdays training session. A win will not only boost confidence, it will help eliminate problems in the team. If the East Bengal coach is to be believed, the former NFL champions are not taking Viva Kerala  who earned promotion to the elite division this season  lightly. We saw them a little in the Federation Cup Cant take them lightlyThey also have three foreigners, Bhattacharya said. East Bengal may have to take the field without defender M. Suresh and goalkeeper Subrata Paul as both are on the injury list. South African recruit McDonald Mukansi will partner Brazilian Edmilson Marques up front. Despite being up against a new team, the red-and-golds are cautious if not worried. We will see how things go in the first 15-20 minutes and then take it from there, Bhattacharya said. The East Bengal coach said he was aware that their opponents have a pattern which matches Bengals style. They have a gharana and are no less than any other team playing in the I-League. Viva Kerala coach A.M. Sreedharan said he knew the task is cut out for his boys. We have to play all big teams, so its better to play them at the start, he said. Viva Kerala did well to reach the last eight of the Federation Cup in Ludhiana, where they lost to Mohun Bagan. Of the three foreigners  Wisdom Abbey, Baba Tunde and A. Avadu  the first named could trouble the local giant. Abbey, a struiker, played for Ghana in the under-17 and under-19 World Cup meets. All 10 teams have a lot to play for, with a substantial hike in the prize money of the new-look club championship. The winners will be richer by Rs 50 lakh, an increase of 10 lakh. The runners-up will get Rs 28 lakh  up 6 lakh. The winners of each match will pocket Rs 35,000.

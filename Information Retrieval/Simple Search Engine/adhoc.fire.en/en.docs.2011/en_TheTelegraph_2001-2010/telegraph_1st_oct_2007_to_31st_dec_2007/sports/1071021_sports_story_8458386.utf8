 Atwal cards 1-under 71
Tennessee: Arjun Atwals hopes to make the cut for weekend action hangs in balance after the Orlando-based Indian carded a second round of one-under 71 in the Chattanooga Classic on the Nationwide Tour. Atwals two-day total of three-under 141 put him just outside the cut line before darkness drew early curtains on the proceedings and his prospect of making the cut would depend on how some of other players who could not finish their round, fare on Saturday. In case Atwal misses the cut, it would be a severe jolt to his hopes to secure the PGA Tour card for the next season. Currently ranked 57 in the money order, Atwal desperately needs good result here to play two more events on the Nationwide Tour and finish inside top 25 to obtain his 2008 PGA Tour card. Early setbacks ruined Atwals second round card and a late charge was of no avail. Playing his back nine first, Atwal got off to the worst possible start that came in the form of a bogey hattrick. Back-to-back birdies on the 14th and 15th was a damage control exercise but on the 18th and then again on the second, he dropped two more shots to find himself in a morass. To his credit, Atwal reeled off four birdies in a space of five holes  from fourth to eighth  and then parred the ninth but that may not be enough to hang around for the weekend action. Scott Sterling shot five-under 67 to join overnight leader Tad Ridings (69) at 13-under 131 for a two-shot lead over a pack of four. In Vilamoura, Jeev Milkha Singh raised his game by a few notches to produce a bogey-free second round of five-under 67 and join compatriot Shiv Kapur at tied 19th after the halfway stage in the Portugal Masters. Kapur, who had kicked off his campaign with an impressive opening round of 67, carded two-under 70 to total seven-under 137 . Jeev, a 10th tee starter, was precise in his second round and had 16 greens in regulation. (PTI)

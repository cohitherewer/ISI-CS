 Good toss to lose, says Dhoni
- A STYLISH STATEMENT
OUR CORRESPONDENTKanpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni was his usual chirpy self on Sunday. The sense of relief was palpable. A victory at the Green Park had ensured India would stay alive in the series till the final match in Jaipur. We definitely enjoy an advantage in the remainder of the series. Being 2-1 up breeds confidence. We have the upper hand now. The last two matches are day-night encounters where the dew will play a big part. The toss will be vital since things tend to get easier batting second, said the Team India captain. Dhoni admitted that it was a good toss to lose. Things were a bit confusing. Generally the pitch at the Green Park helps pacers in the first hour or so and then tends to aid the spinners. We had decided to bowl in case I won the toss At the same time we also knew well that the spinners would come into the fray as the day wore on. While Shoaib Malik is feeling the heat for choosing to bowl, Dhoni can sit back and relax for now. He felt things went according to Indias plan on Sunday. We needed to capitalise on a good start and did just that. While the emphasis is always on a good start, the period between the 30th and 40th overs are equally important. Building a quick partnership is essential. That is very important for any side anywhere in the world. Thankfully Yuvraj (Singh) and myself got things moving in the right direction during that phase. I was also happy with the way Harbhajan (Singh) and Yuvraj bowled in the middle overs. Dhoni said Pakistan did bat well in patches but never threatened to snatch win from India. I dont think the match was too close at any stage. The wicket was doing a bit and it was difficult to bat. He was all praise for Yuvraj Singh. Its a pleasure to have someone like Yuvraj in the team. He takes responsibility and handles pressure well. He is always forthcoming in a crisis. He rotates the strike intelligently and knows when best to attack. He is the right man at No.4.

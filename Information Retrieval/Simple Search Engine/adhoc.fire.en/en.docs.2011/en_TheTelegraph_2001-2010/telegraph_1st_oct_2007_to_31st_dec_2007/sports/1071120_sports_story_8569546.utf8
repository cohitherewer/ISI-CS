 Gaekwad, More flay BCCI
Vadodara: Former BCCI selection committee chairman Kiran More and Aunshuman Gaekwad have come down heavily on the BCCI for issuing guidelines for selectors. It was wrong to put such restrictions on selectors. If BCCI office bearers including its secretary Niranjan Shah, vice-president Lalit Modi and others could go to dressing room or abroad then why the selectors should not be permitted to write columns in the newspapers, More said. Former Test player Gaekwad said there must be a reason behind BCCI imposing such restrictions. He said he was not aware of details about the guidelines but was of the view why Board thought of such action. Aunshumans father and former Indian skipper D.K. Gaekwad agreed there is no need for the selectors to visit the dressing room during the match.  The selectors have also been asked to watch the players in domestic matches as they would not be sent on the foreign tours as per the new guidelines of the Board.  (PTI)

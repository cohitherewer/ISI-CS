 Symonds warns Indians of backlash Down Under
 - Well see how the so-called new Indian team performs on our soil, says Australian allrounder  Andrew Symonds in Nagpur on Sunday Melbourne: Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds has added fuel to his simmering duel with Indians by describing the ongoing tour as hostile and warning the team of a backlash when it tours Down Under this year. Symonds, who is engaged in a war of words with the hosts since the seven-match series began, said he knew India was never an easy place to tour, but I am surprised how hostile it has been. The allrounder, on his fifth tour of India, said the World Twenty20 champions still had a lot to prove and were set for a searing summer in Australia. Theyre saying theyve built up this new Indian team, but well see how much theyve changed at the end of our summer, he told an Australian daily. We have had the edge on them here and we will get them again in Australia. Theyve beaten us in a Twenty20 game and one one-dayer in four years. You cant gauge much from that, but well see how this so-called new Indian team performs on our soil, he said. On the crowd making monkey chants at him during the fifth ODI in Vadodara, he said: I dont know what is going to transpire from what happened to me the other day. I am a pretty liberal sort of bloke. But racism is a big issue in world sport, not just cricket. It is a sensitive issue, but what do you do in this instance if its coming from the crowd? Im not allowed to comment on exactly what went on, but Im not the most deadly serious bloke. Life goes on. Symonds also said fast bowler Sreesanth was frequently overstepping the mark of gamesmanship. It is fair to say there is not a lot of love between us and Sreesanth. His carry-on in this series has been way over the top. We dont mind blokes having a go and standing up for themselves, but he has gone above and beyond whats acceptable. Its one thing to play hard and use gamesmanship, another to overstep the mark and thats what has happened on more than one occasion with him. Symonds said India may have some world class players but a teams success depended on how they gelled together. Theyve got some world-class players but its how they gel together thats important. As soon as we spot one sign of weakness or selfishness, we go in for the kill. You dont become a great player overnight and its the same as a team: you need sustained success to be respected. When other sides say youre a great side, thats when youre a great side, he said. Symonds said he was not impressed with Indian cricketers behaviour. We are not overly social with the Indian team, but I get on well with most of them... There are just a couple of them who seem to spark things. Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh are the ones we are clashing with most. The thing that annoys us the most is when they are going well, they will have a shot at you. But when they arent going well, they forget to shake hands at the end of the game. Symonds also did not hide his irritation to see Indian cricketers in television commercials everyday. Two days before our first game, the Indian players didnt train because their guys were shooting commercials. Its been irritating because its been in our face. We see them on television every day. Meanwhile, Australian media claimed on Sunday that Symonds has been subjected to racial abuse in Nagpur as well. According to a Melbourne daily, Symonds was again subject to monkey chants.  (PTI)

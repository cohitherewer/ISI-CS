 He has kept growing as the perfect icon: Rameez
 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
 -  Former Pakistan captain, who figured in Sachins debut series, offers his salute LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHIVadodara: Rameez Raja was in the Pakistan XI when Sachin Tendulkar made his ODI debut, in Gujranwala, almost 18 years ago. The match was reduced to 16 overs for each team and the hosts won by seven runs. Rameez scored 10, while believe it or not, Sachin failed to get off the mark. A former captain and chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Rameez (here on a TV assignment) spoke to The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. The following are excerpts On whether he remembers that Gujranwala ODI Frankly, no... Eighteen years is a long time... On his first impression of Sachin (Grins) That he was short in stature and didnt have an imposing figure... However, before the Test series (which preceded the ODIs) began, I remember Kapil Dev cautioning us that we shouldnt go by Sachins age and height... That he actually possessed a superb cricket brain. Well, Kapil was right. On Sachins performances in the lead-up to his ODI debut He did pretty well in the Test series and had shown courage in Sialkot by not going off despite getting hit on the nose... Then, hed hammered Abdul Qadir in what got reduced to an exhibition match in Peshawar... That confirmed he was special... I found him very involved and, really, he seemed to straightaway belong to the stage... (After a pause) That, as a bowler, he could swing the ball became known during his debut (Karachi) Test... So much so that I had to give him respect. On Sachin being hours away from his 400th ODI appearance Its a mind-boggling number... On Sachin over the past 18 years He has been a great ambassador for the game... Indeed, Sachin has always been politically correct and has never said anything to start a controversy... On the field, he has been busy making runs and, off it, has kept growing as the perfect icon... After four-five years, success can get to ones head, but Sachin hasnt changed in as many as 18... Thats why hes respected by the opposition and teammates hold him in awe... Sachin, in turn, has given the game respect and is still probably overawed by it. On Sachin as a role model Theres so much to learn from him... His dedication, his love for cricket... Even after so many years, that want to do well is there... The hunger to succeed hasnt lessened... That he has never lowered his intensity is remarkable. As is the fact that Sachin hasnt ever had a slump... Finally, on Sachins future as a one-day cricketer Its something he has to decide and decide fast... My personal view is that youngsters must be encouraged both in ODIs and Twenty20... Of course, Sachin has kept pace with the game, has grown with it... Has the ability to adapt beautifully, but hes 34-plus and should decide whether he ought to only focus on the biggest stage  Test cricket. The balls in his court.

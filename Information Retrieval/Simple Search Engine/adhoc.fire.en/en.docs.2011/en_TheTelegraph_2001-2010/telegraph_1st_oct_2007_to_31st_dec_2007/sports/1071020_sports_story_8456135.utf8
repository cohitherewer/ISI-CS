 SA to stay in Pak despite blasts
Lahore: South Africa will continue their tour of Pakistan despite the blasts on Thursday that killed 133 people in a rally for former premier Benazir Bhutto in Karachi. South Africas manager Logan Naidoo told a news conference that the team were satisfied with security arrangements for them, but reserved the right to review the situation if needed. We are satisfied so far. The security arrangements put in place are pleasing and acceptable to the Sou- th African team, Naidoo said. So we will definitely continue the tour, but we will be keeping tabs on what is happening in the country for rest of the tour. If anything changes, we will meet again with the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) and security officials and reassess our position and then we will make a decision if anything has to be changed. Sources in the Pakistan board said there was a possibility of South Africa wanting the final one-day International at Karachi on October 29 shifted to another venue. The sources said South Africa, who have four more one-day games in Lahore (October 20), Faisalabad (October 23), Multan (October 26) and Karachi wanted the last match shifted to Lahore.  (REUTERS)

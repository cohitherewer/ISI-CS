 Soccers loss is F1s gain 
Patrick Nathanson Lewis Hamilton is flanked by England football captain John Terry and former England rugby player Martin Johnson during an NFL game at Wembley recently. (Reuters) Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton said he considered a career in professional football as a teenager. I think I would have been a footballer if I hadnt become a driver, said Hamilton. I had more pace than Ashley Young at the time  I was bigger than him  but he was more skilful. I havent spoke to Ashley since I left school but Ive got friends who are in touch with him and Ive sent messages along. Hamiltons competitive streak made him a combative football player. I was a midfielder and I could go into a tackle so hard that I risked breaking my leg. Im very, very competitive in everything. I honestly dont know where I get it from. However, his natural sporting talents extended beyond the football pitch. I played for the school cricket team, the basketball team, the footy team, he said. I was on the athletics team and I did javelin, discus and the 800m and won the occasional event on school sports days. Hamilton now nurtures a passion for music and is a budding guitarist. I sit in my room at all the races now and play my guitar, he said. Im not fantastic  I just play a bit of rock, a bit of jazz, just stuff that keeps me going. Despite missing out on the drivers championship by a single point, Hamilton was delighted with his first season in Formula One. Overall it was a fantastic season. I had so much to learn in such a short period of time, it was a great experience for me. Im ranked No. 2 in the world and thats pretty good in the world. It exceeded my expectations.

 More grass meets will boost game: Ashutosh

A STAFF REPORTER
Calcutta: Reigning national champion Ashutosh Singh feels that there should be more grass court tennis tournaments to boost the growth of the sport in the country. 
According to the 25-year old Delhi player, more such tournaments would help expose fresh talent and improve the game in the country. 
Calling the national tournament a great opportunity for the participants, Ashutosh said: Its a prestigious tournament and a great opportunity for everybody to show off their skills. 
But I feel that more grass court tournaments should be organised This will help in exposing the talent and the growth of the sport, he told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the IndianOil Servo National Grass Court Tennis Championship qualifying matches at the South Club on Sunday afternoon. 
Ashutosh was the losing finalist in the $10,000 ITF mens Futures tournament in Lahore last month and is hopeful that he will perform well here. 
It was a good tournament in Pakistan But I am hopeful of a good performance here I will be little cautious while playing my first game as the first game always turns out to be a tricky one I will play one match at a time, he said. 
And there is an obvious incentive  the winner here will get a wild card into the Chennai Open that begins at the end of the month. 
 Obviously thats a great incentive for us I am eager to grab it, said the lanky player. 
Talking about the courts, Ashutosh said: Its one of the best courts in the country I practised for about twenty minutes in the morning and feel that its nice and quite fast It will be a nice tournament 
Divij Saran, however said that was some bad bounce. I like playing on grass courtsI played here seven years ago, but on the clay courts Saran said. 
There is some bad bounce I feel thats because the grass is bit long, he added. 
For Vivek Shokeen this will be a tough tournament. Besides Ashutosh and Divij, Harsh Mankad and Karan Rastogi are also in the fray. It will be a tough tournament With Harsh and Karan in the line-up, things will really turn out to be interesting, he said. 
Womens top seed Rushmi Chakravarthy appeared confident and, along with Sonal Padke and Parul Goswami, believes the meet will be a competitive one. 
Meanwhile, Anshuman Dutta of Assam and Divyanshu Singh of Delhi qualified for the mens singles main draw.

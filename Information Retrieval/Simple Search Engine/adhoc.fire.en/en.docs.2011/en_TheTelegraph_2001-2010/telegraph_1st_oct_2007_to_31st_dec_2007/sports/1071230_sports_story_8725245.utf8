 Eye on survival, not on summit

Calcutta: It will be a battle with a difference when Mohun Bagan and East Bengal clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. For a change, both former three-time champions will have an eye on survival rather than the summit. 
Unlike the seasons three previous derby duels, the sparks are not flying this time around. Both camps are uncharacteristically subdued, no doubt influenced by the position they are in right now. 
Mohun Bagan, with eight points, are a point ahead of their city rivals going into the eighth-round clash of the ONGC I-League. With Dempo and JCT leading the standings (18 points each), the Calcutta giants will basically try to consolidate their position at the middle of the table. 
East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya is facing a defence-related problem with Kenyan Julius Ohinos ITC coming too late for him to be eligible for the Sunday contest. 
Ohino was very much part of my strategy. We committed some silly mistakes in the rearguard in our previous matches and the Kenyans availability would have plugged the holes to some extent, Bhattacharya said on Saturday. 
The red-and-golds will be strengthened by Surkumar Singhs return in the right back position, but Muttiah Suresh and McDonald Mukansi will sit out with injuries. Anupam Sarkar will pair with M. Bolaji in deep defence. 
Bhattacharya, a former India defender and veteran of countless derbies, is not sure if such a makeshift back line will be able to counter rival captain Bhaichung Bhutias predatory skills. 
Running through Bhattacharyas minds were images of the 1974 Durand Cup when he and Nimai Goswami thwarted the star-studded East Bengal line-up. Ulganathan scored the winner in that semi-final clash and went on to smash a hattrick against JCT to help Mohun Bagan lift the title. 
Bhattacharya, after Saturdays practice, urged his players to show similar resilience. Derbies may have undergone a sea-change since my days but the passion and pride of playing such matches remain the same. I need the same passion in my boys tomorrow, he said. 
Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira may not have any serious worry over players availability, but his self-created mystery over Jose Ramirez Barreto could be a ploy to exploit East Bengals fragmented defence. 
The Brazilian playmakers presence during practice was limited only to some running and spending a few minutes with the coach. Neither Pereira nor Bhaichung revealed anything concrete on Barreto playing on Sunday, though he looked to have recovered from his hamstring injury. 
Im not thinking about any individual player. To me, Mohun Bagan will play against East Bengal. The team is in an upbeat mood and the players know a win tomorrow will help us turn things around, Pereira pointed out. 
Although the Mohun Bagan have conceded 14 goals in seven matches, the Brazilian coach stood by his defenders. He stressed on the importance of the midfielders firing. 
In the absence of Alvito DCunha, East Bengal also need viable alternatives. Mehtab Hussain could be one of the solutions. Hes far from the scintillating form he was in last season (in Mohun Bagan colours). 
The remodelled National League has thrown up cut-throat competition, and both teams have been found wanting in producing that sharp edge needed to challenge the Goan rivals. 
Bhattacharyas reliance on history or Carloss mystery over Barreto notwithstanding, Sunday will see the Big Two launch mission redemption.

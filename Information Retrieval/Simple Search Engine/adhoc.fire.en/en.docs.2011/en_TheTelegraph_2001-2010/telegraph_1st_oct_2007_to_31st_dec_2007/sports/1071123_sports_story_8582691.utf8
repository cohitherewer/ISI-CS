 ... Likely to be compensated
 - Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar to stop writing columns but... LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Dilip Vengsarkar New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has, for the past few days, been inviting egg on its face. If the controversy over Shah Rukh Khan wasnt bad enough, with officials taking such diverse stands, the BCCI mishandled the Dilip Vengsarkar affair too. It doesnt seem to learn. Clearly, at the end of the day, the drama over the chief selectors columns was wholly uncalled for. According to The Telegraphs sources, Vengsarkar will stop his columns, but is likely to be compensated for the monetary loss hes going to suffer. The chief selector wont, of course, be humiliated by being asked to show cause why action shouldnt be taken for violating guidelines by continuing to write. The national selectors still work in an honorary capacity. Significantly, Sunil Gavaskar (BCCIs technical committee chairman) and Ravi Shastri (National Cricket Academy chairman) write regularly and, on Thursday, newest Test captain Anil Kumble also became a columnist! Vengsarkar, obviously, isnt happy with the BCCIs double standards. The compensation bit apart, the BCCI may rescind its decision of not allowing selectors to travel overseas with Team India. Ironically, this practice had been started by the present regime, headed by Sharad Pawar. An announcement could be made on Friday, the day after Pawars meeting with Vengsarkar at the Kotla. The chief selector declined to say anything (a gag order is in place), but recent happenings have upset him. The BCCI, in fact, has insulted Vengsarkar  a former captain, mind you  by forbidding him to interact with the media in his capacity as chief selector. Its to be seen whether theres a quick rethink.

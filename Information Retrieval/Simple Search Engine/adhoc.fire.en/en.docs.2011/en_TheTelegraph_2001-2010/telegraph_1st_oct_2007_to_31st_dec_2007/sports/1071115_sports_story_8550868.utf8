 Butt still feels the heat
OUR CORRESPONDENTGwalior: Salman Butt is feeling the pressure despite scoring a century against India during the third ODI in Kanpur. That he did not rotate the strike enough in the middle overs when the spinners were on has been criticised. There was need for acceleration and he hadnt been able to do justice to the teams cause. Butt, though, is not willing to get involved in any controversy. Dont wish to make a comment on that innings It ended in a losing cause, Butt told The Telegraph on Thursday. Butt, whose all four centuries have come against India, maintains that his best is yet to come. I have played some good knocks but havent really played one that I can say has stood out. The opener maintained that he hadnt been stripped of vice-captaincy. I gave it up to concentrate on my batting. I have age on my side and those things will happen later, he said. Perhaps the next two one-dayers could be his chance to make amends.

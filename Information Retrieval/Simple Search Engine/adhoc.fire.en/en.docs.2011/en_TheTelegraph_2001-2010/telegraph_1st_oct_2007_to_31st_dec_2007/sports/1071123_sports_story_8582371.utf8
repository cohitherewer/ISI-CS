 Federer masters Sampras again
Kuala Lumpur: World No. 1 Roger Federer defeated retired US legend Pete Sampras for the second straight time in three days at an exhibition match in Kuala Lumpur. Both held serve to take the first set to a tiebreak with the Swiss maestro inching ahead when Sampras hit a forehand into the net. It was a similar affair in the second set, which also went to a tiebreak before Federer dug deep to run out eventual winner 7-5. The two met only once on the ATP Tour, in the fourth round of Wimbledon in 2001 when Federer defeated the American in five sets. Federer won the first match played in Seoul on Tuesday, beating the former world No. 1 6-4, 6-3 in 61 minutes. (AFP)

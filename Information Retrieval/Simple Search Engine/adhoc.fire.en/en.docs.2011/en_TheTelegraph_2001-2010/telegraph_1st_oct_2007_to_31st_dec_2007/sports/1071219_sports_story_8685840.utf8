 Hamiltons licence suspended 

Paris: Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton had his drivers licence suspended for a month in France after he was caught speeding by police. 
Hamilton was clocked going at 196kmph in a Mercedes on the A26 highway near the northern town of Laon on Sunday night, police spokesman Arnaud Dujardin said Tuesday. 
He (Hamilton) recognised the infraction he had committed straight away, Dujardin said by telephone. He was very courteous. The police officers then took him back to his hotel. 
Hamiltons car was taken away by police and picked up by a friend of the British racing star on Monday. Dujardin said the police officers did not recognise Hamilton, who was alone in the car, until they looked at his identification papers. 
They did not know it was him. All they saw was a car going too fast, Dujardin said, adding that Hamilton is banned from driving on French roads for one month. 
He no longer has a permit on national territory, Dujardin said. He cannot drive in France, although I dont know whether that applies to (England). 
The 22-year-old McLaren driver led the world championship standings for much of his rookie season but finished runner-up, one point behind Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen. Hamilton won four races.

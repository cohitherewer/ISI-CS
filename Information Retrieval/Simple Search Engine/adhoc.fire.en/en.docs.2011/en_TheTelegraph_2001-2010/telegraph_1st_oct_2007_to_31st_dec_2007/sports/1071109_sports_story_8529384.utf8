 Dhoni blames bowlers
 - Mom Younis dedicates hundred to Woolmer after Pakistan level series 1-1 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Sachin Tendulkar on way to his 99 in Mohali on Thursday. (AFP) Mohali: Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Thursday that he expected the bowlers to do a better job in the second one-dayer against Pakistan. While admitting that a slump in the scoring rate in the middle overs left India short by at least 15 to 20 runs, Dhoni said: Still our bowlers could have contained the Pakistani batsmen. I expected them to do a better job. The Indian captain pointed out that Sourav Ganguly did a good job as part time bowler. Sourav did a good job. He never looked like a part time bowler. I thought this total would be enough to win the match. The problem was that we had a slump in the middle overs, said Dhoni. Both Sachin (Tendulkar) and Gautam (Gambhir) were out in quick succession. I also got out badly. Had we not lost those wickets, we could have reached 340. That would have won the match for us, Dhoni said. The wicketkeeper captain sounded philosophical when he said that a victory or defeat was part of cricket. There is always life beyond the ground. That day we won and celebrated. Today we lost, we are sad. It happens in the game of cricket. We have to live with it. So whats the point in getting into the blame game? Man of the match, Younis Khan said he never thought 321 was a tall score. I was always confident of chasing it. I knew if three or four of us can stick around, then it wont be any problem. It happened the same way. Younis dedicated his century to former coach Bob Woolmer, who passed away during the World Cup in the West Indies. I learned a lot from him. After I scored the century, I thought about him. I would like to dedicate my match winning knock in his memory.

 CRICKET BRIEFS 
						
	Imran gives TV contract a miss					
	 Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan has not been able to honour a contract with a leading sports television channel for the ongoing India-Pakistan one-day series as he is forced to go underground after the imposition of emergency in the country last Saturday. Sources close to him confirmed Imran had gone into hiding after law enforcement agencies tried to place him under house arrest soon after President General Pervez Musharraf declared a state of emergency.						
	 No visa for 				 Pak minister						
	 Islamabad: A Pakistan minister was left ldquo;disappointed rdquo; on Tuesday after he was denied visa to watch the one-day International match between India and Pakistan in Mohali. Railways minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed intended to watch Thursday rsquo;s second ODI, but was informed by the Indian high commission in Islamabad that he could not be issued the required visa.						
	 Murali: Won rsquo;t copy India						
	 Melbourne: Sri Lanka would not emulate India rsquo;s ultra-aggressive tactics against Australia during their upcoming two-Test series Down Under, spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan has said. ldquo;(We want) to play decent cricket and not (approach it) like the Indians, rdquo; Muralidharan said at Queensland cricket rsquo;s annual Test match luncheon, a daily reported Tuesday.						
	 Qualifiers postponed						
	 Calcutta: The ICC on Tuesday announced the postponement of the upcoming women rsquo;s World Cup qualifiers scheduled to be staged in Lahore November 19-25, says A Staff Reporter. The decision was arrived at following independent security reports and extensive discussions by ICC management and the ICC Women rsquo;s Committee.						
	 Nielsen plan						
	 Melbourne: Former Australia coach John Buchanan derived inspiration from Chinese warlord Sun Tzu rsquo;s ldquo;The Art of War rdquo; but his predecessor Tim Nielsen has gone one step further and enlisted a former military officer to motivate his wards ahead of the Test series against Sri Lanka. According to a report in a Sydney daily, Nielsen has roped in Ray McLean who had a distinguished five-year stint with the Royal Australian Air Force where he served as a leadership officer.						
	 SA awards				 
	 Durban: Charl Langeveldt, Justin Kemp and Paul Harris are among the five players chosen for the South African cricketers of the year awards. The awards are given out by the country rsquo;s cricket yearbook magazine. The other two cricketers chosen are Morne van Wyk and Goolam Bodi.

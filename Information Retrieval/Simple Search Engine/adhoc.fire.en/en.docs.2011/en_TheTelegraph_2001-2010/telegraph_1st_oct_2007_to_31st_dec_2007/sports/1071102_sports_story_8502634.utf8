 Dravid shouldve been in side, says Kumble
 Anil Kumble Mumbai: Ace leg-spinner Anil Kumble says the forthcoming three-Test series against Pakistan is going to be tough in spite of the absence of the visitors former captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who has recently called it quits. Inzamam is a great player. Hes a quality player. Its definitely a bonus for us to not bowl at someone like Inzy. But Pakistan have a formidable batting line up with fantastic batsmen in Mohammed Yousuf, Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik, said Kumble, who has grabbed 63 wickets in 12 Tests against Pakistan, including 39 in six Tests at home. Kumble said though he would have preferred former captain Rahul Dravid to be in the international side, his presence in the Ranji team would be beneficial for the youngsters in the Karnataka side. I would have preferred him to be in the international side. Good to have his services for Ranji Trophy. For the kind of experience he has, the younger lot in the team will learn by sharing the same dressing room with Rahul, he said. Dravid has been omitted from the Indian one-day squad for the first two ties against Pakistan on November 5 and 8 at Guwahati and Mohali leading to a raging debate in the country. Kumble also said that getting a good start was important to set the momentum. Its going to be an important and tough series. The last time they came here (2004-05) they drew. Its important for us to start well in the first Test in Delhi, said Indias leading wicket-taker in Tests at the Wankhede Stadium here on Thursday. The 37-year-old Bangalore stalwart, leading his state team Karnataka for their season-opening Ranji Trophy clash against defending champions Mumbai from November 3, hoped that the Kotla will continue to be a happy hunting ground for him. Delhi has been a good ground for me and hopefully I will be able to do what I have done at the Kotla. I hope it will be a good start for me and the squad, said Kumble, who has picked 10/74 against Pakistan in the 1998-99 rubber at the Kotla.  (PTI)

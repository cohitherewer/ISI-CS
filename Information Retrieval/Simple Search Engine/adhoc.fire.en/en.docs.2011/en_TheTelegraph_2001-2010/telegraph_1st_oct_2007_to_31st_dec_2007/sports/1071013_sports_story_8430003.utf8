 NZ players chief slams IPL deals
A STAFF REPORTER Daniel Vettori Calcutta: The New Zealand Cricket Players Association chief Heath Mills has described the Indian Premier League (IPL) contracts signed by Daniel Vettori and Scott Styris as the worst contracts Ive seen in professional sport. The New Zealand pair were announced by the IPL as new signings this week but Mills revealed Thursday that only Styris had signed the contract and it was against his recommendation. Mills claimed the pair were subjected to considerable pressure by the IPL and New Zealand Cricket to sign otherwise the lucrative three-year offers would have been withdrawn. We recommended they didnt sign the contract put in front of them and Im not sure whether Daniel has signed, Mills stated in a press release. The contracts put in front of the players are the worst contract Ive seen in professional sport. It is 112 pages long, it is an MoU , and players around the world have been signing it and they have no idea what they are signing away. It does not stipulate the rights they are giving away to Indian cricket. Im concerned our guys signing it will put them in breach of their NZC contracts.

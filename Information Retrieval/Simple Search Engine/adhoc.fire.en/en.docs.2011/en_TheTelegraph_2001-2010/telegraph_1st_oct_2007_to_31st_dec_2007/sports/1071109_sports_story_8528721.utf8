 Henry, Messi score in Barcelona win
 Thierry Henry after scoring on Wednesday Barcelona: Goals from Thierry Henry and Lionel Messi earned Barcelona a 2-0 win over outclassed Rangers in their Champions League group E match at the Nou Camp on Wednesday. Former Arsenal striker Henry put Barcelona ahead in the sixth minute when he bundled the ball in at the far post with a little help from his arm. Messi also pounced just before the break after Ronaldinho had sliced through the Scottish teams defence. The win left the Catalans firmly in control of the group with 10 points from four games. Rangers remain second with seven points, one ahead of Olympique Lyon, despite suffering their first defeat. Walter Smiths men are assured of at least a place in the Uefa Cup. This was a game we could have won 5-0 or 6-0, Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard told a news conference. Arsenal qualified for the Champions League knockout stages while Inter Milan took a big step towards the last 16 after fighting back from 0-2 down to beat CSKA Moscow 4-2 on Wednesday. A 0-0 draw at Slavia Prague took Arsenal through from group H and Sevilla look set to join them after two goals by Brazilian midfielder Renato clinched a 2-0 win at bottom club Steaua Bucharest. Arsene Wengers Arsenal side have 10 points, followed by Sevilla with nine and Slavia on four while Steaua have only a slim chance of taking a consolation Uefa Cup berth for third-placed teams after losing their opening four games. Inter Milan roared back after Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Esteban Cambiasso each scored twice to wipe out CSKA goals from Brazilian strikers Jo and Vagner Love. Love set up Jo to give CSKA the lead with a searing shot and then doubled their advantage with a fine solo effort. Ibrahimovic pulled one back after 33 minutes before Cambiasso swept in the equaliser. The pair were on target again in the second half to put Inter in the driving seat in group G with nine points, one more than Fenerbahce after they beat PSV Eindhoven 2-0. A Dirk Marcellis own goal and a clinical finish by Semih Senturk kept the Turkish champions well placed to join Inter and left PSV, who have four points, an uphill task of reaching the last 16 for the fourth time in a row. Meanwhile, Olympique Lyon kept alive their hopes of reaching the knockout phase by eliminating VfB Stuttgart with a 4-2 home victory on Wednesday. Lyon, who had lost their two opening games, are third in group E with six points from four games, one point behind second-placed Rangers. We knew that it would be difficult against such a side, who attack a lot, said Lyon coach Alain Perrin. When we were at 3-2, we did not really know what to do, we did not know whether we had to keep pushing or sit back.  (REUTERS)

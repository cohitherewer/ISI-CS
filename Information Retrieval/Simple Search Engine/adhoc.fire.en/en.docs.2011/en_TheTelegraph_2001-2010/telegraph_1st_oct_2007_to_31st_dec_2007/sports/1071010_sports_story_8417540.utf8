 Jeev wants to keep emotions in check
 Jeev Milkha Singh shows off the Hero Honda Indian Open trophy at a press conference in New Delhi on Tuesday. The meet begins on Thursday. (PTI) New Delhi: Indias top golfer Jeev Milkha Singh says his key to success in the Indian Open golf would be to keep emotions at bay and play consistently throughout the event. I will have to keep the aggression away and think positively on the course. I will have to manage myself well on all four days of the event to succeed, said Jeev, who is yet to win an Indian Open. The 77-ranked Indian, who had an extraordinary last year with four Tour titles and the top spot in the UBS Order of Merit, said he was looking forward to wrap up the year on a good note by reclaiming a spot in the top 50. Hopefully, I will move back into the top 50, said Jeev. He had climbed into the elite group last year after winning an Asian Tour title at the Volvo Open in China, a joint Asian and European Tour title at the Volvo Masters, also in China, besides back-to-back wins on the Japan Tour last year. By entering the top 50 club, he had become eligible to play in the US PGA Tour but has gradually slid down in the last 10 months. Jeev explained he was being rated as average this season because he was result-oriented. I was trying hard in the tournaments so far because am result-oriented and that was putting a lot of pressure on me. I am being rated average this season in comparison to my last years achievements, he said. But there are still nine weeks left of this season. I am looking forward to wrapping up on a good note after being rated average this year, he added. I like playing golf. A lot of people think I need to slow down but I like playing. If I slow down, I will go up in rankings. (Pti)

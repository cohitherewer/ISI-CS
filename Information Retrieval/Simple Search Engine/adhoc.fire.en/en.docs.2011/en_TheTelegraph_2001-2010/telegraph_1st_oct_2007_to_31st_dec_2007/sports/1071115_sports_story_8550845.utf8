 Connection may strike 
 STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs crack sprinter Regal Connection may be hard to beat in the 1,200m RWITC Cup on Thursday. 				 										The Mr Mellon colt has had a fruitful summer season down south and has also been well-rested since his return last month. 				 										Regal Connection, however, may have to challenge the might of Star Team who narrowly lost the Mysore Derby a fortnight ago. What weighs heavily against Star Team is his quick run  from the Derby trip to a sprint  and less than a week to acclimatise to the city conditions. Jockey C. Alford, who partners the Connection, is also expected to guide home another classy Vijay-trainee Azuerus in the 1,400m Sentouki Cup for horses in Class II and Class III.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

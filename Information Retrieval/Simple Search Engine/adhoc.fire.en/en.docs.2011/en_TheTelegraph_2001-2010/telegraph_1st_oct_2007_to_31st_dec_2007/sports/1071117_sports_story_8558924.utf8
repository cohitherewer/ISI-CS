 IHF keen to revive game in Bengal
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) is keen to revive the game in Bengal, looking for sponsors to install astroturf in the state. According to a well-placed source in the IHF, efforts are being made at the highest level to raise funds so that the Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) could get an astroturf at the earliest. The BHA is believed to have earmarked a land on the National Highway Six for this purpose. It is around 11 kilometres away from the second Hooghly bridge. But even if the state body manages to acquire the land, it does not have enough resources to build a stadium there, the source told The Telegraph on Friday. We are looking for sponsors to make this possible, he added. We formed a team called Bengal Tigers in the first edition of the PHL, which didnt do well and never featured in the following editions. We are trying to revive it, he said. Calcutta-based Leisure Sports Management is the marketing agents of the IHF. Addressing a media conference, IHF president K.P.S. Gill later said the fourth edition of the PHL would be played in Chandigarh from December 20. The winners will receive Rs 40 lakh as prize money. PHL TEAMS amp; CAPTAINS Orissa Steelers (Dilip Tirkey), Sher-e Jalandhar (Kanwalpreet Singh), Chandigarh Dynamos (Rajpal Singh), Chennai Veerans (Adam Sinclair), Maratha Warriors (Viren Rasquinha), Bangalore Hi-Fliers (Tushar Khandekar), Hyderabad Sultans (Sardara Singh).

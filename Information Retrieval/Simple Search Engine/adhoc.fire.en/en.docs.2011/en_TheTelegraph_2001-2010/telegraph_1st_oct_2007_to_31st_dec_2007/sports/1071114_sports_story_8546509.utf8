 Arsenal move atop table
London: Classy Arsenal cruised to a 3-1 win at Reading on Monday to extend their club record to 27 unbeaten matches and replace Manchester United on top of the Premier League. Goals from Frenchman Mathieu Flamini after 44 minutes, Ivorian Emmanuel Adebayor after 52 and Belarussian Aleksandr Hleb 12 minutes from time lifted Arsenal to 30 points from 12 matches. United have 30 points from 13 games. Both teams have goal differences of plus 17 but Arsenal are on top, having netted 27 to Uniteds 23. Flamini, who had not scored for Arsenal since December, put his team ahead with a close-range deflected shot after a good passing move. Adebayor made it 2-0 with a curling shot inside keeper Marcus Hahnemanns far post, chalking up Arsenals 1,000th Premier League goal. Hleb added the third after twisting past the keeper and lashing home when it appeared he might lose control of the ball. I felt we were in control, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. Its good to win when you play the last match (of the weekend). We showed we had the nerve to deal with that and we are heading the league, in charge and just want to stay in control. Arsenal, who were last beaten in any competition on April 7, could easily have won by a bigger margin on a chilly night at the Madejski Stadium. (REUTERS)

 Eden snippets 
Koertzen to replace Bowden Rudi Koertzen will replace Billy Bowden as umpire for the second Test between India and Pakistan at the Eden from Friday. We have received a message from the ICC that Koertzen will umpire the match in place of Bowden, a CAB official said. It was learnt that Bowden had pulled out because of personal reasons. Billy Doctrove will be the other umpire.Late invitation The all-important steering committee meeting for the Test here was held on Tuesday evening without city police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti being present. Sounds unbelievable, given that one has been hearing of threats to disrupt the match. Chakrabarti couldnt make it as the CAB invitation reached him just a few hours before the meeting. Obviously, somebody in the CAB thought that its president, Prasun Mukherjee, continues to be the Commissioner of Police.X-ray machine on loan  The city police had to go out of their way to beef up security at the five star hotel which is hosting the teams. What is rather surprising is that the hotel has no CCTV facility of its own and that has had to be installed by Lal Bazar. Also, in the absence of an X-ray machine the local police have had to borrow one from one of the central security agencies. This has been done to screen every piece of baggage  including small items  which comes into the hotel. Sight-screen The height of the sight-screen at the pavilion end will have to be increased by at least three feet. This was pointed out by Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle during an inspection on Wednesday.The CAB got down to set things right by the evening. It will mean losing the front three rows of the lower tier of the Club House.  BY OUR STAFF REPORTERS

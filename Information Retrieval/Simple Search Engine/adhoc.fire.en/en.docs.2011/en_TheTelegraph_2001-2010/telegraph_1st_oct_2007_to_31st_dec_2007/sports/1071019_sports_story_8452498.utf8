 The function saw Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan clinch the International Cricketer Award while Mahela Jayawardene walked away with the International Batsman Award. Australia, expectedly, were chosen the International Cricket Team for 2006-2007, the evaluation period for the awards.
 The Indian team, winners of the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa, were also felicitated, according to information received here. 
 Malik, Younis join IPL

Modi also rubbished reports from the New Zealand Players Council (NZPC) stating IPL was offering the worst contracts ever. 
PCB to take a cue from IPL
Karachi: A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official will visit India to study the model of BCCI rsquo;s Indian Premier League (IPL), set to be launched next year. PCB director, marketing and communications, Ehsan Hameed Malik will attend a couple of presentations to be made by the IPL organisers in a bid to help the PCB launch its own league. 
Jadeja bats for Dravid
Chandigarh: Former cricketer Ajay Jadeja Thursday said dropping Rahul Dravid from the final one-dayer against Australia was ldquo;unjustified rdquo; as it would bring the batsman under pressure in the upcoming series against Pakistan.
 ldquo;It is not justified. You drop him for the last match, which in any way was inconsequential, makes no sense, rdquo; Jadeja said.

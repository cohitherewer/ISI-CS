 Domenech benefits from rugby coup
Paris: Frances dramatic victory over New Zealand in the quarter finals of the Rugby World Cup prompts scenes of jubilation as fans pour onto the streets, waving flags and honking car horns. The happiest person of all might just be France soccer coach Raymond Domenech. The rugby teams upset victory over the mighty All Blacks has dominated the French sports and news pages as well as television news. That means the media is leaving Domenech alone. Amid the rugby euphoria, people seem to have forgotten the soccer teams stunning 0-1 loss at home to Scotland less than a month ago in a European Championship qualifying match. The defeat dropped France from first to third in their qualifying group. Only two teams per group advance to the tournament next year in Austria and Switzerland. Domenechs team has to pick up maximum points from its next two games  against the Faeroe Islands on Saturday and Lithuania the following Wednesday  to edge closer to Scotland and Italy and stay ahead of Ukraine, places fourth. A glance at the sports pages in Paris on Monday and those games barely get a mention. When Domenech announced his line-up for the two games last week, he didnt want to linger. Ok, we are going to do this very fast, he said. I give you the names and everybody goes home. There will be no questions. Youre all focused on rugby for the moment. While the rugby team plays against defending champions England before 80,000 fans at the Stade de France on Saturday, Les Bleus will play in the Faeroes capital of Torshavn before a few thousand of their own followers. After the loss to the Scots, Domenech decided to drop striker David Trezeguet for the two upcoming games, especially with Thierry Henry returning from suspension. Trezeguet has scored seven goals for his Italian club, Juventus, this season and was recalled by Domenech for the Euro 2008 qualifying games against Italy and Scotland in which Les Bleus failed to score each time. Trezeguets absence is related to the competition, Domenech said. We have six or seven centre forwards. There were choices to make. If France struggle to score against the Faeroes, one of European soccers weakest nations, Domenech will take the heat. When his team takes on Lithuania in Nantes on October 17, the fate of the rugby team will be known. Either France will be playing in the rugby final on October 20 or the host nation will be forced to watch the English play there instead. If the French are out of the Rugby World Cup, Domenech had better watch out. The soccer team will be back in the spotlight and he will have nowhere to hide.  (AP)

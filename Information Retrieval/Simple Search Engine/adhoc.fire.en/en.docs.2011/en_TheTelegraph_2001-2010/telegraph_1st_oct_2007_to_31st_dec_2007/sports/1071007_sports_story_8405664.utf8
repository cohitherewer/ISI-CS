 Wenger flays Blatter plan
 CLUB UPDATE  London: Arsene Wenger claims that Sepp Blatters plan to impose a quota of English players in Premier League teams will damage what he describes as the best league in the world. Arsenal, who have only two Englishmen in their first-team squad, would suffer more than most. Theo Walcott and Justin Hoyte have made only seven appearances during Arsenals nine-game winning run in all competitions. Wenger, speaking ahead of Sundays game against Sunderland, insists that it is English football that would suffer most from Blatters proposals. I share some opinions with Blatter, but this one I dont share, said Wenger. I feel I am responsible for quality and to develop players. But I cannot say to a player, You are good enough but you cannot play because you dont come from the right place. Chelsea hope  London: Chelsea are hoping midfielder Frank Lampard will return after a one-month injury absence for Sundays Premier League game at Bolton Wanderers. Frank trained very hard in the last two weeks and today he made the training session, manager Avram Grant told the clubs website on Friday. We will see after training but he looks good. Lampard, who was named in Englands squad for this months Euro 2008 qualifiers against Estonia and Russia earlier on Friday, has been sidelined since tearing a muscle in his left thigh during a training session in late August. Ten Cate to stay  Amsterdam: Henk Ten Cate said on Friday he was staying as coach at Ajax Amsterdam despite reports that he had agreed to join Chelsea as assistant to Avram Grant. I know that Chelsea are interested in me, Ten Cate told a news conference, according to the Ajax website. But not every story that does the rounds is true. I am coach at Ajax and my position is not up for discussion as far as I know. British newspapers on Friday quoted Ten Cates agent Sigi Lens as saying the coach had agreed to go to Chelsea. But Dutch news agency ANP quoted Ten Cate as saying he wanted to serve out his contract until the end of the season. Dida set to play  Milan: AC Milan goalkeeper Dida looks set to play in Sundays clash at Lazio following his dramatic collapse after being slapped by a pitch-invading fan during their 1-2 Champions League defeat at Celtic on Wednesday. The media has accused the Brazilian of play-acting and he had no signs of injury when he arrived back in Italy despite being carried off on a stretcher following the incident. He is still our first choice, Milan director general Ariedo Braida told reporters when asked if Dida may be left out to avoid embarrassment. Spanish rule change  Madrid: Africans playing in the Primera Liga will no longer occupy berths allocated for non-European Union players after a change in regulations approved by the Spanish football federation. The RFEF gave the green light to the change after consulting with Fifa and Uefa following inquiries by Real Madrid and Getafe as to whether their African players could be treated as European Union workers in accordance with an agreement signed in 2000. The Cotonu accord, signed in Benin by the EU and the 77 members of the Association of African, Caribbean and Pacific states in 2000 and ratified by the Spanish parliament in April last year, agreed to treat workers from those nations as EU citizens.

 Rennedy likely to replace Ajayan
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Bhaichung Bhutia Chandigarh: Eager to cash in on the euphoria of their now famous triumph in the Nehru Cup, Bob Houghton and his men would take on the might of Lebanon in the away leg of the 2010 World Cup first round qualifier in Beirut on Monday. Unlike in the past, the Indians have some knowledge of the opponents as the boys on Sunday were shown the footage of the Lebanon versus Syria match in a regional tournament. India have beaten Syria in the Nehru Cup final only recently. In the current Fifa rankings, Lebanon stand 144, followed by India at 145. According to reports reaching here, Indian coach Bob Houghton told Bhaichung Bhutia and his boys that there are enough reasons to feel optimistic when the match kicks off at the Saida Municipal Stadium at 9pm local time (11.30pm IST). A draw at Beirut would be convenient for the visitors, who have a home match in hand in Chennai on October 28. Houghton, however, does not want to go into the match with all these calculations.  He has asked us to play according to a system and not to curb our attacking game unnecessarily, said a player. The British coach is likely to keep faith with the team that won him the Nehru Cup against Syria. The only change could be Rennedy Singh, who is likely to come in for K. Ajayan on the extreme left of the midfield.

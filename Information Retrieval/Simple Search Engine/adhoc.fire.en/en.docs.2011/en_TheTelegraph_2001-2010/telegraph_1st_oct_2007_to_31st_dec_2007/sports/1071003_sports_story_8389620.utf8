 Hair blames it on Asian bloc
CHARLES RANDALL Darrell Hair London: Darrell Hairs international umpiring career was destroyed by the Asian bloc countries with possible complicity within the ICC, it was alleged at an employment tribunal. Hair is seeking compensation for alleged racial discrimination and harassment in the fall-out from the forfeited Test between England and Pakistan at the Oval in August last year. The ICC robustly denied his claims in London. Robert Griffiths, acting for Hair, mentioned a mysterious gap in the tape recording of a crucial meeting in Mumbai, inappropriate behaviour by delegates at the ICC board meeting that followed and the absence of any disciplinary action against Hair until the stakes were raised by serious allegations of bias. Griffiths told the tribunal that Malcolm Speed, the chief executive of the ICC, wanted Hair to continue to stand in Tests and ODIs, but Pakistan and India were opposed. So he remained on its Elite panel, but he has suffered both personally and financially, Griffiths said. The ICC bowed to the racially discriminatory pressure that was brought to bear on it by the Asian bloc and ICC board member countries. That has traumatised the world of cricket. The Asian bloc is dominant in cricket and sometimes it uses that dominance inappropriately. A fundamental issue is whether this was done to save Pakistans reputation and/or to teach a lesson to a white Australian and any other umpires who dare take similar action. Hair explained why he accused Pakistan of ball-tampering, claiming he felt the state of the ball had been accelerated by human intervention. Another plank of Hairs argument was the role of Billy Doctrove, his fellow-umpire at the Oval that day. The decision was taken jointly, but Doctrove was not harassed or criticised for his part and continued umpiring at the highest level.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

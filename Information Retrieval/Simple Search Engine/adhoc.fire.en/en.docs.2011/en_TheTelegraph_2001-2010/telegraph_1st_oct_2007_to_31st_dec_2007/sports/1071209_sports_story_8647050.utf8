 Bengal set to play four seamers

A STAFF REPORTER
 Shib Shankar Paul all set for a comeback 
Calcutta: Bengal are all set to field four medium-pacers  Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul, Ashok Dinda and Sourav Sarkar  on a green-top wicket, when they take on Orissa in their Ranji Trophy Super League match at the Kanchenjungha Stadium in Siliguri on Sunday. 
A fit Paul is almost certain to be back in the XI after he sat out against Punjab in their last match. Paul is fit to play and is expected to replace Sourashish Lahiri, a source said Saturday. 
Whether to keep the grass on the wicket, will be decided on Sunday morning. 
One factor that worries the Bengal think tank is the Debasis Mohanty factor. Mohanty and Pritamjit Das are the two quickies in the Orissa ranks and the former has the habit of running through the opposition batting line-up under favourable conditions. 
Bengal are almost certain to field if they win the toss however Orissa will decide on Sunday morning. Well see the wicket in the morning and then we will take a decision, Orissa captain and former India opener Shiv Sundar Das said.

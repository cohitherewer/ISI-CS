 Ritwik, Saurav bow out
New Delhi: Indian campaign at the 22nd Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Open squash tournament came to an early end after Ritwik Bhattacharya and Saurav Ghosal bowed out in the first round of the $ 120,000 Super Series event. Ghosal and Ritwik, who did well to qualify for the main draw, could not get past their higher ranked opponents in the prestigious tournament. While Ghosal lost 4-11, 3-11, 4-11 to reigning world champion and third seed David Palmer of Australia, Ritwik went down fighting 6-11, 11-6, 11-9, 8-11, 5-11 to world No. 18 and 14th seed Adrian Grant of England in close to an hour-long contest. Ritwiks match was a thrilling affair as he was in striking distance of scoring the most memorable win of his career but the Indian lost the plot in the fourth game where he and Grant were tied 8-8 before the Englishman came out trumps. Grant dominated the decider and he dug from his experience to run out a 11-5 winner to advance to the second round. (PTI)

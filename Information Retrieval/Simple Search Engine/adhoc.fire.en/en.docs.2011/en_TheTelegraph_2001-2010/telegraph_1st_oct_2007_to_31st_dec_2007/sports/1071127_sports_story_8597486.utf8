 Ritwik tops in Malaysia
 Ritwik New Delhi: Top seed Ritwik Bhattacharya survived a few tense moments before beating fourth seed Pakistans Bilal Zaman in a five-game thriller to clinch the NSC Super Satellite Squash Championship in Kuala Lumpur on Monday. Ritwik got the better of Zaman 11-6, 9-11, 9-11, 11-9, 11-9 in 45 minutes to win the $7,000 tournament. It is a really special day for me. He was playing really well and it was a tough match but I am happy to have come through, Ritwik said from Kuala Lumpur. The former national champion, who endured an 85-minute five-game semi-final on Sunday, said he could have won more comfortably but for some umpiring errors. I was 10-9 up in the third game but a winner was not given. So got a bit unlucky there. Then the fourth and fifth games turned out to be really close. We were tied 9-9 in both the games but I pulled it off from thereon, he recalled the winning moments. The 29-year-old, whose career was in doldrums after a knee injury forced him out for five months earlier this year, said he was back to full fitness and was prepared to endure the longest of matches. Its becoming a trend for me now to play five-gamers but the good thing is that I am winning and I feel nice about my fitness level, he said. My game has improved as well because I dont take winning and losing all that seriously any more. I just go out there and enjoy myself. Earlier it was exactly the opposite. I put too much pressure on myself... Kept watching the videos of the matches I lost and that affected me negatively, he recalled. My coach and my trainer have just been fantastic. They have made me a much stronger person. And I am not just talking about my mental toughness. I have worked out really hard under them to get into shape after the injury, he said. (PTI)

 Star Team stands tall

 STAR RACER
 Calcutta: Regal Connection, Star Team and Steal The Glory, the three of the four runners in the fray for Saturdays main event, the 1,600m Calcutta 2,000 Guineas, are champions in their own right. However, Daniel David-trained Star Team is first among the equals.
				 										Star Teams recent defeat at the hands of Regal Connection is best ignored. On that occasion, the Alnasr Alwasheek-Pleasures son was not only conceding 5kg to the sprint-specialist, he was also pushed into a short-distance race within five days of his arrival from Mysore. More importantly, 10 days earlier, Star Team had had a hard race in the Mysore Derby, which he lost by a probervial whisker. Colm Donoghue partners the likely course-favourite.
				 										The challenge, if any, to the favourite may come from his stablemate, Steal The Glory who already has two monsoon Classics  including the Derby  under his belt.

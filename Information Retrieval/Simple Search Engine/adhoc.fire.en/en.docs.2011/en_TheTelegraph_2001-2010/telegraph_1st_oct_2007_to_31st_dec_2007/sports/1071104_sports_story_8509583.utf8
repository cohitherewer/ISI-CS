 Were well prepared: RP
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Rudra Pratap Singh has been a revelation in the past few months. Be it on the tour of England or in the World Twenty20 triumph, the left-arm pacer has consistently proved his mettle. His performance graph has suddenly seen a rise and the Uttar Pradesh youngster attributes it to his finding a regular place in the side. Besides an increase in pace, RP has also made good use of the seam in friendly conditions overseas. RP made his mark on Indias tour of Pakistan last year when he was placed second among Indian bowlers in both Tests and ODIs  nine wickets in two Tests and eight wickets in three ODIs. He is looking forward to another inspired performance against the arch-rivals this time too. Weve been playing a lot of cricket over the last four months. I will concentrate on bowling in the right areas and focus on strong points I will always try to improve, RP said on the conclusion of the conditioning camp here. I have done well against them in the World Twenty20 Back in Pakistan, too, I did well. Whatever I try against them works This time, too, we are well prepared, he added. What has been the secret of his recent success? I have been playing regularly and the improvement is showing When you play regularly, you pick up a few things along the way. I am happy to have been doing my bit for my team. The Indians practised for nearly three hours on Saturday with special emphasis on pick ups and throws. Robin Singh worked overtime with the players as they practised the basics. Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir also joined the team at nets. Stress was also laid on improving the running between wickets. Strangely, the Indians had no bowling machine to help them get used to the express pace of Shoaib Akhtar and Umar Gul. The way some of the batsmen struggled against the moving and the short ball didnt augur well for Mondays opener in Guwahati. In the evening, the bowlers were given a pep talk by Venkatesh Prasad and Lalchand Rajput. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was also present at the meeting.

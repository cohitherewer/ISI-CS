 I give my best when in difficulty
JAYDEEP BASUNew Delhi: For Jyoti Randhawa, a triumphant finish in the Indian Open on Sunday was something more than just his seventh title in the Asian Tour events. The local boy, who turned emotional immediately after winning the championship for the third time, said he finally realised what maturity means to a golfer. All I can say that I played matured golf, he said. Going into the final day, I knew I would be under tremendous pressure. I tried to take pressure off me. I think I did a great job. I know if you are focused and matured, you will succeed. I did exactly the same and earned a present for that. A highly talented player, Randhawas career has seen many ups and downs. Asias No.1 in 2002, he ended a two-year winless run by lifting his second Indian Open title in 2006. It was one of the most thrilling finishes at the Delhi Golf Club last year as Randhawa missed a short putt in the first play-off on Sunday evening but wrapped it up the next morning with a birdie against S.S.P. Chowrasia. Randhawa admitted that Sundays win would always have a special place in his career. I was emotional and elated. Delhi Golf Club has a unique place in my mind. Winning there, that too the hattrick of national titles, is extra special. Other than winning the Indian Open thrice, Randhawa won the 2000 Singapore Open, 2004 Volvo Masters of Asia in Malaysia and 2003 Santory Open in Japan Golf Tour. Currently witnessing a purple patch in his career, the 35-year-old golfer finished within the top 10 at the OSIM Singapore Masters and Brunei Open and claimed third spot at the Pulai Springs Malaysian Masters. A week later after claiming his maiden Indian Open in 2000, Randhawa won the Bilt Open on the domestic circuit. He also finished within top 10 at the HSBC Champions in Shanghai where he played with Tiger Woods in the third round and was tied third at the UBS Hong Kong Open. The Indian also comfortably retained his European Tour card after a solid rookie season in 2006 where he finished 68th on the Order of Merit with three top-10 finishes. In 2005, Randhawa endured a difficult season owing to injuries during mid-year which ruled him out for more than two months but returned to the Tour stronger than ever with a brave comeback. I give my best when I am in difficulty, Randhawa said on Sunday. Somehow, I manage to take out my best during that period. The star golfer is happy to have emulated the feat of Australian Peter Thompson of winning the title on three occasions but he was not ready much importance to creating records. Highlighting records is medias job. They like to do it and do it in a great manner. As a player, I cannot focus on that. I cant think about it when I am plying. I have to be focused on the game.

 ICL sends notice to Yousuf
New Delhi: The Indian Cricket League (ICL) on Friday sent a legal notice to Pakistans prolific batsman Mohammed Yousuf for breach of contract following his decision to pull out of its high-profile tournament. Yousuf had initially signed the contract to play in the ICLs proposed Twenty20 tournament in November but changed his mind and aligned with the Indian Premier League (IPL), the cash-rich venture launched by the BCCI. The Pakistani middle-order batsman changed his decision after a recent meeting with PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf who had also assured Yousuf that the PCB would take care of the legal hassles that may arise for not honouring the ICL commitment. Yousufs decision not to align with the ICL, which has not been recognised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) or its affiliated members, also made him eligible to play for Pakistan again. We tried our best to reach out to Yousuf and seek certain clarifications about the statements he had made at a press conference. He did not respond to three reminders, forcing us to send a legal notice for breach of contract, executive vice-president of Essel Group Ashish Kaul said. (PTI)

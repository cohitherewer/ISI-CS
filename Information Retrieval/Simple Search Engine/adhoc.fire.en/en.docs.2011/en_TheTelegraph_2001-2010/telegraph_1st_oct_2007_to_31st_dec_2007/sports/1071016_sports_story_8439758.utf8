 Mexico meet went like a dream: Anand
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: World chess champion Viswanathan Anand, who arrived in the capital in the early hours of Monday, said his triumph in Mexico City was a victory for all Indians. Anand arrived to a tumultuous welcome at the Delhi airport. I am happy that so many people have come to greet me, he said. It makes me feel special. The scene at the airport turned quite chaotic but the champion displayed remarkable composure as he made his way through the crowd to the car. I dont think there was too much chaos. We can always handle this much, he said. The Madrid-based world champion said he was proud to win the title for the second time. Chess is a game mostly dominated by Europeans. My becoming the world champion, that too for the second time, will certainly give a lot of impetus to the game in India. Anand felt he had to remain alert to keep up the momentum. I will be looking to maintain my Elo ratings, he said while emphasising that he was not looking too far ahead. Anands wife Aruna said the Indian had received many accolades in Mexico City after clinching the crown. The audience there started making the Mexican wave after Anand drew the last round against Peter Leko to win the title. It was very gratifying. Anand had remained undefeated to tally nine points for victory. The tournament went like a dream, he said. Anand, 37, had won his first world championship in 2000, but the chess world had already been split by Garri Kasparov who hadwalked out of the official body, Fide, in 1993 and formed a rebel association. The two rival bodies unified last year. It was fantastic to win the tournament while remaining undefeated, continued Anand. The win helped me keep my top position in the world rankings and since last year we have unified titles, so I am the undisputed world champion now. Later on Monday, Anand met President Pratibha Patil. Anand leaves for Chennai on Wednesday where he will be felicitated by the All India Chess Federation (AICF).

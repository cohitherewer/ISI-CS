 Kapur tied 18th
Vilamoura: Shiv Kapur seems to have got his elusive form back as the Delhi golfer fired a bogey-free opening round of five-under 67 to be tied 18th in the Portugal Masters at the Oceanico Victoria Golf Club. Compatriot Jeev Milkha Singh turned in a card of two-under 70 to join the huddle at 61st slot. Twenty two-year-old German rookie Martin Kaymer set a scorching pace with a scintillating round of 11-under 61 to set a new course record, besides equalling the lowest round of the European Tour season. He has a three-shot lead over Argentine Daniel Vancsik and Swede Martin Erlandsson. Kapur had done well at the Open De Madrid, where he finished a commendable tied 18th, and the youngster started from where he had left last week. A sedate front nine saw him pick up a shot on the sixth hole but better was to follow once he took the turn. On his way back, Kapur parried the first two and then slotted four birdies over the next six holes  on 12th, 14th, 15th and 17th.  (PTI)

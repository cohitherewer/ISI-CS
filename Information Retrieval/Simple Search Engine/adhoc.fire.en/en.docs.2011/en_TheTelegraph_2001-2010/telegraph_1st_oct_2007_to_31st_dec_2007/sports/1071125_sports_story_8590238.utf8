 Karthikeyan disappoints
Sepang: A brand new engine hardly made any difference to A1 Team Indias fortunes as Narain Karthikeyan qualified 14th for the sprint race and 11th for the feature race of A1 GP Malaysia to be held Sunday. I was hoping to qualify better as I know the track well. I am going to drive my heart out to get great finishes and collect points for my team and my country, Karthikeyan said after the qualifying sessions Saturday. The overheating problems experienced by the team Friday were overcome with the installation of the brand new engine supplied by Zytek. In the qualifying lap for the feature race, Karthikeyan clocked 1:50.700 seconds, which placed him in 11th position  1.697 seconds behind A1 team Switzerlands Neel Jani. (PTI)

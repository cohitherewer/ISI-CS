				 																																																				Dubai: Tiger Woods has confirmed he will play in the Dubai Desert Classic early next year, organisers said on Tuesday. The 2006 Classic champion is still working out his 2008 schedule but has already committed to play in Dubai at the Emirates Golf Club from January 31 to February 3.				 																																																				Woods, who first appeared in the Desert Classic in 2001, finished tied for third in the 2007 edition of the European Tour event, two shots adrift of eventual winner Henrik Stenson of Sweden, despite poor putting.				 																																																				Well, thats one of the worst putting weeks I have had in a long time. Very frustrating, said the world No. 1. I always enjoy visiting Dubai  its an extremely hospitable place. The level of competition is always extremely high, so I know Ill have to play my best golf if Im going to defend my title, he said. 				 																																																				New Delhi: Ace forward Mamta Kharab will lead the Indian team in the four-nation Lal Bahadur Shastri womens hockey tournament to be held here from December 1-5.				 																																																				In the 18-member team announced on Tuesday, the experienced Mamta and Saba Anjum, alongwith youngster Ritu Rani, will hold the key upfront. Suman Bala is the vice-captain of the side.				 																																																				Varna: Bulgarian club Cherno More Varna, under investigation over allegations of match-fixing, have denied any wrongdoing.				 																																																				Its an extremely unpleasant case but we think that the charges are unwarranted, Cherno Mores lawyer Mihail Statev said at a news conference on Tuesday.				 																																																				A Uefa spokesman said on Monday an investigation had been opened after European soccers governing body was alerted to heavy and unusual betting on the first leg of the second-round Intertoto Cup game against Macedonias Makedonija on July 7, which Cherno More won 4-0.				 																																																				He said an initial hearing into the case would take place on Thursday.				 																																																				Vienna: Austrian Formula One team Red Bull would not be interested in a one-year deal with double world champion Fernando Alonso, team owner Dietrich Mateschitz said. From what Im hearing, (Alonso) is only negotiating with the other teams for a one-year deal, Mateschitz told a German weekly. A deal like that would be out of the question for us. Mateschitz said Red Bull would consider offering Alonso a longer contract but did not say if talks had taken place with the Spanish driver. He said the team would want a two-year deal with an option to extend into a third year. We would rather wait another year and show that we are capable of building a car for 2009 that would be worthy of attracting one of the best Grand Prix drivers, he said. Alonso left McLaren on November 2 after a tempestuous year and has since been linked to several constructors, including his old team Renault with whom he won in 2005 and 2006. 				 																																																				Beijing: The International Olympic Committee  and not the Chinese security departments  will have the final say in approving the official accreditation for journalists at next years Beijing Olympics, a top Beijing Olympic official said Tuesday.

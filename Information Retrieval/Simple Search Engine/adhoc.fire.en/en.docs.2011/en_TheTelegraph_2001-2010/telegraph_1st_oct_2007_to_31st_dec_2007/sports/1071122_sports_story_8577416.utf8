 Indias chance to move up
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: India could move up to second place in LG ICC Test Championship table. A 3-0 win over Pakistan would lift them above England; 2-0 success would see Anil Kumbles side rise to third, according to a release on Wednesday. A clean sweep would catapult India, currently fourth, above third-placed South Africa and England. If sixth-placed Pakistan were beaten in all three Tests, they would lose five rating points and slip below New Zealand but conversely, the visitors also have a chance to make progress up the table. A 3-0 series win would not only lift Pakistan to fifth position, but would also drop India to sixth. Australia head the table, extending their advantage over England to 32 rating points after a 2-0 series success over Sri Lanka that was confirmed on Tuesday. The good news for Pakistan is that they are the most represented side in the bowling top 20 with four players in the elite group  Shoaib Akhtar (10th), Danish Kaneria (14th), Mohammed Asif, currently sidelined with an elbow injury (17th), and Umar Gul (20th).

 Aussies go 3-1 up
Vadodara: Seamer Mitchell Johnson claimed his first five-wicket haul in one-day Internationals to lead Australia to a crushing nine-wicket victory over India in the fifth match of the seven-match series on Thursday. The 25-year-old took five for 26 in a display of remarkable swing bowling to bundle the hosts out for 148 in 39.4 overs. Adam Gilchrist, who held six catches behind the stumps, hit a magnificent unbeaten 79 including seven fours and four sixes as Australia reached 149 for one in 25.5 overs to take a 3-1 lead in the seven-match series. Left-armer Johnson took the wickets of Yuvraj Singh (1), Robin Uthappa (5) and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (4) in a deadly opening spell to leave the hosts reeling at 43 for five by the 10th over. Man of the Match Johnson snared Irfan Pathan (26) and Murali Kartik (0) in a fine second spell after fast bowler Brett Lee had dismissed Sachin Tendulkar for 47. Sachin, playing his 400th one-day International, struck nine boundaries in his 73-ball knock and put on 49 for the sixth wicket before Lee had him caught behind with a delightful outswinger. Sachin became the second player after Sri Lankas Sanath Jayasuriya to play 400 one-dayers. A streaky 41-run stand between the last-wicket pair of Zaheer Khan (28) and Rudra Pratap Singh (12 not out) helped take the total near the 150-run mark. The victory has ensured that Australians can no longer lose the series while the Indians have been left with the stiff task of winning the remaining two matches in Nagpur (October 14) and Mumbai (October 17) to level the series.

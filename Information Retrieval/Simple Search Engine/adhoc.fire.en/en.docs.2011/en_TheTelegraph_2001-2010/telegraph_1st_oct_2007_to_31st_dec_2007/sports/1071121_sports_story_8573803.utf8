 Delhi, London ink agreement
New Delhi: Organisers of the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games and 2012 London Olympics on Tuesday agreed to co-operate with each other to ensure that the two mega events are staged successfully. The organising committees signed the principles of mutual assistance, according to which both cities will work together to ensure enhanced delivery of the two events. The successive staging of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in 2010 and the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London in 2012 provides an opportunity for the two host cities to work together to enhance the delivery of these two major events, based around relevant city and event planning, services, operations and issues, the agreement stated. The exact areas of co-operation are still to be discussed but 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi said it would be an ongoing process and the two committees would do whatever was needed to ensure that the two events go full blast. Kalmadi signed the MoU on Delhis behalf with Sebastian Coe, who represented London. (PTI)

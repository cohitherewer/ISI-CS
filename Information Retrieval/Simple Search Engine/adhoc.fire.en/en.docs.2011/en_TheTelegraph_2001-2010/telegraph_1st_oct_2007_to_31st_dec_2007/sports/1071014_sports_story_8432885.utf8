 Flintoff out till New Year
Giles Mole Andrew Flintoff Andrew Flintoff has undergone a fourth operation in almost three years on his left ankle and now faces a long recovery period before he can regain his England place. Flintoff underwent keyhole surgery in Holland Friday and, as expected, the England and Wales Cricket Board have confirmed he will miss the Test tour of Sri Lanka which starts next month. An ECB statement also suggests Flintoff, 29, will not be fit in time for the tour of New Zealand in February and March next year, leaving his future as an international allrounder in doubt. The ECB said: He will now undergo a period of rest and convalescence, followed by a rehabilitation programme. Andrew will not be made available for this winters Test series in Sri Lanka, and at this stage it is considered unlikely that he will participate in the tour of New Zealand. Since having his first operation in early 2005, Flintoff has struggled for an injury-free run in either the Test or one-day side and has missed 11 out of the last 16 Tests, including the whole of last summer and the series against West Indies and India. He has been an even bigger absentee in the one-day format and has been sidelined through injury for 21 of the last 48 one-day Internationals, including Saturdays final match of the series against Sri Lanka at the Premadasa Stadium. It prompted England to send him home for further checks, rather than include him in their plans for the Sri Lanka one-day series, to try to find a final diagnosis for the problem.

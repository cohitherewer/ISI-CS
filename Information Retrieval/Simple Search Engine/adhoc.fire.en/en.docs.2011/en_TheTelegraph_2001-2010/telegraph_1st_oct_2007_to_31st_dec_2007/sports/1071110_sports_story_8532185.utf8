 Short-term appointment draws flak
A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES Calcutta: Opinion is divided over the appointment of Anil Kumble as India captain for the three Tests against Pakistan. For some, its too short a term, while others feel Indias highest Test wickettaker deserves the honour. Kumble, 37, came into contention after Sachin Tendulkar declined a third term as captain. Rahul Dravid quit as captain in September. The following are reactions from former India players to Kumbles appointment as captain (alphabetically): Deep Dasgupta (former India wicketkeeper): Lets not go into what is right and what is wrong Kumble has respect from all members of the team and hes an automatic choice once Sachin said no to the job. But honestly speaking, Sourav Ganguly was my first choice for the job. Aunshuman Gaekwad (former India batsman and coach): A stopgap arrangement is made for a specific reason. But I see no reason in naming Anil for just three Tests They should have named him till the Australia tour at least. This move suggests they are not sure of what they are doing Devang Gandhi (former India batsman): Though its a stopgap arrangement, I am happy that his contribution to Indian cricket has been recognised with this honour. The focus has always been on three seniors  Sachin, Sourav and Rahul  while Kumble has remained the unsung hero. Ajay Jadeja (former India batsman and stand-in ODI captain): How often do you have a successful captain and a successful team? We have had one for the past two-three months. There has been no negative vibes coming from the team and everyone seems to be happy with Dhoni as a leader. Ashok Malhotra (former India batsman and selector): Isnt it a compromise move? Are we planning to move forward or backward? Secondly, why has Kumble been picked as captain for only three Tests? Sourav would have been my choice in this situation. Kiran More (former India wicketkeeper and selector): Dhonis an excellent captain, but he should pplay another year of Test cricket before hes handed the Test reins Given the situation, Anil was the best choice. Navjyot Singh Sidhu (former India batsman): Are they (selectors) not playing with the interest of the country? When you appoint Kumble as captain, it is nothing but a retrograde step.

 Beckhams concern
Vienna: David Beckham is tantalisingly close to becoming only the fifth Englishman in history to earn 100 caps for his country but claims he is more concerned with the prospect of England missing out on the Euro 2008 finals. Beckham played his 98th international game in Fridays 1-0 friendly victory over Austria and is expected to earn another cap against Croatia on Wednesday. But he faces the prospect of being stuck on 99 should England fail to qualify for the European championships because that scenario would almost certainly lead to calls for a fresh approach. The LA Galaxy medio, who is 32, insists that it is not his primary concern. That is not preying on my mind at all. I am not thinking about that. All I am thinking about is the team qualifying for the competition, he said. These games are not about David Beckham reaching 100 caps. It is about the team reaching the European finals and that is the most important thing. Only four England players in history have completed a century of caps. Peter Shilton holds the record with 125 and the only outfield players to achieve the mark are Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton and Billy Wright. If selected, Beckham could join that prestigious group as early as February when England are expected to play in yet unconfirmed friendly against Switzerland  or in March when they are due to face France in Paris. But although the midfielder wishes to continue his international career and has no immediate plans to retire, Englands stuttering Euro 2008 qualifying campaign is in itself a threat to his dream. England face Croatia in their final group E qualifying tie at Wembley without top scorer Michael Owen after he suffered a thigh strain against Austria and already missing injured Wayne Rooney. Unfortunately Michael has come off injured and that is going to be a big loss to us but we know the situation we are in, the position we are in, said beckham after victory in austria. We are waiting for teams to do us favours and, if they do us favours, we have to be ready. We can beat Croatia. If we are given the chance, we have to be ready. We cant make excuses. We have to be ready for Croatia and if other teams slip up, we need to take advantage.  (AFP)

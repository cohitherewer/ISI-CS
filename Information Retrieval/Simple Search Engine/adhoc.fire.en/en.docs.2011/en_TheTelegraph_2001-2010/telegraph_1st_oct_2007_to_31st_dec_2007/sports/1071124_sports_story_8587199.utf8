 Salgaocar eyes upset vs Dempo 
Margao: Salgaocar are keen to regain their past glory with a win over Dempo in the opening match of the inaugural ONGC I-League at Nehru Stadium on Saturday. Salgaocars poor form for the last couple of years saw them lose their place in the 10th National Football League in 2005-06. Now that they are back in the premier division, they are more determined to make an impression in the countrys premier club competition. Our boys have been working hard for the prestigious league and are prepared to take on Dempo with a positive frame of mind, Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira said. The first match is important in any tournament and we are keen to do well against Dempo. Getting a positive result in that game will definitely set the tone for us, Medeira, who was named the best coach in the Durand Cup, added. For Salgaocar, there is no injury worry, but Dempo  last years NFL champions  will be missing their reliable winger Clifford Miranda. He suffered a fracture in the Durand Cup and is yet to recover from the injury. However, with the likes of Mahesh Gawli, Sameer Naik and Climax Lawrence in their line-up along with three foreigners  Ranty Martins, Edeh Chidi and Roberto Mendes Silva all in peak form, Dempo look formidable. Exuding confidence ahead of the opener, Dempo coach Armando Colaco said: I am confident my boys will get off to a positive start in defending the title, he said. On Mirandas injury, Colaco said: It does hurt the team but we have to accept the reality. Ranty, who has been named the captain of the team, will spearhead the attack along with Chidi in the match.

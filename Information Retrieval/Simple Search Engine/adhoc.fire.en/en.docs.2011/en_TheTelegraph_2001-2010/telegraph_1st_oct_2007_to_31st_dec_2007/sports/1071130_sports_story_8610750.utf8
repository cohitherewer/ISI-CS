 BCCI may discuss Kirsten comments
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Gary Kirsten Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) bigwigs look set to discuss Gary Kirstens derogatory comments about the country, made 11 years ago, when they meet here on Saturday. The South African has already been offered the Team India coachs job, but nothing stops the BCCI from having a rethink. Im not aware of the terms and conditions offered to Kirsten However, its possible that somebody is going to raise the issue of his comments A discussion is likely, is what former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindra said on Thursday evening. Hes arriving on Friday, the opening day of Test No.2 against Pakistan. Kirsten had been critical of everything Indian in his tour diary for SA Cricket Action after the 1996-97 trip. It was first reported by The Telegraph on January 4, 1997, and published again on Wednesday. Since then, of course, other publications and a host of TV channels have been focusing on Kirstens comments. Obviously, nobody in the BCCI bothered to run a check before inviting Kirsten for a hush-hush interview late on Monday or else the Sharad Pawars wouldnt have courted him. Among other things, in the tour diary headlined Two Water Buffalo Steaks Please, Kirsten had been quoted as saying: (a) Sixty-two days in a country where westernised living conditions are regarded a luxury is no task for the faint-hearted and (b) To spread cricket to all corners of India, we played in what could politely be described as one-horse towns, places with more cows on the street than cars. There were other rather disgusting comments too. Footnote: Kirstens tour diary, by the way, was one of the topics for discussion during Wednesdays dinner hosted by former India opener Arun Lal. Anil Kumble and Co. were the guests of honour.

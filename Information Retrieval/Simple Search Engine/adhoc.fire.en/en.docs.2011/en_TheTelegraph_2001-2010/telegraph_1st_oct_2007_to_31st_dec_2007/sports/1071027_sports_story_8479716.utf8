 Davydenko warned for not trying
 Davydenko St Petersburg: Top seed Nikolay Davydenko, already interviewed over a suspicious match earlier this year, said he was warned for not playing hard enough by the chair umpire in his three-set loss to Marian Cilic at the St Petersburg Open. Davydenko won the first set in 27 minutes, but drew a rebuke from chair umpire Jean-Philippe Dercq in the third set before succumbing 6-1, 5-7, 1-6. When I committed a double fault, he gave me a notice for wrong behaviour on the court as if I was throwing the match, Davydenko said. I was surprised. Ive never heard anything like this before. No matter how Id played, no matter what had happened to me, I was never given such a notice. The ATP is investigating a match in August in which online gambling site Betfair voided bets on a match in Poland involving the Russian because of irregular betting patterns. Davydenko withdrew from that match against 87th-ranked Martin Vassallo Arguello in the third set because of a foot injury. Davydenko said that during the exchange, Dercq asked him about his condition, but Davydenko first said there was nothing wrong and later said the problem was in his legs. He could not have solved my problem, thats why I first told him I was okay, but I didnt play the way I did in the first set, thats why he gave me a notice, Davydenko said. Later I told him that my legs have collapsed. I could not move. Cilics victory was the second in seven weeks against Davydenko. It was very tough for me, the 102nd-ranked Cilic said of the first set. He was making winners almost from everywhere. But Cilic levelled the match when the world No. 4 made four double faults in the second set. The Russian double-faulted thrice in the third game to fall behind 0-3 in the third set and draw Dercqs warning. I felt I wanted, but could not (win), Davydenko said. It really knocked me out and I lost my serve and the second set and psychologically I was no longer on the court. I was completely switched off. Its a rare thing but it did happen. The Russian qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai next month after winning the Kremlin Cup two weeks ago. (AP)

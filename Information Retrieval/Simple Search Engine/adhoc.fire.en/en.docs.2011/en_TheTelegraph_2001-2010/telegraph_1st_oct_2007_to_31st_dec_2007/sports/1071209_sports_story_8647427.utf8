 Bagan get first win as Bhutia nets two

A STAFF REPORTER
 Bhaichung Bhutia exults after scoring one of his two goals versus Air India on Saturday. A Telegraph picture 
Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia came to Mohun Bagans rescue as they registered their maiden win in the ONGC I-League against Air India at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Two outstanding goals in the 22nd and 86th minutes helped them to victory. It was also Bhutias first goal in the League. 
The proceedings started with Air India enjoying control and Mohun Bagan banking mostly on counter attacks. The first goal was a result of one such counter attack. P.C. Lalawmpuia put the ball inside the box from the left and Bhaichung made no mistake in unleashing a rightfooter that bulged the netting. 
Even after getting the goal early, Mohun Bagan never looked comfortable. Their defence failed to keep a leash on Samson Singh on the left. But Air India lost control once they were in the penetrating zone. Mohun Bagans central defender N.S. Manju made up for the mistakes by his teammates. 
The script didnt change much after the break. The green-and-maroon players looked enthusiastic but missed sitters on a number of occasions. Barreto, who was playing from the deep created some gilt-edged chances for Bhaichung and Lalawmpuia, but were simply outnumbered by defenders Nirmal Chhetri, Dhanchandra Singh, Uttam Singh and Napolean Singh. 
Napoleans crosses from the left often made life difficult for the Mohun Bagan defenders. 
In the 58th minute, the Bhaichung-Barreto combination set it up for Lalawmpuia but his rightfooter missed the upright. 
The second goal was a result of good co-ordination by Barreto and Bhaichung. Barretos through into the open space found Bhaichung, who dodged past Dhanchandra Singh and placed the ball to the side of the diving goalie. 
Down 0-2, still Air India tried to salvage some pride but lack of finishing let them down. In the dyeing moments of the match, Narendra Meetei had a chance of reducing the margin but he failed to keep the ball within the framework after getting it inside the box.

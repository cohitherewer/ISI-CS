 Despite failures, Dravid likely to keep berth
 - Kartik injures right thumb, says hes praying LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly in Mumbai on Tuesday. (AFP) Mumbai: The series has been lost, but the Team India think tank appears reluctant to drop an out of form Rahul Dravid and give youngster Rohit Sharma a rare opportunity. Dravid, who decided not to continue as captain after the tour of England, has contributed no more than 51 in five matches (he didnt bat in Bangalore) of the Future Cup. According to The Telegraphs sources, no decision had been taken till Tuesday night, but the tone of somebody associated with the selection process suggested status quo would be maintained when the XI for the final ODI is finalised. While Dravid is set to be retained, theres talk that Sreesanth may be dropped. The think tank, it seems, believes Rudra Pratap Singh, who swings the ball prodigiously, would be a better bet at the Wankhede. But, then, all three new ball-bowlers (others being Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan) will then again be left-handers Not that the variety provided by Sreesanth, who made a comeback in Nagpur the other day, made any difference. To add to the think tanks problems, left-arm spinner Murali Kartik injured his right thumb during Tuesdays nets. Its swollen and part of the nail has also come off Its throbbing right now Hopefully, I should be okay Im praying, he said, speaking exclusively. Kartik, MoM in the last Test against Australia here (late 2004), got injured while fielding. If hes ruled out, then the think tank could opt for an extra seamer in Rudra Pratap or an extra batsman in Mumbaikar Sharma. Up 4-1, the Australians are either going to retain the XI which wrapped up the series in Nagpur or bring back Matthew Hayden, who missed that match because of a hip strain. Matthew trained at 85-95 per cent today, but we wont be taking a decision till the morning We want to see how he pulls up, pointed out captain Ricky Ponting. If Hayden is fit, then Brad Haddin will have to go out. Ponting promised his team wouldnt let up just because the series had been pocketed. Weve played some excellent cricket, particularly in the last two ODIs (Vadodara, Nagpur) Its not that we came to seek vengeance for the World Twenty20 defeat, we came to play well and become better cricketers Commenting on a rather astonishing achievement  his spinners doing better than the Indians, Ponting said: I dont know whether its because our spinners have bowled better or our batsmen have played the Indians better (Brad) Hogg is our most underrated player Hes 36, but continues to learn and his wrong un has been hard to pick. On the gamesmanship issue, Pontings reaction was Enough Just about enough when somebody raised it during his interaction with the media. I think people should focus on the positives of this series, not the negatives In Nagpur, for example, we had a great game of cricket Incidentally, Wednesdays day-night match is going to be the Wankhedes last international fixture for some years as its going to be renovated for the 2011 World Cup. So, will the series final ODI mark the last appearance, in India colours, of the Big Three there? Perhaps, that factor alone may actually help attract a big crowd. Its rare for the ground staff to get attention, but former India cricketer Sudhir Naik and his men deserve compliments for ensuring that the Wankhede recovered from the damage during last months World Twenty20-winning teams felicitation.

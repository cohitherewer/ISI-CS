 Yuvraj: Ive got to respond to situations, not expectations
 -  Twenty20s the toughest... The pace is too hectic, says Team India vice-captain 
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 		Yuvraj SinghKochi: Come Wednesday and Yuvraj Singh will complete seven years as a big league-cricketer. While the 25-year-old has often made headlines, the biggest have been in recent weeks, thanks to his stellar role in Indias World Twenty20 triumph. Vice-captain for the ODIs and in Twenty20, Yuvraj spoke to The Telegraph on Monday afternoon. The following are excerpts On whether, with all the moolah coming in (over Rs 2 crore from the BCCI, including his share of the prize money), hes looking for a financial adviser (Laughs) No... No... My mom (Shabnam) is very good in these matters... I have one in-house! Whats most pleasing is the recognition Ive got, not so much the actuals of the reward... One dreams of being part of a World Cup-winning team and that got realised last week... This appreciation is like the icing on a cake. On whether theres enough space in his garage for a Porsche to join a Mercedes, BMW and a Honda CR-V Well... Space has to be found... I havent decided on its colour... It could either be red or black... Right now, its time to focus on this Australia series. On non-cricketers being upset with the rewards for cricketers Winners in other sport too should be rewarded. Why not? Obviously, the other associations arent strong. On whether the environment around him has changed in the past week Well, there are more people talking about me... After the six sixes, theyre seeing me as an entertainer, but I realise peoples memory is short... Were feted as heroes when we win, rubbished when we dont. For most, what really matters is the today or the past week, not anything else. On whether the disappointment of having lost the 2003 World Cup final (to Australia) is now a thing of the distant past That disappointment is going to remain... That just wasnt our day... I must say South Africa has been quite lucky for us and, this time, we took a lot of confidence from beating Australia in the semi-finals... The Australians, after all, win most of the tournaments. On his emotions during last Mondays World Twenty20 final against Pakistan The one thought which kept coming to mind is that I shouldnt be part of an XI which lost another World Cup final... That, somehow, we had to win this as one may never again be in the final of a World Cup or a World Twenty20... On whether hed been tense when Misbah-ul Haq began clearing the boundary Frankly, I was nervous... Couldnt have taken another World Cup loss at the same ground (Wanderers)... Id been at point, but moved myself to long-off in case a big hit went in that region... My mind went blank when Sreesanth took the catch... Then, seeing my teammates run, even I ran... Its very difficult to describe those first few moments. On what made the difference in our World Twenty20 campaign The fielding... We had a young team... Also, our bowlers were very good throughout... Harbhajan (Singh) and Irfan (Pathan) were making their India comeback, but never showed as if they were under pressure... They performed in key moments... Then, somebody like Gautam (Gambhir) was so consistent with the bat. On the find of the tournament Rohit Sharma... He comes through as lazy during nets, but turned in a superb performance versus South Africa...His temperament, range of shots and even his fielding was fantastic that evening. He was a revelation. On six sixes in that Stuart Broad over As Ive said, I wanted to do something which would relieve me of the burden of having been hit for five sixes at the (Brit) Oval ODI by Dimitri Mascarenhas... Im happy I got six in six in a must-win match. On whether hed like to be remembered for that world record alone A world record is a world record, but Ill be more happy if I add to my Test hundreds (he has two) and people find them special. On whether hes worried that, now, fans are going to expect a flurry of sixes each time he takes guard I can only do my best. On a section of the media harping on his so-called disappointment at not getting the India captaincy (in the World Twenty20 and ODIs) Its an honour to captain the country and anybody who plays for his country would like to lead... But (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni is the captain and its important to put the team first in every respect and back him... We havent spoken about the captaincy, but theres no problem between Dhoni and me. On Dhoni as captain He consults everybody and thats a good quality... Hes just won the World Twenty20 and should be given the time and space to settle down. Whether its Dhoni or me or somebody else, whats important is to take the team forward. Look, a captain will be remembered as good only if he does that. On being Dhonis deputy I try and take as much pressure off him as possible... Whatever the responsibility, Im comfortable. On just how tough is Twenty20 Its the toughest, believe me... The pace is too hectic and theres no breathing space... Youve got to hit every ball, youve got to run on every ball and, if youre a bowler, youve got to make sure you dont get hit on every ball... The paying public gets entertained, but youve got to spare a thought for the players... After all the Twenty20, Saturdays ODI seemed like a five-day Test match! (After a pause) Actually, because their expectations are now so high, fans at home are going to make the Twenty20 even tougher for us players. On the ICCs move to limit Twenty20 face-offs Yes, it must not be overdone... The matches ought to be spaced out, say a couple every six months... Twenty20 is okay for fun, but I wouldnt say its real cricket... Moreover, dont forget were already playing too much. On having to sit out of the Test XIs Its definitely frustrating, but making the XI isnt in my hands... My job is to keep working hard, to stay focused... The top players regard Test cricket to be the real thing... Thats the biggest stage for me as well... (After a pause) Theres God and, eventually, things get balanced out. So... Finally, on his mantra for not being overwhelmed by added pressure (Laughs again) Yeah, now, everybody is calling me Mr Six... Its nice to have such a label, but the way out is not to treat the high expectations as added pressure... Ive got to respond to situations, not expectations... Of course, Im aware of the need to be consistent.

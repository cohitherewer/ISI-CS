 Liverpool, Arsenal post wins
London: Late goals from William Gallas and Tomas Rosicky gave Premier League leaders Arsenal a 2-0 win over Wigan Athletic on Saturday as champions Manchester United slipped to a 0-1 defeat at Bolton Wanderers. Steven Gerrard inspired Liverpool to a 3-0 victory at Newcastle United while Manchester Citys remarkable home record was maintained when they struck late to beat Reading 2-1 and move just one point behind United. Portsmouths fine campaign shows no sign of petering out after they beat Birmingham City 2-0 to push Chelsea down into sixth place. Everton thrashed Sunderland 7-1 at Goodison Park to leave Roy Keanes side in the bottom-three while Middlesbrough are hovering just above the relegation zone after a 0-3 home loss to Aston Villa. Second-bottom Wigan held on doggedly for 83 minutes at a subdued Emirates Stadium before Gallas headed in a Bacary Sagna cross, then Rosicky added a little gloss after being set up by substitute Nicklas Bendtner. United had not lost a league game at Bolton since 1978 but they came up against a side who have begun to show signs of life under new manager Gary Megson. The champions were stung after 11 minutes when Nicolas Anelka turned sharply to score his seventh league goal of the season. Despite lots of possession United struggled to break down a defiant Bolton side. (Reuters)

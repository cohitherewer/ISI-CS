 Sasi up in World Cup
Khanty-Mansiysk (Russia): Grandmaster K. Sasikiran edged out Bulgarian Grandmaster Sergei Zigalko in a blitz game to become the only Indian to make it to the second round of the chess World Cup here. However, other Indians failed to make it through to the tie-breaks to advance in the elite event. GM G.N. Gopal put up a brave fight before losing to former world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov. Gopal, who had drawn both his classical games against his celebrated opponent, also managed to hold his own in the rapid games. Kasimdzhanov finally prevailed in the blitz games 1.5-0.5. Harikrishna made a disappointing exit from the World Cup when he lost his rapid tie-break match 0.5-1.5 to GM Zhao Jun of China. Abhijit Kunte lost the rapid match 0.5-1.5 to Russian GM Vadim Zvjaginsev. Commonwealth champion Grandmaster Nigel Short bowed out of the World Cup with a 0.5-1.5 loss in the rapid games to German Grandmaster David Barmidze. Russian Grandmaster Alexander Khalifman was another surprise loser. He lost the rapid match to compatriot Alexander Belov and crashed out. Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine made a strong comeback against IM Essam el Gindy of Egypt and advanced to the second round with a 1.5-0.5 victory in the rapid tie-breaks. Evgeny Alekseev brushed off an early scare in his first classical game against Ismagambetov and won their match in the rapid games. Sasikiran played well in the endgame to outwit his opponent when the clash was heading towards a draw. He obtained a slight advantage with the white pieces against the Queens Indian defence. The middle-game was hard-fought and Zivalgo prevented Sasikiran from making significant progress. The Indian continued to enjoy a slightly superior position in the endgame, but a draw seemed likely. However, Sasikiran was in no mood to concede a draw easily. (PTI)

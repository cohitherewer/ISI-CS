 Hot reception awaits India in Perth
 - Dennis (Lillee) is clear in his mind that Waca must regain its fearsome reputation: Yardley LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Dennis Lillee Calcutta: The wicket at the Western Australia Cricket Association (Waca) Ground in Perth could be the fastest in years when the Indians get there in January for Test No. 3 of the four-match series. The Test is to be played from January 16. According to former Australia allrounder and ex-Sri Lanka coach Bruce Yardley, curator Cameron Sutherland has been instructed by Waca president Dennis Lillee to once again prepare wickets which wont just be the quickest anywhere on the circuit, but have the maximum bounce as well. Dennis is clear in his mind that the Waca Ground must regain its fearsome reputation and, so, the curator has been working towards that for the past couple of seasons, Yardley told The Telegraph. Yardley is in India as a commentator for the ongoing Indo-Pak series. Till the late Eighties, Perth and Sabina Park in Kingston had the most pace and bounce. Sabina Park is still fast, but doesnt exactly make batsmen go weak in the knees. The Waca Ground remains the quickest in Australia, but hasnt really been that intimidating for some time now. It could, of course, all change when we get there in seven weeks. Yardley, who turned out for Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield (now the Pura Cup), has been working with the present-day spinners there. The province, incidentally, is coached by Tom Moody. I did some pre-season work and found the practice wickets in Perth to be really fast and bouncy... The main wicket, clearly, cant be any different, Yardley added. The Indians have, so far, played two Tests at the Waca Ground and both ended in defeats  by two wickets in 1977-78 (when Bishan Singh Bedi was captain and Jeff Thomson was spearheading the Australian attack) and a massive 300 runs in 1991-92 (under Mohammed Azharuddin). While India lost big the last time, Sachin Tendulkar scripted a classic 114, his third Test hundred. Since then, he has added a wowing 34 to that column. Looking ahead, the good thing perhaps is that Perth isnt hosting the first Test of the 2007-08 series and the Indians will get there after having spent three weeks in Australia. The last India-Australia Test series in Australia (2003-04) ended 1-1.

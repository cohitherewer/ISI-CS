 Nurse tried to revive Woolmer
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES Bob Woolmer Kingston: Several attempts to save the life of former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer were unsuccessful, a nurse told the coroners inquest here. Novelette Robinson, a registered nurse, who was assigned to the medical team for the Jamaica leg of the World Cup, said several attempts were made to save Woolmers life after he was found in his hotel room unconscious on the morning of March 18. Robinson said when she rushed to Woolmers room she was surprised not to see him on his bed. He was found naked in the bathroom. Before entering the bathroom, she said blood stains were seen on the bed. She said she made her way into the bathroom, which first proved difficult because Woolmers body was blocking the door. The first thing I felt for was the pulse, but there was none, then there was no response from the chest, she told coroner Patrick Murphy and the 11-member jury. She said she administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and chest compression, but this did not work. Robinson added that Dr Asher Cooper arrived shortly after and he too administered CPR, this again failed. She also told the inquest that the ambulance did not arrive at the hotel until about 11:40 am, almost one hour after she entered Woolmers room. The coach was pronounced dead at the University Hospital of the West Indies. Dr Herb Elliott, in a television interview on Tuesday, said when he entered Woolmers room, the coach was still alive. It is not clear if he arrived before or after the nurse, but he is expected to testify later at the inquest. An autopsy report by government pathologist, Dr Ere Seshiah, ruled that Woolmer died from asphyxia caused by manual strangulation. But another examination by Dr Nathaniel Carey, of the metropolitan police in London, showed he died from heart failure. Ill-health led to Woolmers death, he said at an inquest in Kingston. An enlarged heart, fluid in the lungs and blood on a pillow in the hotel room provided further evidence. Meanwhile, the hotels information systems manager Lorraine Taite, who also took the stand, told the inquest that the teams physiotherapist Maurice Stephensons room was opposite Woolmers, but requested to be relocatedbecause he could not take the noise coming from nearby. His request was granted. Taite said after he was relocated, the key (swipe card) was used to enter the same room he moved from, but could not say who would have re-entered the room. She was unable to say if another guest was given that room.

 Now, Gary Kirsten is BCCIs No. 1 choice
 - South African offered two-year contract LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI KirstenCalcutta: Eleven years after being highly critical of the country, South African Gary Kirsten (a one-time stand-in captain) has emerged the latest No. 1 choice for the Team India coachs job. The ball, indeed, is in the 40-year-old left-handers court. Kirsten has been offered a two-year contract and his basic salary could be in the region of $300,000 annually. The coachs post has been vacant since early April, when Greg Chappell decided not to seek an extension. Since then, of course, weve had a series of cricket managers  Ravi Shastri, Chandu Borde and Lalchand Rajput. Borde and Shastri are former captains. In what came as a surprise, the Sharad Pawar-headed Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) interviewed Kirsten in New Delhi late on Monday. It was a hush-hush affair, much in contrast to the popping of flashbulbs in Chennai, some five months ago, when Graham Ford and John Emburey were interviewed. Ford, also a South African, initially agreed to come on board. Less than 48 hours later, however, the BCCI was left red-faced as he conveyed his regrets. Such is the BCCIs functioning that Kirsten was interviewed soon after secretary Niranjan Shah informed the media There is no need to hold a meeting The (special) committee members can discuss over the phone and take a decision. So much for Pawars pledge to be transparent. The interview was conducted by six members of the seven-man committee having responsibility for finding Chappells successor. Besides Pawar, Shah and BCCI treasurer N. Srinivasan, the three one-time captains  Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar and Shastri  were present. Joint-secretary Mohinder Pandove was the sole absentee. Interestingly, Test captain Anil Kumble was a special invitee. Strangely, the ODI and Twenty20 captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, wasnt called. According to Shastri, the interview (which took place at Pawars 6 Janpath residence) lasted around 30 minutes. Were negotiating with Gary At this stage, it wont be proper to say anything more We dont need to rush and he has been given time Everything will be clear in a week, Shastri told The Telegraph. He dismissed speculation that hed been the one to do all the pre-interview talking with Kirsten. No All of us on the committee spoke to him Shastri added: To put the record straight, I didnt meet Gary during the World Twenty20 in South Africa. Still, whats more likely is that the former captains, particularly Gavaskar and Shastri himself, did the spadework. As a batsman, Kirsten has been one of the greats (strongly influenced by Allan Border) of the modern era, but little is known about his credentials as coach. What we do know is that he was Cricket South Africas High- Performance Manager for a couple of years and has been associated with academies. Kirsten, by the way, has confirmed that he wasnt on the list of 20- 22 to have formally applied to the BCCI. Given that we have a specialist bowling coach (Venkatesh Prasad), it has been taken for granted that Chappells successor, too, is going to be a batsman. Rajputs term ends with the third and final Test of the ongoing series, in Bangalore, and the BCCI is keen that Kirsten makes himself available from the start of the series in Australia. The first Test, which begins on Boxing Day, is in Melbourne.EXCERPTS FROM KIRSTEN rsquo;S  1996-97 INDIA TOUR DIARY Sixty-two days in a country where westernised living conditions are regarded a luxury is no task for the faint-hearted. To spread cricket to all corners of India, we played in what could politely be classed as one-horse towns, places with more cows on the street than cars. I rsquo;ll never forget arriving in Rajkot mdash; laughter broke out in the bus when we were told we had reached our hotel, yet there didn rsquo;t seem to be one in sight. It was actually above another building hellip; A sense of humour is a necessity on this tour. Travelling was an interesting experience: There was seldom a direct flight to our next destination hellip; To expect teams to perform at consistently high levels when faced with such arrangements is absurd and unfair on the players, who are judged on every single performance. Food is a major topic of conversation in India. In a westernised country, you survive on certain types of food which are virtually non-existent here. We tried some of the local meat (in Ahmedabad) but when we were told it was water buffalo mdash; we tended to stay away from red meat after that. Socialising in India is pretty much hotel-bound mdash; there are no real places to go out. It gets quite boring and tedious trying to occupy yourself mdash; one of the rigours of touring India. There are very few new cars, and most are dented and in bad shape. There rsquo;s no point in having a decent car in India because it will get wrecked in no time. There are people sleeping on the streets, and acres and acres of slums and shack dwellings. Note: Published in the December 1996-January 1997 issue of SA Cricket Action.

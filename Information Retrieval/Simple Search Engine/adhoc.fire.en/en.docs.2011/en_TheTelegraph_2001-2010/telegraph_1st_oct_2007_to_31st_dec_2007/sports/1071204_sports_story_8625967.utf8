 Itll be one helluva battle for Pak
RAMIZ AT EDEN Misbah and Samis partnership cant just be evaluated in terms of the number of runs it produced. The real value of the seventh-wicket stand was the time and number of overs it consumed. By first avoiding the follow-on and going on to bat for three hours and 43.2 overs, the Pakistani pair consumed valuable time from the Indian second innings. Had the Indians got about 20 overs more to bat before stumps on Day IV, their lead would have been in the vicinity of 360-370 already and Kumble could have thought of an overnight declaration. As things stand, the Indians will have to bat on the final morning. If I was in Kumbles shoes, I would look to declare after adding about 25 runs in six-seven overs. That would give Pakistan a target of 325 at approximately four runs an over, which I think would keep them interested. The Indians scored at just under four runs an over in the second half of Mondays play. I heard some say that it was too slow, but believe me, scoring at a faster rate was not easy. Dhoni and Sourav  who were promoted to up the tempo  tried their best but couldnt do any better. Driving Kaneria out of the rough was a nightmare for both right-handers and left-handers. Batting aggressively is not easy now. There is no pace, the bounce is variable and the ball is turning. But one can still survive on this pitch with a common sense approach, as Sami showed. All this must be kept in mind when the Indian thinktank decide on declaration strategy. The way Misbah has performed in this series, he comes through as captaincy material. He knows how to handle high-pressure situations, he has a sense of responsibility, possesses an abundance of skill and grace, and most importantly, is respected in the dressing room. He just needs to fine-tune his technique against short-pitched bowling, which is not a big ask from a sensible cricketer. Misbah is my pick to be the Pakistan captain in six months time. He is 33 but since he hasnt played too much international cricket, he should be given some time to grow at this level. No praise will be too high for Sami. I have always maintained that all teams should have three-dimensional cricketers: a batsman needs to bowl, a bowler needs to bat and everyone needs to field well. Sami is a great example of my ideal 3D cricketer. He gives his everything whenever he is on the field and is a captains dream. An ideal role model for budding cricketers as well. Talking of fielding, the majority in this Indian team lack athleticism and agility. If India fail to win this Test, they will surely rue the missed chances. Akmal, Misbah and Sami  the trio who have thwarted India  all benefited from sloppy Indian catching. If they dont improve substantially, the Indians will get exposed against better teams like Australia. The Indians have a chance to show they are, indeed, a top side by setting Pakistan a reasonable target (325) and not bat too long. And Pakistan? Well, they should go out there thinking they can win it. They should neither be ultra-defensive nor ultra-aggressive. It will be one helluva battle for Pakistan. They will have to bat out of their skins to win, or even draw this Test.

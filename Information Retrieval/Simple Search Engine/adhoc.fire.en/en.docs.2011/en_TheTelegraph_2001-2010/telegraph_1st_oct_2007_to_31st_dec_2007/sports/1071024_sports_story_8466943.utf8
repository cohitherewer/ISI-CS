 Jonty: India not far behind Aussies, SA in fielding
Faisalabad: Jonty Rhodes said on Tuesday that a top fielding side was an indication of good team spirit and unity. Rhodes, now the fielding coach of South Africa, was pleased that more importance was being given to fielding than it was 10 years ago. There is no doubt that fielding has now become an important part of any teams planning, training and strategies. It has taken on a new dynamism and spirit in recent years, said Rhodes. Rhodes said the Australians had laid a lot of emphasis on good throwing techniques, which not only prevented runs but even injuries as it did not strain the shoulders and elbows. It is good to see subcontinental teams also laying lot of emphasis on fielding and hiring specialists for this job. I think India have improved a lot in this area and is not far behind Australia and South Africa, he said. (PTI)

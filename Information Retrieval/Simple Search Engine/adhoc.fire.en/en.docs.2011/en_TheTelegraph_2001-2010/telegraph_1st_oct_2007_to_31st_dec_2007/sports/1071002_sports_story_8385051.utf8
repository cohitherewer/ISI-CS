 US triumph in Presidents Cup 
Montreal: Phil Mickelson, Scott Verplank and Stewart Cink won the deciding matches to bring the US their first Presidents Cup away victory over the Internationals. The Americans won 19  to 14 , improving 5-1-1 against their non-European rivals. We came into this week with a little score to settle in the international golf arena and I think we showed everybody that we can play again, saidCink, whose 6-and-4 victory over Australian Nick Hern provided the clinching point on Sunday. Mickelson beat Fijis Vijai Singh 5 and 4 and Verplank beat South African Rory Sabbatini 2 and 1. With most of the attention focused on Canadian Mike Weirs 1-up victory over world No. 1 Tiger Woods, there was little fanfare at the 14th hole when Cink closed out the team triumph. Im happy to be the one to clinch the Cup, Cink said. Once Cink pushed the US across the line at Royal Montreal Golf Club, the Internationals finished well but victories by Weir, Australian Adam Scott, Argentinas Angel Cabrera and South Korean K.J. Choi only shrank the final gap. (AFP)

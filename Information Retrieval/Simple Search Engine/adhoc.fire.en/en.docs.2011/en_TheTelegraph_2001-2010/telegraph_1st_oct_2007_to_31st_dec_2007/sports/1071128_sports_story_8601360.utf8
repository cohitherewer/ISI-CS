 Confident Dempo take on Sporting
Margao: Dempo SC will seek to maintain their winning momentum when they take on Sporting Clube-de-Goa in their Round II outing of the ONGC I-League at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Wednesday. Dempo, who won the NFL last season, never felt the absence of Clifford Miranda in their impressive 3-0 win over Salgaocar in the league opener on Saturday. Striker Edeh Chidi, who scored a brace, and Ranty Martins, who also found the net, are in fine form. Nicolau Borges, who replaced Clifford Miranda, has worked tirelessly along with Anthony Pereira on the flanks and with good support from Climax Lawerence and Roberto Silva, the midfield looked solid. On the other hand, Sporting started their campaign on a disappointing note losing 0-3 to Churchill Brothers. With a single foreign striker, Junior Elijah, their attack lacked sting in the absence of Dudu Omagbemi. They will have to raise their game if they want to trouble the strong Dempo defence. It was a good start, but we cannot take Sporting lightly after their loss against Churchill. We need to be more focussed and play as a unit if we are to put it across Sporting, Dempo coach Armando Colaco said. Sporting technical director Peter Vales said, We have to forget about the past and be positive. I have faith in my boys who can turn the tables if they play to their potential.  (PTI)

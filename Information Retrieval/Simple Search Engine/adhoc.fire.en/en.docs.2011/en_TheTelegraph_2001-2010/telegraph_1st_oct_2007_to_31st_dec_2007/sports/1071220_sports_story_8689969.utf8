 Sehwag to try out lighter bat

Melbourne: Virender Sehwag is banking on a lighter bat and special practice balls to regain the devastating form which made him such a feared opener all over the world. 
The Delhi batsman, who made the cut for the Test series Down Under despite not being named among the 24 probables, flew in to Australia with a set of bats each of which is lighter by 90-100 gms and a box of balls of two colours. 
A lighter bat will allow him to play punishing strokes freely. The coloured balls are intended to help him sight the ball quicker and better in the nets, so that he regains confidence before going out to the middle. 
How Sehwag will fit into the Test XI, though, remains to be seen. Wasim Jaffer will take one of the opening slots, while Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S. Laxman and Yuvraj Singh are certainties as well. (PTI)

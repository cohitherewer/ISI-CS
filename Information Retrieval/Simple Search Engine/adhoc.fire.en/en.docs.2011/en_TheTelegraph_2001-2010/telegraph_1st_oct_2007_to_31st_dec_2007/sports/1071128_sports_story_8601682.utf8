 Malik needs support: Farhat
Gurgaon: As Shoaib Malik feels the heat with Pakistan trailing 0-1 in the three-Test series, he has found some support from former teammate Imran Farhat, who thinks the young captain has it in him to steer the unpredictable side. At 25, I think Malik is very young but has enough experience to lead the team. He should be backed in tough times. It is not easy to lead Pakistan, Farhat said. We started our careers together. He is a nice guy and quite capable of handling the team, he added in support of his ex-teammate, who has been criticised for Pakistans ODI series loss and the defeat in the first Test against India. Farhat, who signed up with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) after getting frustrated with the selectors back home, said the politics within the PCB makes it difficult for any captain to function independently. Its nasty. They (the board and the selectors) target you for no fault of yours and keep you out even if you perform. I am a victim of it. But I think Malik has the backing. He has been made captain till next December but in Pakistan you never know, he quipped. Farhat, however, felt Malik still has to overcome a lot of shortcomings before becoming an undisputed leader. He needs to be stronger, assert himself more and not allow the pressure to build on himself. All this will take time, he said. Farhat, who would be playing for Chandigarh Lions in the ICL, revealed that he was asked by the PCB to terminate his contract with the rebel venture and return to the side for last months home series against South Africa. But I refused It would have been very unprofessional and amounted to breach of contract. I want to play for Pakistan but not by giving up my contract with ICL. I cannot be that irresponsible, the opener said. The 25-year-old does not have faith in the current selection panel headed by Salahuddin Ahmed and said several talented players were suffering because of their favouritism. I am not in his (Ahmed) good books and that has cost me. But I am not a person who would plead his case without backing it up with performance. I have done well at the domestic level and they will have to explain why I have been kept out for so long, while some others have been given chance after chance. It was the same earlier as well, senior players were not dropped as the selectors wanted to persist with experience while talents like Misbah-ul Haq had to wait for ages to come to the national side. This is not fair, he added. On the PCB threatening to ban players joining ICL, farhat said the rigid stand of the board was completely uncalled for. They have not banned me from playing domestic cricket I just completed a season there. But it would be unfortunate if they ban players. I dont think it would serve any purpose, he said.  (PTI)

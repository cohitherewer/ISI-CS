A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: The working committee of the CAB has decided on the three sub-committees for the second India-Pakistan Test commencing on November 30. CAB president Prasun Mukherjee, who will head the organising committee, will work in tandem with sports minister Subhas Chakraborty (chairman, steering committee) and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami (chairman, stadium committee). The CAB is also planning to have a parade of former captains on a golf cart before the start of the match. Three former captains Chandu Borde, Ajit Wadekar and Gundappa Viswanath have already confirmed that they would turn up. Former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal will be a special guest. However, former captains Mansur Ali Khan Patuadi, Bishan Singh Bedi, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri have informed the CAB that they would not be able to attend the function, added Mukherjee. According to Mukherjee, this time special emphasis will be given on improving food stalls inside the stadium. The CAB is likely to distribute tickets to the affiliated units for the second Test on Friday. The selectors also had a meeting to discuss Bengals poor performance in the Ranji Trophy tie against Baroda. Chief selector Arup Bhattacharya said they would announce the squad for the match against Punjab on Friday. The match will be played in Siliguri.

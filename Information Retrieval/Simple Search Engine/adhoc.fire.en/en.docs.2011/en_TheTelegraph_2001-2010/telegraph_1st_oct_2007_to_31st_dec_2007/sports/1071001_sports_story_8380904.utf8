 Team Rohan loses
MARIO RODRIGUES Richard Gasquet after winning the singles title on Sunday Mumbai: Top seed Richard Gasquet clinched the Kingfisher Airlines Open title with a 6-3, 6-4 victory on Sunday. But it was Olivier Rochus who won the hearts of the nearly houseful audience at the CCI centre court with his fighting qualities and never-say-die attitude. The 21-year-old world no. 14 Frenchman, who won the final in an hour and 26 minutes, walked away with the $ 65,850 winners cheque and 175 points while the 26-year-old Belgian had to settle for $ 35,500 and 120 points. This is the fifth career title in nine final appearances for the Wimbledon semi-finalist, while it is the fourth time that the world No. 66 Rochus has lost in six title rounds. In the doubles final, Swedens Robert Lindstedt and Jarkko Nieminen of Finland beat the Indo-Pak Express of Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5). It was their first triumph on the ATP circuit. They took home $20,250 while the losers pocketed $11,550. Incidentally, Bopanna was pipped at the post for the second year in succession, having lost in the company of Mustafa Ghouse to Mahesh Bhupathi and Mario Ancic in the final last year. There were several firsts for Gasquet on Sunday  his first title in 2007, his first on hard court (he has won on grass, clay and carpet earlier) and his first outside Europe and in Asia. This was a good tournament for me. I didnt lose a set and it proves that I can win on any surface, said the former world No. 7 whose aim will be to get back in the top 10 as soon as possible. But he admits he will have to improve his fitness for that to happen. The conditions were tough as I come from France and it was also a tough match for me as Rochus is a really talented player and has a great backhand. But I was confident and after being broken my aim was to make it 3-3 in the second set and not let him take the lead, which I achieved. After that, things fell in place, Gasquet stated. Gasquet looked solid from the beginning and it was no surprise when he broke Rochus serve in the second game of the first set to forge ahead. But thereafter he was content to just hang in there while the loser did all the running and provided most of the fireworks. In the second set, Rochus was broken in the first game but he broke right back in the next to level the score. Gasquet looked like he was wilting under the conditions but a crucial Rochus double fault in the seventh game at 15-40 helped the Frenchman seize the advantage again and go up 4-3. Thereafter Gasquet upped his game to close out the match with some big serves, delectable drops and forehand winners. Rochus may have been beaten but he was far from disgraced. It was a close match. Im very happy with the way I played, Rochus said.

 Rudi says sorry to Sangakkara
Hobart: South African umpire Rudi Koertzen has apologised to Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara after mistakenly giving him out on the final day of the sides second Test defeat against Australia . Sangakkara was just eight runs short of a double century when he was struck on paceman Stuart Clark. The ball ricocheted off his helmet to Ricky Ponting, who appealed for the catch, and Koertzen raised his finger to end Sangakkaras innings on 192.  (REUTERS)

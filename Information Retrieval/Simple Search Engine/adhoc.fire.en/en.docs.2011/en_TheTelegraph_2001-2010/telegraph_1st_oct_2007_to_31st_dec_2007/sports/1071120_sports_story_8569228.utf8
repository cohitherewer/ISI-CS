 Bedi: ODI series saw poor fare
 - Whats Chappell doing in India, asks former captain LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Bishan Singh Bedi at a function in Delhi on Monday. A Telegraph picture New Delhi: The just-ended Indo-Pak ODIs may have attracted a full house everywhere, but former India captain (and our first cricket manager) Bishan Singh Bedi is of the opinion that the quality of cricket was poor. Its not that we saw mediocre cricket. In fact, the quality was poor throughout with the victories being hollow... There wasnt one match where the spectators were really on edge... We couldve won 4-1 or even 5-0, but didnt, Bedi told The Telegraph. Speaking on Monday evening, before leaving for Australia in connection with a charity match organised by the David Hookes Foundation, Bedi added: Im not placing the entire blame on the players... Much of it has to be taken by the administrators for scheduling so much cricket... How can there be quality when theres so much of something? Bedi, of course, is hoping that the three-Test series will be high on quality. Meanwhile, at a book release function, Bedi questioned former coach Greg Chappells return to India, this time as director of the Rajasthan Cricket Associations Academy. Did he do so well with the Indian team that he now needs to work in Rajasthan? Whats he doing in India? Hes been going after the Board (through a documentary, Guru Greg), but theres not a soul to ask him to shut up... According to Bedi, there was a significant gap in the cricket knowledge between Chappell and the Team India players. They couldnt reach to where he was and, in turn, he was reluctant to stoop... To be fair to the man, he did have a lot to offer. Never an Establishment man, Bedi attacked the Board yet again. Theres always uncertainty in the corridors of Indian cricket... The right hand doesnt know what the left is doing and one doesnt have the slightest clue as to whats going to happen next. For now, at least, the last word is Bedis.

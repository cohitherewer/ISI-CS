(Reuters) Roger Federer was taking life very seriously as he began the defence of his Masters Cup title in Shanghai, the 1.8 million showcase event that is supposed to celebrate all that is good in tennis. But of more pressing concern is his wish to defend his friend Martina Hingis. Hingis announced her second retirement from the sport at the beginning of the month, revealing that she had tested positive for cocaine after her third-round defeat at Wimbledon. The former world No. 1 and holder of five Grand Slam titles is ready to fight to clear her name and denies ever having taken drugs. I cant ever imagine in any way that she took drugs, Federer said in an interview with a Swiss newspaper. I hope that she can prove her innocence. I support her. Federer, who was once a ball boy for Hingis, has been friends with his compatriot for many years. They played  and won  the Hopman Cup together back in 2000, which he still remembers with pride. I know she has said she was proud to have helped me at the beginning of my career, he said. At the time, playing in doubles with her, was a privilege for me.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Ill do whatever job demands: Kumble
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni with Test skipper Anil Kumble at the Kotla on Tuesday. (AFP) New Delhi: Anil Kumble returns to his happy hunting ground on Thursday hoping to begin his new innings as India Test captain on a high at the Kotla. I have fond memories of Delhi, naturally, Kumble said on Tuesday. I am happy that I will be making my debut as Test captain at this venue. I am confident we will win the Test. Indias last Test against Pakistan at the Kotla, in 1999, was a memorable one for Kumble. The leg-spinner bagged 10 wickets in an innings for only the second time in Test history (after Englishman Jim Laker). Speaking at a promotional, Kumble said he looked atthe captaincy as a challenge. Leading the country is always challenging, not only against Pakistan but against any team in the world, he said. As a player I always tried to give my best. The approach would be the same as captain. All I want to do is play my role successfully. Clearly, Kumble is determined to lead from the front. He smiled off a suggestion that he was an introvert, saying: I will do whatever the job demands. I do not shy away from my responsibilities. At 37, Kumble is the oldest member of the Indian squad. But that wont be a hindrance as far as interacting with the younger players is concerned. I never had any problem in that area. I have shared my moments with them and encouraged them. Asked what he thought of Ricky Pontings comment that he would be under pressure in Australia  if made the captain for that series as well  Indias highest Test wicket-taker shrugged and said: I dont want to react to what Ponting said.

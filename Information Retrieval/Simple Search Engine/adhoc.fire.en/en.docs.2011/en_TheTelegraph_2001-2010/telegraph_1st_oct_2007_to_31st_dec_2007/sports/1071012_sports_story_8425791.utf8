 Shoaib available for India tour
 Shoaib Akhtar in Lahore on Thursday. (AFP) Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday suspended fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar for 13 international matches on four indiscipline charges that included hitting teammate Mohammed Asif with a bat in South Africa last month. Akhtar was also given a Rs 34 lakh ($57,000) fine, Shafqat Naghmi, PCB chief operating officer and chairman of the disciplinary committee, said after a hearing. Shoaib Akhtar is banned for 13 international matches, Naghmi told a news conference. Akhtar has already served nine matches after missing seven World Twenty20 games in South Africa and the two home Test matches against South Africa, making him eligible for selection for the high-voltage tour of India in November-December. Before that, he will also be available for selection for the last of the five limited-overs game against South Africa later this month. The 13 match-ban and the fine is the highest-ever imposed on a Pakistani cricketer by the PCB apart from the life bans imposed on former captain Salim Malik and batsman Qasim Omar. I am not going to appeal against the ban, I am hungry to play for Pakistan, Akhtar told reporters. I have suffered enough, it was all in the heat of the moment and Ill be extra careful in the future, he added. Naghmi said Akhtar is one incident away from the end of his international career. If he is found guilty of any further act of indiscipline, he faces a life ban, Naghmi said. In addition to a fine and suspension, the PCB deducted 9.5 points from Akhtars 20 disciplinary points that are in the players central contract. Akhtar was sent home after he hit Asif with the bat at a practice session in Johannesburg during the World Twenty20 event. The other three charges against Akhtar were: missing a training camp in August and opting to play a charity match in England; giving statements against the PCB in various newspapers; and conducting an unauthorised press briefing on his return from South Africa. Akhtar in that press conference had said teammate Shahid Afridi had made comments after a practice session and the two became embroiled in a tussle. When Asif tried to break them up, Akhtar said he accidentally struck him with his bat. I have already apologised to Asif, to the whole nation and the PCB, now I just want to move on and concentrate on playing cricket for Pakistan, Akhtar said. I have been going through a nightmare for the last four weeks and I just dont want to even recall whatever happened. As if it was not enough, trouble also appeared in his personal life as his driver smashed up his new car and injured a motorcyclist in Lahore. Shoaibs driver Ramazan hit a motorcyclist when he came into his way and smashed the car into an electric pole on Wednesday. Naghmi said the PCB had through this case given a clear message to all players that while they would be adequately rewarded for their performances, no indiscipline would be tolerated from anyone no matter how big a player he is. We gave Shoaib permission to have a lawyer represent him in this case because we wanted fair play and justice for him. We hope he has learnt his lesson now and will be careful in this probation period, he said.  (AGENCIES)

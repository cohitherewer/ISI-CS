 Gunners rally to hold Liverpool

(AFP) London: Arsenal returned to the top of the Premier League on Sunday when they rallied for a 1-1 draw at Liverpool. Steven Gerrard put the home side ahead in the seventh minute with a fierce shot. But Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas hit his 10th goal of the season with 10 minutes left to ensure both sides continued their unbeaten starts to the Premier League season. Arsenal joined defending champions Manchester United, who beat Middlesbrough 4-1 on Saturday, on 26 points and with the same goal difference, but leads the standings having scored more goals. Liverpool dropped to sixth place on 20 points, while Blackburn moved up to fifth with a 2-1 win over Tottenham, which remained in the relegation zone after conceding an injury-time goal for the fifth time this season. Bolton moved up a place with a 1-1 draw against Aston Villa, while Derby replaced Bolton in last place after a 0-2 home loss to Everton. While Arsenal went into Sundays match at Anfield unbeaten in any competition since April, Liverpool were seeking a return to form after a 1-2 Champions League loss to Benfica in midweek. The Gunners, who routed Sparta Prague 7-0 on Tuesday, pressured Liverpool with their fast, accurate passing, but Gerrard drew a save from goalkeeper Manuel Almunia with a low shot before Liverpool took the lead from a free-kick move just outside the area. The kick was touched sideways to Gerrard, who smashed a shot through the defensive wall and into the net. Tottenham fired coach Martin Jol in midweek after the clubs poor start, but his replacement Juande Ramos watched from the stands and saw a performance typical of those that have blighted the clubs season. Tottenham led Blackburn at White Hart Lane through Robbie Keanes 49th-minute penalty kick, awarded for a foul on Aaron Lennon by Stephen Warnock. Tottenham peppered Blackburns goal with shots that either missed or were saved by goalkeeper Brad Friedel, but were unable to hold onto the lead. Benni McCarthy hit a 60th-minute equaliser that deflected off defender Michael Dawson and, in added time, Christopher Samba took advantage of another defensive lapse.  (AP)

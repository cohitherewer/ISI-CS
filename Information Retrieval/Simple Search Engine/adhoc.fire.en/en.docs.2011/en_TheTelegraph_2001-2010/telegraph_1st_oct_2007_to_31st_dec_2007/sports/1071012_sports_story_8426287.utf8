	Lahore: Mohammed Asif has been advised a week rsquo;s rest after he suffered an elbow injury during the second Test against South Africa. The Pakistan seamer could now miss the start of the one-day series against South Africa next week because of an elbow problem. Asif left the field during the second Test against the South Africans on Wednesday after bowling just four overs and MRI scans showed he had inflammation of the elbow.
 Doctors have told Asif he needs a week rsquo;s rest and the player could now miss the first two games in the five-match one-day series in Lahore on October 18 and 20.
 ldquo;He has been advised to not bowl for a week by the doctors but he can train, rdquo; Pakistan manager Talat Ali said. ldquo;It depends on his progress and how quickly the injury heals. rdquo; 
	Butt penalised
 
	 Lahore: Pakistan vice-captain Salman Butt has been fined 50 percent of his match fee for making comments about the umpiring decisions during the second Test against South Africa.
 Match Referee Alan Hurst charged Butt with public criticism and inappropriate comment on a match related incident or match official.
 The penalties prescribed for the offence also included a one Test or two one-day matches ban but Hurst let off Butt with a fine and reprimand after he apologised for his remarks at a hearing held after the day rsquo;s proceedings on Thursday. Cronje movie 
	Johannesburg: Five years after his death in a plane crash, a new biopic on former South African skipper Hansie Cronje that has begun filming will likely re-ignite the debate over the man, who was once revered as a national hero but later became synonymous with the murky world of match-fixing.
 The match against Australia at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg, with Cronje look alike Francois Rautenbach playing the role of the late Proteas skipper, will be featured in the opening scene of the movie, before it all went wrong. SA race row 
	Durban: South African cricket team touring Pakistan has become embroiled in a race row after the chairman of selectors apparently claimed that only half the side for the one-day series has been chosen on merit.
 The South African selection committee chairman, Joubert Strydom, is reported to have made the remark after Cricket SA president, Norman Arendse, had rejected the original 14-man squad because it was not of the ldquo;right mix rdquo;.
 According to a newspaper report from Lahore, ldquo;players of colour rdquo; had asked Cricket SA to look into the matter.

 Superb Kaka takes Milan to top of world

Yokohama: Kaka led Italys AC Milan to a 4-2 victory over Argentinas Boca Juniors in the World Club Cup final on Sunday. 
The Brazilian set up two goals for Filippo Inzaghi and scored a wonderful solo effort to give the European champions a record fourth club world title. 
Im really satisfied, said Kaka, who is favourite to win the Fifa World Player of the Year award. This was the only trophy I wanted that was missing and I cant put my feelings into words. Ive managed to win all the trophies that I thought would be difficult to win. 
Milan avenged their penalty shootout defeat to Boca in the 2003 Toyota Cup, the forerunner to the Club World Cup. 
Milan played the last 13 minutes with 10 men after Georgia defender Kakha Kaladze was sent off for a harsh tackle on Leandro Gracian. 
Milan previously won the club world title in 1969, 1989 and 1990. The Serie A giants picked up $5 million prize money for the victory and became the first European team to win the revamped competition.

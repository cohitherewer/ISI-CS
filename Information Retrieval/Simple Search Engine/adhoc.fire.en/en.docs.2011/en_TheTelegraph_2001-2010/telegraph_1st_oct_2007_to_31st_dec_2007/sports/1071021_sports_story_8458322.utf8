 Iran eves impress despite 1-3 loss
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTGurgaon: It was the beginning of a new era for womens football in Iran, at the Devi Lal Sports Complex, here on Saturday. Pitted against India in the Asian championships qualifier, Iranian girls played their first full-fledged international match in 15 years. Despite going down 1-3, the Iranians displayed glimpses of their skill. No wonder Katayoun Khosrowyar, one of the Iranian players, promised to give India a much tougher fight when the two teams meet again in Tehran on October 27. For us this is only the beginning, she said. The scoreline is not a true reflection of our standard. We have returned to big league after a while. All I can say is that the future is bright. We will offer India a good fight back home. In fact, Iran took India by surprise when they took the lead through Fereshteh Karimal in the eighth minute, a slamming shot that brooked no answer from India captain and goalkeeper Ronibala Devi. India, however, did not take much time to hit back and struck twice before the half time. Bembem Devi was the first to score, an angular shot from the top of the box in the 14th. In the 28th minute, Bala Devi put India ahead when she headed in a flag kick by Sasmita Malik. A good number of local fans who thronged the stadium, heartily cheered the home team when Lalvarmoi Hmars solo effort resulted in the third goal.

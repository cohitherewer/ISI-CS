 Sudha rewrites national record 
OUR CORRESPONDENT Y. Bala Devi after winning the womens 20 km walk on Thursday. A Telegraph picture Jamshedpur: Sudha Singh of Railways set a national record in womens 3000m steeplechase on the penultimate day of the 47th National Open Athletics Championship at the JRD Tata Sports Complex Thursday. Eclipsing the N. Shanthis mark (10:44.65 seconds) created in Bangalore (July 2005), the 21-year-old clocked 10:18.76 en route to the gold medal. A ticket collector with the Central Railways in Mumbai, Sudha was surprised by her performance as she was hoping to finish within a timing of 10:35. I had plans to improve upon my earlier performance of 10:52 clocked in the recently concluded Inter-Railways meet in Bhubaneshwar, but an effort like this I had never thought of, Sudha, who hails from Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, said. Teammates Kiran Tiwari (10:50.12) and Kamlesh Bhagal (11:03.90) bagged the silver and bronze respectively. Services Om Prakash claimed the mens 3000m steeplechase gold (8:48.06). Arun DSouza of Railways finished second (8:49.24) while Elam Singh of Services (8:52.15) settled for the bronze medal. Y. Bala Devi earned Railways another gold in womens 20km walk.

Sharda Devi of Petroleum Sports Control Board (PSCB) picked the bronze medal. Manpreet Kaur of Railways had a throw of 13.62m to bag the womens shot put gold. The 17-year-old Patiala lass, who joined the Railways earlier this month, incidentally, bettered her Senior Federation Cup performance (14.49). Railways made a clean sweep in the womens pole vault with V.S. Surekha fetching the gold (3.75 m), Chetna Solanki the silver (3.60m) and R. Jisha the bronze medal (3.40 m). The mens long jump saw Shiv Shankar Yadav of Railways claim the top slot with a 7.73m effort. Punjabs Shamsher Pratap Singh picked the silver (7.42m) while PSCBs Rajiv Kumar settled for the bronze medal. Delhis Harpreet secured gold in the mens discus throw with a hurl of 52.24m even as Bihar opened its account through Krishna Kumar Sharma, who managed 52.06m.

 Gonzalez stuns Federer
 Andy Roddick in action against Nikolay Davydenko at the ATP Masters Cup in Shanghai on Monday. (Reuters) Shanghai: World No. 1 Roger Federer lost consecutive matches for the first time in four and a half years, falling to No. 7 Fernando Gonzalez of Chile 6-4, 6-7 (1), 5-7 on Monday at the Masters Cup. It was the defending champions first loss in 11 meetings against Gonzalez, and snapped the Swiss stars perfect 15-0 record in round-robin play at the season-ending tournament that features the top eight mens singles players and doubles pairs. It was a tough loss, Federer said. I thought I played pretty good. I wish I had an excuse. Federer won three Grand Slam titles in 2007 and already has clinched the No. 1 ranking for the fourth straight year. But he has been vulnerable over the past month, falling twice to the No. 9 David Nalbandian, first in Madrid, then again in the third round at the Paris Masters. The last time Federer lost two matches in a row was in 2003 when he fell in the third round in Hamburg, then the first round at the French Open. Federer was never in trouble until the second-set tiebreaker when Gonzalez, who had only won two sets in their previous meetings, stunned him by running off to a 6-0 lead. Federer saved one set point before sending a forehand long to level the match. Shouting and pumping his fist, Gonzalez had break points for the first time in consecutive games in the third set but couldnt convert. Federer squandered five break points of his own. Federer looked stunned as Gonzalez whipped winner after winner, and the Chilean finally converted a break to pull ahead 6-5. Gonzalez showed some nerves by double-faulting while serving for the match at 40-0, but Federer sent a forehand wide to end it. Earlier, Roddick survived a second-set lapse to beat No. 4 Davydenko 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. Mixing up his powerful serve and forehand with forays to the net, Roddick fended off four break points in the first game, broke Davydenko once to take the first set and again to go up 4-3 in the second. After appearing in complete control, the fifth-ranked Roddick then won only two points in the next three games as the Russian broke him twice to level the match. Roddick smashed his racket after missing a forehand wide on set point, then managed to pull himself together, running off five straight games to take a 5-1 lead in the third. Did it help to break the racket, which he gave to fans afterward? For as many times as its helped me, its hurt me that many times also, Roddick said. Its just part of my personality. Ive always been pretty expressive and emotional on the court. After Davydenko held, Roddick finished off the match by holding serve at love. He then had to wait to celebrate as Davydenko challenged whether the final shot on the line was good. It was. Davydenko said he started nervous, then tired in the third set. With one of the heaviest schedules of any player, he has said he plans to cut back next year because he feels his body is breaking down.  (AP)

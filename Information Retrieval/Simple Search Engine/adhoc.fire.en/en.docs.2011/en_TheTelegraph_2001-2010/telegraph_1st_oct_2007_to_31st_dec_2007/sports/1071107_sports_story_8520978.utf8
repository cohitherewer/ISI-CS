 Taxing time unfair on Lewis Hamilton 
Kevin GarsideThe halo-removers must be on overtime. Lewis Hamilton is another step removed from sainthood this morning after a further bout of Swiss-address outrage. The ethics committee is taking a hard line with the man over his rationale for deserting England for the company of mountainous merchant bankers. His insistence that it is not about tax got him into more difficulties on the occasion of his book launch in central London on Tuesday. Prima facie, it is a straight-forward business matter that cuts a little anonymity with the deal. Perfect for a multi-millionaire-to-be seeking a quiet life when it suits. Is that so offensive? The moral majority would have it as a betrayal. Hamilton is happy to court publicity when it puts money in his pocket, then slam the door on the punters when the money is banked. That is the argument they hammer home with pious zeal. It does not matter to them that the portrayal of Hamilton as a ruthless cynic might not embrace his character in the round. The dogs have their bone and instinctively seek to bury it. Shame. Hamilton is a product of a Western liberal upbringing that holds the great god cash in high esteem. It is called capitalism. It is the system that underpins democracy in western culture. In this scheme, tax efficiency is a virtue. Hamilton is guilty of nothing other than good husbandry. He is 22, wealth beckons, so manage it. There are any number of legitimate ways and means via off-shore companies that would allow Hamilton to remain in the UK and pay less tax than the Swiss option. Nevertheless, Switzerland it is. Now, personal wealth is a sensitive issue. Talk of salaries between friends is not an after-dinner topic. One wonders how many in Hamiltons position would not do the same. There are some hefty sporting names in residence there. It comes back to Hamiltons reasons for leaving, an open goal for the righteous brothers. For the record, Hamilton said this about the Swiss issue: First of all I love my fans. I love making people happy. Its a great feeling to have someone come up to ask for a picture or an autograph. I like to spend as much time as I can with my fans. But Im at a point in my life where I have an opportunity to see the world. I dont see why I cant take that opportunity. The reaction has been a surprise. I dont expect anyone to pay any attention to what Im doing. In my heart my only home is where my parents live [Hertfordshire], where I grew up. It is where I love being but you cant live at home all your life. Attention switched to his prospective team-mate next year, and to Fernando Alonso. Now that the Spaniard is out of the McLaren house, Hamilton can see his good side. Im a true competitor. I like to do things fairly. I never get to the end of the season and say at least someone else [Alonso] did not win it. Thats not my style. I wish Fernando all the best and look forward to racing him next year. He is one of the best I have driven against. McLaren are in no hurry to fill the gap. Alonso holds the key to the market. As soon as he makes up his mind, the outstanding line-ups will submit to the domino principle and fall neatly into line.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

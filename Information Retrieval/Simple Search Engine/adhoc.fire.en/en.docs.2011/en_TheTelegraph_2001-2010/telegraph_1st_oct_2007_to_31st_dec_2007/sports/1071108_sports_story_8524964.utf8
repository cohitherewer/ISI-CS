 Bengal let Hyderabad off the hook, tie drawn
A STAFF REPORTER Murtaza Lodhgar, who took five wickets in Hyderabads second innings, is congratulated by Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Manoj Tiwary and Ranadeb Bose after their Ranji Trophy group B Super League match at Eden Gardens on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: It was an anticlimax for Laxmi Ratan Shukla in his first match as Bengal captain. Even a double century, a debut century and a five-wicket haul by his teammates fell short as Hyderabad registered a morale victory of sorts drawing after following-on  at the Eden on Wednesday. With a victory (courtesy first innings lead) in their first Ranji Trophy Group B Super League match, Bengal got three points and the visitors got one, as per the new rules. For a team who scored 461 in the first innings and then restricted Hyderabad to 227, and then chipped off three top order batsmen in the visitors second essay, the remaining seven proved too difficult. Hyderabad went on to score 302 for six as the final day ended after two mandatory overs. If the credit  from Hyderabads perspective  goes to Anoop Pai who scored an unbeaten century in his third Ranji match, the Bengal bowlers failed miserably to exploit home conditions. With strike bowlers Ranadeb Bose and Shib Shankar Paul drawing a blank, Shukla tried all possible options. He even changed his style of bowling from mediumpace to off-break, brought on part-time off-spinner Anustup Majumdar and leggie Manoj Tiwary, but Bengal failed to get last four Hyderabad wickets. Sourashish Lahiri proved to be a disappointment, having conceded 100 runs with just one wicket (Amol Shinde) off his 31 overs. Murtaza Lodhgar was the most impressive. In his comeback match, he bagged six wickets (one for 13 and five for 68). If Bengal bowlers failed to dismiss the visitors twice, part of the blame has to go to the slow nature of the pitch. Chief selector Arup Bhattacharya did not mince any words while blaming the slow pitch. We failed to exploit the home conditions We lost out on six points (five point for an outright win and a bonus point). There was hardly any help from the wicket, Bhattacharya said. The captain echoed Bhattacharyas sentiments: It was very disappointing The wicket was not as quick as expected. Resuming at the overnight score of five, Pai was perseverance personified as he selected his shots carefully. He cut out all the risky shots and scored just 52 off boundaries  most through his favourite pedal sweeps. Batting partner Arjun Yadav was at his supportive best as the duo (for the fourth wicket) stitched 73 runs in the pre-lunch session. Debutant Habeeb Ahmed became Lodhgars fifth victim when Wriddhiman Saha did the needful behind the stumps. But then, M.P. Arjun refused to move as he tested Bengal bowlers patience for about one and half and hours (79 balls) before both the captains agreed for a draw. VVS Laxman may have evaded the reporters till the third day, but the Hyderabad skipper was first to oblige post match on Wednesday. It gives a lot of confidence ahead of the season The boys showed lot of character.

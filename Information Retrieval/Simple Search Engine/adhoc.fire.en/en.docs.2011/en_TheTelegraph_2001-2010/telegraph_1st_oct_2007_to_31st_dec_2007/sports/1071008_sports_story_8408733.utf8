 India firm on returning Aussie fire
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTChandigarh: The on-field verbal dual that has somewhat marred the spirit of the ongoing India-Australia one-day series, is likely to continue here if the opposition does so, Robin Uthappa said on Sunday. The Karnataka batsman, who addressed the customary pre-match news conference instead of captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, said the Indian team was not going to be bogged down by the aggressive nature of the Australian cricketers. We are going to give it back, said Uthappa sharply when asked about the sledging by the visitors. We are going to hit back at them. You must have seen how we are talking back on the field. I am also doing so. There is not going to be any let up on this issue. Uthappa said the Indian team had no intention of lying a bit low in the last one-dayer in Hyderabad. We were a bit mellowed because of too much media hype. We know where to draw the line. When asked what he felt about the way Ricky Ponting and his boys behaved on the field, the Indian batsman laughed and said: We are learning fast from them. It wont be long before we catch up with them. The relationship between the two teams has been sore from the beginning of the series and it reached the lowest ebb in Kochi. The Match Referee had to call both the captains and tell them to show restrain. Unlike Uthappa, Australia captain Ricky Ponting tried to play down things and said Indians were yet to understand the meaning of aggression. Aggressive cricket is not all about body language, staring at the opponents and exchanging a few words, said Ponting. To me it is playing cricket the hard way. Thats what we do. Ponting said India and Australia have been playing quite regularly but never had any problem before. Perhaps some young boys in the Indian team are a little more enthusiastic. Antics apart, there were suggestions that Aussies had proved better than India in cricketing abilities. Uthappa didnt agree. They have certainly adapted themselves well to the conditions here, he said. Man to man we are still a better side. The Twenty20 cricket, according to Uthappa, has proved to be little disadvantageous for the Indian team. It took us some time to come out of the momentum. We didnt get much time to prepare against a team like Australia. But now we are ready for the battle. Matthew Hayden is yet another riddle the Indians are yet to solve. Uthappa said the bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad has been working with the bowlers to curb the Aussie opener. Both our bowling and batting should be much better on Monday, he asserted.

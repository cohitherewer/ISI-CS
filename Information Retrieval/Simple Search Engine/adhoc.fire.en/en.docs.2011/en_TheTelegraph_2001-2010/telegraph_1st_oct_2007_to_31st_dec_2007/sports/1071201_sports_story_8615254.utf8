 Joy for Helsingborg, Panathinaikos

(AP) London: Swedens Helsingborg and Greek side Panathinaikos became the first clubs to reach the knockout phase of the Uefa Cup on Thursday. Former European champions Bayern Munich missed their chance to reach the last 32, a 1-1 draw in Portugal against Braga ensuring the Bundesliga leaders still have work to do to qualify from the group stage. Bayern led through Miroslav Kloses early second-half goal, the Germany striker converting Luca Tonis cross, but were pegged back by Austrian striker Roland Linz in a physical encounter. Bayern have five points from three games in group F, followed by Aris Salonika on four and Bolton Wanderers on three. Braga have two points while Red Star Belgrade, bottom without a point, are not out yet. Tottenham Hotspur manager Juande Ramos waved his magic Uefa Cup wand again as Spurs produced an electric second-half showing to hit back from two goals down to defeat Denmarks AaB Aalborg 3-2 at White Hart Lane. Panathinaikos, with two wins from two, were not in action on Thursday but Atletico Madrids 2-0 home win over Aberdeen guaranteed the Greeks qualification from group B. In group C, Mlada Boleslav of Czech Republic beat Swedish side Elfsborg 3-1. Ivo Taborsky, Alexandre Mendy and Petr Vorisek scored for the winners. (Reuters)

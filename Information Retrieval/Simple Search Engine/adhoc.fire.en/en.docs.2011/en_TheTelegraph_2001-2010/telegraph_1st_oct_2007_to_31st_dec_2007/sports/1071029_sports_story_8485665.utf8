 Karthik century helps India Blue to title

(PTI) Ahmedabad: A brilliant unbeaten hundred by wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik helped India Blue lift the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy with a six-wicket victory over India Red at the Sardar Patel Stadium at Motera on Sunday. Chasing 270 for victory, India Blue reached the target in just 41 overs for the loss of four wickets. Coming to the crease with his side precariously placed at 55 for three in the ninth over, Karthiks innings had aggression written all over it as he spanked the first ball he faced for four. He went on to forge a 47-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Suresh Raina. After Raina (50 in 45 balls with nine fours) departed at the team total of 102 for four, Karthik (116 not out in 92 balls) took the mantle and clubbed together an unbeaten 168-run partnership with Neeraj Patel. Both batsmen scored over six runs per over and saw their team cross the 200 mark in the 33rd over. Karthik, who was dropped on his individual score of 42, reached his 100 in 83 balls spanking 11 fours and two sixes. Karthiks innings was a timely reminder to the selectors after he was dropped from the squad for the first two ODIs versus Pakistan. Patel scored an unbeaten 62 off 70 balls. Earlier, Gautam Gambhir hit a sparkling half-century (83) and shared a 111-run partnership with Subramaniam Badrinath to help India Red set a challenging target. Thanks to Gambhirs knock, they were ultimately all out for 269 in 49.3 overs after electing to bat. Gambhir held one end intact after India Red suffered early setbacks by losing opener Praveen Kumar (1), Karan Goel (4) and captain Mohammed Kaif (22) early. The Delhi left-hander played some gutsy shots striking seven fours and a six during his 77-ball stay at the crease. He, along with Badrinath (55) repaired the innings and took the score past the 150-run mark. India Blue spinners then caused a mini-collapse as Amit Mishra removed Gambhir and bowled Virat Kohli for a duck. Virender Sehwag then scalped Paresh Patel in the very next over. However, Badrinath and wicketkepeer Mahesh Rawat (43 not out) ensured that their team reached a fighting total. Mishra was the most successful bowler for India Blue as he claimed three wickets for 45 runs. It has been a good tournament for Mishra after being in the wilderness for sometime. Joginder Sharma and Yo Mahesh claimed two wickets each.  (PTI)

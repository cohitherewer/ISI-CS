 Buchanan plan to stop Sachin
Melbourne: Former coach John Buchanan has handed Australia a blueprint to stop Sachin Tendulkar in the forthcoming series, saying the Indian batsman is susceptible to short-pitched bowling early in his innings. Operation Get Tendulkar will be the key plank of Australias plan for the four-Test series this summer and Buchanans video analysis of the Indian provides crucial intelligence. He has noticed Tendulkars footwork has become sluggish, especially early in his innings, making him vulnerable to quicker and shorter bowling followed by the sucker punch of a fuller delivery. What Ive been seeing for a while is that his feet dont move early in his innings and he is not very fluid early on, Buchanan said. That makes the good-pace short ball a great weapon. Its something that Australia should be very conscious of this summer. The short ball should be followed by a full one for a favourable result, he said. It doesnt necessarily mean you will get Sachin out with the shorter ball. But you can push him back on his crease and then look for a full ball, which he can tend to squirt to the slips early in his innings when he doesnt have great control, Buchanan said. However, Buchanan feels Tendulkar is not playing with the same consistency.  (PTI)

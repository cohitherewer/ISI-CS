 Gilchrist wants the landmark ball back
Hobart: Adam Gilchrist has appealed to the Australian public to help him find the ball he smashed his 100th Test six with. The Australian became the first player to crack 100 Test sixes when he belted Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan over the fence during the second Test on Saturday. The only problem was that Gilchrist hit the ball so far that it sailed outside the ground and into a nearby street and was lost. The umpires were forced to use a replacement ball for the rest of the Australian innings but Gilchrist later appealed to anyone who may have found the ball to return it to him. Im not a massive collector of memorabilia but I think theres probably a few little bits and pieces every cricketer has stashed away that means something to them Thats a unique little item and Id love to get it back, Gilchrist said. Gilchrist went into the match with 97 over-boundaries to his name but took his career tally to exactly 100 during his unbeaten 67 that allowed Australia to declare on 542 for five and chase victory.

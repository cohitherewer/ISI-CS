 AI hold Mahindra, Churchill win 3-0 
Mumbai: Mahindra United came back from a goal down to hold city rivals Air India to a 1-1 draw in their opening encounter of the ONGC I-League at the Cooperage on Sunday. South African Bashiru Abbas scored for the Airmen while Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu netted for the Mahindras helping the two outfits split points. Mahindra took time to settle down and fell behind to a 33rd-minute goal by Abbas. Mahindras slowly came into their own after the change of ends. Their perseverence and midfield domination eventually proved fruitful in the 73rd minute when experienced campaigner Yakubu netted in a cross of Douhou Pierre from the left to restore parity. Mahindras could have finished with all three points but Pierres measured pass to substitute Sushil Kumar was foiled in the nick of time by Air India custodian E.C Sharad. In Margao, Durand Cup champions Churchill Brothers started their campaign on a bright note beating Sporting Clube de Goa 3-0 at the Nehru Stadium on Sunday. Churchill, who led 1-0 at half time, scored through Odafe Onyenka Okolie (31st), Mboy Iyomi (65th) and Reisangmi Vashum (90th).  (PTI)

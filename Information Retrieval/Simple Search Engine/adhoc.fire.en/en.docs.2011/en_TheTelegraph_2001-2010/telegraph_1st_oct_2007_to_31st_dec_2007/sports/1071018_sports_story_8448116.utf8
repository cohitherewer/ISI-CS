 AC Milan appeal Dida ban
 Dida Milan: AC Milan appealed to Uefa on Wednesday to reduce a two-match ban for goalkeeper Dida in the Champions League. Dida was suspended for pretending to be injured after being touched by a Celtic fan who ran onto the field during a 1-2 loss in Glasgow two weeks ago. The incident occurred when a Celtic fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute and made what appeared to be minimal contact with Dida. The Milan goalkeeper then turned to chase the fan before dropping to the ground. He was carried off the field on a stretcher with an ice pack pressed to his cheek, and was replaced. Celtic were fined 30,000 Swiss francs (US$25,400) for the incident and will have to pay an additional US$25 if they fail to control their fans again in the next two years. The 27-year-old fan who invaded the field was later arrested and banned for life by Celtic. (AP)

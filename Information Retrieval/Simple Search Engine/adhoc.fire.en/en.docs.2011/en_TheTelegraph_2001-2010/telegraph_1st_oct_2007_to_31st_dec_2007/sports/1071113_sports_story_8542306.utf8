 Flintoff should captain again, says Fletcher

Fletcher, who revealed that Flintoff once turned up sloshed for a practice session during the Ashes in his autobiography, said the flamboyant cricketer deserves another shot at leading the English team despite his drinking problems in the past. I dont think there is any reason why it should be held against him. There are a lot of factors at picking a captain.

Fletcher said Flintoff still has a long way to go before mastering the nuances of captaincy but has the potential to be a great leader. He needs some experience.

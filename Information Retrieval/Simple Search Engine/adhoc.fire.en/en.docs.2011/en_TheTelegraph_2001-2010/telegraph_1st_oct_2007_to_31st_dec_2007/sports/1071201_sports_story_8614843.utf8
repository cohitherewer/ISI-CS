 Wright bats for Yuvraj
 Yuvraj Singh arrives in Siliguri on Friday to play for Punjab against Bengal. (PTI) Melbourne: John Wright feels India will have to play Yuvraj Singh in place of a senior batsman to have any chance of toppling Australia Down Under in the four-Test series beginning on Boxing Day. I hope Yuvraj gets a good look-in as he plays well on hard and fast wickets. If you are aiming at succession planning, you have to get him involved as soon as you can, the former India coach was quoted as saying in an Australian newspaper. Yuvraj was Man of the Series in the recent ODIs against Pakistan, but has not found a berth in the Test XI. Wright said it was not fair to keep the talented left-hander out of the Test fold. There are some for whom age is not on their side and their last performance counts. They are under some pressure, said Wright. Yuvraj isnt in the Test XI, but he was the player of the one-day series against Pakistan. Its time he gets involved in Tests too, the former New Zealand opener added. The newly appointed High-Performance manager of the New Zealand team felt that apart from bringing in Yuvraj, India will have to be at their aggressive best to rattle the Aussies in their backyard. If the openers can get through the first hour like Aakash Chopra and Virender Sehwag did on the last tour, that will allow the middle-order batsmen to play well, he said. Wright also gave thumbs up to Anil Kumbles appointment as the Test captain and said the veteran leg-spinner would be crucial to the visitors chances Down Under.  (PTI)

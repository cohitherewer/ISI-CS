 Australia in command 
A STAFF REPORTER  Michael Clarke (top) and Mike Hussey, who scored unbeaten 145 and 133, respectively Calcutta: Mike Hussey and Michael Clarke scored fine hundreds before Brett Lee claimed a couple of early wickets to put Australia in the drivers seat on the second day of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Brisbane on Friday, according to www.cricinfo.com. Hussey made 133 and Clarke remained unbeaten on 145, helping Ricky Ponting finally declare at 551 for 4. In reply Sri Lanka received two quick jolts from Lee before gratefully accepting an offer of bad light, finishing the day at 31 for 2. Marvan Atapattu (19) and Mahela Jayawardene (5) were the unbeaten batsmen. Clarke and Hussey put on a 245-run fourth-wicket partnership to nip Sri Lankas ambitions in the bud, sending their bowlers on a leather-hunt right from the beginning. Sri Lanka struggled more to find a breakthrough with off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan failing to pick up a single wicket on Day II. After Husseys dismissal, Clarke and Andrew Symonds switched back into a limited-overs mentality as they added a quick 75 from 12 overs after tea while the declaration approached. Symonds was responsible for most of that late boost as he raised a brisk 53 not out from 61 balls. Clarke continued to play a sensible and relatively risk-free innings. He took 187 deliveries to register his fifth century and he watched the ball tirelessly, using his feet effectively to Muralidharan as he often came forward to play handsome drives.

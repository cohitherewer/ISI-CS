 Bhutia too hot for EB

A STAFF REPORTER 
 N. Mohanraj congratulates Bhaichung Bhutia after the latter scored the winner at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture 
Calcutta: The peerless Bhaichung Bhutia provided a lifeline to Mohun Bagans beleaguered campaign, guiding his team to a 1-0 win against East Bengal in their ONGC I-League clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 
The India and Mohun Bagan captains moment of brilliance came in the 62nd minute, when he turned a cross from Jose Ramirez Barreto into the winner with a perfect header. 
The seasons third successive win over Subrata Bhattacharyas side at the Salt Lake Stadium helped Mohun Bagan climb up provisionally to share the joint fifth place with Mahindra United, having fetched 11 points from eight matches. East Bengal, following their fourth defeat in a row in the countrys premier club competition, were lying in the danger zone with just seven points. Their title hopes are now as good as over. 
If Bhaichungs predatory instinct was the high water mark of Mohun Bagans display, East Bengals performance, or lack of it, was best captured by Mehrajuddin Wadaos bizarre tackle on teammate Soumik Dey in the 23rd minute. 
The midfielder from Kashmir, much to the surprise of all and sundry, lunged on the East Bengal left-back as the latter tried to clear the ball. In the process, Soumik was injured and needed medical attention while Mehrajuddin was booked by referee K. Sankar for his incredulous act of violence. 
Outthought, outwitted and outclassed  East Bengal were as dull as Mehrajuddins brain. 
For nearly an hour, the game had just meandered along, like a river at low tide, slow and murky. As many as six players  three from each side  received caution from the referee inside the first 25 minutes as the two sides threw their weight about, winning possession for anything but good football. 
Missing M. Suresh in defence and Alvito DCunha in midfield, Bhattacharya had lined up in 4-4-1-1 formation; hoping Anupam Sarkar to provide balance to the backline, Ashim Biswas to operate in the hole, and Mehrajuddin to race back as much to close down the Bhaichung-Barreto combine as looking forward to assist the upfront man Edmilson. 
The players hardly linked up and with Mehrajuddin making a mockery of his assignment, East Bengals submission to Mohun Bagans formidable midfield looked a foregone conclusion. 
East Bengal still took heart from such moments of promise as Ashims quick attempt from a melee and Edmilsons intelligent chip, which was negotiated by Mohun Bagan keeper Shilton Paul, but Carlos Roberto Pereiras team was always dangerous on the break with the countrys most deadly attacking duo. 
The Brazilian coach unleashed P.C. Lalawmpuia 10 minutes after the breather and the strikers pace and potency down the flanks added more sting to Mohun Bagans attack. And the goal came soon after. 
The ball reached Man of the Match Douglas da Silva following his teams first corner and he sent it to the far end where Barreto was lurking. The Brazilian headed the ball back into the box as goalkeeper Subrata Paul came out of his line to challenge him and up went Bhaichung  unmarked and in a flash  to ruin East Bengals chances once and for all in the match. So disarrayed was the East Bengal defence at that time that the only player next to the scorer was his own defender, Habibur Rahman. 
All the red-and-gold shirts, Anupam, Majek Bolaji and Surkumar Singh remained rooted in their respective places, perhaps bemused by the thrilling confirmation of the class that is Bhaichung. 
East Bengal went on the offence thereafter, but without conviction. Edmilson missed a sitter, his attempted shot going awry. With that, their run in the I-League may have taken a wrong route as well.

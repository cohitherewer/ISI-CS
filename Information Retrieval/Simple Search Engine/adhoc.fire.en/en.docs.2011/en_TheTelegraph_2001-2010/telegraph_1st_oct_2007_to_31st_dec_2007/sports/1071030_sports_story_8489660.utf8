 Car for Dhoni, but no land for stadium!
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI File picture of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the Toyota Corolla presented by Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda in Ranchi last week Calcutta: Just days after presenting a premium car to the states pride, Indias ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Madhu Koda-headed Jharkhand government opposed a Heavy Engineering Corporation (HEC) move to lease 30 acres to the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA). Its bewildering, but this has been the season of ironies. For example, one-time staunch opponents of the World Twenty20, India, won the inaugural edition. That was last month. Then, the other day, former captain Rahul Dravid (considered an oldie at 34) got replaced by Virender Sehwag. At 29, hes no youngster. The JSCA intends using the land, not far from Ranchi airport, to build its own stadium. So far, Tata Steels Keenan in Jamshedpur has been hosting international matches allotted to the JSCA. The state government opposed the lease before the Jharkhand High Court in Ranchi on Monday morning. A short while later, however, it sought permission to file a counter affidavit and Justice R.K. Merathia gave time till November 20. The next hearing is on November 23. For technical reasons, the HEC needs the courts permission as it has (through a writ) challenged a Board for Industrial amp; Financial Reconstruction ruling in 2004 pertaining to its existence. The JSCA, which is headed by the IG (CID), Amitabh Choudhary, was compelled to seek the HECs help as the state government sat on its request for land. Earlier this year, 30 acres got identified near an agricultural university, but the process didnt move forward after end-June. Too much of red tape, perhaps. The chief minister was first approached 11 months ago, soon after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) gave its affiliates a three-year deadline to raise stadiums of their own. The affiliates are assured of grants from the parent body and the JSCA has asked for whatever can be sanctioned by the BCCI. Incidentally, some months ago, the Tamil Nadu government handed over 50 acres to the state association even though it already has the showpiece M.A.Chidambaram Stadium (Chepauk) on a 99-year lease. Choudhary wasnt available for comment, but one of his colleagues in the JSCA told The Telegraph: Were confident that the lease will eventually come through and, on Tuesday, the five consultants shortlisted for the stadium are to make presentations The BCCIs deadline has to be met. The JSCAs managing committee is also expected to meet on Tuesday. Choudhary, once seen as being very close to one-time BCCI supremo Jagmohan Dalmiya, has been facing innumerable hurdles and had to beat the-then home minister (Sudesh Mahto) in order to retain his position in the last elections  summer of 2006. Elections in the JSCA are held biennially.

 Hyderabad face defeat as Laxman flops again
 - RANJI TROPHY 
 -  Bengal inflict follow-on; Lodhgar bags three A STAFF REPORTER Bengal spinners Murtaza Lodhgar and Sourashish Lahiri at the Eden on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Bengal coach Bharat Arun neatly summed up the Day III proceedings against Hyderabad in a nutshell. An ordinary start but a strong comeback, was the former NCA coachs view of the days turn of events in their Ranji Trophy Super League Group B match at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. Analyse this: In reply to Bengals first innings score of 461, Hyderabads top five  including VVS Laxman and Arjun Yadav  scored only 56 runs. The bottom half, however, stitched 171 as Hyderabad, resuming at 65 for five, ended up with 227. Asked to follow-on, Hyderabad struggled as comeback man Murtaza Lodhgar emerged the hero of the day (post-tea session). The visitors were mesmerised by Lodhgars tweakers as they ended the day on 86 for three. Among his three dismissals, the prize catch, obviously, was that of VVS Laxman. Its really a Very Very Special dismissal, Lodhgar said after the match. After being ignored for the last two seasons, for Lodhgar it really was a special day. If Shib Sagar Singh hadnt joined the ICL, the veteran left-arm spinner would have struggled for a berth. But he did not disappoint the selectors who picked the bulky spinner ahead of a more agile Iresh Saxena. Experience was the factor, chief selector Arup Bhattacharya had said. And it indeed was Lodhgars experience which deceived Laxman. The king of Eden, having been dismissed for a duck in the first innings, looked to do a 281 as he played some clean backfoot drives but Lodhgars short mid-wicket (Sourashish Lahiri) strategy undid the senior pro. Laxman could only make 18. It was a great satisfaction to see him struggling against my bowling Youve got to be lucky to get wickets. Obviously I was under a lot of pressure I did the basics like hitting the deck, varying the pace Didnt want to do anything extra And as it turned out, my strategy clicked, a smiling Lodhgar said. Soon after the skipper departed, play had to be stopped (thanks to bad light) with a deficit of nine overs. For Hyderabad, Ravi Teja did the bulk of scoring in their second innings. Blazing his blade at every delivery, Teja hit two sixes and five boundaries en route to his 47. His opening partner, Daniel Manohar, managed 7. Daniels dismissal saw Shib Shankar Paul bruise his right little finger while taking a catch. There were no injury worries for Paul though. Keeping in mind the slow nature of the track, Laxmi Ratan Shukla employed the spinners very early in Hyderabads second innings. First to come was off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri, the top sniper during Hyderabads first essay. But as it turned out, Lodhgar, from a different end  High Court  did the magic. Credit also should not be taken away from three-match old Amol Shinde. The Hyderabadi off-spinner, resuming the day on 7, tried to do a Wriddhiman Saha for Hyderabad First came his 40-run stint with debutant wicketkeeper Habeeb Ahmed. But the highlight was the eighth wicket partnership (74) with left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha, which gave some respect to the total. Shinde went on to score 90  his best effort in Ranji. Not surprisingly, Shinde said it was the most memorable knock of his career so far. The wicket was slow and difficult to bat I could have played on said Shinde.

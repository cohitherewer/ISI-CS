 Ekalavya Award too little too late: Advani
Bangalore: In a show of unity, some of the leading sportspersons of Karnataka on Sunday rallied around world billiards champion Pankaj Advani who declined to accept the Ekalavya Award conferred by the state government stating it was a too little too late. Justifying his decision not to attend the award ceremony Saturday, where 82 other sportspersons received awards, a miffed advani told reporters: Had I been given the award eight years ago, I would have been happy, but now it is a case of too little too late. Swimming champions Nisha Millet and Shikha Tandon and former hockey player Ashish Ballal, who came out in Advanis support, agreed that due recognition had not been given to the cue sports stalwart who had not only won the world title but had won several other prestigious awards in his career. The Ekalavya Award was late in coming, they opined while speaking for the 22-year-old cueist. Nisha said Pankaj was now past a shawl and a sandalwood award honour. A befitting honour for him now would be the Karnataka Ratna award, the highest civilian award of the state, a cash award and a citation, Ballal said. Protesting the discrimination meted out to other sportspersons after the state government announced awards for cricketers like Robin Uthappa, a member of the victorious ICC World Twenty20 team, Advani asked: Why this discrimination? Why double standards? The state government, he said, should come up with a clear guideline on the specific amount of money to be awarded to the various title holders. Stressing that the lacking of recognition for him was not an isolated incident, Advani said: It applies to other achievers as well. Why do we have to fight for our rights, he asked. Sania Mirza was presented awards by the state government and Rahul Dravid was bestowed with honours very early in his career, pointed out members of the Karnataka State Billiards Association. The association had highlighted Advanis achievements time and again, but there had been no response, they said. The speakers clarified they were not against cricketers being awarded but were against the discrimination suffered by sportspersons from other fields. While cricket was played by a handful of countries, some of the other sports were played at a much larger scale at the global level, Nisha observed, while urging corporates to look beyond cricket.

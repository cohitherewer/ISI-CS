 JCT to face Salgaocar 
 Malsawmtluanga scored a brace in Salgaocars 4-1 win New Delhi: Brazilian Eduardo Da Silva Escobar netted four times in JCTs 5-0 rout of Assam Rifles in Osians Durand Cup football tournament at the Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday. Escobar started his goalscoring spree after Nigerian Julius Irabor Akpele found the target in the 15th minute adding his own strikes in the 34th, 53rd, 66th and 89th minutes. JCT now face Salgaocar in the quarter finals on November 4. In an early match, the Goan riding on a Malsawmtluanga brace thrashed Viva Kerala 4-1. Salgaocar were clearly the superior outfit as they found the net through Shylo Malsawmtlunga (15th and 90th minutes), Nigerian Felix Chimaokwu (38th) and Nicholas Rodrigues (40th) to book a spot in the last eight. Saikhom Santa Singh (73rd) was the lone scorer for Viva Kerala. Though they started brightly Salgaocar grew aggressive and had the bulk of the possession due to their dominating midfield. Skipper Rocus Lamare freed Anil Kumar on the left wing and a cut back to centre found Jerose Oliviera, who passed to Malswmtlunga on the right edge of the box. The latter had time to chest it down before firing into the net. Salgaocar, doubled their lead when two Viva medios got in each others way allowing Malsawmtlunga to run on the left flank with the ball before passing to Felix inside the box to tuck it home. They were soon three up from a free-kick from outside the area. Kelemba Singh brought down Remus Gomes at the right edge of the box and the resultant dead ball opportunity was brilliantly curled in with a left-foot shot by Nicholas Rodrigues. In the 53rd minute, Malswmtlunga played a square ball to Anil Kumar whose shot beat the Viva keeper but was cleared off the line. The goal acted as a tonic for Viva Kerala and they launched attacks with renewed vigour but they had clearly left themselves a lot to do in too little a time. At the other end, Salgaocar put the finishing touches on a good days work when Felix centred for Malswmtlunga, who found the net in the dying minutes of the game.  (PTI)

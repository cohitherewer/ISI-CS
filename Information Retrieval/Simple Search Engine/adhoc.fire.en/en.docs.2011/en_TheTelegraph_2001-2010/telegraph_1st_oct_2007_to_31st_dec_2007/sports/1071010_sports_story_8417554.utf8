 Sania loses singles, up in doubles
New Delhi: Sania Mirza crashed out of the first round of the Kremlin Cup, going down 6-3, 6-4 to Argentine Gisela Dulko in Moscow on Tuesday. The 29th ranked Indian went out of the $ 2,340,000 Tier I tournament in an hour and 15 minutes. Sania was coming off a quarter final appearance at the Japan Open but could not continue her good form in the Russian capital. Service was again the bugbear for the Hyderabad girl as she sent down as many as nine double faults. She won only 48 per cent of points on her first serve and 26 per cent on her second while committing 40 unforced errors in comparison to her opponents 31. Her return game was good as she broke the 41-ranked Dulko five times but returned the favour on seven occasions. The Argentine made a hattrick of wins over the Indian star after getting the better of her at the 2005 French Open and the Tier III event at Pattaya City this year. Later, Sania and Patty Schnyder of Switzerland beat Vera Dushevina of Russia and Tatiana Perebiyinis of Ukraine 6-1, 6-3 to advance to the doubles second round.  (PTI)

 Shoaib Malik against Inzy return
 Shoaib Malik Karachi: Experienced Pakistan duo Inzamam-ul Haq and Mohammed Yousuf are set to return to the side for the second Test against South Africa from Monday in Lahore. Sources close to the national selection committee said on Thursday that both Inzamam and Yousuf had made themselves available for the Lahore Test. Yousuf is already training with the team while Inzamam will join them by tomorrow, said the source. However, even as PCB chief Dr Nasim Ashraf is scheduled to meet Inzamam to discuss his future, captain Shoaib Malik reportedly does not want him back in the team which may become a crucial factor in deciding the former captains fate. The selectors are facing a dilemma as they feel Inzamam, with an experience of 119 Test matches, should prolong his career for the coming tour of India and the home series against Australia. They want Inzamam to put his retirement plans on the back-burner for now but Malik is reluctant to have his former captain back as he thinks that he could have a negative influence in the dressing room. Inzamam will meet the PCB chairman and selectors to take a decision on his future, a PCB source said. The original plan was that Inzamam would announce his retirement before the second Test against South Africa, but now the selectors are having second thoughts, he said. The growing feeling is that it would be beneficial for the team if Inzamam tours India and plays against Australia before retiring. The source added: Malik is apprehensive that Inzamam being such a senior player, he may lose control over the players if he is back. (Agencies)

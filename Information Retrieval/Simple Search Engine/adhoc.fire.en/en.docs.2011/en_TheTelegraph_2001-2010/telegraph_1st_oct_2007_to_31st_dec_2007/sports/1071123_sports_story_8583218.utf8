 ENGLAND dream dashed
HENRY WINTER  Down and out: England goalkeeper Scott Carson lies on the pitch after Englands 2-3 defeat to Croatia at the Wembley on Wednesday. England needed at least a draw to advance. (AP) Outclassed, outfought and outthought, England are out of Euro 2008. Russia qualify behind the outstanding Croatians and England have only themselves, and their hapless manager, to blame. No one will mourn Steve McClarens departure. Forget the 25 million people losing their identities in the post; a whole nation lost its identity at a drenched Wembley. The enduring symbol of a night of a thousand tears was of McClaren standing helpless in the dug-out, shielding himself from the rain with an umbrella, knowing that nothing would protect him from the downpour of rancour that descended on him at the end, the fall of the final curtain. Hopes lifted by Israels stirring weekend victory over Russia, England shamefully squandered their second chance. Only a point was required, only some composure under pressure, only a decent first touch. All proved beyond England, and no wonder the fans spat venom at McClaren and his players. The horrors, the horrors. When Scott Carson endured one of those nightmare handling moments that haunt keepers, gifting Niko Kranjcar a goal, the blood of England supporters began to boil. If anyone can become famous in 15 minutes, England flirted with infamy amid defensive scenes more Edvard Munch than Andy Warhol. The scream emanating from Englands fans stopped briefly in a second half that twisted the emotions this way and that. Austria and Switzerland came back into view when Frank Lampards penalty and then a fine Peter Crouch strike gave England parity. They just needed to survive the final 13 minutes but then came Mladen Petrics thunderbolt, condemning England to a humiliating summer on the beach next year. After this disaster, the nations pulse will remain dangerously high for months, the FA will be calling crisis meetings to find a new manager, while the debate will intensify over the importance of developing good young players, those with a technique under pressure to rival the Croatians. The need to nurture the grass roots of the game will also extend to Wembleys pitch which looks like the Horse of the Year Show has returned with a heavy-footed vengeance. Tens of thousands of supporters traipsed everywhere from Zagreb to Moscow, Tallinn to Skopje and Barcelona to acquire the ticket stubs giving them the right to buy Euro 2008 match tickets. For what? Nothing. And now the ticket to ride has been lost. England woke up only after the interval with the arrival of David Beckham and Jermain Defoe. Until then, Croatia enjoyed the freedom of Wembleys scarred surface. After the pre-match monsoon, lightning struck twice. First came the moment that will disturb Carsons sleep for years. Darijo Srna, the Shakhtar Donetsk attacker, raced down the right, catching out the woeful Wayne Bridge before sliding the ball across to Kranjcar, the Portsmouth winger, whose right-footed shot flew goalwards. Carson seemed to have the ball covered, but it bounced directly in front of him. Like an apprentice wicket-keeper, Carson bent down to collect the ball which clipped a glove and carried on into the net. The Croatians celebrated as if they had just earned a free trolley-dash at Harrods, and their delight soon doubled.Carson was not culpable this time when Croatia came calling again on the counter. The accomplished holding midfielder, Niko Kovac, began the move, hooking the ball out. Now Croatias determination and athleticism was observed, Eduardo jumping powerfully to head the ball to Olic. The return ball received, Eduardo then toyed with the white shirts, confusing Sol Campbell and Joleon Lescott, who seemed hypnotised by the Arsenal strikers movement. Eduardo simply teased the ball past Campbell and Lescott towards the penalty spot. Shaun Wright-Phillips stood with his arm in the air, like an anxious fifth-former wanting to be excused. Olic, patently onside, took full advantage, running through, rounding poor Carson and sliding the ball into the back of the net. News then filtered through that Russia had taken the lead and group E stood for Everest. England had a mountain to climb, their stars totally eclipsed. McClaren had to act, and sent what he hoped would be the cavalry at half-time in the form of Beckham and Defoe. Hope sprang up. When Josip Siminuc tugged back Defoe, Lampard coolly placed the spot-kick past Stipe Pletikosa. Belief spread through the fans yet Croatia still threatened: Bridge almost conceded an own goal while Carson saved brilliantly from Olic twice. Nerves fraying, supporters looked to Beckham for salvation. Struggling for fitness, the LA Galaxy midfielder can still deliver a superb cross, and with 25 minutes left Beckham certainly delivered. The ball was swept in perfectly from the right, Crouch chested down and then drilled an equaliser past Pletikosa. Then disaster. Danijel Pranjic cut in from the left, setting up Petric, whose shot flew past Carson. Englands dream had turned into a nightmare.Next England manager: The contenders Steve McClaren rsquo;s failure to guide England to the European Championships has cost him his job and left England looking for a replacement to raise the national team from one of its lowest points in recent history. But who will be the latest manager to accept the poisoned chalice of ldquo;the second most important job in the country rdquo;?JOSE MOURINHO
 Mourinho is everything that Steve McClaren is not. A habitual winner of trophies during his brief but entertaining career as a manager, notably with FC Porto and latterly Chelsea, Mourinho would bring a culture of success to the job that McClaren was unable to do.
 Odds: 7/2
 MARTIN O rsquo;NEILL
 O rsquo;Neill is the most credible British option having made a name for himself with Leicester City, Celtic and more recently showing signs of reviving Aston Villa rsquo;s fortunes. He had said: ldquo;It is one of the great jobs in football. Had it been offered then I would have been absolutely foolish to turn it down. rdquo;
 Odds: 7/2
 GUUS HIDDINK
 The Dutch coach rsquo;s stock is high amongst an English public that has grown accustomed to foreign managers getting the better of domestic ones both at home and on the international stage. He has also done what McClaren failed to do and taken an average side (Russia) through qualification to Euro 2008.
 Odds: 16/1
 SAM ALLARDYCE
 Probably the best option if England was to be managed by another Englishman, Allardyce lost out to McClaren 15 months ago and expressed his displeasure at being overlooked. Plain speaking and enthusiastic, the Newcastle manager would bring an injection of blood and thunder to a side on their knees.
 Odds: 16/1
 FABIO CAPELLO
 The Italian has already expressed an interest in the position and is currently unattached to a club and so securing his services would be less fraught for an FA stung by the botched attempts to woo Luis Felipe Scolari last time around.
 Odds: 8/1
 LUIS FELIPE SCOLARI
 Scolari was scared off by British media intrusion the last time England came calling but despite that chastening experience the Portuguese did not rule out the possibility of taking over England at some point in the future. Currently in charge of Portugal, the Brazilian rsquo;s contract is due to end at the same time as their participation in the Euro 2008 finals. 
 Odds: 8/1  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

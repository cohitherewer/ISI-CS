 Boards havent done enough to create Ashes aura, says Kapil 
 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
 - The former captain, whose ICL gets under way today, reflects on Indo-Pak cricket LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHICalcutta: World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev, whose Indian Cricket League (ICL) takes off on Friday, needs no introduction. The other day, he took time off to speak to The Telegraph at some length about India-Pakistan face-offs. Kapils own debut was versus Pakistan, 29 years ago. The following are excerpts Q Having made your debut against Pakistan, what are your emotions when an India versus Pakistan contest is on? A One is more involved because the man on the street is more involved... Its with good reason that many see an Indo-Pak series as being bigger than the Ashes. Do you also see it that way? (Grins) In this part of the world, its bigger than anything. If its not treated so elsewhere, its because the Boards havent done a good job of projecting an Indo-Pak series. Theres so much of history which needs to be put forward in the right manner. If you want my view, and Im not saying this because Im with the ICL, you need former cricketers to be involved... Nobody will understand history and tradition better than them. Why? Because theyve been part of it. Sadly, in the subcontinent, its not the cricket heroes but others whore given greater weightage. Its so sad, for example, that (Gundappa) Viswanath lost the elections in Karnataka. Have you sensed a change in mood? Generally, yes, the atmosphere has changed... For example, Id never imagined crowds in Pakistan would cheer the Indian cricketers, but that happened on the 2003-04 tour... Couldnt imagine that (Laxmipathy) Balaji would become such a big hit with the crowds there. Yet, that too happened on the same tour... I also couldnt imagine that Pakistanis would have the Tricolour painted on one cheek... Today, the relationship between teams is also better... Theres no hostility, the kind seen during my time. Theres intense competition, yes, but nothing uncivil. Some 24 hours after landing in India, captain Shoaib Malik visited Virender Sehwag to offer his condolences on the passing away of the senior pros father... (Interrupting) Malik made a lovely gesture and the media did the right thing by highlighting that visit. To go back to your debut, do you recall your thoughts on the morning of October 16, 1978 What I do remember is that I didnt sleep the previous night... Id been told by the manager (late Fatehsinh Rao Gaekwad) that Id be making my debut and the excitement and tension got the better of me... Im not sure about now but, in those days, it was a tradition for somebody about to make his debut to say something at the pre-match team meeting... Cant exactly recall what I said, but I remember speaking in a mix of Hindi and Punjabi. Having had a sleepless night, wasnt focusing a problem? Nahin... The excitement took care of everything... It was the realisation of a dream... What did you tell yourself when you reached the top of your mark for the first time in Test cricket? I had to bowl to Majid Khan, somebody Id grown to admire for his performances in the West Indies a couple of seasons earlier (an awesome 530 runs in five Tests)... I became conscious that Id be bowling to a great opener... Whats your message for players who debut against Pakistan? A debut is a debut but, yes, theres definitely more pressure when its versus Pakistan... My advice is simple: Back yourself and dont allow the occasion to get the better of you... Rather, get the excitement to lift your performance. Whats the one stand-out memory from that first tour? The way Pakistan chased 160-plus in under 25 overs in the Karachi Test... Then, my getting runs as the nightwatchman in Lahore... Pehle tour ki memories kabhi jati nahin hain. Didnt Javed Miandad or Sarfraz Nawaz try to needle you? Sarfraz did, in the Karachi Test... I paid him back in his own coin... Thats the first time I retaliated... Sarfraz and the rest probably didnt expect a rookie to respond in their language... In fact, when I let go a series of bouncers in that Test, Pakistan skipper Mushtaq Mohammed told my captain (Bishan Singh Bedi) that hed finally got a man in his team. I was on cloud nine when Bishan relayed that to me... Praise from the opposition is, after all, so much more sweeter. The one Indo-Pak Test which you havent forgotten At the Chepauk in early 1999... Sachin Tendulkar played one of the greatest knocks (136 in the second innings), but we lost narrowly (by 12 runs)... Both teams were on their toes right through the match... Also, the one at the Kotla, some weeks later, when Anil Kumble got all ten wickets in the second innings... I suppose the one in Karachi too, on my debut tour, which was won by Pakistan... The Pakistani batsmen treated the Test like a one-dayer... Any ODI? The 1986 Austral-Asia Cup final when Miandad hit Chetan Sharma for a last-ball six... Then the previous years Rothmans Cup in Sharjah, where we defended 125, bowling out Pakistan for 87. Also, winning the Benson amp; Hedges World Championship of Cricket, defeating Pakistan by eight wickets in the final at the MCG. The final one: Who is the one Pakistan cricketer youve admired more than the others? Pakistan has produced a number of stalwarts... Imran Khan and Miandad, Waqar Younis and Inzamam-ul Haq but, for me, nobody has been bigger than Wasim Akram... An absolute great.Eden Dossier India have won 8 and lost 8 of their 34 Test matches at the Eden so far with the rest (18) ending in draws.

 15 months for Alex attacker
London: A man who punched Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson in the groin outside a London station last month has been jailed for 15 months. The 43-year-old Kevin Reynolds from Scotland, who was described as a homeless fighting drunk in court, had pleaded guilty to assault and to attacking and racially abusing a police support officer who was called to the scene. Ferguson was waiting to be picked up outside the Euston station in central London after travelling from Manchester to attend an annual charity event when the attack happened on September 10. He had soreness and tenderness after being punched, but was not seriously injured. Reynolds had been released from a prison sentence for assaulting a police officer just five days before the attack on Ferguson. (AP)

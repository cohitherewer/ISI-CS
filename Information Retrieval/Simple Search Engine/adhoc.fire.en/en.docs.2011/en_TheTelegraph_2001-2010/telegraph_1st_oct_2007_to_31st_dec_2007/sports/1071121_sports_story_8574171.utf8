 I dont have to bother about anything except getting runs
- A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL- Yuvraj Singh, MoS in the ODIs versus Pak, opens upLOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI			Yuvraj SinghNew Delhi: Team Indias ODI (and Twenty20) vice-captain, Yuvraj Singh, has struck a purple patch. He may, of course, still not make the XI when the Test series begins here on Thursday. MoS in the ODIs against Pakistan, Yuvraj spoke to The Telegraph at the Le Meredien on Tuesday evening. The following are excerpts On having bagged his fourth MoS award, on Sunday, this time 19 months after his last (at home, versus England) Ive been batting well for the last six months or so (starting with the ODIs in Ireland) However, Id only got one big score against Australia in the series before Pakistan and, so, was determined to score big in every alternate match at least Im happy I could get fifties four times out of five. On whether the award has enhanced his claims for a berth in the Test XI Well My job is to get runs If the team management feels I fit into the XI, then Im going to be there Its not for me to tell people that I should be in the team I dont have to bother about anything except getting runs. On his most satisfying innings of the series The 77 in Kanpur, where the wicket was low and slow. In the past, Id been criticised for not doing well on such surfaces On being disciplined for the first time by a Match Referee (Roshan Mahanama in Jaipur) Till that evening, Id never shown dissent in seven-plus years of international cricket It happened in the heat of the moment and I apologised to the umpire (Suresh Shastri, whod actually erred) I reacted that way (indicating the ball had gone off his shoulder) because we were then in a critical phase of our chase We lost, but I could have On what drives form Quite a few factors Hard work most definitely and theres the element of luck too Youve got to work hard and your game has to be disciplined. On the areas where he could improve Im looking to finish games more consistently The more one plays, the better one becomes. On being looked upon purely as an excellent one-day batsman Thats because Ive largely played ODIs in the seven years of my career If I get to play Tests in the next seven, then Im sure Ill be looked upon differently. Whats happening is part of my journey. On his last Test having been 16 months ago Yeah It was in the West Indies (Kingston) The reality is that Ive just played 19 Tests. On whether his motivation suffers, particularly on tours, when hes regularly out of the Test XI Its difficult and can get frustrating, but what to do? It was especially tough on the summer tour of England Ive always had to make maximum use of the opportunities. On the superb understanding between him and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Usually, one needs to call well That, they say, is crucial to any pair succeeding. Where Dhoni and I are concerned, we dont need to call The eye contact suffices. (After a pause) Fact is we enjoy each others batting and enjoy batting together If Im bogged down, Dhoni hits a four Similarly, if hes under pressure, I get a boundary If theres an off-spinner bowling, then Dhoni goes after him If theres a left-arm spinner, then Im going to go after him. We dont allow the momentum to suffer. Plus, his presence gives me confidence and my being at the other end gives him confidence. On having allowed Dhoni to hit the winning runs in Gwalior (Laughs) Dhoni likes to hit them, likes to end the match with a six Hed asked me to get my fifty and, then, leave the series-winning runs for him. As it turned out, I got my fifty (53 not out) and he got the runs which gave us the six-wicket win and the series. On whether his 6x6 World Twenty20 feat has made it tougher for him Crowds do expect me to keep hitting sixes, thats something Ive got to live with. But Ive got to judge what the situation demands and play accordingly. On whether, nowadays, theres less tension in Indo-Pak face-offs Theres no drop in intensity and the tension isnt less. The one change today is that the teams concentrate on good cricket instead of abusing each other Its because weve been playing so often, the hype is probably less. The pressure isnt, though. Finally, on Indias newest Test captain, Anil Kumble Kumble has always been regarded as one of our best He has always been respected and will continue to be respected. Kumble, I feel, is perhaps the most intelligent in our team.

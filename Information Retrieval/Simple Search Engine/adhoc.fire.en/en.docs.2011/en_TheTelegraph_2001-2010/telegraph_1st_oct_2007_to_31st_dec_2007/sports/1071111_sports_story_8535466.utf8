 Gunners in racism soup
London: Three season ticket holders at English Premier League side Arsenal claim the club could be in breach of contract for allegedly allowing racist chanting at their stadium, a report said on Saturday. A British newspaper said the trio  a Christian, a Muslim and a Jew  had written to the club chairman, claiming that the use of the words yid and yiddos to refer to fans of Tottenham Hotspur broke human rights laws. Some Arsenal fans argue that the terms directed towards their north London rivals are not racist and refer to their Jewish history, claiming that even some Spurs fans call themselves The Yid Army.

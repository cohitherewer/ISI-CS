 Shoaib: Pick Tait to scare India 

 - Fast bowler advises Aussies to prepare green tops 
 SHOAIB AKHTAR: PAPER TIGER? 
Melbourne: Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar has urged the Australians to select Shaun Tait for the upcoming Test series against India as he reckons the slinger would be a scary proposition for Anil Kumble amp; Co. on the green tops. 
The Australians must pick Shaun Tait  The Indians will be scared of him. Theyre not comfortable with pace at all, Shoaib was quoted as saying in a local newspaper on Sunday. 
Tait, whose action was questioned by the visiting New Zealand team in the ongoing Chappell-Hadlee series, could make the cut for the series against India if the selectors opt for an all-pace attack. 
Shoaib felt the hosts will need to prepare quick and bouncy tracks to shake up the formidable Indian batting line-up. If the Aussies make nice quick pitches, they (the Indians) will be jumping all over the place, he said. 
The Rawalpindi Express felt the game was loaded heavily in favour of the batsmen and called on the administrators to make it a more balanced affair. Cricket has become so boring. Too many rules. You cant bowl like the days of bodyline, he said. 
Tait, meanwhile, fears doubts that the legality of his action may haunt him for some time to come. Its the worst thing any bowler could face. I just hope something like this doesnt hang over me for the rest of my career like it has with Muralidharan. 
Tait found support from Shoaib though, whose own action has been questioned time and again. 
My advice is leave Tait alone. There is no way in the world Taits a chucker, Shoaib said.

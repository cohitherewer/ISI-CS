 The flip-side of scandal 
Sue Mott Martina Hingis An astonishing thing happened last week. Tennis was in the headlines. We did a double take, but there she was. Martina Hingis in November. And alongside her in the news, a male player who might have been a character in a Dostoyevsky novel for all we had ever heard of him, Nikolay Davydenko. Neither had won anything. Far from it. The Russian has become infamous for losing, not winning. Already under investigation in conjunction with match-fixing allegations, which he denies, he was trying to account for his complete loss of ability at the overarm serve  quite a staple in modern tennis  which resulted in his early defeat in St Petersburg. His explanation was that he couldnt give one. He is, by the way, ranked fourth in the world. Hingis was news because she had tested positive for cocaine at Wimbledon. Vast tracts of airtime and acres of print were devoted to a young woman who is normally riding her horses or swishing about on the court in anonymity at this time of year. The tennis administrators who have to deal with the fallout will not be pleased, and she denies taking cocaine, but our awareness of a sport that usually swims back into view come June has been suddenly and violently enhanced. Take cricket. Take rugby and football. Arsenal played Manchester United on Saturday. A billion people watched, a draw was achieved, a linesman demonstrated eyesight and Sir Alex Ferguson lost his temper. This once would have required wall-to-wall coverage with only Paula Radcliffes admirable win in New York and Joe Calzaghes continued demolition of all-comers. But now books, of all things, are commanding space. Cricket should be as dormant as a squirrel by now. It is not. A book written by Duncan Fletcher, the former England coach, is continuing to stretch the season into a kind of emotional play-off between cricketers accused of drinking too much and a coach accused of revealing too much. Some sports, you feel, cottoned on to this phenomenon years ago. Mentioning no names, Formula One. Someone, somewhere, once understood that keeping a sport in the news did not solely involve performance on the track but an abundance of controversies off it. This year F1 excelled itself. The emergence of Lewis Hamilton has been spectacular. The racing was close and, not for the first time, came down excitingly to the wire. But in conjunction with revs we had revelations: that McLaren were found guilty of possessing secrets from Ferrari, that Fernando Alonso was seething, apparently with jealousy at the arrival of rookie Hamilton, that tyres were too hot, too cold, too hard, too soft. Et cetera. Bemused onlookers were aghast that the sports governing body should allow such controversies to rage in the open.But some may take a different view. The sport may actually treasure its moments in the limelight, for good, bad, but never indifferent reasons, not least for the treasure that flows from publicity.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

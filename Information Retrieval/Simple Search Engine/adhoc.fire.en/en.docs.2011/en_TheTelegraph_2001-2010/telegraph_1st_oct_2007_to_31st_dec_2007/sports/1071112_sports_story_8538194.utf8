 Vandort, rain thwart Aussies
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Australias new look attack got their first real match in Michael Vandort, who almost single-handedly thwarted the hosts before he became Stuart MacGills 200th Test victim, according to www.cricinfo.com. Australia had set out to wrap up the first Test within four days but Vandort (82), regular rain breaks and bad light denied them a free Monday in Brisbane. When the umpires offered Sri Lanka the light, the visitors had reached 218 for five with Chamara Silva on 5 and Prasanna Jayawardene yet to score. Australia were still well on the way to victory  weather permitting  as Sri Lanka trail by 122 runs in their follow-on. Vandort patiently batted throughout the day and through four rain delays. Shortly after the final break, his 170-ball stay ended with MacGill ripping a super leg-break out of a slightly rough patch back into Vandorts off stump. MacGill was in his 19th consecutive over when he finally had that first stroke of luck. The classic MacGill leg-spinner was an appropriate way for him to collect his 200th wicket, achieving the feat in his 41st Test  only Clarrie Grimmett, Dennis Lillee and Waqar Younis took fewer games to get there. Vandort had been a major frustration for Australia but his dismissal gave the hosts back the momentum they had been lacking. The next over Thilan Samaraweera, who had spent nearly an hour and a half at the crease compiling 20, cut Mitchell Johnson viciously to gully where Michael Hussey took a sharp catch on the second grab.

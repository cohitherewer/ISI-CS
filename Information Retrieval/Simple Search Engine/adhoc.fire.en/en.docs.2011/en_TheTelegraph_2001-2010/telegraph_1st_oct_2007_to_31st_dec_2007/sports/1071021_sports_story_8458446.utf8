 Gambhir hopes to carry on
OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai: Mahendra Singh Dhoni said the Indian team had proved with their seven-wicket thrashing of Australia that the Twenty20 World Cup victory in South Africa was no fluke. The win means a lot. We wanted to prove that the World Cup victory was not a fluke, said the India captain, who hit the winning runs to seal the victory at the Brabourne Stadium on Saturday. Propelled by Gautam Gamhirs 52-ball 63, India reached the target of 166 comfortably. Dhoni praised Gambhir for his spectacular batting which included six fours and one six. Gautan played excellently. The way he batted was amazing. He was out of the team because of injury and made a good comeback. I hope he bats the same way in the Pakistan series, he said. We fielded well, we batted well, and we bowled in the right areas. We wanted to enjoy the game, Dhoni added. Man of the Match Gambhir said he would like his Twenty20s form to continue in the forthcoming ODIs. I think it (Twenty20) is working for me. I am playing well and I want to continue (with this form) in ODIs. Australian skipper Ricky Ponting said: We fell short by 15 runs. We gave too many extras... 23 extras means four extra overs. We did that the other night too (at the Wankhede). Ponting praised spinners Harbhajan Singh (17 in 4 overs) and Murali Kartik (27 in 4 overs) for containing the batsmen in the middle overs. Gambhir batted well (during the chase), he said. We would like play more matches against the new generation of (Indian) players, the visiting captain added. Despite the hostile reception given to Andrew Symonds, Ponting did not think the crowd was racist. The Brabourne Stadium crowd booed each time the ball went to Symonds during the Indian innings, and shouted Symonds go back when he was batting.

 Ian Bishop tips for Tanveer
A STAFF REPORTER Ian Bishop with Sohail Tanveer at the Eden on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Pakistan had an unexpected guest during practice at the Eden on Thursday. Former West Indian fast bowler Ian Bishop, who is here on a TV assignment, helped out promising left-arm pacer Sohail Tanveer at nets. The positioning of the arm, the run-up, the grip and the follow through  every aspect was dealt with. The session lasted close to an hour. Both teams were practising when Bishop dropped in with some members of the TV crew to get a feel of the stadium in the afternoon. As he was walking past the Pakistanis, Tanveer came up to Bishop. No, no, no I cant go into details. I was around and so we were trying to figure out a few things. Nothing special about it It would have been the same for Sreesanth or anyone else Bishop told The Telegraph. The 22-year-old Rawalpindi pacer has been most impressive on this tour. He was bang on target in the ODI series and made a decent Test debut at the Kotla as well. The Indians have been finding it tough to adjust to the left-armers natural angle. Bishop wasnt aware that Shoaib Akhtar was in danger of missing the Test. Oh is it! he exclaimed. That will be a big blow. He felt the availability of Umar Gul should help the visitors a lot. Bishop felt the wicket may turn from Day III. The wicket is dry This is unlike the one at the Kotla It should break up from the end of the third day, the supremely fit Bishop signed off, before rolling his arm over with his mates.

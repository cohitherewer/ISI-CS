 Maharashtra pile up 308/5 vs Mumbai 
Mumbai: Maharashtra took advantage of some wayward Mumbai bowling, slipshod catching and a flat track to pile up 308 for five wickets on the first day of the Super League group A match. The batsmen to prosper most for Maharashtra, after the visitors were asked to bat by Mumbai captain Amol Muzumdar, were Yogesh Takawale (batting 83 with nine fours and a six) and pint-sized left-hander Vishal Bilhare (78 with 11 fours and a six).  Mumbai were let down by some unimpressive bowling by Ajit Agarkar and Ramesh Powar and sloppy close-in catching. SUMMARISED SCORES SUPER LEAGUE  In Chennai: Tamil Nadu 262/1 (M.

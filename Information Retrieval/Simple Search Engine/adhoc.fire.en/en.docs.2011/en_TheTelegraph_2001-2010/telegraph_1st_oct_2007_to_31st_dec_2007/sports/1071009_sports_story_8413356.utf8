 Badrinath replaces Gambhir
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES S. Badrinath Chandigarh: Opener Gautam Gambhir, injured during a practice session here on Sunday, has been replaced by Tamil Nadu batsman S. Badrinath, according to a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) press release. Delhi lad Gambhir slipped and sustained a right adductor (groin) muscle strain. He would be out of action for two weeks. An MRI has revealed no significant injury, but from initial findings and clinical presentation it appears that he will be unavailable for approximately two weeks, said the BCCI release on Monday. The selection committee decided to include Badrinath in place of Gambhir, it added. The 27-year-old Badrinath, who is yet to make his international debut, drew the selectors attention with a double century for India A in their recent series against South Africa A. The right-handed batsman is currently busy playing for Rest of India against Mumbai in the Irani Trophy. An over the moon Badrinath said the call-up for the fifth ODI against Australia was a dream come true. Playing for India has been a childhood dream for me and I am delighted that I am close to achieving that now, Badrinath said. The 27-year-old Tamil Nadu cricketer is currently playing for Rest of India against Mumbai in the Irani Trophy in Rajkot and will join the Indian squad for the fifth match in Vadodara on Tuesday. Australia lead the series 2-1. Badrinath has been the mainstay of his state teams batting for the last two seasons and also led the side. Hes also a good fielder. The right-hander has been on the verge of breaking into the national squad for some time and his name has cropped up at several selection meetings. In 56 List A games in his career, Badrinath has scored 1,616 runs at an average of 38.47 and a strike rate of 76.33. He has one century and 13 fifties in the 50-over format with a highest score of 120.

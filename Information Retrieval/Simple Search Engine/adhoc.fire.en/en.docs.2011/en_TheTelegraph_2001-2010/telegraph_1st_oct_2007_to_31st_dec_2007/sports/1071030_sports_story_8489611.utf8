 Taufel bored with sledging
 Simon Taufel Melbourne: Bored with sledging, top ICC Elite Panel umpire Simon Taufel feels the India-Australia series points towards a tough season ahead when the players would be keen to gain every possible advantage against their rivals. Voted crickets best international umpire for the past four years, Taufel said he might come across some volatile situations during the forthcoming India-Pakistan series. Yeah, look it is (fiery between India and Pakistan). Fortunately the players themselves handle it reasonably well, Taufel was quoted as saying in the Australian media. Theres a lot of media focus on it as we know, but I think coming out the back end of the Australia-India one-day series we have seen that we are in for a tough summer of cricket where there is a lot of competitive players out there who are really striving for whatever advantage they can get, he said. However, in the aftermath of Darrel Hairs suspension, Taufel did not feel the necessity to officiate differently in a match involving teams from the sub-continent. I think there are different things to expect and different ways of handling it. But by and large you try and treat every game exactly the same and you prepare for it exactly the same, he said. The Australian said he was bored with the repetitive language used by some players and would step in to prevent sledging turning into ugly scenes as it happened between Sreesanth and Andrew Symonds. I think once it broaches personal issues and once it sort of supercedes your moral boundaries of what language is tolerable, and also when it sort of gets a bit mundane and boring to the point of just going on all the time. I think most umpires will tend to let the players get what they want to say off their chest and, from our perspective, we would rather make it a player versus player issue rather than a player versus umpire issue, he said. Citing an example of monotonous sledging, Taufel said, I was in Pakistan recently with Andre Nel playing for South Africa against the Pakistanis. Andre unfortunately only had one line that he was dishing out to Shoaib Malik and the boys so it got a bit monotonous there. We just had a chat to Andre and said to (captain) Graeme Smith, Well, look hes only traipsing out one line, its getting a bit boring. About the possible crowd jeering against Muttiah Muralidharan and the Indian team during their tour of Australia, Taufel said: I think all umpires just have to treat it as simply as they can and just call it the way that they see it, try not to pre-judge too many of those types of issues and make sure that theyre fair to both sides.

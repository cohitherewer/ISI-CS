 Karun thrilled to share track with Schumi
Barcelona: Karun Chandhoks Formula One test debut was reason for a double delight for the rookie driver, who not only shared the track with the iconic Michael Schumacher but also got a pat on his back from the Red Bull team. The Chennai youngster got the opportunity to test alongside Red Bull driver David Coulthard during the three-day test session at the Catalunya circuit, where Schumacher test drove for Ferrari. I had an exciting time over these past two days and I am pleased that the team was satisfied with the technical feedback I provided them. For me, it has been a dream come true to be out on the track with the likes of Schumacher and Coulthard. David has been very open and approachable which was a great help, a beaming Chandhok said. Praising the Indian, Red Bull team principal Christian Honer said: Chandhok contributed significantly to our winter development programme. Our regular test driver was unavailable for this test session due to another commitment and Chandhok was an obvious choice to stand in for him, given the potential shown in GP2 this year. (Agencies)

 Injury toll catches up with Terry
Jeremy Wilson England captain John Terry will miss Saturdays Euro 2008 group E qualifier against Estonia and, more seriously, has emerged as a major doubt for the crunch match against Russia in Moscow next Wednesday. A scan on Thursday was enough to convince head coach Steve McClaren that Terry should not be risked against Estonia, though the swelling around his knee was such that it was not possible to make a definitive prognosis of the possible long-term damage. It is understood to be a cartilage problem, with the worst-case scenario involving surgery and weeks on the sidelines. The Football Association remain hopeful that the damage is not that serious. Terry felt the injury after training on Wednesday, although it is not clear whether he suffered the setback while on England duty or aggravated an existing problem. John Terry had a scan on his left knee and will not be fit for Saturdays game against Estonia, said McClaren. He will remain with the squad and his injury will be assessed on a daily basis with a view to Wednesdays match in Russia.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

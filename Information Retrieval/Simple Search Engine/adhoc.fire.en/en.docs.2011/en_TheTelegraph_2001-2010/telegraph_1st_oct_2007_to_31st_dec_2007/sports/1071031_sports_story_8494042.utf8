 Draw ends India Cup campaign
 India captain Bhaichung Bhutia beats a Lebanon player in an aerial challenge during their World Cup qualifier in Margao on Tuesday. (PTI) Margao: Indias World Cup qualifying campaign ended after two matches, with Lebanon making the next round with a 6-3 aggregate against Bhaichung Bhutia amp; Co. here on Tuesday. Bob Houghtons side, needing a 3-0 margin to advance, held Lebanon 2-2 in the return leg through Bhaichungs last-gasp equaliser at the Nehru Stadium. Sunil Chhetri gave India a 1-0 halftime lead but the hosts was reduced to 10 men after goalkeeper Subrata Paul was sent off in the 71st minute after conceding a penalty. That setback effectively ruined the hosts chances in the match. Substitute Mohammed Ghaddar, who was instrumental in Lebanons 4-1 win at home against India, was again their saviour when he scored both the goals within a span of 13 minutes in 75 and 88 minutes. India captain then salvaged some pride for his team in the dying stages to achieve the draw. The match was postponed in Chennai due to heavy rain on Sunday and switched to Margao. Both teams started cautiously as play was confined to the midfield mostly in the first half. India made the first move in the 23rd minute through Bhaichung who set Chhetri into the box. Chhetri dodged past a defender but shot straight into the hands of keeper Mehanna. Six minutes later, Chhetri finally gave India the lead. Steven Dias lobbed the ball into the box for the unmarked striker whose header hit the post before entering the net. India continued to hold edge in the second half and had a chance to increase the lead but N.P. Pradeep wasted the opportunity when he drove the ball straight into Mehannas hands from close off a Dias pass. Just when India, who needed two more goals to score to make the next rounds cut, upped the ante, they suffered the jolt in the 71st with when Paul brought down Ali Mohammed inside the box.  The referee, Salem Mohammad Mujghee of Jordan, promptly gave Indian keeper the marching orders and Lebanon a penalty. Defender Samir Naik had to make way for Sandip Nandy. Ghaddar found no difficulty in converting the resultant spot-kick. Ghaddar then put his team up in the 88th minute when he dodged pass a couple of Indian defenders before drawing Nandy out to place the ball into the net. Two minutes into injury times, Bhaichung rose to the occasion, meeting a Dias corner with a perfect header, which beat the rival keeper hands down.  (AGENCIES)

 Stopping Kallis the key: Malik
Lahore: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik believes stopping South Africas Jacques Kallis will be the key to winning the second Test and levelling the two-match series. Kallis was the main difference between the two teams in the first Test we lost in Karachi, Shoaib said on Sunday. Malik rejected suggestions Inzamams final performance could turn into a distraction for his side. His inclusion is not a distraction but a boost for us. He has upped the morale of the team and we are hoping he has a good match, the Pakistan captain said. Meanwhile, South African captain Graeme Smith felt his team had matured and improved its mindset and entire game plan for playing in the subcontinent. We have lost quite a few matches in the sub-continent. We lost here (Lahore) in 2003, said Smith. But our whole performance of playing in the sub-continent has changed. Our mindset has changed. We play spin better and score runs off spinners. South Africa won the first Test in Karachi by 160 runs. TEAMS South Africa (likely): Graeme Smith (captain), Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, Hashim Amla, Ashwell Prince, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher, Andre Nel, Makhaya Ntini, Dale Steyn, Paul Harris. Pakistan (likely): Shoaib Malik (captain), Salman Butt, Kamran Akmal (wicketkeeper), Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf, Inzamam-ul Haq, Misbah-ul Haq, Abdur Rehman, Umar Gul, Danish Kaneria, Mohammed Asif. Umpires: Mark Benson and Simon Taufel; TV: Nadeem Ghauri. Match Referee: Alan Hurst.  (AGENCIES)

 Lee relishes his new role
Sydney: Australia fast bowler Brett Lee is very much at ease with his new status as one of the old guard in the worlds best cricket team. The blond firebrand still hurls the ball down the pitch at great pace and celebrates his wickets flamboyantly but, at the age of 30, he recognises that his role in the team has changed. There is an added pressure and more responsibility of course but to be honest that is a good thing, Lee said. One of my jobs now is to help the younger bowlers and that is something I enjoy. Lee will open the bowling in the first Test against Sri Lanka starting next week and, following the retirement of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, will be by far the most experienced member of Ricky Pontings attack. Lee has played 59 Tests since making his debut in 1999, 50 more than his new ball partner Stuart Clark, while Mitchell Johnson and Shaun Tait, one of whom should get the chance to fill McGraths big boots, have played just two Tests between them. Clark bowls in much the same style as McGrath, concentrating on accuracy and subtle variations, Tait generates similar express pace to Lee and Johnson is a lively left-armer. Stuey is very similar to Glenn and thats good for me because it means I can just concentrate on doing my own thing, Lee said. Whether its Mitchell or Shaun doesnt really matter to me, they are both bowling well and bring something different to the attack. I will be there to offer advice if they want it. Lee missed this years World Cup with an ankle injury but says he is raring to go as Australia embark on a gruelling schedule of up to 20 Tests in 2008. Im feeling pretty good to be honest and while it was disappointing to miss the World Cup it probably did me a bit of good in the long run, Lee said. The schedule is not too bad, the Test series are mixed up with one-dayers. I have had a good break and to be honest I cant wait to get started again. Lee said it would be strange not having McGrath to share the new ball with but his former New South Wales teammate has no doubts that Australia will make light of his absence. (Reuters)

 Becks wants to play 2010 Cup 
London: Steve McClarens exit will trigger another overhaul within the England team, and David Beckham hopes it doesnt include him  again. The Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder, who made his 99th international appearance in Englands 2-3 loss to Croatia on Wednesday, wants to play at the 2010 World Cup, when he will be 35 years old. I said at the start of my career Ill always want to play for my country and Id never retire from playing for my country, Beckham said on Thursday. That could obviously be taken out of my hands but I want to reach my 100 caps. To get those 100 caps would be a dream come true for me. Initially discarded after the 2006 World Cup, the former captain came to McClarens rescue when Englands European Championship hopes began to fade. They were finally extinguished by Croatias triumph at Wembley Stadium, ending McClarens bleak 15-month reign and Beckhams dream of playing in a sixth major international tournament. Ill still be available, Beckham said. Hopefully Ill still be playing, and playing well enough to be in the England squad in 2010. But who knows? Everything can change, and I have seen that in the last 12 months. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder believes the Football Association will hire a foreign coach. There are not many English managers out there who havent got jobs already, Beckham said. There are also a lot of talented foreign managers. Beckham came off the bench Wednesday night and set up Peter Crouch to make it 2-2  a result which would have been enough to clinch a berth in the finals. But Croatias third goal changed everything. We are disappointing and hurting, he said. While Croatia topped group E, Russia qualified as the second team after leapfrogging England with a 1-0 victory in Andorra. Guus Hiddinks men joined Sweden, Turkey and Portugal as the last four qualifiers. Sweden booked their place with a 2-1 victory over Latvia in Stockholm, Turkey made sure with a 1-0 win over visitors Bosnia and a 0-0 draw was enough for Portugal at home to Finland. Russia claimed the narrow win thanks to a 39th-minute header from striker Dmitry Sychev but they made hard work of it, missing a penalty just before half-time and playing the closing minutes with 10 men after the sending off of striker Andrei Arshavin.

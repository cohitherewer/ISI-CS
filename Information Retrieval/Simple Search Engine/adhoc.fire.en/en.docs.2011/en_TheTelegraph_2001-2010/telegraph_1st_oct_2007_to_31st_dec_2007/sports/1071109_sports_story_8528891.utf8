 Injured Serena out of Madrid meet
Madrid: World number five Serena Williams has been forced to withdraw from the WTA Championships in Madrid because of a knee injury and her place will be taken by Wimbledon finalist Marion Bartoli. The 26-year-old American retired after losing the first set of her opening round-robin match against Russian Anna Chakvetadze on Wednesday following treatment to her left knee. Williams initially thought she may be able to continue playing in the tournament but after further medical tests she announced her withdrawal. It was really short visit and I felt really sad. It was really unfortunate, Williams said. First reserve Bartoli will step in to the tournament, taking on Williamss result and playing the remainder of her round-robin matches in the yellow group. The 23-year-old French woman will play her first match against world number one Justine Henin, who made the semi-finals with an easier-than-expected 6-2, 6-2 win over Serb Jelena Jankovic. In the red group, Serbias Ana Ivanovic, who edged Svetlana Kuznetsova on Tuesday, moved a step closer to the last four beating Slovak Daniela Hantuchova 6-2, 7-6. After rattling through the first set, the world number four was forced to battle it out in the second as both players broke twice to go into a gripping tiebreak. They traded match points and set points, before the pressure got to Hantuchova and she netted a forehand to lose 11-9 in the tiebreak after a two-hour, 12-minute contest. Hantuchovas second straight-sets defeat means the world number nine has no chance of making it to the last four. Henin, who beat Chakvetadze 6-1, 7-6 on Tuesday, took control early on against Jankovic, breaking the world number threes serve three times in an error-strewn first set from both players.  (REUTERS)

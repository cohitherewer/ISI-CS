 I wouldve played free for United: Beckham
PATRICK BARCLAYWalk through the reception area of the David Beckham Academy, an establishment as squeaky-clean yet stylish as the principals most ardent fan would expect, admire the colourful friezes of childrens letters and paintings and you arrive at a gallery of souvenirs. Framed England shirts from Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen, Real Madrid ones bearing the signatures of Zinedine Zidane , Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos and an Arsenal one from Thierry Henry gaze down on glass-encased pairs of boots arranged in chronological order. The first were worn by Beckham when he scored a career-boosting goal from the halfway line at Selhurst Park in 1996 and Manchester Uniteds opposition that day is a reminder that much has changed since. Wimbledon were to reach the Christmas of 1996 in third place in the Premier League  they finished eighth  and are now out of existence. But one thing has remained constant since the 21-year-old Beckham drifted the ball over a scrambling Neil Sullivan. He passionately wanted to play for Manchester United then  and would like nothing better than to play for them now. When I asked if he could still do a job for the club his father taught him to love, Beckham replied: I think I could, but its never going to happen because I have pledged my future to the Galaxy. The subject had arisen by Beckhams choice. He had invited me to the Academy on the morning after Englands removal from the European Championship by Croatia and he confirmed the project had been originally inspired by the Bobby Charlton Soccer Schools he attended in his youth. Charlton was his fathers hero, to the extent that, when David was born, Ted Beckham gave him Robert as a middle name. Charlton is also a man Beckham has always looked up to. Never more so than now, perhaps, for Sir Bobby Charlton has a century of England caps and Beckham 99, with the possibility that the next manager will decide, as did Steve McClaren, that the new era should begin without the old captain. Charlton has also been a Manchester United director throughout the management of Sir Alex Ferguson and thereby hangs the tale Beckham was anxious to explore. Ive just read Sir Bobbys autobiography, he said, and it was interesting to see what he wrote about me leaving United (for Real Madrid in 2003) because he talked about seeing the contract I was offered by United and the amount of money involved. Well, I didnt see any contract, let alone the excellent, generous offer he was talking about. But I cant wait to see Sir Bobby next so I can ask him about it. Would he have stayed if the club and Ferguson had tried as hard to keep him as Charltons book implied? I would have played for Man United, he declared, with an expression that verged on the scornful, for free. So his departure for Madrid was not of his volition? No. There were many things that went on. But Man United was the club I always wanted to start my career at and finish my career at. The suggestion that it might yet happen made him laugh and add wistfully: I dont think so. Why? Because now Im at the Galaxy with a five-year contract and I think the end of that will be the end for me.  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

 Special protection for Alonso in Brazil
Kevin Garside Fernando Alonso Irony was bouncing off the walls at McLaren last night when they learnt they would be under scrutiny from the Formula One equality police at the final race of the season in Brazil next week. Responding to appeals from the Spanish Motor Sport Federation concerned about the treatment of that delicate flower, double world champion Fernando Alonso by McLaren, Formula Ones ruling body, the FIA, have dispatched a special officer to Interlagos to protect the world champion from his employers. The effrontery of the Spanish is compounded by the FIA, who in responding as they have, imply there is a case to answer. And this to protect a driver who has spent the season carping because he has not had the same special treatment he alleges is being lavished on his teammate Lewis Hamilton. Alonso sees nothing wrong with preferential treatment in principal. It only offends when he is the one not receiving it. His beef at McLaren all season has been that he has not been treated like a double world champion, but a normal driver. As a rookie he could not have thought of Hamilton as anything other than a normal driver at the start of the season. We must assume, therefore, that in Alonsos scheme of things inequality is the base line, one that institutionally favours world champions over normal drivers. And the FIA is sending out a wet nurse to look after him. Hamilton is the one who needs protecting, but he would never ask. McLaren, whose modus operandi is predicated on equal treatment to their drivers, welcomed the move. If nothing else it will put a stop to the tiresome trail of sour grapes from Spain.

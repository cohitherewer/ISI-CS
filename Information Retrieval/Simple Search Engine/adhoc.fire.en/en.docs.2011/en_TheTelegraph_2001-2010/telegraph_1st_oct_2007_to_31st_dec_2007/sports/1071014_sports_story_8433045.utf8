 Randhawa jumps into joint lead with Nirat
 - INDIAN OPEN
 -  Jeev comes up with another uninspiring round OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Jyoti Randhawa in action during Day III of the Indian Open at the Delhi Golf Club on Saturday. (AFP) New Delhi: Indian golfs glamour boy Jyoti Randhawa hit an efficient five-under 67 on Saturday to jointly lead the table with Thailands Chapchai Nirat on 10-under 206 in the Indian Open at the Delhi Golf Club Course. On a day when Indias numero uno Jeev Milkha Singh dished out yet another disappointing display, Randhawa shrugged off his mediocre show to stay on course for his third title in the $500,000 meet. There was still some nip in the air when Randhawa started Day III on a triumphant note. He picked up a shot in the opening hole and birdied the sixth and the seventh. Watched by his wife and former film star Tina Singh and newborn son Zoravar, Randhawa, however, dropped a shot on the fourth and had another bogey on the ninth to finish at one under halfway through. Son of a retired Army general, Randhawa is known for being an excellent marksman. On Saturday, on back-nine, he started off with a birdie hattrick and picked up one more shot on the 14th and then parred the next four holes to round off his day. I think it was my day. Coming from Europe, I was little jetlagged but now Im more at home here, Randhawa said. I wanted to be within two-three shots off the lead before going into the final round on Sunday. Im very happy to be tied for the top slot and that gives you a good chance on the final day, Randhawa said. Asked what would be his plan, Randhawa said: It will remain the same. I have to maintain my focus, play shot by shot and forget about everything else. Randhawa is very much aware that he has an uphill task against Chapchai on Sunday. He is a fine striker and has a good swing. He is definitely a player to watch out for and can become one of the greats. Golf is a game that develops with age I think I now know how to win tournaments. I have learnt a lot in the past few years and I have learnt a lot from my mistakes, he said. Unlike Day II, Chaichai, the joint overnight leader, didnt really set the course on fire and stumbled to a 73. New Zealander Mark Brown fired the days best of 64, highlighted by a closing eagle on the 18th hole which left him one shot behind the leading duo. Chapchai, too, knows that it wont be easy for him on the last day with Randhawa enjoying crowd support. Its going to be very exciting. Ive played with him in the first two rounds but Sunday will be different. Lots of fans will be cheering for him. Hes also the defending champion Itll be fun, said Chapchai. Playing here for the first time in five years, Jeev had an ordinary day as he ended on one-under 71 to be placed at tied 38th with a three-day total of one-over 217. Somehow, it didnt work out, said the star golfer. Im trying but its just not happening. I need to trust my putting more, he said. A battling 70 left local hero Gaurav Ghei in fourth place on 209, while joint overnight leader Chang Tse-peng of Chinese Taipei slipped back with a 77 for a joint fifth place with compatriot Lu Wen-Teh (67) and Australian David Gleeson (76). Uttam Singh Mundy nailed a rare albatross on the par five 18th hole, sinking a monstrous 262-yard shot with a three wood en route to a 68. It was the third albatross of the season and only the 15th in the history of the Asian Tour.

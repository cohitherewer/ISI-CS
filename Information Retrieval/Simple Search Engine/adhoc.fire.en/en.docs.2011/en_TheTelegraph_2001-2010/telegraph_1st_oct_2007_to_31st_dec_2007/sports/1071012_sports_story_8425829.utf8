 Ricky lashes out at Sreesanth
Melbourne: Sreesanth is haunting Australia even when he is warming the bench and a furious Ricky Ponting has labelled fresh charges of sledging against the pacer during the Chandigarh one-dayer. Even though Sreesanth was not part of the playing eleven in Chandigarh, his alleged taunting from the boundary line has irked the Australians. Ponting claimed Sreesanth had passed remarks and taunted five batsmen as they stepped in and out of the dressing room and wondered how he escaped punishment from Match Referee for such acts of indiscipline. Sreesanth reportedly clapped his hands in Andrew Symonds face as the allrounder was leaving the field and said, Australia would lose. It was disappointing to see that happening the other day. He (Sreesanth) chirped me out to bat as well. I snapped my head back around, Ponting was quoted as saying in an Australian daily on Thursday. Ponting, meanwhile, has said he is sorry if he lacked compassion when seamer Jason Gillespie was axed from the side during the unsuccessful 2005 Ashes defence. Gillespie, nick named Dizzy, was dropped before the fourth Test at Trent Bridge and the speedster felt he deserved a better treatment from his skipper. (AGENCIES)

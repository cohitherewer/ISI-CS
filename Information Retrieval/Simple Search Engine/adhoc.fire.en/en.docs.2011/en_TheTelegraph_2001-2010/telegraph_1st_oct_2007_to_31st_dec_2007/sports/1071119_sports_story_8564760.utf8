 - Champions ride Lalawmpuia goal A STAFF REPORTER Lalawmpuia and Shilton Paul after Mohun Bagans win on Sunday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Mohun Bagan rode a goal from substitute P.C. Lalawmpuia to pip Mohammedan Sporting 1-0 in their last outing of the Sahara CFL Premier Division at the Salt Lake Stadium Sunday. An unmarked Lalawmpuia netted the winning goal in the 88th minute of the match, after grabbing in a Prem Kumar miss pass just outside the top box and tapped it in from the far corner. Champions Mohun Bagan thus remained unbeaten in the league with 36 points from 14 matches. Mohammedan Sporting finished fifth with 16. Kumaresh Bhawal, in his swansong match, played till 11th minute before he was replaced by Lalawmpuia. Mohammedan Sporting played aggressively while the title holders  sans Bhaichung Bhutia, Habibur Rehman Mondal, S. Venkatesh and N.S. Manju  were on defensive. Despite some lacklustre performance, Mohun Bagan had some chances early. In the 17th minute, Lalawmpuia failed to tap in on a Dharamjit Singh cross from the left. Mohammedan Sporting had the upper hand but they failed to convert their share of chances. While two Adebayo free-kicks missed the target by a whisker, a James Singh right-footer in the 24th minute went wayward. Four minutes later, Douglas da Silva headed out a brilliant K. Kulothungan right-footer from a Seby Martins free-kick. Lalawmpuia squandered a chance in the 35th minute.

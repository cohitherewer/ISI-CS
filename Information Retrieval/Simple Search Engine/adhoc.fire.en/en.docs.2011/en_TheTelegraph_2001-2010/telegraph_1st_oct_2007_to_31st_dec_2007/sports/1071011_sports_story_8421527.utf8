(AFP) Lahore: Graeme Smith shared an undefeated 88-run partnership with Jacques Kallis to lead South Africa into a dominant position against Pakistan at the close on the Day III of the second Test at Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday. The tourists skipper, who made the 19th half century of his career, batted patiently to score 75 from 164 balls with 11 fours in a second innings total of 154 for two giving South Africa a lead of 305 runs in the match. The visitors bowled out Pakistan for 206 runs one over after lunch for a first innings advantage of 151 after fast bowler Makhaya Ntini took three wickets in an over before the interval. Pakistans former captain, Inzamam-ul Haq playing in his final Test added just four runs to his overnight total of 10 before being caught behind off Kallis after Pakistan resumed on a precarious 140 for four. Ntini finished with 3 for 42 while left arm spinner Paul Harris took 3 for 57. We are very confident about this Test, said Harris. We have got runs on the board. Its a very up and down pitch. Its turning more and chasing is not going to be easy feat. There was more bad news for the home side when pacer Mohammed Asif retired with an elbow injury after bowling just four overs. The final session belonged to South Africa with Kallis (37) continuing his golden form in the series to take his tally to 351 so far in the two Tests. Kallis and Smith ground the bowlers down with a mixture of caution and positive play after South Africa lost Herschelle Gibbs (16) and Hashim Amla (17) before tea in a total of 66 for two. Gibbs was caught behind off pacer Umar Gul and Amla was bowled in the penultimate over before tea through the gate by left arm spinner Abdul Rehman. Rehman had earlier batted tenaciously for an unbeaten 25 runs with Misbah-ul-Haq top scoring on 41 runs. Misbah who hit six fours in his 93-all innings put on 39 with Rehman after Pakistan had slumped to 150 for six, losing the wickets of Inzamam and captain Shoaib Malik (1) in the first five overs of the day. Misbah eventually became Ntinis first victim when he played a loose shot and was caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. Ntini, who has struggled for form, trapped Gul leg before with his next ball and had Danish Kaneria caught behind by Boucher off his final delivery of the over. It was Bouchers 400th dismissal in Test cricket and he is the first keeper to achieve the honour. South Africa lead the two-match series 1-0.  (REUTERS)

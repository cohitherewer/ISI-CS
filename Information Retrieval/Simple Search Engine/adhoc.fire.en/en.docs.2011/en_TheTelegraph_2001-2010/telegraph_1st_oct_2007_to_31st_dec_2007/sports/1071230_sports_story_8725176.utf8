 Symonds worried

 Andrew Symonds will not tour Pakistan next year if he is not satisfied with the political situation there. 
The PCB has guaranteed the Australian team a level of security above that of visiting Prime Ministers, but Symonds remains deeply concerned. 
Im not interested in going into a situation thats dangerous, where people are getting killed and hurt. Theres no point in that in my opinion, Symonds told The Daily Telegraph in Melbourne. 
Younis not surprised 
 Indias batting collapse in the first Test against Australia may have surprised many but not Pakistans middle-order mainstay Younis Khan, who feels Anil Kumbles men hardly stood a chance against the ruthless world champions. Younis said he was hardly surprised as the Australians were way ahead of the chasing pack when it came to mental toughness. 
Australia are the worlds top side because of their strong winning mentality. There were two days left in the Test match and they could have asked India to bat after setting them a target of 550 plus. Yet they declared on the third day and asked India to start the chase, Younis said. 
It shows the level of confidence of the Australians, he added.

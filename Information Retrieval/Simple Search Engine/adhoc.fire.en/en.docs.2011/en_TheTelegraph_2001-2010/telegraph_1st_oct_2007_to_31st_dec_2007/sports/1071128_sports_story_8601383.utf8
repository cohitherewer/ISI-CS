 Beckham bends one but LA Galaxy go down
 David Beckham, who scored with a typical curling free-kick against Sydney FC, in action on Tuesday. LA Galaxy lost 3-5. (AP) Sydney: David Beckham lit up the Olympic Stadium with a stunning free-kick but failed to inspire his LA Galaxy teammates in a 3-5 friendly loss to Sydney FC on Tuesday. The former England captain brought a crowd of over 80,295 to their feet when he curled in a trademark strike from 25 metres but it was a rare moment of joy for Galaxy who struggled in coach Ruud Gullits first game in charge. I was really happy to score in this game after all the build-up, Beckham told a news conference. It was an entertaining match with a few goals and thats what the fans wanted. The 32-year-old Beckham suffered an ankle injury early in the match and watched helplessly as his team gave away three early goals to hand their hosts a 3-0 lead. Beckham, playing in a deep-lying midfield role, hobbled on in obvious discomfort but he took his chance of glory two minutes before halftime. Galaxy were awarded a free-kick in a central position and, as he has so many times before, Beckham carefully placed the ball on the turf. He stepped up to whip the ball over the Sydney wall and it fizzed into the top corner of the net beyond the despairing dive of goalkeeper Clint Bolton. In that sort of situation there is always a certain amount of pressure but its something I have always practised, said the former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder. That always gives me a chance to score from positions like that. Galaxy pulled another goal back soon after the interval through striker Edson Buddle but Sydney, inspired by Brazilian Juninho, restored their two-goal cushion when Robbie Middleby tapped into an empty net. Beckham was the victim of two strong challenges and he was booked in the 64th minute for retaliating with a late tackle on Middleby before Galaxy defender Kevin Harmse was sent off as tempers flared. It got heated but there are not many games these days that are friendlies, Beckham said. It was all good fun and we had a laugh about it at the end. Sydney defender Iain Fyfe bundled the ball home from close range five minutes from time and US international Landon Donovan completed the scoring in the dying seconds. The Galaxy squad flies to New Zealand on Thursday for a friendly against Wellington Phoenix on Saturday. The MLS clubs tour Down Under went ahead on the proviso that Beckham played a decent part in matches against A-League clubs Sydney and Wellington Phoenix. Beckham is scheduled to appear at a perfume launch in Sydney on Wednesday before leaving for New Zealand and Saturdays match. His first game in Australia could have been over after 27 minutes with Galaxy behind 0-2, when Beckham lost his footing and was knocked over in a collision with Sydney midfielder Brendon Santalab. Santalab slipped as he covered Beckham, knocking over the former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder and creating a hush over Sydneys Olympic stadium. Beckham sat on his haunches, clutching his left ankle, but got up and continued. The Sydney side did not take it easy on Beckham in the second half, either. Robbie Middleby was cautioned for a bodycheck on the Galaxy captain in the 49th minute  but Beckham got some of his own back in the 64th. He slid in under Middleby, then got up, flashed a cheeky smile and hugged the Sydney player as referee Mark Shield produced a yellow card. Its part of the game  you get kicked but you carry on, Beckham said. The match was more of a marketing exercise than anything. Galaxy reportedly sold 20,000 jerseys in Australia. Sydney, which attracts an average of 15,200 for its domestic A-League matches, sold a record number of seats for a club soccer match in Australia. The Galaxys lack of match practice was obvious deep into their off season, and players from both sides misdirected passes that gave the first 20 minutes the look of a practice session. Beckham mixed with celebrities at a harborside function on Monday night, including an appearance from entertainer Elton John and actor Anthony LaPaglia, who stars in Without a Trace and is a part owner of Sydney FC. Beckhams wife, Victoria (Posh Spice) was preparing for the Spice Girls reunion tour and unable to travel with him. But impersonator Camilla Shadbolt, who earns a living posing as Victoria Beckham, flew in from Britain on Sunday and caused some confusion for locals with some cameos around the city. The Beckham-led Galaxy match is the teams first exhibition outside North America and was televised internationally.  (AGENCIES)

 Jeev soars to tied 15th 
Kochi: Jeev Milkha Singh revived his title defence after carding a brilliant four-under 68 in the second round to leap to tied 15th spot at the Casio World Open here on Friday. Jeev, who was languishing at the tied 43rd position after a poor 75 in the opening round, got his act together on Friday and reeled off six birdies against a couple of bogeys to shoot up with a total of one-under 143. It was a fine performance by the defending champion as he opened with a birdie-brace on the second and third before gaining another shot on the seventh. However, a bogey on the eighth hole saw him make the turn two-under. But Jeev did not let the setback bog him and fired birdies on the 10th and 14th. He dropped a shot on the 16th but rounded off the day well with a birdie on the 18th. At the top, Korean I. J. Chang returned a five-under 67 to take the sole lead with a total of eight-under 136. Local hope Taichi Teshima was a shot adrift after carding four-under 68. Another Japanese, Toru Taniguchi (69), occupied the third spot with a total of six-under 138. (PTI)

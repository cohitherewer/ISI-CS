 Player collapses on field, dies

Roddy Forsyth 
		Phil ODonnel
The singular poignancy which attends the death of any sportsman  the feeling that the laws of nature have been breached by the loss of one whose life was dedicated to fitness and vigour  is magnified for all at Motherwell by the sudden passing of Phil Donnell, who collapsed during the teams 5-3 home victory over Dundee United on Saturday. 
It is not only because the 35-year-old midfield player had achieved a late flowering of his manifest talent after a career frustratingly punctuated by serious injury, but also because the quietly spoken and courteous player-coach was also a husband and father of four. 
Donnell fell to the ground as he was about to be substituted towards the end of the game at Fir Park. He received five minutes of treatment on the field before being carried off on a stretcher and was then taken by ambulance to hospital. 
The midfielders nephew, David Clarkson, who had scored twice in the match, was substituted having been alarmed at the sight of his uncles collapse. 
The mood of disbelief was captured by Motherwells owner, John Boyle, when he said: Everyone at Motherwell is shocked to the core and we are sure that everyone involved in Scottish football will feel the same.

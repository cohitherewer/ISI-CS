 CPT take a point off Md. Sp.
A STAFF REPORTER Mike Okoro in a duel with a CPT defender on Monday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: In another poor and uninspiring display, hosts Mohammedan Sporting shared points with Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) after a goalless draw in the Sahara CFL Premier Division match on Monday. Mike Okoro, the man who was seen as the Calcutta giants saviour, couldnt do much as there was practically no supply of passes for him from the midfield. The Nigerian showed a lot of promise during the beginning but ultimately failed to do the needful. Okoro restricted himself particularly in the penalty box and didnt look like taking that extra responsibility required in these cases. The few chances Okoro managed to create were squandered either by himself or by his teammates for aimless shooting. Credit should also go to CPT goalie Amar Deb for his outstanding show under the bar. Deb at least made three outstanding saves to stand out in an otherwise lacklustre affair. Deb was deceived only once in the 53rd minute, when a Farooq Hyder cross from the right hit the horizontal. In fact, CPT would have won the match, had their goal in the 64th minute not been nullified. Henry Chukwukere headed home from a Srimanta Das free-kick from the left, but referee Barun Saha ruled Collins Eje off-side. The decision was criticised by CPT coach Amal Dutta later. The lowly-placed team couldnt create any opportunity and their efforts ended just outside the penalty box. The foreigners duo  Chukwukere and Collins  controlled the proceedings for Port Trust in patches. Koushik Prasad in the midfield, while Sujoy Chakraborty and Biswajit Kumar in the defence made it difficult for the black-and-whites. Both before and after the lemon break, Shabbir Ali-coached Mohammedan Sporting had most of the ball control. The home team missed at least four sitters. As the match was heading towards a draw, Duttas team had to face the ire of Mohammedan Sporting fans who engaged themselves in war of words with the coach. Stones were also hurled at the ground before Okoro pacified the enraged fans. Match was held up for a couple of minutes. Mohammedan Sporting had won the first-leg tie 4-2. Mohammedan Sporting are now with 13 points while CPT have nine. Both have played 11 matches each.

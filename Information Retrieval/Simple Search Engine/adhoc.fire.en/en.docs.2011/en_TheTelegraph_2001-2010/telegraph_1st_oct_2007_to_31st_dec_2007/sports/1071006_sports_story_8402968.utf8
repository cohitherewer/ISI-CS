 Gomes in joint lead
Yerevan: Padmini Rout upset top seed and favourite D. Harika in the second round of the World Junior Chess Championship on Friday.  Playing with white, Padmini got into a tricky position after the opening but maintained the dynamic balance with thoughtful manoeuvres. Harika tried to make headway and had to pay heavy dividends as Padmini fired at the black king. Among the Indian girls, Eesha Karavade outplayed Sona Pertlova and remained in joint lead along with Mary Ann Gomes, Soumya Swaminathan and Padmini. Six other girls, including sixth seed Vera Nebolsina of Russia, share the top spot with a 100 per cent score. In the boys event, GM Parimarjan Negi and GM G.N. Gopal continued with their winning ways. Negi had it easy against Viacheslav Kulakov of Russia while Gopal accounted for Amin Nasri of Iran.  (PTI)

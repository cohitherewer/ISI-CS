 Sons advice to maestro: Hit a six 
Gwalior: Had Sachin Tendulkar listened to his son, he might have had a century of centuries in international cricket by now. When the master batsman fell for 97 in the fourth ODI against Pakistan here, it was the 23rd time in Tests and ODIs that he had got out in the 90s. In ODIs, he has got out in the 90s as many as 16 times and in Tests seven times. He has 78 centuries to his credit  41 in ODIs and 37 in Tests  and the 23 missed ones would have taken his tally to 101. Asked about these string of failures, Sachin laughingly disclosed a solution offered by his son. My son told me to hit a six when on 94, he revealed. I guess I got into this wrong habit of getting out in the 90s. But for me, what matters most is that India have won, he said. The ODI century No. 42 is turning out to be a jinxed one for Sachin who has fallen in the 90s for six times this year and second time in the ongoing series. He fell short by just one run on three occasions. Umar Gul, who dismissed Sachin in Gwalior, also denied the batting genius a century in Mohali, removing him for 99 in the second ODI there. (PTI)

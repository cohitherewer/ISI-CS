 CRICKET BRIEFS 
						
					 Dispute continues						
	 Brisbane: International news agencies said there will be no coverage of the first Test between Australia and Sri Lanka because of a dispute with Cricket Australia (CA) over terms and conditions required for media accreditation. 					
	 They said that among the main issues are CA rsquo;s insistence that agencies pay for the right to license photos of CA events to editorial users, rights to distribute news and images from CA events to online news publishers, and the assertion by CA of an intellectual property interest in stories and images produced by journalists at CA events. 						
	 Trophy fate worries PCB						
	 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is hoping for a fast return of normalcy in the political situation as it fears a continuation of emergency may lead to the shifting of the 2008 ICC Champions Trophy. Sources in the board said that after the ICC decision to postpone the women rsquo;s World Cup qualifiers in Lahore this month, top officials are worried about the fate of the Champions Trophy.						
	 Test rankings						
	 Calcutta: Ricky Ponting rsquo;s pre-match suggestion that card games could be in order if rain delays the start of Australia rsquo;s first Test against Sri Lanka in Brisbane, is a pretty appropriate comment regarding the ICC Test Championship table. Though Australia are way above the pack, only eight points separate fourth-placed Sri Lanka from sixth-placed New Zealand, says A Staff Reporter. Australia will earn only two points if they win the series 2-0 but will lose nine points if beaten 0-2. A 2-0 or 1-1 result will help Sri Lanka leapfrog England and India into second place, according to an ICC release.						
	 IPL signings						
	 Mumbai: The BCCI-promoted Indian Premier League (IPL) on Wednesday formally announced the signing up of South African trio Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher and Makhaya Ntini, besides West Indian opener Chris Gayle and captain Ramnaresh Sarwan.						
	 Pak fans						
	 Amritsar: On Wednesday, a day before the second ODI of the ongoing series between India and Pakistan, 121 Pakistani fans arrived here on to see their side take on India at Mohali. The group came through the land route of Attari check post of the Indo-Pak international border. On Tuesday, seven fans had also taken the same route.						
	 Latif rsquo;s new role				 
	 Karachi: The PCB has sought the expertise of former Test captain and wicketkeeper Rashid Latif in trying to spot talents. Latif said he had been asked by PCB to recommend young wicketkeepers who could be groomed for the national side. ldquo;There is a dearth of quality keepers in the country and there is nothing wrong to have some back-up talent in the country, rdquo; he said.

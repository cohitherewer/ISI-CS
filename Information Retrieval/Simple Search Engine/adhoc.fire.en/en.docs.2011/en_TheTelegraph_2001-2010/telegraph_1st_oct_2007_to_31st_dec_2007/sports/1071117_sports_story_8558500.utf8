 Jeev Milkha improves to ninth
Miyazaki: Jeev Milkha Singhs fortunes kept oscillating as he turned in a roller-coaster two-under 68 to climb one spot to tied ninth after the second round of the $1.7 million Dunlop Phoenix Golf tournament here on Friday. The Indian had an eventful outing at the par-70 Phoenix Country Club, sinking in five birdies and an eagle against five bogeys to take his total to four-under 136. Playing his back nine first, Jeev opened with a bogey on the 10th and dropped two more shots on the 13th and 14th after striking a birdie on the 12th. Jeev then had a brilliant run in the last three holes of the back nine as he fired back-to-back birdies on the 16th and 17th before sinking in an eagle on the 560-yard par-five 18th hole. Making the turn two-under, Jeev stumbled to a bogey on the third but recovered to fire birdies on the fourth and fifth. But a dropped shot on the sixth denied him a better finish on the leader-board. Jeev is currently three shots adrift of joint leaders Ian Poulter and Padraig Harrington. While Poulter returned a two-under 68, defending champion Harrington shot a brilliant 65 to take a one-stroke lead over the Japanese duo of Singo Katayama (67) and Daisuke Maruyama (67) and Finlands Mikko Ilonen (65).

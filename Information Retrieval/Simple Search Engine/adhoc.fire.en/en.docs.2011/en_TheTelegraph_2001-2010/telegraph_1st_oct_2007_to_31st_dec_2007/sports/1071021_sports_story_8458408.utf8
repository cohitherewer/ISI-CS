 Rooney brace in 4-1 win
 Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney after Manchester Uniteds 4-1 win over Aston Villa on Saturday. (AFP) London: Liverpool scored in stoppage time to beat Everton 2-1 in a dramatic Merseyside derby on Saturday at Goodison Park as the hosts ended the match with nine men. Sami Hyypias own goal after 38 minutes gave Everton the lead in the 206th meeting between the city rivals, but fortune favoured Liverpool after the break as two Dirk Kuyt penalties got their title challenge back on track. The top seven in England all won with Arsenal maintaining their two-point lead over Manchester United, thanks to a 2-0 home defeat of Bolton Wanderers. A Kolo Toure long-ranger and a Tomas Rosicky tap-in broke Boltons resistance after the break as Arsenal made it 11 wins in a row in all competitions. United conceded their first goal in more than 10 hours as they fell behind at Aston Villa but stormed back with three goals in nine minutes before the break. Wayne Rooney was twice on target in the 4-1 victory, with Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs also chipping in. Villa had Nigel Reo-Coker and goalkeeper Scott Carson sent off after the break while Rooney had a penalty saved. Didier Drogbas future at Chelsea may be under a cloud but he scored the opener for the seventh-placed Blues as they continued their improvement with a 2-0 cruise at Middlesbrough. Manchester City remained third after a 1-0 win over Birmingham City. Portsmouth beat Wigan Athletic 2-0, while Blackburn Rovers beat Reading 4-2. Fourth-placed Liverpool looked set for more misery after last seasons 3-0 hammering when Hyypia crashed an attempted clearance past his keeper Pepe Reina. They levelled after 54 minutes when Everton defender Tony Hibbert tangled with Steven Gerrard in the box to concede a penalty and receive a red card from referee Mark Clattenburg. Kuyt scored from the spot to make it 1-1 and the Dutchman kept his nerve to convert another penalty in stoppage time after Phil Neville had been sent off for a flying save with his hand to deny Brazilian substitute Lucas.

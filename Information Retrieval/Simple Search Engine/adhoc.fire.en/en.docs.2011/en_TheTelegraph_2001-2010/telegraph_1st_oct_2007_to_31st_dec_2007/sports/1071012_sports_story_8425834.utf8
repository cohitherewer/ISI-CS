 Sachin is Kirmanis first choice
 - CAPTAINING TEAM INDIA IN TESTS LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Syed Kirmani Vadodara: Syed Kirmani, Indias first wicketkeeper-captain, has been bowled over by Mahendra Singh Dhonis freshness and dignified behaviour, but is against his getting the Test captaincy as well. Dhonis the man for the captaincy in all forms, but not at this point in time Let him settle down in the one-day game before giving him so much more responsibility, Kirmani told The Telegraph. Speaking on the sidelines of the fifth ODI, he added: In my view, the selectors should offer the Test captaincy to Sachin Tendulkar and, if he declines, then they ought to look at Sourav Ganguly That, I believe, is the way forward Besides Anil Kumble, Sachin and Sourav are the two senior-most cricketers and they deserve to be respected Giving the captaincy to one of them will be one big way of doing so Kirmani, also a former chief selector, said that Dilip Vengsarkar and Co. should anoint Dhoni as the one-day captain till the end of the season. That will lift his confidence even more, besides sending a strong signal to the dressing room. He added: Dhonis captaincy in the World Twenty20 was particularly impressive and, never before, have I seen the team gel so well They played for each other and the pressure situations were exceedingly well handled. According to Kirmani, arguably Indias greatest wicket-keeper, Dhonis work behind the stumps had improved, but there was room to get better. Kirmani, incidentally, declined to talk about his defeat in last months Karnataka State Cricket Association elections. Theres a lot that can be said, but Id rather not say anything Main mooh band rakhoon ga While the one and only Gundappa Viswanath failed to become president, Kirmani couldnt become one of the vice-presidents. They may have been teammates for years, but were in different camps during the elections.

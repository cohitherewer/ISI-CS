 Rennedy may miss Lebanon tie
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Bob Houghton could be forced to effect a couple of changes for Indias World Cup qualifier against Lebanon in Chennai on Sunday. Midfielder Rennedy Singh aggravated an old ankle injury, while N.S. Manju is down with fever and sat out of training on the final day of the national camp in Goa on Thursday. The Indians will fly to Chennai on Friday afternoon. The Lebanese are also expected to reach the venue two days before the game. Injured JCT defender T. Anwar has been ruled out, but Mehrajuddin Wadao and Bungo Singh are fit to play which should be welcome news for the Indian camp. India were routed 1-4 in Beirut and face the near-impossible task of winning the home match 3-0. We will monitor those with a doubt for a couple of days before taking a call, said Houghton. Should Rennedy be unavailable, K. Ajayan should step in to fill the breach. If Manju also misses out, Samir Naik and Syed Rahim Nabi will battle for that berth. On the last day of training, Houghton stressed on the need to score early and maintain a watertight defence. We must score during the first 45 minutes of play, said the India coach. During the week-long camp in Goa, Houghton emphasised on dead-ball situations and aerial battles. The tall Lebanese players are expected to beat the Indians in the air, but Houghton remained optimistic that his defenders will rise to the occasion.

 Bayern grab late winner
 - UEFA Cup
 -  Tottenham Hotspur slump to defeat at home  Bayern Munichs Lukas Podolski (right) tries to get past Red Star Belgrades Milos Bajalica in Belgrade on Thursday. (Reuters) London: Substitute Toni Kroos hit a last-gasp winner as four-time European champions Bayern Munich came from behind to win 3-2 at Red Star Belgrade in the Uefa Cup on Thursday. Twice winners Tottenham Hotspur slumped to a 1-2 home defeat against Spains Getafe and afterwards confirmed they had sacked their Dutch coach Martin Jol. Bayern broke Red Stars hearts in the Serbian capital as the Germans, who missed out on a Champions League berth, left it late to win their opening group F tie although manager Ottmar Hitzfeld described it as a fortuitous win. Serbia winger Ognjen Koroman had fired Red Star  who overcame Bayern in the last four en route to winning the European Cup in 1991  ahead with a crisp low shot on 16 minutes but Germany striker Miroslav Klose silenced the raucous 45,000 home crowd with a close-range tap-in after keeper Ivan Randjelovic could only parry Lucios fierce shot. A depleted Bayern side  without Franck Ribery, Luca Toni and defenders Martin Demichelis and Daniel van Buyten  fell behind again on 74 minutes when midfielder Nenad Milijas beat Michael Rensing with a swerving shot from 25 metres. But Klose was left completely unmarked to head home a deep cross from the left in the 85th minute, and after Red Star centre back Milos Bajalica had been sent off in injury time for a second bookable foul, Kroos lashed in the winner. On a perfect night for German sides, there were also wins for Bayer Leverkusen and Hamburg SV. Leverkusen, the 1988 winners, overcame Toulouse 1-0 at home in group E with a first-half goal from Stefan Kiessling while Hamburg won by the same scoreline at newly crowned Norwegian champions Brann Bergen. Belgian defender Vincent Kompany got the only goal just after the hour. Tottenham had hoped to get a morale-boosting win in group G at home to Primera Liga strugglers Getafe but it was another disappointing night for the White Hart Lane faithful. Striker Jermain Defoe, handed a rare start, headed Spurs in front on 19 minutes but Ruben de la Red got the faintest of touches to midfielder Esteban Graneros free-kick to beat keeper Radek Cerny for the equaliser. Braulio finished off a superb Getafe move on 70 minutes, back-heeling in a David Cortes cross for the winner. Zenit St Petersburg and AZ Alkmaar shared points in group A after a 1-1 draw in Russia, the Dutch side holding out for the entire second half with 10 men. AZ, semi-finalists in 2005, had led through Brazilian Ari who scored with a low shot after 20 minutes but the striker was sent off for retaliating six minutes before the break. Zenit, managed by Dutchman Dick Advocaat and challenging strongly to win a first Russian title with three games to go, swiftly capitalised just before half-time when Ukraine midfielder Anatoly Tymoschuk levelled from the penalty spot. Argentine teenaged striker Sergio Aguero rescued a point for Atletico Madrid with a goal five minutes from time to earn a 3-3 draw with Lokomotiv Moscow in their group B clash. (Reuters)

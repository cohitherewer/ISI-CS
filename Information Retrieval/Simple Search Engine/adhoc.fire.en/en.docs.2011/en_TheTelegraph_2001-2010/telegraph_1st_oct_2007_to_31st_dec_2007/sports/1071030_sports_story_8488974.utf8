 Referee charged
London: The FA on Monday took the unusual step of charging referee Danny McDermid with using abusive and/ or insulting words towards Leeds United manager Dennis Wise after a fiery English League One match last month. McDermid sent Wise to the stands at halftime of the match on Sept. 29 as Leeds drew 1-1 at Gillingham and had two players sent off. The FA said Wise had been fined 5,000 ($10,280) and given a three-match touchline ban for using abusive and/ or insulting words towards McDermid at halftime in the third division match.  (REUTERS)

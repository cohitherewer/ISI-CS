 Anil Kumble factfile
 Age: 37 years 22 days  Place of birth: Bangalore  Major teams: India, ACC Asian XI, Karnataka, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Surrey  Test debut: vs England in Manchester, Aug. 9-14, 1990  Tests: 118 Runs: 2212 HS: 110 .. Wkts: 566 Best: 10/74  ODI debut: vs Sri Lanka in Sharjah, April 25, 1990  ODIs: 271 Runs: 938 HS: 26 Wkts: 337 Best 6/12  The match-winning bowler has scripted memorable wins in Headingley, Adelaide, Multan and Kingston. An improved googly, bigger sidespin and more variation in flight has seen him achieve much success and admiration in recent years.  In February 1999 at the Kotla in Delhi he took all 10 wickets in an innings against Pakistan.  In December 2001, on home turf in Bangalore, he became Indias first spinner to take 300 Test wickets. A year later, almost to the day, he became the first to do so in one-dayers.  In 2002 in Antigua, Kumbles proved his dedication when he came on to the field to bowl with a heavily bandaged fractured jaw.  In January 2002, he led India in an ODI against England in Chennai.  In August 2007 at the Oval he went past Glenn McGraths 563 wickets to move to No.3 on the all-time list, behind only Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan.  In the same Oval Test he chalked up a century that had been 17 years and 118 matches in coming.  On November 8, 2007 Kumble was appointed captain for the three Test series against Pakistan.

 Win in Bangalore was a turning point for our cricket: Inzamam
 - The former Pakistan captain, whos being missed at Eden, looks back on his career LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI A TELEGRAPH SPECIALCalcutta: It was only recently that Inzamam- ul Haq played his farewell Test but, clearly, Pakistan couldve done with the titans services in India. The other day, in a chat with The Telegraph, Inzamam (now part of the Indian Cricket League) listed the special moments in his illustrious career  8,830 runs (25x100) in Tests and 11,739 (10x100) in ODIs. Here goes in Inzamams chosen order:  The 1992 World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in Auckland My innings of 60 took Pakistan to a World Cup final for the first time and, of course, fetched me the MoM award It meant the world, for I was still fairly new to international cricket and, till the semis, hadnt fared very well in the tournament. Mere liye bahut badi baat thi.  The 1992 World Cup final versus England in Melbourne I didnt score very big (42), but who can forget that March evening? Collectively, it remains our biggest achievement and, looking back, Im happy that I played some role in creating history.  The 329 in the Lahore Test against New Zealand (2001-02) Har batsman ki lambi innings khelne ki khwahish hoti hai It was very hot and I remember getting cramps when around 270... But I thought if I was in such discomfort in home conditions, what would be the state of the New Zealand players? Surely, they would be getting more affected Eventually, I missed Hanif Mohammeds Pakistan record (337) by a few runs (Adds laughing) Actually, it had come to such a stage that the New Zealanders were wanting me to quickly break the record in the hope that our innings would then come to a close and their misery would end!  The 138 not out (second innings) versus Bangladesh in 2003-04 in Multan Special because it was my comeback series Overnight, I think we needed 90-odd with just three wickets in hand It quickly became two when Shabbir Ahmed got a poor decision Once he got out (205 for eight, requiring 56 more) the fielders were pushed to the boundary and it became tough to get runs Main bahut pressure mein aa gaya The Bangladesh captain, though, made a mistake at that stage by claiming the second new ball It worked to my advantage and, thankfully, we managed to win by one wicket.  The 57-run partnership for the tenth wicket with Mushtaq Ahmed in the dramatic win against Australia in Karachi in 1994-95 Mushy played a terrific lending hand (20 not out) and I remember telling him it was difficult making out which one of us was the specialist batsman! He did that good a job The winning runs, however, came off byes I stayed unbeaten on 58.  The 184 in his 100th Test, in Bangalore, on Pakistans last tour of India (2004-05) In fact, we won that Test and were thus able to draw the series That, in some ways, was a turning point for our cricket as we recorded a high percentage of wins in the months immediately after that Woh Test hamesha ahmiyaat rakhe ga. Finally, his biggest disappointment Exiting in the first round of this years World Cup. With key players (like Shoaib Akhtar) either not available for the entire tournament or, like Shahid Afridi, not available for the first few matches, the odds didnt favour us from the beginning Whatever, it still hurts.ON THE LATE BOB WOOLMER On the morning Bob Woolmer rsquo;s body was found at the Pegasus Hotel in KingstonI got a call in my room some 30 minutes after Bob had been found unconscious hellip; I wasn rsquo;t told of his exact condition, though hellip; The security personnel had taken charge and no one was being allowed into his room hellip; I introduced myself and requested that I be given just one look hellip; They relented, mushkil se, and I saw Bob lying outside the bathroom... I rsquo;d been under the impression that he rsquo;d merely taken ill, but he was absolutely motionless hellip; Dekhne se maloom chala ki halat bahut kharab thi hellip; That rsquo;s the last I saw of my coach. On the period immediately after that (Emotionally) It was like hell hellip; The worst days of my life hellip; We wanted to quickly get out of the West Indies hellip; The team had never imagined that each one would come under suspicion and that so many theories would begin to do the rounds hellip; If somebody had to kill anybody for our shock exit, then wouldn rsquo;t I (as captain) have been the No.1 target? On Woolmer as coachHe was good hellip; Knew how to prepare the team hellip; Knew how to lift its morale hellip; We had a pretty successful partnership hellip; I remember his message for all of us on the last tour of India was lsquo;never panic rsquo; hellip; That held us in good stead.Finally, on what he remembers  most about WoolmerThe joy on his face when we beat India at the Kotla to win the ODIs hellip; I rsquo;d never seen him so happy before that evening and never saw him as happy thereafter.LPS

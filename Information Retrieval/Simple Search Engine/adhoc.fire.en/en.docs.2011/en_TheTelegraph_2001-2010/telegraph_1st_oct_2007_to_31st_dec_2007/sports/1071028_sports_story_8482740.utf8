 I was expecting a call: Sehwag
Ahmedabad: Virender Sehwag Saturday said he was happy to get back into the side and hoped to repeat his past performance against Pakistan. I was hopeful that my name would come up because in the past I had done well against Pakistan, he said. I am hopeful of repeating my performance in the coming series. Asked whether he felt bad for Rahul Dravid, he said: Dravid is a great player and has scored over 10,000 runs in one-day Internationals. Therefore I feel bad for him but it all depends on the selectors. I was expecting a call against the Australians too but I was injured then. Asked how it felt being left out, Sehwag said: It was a nightmare. Sehwag said fitness drills have benefited him a lot. I have lost weight and my fielding and running between the wickets have improved. On the Pakistan series, he said: They are a good, tough and a young side. They have bowlers like Shoaib, Asif and Umar Gul who have been playing well in the last two to three years and it is not easy to play against quality fast bowling. He said that he would bat in any position. I am very confident, I have got runs today. (PTI)

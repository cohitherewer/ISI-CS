 Jeev gets ready for a tough time at home
New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh is not expecting an easy time when he tees off at the Indian Open later this month. Instead, he is bracing for the treacherous greens that will greet him on his return to the Delhi Golf Course during the October 11-14 Asian Tour event. The DGC has been given a facelift that stretches it beyond the 7,000-yard mark in preparation for the Indian Masters to be held next year. Three crucial holes have undergone massive changes, including the par-three seventh that has been stretched from a modest 182 yards to a massive 230 yards. Jeev, however, is not losing any sleep, for hostility often brings out the best in him and while precision could be at a premium, he feels course management will be the key. Traditionally at the DGC, one always has to be very accurate off the tee and now that they have added length, it will be even more difficult, he said. Jeev is aware that he will have to shoulder the additional burden of expectation at home. Im looking forward to it. As of now, Im going to the Dunhill (championship) and it will be freezing cold there. Ill be back in the warmth of Delhi and playing at home after a long gap is something Im excited about. (PTI)

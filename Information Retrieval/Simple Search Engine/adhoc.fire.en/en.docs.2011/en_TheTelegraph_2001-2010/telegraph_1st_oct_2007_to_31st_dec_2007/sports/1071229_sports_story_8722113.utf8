 Joey Barton refused bail

THE TIMES, LONDON AMP; AGENCIES
Joey Barton, the Newcastle United midfielder, will remain in custody until January 3 after he was refused bail when he appeared before Liverpool magistrates charged with common assault and affray. 
He was arrested by Merseyside Police along with another man and a woman in the early hours of Thursday after two men were attacked in Church Street, a busy retail area in Liverpool city centre just after 5.30am. 
Barton, 25, appeared at Liverpool Magistrates Court for a 45-minute bail hearing required because the alleged offence took place while he was already on bail for two other separate offences. 
Andrew Barton, 19, who was charged with actual bodily harm and Nadine Wilson, 27, who was also charged with common assault and affray, were both released on bail. 
The victims of the alleged assault were not said to be seriously hurt and did not require hospital treatment. Barton has a history of disciplinary problems, but has worked with the Sporting Chance Clinic, the charity established to deal with those issues.

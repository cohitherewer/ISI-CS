 Pak bowled better in slog overs: Dhoni
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTJaipur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni has his feet firmly on the ground despite winning a historic one-day series against Pakistan. On Sunday, when the Indian captain met the media after Pakistan won the inconsequential fifth and final ODI, he was full of praise for the visitors from across the border. We didnt win today because they played much better than us, he said. Pakistan batted brilliantly, especially between 20 and 40 overs. Thats the time when they walked away with the match. Dhoni said India won the series but Pakistan were better in few aspects of the game. They bowled better than us in the death overs. They were also slightly better than us in fielding. Losing wickets at regular intervals was the main reason for Indias defeat on Sunday, said the wicketkeeper batsman. But then, it was not easy chasing 300-plus. Some days you chase successfully. Sometimes you dont. Asked about Sourav Gangulys exclusion from the final XI, Dhoni said: He was rested. Thats all. He also defended the youngsters, saying all of them performed well. There is no point blaming Rohit Sharma for losing his wicket when he was doing well, the captain said. The Test series, Dhoni said, would be a different ball game altogether. Because of the busy schedule, we didnt get much time to talk to Anil bhai (Kumble). Now we will go to Delhi and sit together and plan out things. Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik said: Now we are going into the Test series with great confidence. So far we were batting well only to end up with a score of around 260. Today we could notch up 300-plus and that was the reason behind our success. Asked why Mohammed Yousuf didnt field, Malik said he suffered a elbow injury. Theres nothing serious. But since the doctor has advised rest, we decided not to field him.

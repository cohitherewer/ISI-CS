 Four teams in fray for second spot
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: India, Sri Lanka, England or South Africa will be No.2 by the end of this year, with Australia way in front. According to an ICC release, the second spot in the LG ICC Test Championship is up for grabs over the next few weeks and four teams are in contention, depending on how the India versus Pakistan and Sri Lanka versus England series pan out. England are the current occupiers but their place is under threat with both India and Sri Lanka capable of overtaking them if they do well in their respective series. And depending on results, even South Africa could sneak into second spot ahead of their Test series against the West Indies, which gets underway on 26 December in Port Elizabeth. As the second Test between India and Pakistan begins on Friday in Calcutta, the hosts are already 1-0 up in the series and could finish on 112 points, one more than Englands current tally if they win the series 3-0. Michael Vaughans side have the chance to maintain their place behind leaders Australia, provided they can prevail over Sri Lanka. The Test series begins on Saturday in Kandy. Mahela Jayawardene and his men will know that a good showing could propel them from their current position of fifth right into second. Such is the congested nature of the table that just six points separate England in second and Sri Lanka in fifth. TEST STANDINGS 1. Australia 143; 2. England 111; 3. South Africa 109; 4. India 107; 5. Sri Lanka 105; 6. Pakistan 96; 7. New Zealand 91; 8. West Indies 72; 9. Bangladesh 65.

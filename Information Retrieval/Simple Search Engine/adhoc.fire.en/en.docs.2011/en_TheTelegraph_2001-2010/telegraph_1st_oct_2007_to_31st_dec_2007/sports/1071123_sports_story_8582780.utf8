 Sourav lauds Yuvraj
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Former captain Sourav Ganguly on Thursday praised Yuvraj Singh and said his presence in the squad didnt put him under any pressure. I have been through this earlier also... If you look at my performance in the last 10/11 months, I have done exceptionally well. At the same time I also feel good when Yuvraj bats well, Sourav said. Yuvraj was the Man of the Series in the recently concluded one-day series but couldnt find a place in the Test XI. Sourav said Yuvrajs recent performance has left him proud. Yuvraj is pushing for a place... At this level someone or the other will be knocking at your door. When Rahul (Dravid) and I started our careers, then we knocked out Sanjay (Manjrekar) and (Navjyot Singh) Sidhu, who were established cricketers. But this is good as it keeps you on your toes and you have to perform, said the 34-year-old. I think after playing 10/12 years of Test cricket, Yuvraj will also face the same competition from the youngsters, Sourav added.

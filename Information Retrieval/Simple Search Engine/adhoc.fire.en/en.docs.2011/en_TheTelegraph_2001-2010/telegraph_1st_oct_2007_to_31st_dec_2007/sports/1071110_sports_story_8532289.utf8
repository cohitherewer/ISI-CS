 Movie break for Indians
Chandigarh: A few members of the Indian cricket team including skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni watched Shah Rukh Khan starrer Om Shanti Om at a multiplex here on Friday while Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar visited an orphanage. While a few players of the Indian team including Virender Sehwag left the city to be with their family on Diwali eve, others like Dhoni, Robin Utthapa and Irfan Pathan went to a multiplex here in the afternoon to watch the movie, released on Friday. Senior players Sachin Tendulkar, his wife Anjali, son Arjun and daughter Sara along with Sourav Ganguly and his wife and daughter also accompanied Dhoni and Co. Local lad Yuvraj Singh drove around the city in his yellow sports car, attracting attention of his fans. At the multiplex too, the Indian team was mobbed by fans who were pleasantly surprised to see their favourite cricketing heroes in flesh and blood. Dhoni could be seen having popcorn and looked in a relaxed mood. The Indian cricketers have planned to celebrate Diwali in a quiet manner, team sources said. Pakistani team members remained locked in their hotel rooms. However, pacer Shoaib Akhtar went to an orphanage in Chandigarh and spent some time with the special children there. Shoaib said he was touched by meeting the children. He said is was a big occasion for him, almost equal to the happiness he gets when Pakistan wins, when he met the children. Charity is close to my heart. Even in Australia, I raised funds for bone marrow bank and have been taking up cancer cause as well, he said.  (PTI)

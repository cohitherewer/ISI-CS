 Its not always possible to fulfil expectations, says Harbhajan

 - Indias most successful off-spinner joins the 250 club 
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
			Harbhajan Singh took three wickets on Friday
Melbourne: Harbhajan Singh didnt take a wicket in Australias first innings, but three for 101 in the second took him past the 250 tally in Tests. Not many have got there and, so, Harbhajan had reason to smile when he met the media after stumps on Friday. Briefly, he also spoke to The Telegraph separately. 
The following are excerpts 
On the 499-run target set by Australia 
Obviously, its a stiff one, but I wont say its not achievable... With the batting line-up weve got, anything is possible... The batsmen are looking to show character and, if we do win, the result will help us in the (four-Test) series... If the batsmen play to potential, then we can definitely surprise... We wont be looking at the 180 overs that remain, but look at the last two days session by session... Its a slow wicket, but isnt difficult if you play with a straight bat. 
On whether its more a mental fight now 
Dil, dimag, skills... Sab le ke ladna hai... No one quality alone will do. 
On why Team India got bowled out for under 200 in the first innings 
We didnt get much time to acclimatise... It takes time to adjust... 
On who needs more time to adjust  batsmen or bowlers 
(Laughs) Both. 
On the approach he took in the second innings vis-a-vis the first 
Bowled a little slower and tried out new angles... The wicket hardly has anything for the finger spinners... 
On having again got Ricky Ponting, his 250th victim 
Hes no doubt a very good player and its nice to get him out. 
On the exchange between him and Ponting after he was hit on the ribcage by Brett Lee on Thursday 
He asked whether the ball had gone out of shape! 
On getting to 250 Test wickets 
Bahut achcha lag raha hai... Id gone for so many in my first Test (two for 136 in Bangalore, 1997-98) that Id thought I would only play one... Fortunately, Ive now played 61. 
On dedicating his achievement 
(Emotionally) To my late father... Whether its my 150th or 250th, its all for him... Im fulfilling his dream... 
On getting his 250th wicket at the MCG 
I call it Shane Warnes ground. 
On the difference between the Harbhajan of 2001, who (with 32 wickets) scripted the Australians defeat in the Test series in India, and the Harbhajan of today 
The same, except being a bit older... I was very raw then... Today, theres more responsibility and Ive matured... The expectations have risen, but its not always possible to fulfil them... I think I should be judged on how I bowl and not by the number of wickets I take... Im only 27 and hope to do an Anil Kumble (who, at 37, is still going strong). 
On whether having a bowler-captain makes a difference 
It does... Kumble is very clear about what he wants and knows a bowlers mind very well. 
On bowling in tandem with Kumble 
Weve got a good understanding and, when were bowling together, I expect him to create pressure from his end. 
On whether hes now a less aggressive bowler 
Thats not true as I continue to look for wickets... Much depends on the mindset and I always think positively. 
On the difference in bowling to the Australians in India and in their own backyard 
Theyre more confident at home... Theyll step out... In India, they arent confident about being defensive... 
On the rather flat ground fielding 
Were trying our best but, as a unit, we need to improve. 
Finally, on having undergone surgery the last time Team India played a Boxing Day Test here 
(After a pause) It was a bad time... Id rather not think of those days...

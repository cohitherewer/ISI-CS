 Woods claims 8th title of year

Thousand Oaks: Tiger Woods shrugged off three bogeys and an early challenge from Jim Furyk to win the Target World Challenge by seven shots on Sunday. This was his eighth victory of the year. 
The world No. 1, six ahead of the pack overnight, fired a four-under-par 68 at Sherwood Country Club to claim his fourth title in the elite 16-man tournament he hosts. 
Woods stretched his lead to seven strokes over the first two holes before it was trimmed to just two by playing partner Furyk over a cut-and-thrust outward nine. 
Furyks faint victory hopes were extinguished by a double-bogey at the par-three 15th, where he found water off the tee for the second day in a row, and Woods eagled the par-five 16th on his way to a winning total of 22-under 266. 
It got a little bit interesting there, Woods told reporters after returning to the winners circle following a two-and-a-half month break. 
Jimmy put a ton of heat on me the front nine and then all of a sudden the whole tournament switched on the 10th. That was a big two-shot swing there. Today was a little bit scrappy and I didnt feel quite right with my swing. But I felt comfortable with my putter all four days this week. 
World No. 3 Furyk, who had piled the pressure on Woods with five birdies in the first eight holes, closed with a 71 to finish third at 13 under, two behind Masters champion Zach Johnson (68) 
Woods, overwhelming favourite going into the final round, appeared to have the title firmly in his grasp after making a confident start in glorious winter sunshine.

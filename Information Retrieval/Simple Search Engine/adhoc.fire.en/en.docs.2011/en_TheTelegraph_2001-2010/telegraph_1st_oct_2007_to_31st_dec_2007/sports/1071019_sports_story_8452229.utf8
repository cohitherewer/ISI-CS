 Hamilton all set for acid test
 - Alonso will be doing everything in his control to win in Brazil ANDREW BAKER		Lewis HamiltonAs the Formula One circus assembled in Sao Paulo ahead of the final act of a thrilling season, drivers championship leader Lewis Hamilton played down the consequences of his error at the penultimate round in Shanghai. He missed his early opportunity to become the first rookie to win motor sports greatest prize when he slid into the gravel on severely worn tyres in China 10 days ago. But ahead of the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos on Sunday, the 22-year-old Briton still holds a four-point lead over McLaren rival Fernando Alonso, with Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen a further three points adrift. China was another valuable lesson for me, Hamilton insisted. I moved on from the disappointment pretty quickly and, since leaving Shanghai, my sole focus has been on Brazil. Interlagos is one of those circuits that everybody talks about. I understand it has a fantastic atmosphere, the fans are crazy for the sport, and the track lends itself to great racing. Its another new circuit for me, and there has been a lot of talk by other people about how its tricky to drive. Thats why I see it as a special challenge, and when I arrive at the track Ill study it hard with my engineers and start to get an understanding of it. He has performed well this season on tracks that are new to him, with victories on his first acquaintance with the circuits in Canada, the United States and Japan. Interlagos is long and bumpy, but the main difficulty for the drivers is that the cars run anticlockwise, so that the G-forces put an unusual strain on their necks. Turkey is the only other circuit on the calendar to run in this direction. Hamilton will have been hard at work in the 20 million simulator at McLarens Woking base, though, and will be ready for whatever the track and his rivals can throw at him. Given the title picture, Hamilton knows that he cannot afford the slightest error throughout the weekend. If Alonso, who has wrapped up the championship for the last two years at Interlagos, wins on Sunday, then Hamilton has to finish second. There is a confusing array of mathematical scenarios that could unfold, but Hamilton knows what he has to do. If he stays in Alonsos wheeltracks, and the pair remain close to Raikkonen, Hamilton will win the crown. But the track is notorious for chaotic races. Ive had some great races with the team this year, and I hope to have another one in Interlagos, Hamilton said. I might be ahead by four points, but the championship is still very open. Ill do what I can to score the points I need, and the rest is out of our hands. Meanwhile Alonso, Hamiltons teammate and main opponent for the title, has been taking a more peaceful line than of late, saying that he is confident of receiving the equality he seeks ahead of what is likely to be his final Grand Prix with McLaren. This seasons duel has been overshadowed by Alonsos insinuations that he is not receiving the same treatment as Hamilton following a bitter fall-out. But Alonso believes the recent plea from Carlos Gracia, the head of the Spanish motor sport federation, on his behalf will ensure McLaren are impartial this weekend. Im sure were going to Brazil with full equality across the team and two cars capable of fighting for victory, in the race and the championship, the Spaniard said. Although Im now only four points away from Lewis, I still need for there to be a lot of circumstances in my favour for me to win the drivers title. But for sure I will be doing everything thats under my control to make it happen. I have to do my bit and then hope that everything else falls into place.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

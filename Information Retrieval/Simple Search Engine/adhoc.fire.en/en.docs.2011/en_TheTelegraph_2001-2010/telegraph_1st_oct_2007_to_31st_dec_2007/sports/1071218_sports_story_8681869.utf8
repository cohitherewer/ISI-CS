London: Fabio Capello has officially been unveiled as the new England manager saying it was vital that an English coach is integrated into his coaching set up. 
Capello said the Englishman would act as a guide to the football culture of his adopted country and stressed the need to quickly restore pride in wearing the national shirt. 
After reading a prepared statement in English, Capello answered questions through an interpreter, though he clearly understood much of what was being said, and vowed to learn enough English in the month between now and his first meeting with his new players to be able to communicate freely with them. 
I am very proud and honoured to be the England manager. I have wanted this job for a long time, he said in English. 
Its an honour to be the coach, and its a dream come true. Its a job that everybody wants and everybody knows there are great expectations with the job and I will work to achieve these with the FA. 
I am convinced this is a great team and can go right to the top. 
Capello insisted his multi-million pound contract meant less to him than being successful. 
Money is really a secondary issue. Its important but obviously secondary, he said. The main issue we have to deal with is the results. 
Doubts had been voiced over the Italians lack of English and the new England manager conducting his first press conference with the aid of an interpreter will only add to that disquiet. 
However, Capello  who claims to have learned Spanish in a month when he first joined Real Madrid  made light of such concerns. 
Im convinced that, in one month, when the national squad will meet for the first time under me, I will be able to speak the language, he said. 
I believe that its very important to be able to communicate with the players and, for sure, I will undertake a really strict routine for myself. I will apply myself every day and I want to learn the language in time to meet the players next month. 
Im going to try to understand whats happened by talking to the players and I believe that wearing the England shirt should be a matter of pride and I want to see all players play for England like they do for their clubs. 
Capello becomes the second foreign manager to lead England after Sven-Goran Eriksson and was reluctant to be drawn in to a discussion about the rights and wrongs of England looking overseas for a coach. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

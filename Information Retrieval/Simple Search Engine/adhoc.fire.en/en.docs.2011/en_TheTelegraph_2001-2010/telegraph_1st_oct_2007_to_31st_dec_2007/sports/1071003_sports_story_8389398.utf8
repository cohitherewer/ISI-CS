 Conditions were playable: Brijesh
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTKochi: The Karnataka State Cricket Association secretary, Brijesh Patel, is upset that umpires Steve Bucknor and Suresh Shastri abandoned the first ODI, in Bangalore on Saturday, even though conditions were playable. The fielding captain (Adam Gilchrist) didnt have a problem and there were no puddles in the outfield... To my mind, 20 overs of the Indian innings couldve been completed... Conditions were playable, Patel told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the second ODI. Patel, a former India batsman and senior selection committee chairman, added: The spectators deserved to see a result and its very disappointing that the ODI will be remembered as one which got abandoned.

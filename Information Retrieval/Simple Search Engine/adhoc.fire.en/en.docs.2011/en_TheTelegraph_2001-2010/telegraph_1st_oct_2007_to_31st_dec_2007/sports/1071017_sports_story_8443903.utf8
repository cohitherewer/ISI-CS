 FA could turn to Special One
MARTIN SAMUEL Jose Mourinho Jos Mourinho would be allowed to take the England head coachs job, were defeat in Russia to spell the beginning of the end for Steve McClaren. The conditions of Mourinhos termination agreement with Chelsea, which left him unable to respond to interest from Tottenham Hotspur last month, would not apply if were he to work in international football, even with England. As part of his settlement on leaving Stamford Bridge, Mourinho agreed that he would not work for another Premier League club until next season, but the terms did not cover all posts within English football, leaving him free to be employed by the FA, if Englands European Championship qualifying campaign was to suffer a severe setback in Moscow. Defeat at the Luzhniki Stadium on Wednesday would leave McClarens job hanging by a thread. Although the FA would not remove him until after the European Championship qualifying campaign was officially concluded with the match at home to Croatia on November 21, even McClaren privately admits that his position would be untenable if England failed to qualify for next summers tournament in Austria and Switzerland. And while defeat by Russia would not guarantee Englands elimination, it would leave McClarens group E rivals in the box seat. Russia would be required to win in Israel and then at home to Andorra to make certain of qualifyings. Whatever England achieved against Croatia would then be irrelevant. The FA would not make any move officially in the aftermath of a reversal of fortune in Moscow but, internally, informal discussions regarding McClarens successor could be taking place as early as this week, if the result went wrong. Mourinhos name would be certain to feature heavily in conversations within and without Soho Square, were that the case. He is readily available and has a tremendous track record in English and continental football. Winner of back-to-back Premier League titles with Chelsea, the FA Cup and two League Cups, he previously landed an unlikely Champions League triumph with Porto, dominated the Portuguese league and has an excellent reputation as a motivator and coach.

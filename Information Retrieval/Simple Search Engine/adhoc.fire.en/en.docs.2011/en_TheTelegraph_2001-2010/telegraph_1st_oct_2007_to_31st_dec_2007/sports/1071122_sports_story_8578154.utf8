				 																																	Baghdatis for Chennai Open				 																																	Calcutta: World No. 16 Marcos Baghdatis has confirmed participation in the $430,000 Chennai Open to be held from December 31 to January 6, according to a press release issued on Wednesday.				 																																	The Cypriot is the second top-20 player to enter the 2008 edition of the Chennai ATP meet, after Russian Mikhail Youzhny. It will be the maiden appearance at this venue for both men.				 																																	Spaniard Carlos Moya has also confirmed for Chennai.				 																																	The 22-year-old Baghdatis had also entered the Mumbai ATP meet two months ago, but had to pull out late because of an injury.				 																																	Baghdatis, who served notice of his talent by reaching the 2006 Australian Open final (he lost Roger Federer), rose to world No. 8 in August that year. He is one of only three players to have broken into the top-10 before winning a Tour title.				 																																	Kuala Lumpur: World number two Rafael Nadal joined Roger Federer on Wednesday in playing down the threat posed by match-fixing, saying tennis was 100 per cent clean. When asked if he thought the issue had been blown out of proportion, Nadal said: Totally agree. Im sure everything is 100 per cent clean.				 																																	His thoughts echoed those of world number one Federer, who said after winning the Masters Cup in Shanghai on Sunday: Its a great sport. Its a clean sport and I hope that in the future its going to stay this way. 				 																																	The Newcastle striker has been sent by his club to see renowned Munich-based specialist Dr Hans Muller-Wolfhart for advice on thigh damage he sustained during Englands 1-0 victory over Austria last Friday. Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce, who had sent a member of his medical team to monitor Owens progress in Vienna, said: We have sent Michael to Germany to see Dr Wolfhart in a bid to speed up his recovery.

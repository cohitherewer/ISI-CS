 Lead of about 300 would suffice: Butt
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Pakistan opener Salman Butt said on Saturday that a lead around 300 would be enough to beat India in the first Test. I think a target around 300 would be difficult to achieve, said Butt at the end of third days play. The pitch is keeping slow and low and chasing 300 on the last day will be tough for India. But we have to bowl really well. After all, India have some fine batsmen in their side. [Former captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Saturday praised successor Shoaib Malik, saying he had shown aggressiveness in the first Test, adds agencies in Chennai. If a side fights back after conceding the first-innings lead, it means that Pakistan players have shown character. Our bowlers have to keep the momentum going to win the match, he said.] The first session on Sunday could prove to be the turning point of the match, Butt said. The match is evenly poised and the first session tomorrow will decide the fate of this Test. Asked why there was a slump in Pakistan batting after tea, Butt said: Cricket is a game of sessions. If we play the morning session on Sunday well then we can hope to win. Today there was less fog and lot of sunlight. Batting was relatively easy today. If the fog returns tomorrow, the bowlers will get help. It all depends when India take the new ball. Butt, who so far is the top scorer in Pakistan s second innings with 67, however, refused to blame the pitch for the batsmens failure. I dont think batsmen got out because of the pitch. Everyone got out because the bowlers bowled well.

 Visitors wary of Yuvraj
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Yuvraj Singh New Delhi: Shoaib Malik is relieved that Rahul Dravid has not been included in the Team India squad for the first two ODIs. On current form, however, the Pakistan captain sees Yuvraj Singh as the threat No.1. Interacting with the media a couple of hours after their arrival on Thursday, Malik said the Punjab left-hander could be a key factor in the upcoming series. India have quite a few top batsmen, but on current form, Yuvraj is the best, said Malik. He is playing very well and we would be happy to see him back early every time he comes out to bat. Malik also made no secret of the fact that he was happy to find Dravid out of the side. India should stick to youngsters but we are happy that Dravid is not in the team. He is a great batsman and has played some great innings. Malik was also full of praise for Rudra Pratap Singh. He has really proved himself, Malik said. In the last one year, he has improved the most. Frankly, he has become an extraordinary bowler. Both Malik and coach Geoff Lawson tried their best to give an impression that defeat in the World Twenty20 final was history. Yet they talked about giving a fitting reply. The loss in the Twenty20 final is history, said the 25-year-old Pakistan captain. We are now concentrating on the current series. On subcontinent wickets, a team can often score 300 batting first. Anyone who handles pressure well will come out winners. Lawson also echoed his skippers view. We are looking forward to play an exciting series. We have in mind the defeat in the Twenty20 final. We have a score to settle this time. The Pakistan coach said it would be an intensely-fought series without any bitterness. Yes, I did hear about things in the recently concluded India-Australia series I hope it would be different this time. The just concluded Pakistan-South Africa series, Lawson said, was a hard fought one but cricket was played in the right spirit. We played a tough, non-compromising series without exchanging a harsh word even once. This series should also be played in the same manner. On his feelings about an Indo-Pak series, Malik said he was excited but not tense. I have played against India before. It is always an exciting affair. But we are not unnecessarily tense. We know each other well. We speak Urdu You also speak Urdu. Whats the difference? The home team does have an advantage but it will be an equally fought series. Pakistan start the tour with a one-dayer against the Delhi Ranji Trophy side at the Kotla on Friday. Malik dismissed any notion of not getting enough support from senior players in the side. There is not much gap between us. I have full cooperation of players like (Mohammed) Yousuf bhai, (Shoaib) Akhtar bhai, he said. While the Taj Palace is usually the official hotel, the Pakistan squad is staying at Le Meridien. Apparently, theres a security angle to it.

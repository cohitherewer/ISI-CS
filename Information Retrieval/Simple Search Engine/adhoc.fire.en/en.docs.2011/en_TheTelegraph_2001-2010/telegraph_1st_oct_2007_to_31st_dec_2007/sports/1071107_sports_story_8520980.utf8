 Efficient wins Melbourne Cup 
 Melbourne: Efficient unleashed a devastating late sprint to win Tuesdays 147th running of the Melbourne Cup, Australias richest and most popular horse race.				 										Perfectly ridden by Michael Rodd, Efficient stormed home from near the back of the field to overhaul the English-trained Purple Moon in the shadows of the post.				 										Efficient, which paid Aus$22.40 for an Aus$1 investment, hit the front less than 20m from the finish of the gruelling 3,200m handicap. Irish stayer Mahler held on for third after leading the field into the final straight. Efficient was billed Australias next great horse after his brilliant win in last years Victoria Derby.				 										 (Reuters)

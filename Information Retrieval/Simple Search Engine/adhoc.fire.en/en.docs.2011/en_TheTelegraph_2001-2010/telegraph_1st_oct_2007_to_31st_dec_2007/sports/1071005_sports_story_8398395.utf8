 Kallis hits second century of match
 Jacques Kallis after reaching his century in Karachi on Thursday. (AFP) Karachi: Pakistans Younis Khan and Faisal Iqbal shared a big stand to hold up South Africas push for victory in the first Test after Jacques Kallis hit his second century of the match on the fourth day on Thursday. Younis (93 not out) and Faisal (44) put on 114 for the third wicket after Pakistan lost their openers quickly but left-arm spinner Paul Harris struck before the close to leave Pakistan on 146 for three, still needing 278 more runs to win. The visitors declared before tea to set the hosts a target of 424, with Kallis becoming only the fourth South African to compile two centuries in the same Test. Harris had Faisal caught by Kallis at slip with a sharp turning delivery. Younis was in a punishing mood, racing to 93 from 99 balls with 14 fours and a six. He and Faisal mixed caution with several glorious strokes after paceman Dale Steyn had removed Mohammed Hafeez (1) and Salman Butt (3). The 31-year-old Kallis, who scored 155 in the first innings, struck an unbeaten 100 in the second as South Africa declared on 264 for seven. Its great to get two hundreds, Kallis said. But we have an interesting days cricket ahead of us and some hard work. He shared a stand of 88 with Ashwell Prince (45) before the latter played on to a ball from leg-spinner Danish Kaneria. Kallis then teamed up with Mark Boucher (29) to put on 56 and with Andre Nel (33) for another stand of 63. Kallis was naturally a proud man on Thursday. It is a big moment for me to look back at, Kallis said. It was a spectacular return for Kallis after he was dropped for the recent World Twenty20. It would have been nice to play in the Twenty20 but on the other hand it has also allowed me to come to this series well rested, said the 31-year-old. Kallis said his first innings was better than his second. They were two totally different knocks, he said. One was a grinding innings just to make sure we got enough runs on the board to have enough fielders around the bat. The first one was better as I struck the ball better. Meanwhile, South African selectors have named Vernon Philander to replace the injured Morne Morkel in their squad touring Pakistan. Smith also said that Australian wicketkeepers Ian Healy and Adam Gilchrist had also sent messages of congratulations to Mark Boucher after he broke Healys world record for most Test dismissals as a wicketkeeper.

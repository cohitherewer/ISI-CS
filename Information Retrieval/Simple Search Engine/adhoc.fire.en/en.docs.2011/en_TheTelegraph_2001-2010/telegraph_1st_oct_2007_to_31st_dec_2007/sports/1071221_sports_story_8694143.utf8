 VRV takes five as Punjab beat Orissa 

Mohali: VRV Singh took five wickets for Punjab to help them beat Orissa by seven wickets on the final day of the Ranji Trophy Super League group B match on Thursday. 
Requiring 175 for victory, Punjab resumed on their overnight score of 117 for two and reached the target 31.2 overs. 
Overnight batsman Ravi Inder, who was at the crease on 47, hit a brilliant 74 before falling lbw to Niranjan Behera. His partner skipper Pankaj Dharmani did not bat as he got retired hurt after sprained his ankle during the warming up session earlier in the morning. Uday Kaul (21) and Ravneet Ricky (3) completed the rest of the formalities to give an easy win to Punjab, who earlier faced the threat of relegation. 
In Bangalore, Delhi and Karnataka bagged one point each after overnight rains and persistent drizzle forced their Super League group A encounter to be abandoned.

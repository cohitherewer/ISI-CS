 Christine wins battle against Olympic ban
Richard Neale amp; agencies Christine Ohuruogu London: Christine Ohuruogu has won her appeal against a lifetime Olympic ban and is now free to compete for Britain at next years Games in Beijing. The 400m world champion put forward her case in a three and a half hour appeal hearing on Monday and learnt this morning that the British Olympic Association (BOA) had accepted her reasons for missing three out-of-competition doping tests. The 23-year-old Londoner had appeared before a Sports Dispute Resolutions Panel and successfully overturned a BOA by-law precluding athletes found guilty of drug-test offences from competing in any future Games. A statement from the BOA said: The appeals panel unanimously agreed that the written evidence supplemented by the answers given by both parties at the oral hearing provided the necessary information to take an early decision in Christine Ohuruogus appeal. It was agreed that any delay in making the decision would not be in the interests of any of the involved parties. The panel decided that Christine Ohuruogus appeal had been successful due to significant mitigating circumstances. Further information regarding the panels reasoning will be made available at a later date but BOA chief executive Simon Clegg said they were happy to be able to welcome Ohuruogu into the team for Beijing. The BOA will now be pleased to welcome Christine Ohuruogu as part of Team GB in Beijing next year in the event of her successful nomination by UK Athletics, he said. Clegg also defended the procedures which led to the ban being imposed in the first place. The BOA and the panel both stress that no advance notice out of competition testing is a fundamental part of ensuring an effective fight against doping in sport, he added. Athletes must be fully aware of their obligations to keep their whereabouts information up to date at all times and must ensure that they are available for testing at the designated times and places. Ohuruogu, who in August sensationally won the 400m world championship title just three weeks after finishing a one-year suspension from the sport, is now clear to compete in Beijing next year. She had always been confident of winning the appeal with precedent on her side  Tim Don, the triathlete, and judo competitor Peter Cousins had automatic lifetime bans overturned for exactly the same offence under their sporting codes. Ohuruogos coach, Lloyd Cowan, was delighted with the outcome and insisted he would now do everything in his power to make her an Olympic champion. Im so pleased for her, we now just have to move on and get this cloud over our head out of the way, he said. Its not only wonderful news for Christine but for the nation as well and as her coach I will be doing everything possible to assist her to win an Olympic medal next summer. She is such a humble person, she deserves that success. Now it is a case of walking away from what happened and looking to the future. Ohuruogu was banned from all competition by UK Athletics (UKA) for a year, in accordance with IAAF rules, after missing the three drug tests. However, Ed Warner, the UKA chairman, sent a letter of support to the appeal panel stating that Ohuruogu had never failed a test. Indeed, Ohuruogu was tested only three days after the third and decisive missed test in July 2006. Her ban meant that she lost her lottery funding and was forced to take a job at Newham Council to combat 20,000 of debt. Paula Radcliffe and heptathlon star Kelly Sotherton  both outspoken in their condemnation of athletes suspected of taking drugs  have also backed Ohuruogus campaign. Dick Pound, former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency, took a similar view when he stated: If I was her lawyer, I would say doping offences are governed by the world anti-doping code. The system in which we are working says for the first offence you serve a penalty and then you can come back in. It does not call for lifetime denial of access to the Olympics.  THE TIMES, LONDON

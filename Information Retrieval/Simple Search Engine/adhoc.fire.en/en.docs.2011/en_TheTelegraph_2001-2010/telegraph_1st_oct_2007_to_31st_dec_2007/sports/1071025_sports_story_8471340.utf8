				 																																																				Toronto: World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) chief Dick Pound has claimed former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch tried to sweep doping under the carpet to protect IOC interests. Samaranch wasnt interested in the issue, Pound said. There was no money available for research and Samaranch wasnt interested in using the Olympic leverage against the international federations to make them do their job. He was never willing to do that.				 																																																				Samaranch, who took over as IOC chief in 1980, is credited with turning the then lagging fortunes of the Olympic movement around. The Spaniards reign ended in 2001 and Jacques Rogge, who has advocated a zero tolerance policy on drugs, succeeded him. 				 																																																				Sheffield: Powerhouses like Manchester United and Real Madrid, who have claimed just about every major title in club soccer, cant match the honour held by Sheffield FC  the oldest football team in the world.

We have got a claim no one else can ever have, Sheffield manager David McCarthy said. There can always be a bigger club, a richer one and a more successful one, but they cant be the first...

London: Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes will have a scan on a knee injury that forced him to miss Tuesdays Champions League win over Dynamo Kiev, the English champions said.

Zurich: Argentina have returned to the top of Fifas world rankings after winning their first two qualifying matches for the 2010 World Cup.				 																																																				The South Americans secured 2-0 victories away to Venezuela and at home to Chile earlier this month to climb above Brazil and Italy in the monthly standings.				 																																																				Italy, who topped the rankings last month, fell to third despite two wins of their own. The Italians also dropped points under the rolling system used by Fifa to evaluate national teams, with a more heavily weighted win over Ukraine in October 2006 being devalued. England have dropped out of the top 10.				 																																																				India remain at 145 on the Fifa list with 156 points, while they are at No. 25 in Asia. Japan are No. 1 in Asia and No. 30 in the world.				 																																																				TOP 10 (Previous positions in brackets)  1. (2) Argentina 1533 points; 2. (3) Brazil 1459; 3.

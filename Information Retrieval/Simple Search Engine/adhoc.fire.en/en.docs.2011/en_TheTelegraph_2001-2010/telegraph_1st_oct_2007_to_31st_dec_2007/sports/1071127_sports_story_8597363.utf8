 Disastrous start by Bagan
 - I-League
 -  Edu strikes brace for JCT; Barreto suffers fresh injury A STAFF REPORTER  Edu Ardo da Silva (left), who scored both goals for JCT, with fellow striker Sunil Chhetri and goalkeeper Karanjit Singh, after the match against Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Mohun Bagan got off to a disastrous start in their ONGC I-League campaign, going down 1-2 to JCT at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. Brazilian striker Edu Ardo da Silva scored both goals on either side of the break, demonstrating the Phagwara-based teams domination in the match. Shanmugam Venkatesh headed in a consolation goal for Mohun Bagan in the stoppage time of the match. Ten days have elapsed since Mohun Bagan beat Peerless convincingly to claim their 27th CFL title. But their journey from that euphoria to a traumatic beginning in the countrys premier club competition was as abrupt as astonishing. The strong midfield which gave coach Carlos Roberto Pereira the local title was absolutely non-existent against JCT. Douglas da Silva was Pereiras anchor in a midfield designed for containment and counter-attack. James Singh and Dharamjit Singh were the wide men and Venkatesh was supposed to play the feeders role. JCT countered it with a subtle reshuffle in the middle, using Marcos in the hole. Besides, their strategy was also to put the Mohun Bagan defence under pressure, not allowing Dharamjit Singh amp; Co. to call the shots in the beginning. A couple of Sunil Chhetri-Marcos combinations were the precursor to JCTs impending threats that Mohun Bagan defence refused to pay heed to. JCT came calling again in the 14th minute, Sanjeev Marias desperate lunge blocked Baljit Singh Sainis run near the top box. Edus free-kick was spot on, the ball beating a diving Shilton Paul and crashing into the left corner of the nets. It was 0-1 and Mohun Bagan were quickly on the counter, like wounded tigers. Jose Ramirez Barretos attempt from the edge of the box was timely intercepted by Daljit Singh. Both players lay writhing in pain as the ball went agonisingly close to the far post. Daljit had to be stretchered out of the ground and Barreto managed to endure the pain on his left leg till the first half. During this time, the Bhaichung Bhutia-Barreto pair sparkled twice, the Brazilian ruining both moves with feeble shots. The pain was clearly troubling the Brazilian and when P.C. Lalawmpuia eventually replaced him at the start of the second half, Mohun Bagan  with their midfielders still struggling to find rhythm  lost the sting in the attacking third. Pouring more salt on the home teams wounds, Edu took the match beyond them in the 76th minute. A brilliant Gurwinder through found Saini in the far end. The JCT midfielder took a powerful shot, but Shiltons timely block was not enough as Edu was lurking nearby to snap up the rebound. Douglas was clearly the weak link in the team, conceding possession to the rivals time and again. Pereira introduced Lalkamal Bhowmick in the second half, but the young midfielder was also found wanting in penetrating the rival box. With Barreto out and Bhaichung under zonal marking, Carlos yearned for a finisher. When Venkatesh provided them with the breakthrough, it bore little significance as the match lasted precisely 11 seconds after the restart.

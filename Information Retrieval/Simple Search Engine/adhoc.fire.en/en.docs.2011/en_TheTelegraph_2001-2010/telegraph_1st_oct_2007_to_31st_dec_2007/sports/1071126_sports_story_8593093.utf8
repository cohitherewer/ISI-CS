 Classic Sky justifies odds 
 STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Classic Sky, the piping hot-favourite to win the first Classic of the season, the Calcutta 1000 Guineas, had the measure of another fancied runner, Elusive Trust, on Sunday. The official verdict between the two fillies was three lengths, in spite of the fact that 3-10 favourite shifted out badly while negotiating the final turn.				 										The race was run at a moderate pace. Antonique called the shot with Elusive Trust in hot chase while Classic Sky was held back in fourth. Elusive Trust assumed the charge of running passing the 800m marker, prompting Chisty to step up the acceleration too. The jockeys hurried effort, however, forced the filly to take the circuiteous route at the home turn but the Placerville daughter braved it all.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

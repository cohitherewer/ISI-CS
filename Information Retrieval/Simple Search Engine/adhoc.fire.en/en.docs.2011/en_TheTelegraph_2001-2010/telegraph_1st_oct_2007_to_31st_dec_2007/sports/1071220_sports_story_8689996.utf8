 Alterio may be hard to beat 

 STAR RACER
				 										Calcutta: Thursdays six-event card, featuring the Reindeer Cup, may not be compared to the look of weekend fixtures. It, however, does suit the needs of the mid-week betters. 
				 										The competition is therefore going to be tough as usual, in view of heavy wagerings on the city horses in the off course centres. Nevertheless, three horses in the card  Saarah Alam, Havana and Alterio  are strongly fancied to win their respective events. 
				 										Alterio, in particular, is expected to reproduce his monsoon Derby form and lift the 1,600m feature event. In that race, the Vijay Singh-trainee was heavily fancied against the winner, Steal The Glory.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

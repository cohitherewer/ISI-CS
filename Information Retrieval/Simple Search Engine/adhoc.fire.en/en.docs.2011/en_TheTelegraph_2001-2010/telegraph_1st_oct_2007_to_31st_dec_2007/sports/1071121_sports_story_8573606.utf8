 Fit Shoaib means business
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Shoaib Akhtar plays with a soft toy during practice at the Kotla on Tuesday. (PTI) New Delhi: Shoaib Akhtar was the first to come out to the ground after the Pakistan squad arrived for nets at the Kotla on Tuesday. Even as his teammates took their time to emerge from the dressing room, the Rawalpindi Express didnt waste a minute in starting his workout. Trainer David Dwyer joined Shoaib a few minutes later, and the training continued till the fast bowler was called to nets by coach Geoff Lawson. Dwyer claimed that Shoaib was fully fit and could be Pakistans main weapon in the first Test beginning on Thursday. Shoaib has done a lot of work with me... Hes in great shape at the moment, said the Aussie trainer. In Gwalior, he bowled very fast. On a few occasions his pace was more than 150 kilometres per hour. We hope to see him bowling at great speed here too. Dwyer said it took a lot of effort to keep the quick in shape. Yes, it was not easy to make him fit, he said. We looked into his history of injuries and worked on it. You have to consider the force that goes through his body, as with other pacers too. Shoaib moved away from the nets to use an inhaler but Dwyer said it had nothing to do with any breathing problem. He uses it to clear his lungs, Dwyer said. Its just medication, nothing else. After a couple of hours at nets, Shoaib decided to entertain the fans who had gathered to get his autograph. He took a camera from a waiting photographer and zoomed in on the autograph seekers. He also posed for a shot with a policeman.

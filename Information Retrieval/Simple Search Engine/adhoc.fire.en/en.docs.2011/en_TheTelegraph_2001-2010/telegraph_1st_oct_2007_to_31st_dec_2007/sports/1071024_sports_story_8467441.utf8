 Hayden loves to thrash India
 Matthew Hayden Melbourne: Matthew Hayden derives an almost sadistic pleasure in silencing crowded stadiums in India with a match-winning knock or a brutal shot. The towering Australian opener says nothing matches the elation he gets after thrashing the Men in Blue. Hayden said India, whom they beat 4-2 in the one-day series there, have replaced England as his favourite punching bags. I think India is close on being my favourite side to beat. Theyve almost taken the No. 1 seeding off England in a lot of ways, Hayden was quoted as saying in a Sydney newspaper. Its a side that within its psyche has amazing highs and amazing lows. So it doesnt take long to realise theyre at a low when youre standing in front of 70,000 people in a stadium and you can hear a pin drop. Its a great position to be in and you know youve got them beat, he said. Our ambition is to keep their crowd as quiet as we possibly can and just play good cricket. Its not a personal thing. The hard-hitting opener said India shot themselves in the foot by pretending to match the Australians aggression, which ended up spurring Ricky Pontings men to beat them in the one-day series. I think its one of the greatest misconceptions of this side ever, that it is aggressive. I think what we are extends from our culture, it is just having a great mate-ship and camaraderie within any kind of team, Hayden said. You put any 12 blokes together and youll get a job done. Whether its getting a bogged four-wheel-drive off the beach or standing in front of a cricket wicket and making sure were in a dominant position. Its the same dog, different leg action, so to speak, he said. I think it shows an insecurity to do anything else other than that. All it really does is just amp up the intensity of the way we play our cricket. Its a good thing for us. You never want an Australian with his back up against the wall. We saw that last summer against England, youre seeing that now with this verbal jousting thats happening between India and Australia, Hayden said. On his career, Hayden said he was enjoying every bit of it and was in no mood to even think about when to call it quits. Its been a positive in terms of my career in that I dont really look too far ahead. And I dont speculate too much, I dont get a lot of momentum about whats happened in the past either. I guess for me a marker is how much Im enjoying hitting cricket balls. I can honestly say that when I pick up a bat and walk out, whether it be in the middle or in the nets, its something I still have a tremendous passion for, he said. I almost feel like its an undying passion at this stage. And until that starts to waver, I cant see myself finishing.  (PTI)

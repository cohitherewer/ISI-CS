 Sourav-beamer at Dhoni from Shah
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sourav Calcutta: Till Friday morning, handling former captains in the dressing room was seen as Mahendra Singh Dhonis biggest off-field challenge. After Board secretary Niranjan Shahs comment on Sourav Gangulys non-inclusion for the Hyderabad ODI against Australia, negotiating beamers from officials could actually be the Team India captains No.1 headache. Sourav was dropped for the match, Shah told the media on the sidelines of the third ODI. It made bigger news than Murali Kartiks comeback, after ages, for the next two matches. Indeed, with the youngsters versus oldies (at 35, Souravs the oldest in the squad) debate being fanned in certain quarters, the remark caused more than a tremor. By the evening, though, Dhoni and chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar had a very different story to tell. Its best, therefore, that officials refrain from speaking on matters which dont fall under their purview. Its for the captain/coach/chief selector to talk about the composition of the XI in a Test or ODI or a Twenty20 face-off.  Sourav has a hamstring problem He was eager to play, but we decided not to take any risk keeping in mind the rest of the matches His participation could have aggravated the problem We didnt wish to risk missing a batsman of his calibre any more, was Dhonis explanation. He didnt react to a Shah-specific question. Hardly surprising as Dhonis settling into the job and antagonising the Board secretary may not be as wise a move as utilising the slower bowlers in the World Twenty20 bowl out against Pakistan. Contacted by The Telegraph from Calcutta, Vengsarkar said much the same thing as Dhoni. Sourav did make himself available, but we decided not to take a chance He didnt play today, but is definitely going to be in the XI for the next ODI (Chandigarh, on Monday). Asked if the former captain would open there, Vengsarkar answered: Yes, but I cant say with whom. Its too early. The chief selector and not Dhoni had a one-on-one with Sourav before the XI was finalised. Sourav strained his right hamstring during the first match, in Bangalore, and didnt play in Kochi. Kept away from ODIs for 16 months during the Greg Chappell era, Sourav has had a fantastic run since his return in January  1,024 runs at an average of 51.20. As important, this period has seen the revival of Souravs partnership with Sachin Tendulkar  theirs is the most successful opening combination (20 century stands) in limited overs cricket. That the pair launched the innings in five of the last six (non-Twenty20) matches won by Team India cant be treated as insignificant. Surely, theres a lesson to be drawn.

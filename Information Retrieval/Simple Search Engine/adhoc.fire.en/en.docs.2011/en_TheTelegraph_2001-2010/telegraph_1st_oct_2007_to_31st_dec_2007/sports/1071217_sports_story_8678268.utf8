	Inzamam rsquo;s view
 
	Karachi: Former captain Inzamam-ul Haq said Geoff Lawson rsquo;s inexperience as a coach at the international level was one of the factors behind Pakistan rsquo;s poor show in India.

 ldquo; Malik is young and learning and he needs a strong support staff. Unfortunately, coach Geoff Lawson is also new to international cricket and is in a learning phase. Malik needs someone experienced to back and support him, rdquo; he said.

	Jaffer hopeful

 ldquo;In 2003-04, the openers gave tremendous starts which made it easier for the middle-order, rdquo; Jaffer said.

 ldquo;(There is) a lot of responsibility on the top-order, especially the openers. If they (middle-order) get exposed to the new ball it can get difficult, rdquo; said Jaffer.

 Atwals last chance to get act right
Lakeside (California): With the prospect of going through qualification school looming large, Arjun Atwal would have to conjure up something special in the season finale, the US $775,000 Nationwide Tour Championship, to catapult himself to the top-25 in the money list and secure his 2008 PGA Tour card. Atwal slipped from 57th to 60th place in the money list after missing the cut by two shots at Miccosukee Championship last week and barely managed to qualify for the season finale here which opens its door only for the top-60 from that list. After this event, top-25 in the money list would get their 2008 PGA Tour card, while those in 26-60 would continue on the Nationwide Tour. Atwal, who has had little ups and more downs this season, would have Hunter Haas for company and they would be the first pair to tee off on Thursday in the 72-hole. No-cut event that offers the largest first-place cheque in history, US $139,500 at the Barona Creek Golf Club.  (PTI)

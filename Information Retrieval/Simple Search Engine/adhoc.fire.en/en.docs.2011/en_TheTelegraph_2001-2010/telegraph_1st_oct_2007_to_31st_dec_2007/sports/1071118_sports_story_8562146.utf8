 Misbah: Dhoni-Yuvrajs form deciding factor
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTJaipur: Misbah-ul Haq on Friday said that Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singhs form has been the deciding factor in the one-day series. The two are in dangerous form, said the Pakistan middle-order batsman. In such form, they would win matches against any team in the world, leave alone Pakistan. We have been trying to contain them from the start of the series but havent achieved success so far. On Sunday, India are likely to rest some of their key players for the final ODI. We will try to take advantage of that, said Misbah. Change of combination does make a difference We will try to win this match. Even Sourav Gangulys absence, Misbah said, would help the visitors. He hasnt scored too many runs, but is an experienced cricketer. It will be an advantage for us if he doesnt play tomorrow. Misbah said Pakistan would not experiment with the batting order. We tried Afridi as an opener only once in the series Malik also opened once. Tomorrow we will not try anything new since the pitch looks a normal batting track, Misbah said. To say that we are too much dependent on Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan is wrong Butt is playing well. I have also contributed... The only thing is that so far I have not been able to steer the team to victory. Misbah said Pakistan were missing Shoaib Akhtar in full throttle. He is not match fit since he is playing after a long gap. But once he is back in top form, he has the ability to run through any side. India opener Gautam Gambhir said he held no grudge against Shahid Afridi after the recent on-field spat in Kanpur. We hold no grudge against each other off the field. It was a heat of the moment incident. Asked whether he was happy to see Afridi out of the Test squad, Gambhir smiled and quipped: So what? I have also been dropped from the team.

 India win a thriller
 Zaheer Khan and Murali Kartik celebrate after India beat Australia in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI) Mumbai: India pulled off an incredible two-wicket victory relying on their tailenders to salvage some pride against Australia in the final one-dayer on Wednesday. In a low-scoring thriller, India rode Murali Kartiks career-best six for 27 to bundle out Australia for a paltry 193 in 41.3 overs. The hosts then staged a dramatic recovery to overhaul the target with four overs to spare. Australia won the series 4-2. The Indians owed their remarkable victory to left-arm spinner Kartik, who produced a mesmerising spell to derail the Australian batting and then was involved in a 52-run unbeaten partnership with Zaheer Khan (31 not out). The Australians had the Indians tottering at 64 for 6 and it seemed only a matter of time for the inevitable but the game took a dramatic turn when Robin Uthappa (47) led the recovery. Kartiks career-best haul and unbeaten 21 runs earned him the Man of the Match award. The seventh wicket pair added 65 runs in 13.1 overs to take the score past the 100-run mark. After Uthappa was out at 129 and Harbhajan Singh (19) on 143, Zaheer and Kartik steered them home with an unbroken half-century stand for the ninth wicket. The determined fight back by the lower-order batsmen came after the Australian bowlers ran through the top-order. The cheap dismissals of Sourav Ganguly and Dinesh Karthik, who replaced the out-of-form Rahul Dravid in the playing XI, for ducks within the first four overs by Mitchell Johnson set the tone for yet another batting collapse. Both Sourav and Karthik perished by edging Johnson to Adam Gilchrist. Yuvraj Singh (15) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (5) didnt last long. In between, Sachin Tendulkar (21) perished dragging Brett Lee on to his stumps. Irfan Pathan followed a run later before Uthappa and Harbhajan showed defiance to take the total past the 100-mark. The end looked near after the pair departed but Zaheer and Kartik had other ideas. The meek capitulation by the top order nearly laid to waste a superb spell of slow bowling by Kartik who destroyed the high-flying Australian batting with magical figures of six for 27, during which he was on a hattrick twice. Kartik, who grabbed two wickets off successive balls on two occasions, brought back memories of a similar display against the same opposition in a Test almost three years ago. After being denied a hattrick in the first ball of his third over, Kartik struck three big blows in his eighth over, off the first, fourth and fifth balls, to get rid off Brad Haddin (19), Brad Hogg and Lee.

 Llodra reveals offer of 2003
 Michael Llodra Paris: Wimbledon doubles champion Michael Llodra fuelled the debate on alleged match-fixing in tennis by saying on Tuesday he had been asked to throw a match four years ago. I was in my hotel room and somebody called to ask me not to try too hard the next day, Llodra told French radio. That was four years ago. I said no and hung up. Now, with what has happened since, I think maybe be I was one of the first players to have been approached. Llodra won this years Wimbledon title with fellow-Frenchman Arnaud Clement, a former top 10 singles player who said on Monday he had been approached to throw a match. We have the feeling that a lot of people have been approached, theres a lot of talk about it on the circuit, Llodra said. Wherever there is money, you have crooks. Its difficult to stop because there is a powerful ring behind it. The threat of possible match-fixing was being taken very seriously at this weeks Paris Masters tournament, the French Tennis Federation (FFT) said. Betting on matches was being watched for anything suspicious, said FFT general director Jean-Francois Vilotte. Matches were also being recorded and analysed by former players and ATP supervisors while players were banned from betting at the venue, he added.  (REUTERS)

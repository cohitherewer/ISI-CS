New Delhi: Akshay Kumar Mall scored a brace as India thrashed Bhutan 4-0 in their last group C match to qualify for the AFC Under-16 Football Championship in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. The Indians led 2-0 at halftime through goals by Aashish Chettri and Abhishek Das before Mall struck twice  in the 68th and 83rd minute  to round off Indias brilliant campaign last night, which saw them qualify for the main event to be held next year. The comprehensive win at the Prince Mohammed bin Fahad Stadium left India second in the group with 13 points. Chart leaders Iraq also finished with 13 points but led the tally with a better goal average (for 28, against 2). India won four matches and held Iraq to a 2-2 draw. The Indians first routed Sri Lanka 6-0 before the draw with Iraq. They then defeated Lebanon and hosts Saudi Arabia with identical margins of 3-0 before last nights triumph against Bhutan.  (PTI)

 Yousuf climbs 10 spots
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Pakistan batsman Mohammed Yousuf jumped 10 places to storm into the top 10 of the LG ICC player rankings for ODI batsmen. Yousuf won the Player-of-the-Series award after scores of 53, 117, 58, 5 and 53. However his efforts were not enough to prevent South Africa from clinching the series 3-2. With Pakistan scheduled to play five ODIs against India next month, Yousuf (723 rating points) will be aiming to continue his upward progress. South Africa captain Graeme Smith climbed two places to fourth, stated an ICC release on Tuesday. However there was some bad news for Indian batsmen, as Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni dropped places. While Sachin fell from ninth to tenth place, Yuvraj lost two places to be 17th. Team India captain dropped one place to 18th. ODI RANKINGS BATSMEN  1. Ricky Ponting (Aus; 788 points); 2.

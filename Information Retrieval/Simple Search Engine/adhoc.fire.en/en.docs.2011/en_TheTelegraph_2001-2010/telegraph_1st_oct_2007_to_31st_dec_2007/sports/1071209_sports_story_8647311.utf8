Bangalore: Pakistans pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtars tryst with injuries continued in the final Test too. 
Out bowling at the Chinnaswamy on Saturday, the Rawalpindi Express was forced to go to the hospital  for the second time in this series. 
An MRI was done after he complained of back spasm soon after lunch. 
Although medical examinations didnt reveal anything serious, the fast bowler was ruled out of almost two sessions on Day I, dealing a severe blow to Pakistans progress. 
Shoaibs MRI didnt reveal anything serious but he was still complaining of stiffness in the back. Hes been advised a days rest and his availability will be reassessed on Sunday morning, a Pakistan team spokesperson said on Saturday. 
Shoaib managed just 10 overs halfway through Day I, conceding 23 runs without success. 
The temperamental fast bowler was also admitted to a hospital in Calcutta owing to a chest infection ahead of the second Test. He eventually made the XI but looked in distinct discomfort throughout the Eden Test. 
At the Chinnaswamy, Shoaib bowled four overs in his first spell before going off the field at the end of the seventh over. He came back after Gautam Gambhir was dismissed in over No. 8, but once again returned to the pavilion having bowled the next over. 
He bowled eight overs before lunch and managed two more after the break before leaving the field once again, this time, though, for an MRI.

 Manju injury adds to Mohun Bagan woes EB on top 
 As if the uncertainty over Jose Ramirez Barreto was not enough, there was further cause for worry in the Mohun Bagan camp in the build-up to their I-League opener next week. N.S. Manju, a dependable defender, aggravated a groin injury during practice on Wednesday. The same problem had kept Manju on the sidelines of Indias World Cup qualifiers against Lebanon. There are five days to go for Mohun Bagans first match, against JCT. But coach Carlos Roberto Pereira seemed to be mentally preparing for a game without Manju and Barreto. We cant say for sure whether they can play but we have to be ready for all situations, the Brazilian said. Barreto, too, is nursing a groin injury which he suffered during the last CFL Premier Division match against Mohammedan Sporting on Sunday. The Brazilian, who top-scored with 14 goals, sat on the sidelines as his teammates worked out. There will be no official word on the duos participation till the weekend, but the body language of both suggested that neither will be in a position to take the field versus JCT. The I-League is set to kick off in Margao with the Dempo-Salgaocar on Saturday. The first edition will feature 10 teams but the federation and its broadcast partner ZEE Sports are looking to increase the number of clubs in the future. There will be two clubs relegated and four promoted from the second division each season and after three years, we aim to have a top division of 16 teams so that most of the country is represented, an official said.

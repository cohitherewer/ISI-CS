 Md. Sp. beat E. Rly 2-0 
A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting notched up their fourth win in the CFL Premier Division beating Eastern Railway 2-0 at Bararsat on Thursday. Adewusi Adebayo and K. Kulothungan scored for Shabbir Alis team but the win didnt alter their position in the standings. Mohammedan Sporting are rooted in the fifth place with 16 points from 13 matches while Eastern Railway remain bottom-placed with just 9 points. Mohammedan Sporting took the lead in the 38th minute when Adebayos free-kick on the edge of the rival box was spot-on. Kulothungan made it 2-0 in the 63rd minute. He received a pass from Adebayo from the right and came up with a quick shot which gave Eastern Railway keeper Tapan Karmakar no chance. Mike Okoros injury, however, remained a concern for Ali ahead of their final round clash with champions Mohun Bagan on Sunday. Okoro left the ground after being injured during a collision with Bapan Bera. TEAMS Mohammedan Sporting: Naseem Akhtar; Sebi Martins, Sk. Azim, Subhas Mondal, Prem Kumar, Mir Farooq Haider, Adewusi Adebayo, Prasanta Chakraborty, Munir K.P. (Nirapada Mondal, 39m), K. Kulothungan, Mike Okoro (Raman Vijayan, 29m). Eastern Railway: Tapan Karmarkar; Babun Kar, Santanu Bit, Subhankar Maity, Dipankar Ghosh, Niladri Chakraborty, Parvez Alam, Bapan Bera, Antony Soren, Bapi Haldar, Benjamin. Referee: Debashish Mishra.

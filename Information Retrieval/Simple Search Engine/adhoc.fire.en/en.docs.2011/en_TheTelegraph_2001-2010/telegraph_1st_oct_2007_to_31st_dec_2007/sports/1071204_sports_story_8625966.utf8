 Enough time to force a win: Dhoni
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhoni feels India have enough time to force a win in the second Test. The following are excerpts from the Twenty20 and ODI captains media conference on Monday: Q What will be Indias game plan on the final day? A Well bat a bit more tomorrow Cant say exactly how many runs we need. Its not just a matter of runs. It depends on the time as well. How is the wicket playing? The wicket is responding to a bit to spin. On the fourth and fifth days the game changes very quickly in India. Its possible many wickets will fall in a hurry At times you may not get a single wicket in a whole session Its uncertain. How difficult will it be for the batsmen? It will be difficult to bat When theyre bowling in the rough you never know how much its going to turn or bounce and when the field is set defensively its tough to score quickly. Its hard to go out there and look for sixes or fours. Is the wicket breaking up? Its not breaking up, its powder right now. If they bowl in the right areas its going to be tough for batsmen... Wicket to wicket its not scuffed up so the spinners will definitely have to use the rough. The pitch is very slow and after the ball becomes soft its tough to pierce the infield. Is there enough turn? The turn is not really quick, but if you can bowl in the rough it is turning and the bounce is not consistent. Some balls are turning more, some are turning less, to thats a plus for us. Do we have enough time to force a win? Frankly speaking we need only 10 balls to win the match now. So in a way five hours is too much time. We have to beat them in flight or with turn and bounce. What sort of target are you looking to set? Its not about the total. To win this match you need ten wickets. So the score is not that relevant. But to be on the safer side, on a wicket like this, youd love to have fielders surrounding the bat. To have those extra couple of fielders close-in you need to have those extra runs. Then you can really attack and challenge the batsmen to play some shots on a fifth-day wicket.

 Wait a year: Greg
New Delhi: Former Team India coach Greg Chappell feels Mahendra Singh Dhoni, front-runner to become the Test captain after Sachin Tendulkar turned down the offer, needs at least another year to be ready for the responsibility. Chappell said Dhoni was still learning the nuances of the job by leading in ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals and would be ready for Test captaincy in next 12 months. He (Dhoni) is doing his apprenticeship in the limited-over formats of the game. Probably another 12 months or more before he is perhaps ready for all three of them, he told a TV channel on Tuesday. The 26-year-old Dhoni has been impressive in his captaincy in the Twenty20 and ODIs but the selectors did not want to overburden him. They preferred Sachin Tendulkar after Rahul Dravid quit to focus on his batting. Tendulkar led India twice earlier without much success, winning just four of 25 Tests before stepping down to concentrate on his batting. Dhoni, who led a young team to title in the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa, was appointed captain for 12 ODIs till the ongoing five-match series against Pakistan. The ODIs will be followed by three Tests against Pakistan before the tour of Australia for a four-Test series.  (AGENCIES)

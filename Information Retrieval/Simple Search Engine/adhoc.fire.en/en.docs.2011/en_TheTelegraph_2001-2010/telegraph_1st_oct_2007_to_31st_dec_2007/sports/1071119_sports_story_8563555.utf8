 Kapur let down by poor start
 Miguel Angel Jimenez with the trophy after winning the Hong Kong Open on Sunday. (AFP) Hong Kong: A poor front nine spoilt Shiv Kapurs chances of finishing inside the top five as he carded his weeks worst of two-over 72 to end tied 12th but Daniel Chopra returned a steady 70 to hold on to his overnight tied seventh position in the $2.25m Hong Kong Open here on Sunday. Kapur, who was tied third on Saturday, signed off with a total of nine-under 271. Chopra, on the other hand, finished a stroke above Kapur at the par-70 Hong Kong Golf Club. Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez turned in a fine three-under 67, which also included a 13th hole eagle, to claim the title by one stroke. Jimenez, who was second after the penultimate round, totalled 15-under 265 to finish ahead of Korean K. J. Choi (67), Thai Thongchai Jaidee (65) and overnight leader Swede Robert Karlsson, who turned in a poor two-over 72. Among other Indians in the fray, Calcutta pro S. S. P. Chowrasia improved to tied 32nd spot after a final-round 70 to finish with a total of four-under 276. Rahil Gangjee had a disappointing day as he carded a five-over 75 to end with a total of three-over 283. Gangjees nightmarish round comprised three double bogeys and a bogey against three birdies.

 Pak need 349, SA nine wickets
Lahore: Pakistan were 108 for one at close of play on the fourth day of the second Test, chasing an improbable victory target of 457 after centuries from South Africa captain Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis. At the crease, Kamran Akmal was on 49 and Younis Khan had made 48 as Pakistan fought hard after the early loss of opener, Salman Butt for six. It is not going to be easy out there if we get a few things right, the South Africa skipper Smith told reporters. They have to score at four runs an over and on the last day where the ball is really turning and doing some reverse swing, it is going to be very difficult for them. South Africa declared on 305 for four at tea leaving Kallis unbeaten on 107 for his third century of the series. He enjoyed a third-wicket stand of 207 from 431 balls with Smith (133), who scored his first hundred in 17 tests and first on the subcontinent. The partnership was broken in the second session after Pakistan took the second new ball and spinner Danish Kaneria finally got Smith to miscue a sweep to point. He had batted for 407 minutes, faced 296 balls and hit 17 fours. Resuming at the overnight 154 for two, Smith and Kallis scored at a slow pace and added only 57 more runs in the first session before scoring a speedy 94 runs in a second session. Beginning their second innings after tea, Pakistan lost Butt in the sixth over when substitute Shaun Pollock took a smart catch at third slip off Makhaya Ntinis bowling. But on a pitch, which is playing up and down, Younis and wicketkeeper Akmal fought back with some courageous batting. (Agencies)

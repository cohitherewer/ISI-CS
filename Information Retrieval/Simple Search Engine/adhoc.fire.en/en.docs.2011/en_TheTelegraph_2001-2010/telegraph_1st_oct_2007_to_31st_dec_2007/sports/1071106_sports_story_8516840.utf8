 Bhutia ready for challenge
A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia thinks Mohun Bagan have the resources to endure the pressure of being on top of the table, going into Tuesdays crucial tie against East Bengal. Pressure will always be there when you are on top. We know that a win on Tuesday will help us get close to the title and we are in fine nick to face up to the challenge, the ace striker said. He also hoped the arch-rivals would produce another crackajack performance with Mohun Bagan having the last laugh once again. I was not part of the 4-3 win in the first leg due to my national camp duty. Im looking forward to another thriller with the result going in our favour, said India captain, also leading for the first time in a derby in Calcutta. Describing the Federation Cup debacle as history, Bhaichung added: What has happened in the past has little relevance to the derby. More than my leadership, we need a fighter in everybody. Apart from Deepak Mondal, everybody is fit and raring to go.

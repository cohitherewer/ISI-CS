 Paes, Damm in Masters semis
Shanghai: World number two Rafael Nadal blasted past Serb Novak Djokovic 6-4, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals of the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup Thursday. Meanwhile, in the mens doubles round robin (Gold Group), Leander Paes and Martin Damm went down to Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyett 3-6, 4-6. Despite the loss, the Indo-Czech pair join Hanley and Ullyett in the semi-finals. In another doubles match, Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi pipped J Erlich and Andy Ram 6-4, 3-6, 10-7. The French Open champion sank to his knees in celebration but still faced a nervous wait before his place in the last four was assured. Nadals fellow Spaniard David Ferrer guaranteed his close friend would join him in the knockout stages by pulverising Frenchman Richard Gasquet 6-1, 6-1. American Andy Roddick became the first man to reach the semi, while world No.1 Roger Federer is favourite to claim the final spot on Friday. An inspired Ferrer finished on a perfect 3-0 round-robin record with Nadal going through as runner-up in their group on 2-1 having lost to his compatriot earlier this week. I played a complete match  one of my best matches of the indoor season, Nadal told reporters. Djokovic, already eliminated after losing his first two matches, failed to consistently threaten Nadal. A lucky net cord gave Nadal an early break and Djokovic effectively surrendered the set when he dumped an easy volley into the net to drop serve again in the fifth game. (Reuters)

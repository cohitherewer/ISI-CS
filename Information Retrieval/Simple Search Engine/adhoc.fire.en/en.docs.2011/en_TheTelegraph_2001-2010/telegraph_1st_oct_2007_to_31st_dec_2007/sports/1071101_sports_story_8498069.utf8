 Boxer Lakra claims Beijing berth
Chicago: A.L. Lakra became the first Indian boxer to qualify for next year rsquo;s Beijing Olympics when he defeated European silver-medallist Shahin Imranov to make the quarter finals of the world championships here. The Commonwealth champion beat Azerbaijan rsquo;s Imranov 15-9 in the pre-quarter finals of the featherweight category at the University of Chicago rsquo;s UIC pavilion to make the cut for Beijing. Lakra next faces Chinese Yang Li, who defeated Brazilian Davi Souza of Brazil 13-4.
 Indian coach Gurbaksh Singh Sandhu was all praise for the Services boxer and hoped that the remaining Indians in the fray mdash; Jitender (51 kg) and Jai Bhagwan (60 kg) mdash; would also make the cut. ldquo;This is a fine achievement. We are all very proud of what Lakra has done. I am confident about Jitender and Bhagwan as well hellip; Hopefully they will also advance to the quarters, rdquo; Sandhu said. It was a dominating performance by the Indian, who quickly opened up a two-point lead before extending it to four by the end of the third round. Lakra garnered four more points against Imranov rsquo;s two in the final round. (PTI)

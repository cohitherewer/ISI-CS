 Cristiano wins it for United, Getafe stun Barcelona 
 Cristiano Ronaldo (right) celebrates Uniteds win with Owen Hargreaves at Old Trafford on Sunday. (Reuters) London: Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in two minutes on Sunday to send Manchester United three points clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League after a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers. With unbeaten Arsenal playing at Reading on Monday, the champions were in rampant form at Old Trafford with Ronaldo heading home in the 34th minute and doubling his tally with a right-footed shot in the 36th. Blackburn, managed by former United regular Mark Hughes, had David Dunn sent off for a second yellow card in the 53rd minute. The first league fixture of Alex Fergusons 22nd year as manager left United alone on 30 points from 13 matches to Arsenals 27 from 11. Chelsea moved up to third place on 25 points after a 1-1 draw at home to Everton. Chelsea had all three points in the bag until a brilliant overhead kick by Tim Cahill in the 89th minute left goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, standing in for the injured Petr Cech, with no chance. Didier Drogba had put Chelsea in front in the 70th minute when he nodded in at the near post off a corner by Ivory Coast compatriot and substitute Salomon Kalou. Liverpool, who beat Fulham 2-0 in one of just three matches played on Saturday, slipped back to fifth place. Substitute Fernando Torres struck from close range in the 81st minute, while Steven Gerrard converted a penalty four minutes later to give manager Rafa Benitez victory in his 200th match in charge. Tottenham Hotspur were Sundays high scorers, thrashing Wigan Athletic 4-0 with Jermaine Jenas netting twice. In the days early match, Gabriel Agbonlahor cleared off the line and then scored a late winner two minutes later to give Aston Villa a 2-1 victory in the West Midlands derby at Birmingham City. In the Primera Liga Saturday, Getafe returned to haunt Barcelona as they condemned Frank Rijkaards side to a 0-2 defeat. The last time Barcelona visited the Coliseum six months ago, Getafe knocked them out of the Kings Cup in the semi-finals by overturning a 2-5 first-leg deficit with a stunning 4-0 win. This time the modest Madrid-based club put in a similarly gritty performance with Manuel del Moral giving them the lead after 28 minutes. Uruguayan Juan Albin made sure of a deserved three points with a second goal at the end. Michael Laudrups Getafe climbed to 11th with their third consecutive win.  (REUTERS)

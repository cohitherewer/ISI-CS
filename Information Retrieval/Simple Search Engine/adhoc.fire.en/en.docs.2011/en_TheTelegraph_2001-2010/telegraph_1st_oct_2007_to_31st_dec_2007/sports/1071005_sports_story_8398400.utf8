 Longer gap wouldve been better: Lalchand Rajput
 - No problem in adjusting from Twenty20 to ODIs, says cricket manager INDRANIL MAJUMDAR Lalchand Rajput Hyderabad: Lalchand Rajput was of the opinion that there should have been a longer gap between the World Twenty20 meet and the ODI series versus Australia. The cricket manager didnt, however, subscribe to the theory that the Indians failed to adjust to the 50 overs-a-side game after their success in the shortest format. Its not that there has been a problem in adjustment Most of the players are experienced and know their job well. Its just that there wasnt much time between the two engagements. A little more than a weeks break would have been ideal. It would have helped us plan better. Despite being 0-1 down, we will come back hard, Rajput told The Telegraph on Thursday. India beat Pakistan in the Twenty20 final in Johannesburg on September 24 and started the ongoing series against Australia on September 29. Some of the players have been playing for three and a half months at a stretch Players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni and RP Singh havent gone home during this period, he added. The Kochi battering notwithstanding, Team India got much success in the last few months and Rajput felt the idea of having Indians as cricket managers played a significant role. To a certain extent it helps to have an Indian in the role of cricket manager. He understands the culture of our boys and knows what suits them best. It helps in helping the side gel. Having Venkatesh Prasad and Robin Singh as bowling and fielding coaches also helped a lot. The Indians have been without a full-fledged coach since Greg Chappell decided not to have his contract renewed after the World Cup. Ravi Shastri was cricket manager on the tour of Bangladesh, followed by Chandu Borde (Ireland, Scotland and England) and now Rajput. The former Test opener didnt want to take credit for the great show in South Africa. The players should take all the credit for the way they responded to the challenge It was fabulous. Did he believe that Twenty20 was more of a captains game? Of course, its a captains game. He has to take the decisions on the spot and theres no time to rethink. Youve got to be very, very alert and keep options open. So how did he view his role in that format? A lot of planning went into every game. We would all sit and chalk out various plans Plans A, B and C would be kept ready and the captain would have to execute them as and when he felt it necessary. Rajput was all praise for Dhoni. He was so composed and calm even in difficult times He was open to views and ideas. We would discuss strategies during the break and he always stayed involved. Rajput was keeping fingers crossed on the future. I am just concentrating on my job. The rest is not in my hands.

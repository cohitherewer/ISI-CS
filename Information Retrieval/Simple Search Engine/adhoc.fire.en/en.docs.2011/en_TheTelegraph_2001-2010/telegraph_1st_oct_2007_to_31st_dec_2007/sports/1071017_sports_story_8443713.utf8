 India finish without medal
Yerevan: Women Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika failed to make a comeback and suffered her third defeat on the trot, bowing to Melia Salome of Georgia in the 13th and final round of the World Junior Girls Chess Championship here on Tuesday. Harika, who was in sole lead after 10 rounds, could not handle the pressure in the final round too and went down which meant Indian contingent returned empty handed. It was not surprising that other Indians were also out of the medal bracket as Harika was best Indian hope with her high rating in the premier girls event. Harika had to be content with fifth place on 8.5 points as Vera Nebolsina (10) won the gold ahead of Jolanta Zawadzka (9.5) of Poland and Salome (9.5) who finished second and third, respectively. In the World Juniors for boys, which was staged simultaneously, worlds youngest Grandmaster Parimarjan Negi ended on a positive note defeating higher-ranked gm Evgeny Romanov of Russia. Negi ended as the best performing Indian on 8.5 points and finished eighth. Grandmaster Adly Ahmed became the first Egyptian ever to win the World Junior Championship crown with a final round win against Georg Meier of Germany. Among the Indian girls, Eesha Karavade defeated compatriot Mary Ann Gomes. Soumya Swaminathan ended her campaign on 8.5 points after a fine effort against Mongontuul Bathuyag of Mongolia while P.

 Indian duo to donate for Don museum 

Melbourne: The Don Bradman Museum is all set to get richer in terms of Indian collections with Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly deciding to donate their memorable apparels to it. 
Sachin will give a pullover that he wore while scoring his 30th Test hundred at Headingley, overtaking Don Bradmans record of 29 centuries to the Adelaide-based museum named after the Australian legend. 
Yes, they (museum authorities) wrote to me sometime back and I have decided to donate it when I am there in Adelaide for the final Test, said Tendulkar at the end of the first days play against Victoria at Junction Oval here on Thursday. 
Apart from Sachin, Sourav will also gift his shirt that he wore during the epic Test win over Australia in the second Test in Calcutta in 2001. 
The Calcutta-Test was made unforgettable by V. V. S. Laxman, who stroked a masterly 281, and his 300-plus stand with Rahul Dravid. 
The duo batted out the fourth day to turn the game on its head and lead India to an epic win after the hosts had been asked to follow on. 
India went on to beat the Aussies 2-1 after clinching the third Test in Chennai.

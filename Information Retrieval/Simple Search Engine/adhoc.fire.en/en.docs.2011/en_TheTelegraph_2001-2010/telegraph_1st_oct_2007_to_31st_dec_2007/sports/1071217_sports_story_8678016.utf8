 Greig: India should have left earlier 

New Delhi: Former England captain Tony Greig feels the Indian team has made a mistake by leaving late for the Australia tour and predicted that the visiting batsmen would struggle on bouncy wickets as they have little time to acclimatise. 
I was very disappointed to hear that the Indians have decided to leave so late for Australia. I think thats a mistake, Greig said. 
You really need to go to Australia and give yourself a bit of time to acclimatise. 
And I worry that they havent had enough time to acclimatise. 
That being the case, if youve got bouncy pitches then you could run into a few problems, he said. 
The Indians are scheduled to leave for Australia on Monday, nine days before the first Test in Melbourne from December 26. 
Echoing him, former Australia player Dean Jones said the Indians should have given themselves at least two and a half weeks to get used to the Australian conditions.

 Jyoti, Ghei share 22nd place 
Shanghai: European Tour regular Jyoti Randhawa started his campaign with a sedate two-under 70 to join his World Cup partner and compatriot Gaurav Ghei at the 22nd place after the opening round in the $ 5m HSBC Champions here on Thursday. Randhawa played solid golf, mixing four birdies and two bogeys in his opening round to join the group of 11 players sharing the 22nd slot. Ghei returned an identical round but had more elements of drama in it. Dropping a shot in the opening hole was not the perfect start and he bogeyed the eighth too, but the veteran of many a battle birdied the fifth and seventh to take the turn at even-par before heading for a productive back stretch. On his way back, Ghei bogeyed the 12th and 17th but reeled off birdies in the 11th,15th and 16th before signing off in style, picking up a shot for his round of 70. Meanwhile, Swedish Niclas Fasth and American Kevin Stadler fired matching eight-under 64s for the joint opening round lead, three strokes ahead of Fijian Vijai Singh who carded a 67 at the Sheshan International Golf Club.

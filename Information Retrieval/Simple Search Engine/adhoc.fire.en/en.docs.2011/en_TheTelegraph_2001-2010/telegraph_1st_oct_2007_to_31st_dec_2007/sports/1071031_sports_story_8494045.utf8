 Houghton rues miss 
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Bob Houghton was shocked. He just could not accept Tuesdays 2-2 result with Lebanon in Margao, which ended Indias World Cup qualifying campaign. We could have won the match, rued the Indian coach. A couple of factors went against us, he said. His team, Houghton felt, had a good chance of achieving the 3-0 target after leading 1-0 at half time. The miss by (N.P.) Pradeep after half time cost us dear. It was the turning point of the match, he said. Pradeep received a cross from Steven Dias and had only the Lebanese goalkeeper to beat. The Mahindra United midfielder, who scored a memorable winner in the Nehru Cup final, failed to control the ball. It hit his thigh and rolled out of danger. To add to Indias woes, keeper Subrata Paul was sent off in the 71st minute for a foul on striker El Ali inside the area. Mohammed Ghaddar struck from the resultant penalty. The penalty changed everything for us, Houghton said. Once Subrata was red-carded, all our substitutions were forced ones. We couldnt make any attacking substitution. Both Climax (Lawrence) and Samir (Naik) had to be taken off because of injuries. Subrata said he was left with no option but to commit the foul as the defence-splitting pass by Mohammed Ghaddar tore open the Indian defence and Ali was all set to score. The referee could have shown a yellow card only, he said. Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia supported the goalkeepers claim. Houghton refused to comment on the red card. Good that we didnt end up losing the match after being reduced to 10 men. The Indian coach had a word of praise for midfielder Steven Dias. He played well, his crosses were very good. Pity we didnt have enough men in the opponents area to take advantage. The boys played really well in the first half. We created so many chances. Houghton is still upset with the way the AFC has changed the qualifying format. The World Cup is three years away and 23 Asian teams are out of it after playing just one match. Tonight we have to drown ourselves in sorrow, was Houghtons parting remark.

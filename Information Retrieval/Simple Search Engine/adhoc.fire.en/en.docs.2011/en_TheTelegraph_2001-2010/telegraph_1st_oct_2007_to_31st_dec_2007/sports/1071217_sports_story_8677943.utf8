 Gallas keeps Arsenal on top

London: Arsenal beat Chelsea for the first time in three years Sunday, winning 1-0 and maintaining their narrow lead at the top the Premier League. 
William Gallas headed in a corner from Cesc Fabregas in first-half injury-time at Emirates Stadium to keep Arsenal one point ahead of Manchester United, who beat Liverpool 1-0. 
Gallas, the Arsenal captain, had spent five seasons at Chelsea before he switched clubs in August 2006. Gallas also scored the last-minute equalizer in Arsenals 2-2 draw with Manchester United last month. 
It was a tough game, locked in the first half, open in the second and one where we should have scored a second goal, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. Our defence was outstanding today. Not only did they keep a clean sheet but they scored the goal as well. Overall I felt it was a great football game. 
It was Arsenals first win in 11 games against Chelsea in all competitions, including the 2004 Champions League quarter finals. 
Arsenals previous win was a 2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League in February 2004. 
Both league matches between the London rivals last season were 1-1 draws, and Chelsea beat Arsenal in the League Cup final. 
The rivalry contributed to some heated tackles throughout the match, with a minor shoving match between players in the 30th minute after John Terrys challenge on Fabregas. There was another scuffle at the end and five players from each side were shown yellow cards. 
Terry came off in the 40th with an ankle injury after a tackle from Emmanuel Eboue. 
We will know tomorrow, hes not feeling so good, Chelsea manager Avram Grant said. I think he didnt break anything but maybe (damaged) the ligament. 
In a frantic final 15 minutes, both Arsenal substitute Robin van Persie and Emmanuel Adebayor had the ball in the Chelsea net, but one goal was disallowed for offside and the other for a foul. 
Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia pushed a shot from Andriy Shevchenko over the bar, and Chelsea counterpart Petr Cech made close-range saves from Van Persie and Fabregas. 
Chelsea midfielder Shaun Wright-Phillips also missed a chance from up close. 
The visitors pushed for an equaliser in the second half. Wright-Phillips had a shot across goal in the 60th, and a minute later Almunia dived to his right to save from Jon Obi Mikel. 
Grant then bolstered his attack with another striker, Claudio Pizarro, who went on for defensive midfielder Claude Makelele. 
As the fierce play continued, Eboue was carried off on a stretcher in the 70th after a challenge by Joe Cole. Wenger said Eboue strained knee ligaments. 
Van Persie was sent on as his replacement and the striker soon forced Cech to save a shot before sending another ball over the bar. 
Chelsea defender Ashley Cole, who had been with Arsenal for eight years before switching to the Blues last August, was jeered every time he touched the ball in his first match against his former club. 
They made a lot of fouls on him, but hes a big boy, Grant said. This was not a problem. 
Arsenals other matches against the Big Four this season were a 1-1 draw with Liverpool and the draw with United. Chelsea lost at Manchester United 0-2 in September in Avram Grants first match in charge and also drew 1-1 with Liverpool in August. 
We deserved a goal but we lost the game, Grant said. We had chances to make it 1-1 and who knows at 1-1 because in the second half we played better. 
In the last 10 minutes we left counterattacks because we had to go with a lot of players forward. We deserved more but we lost the game so we are looking forward. 
Chelsea was without injured striker Didier Drogba and midfielder Michael Essien, who was suspended. 
Arsenal has missed their first-choice midfield in recent matches, but Fabregas, Mathieu Flamini and Aleksandr Hleb all started Sunday. (AP)

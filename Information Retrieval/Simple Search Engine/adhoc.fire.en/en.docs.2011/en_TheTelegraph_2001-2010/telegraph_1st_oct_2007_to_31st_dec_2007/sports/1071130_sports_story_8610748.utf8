 Pak at wits end to field fit players
 - It wont surprise if Shoaib plays today; Same India XI likely INDRANIL MAJUMDAR Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik tends to his injured ankle. (AFP) Calcutta: Everything about this Pakistan team is fluid and unstable. Be it form or fitness, everything seems to be undergoing prodigious changes on this tour. And no one seems to have any control over the circumstances. A team which is one down in the series is struggling to put up 11 fit players for the second Test. Captain Shoaib Malik, who has been nursing a troubled ankle, is still limping and feeling the pain. It is highly unlikely that he will lead the side on Friday. Vice-captain Younis Khan will step in if Malik fails to make it. The last time he did so against India was in Karachi 2006 and Pakistan won handsomely. The update on Shoaib Akhtar is not encouraging either. He did not venture out of his hotel room on Thursday. Hes recovering Lets see how he shapes up, is the official version. The weakness, following a viral fever, still persists, but Shoaib might just spring a surprise on the morning of the Test. An appearance, no doubt, will boost the teams sagging morale. Such miracles often turn the tide in the underdogs favour. Pakistan suffered a fresh blow when the team management decided to send back Umar Gul. The fast bowler, who missed the first Test with a back strain, looked fine on Wednesday but broke down again. He woke up with a stiff back and the pain forced them not to take any chance. Mohammed Sami is the latest to have contracted an infection and fingers are crossed on his participation. Misbah-ul Haqs recovery has been the only bright spot. As things stand, only Sohail Tanveer and Danish Kaneria are available among the first-choice bowlers. Yasir Arafat received an SOS, but will only reach the city early on Friday morning from Dubai. Whether the allrounder, who performed well for Kent in the County Championship this season, will feature in the XI is anybodys guess. There was a move to fly in Rao Iftikhar Anjum, who played the one-dayers, but his visa couldnt be arranged in such a short time. The Indians are not reading much into the Pakistanis problems. The focus is on making the most of the opportunities and sealing the series here itself. Anil Kumble said as much at the match-eve media conference. The pitch has been to the Indians liking and they are likely to retain the XI that played in the first Test. The cracks on the newly-laid wicket are likely to widen as the match progresses. The ball may turn more than it usually does at the Eden. The captain calling correctly should be batting first. The first session, as always, will hold the key as the early start and the moisture will help the ball move around. The Indians have many fond memories from the last time they played here against Pakistan. Kumble and Harbhajan Singh had rocked their boat in the second innings and Rahul Dravid scored centuries in both innings as India won comfortably. Perhaps Kumble could inspire a series-winning show from his men this time. TEAMS India (likely): Wasim Jaffer, Dinesh Karthik, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel Pakistan (from): Salman Butt, Yasir Hameed, Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf, Misbah-ul Haq, Shoaib Malik, Yasir Arafat, Faisal Iqbal, Kamran Akmal, Sohail Tanveer, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami, Danish Kaneria, Abdur Rehman Umpires: Rudi Koertzen, Billy Doctrove.

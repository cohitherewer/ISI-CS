 Hamilton decides to leave England
TIMES ONLINE AMP; AGENCIES Lewis Hamilton Lewis Hamilton has confirmed he is quitting England for Switzerland after revealing he is fed up with the intrusion into his private life. The 22-year-old Formula One world championship runner-up, who missed out on being the youngest driver and first rookie to claim the title by just one point last season, revealed his decision 24 hours after his home town of Stevenage announced the naming of a street after him. Ive decided to move to Switzerland, Hamilton said. You lose your ability to go to places. You really struggle to live a normal life. Its been a really tough year. Ive not been able to spend a lot of time with my friends, my family. You come home and everyone knows you, it makes it so much harder to do normal things. I cant go to the cinema. I go to the bathroom in a petrol station and people come in there for autographs. Its tough but I knew that was going to be the case. Of Switzerland, a tax haven, he said: People don;t come up to you. They leave you, they give you your space. Hamilton has also accused F1 authorities of treating McLaren unfairly last season, claiming his team must be whiter than white next year if they are to steer clear of trouble. This year saw McLaren fined almost 50 million in the wake of the spy saga, while they have appealed the result of the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix, the outcome of which could yet see Hamilton handed the crown. Theyre obviously tough on us, maybe more than on others, Hamilton said. Next year, we know what to expect. You just focus on your job and just try to keep it squeaky clean, do everything perfect. Hamilton still has an outside chance of being crowned the 2007 world champion if the November 15 hearing into events at Interlagos eight days ago goes McLarens way. The team has appealed the stewards decision not to penalise Williams or BMW for fuel irregularities. Were they to be disqualified, Hamilton may be handed the points that would see him overhaul Kimi Raikkonen as champion  though the possibility appears remote. Whatever the outcome, Hamilton insists he is happy with his record-breaking year. At the beginning of the season I was saying I just want to do a good job, keep my feet on the ground and not embarrass myself and my family and friends, he said. Its been a phenomenal rollercoaster year. I dont live with regrets. Its something Ive learnt to deal with over the years. Ive reached my goal, Ive got to the Formula One. Obviously, theres another step I want to take, which is becoming world champion. Im 22 years old, this is my first year in Formula One and Ive got time to achieve that.

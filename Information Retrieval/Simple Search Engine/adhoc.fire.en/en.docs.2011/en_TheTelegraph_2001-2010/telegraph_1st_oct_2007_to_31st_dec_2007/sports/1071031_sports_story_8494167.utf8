 Daljit plan for 2011 Cup
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: BCCI pitch and grounds committee chairman Daljit Singh has proposed that Indian curators be educated and trained at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) next year, keeping in mind the 2011 World Cup. India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will co-host the meet. NCA chairman Ravi Shastri and director of operations Dav Whatmore will visit Chandigarh on November 5 to discuss Daljits proposal. I have already tabled the plan, and spoken to Ravi and (I.S.) Bindra to get the BCCI approval, the Chandigarh-based Daljit told The Telegraph on Tuesday. Daljit wants to start preparations right away so that work is completed well in time for the World Cup. By 2009, the stadiums should be ready. According to Daljits plan, all state associations will be asked send two/three malis and a turf manager (presently working as consultants like Kalyan Mitra with the CAB) to undergo training in Bangalore. Presently, even if we have state of the art technology, most malis dont know how to use it, Daljit argued. On Monday, Daljit inspected the Nehru Stadium in Guwahati where the first India versus Pakistan will be played on Monday. The Assam Cricket Association has done a good job and I can assure you that the wicket will be a good one. Daljit added that there was a lot of time to get the Eden wicket ready for the second Test to be held from November 30. Preparation work will begin on Wednesday.

 Doubles title for Sourav
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Sourav Kothari and partner Stuart Lawler, emerged champions in the Club Marconi-hosted doubles event of the Chilli Internet South Pacific Open Snooker Championship in Sydney. The city-based Sourav qualified for the doubles by finishing among the top 16 in the singles meet that concluded on Monday. Kothari finished the singles campaign with a bronze medal after losing to Australian Alan McCarthy 1-3 in the semi-finals. McCarthy went on to win the title, beating Keith Boon of Singapore 4-2. This tournament win will boost Souravs confidence on the eve of his first match in the Bob Hawke Australian Open snooker championship that got underway on Thursday. I clinched the gold medal in the doubles and bronze in the singles and am naturally quite upbeat, Sourav told The Telegraph from Mounties, Mt Pritchard, in New South Wales. Top players like Singapores Peter Gilchrist and Glen Wilkinson of Australia will vie for honours in the meet. Indias Dhruv Sitwala will also be seen in action over the next three days.

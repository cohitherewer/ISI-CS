 CRICKET BRIEFS 
						 No special security 						 for Murali				 Muralidharan						
	 Sydney: Cricket Australia on Friday denied introducing special security measures to protect Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan from crowds Down Under, saying the existing measures would catch any offenders.						
	 Muralidharan arrived this week for his first full Australia Test tour in 12 years, braced for a chilly reception from fans as he bids to break Shane Warne rsquo;s Test wicket record.
				 His arrival on Wednesday raised eyebrows when a federal police officer escorted him through the media throng in Adelaide, unusual in laid-back Australia, where England players last year often mingled freely with fans.						
	 A Sydney daily reported on Friday that plainclothes security officers would be sent to sections of Australian grounds near Muralidharan rsquo;s fielding positions to swiftly identify and eject troublemakers.						
	 Muralidharan needs just nine wickets to overhaul Warne rsquo;s 708 Test scalps in Brisbane and Hobart starting on November 8 and 16. 						 Sanath advice for youngsters						
	 Brisbane: Veteran Sri Lanka batsman Sanath Jayasuriya has told his younger teammates to ignore threats of a short-pitched barrage from Australia rsquo;s pace attack during next month rsquo;s two-Test series. ldquo;Whenever we come to Australia these are the sort of things we hear, so we just have to ignore them and do whatever we practise in the middle, rdquo; he told said on Friday. ldquo;If the short ball is there to hit, we play positive cricket. rdquo;
 ldquo;It is quite different to what we play on in Sri Lanka, so we need to get used to the conditions with practice and match practice too, rdquo; he said.						 CA questions ICC role						
	 Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) has questioned the International Cricket Council rsquo;s (ICC) dealing of the issue of racial crowd behaviour against their allrounder Andrew Symonds during the recent one-day series against India.						
	 ldquo;The wheels were in motion at ICC level but perhaps the response might have been a little more immediate to the issue or taken more seriously, rdquo; said CA chief executive James Sutherland. ldquo;It clearly was an issue and people clearly were offended by it, rdquo; he told a news conference.				 
	 Symonds was a target of racial taunts from the crowd at various venues during the seven-match series in India which was widely reported by the media and taken note of by the ICC. The ICC has, however, so far only asked for the BCCI rsquo;s version on the reported issue.

 Derby draws 85000
A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The second-leg CFL Premier Division derby, true to its status, turned out to be a crowd-puller at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. According to an IFA official, the attendance swelled to around 85,000, much to the surprise of the organisers. We expected a 50,000-odd crowd in the match, judging by the sale of tickets till Monday. But demands for tickets peaked in the morning today in the light of importance of the match, he said. Since neither the stadium authority nor the IFA keeps official record, exact attendance is not possible to know. The first-leg derby also saw attendance of similar magnitude in which Mohun Bagan beat East Bengal 4-3. The league started with chock-a-block stands in the Big Three grounds till it went for the Puja break. On resumption, it failed to generate same level of interest among the fans. After ensuring the 2-0 win, Mohun Bagan keeper Shilton Paul (who effected a number of spectacular saves in the match) was carried on the fans shoulders towards the dressing room. I want to dedicate this win to (Mohun Bagans goalkeepers coach) Hemanta Dora. Its also my answer to a former keeper who has been criticising me, Shilton said, without naming his critic.

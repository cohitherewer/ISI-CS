 Hair move pleases Ashraf
Lahore: PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said he was happy that Hair had withdrawn the racial discrimination case against the ICC. I am happy because it vindicates the stand of the ICC Executive Board that there was never any racial discrimination involved in the decision taken against him last year, he stated. Ashraf said Hair was not assigned matches of Test playing nations because of his poor judgement and behaviour. Hairs suspension was the fallout of last years Oval Test between Pakistan and England when he accused the visitors of ball tampering which led to captain Inzamam-ul Haq and his team protesting. Hair awarded the match to England, but an ICC inquiry later cleared Pakistan of ball tampering charges and banned Inzamam for four matches for bringing the game into disrepute. Hair was accused of overstepping his authority and Pakistan filed an official protest. The ICC charged Hair on several counts of violating the umpires code of conduct. Meanwhile, the PCB has asked the ICC to investigate South African umpire Rudi Koertzens alleged remark describing the Pakistan team as cheats during the World Cup earlier this year. Ashraf confirmed that a letter had been sent to the ICC asking it to investigate the issue. (PTI)

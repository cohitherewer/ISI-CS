 Marion returns Sydney medals
 Marion Jones with her 200m gold at the Sydney Games Chicago: Marion Jones returned the five medals she won at the Sydney Olympics on Monday, and agreed to forfeit all other results dating back to September 1, 2000, further punishment for her admission that she was a doping cheat. Her 100m win and long jump bronze medal at the 1999 World Championships will stand. The three gold medals and two bronzes were turned over to US Olympic Committee and US Anti-Doping Agency officials at her attorneys office in Austin. They are en route to the USOC headquarters in Colorado Springs, and the USOC will return them to the International Olympic Committee. Weve done what we can, said Jim Scherr, the USOCs chief executive officer. We caught the person who was not clean. Weve got the medals in our possession, and we will return them to IOC. Jones won golds in the 100- and 200m, as well as the 1,600 relay. She won bronzes in the 400 relay and the long jump. It will be up to the IOC to decide what to do with the medals and whether to vacate Jones results from Sydney  which could cost her relay teammates their medals, too. Scherr and USOC chairman Peter Ueberroth both said they would support the IOC nullifying the relay results, and encouraged the other Americans to give back their medals. Jearl Miles-Clark, Monique Hennagan, Tasha Colander-Richardson and Andrea Anderson all won golds as part of the 1,600m relay. Chryste Gaines, Torri Edwards, Nanceen Perry and Passion Richardson were on the 400m relay team. Both Edwards and Gaines have served doping bans since the 2000 Olympics. Its our opinion when any sporting event is won unfairly, its completely tarnished and should be returned. The relay events were won unfairly, Ueberroth said. Its very unfortunate, but your result involved cheating, so the result is unfair to the other athletes of the world. Ueberroth also said the USOC board had written letters of apology to 205 national Olympic committees, as well as to the people of Australia. As part of those apologies, Ueberroth said the USOC is pledging that it will bring a clean team to next summers Beijing Olympics. Jones pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to US government investigators about doping, saying shed taken designer steroid the clear from September 2000 to July 2001. The clear was distributed through Balco, the San Francisco-area lab that was the focus of the US governments investigation that also ensnared former sprint record holder Tim Montgomery. Montgomery is the father of Jones son Monty. No one answered the door on Monday at Jones residence in Austin. If the IOC does vacate Jones results, the standings will probably be readjusted, with the second-place finisher moving up to gold, third to silver and fourth to bronze. Jamaica won silver in the 1,600 relay, and France was fourth in the 400. Pauline Davis-Thompson of the Bahamas was the silver medallist in the 200m, and Tatiana Kotova of Russia was fourth in the long jump. The silver medallist in the 100m in Sydney was Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou  at the centre of a major doping scandal at the Athens Olympics. She and fellow-Greek runner Kostas Kenteris failed to show up for doping tests on the eve of the Games, claiming they were injured in a motorcycle accident and eventually withdrew. Both later were suspended for two years. Jones stands to lose still more. The IAAF can strip athletes of results and medals after notification of a doping violation. IAAF rules also allow for athletes found guilty of doping to be asked to pay back prize money and appearance fees, and Scherr said the USOC plans to go after Jones for any prize money that it awarded her. British sprinter Dwain Chambers, who admitted using the clear, had to pay back a reported $230,615 (euro 163,685) before he was allowed to return to competition after a two-year ban. Jones would have earned millions in prizes, bonuses and fees from meets all over the world, including a share of the $1 million (euro 710,000) Golden League jackpot in 2001 and 2002. Jones had been dogged by suspicions and doping allegations for years, angrily denying all of them. On Friday, though, she told a federal judge that then-coach Trevor Graham gave her a substance that he said was flaxseed oil but was actually the clear. (AP)

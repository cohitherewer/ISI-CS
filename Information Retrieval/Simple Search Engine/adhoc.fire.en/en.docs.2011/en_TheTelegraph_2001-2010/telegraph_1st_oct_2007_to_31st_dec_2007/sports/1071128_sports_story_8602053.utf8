 BCCI offer makes Kirsten confident
New Delhi: Former South African opener Gary Kirsten, who has emerged the frontrunner for Indias cricket coach, has said the BCCIs initiative to approach him for the post has given him the confidence to be able to do the job properly. Kirsten said he had discussions with the BCCI officials regarding the coaching job and would take a final decision after consulting his family. The most important thing is they (BCCI) approached me. I didnt approach them, so I suppose from that point of view one can be encouraged that they feel that theres something I could offer this team. And that gives me a tremendous sense of confidence to know that Ive been backed to that amount or level, Kirsten told a website on Tuesday. The former South African cricketer said the matter was still at the discussion phase and he was yet to receive a formal contract. But things should get sorted out relatively quickly either way, he said. On when he would be able to take charge, Kirsten said probably early next year. We are actually negotiating if I can join sometime during the Australia series. The most important thing is family. I have got two young kids and its a question of seeing them enough and to do the job properly. Thatll be the biggest issue and if we can get around that we can certainly move forward in the discussions. Ive had a chat with my wife already and we will take stock when I get back tomorrow, look at it from all avenues.  (PTI)

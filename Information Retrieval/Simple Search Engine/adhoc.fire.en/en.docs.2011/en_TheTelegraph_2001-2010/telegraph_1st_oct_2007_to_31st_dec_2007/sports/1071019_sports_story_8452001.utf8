 Czechs shock Germany 3-0
 Czech Republics Jan Koller (with arms raised) exults with teammates after the win over Germany in the Euro 2008 group D qualifier in Munich on Wednesday London: European champions Greece, Czech Republic and Romania will join Germany in the European Championship finals next year after qualifying on Wednesday. It was Thierry Henry who grabbed the limelight on a busy night, however, scoring twice against Lithuania to break Michel Platinis record of 41 goals for France and propel them to the top of qualifying group B. The 30-year-old Barcelona striker netted his 42nd and 43rd goals from 96 internationals in the 79th and 80th minutes. It is a huge pleasure (to break Platinis record). I cant find the words... Im overwhelmed, said Henry. We absolutely needed to win and we did it. I think of my father who is not well. Its for him. Greece, who beat hosts Portugal in the final in 2004, earned a trip to Austria and Switzerland with a 1-0 win over rivals Turkey in group C in Istanbul, with a 79th minute goal from striker Ioannis Amantidis. Turkey dropped to third place after Norway beat Bosnia 2-0 in Sarajevo and will have everything to play for when they travel to Oslo next month. The Czechs strolled to a 3-0 away win over a toothless Germany, who had already qualified from group D and were depleted by injury and suspension. Libor Sionko put them ahead in the second minute, with Marek Matejovsky adding a second in the 23rd and Jaroslav Plasil making it three in the second half. Germany had become the first country to qualify for the finals in Austria and Switzerland with a draw in Ireland on Saturday and offered precious little in response. The result left the two teams with 23 points from 10 games and ended the qualifying hopes of Ireland and Cyprus. Im very happy, Czech coach Karel Brueckner told a news conference. We worked hard in preparation and they did everything we wanted on the field. The match was disappointing across the board, said Germany coach Joachim Loew. All the things we do well were missing. We played poorly, pure and simple. It was a day to forget. Romania beat Luxembourg 2-0 away in group G with goals from Florentin Petre and Ciprian Marica, which was enough to secure qualification after Bulgaria managed only a 1-1 draw in Albania. Bulgaria cannot now catch Romania but still have a chance, in their last two games, of overtaking second-placed the Netherlands if the Dutch slip up in their last two qualifiers next month. Two second-half goals from substitute Roman Pavlyuchenko, one a controversial penalty, earned Russia a 2-1 win over England in a chilly Moscow, keeping alive their hopes of qualifying from group E and putting Englands in jeopardy. The rejuvenated Russians now have to win away matches against already-eliminated Israel and Andorra to qualify. Croatia face Macedonia away before finishing their campaign against England at Wembley on November 21, and needing only one point from the two games to get through. Portugal earned three points in group A when goals from Ariza Makukula and Cristiano Ronaldo gave them a 2-1 win over Kazakhstan. The group is too close to call, with leaders Poland, Portugal, Finland and Serbia, who romped to a 6-1 win over bottom side Azerbaijan in Baku, having two games to play and all still in with a chance of reaching the finals.

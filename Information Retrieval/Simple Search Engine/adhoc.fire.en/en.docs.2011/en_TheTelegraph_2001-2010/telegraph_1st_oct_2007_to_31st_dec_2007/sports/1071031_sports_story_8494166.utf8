 Sheshiah stays defiant
Kingston: The Jamaican government pathologist who performed an autopsy on Bob Woolmer again defended his findings that the Pakistan coach was the victim of foul play during a testy exchange with an attorney representing the sports governing body. Dr Ere Sheshiah was criticised for not following usual global practices on the 10th day of the inquest. Under questioning by an International Cricket Council (ICC) lawyer, Sheshiah on Monday reiterated his conclusion that the 58-year-old coach died of asphyxia and pesticide poisoning and said he did not consider other findings valid. I am not deviating from my findings, said the pathologist. I have already told the court of my opinion. Sheshiah was also criticised for not following international practice in the post-mortem by reviewing pathologists Lorna Martin of South Africa, Nathaniel Carey of Britain and Michael Pallanen of Canada, who studied video and photos. Sheshiah, who was the only person with access to the body, said under questioning that there are times when one can divert from global practice to satisfy themselves. Sheshaiah originally had said Woolmers hyoid bone was fractured. But when given the X-ray in court last week, he admitted he had made a mistake, then insisted the hyoid bone in a 58-year-old man does not have to be broken to prove that he was strangled. That led to questioning by ICC attorney Jermaine Spence, who attacked the doctors credibility, saying his findings were unreliable and wondering how anyone could accept his findings. (AGENCIES)

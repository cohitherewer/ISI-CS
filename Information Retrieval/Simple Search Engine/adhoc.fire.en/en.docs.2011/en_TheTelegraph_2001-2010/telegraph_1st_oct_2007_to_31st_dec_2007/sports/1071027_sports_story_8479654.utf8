 Flawless round by Digvijay 
Jakarta: Digvijay Singhs flawless six-under 66 lit up an otherwise gloomy day as darkness led to suspension of play in the second round of the $ 350,000 Indonesia Presidents Invitational here on Friday. Digvijay was in the sole fourth position after returning the second best card of the day  studded with six birdies, four of them coming in the front nine. The Indian was a stroke behind leaders Neven Basi of Australia, American Anthony King and Chinese Taipeis Lu Wei-chih. Among other Indians, only five managed to complete their rounds with four of them finishing over-par. Gurbaaz Mann, who was tied sixth, was left reeling at tied 63rd. Harmeet Kahlon, tied fourth in the previous round,was on the third hole when the play came to a haltleaving him overall six-under and tied for the 11th spot. Gaganjeet Bhullar was three holes from finishing his round, which was going two-under. Bhullar was at the tied 27th spot while Amandeep Johl s improved effort of a two-under 70 is almost certain to earn him the cut as he finished at even-par 144. Arjun Atwals woeful run of form, meanwhile, continued as a horrendous back-nine left him two-over 73 and tied for the 88th spot after the opening round of $575,000 Miccosukee Championship in the US Nationwide Tour. Atwal, who is struggling to maintain his place inside the top 60 of the money list to qualify for next weeks Nationwide Tour, managed just two birdies against four bogeys. American Dustin Bay returned a flawless six-under 65 to take a one-stroke lead over compatriot D. A. Points. Argetine Fabian Gomez occupied the third position with a 67.  (PTI)

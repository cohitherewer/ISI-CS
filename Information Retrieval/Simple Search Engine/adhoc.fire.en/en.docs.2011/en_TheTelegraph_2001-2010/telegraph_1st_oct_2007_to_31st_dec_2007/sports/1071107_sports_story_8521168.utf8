 Desi formula claims to better D/L method
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: The calculation of target scores in interrupted matches has come in for plenty of debate. The Duckworth-Lewis system has been successfully put to use, but is there a better system? V. Jayadevan, an engineer from Thrissur, has devised a method that claims to be superior to the existing formula. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has already put it to use in all domestic one-day matches from this season. Developing a method means trying to represent the equations and tables that normally happens on the field. D-L tried to simulate it in one way and I did it another way. In more than 80 per cent of the cases these two provide similar results. In the remaining 20 per cent, I claim my results are better. Many experts are also of the same opinion, though the ICC is yet to give me a proper opportunity to prove it, Jayadevan told The Telegraph. Jayadevans method, what he calls the VJD System, is based on a mathematical model of the natural development of an innings through its various stages of settling down, making use of field restrictions, mid stages of stabilising, acceleration and the slog overs. Based on the general scoring pattern and research of past matches, a normal statistical curve has been developed. Regression analysis was carried out using spread sheet software. A cubical polynomial equation was used for determining the scoring pattern. Putting all this into use, Jayadevan has generated a target curve. He also provides a target table where the revised target can be computed depending on the percentage of total overs that were completed for different percentages of wickets. To make the entire process easy, a computer programme has been devised. Jayadevan started to work on the VJD System in 1998 and gave it a proper shape in 2001. The same year former India captain Sunil Gavasakar gave Jayadevan an opportunity to present his case before the BCCI. A fact acknowledged by the 44-year-old. It is mainly because of the great support from Gavaskar that all this has happened. Most of the top BCCI officials (other than Gavaskar who is the technical committee chairman) have not understood the value of the work or the effort behind it, he said. Not much recognition has been available too. Except for Gavaskar, not many have praised the effort. Theres no doubt that the D/L method has assumed much acknowledgement. But Jayadevans system demands closer scrutiny from the ICC.

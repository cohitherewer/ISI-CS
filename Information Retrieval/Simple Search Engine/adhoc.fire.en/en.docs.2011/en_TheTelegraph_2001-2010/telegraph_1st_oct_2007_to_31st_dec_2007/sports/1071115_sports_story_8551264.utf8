 Ive never changed the way I do things, says Sachin
 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
 -  The maestro turns 18 today! LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI		Sachin TendulkarCalcutta: Come Thursday and 34-year-old Sachin Tendulkar, the sports senior-most pro, will complete 18 years as an India cricketer. Sachin, who is in Gwalior with the Mahendra Singh Dhonis, spoke to The Telegraph from the team hotel (Usha Kiran Palace) there. The following are excerpts On being hours from completing 18 years of international cricket To be honest, I havent given the date much thought... All I can say is that Ive enjoyed every minute of playing for India... Having put in so many years gives a nice feeling. On memories of November 15, 1989 (After a pause) I was tense... I was nervous... I was also excited... It was a big moment for me then and remains a huge moment even now... Its difficult describing the emotions and, to be frank, I just didnt know what to expect... That Pakistan batted first allowed my nerves to settle down. On whether hed slept well the night before I did, in fact... On whether hed done anything different that morning Not really... As usual, I said my prayers. On whod informed him that he would be making his Test debut (youngest for India) From what I remember, both (captain Krishnamachari) Srikkanth and manager (Chandu) Borde... They spoke to me during the team meeting the previous evening. Id got 40-odd in the lead-up game and, so, was expecting to make the XI. On whether any teammate had something special to say once the XI was announced I cant recall anything in particular... As that was the first morning of the series, I suppose everyone was busy with his own preparations. On how far hed hoped to go after getting his maiden Test cap Didnt think of anything except putting my best foot forward... At that age, all that mattered was the excitement of playing for India... It was the realisation of a dream... I didnt, for a moment, think of the consequences of not scoring or the benefits of scoring... I scored 15 in the only innings I batted and was struck by the sharp difference in pace at the Test level. [Pakistans fiery attack included captain Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and debutant Waqar Younis. Its the last-named who got Sachins wicket.] On the past 18 years I thank the Almighty for giving me the opportunities... Im still learning... Cricket is a sport where you never stop doing so. On whether he has now set sights on turning 21 (Laughs) Im not looking that much into the future... Today, Im happy with the way this journey has gone... On the added pressure of being a national icon Ive never changed as a person... Never changed the way I do things... Obviously, people have liked me for what I am and, so, there hasnt been reason to change... That people see me as an icon is humbling... I value the respect given to me. The affection too. On whether, with 37 Test hundreds and 41 in ODIs, he still has a goal to achieve Im enjoying what Im doing and want to continue things the same way... Theres nothing more... My goal, then, is to enjoy... On whether, having turned down the Test captaincy, hell be focusing that much more on batting (Interrupting) Arent we just talking of my 18 years? Finally, his message to rookies Go and enjoy yourself without worrying about the result... Youve been picked because the selectors have seen something in you, have seen you make a mark in domestic cricket... So, carry on in that manner and dont try to change your game Look to make a similar impact (in international cricket) Nothing should matter more than enjoying what youre doing. That, for me, is the best approach.the tendulkaR FACTFILE

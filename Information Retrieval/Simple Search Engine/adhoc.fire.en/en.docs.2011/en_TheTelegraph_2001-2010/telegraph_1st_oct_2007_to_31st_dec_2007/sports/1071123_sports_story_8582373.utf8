 Brazil ride Fabiano double 
 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil came from behind to beat Uruguay 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday but were overshadowed by Paraguay and Ecuador who both went on scoring sprees. Luis Fabiano scored a brace as Brazil overcame their smaller neighbours in Sao Paulo on a night when they were heavily indebted to goalkeeper Julio Cesar. Paraguay won 3-0 in Chile to go on top of the South American qualifying group and Ecuador, who conceded five goals in each of their last two games, beat Peru 5-1 to pick up their first points. With four of the 18 rounds of matches played in the 10-team group, Paraguay lead with 10 points followed by Argentina (9), Brazil and Colombia (8), Venezuela (6), Uruguay and Chile (4), Ecuador (3), Peru (2) and Bolivia (1).
